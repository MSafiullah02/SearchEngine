Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living. The second category was \"challenges of working on COVID-19 wards\". Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation. The third category was \"resilience amid challenges\". Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation. They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience.",

As of April 22, 2020, there have been 2 471 136 confirmed cases worldwide, with 169 006 deaths; 1 82 798 confirmed cases and 4632 deaths have been reported in mainland China. 2 The rapidly evolving epidemic has stressed the entire Chinese health-care system, especially in Wuhan, Hubei province. When fever clinics and respiratory and infectious disease units in Wuhan were overwhelmed by the increasing number of suspected and confirmed cases in the early stages of the outbreak, general wards were quickly modified into isolation wards, and health-care providers who did not have infectious disease expertise stepped up to provide care for patients with COVID-19. As the epidemic progressed in Hubei province, more local health-care providers joined the epidemic control efforts, and 42 000 health-care providers (including 28 600 nurses) from across China came to Hubei to support them. 3 Health-care providers are vital resources for every country. Their health and safety are crucial not only for continuous and safe patient care, but also for control of any outbreak. 4 However, health-care providers caring for patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were under extraordinary stress related to high risk of infection, stigmatisation, understaffing, and uncertainty, and comprehensive support was a high priority during the outbreaks and afterwards. 5, 6 Quantitative studies have shown that frontline healthcare providers treating patients with COVID-19 have greater risks of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress. 7 Frontline physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise had additional challenges when they adjusted to an entirely new working environment in this stressful situation. To our knowledge, no qualitative studies of the experiences of these health-care providers have been published. To support them effectively, it is necessary to gain insights into their lived experience.",

Although a majority (68%) of frontline health-care providers were nurses, they still had heavy workloads. 3 In addition to providing care to patients, wearing PPE for long hours also led to physical distress, especially for nurses who had to stay in the isolation wards for entire shifts. Intensive work for long hours made health-care providers at risk of decreased immunity. When healthcare workers became sick, there was concern regarding their ability to curb the outbreak and treat patients. When a health-care crisis as large as SARS-CoV-2 occurs, it is important for authorities to emphasise the importance of self-care, set maximal working hours and arrange shifts reasonably to protect health-care providers from overwork. 14 Patients with COVID-19 need both comprehensive and specific management, and the outbreak brings great challenges to health-care systems, especially critical care medicine. Many health-care providers from other departments had few clinical experiences in infectious intensive care. When health-care systems are not ready to handle the outbreak of an infectious disease, training, education, and improved communication are needed. 15 Temporary efforts to provide intensive training increased caregiver knowledge and skills. Continuous medical education and training is needed to assure medical teams are adequately prepared to deal with public health emergencies. 16 When personnel from different specialties and hospitals work together, differences might exist in corporate cultures, procedures, and communication. The promotion of interprofessional and interorganisational collaboration should be a priority to ensure efficient and high-quality care. Nurses have a leading role in facilitating communication and collaboration among health-care team members; mutual trust and respectful environments should be developed, efficient communication maintained, the role of individuals and teams clarified, standardised procedures established, and a sense of belonging fostered. 17 In the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, because of insufficient understanding of the virus and prevention and control measures, more than 3000 medical staff were infected in Hubei, 40% of whom were infected in hospitals. 18 Health-care providers experienced persistent fear of infection due to the contagious nature of the virus, unknown tran smission modes, close contact with patients, and infection happening to their colleagues. Infection among health-care workers has been a problem during other outbreaks. During the SARS epidemic, nurses' higher levels of trust in equipment or infection control initiatives were related to lower levels of emotional exhaustion and state anger. 19 Workforce safety is a high priority. To help health-care providers reduce uncertainty and fear, in addition to improving knowledge of infection prevention and control and personal protection skills, hospitals need to provide a safe working environment and sufficient protective supplies and have personnel responsible for continuous training, monitoring, and supervision of infection prevention and control. Sound infection prevention practices are also needed in the living quarters of medical teams from other provinces. For frontline health-care providers who lived at home, the concerns about transmitting the virus to family members need to be addressed. Supportive conversations and recom mendations, such as separation of living spaces, changing clothing, and immediately showering after duty, might help to reduce anxiety. 14 In the face of various challenges, health-care providers showed great strength and resilience. They used multiple support systems and self-adjustment skills to relieve stress, because they knew they needed to be strong and focus on their duty in order to save more lives. However, health-care providers in this study also expressed grief and a strong sense of powerlessness about patients' suffering and the sudden loss of lives. During the SARS and MERS epidemics, frontline health-care providers were fearful, anxious, and frustrated and were at higher risk of mental health problems after the epidemic (eg, post-traumatic stress disorder). 5, 6, 19 Although participants in this study thought they were able to deal with their emotional stress without professional support, their mental health should be continuously monitored, support systems strengthened, and professional psychological counselling and crisis interventions provided.",
