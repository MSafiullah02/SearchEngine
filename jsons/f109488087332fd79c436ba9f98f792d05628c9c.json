About 30-50% of workers are still exposed to such hazards. There is thus need to still develop risk assessment, prevention and control methods and programmes for these often well-known hazards. In many industrialized countries, prevention and control programmes have had a positive impact by reducing the trends of occupational diseases and accidents, particularly in big industries. Some developing countries, however, show an increase in traditional hazards. International comparisons, however, are difficult to make because of poor coverage, underreporting, and poor harmonization of concepts, definitions and registration criteria.",

The majority of countries, however, have shown declining trends in accident rates irrespective of the absolute numbers of accidents. Some exceptions to this general trend have nevertheless been seen. The accident risk also seems to shift somewhat as regards location, so that instead of risks related to machines and tools, particularly the risks in internal transportation and traffic within the workplace grow in relative importance. This trend may increase in future, particularly as the work place, as well as the speed and volume of material flows are increasing. A threat is caused by lengthened working hours, which tend to affect the vigilance of workers and increase the risk of errors. Small-scale enterprises and micro-enterprises are known to have a lower capacity for occupational health and safety than larger ones. In fact, a higher accident risk has been noted in medium-sized companies, and a lower risk in very small and very large enterprises. We can conclude that this is due to the higher mechanization level and energy use in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) compared with micro-enterprises, which usually produce services. On the other hand, the better capacity of very large enterprises in safety management is demonstrated by their low accident rates.",

The European Union (EU) is the largest chemical producer in the world, the USA the second, and Japan the third. There are some 100,000 different chemical entities in industrial use, but only about 2,500 are so-called high-production volume (HPV) chemicals produced (and consumed) in amounts exceeding 1,000 tons a year. The number of chemicals produced in amounts of 10-1,000 tons a year is about 25,000. But volume is not necessarily the most important aspect in chemical safety at work. Reactivity, toxicological properties, and how the chemicals are used, are more important. The European chemical companies number some 39,000, and in addition there are 36,000 plants producing plastics and rubber. Surprisingly, as many as 96% of these are SMEs employing fewer than 50 workers, and 70% are micro-enterprises employing fewer than 10 workers. Thus, the common belief that the chemical industry constitutes only large firms is not true. Small enterprises and self-employed people have much less competence to deal with chemical risk assessment and management than the large companies. Guidance and support in chemical safety is therefore crucial for them.",

The workers are exposed simultaneously to traditional industrial chemicals, such as heavy metals, solvents and pyrolytic products, and to \"new exposures\", such as plastics monomers and oligomers, highly reactive additives, cross-linkers and hardeners, as well as to, for example, fungal spores or volatile compounds in contaminated buildings. This implies that some 40 million people in the EU15 are exposed at work, and usually the level of exposure is one to three orders of magnitude higher than in any other environment. About the same proportion (25% of the workforce, i.e. 500,000) of the Finnish workers in the national survey reported exposure.

All three have been found to present special occupational health and even safety problems, which are not yet fully solved. The design of new more user-friendly technology is highly desirable, and the criteria for such technology need to be generated by experts in neurophysiology, cognitive psychology and ergonomics. It is important to note that the productivity and quality of information-intensive work requiring the use of ICT depends crucially on the user-friendliness of the new technology interface, both the hardware and software. Communication and information technologies will change job contents, organization of work, working methods and competence demands substantially in all sectors of the economy in all countries.

The aim is to identify performance limits, the limits of training and practice, and to put them into positive use. Adaptation and fatigue are the central elements here. \u2022 The third approach for prevention is related to reducing strain. The aim is to avoid harm, using known limits as guidelines (e.g. maximum workplace concentration limit values for harmful substances, maximum organspecific concentration values, biological tolerance values for substances, limit values for noise and physical loads). However, the use of guideline values can only be an auxiliary approach, because the stress-strain concept is characterized by highly complex connections between the exogenous stress and the resulting strain. An objectively identical stress will not always cause the same level of strain in an individual. Due to action regulation and individual characteristic values and curves of the organ systems (properties and capabilities), differences in strain may occur. Seemingly identical stress can cause differing strain due to the superposition of partial stress. Combinations of partial stress can lead to compensatory differences (e.g. physiological stress can compensate for psychological stress) or accumulation effects. Partial stress is determined by the intensity and duration of the stress, and can therefore appear in differing dimensions and have varying effects. In assessing overall stress, the composition of the partial stress according to type, intensity, course and time is decisive. Partial stress can occur simultaneously and successively. In our considerations, the principle of homeostasis plays an important role.",

Harm is a bionegative effect of stress. The causative stress is part of complex conditions in a causal connection. Causal relationships can act as dose-effect relationships or without any relation to the dose. In this respect, the causative stress condition can form a chain with a fixed or variable sequence; it can add up, multiply, intensify or have an effect in only specific combinations, and generate different effects (e.g. diseases). We are thus dealing with a multicausal model or a multi-factor genesis. Low back pain is an example of a complex phenomenon. The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, especially low back pain, is rapidly increasing. Several occupational factors have been found to increase the risk for low back pain. Some studies indicate that psychosocial and work-related conditions are far more accurate in the prognosis of disability than are physical conditions. Chronic low back pain is perceived as a phenomenon which encompasses biological, social and psychological variables. According to the model of adaptation, the goal of reducing risks is to increase a person's physical abilities (i.e. flexibility, strength, endurance), the use of body mechanics, techniques to protect the back (following the rules of biomechanics), to improve positive coping skills and emotional control.",

Geographical arrangements, block diagrams, material flow charts, information flow charts, energy flow charts, etc. are used to depict technical systems. The objective is to ensure the safe behaviour of the technical systems by design methods, at least during the required service life and during intended use. Qualitative analyses are particularly important in practice. As a rule, they are form sheet analyses and include failure mode and effect analyses, which examine and determine failure modes and their effects on systems. The preliminary hazard analysis looks for the hazard potentials of a system. The failure hazard analysis examines the causes of failures and their effects. The operating hazard analysis determines the hazards which may occur during operation, maintenance, repair, etc. The human error mode and effect analysis examines error modes and their effects which occur because of wrong behaviour of humans. The information error mode and effect analysis examines operating, maintenance and repair errors, fault elimination errors and the effects caused by errors in instructions and faulty information.",

The recent ILO estimate discloses 2.4 million deaths a year from work-related causes in the world including deaths from accidents, dangerous substances, and occupational diseases. Eightyfive percent (85%) of these deaths take place in developing countries, where the diagnostic services, social security to families and compensation to workers are less developed. Although the risk is decreasing in the industrialized world, the trend is increasing in the rapidly industrializing and transitory countries.

About 200 biological factors that are hazardous to workers' health have been identified in various work environments. Some of the new diseases recognized are blood-borne infections, such as hepatitis C and HIV, and exotic bacterial or viral infections transmitted by increasing mobility, international travelling and migration of working people. Also some hospital infections and, e.g., drug-resistant tuberculosis, are being contracted increasingly by health care personnel. In the developing countries the morbidity picture of occupational diseases is much less clear for several reasons: low recognition rates, rotation and turnover of workers, shorter life expectancy which hides morbidity with a long latency period, and the work-relatedness of several common epidemic diseases, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS (Rantanen 2003).",

The content of the concept varies, depending on the context: a) The medical concept of occupational disease is based on a biomedical or other health-related etiological relationship between work and health, and is used in occupational health practice and clinical occupational medicine. b) The legal concept of occupational disease defines the disease or conditions which are legally recognized as conditions caused by work, and which lead to liabilities for recognition, compensation and often also prevention. The legal concept of occupational disease has a different background in different countries, often declared in the form of an official list of occupational diseases.",

Occupational diseases, with the exception of a few acute cases, are silent, develop slowly, and concern only one or a few individuals at a time. Furthermore, the diseases take months or years to develop, in extreme cases even decades, after the exposure or as a consequence of accumulation of exposure during several years. As occupational health problems are difficult to detect and seriously under-diagnosed and under-reported, they tend to be given less priority than accidents. The perception of occupational disease risk remains low in spite of their severity and relatively high incidence. Particularly in industrialized countries, the extent of occupational health problems is substantially greater than that of occupational accidents. On a global scale, the estimated number of fatalities due to occupational accidents is 375,000 and the respective estimate for fatalities due to work-related diseases is 1.8 million a year, giving a fatal accident/fatal disease ratio of 1 to 5.

Between 35% and 50% of EU workers in certain occupations report psychological stress due to high time pressure at work (Parent-Thirion et al. 2007 ). The occurrence of work-related stress is most prevalent in occupations with tight deadlines, pressure from clients, or the high level of responsibility for productivity and quality given to the workers. Undoubtedly, the threat of unemployment increases the perception of stress as well. As a consequence, for example, in Finland some 40% of workers report symptoms of psychological overload and about 7% show clinical signs of burn out. These are not the problems of low-paid manual workers only, but also, for example, highly educated and well-paid computer super-experts have an elevated risk of burnout as a consequence of often self-committed workload (Kalimo and Toppinen 1997) .",

Under the production conditions those days (hunter-gatherer culture) this population level was the limit for the human species within the framework of an economic form that only interfered slightly with man's natural environment. The neolithic revolution brought a dramatic change: the carrying capacity of the world for human beings increased by a factor of 10 and more. This agrarian pre-industrial cultural form was characterized by tightly limited carrying capacity, in around 1750 the earth was capable of feeding approx. 750 million people. Today the world supports 6 billion people -and this figure is rising. The carrying capacity in comparison to the Neolithic age has thus increased thousand-fold and continues to grow in parallel to new changes in production conditions (Fritsch 1993; Kesselring 1994; Mohr 1995) . The five \"Promethean innovations\" are behind this tremendous achievement of human culture: mastering fire, using the natural environment for agriculture, transforming fossil fuels into thermal and mechanical energy, industrial production and substituting material with information (Renn 1996) .",

For example, the philosopher Klaus Michael Meyer-Abich sees the situation as follows: \". . . we humans are not there to leave the world as though we had never been there. As with all other life forms, it is also part of our nature and our lives to bring about changes in the world.

With this comparison, it can be seen that even serious interventions in nature and the environment did not occur without reflection, but to provide the growing number of people with goods and services; these people need them to survive or as a prerequisite for a \"good\" life. However, at the same time it must be kept in mind that these interventions often inflict irreversible damage on the environment and destroy possible future usage potentials for future generations. Above and beyond this, for the human race, nature is a cradle of social, cultural, aesthetic and religious values, the infringement of which, in turn, has a major influence on people's well-being.

Obviously, not all people act according to the standards that they themselves see as necessary, but they are capable of doing so.

They gain their normative force solely from the fact that they exist and instigate human action (normative force of actual action). Most ethicists agree that no conclusions about general validity can be drawn from the actual existence of standards. This would be a naturalistic fallacy (Akademie der Wissenschaften 1992, Ott 1999) . Nevertheless, experienced morality can be an important indicator of different, equally justifiable moral systems, especially where guidance for cross-cultural behaviour is concerned. This means that the actual behaviour of many people with regard to their natural environment reveals which elements of this environment they value in particular and which they do not. However, in this case, too, the validity of the standards is not derived from their factuality, but merely used as a heurism in order to find an adequate (possibly culture-immanent) justification.",

Because, regardless of whether the basic axioms of moral rules are taken from intuition, observations of nature, religion, tradition reasoning or common sense, they have broadly similar contents. Thus, there is broad consensus that each human individual has a right to life, that human freedom is a high-value good and that social justice should be aimed at. But there are obviously many different opinions about what these principles mean in detail and how they should be implemented. In spite of this plurality, however, discerning and well-intentioned observers can usually quickly agree, whether one of the basic principles has clearly been infringed. It is more difficult to decide whether they have clearly been fulfilled or whether the behaviour to be judged should clearly be assigned to one or several principles. Since there is no finally binding body in a secular society that can specify primary principles or standards ex cathedra, in this case consensus among equally defendable standards or principles can be used (or pragmatically under certain conditions also majority decisions). Ethical considerations are still useful in this case as they allow the test of generalization and the enhancement of awareness raising capabilities. In particular, they help to reveal the implications of such primary principles and standards.",

In both cases the main concern is to use the consensually agreed primary principles to derive secondary principles of general action and standards of specific action that should be preferred over alternatives that can be equally justified. A plurality of solutions should be expected especially because most of the concrete options for action comprise only a gradual fulfilment and infringement of primary principles and therefore also include conflicting values. For value conflicts at the same level of abstraction there are, by definition, no clear rules for solution. There are therefore frequently conflicts between conserving life through economic development and destroying life through environmental damage. Since the principle of conserving life can be used for both options a conflict is unavoidable in this case. To solve the conflicts, ethical considerations, such as the avoidance of extremes, staggering priorities over time or the search for third solutions can help without, however, being able to convincingly solve this conflict in principle to the same degree for all (Szejnwald-Brown et al. 1993) .",

When dealing with the environment, the traditional basic and human rights, as well as the civil rights that have been derived from them, should be just as much a foundation of the consideration as other areas of application in ethics. However, with regard to the primary principles there is a special transfer problem when addressing human interventions into nature and the environment: does the basic postulate of conservation of life apply only to human beings, to all other creatures or to all elements of nature, too? This question does not lead to a new primary principle, as one may suspect at first glance. Much rather, it is concerned with the delineation of the universally recognized principle of the conservation of life that has already been specified in the basic rights canon. Are only people included in this principle (this is the codified version valid in most legal constitutions today) or other living creatures, too? And if yes, which ones? Should non-living elements be included as well? When answering this question, two at first sight contradictory positions can be derived: anthropocentrism and physiocentrism (Taylor 1986 , Ott 1993 , Galert 1998 . The anthropocentric view places humans and their needs at the fore. Nature's own original demands are alien to this view. Interventions in nature are allowed if they are useful to human society. A duty to make provisions for the future and to conserve nature exists in the anthropocentric world only to the extent that natural systems are classed as valuable to people today and subsequent generations and that nature can be classed as a means and guarantor of human life and survival (Norton 1987 , Birnbacher 1991b .",

In turn, with a purely physiocentric approach the primary principles of freedom, equality and human dignity could not be maintained at all if every part of living nature were equally entitled to use the natural environment.

His most well-known work \"A Sand County Almanac\" is sustained by the attempt to observe and assess human activities from the viewpoint of the land (a mountain or an animal). This perspective was clearly physiocentric and revealed fundamental insights about the relationship between humans and nature on the basis of empathy and shifting perspectives. His point of view had a strong influence on American environmental ethics and the stance of conservationists. Although this physiocentric perspective raises many concerns, the idea of stewardship has been one of the guiding ideas for the arguments used in this section (Pickett et al. 1997) . We are morally required to exercise a sort of stewardship over living nature, because nature cannot claim any rights for itself, but nevertheless has exceptional value that is important to man above and beyond its economic utility value (H\u00f6sle 1991) .",

But we should avoid premature conclusions here, as can be seen with the example of species protection.

An environmental initiative to save cockroaches would not be likely to gain supporters. If we look at the situation carefully, the valuation of human behaviour in these examples results from a conflict. Because the conservation of the species competes with the objective of maintaining human health or the objective of a hygienic place to live, two principles, possibly of equal ranking, come face to face. In this case the options for action, which may all involve a gradual infringement of one or more principles, would have to be weighed up against each other.

This refers to intervention threats to the systemic functions of the biosphere. Such threats are one of the guiding principles that must not be exceeded under any circumstances, even if this excess were to be associated with high benefits. In the language of ethics this is a categorical principle, in the language of economics a good that is not capable of being traded.

Accordingly, all interventions in which important substance or energy cycles are significantly influenced at a global level and where globally effective negative impacts are to be expected are categorically prohibited. Usually no stringently causal evidence of the harmful nature of globally relevant information is needed; justified suspicion of such harmfulness should suffice. Later in this chapter we will make a proposal for risk valuation and management how the problem of uncertainty in the event of possible catastrophic damage potential should be dealt with (risk type Cassandra). On the second level, the protection of ecosystems and landscapes, it is much more difficult to draw up categorical rules. Initially, it is obvious that all interventions in landscapes in which the global functions mentioned on the first level are endangered must be avoided. Above and beyond this, it is wise from a precautionary point of view to maintain as much ecosystem diversity as possible in order to keep the degree of vulnerability to the unforeseen or even unforeseeable consequences of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic interventions as low as possible. Even though it is difficult to derive findings for human behaviour from observations of evolution, the empirically proven statement \"he who places everything on one card, always loses in the long run\" seems to demonstrate a universally valid insight into the functioning of systemically organized interactions. For this reason, the conservation of the natural diversity of ecosystems and landscape forms is a categorical principle, whereas the depth of intervention allowed should be specified on the basis of principles and standards capable of compensation.",

Here too, initially the causal chain should be laid down: species conservation, landscape conservation, maintaining global functions. Wherever this chain is unbroken, a categorical order of conservation should apply. These species could be termed primary key species. This includes such species that are not only essential for the specific landscape type in which they occur, but also for the global cycles above and beyond this specific landscape type thanks to their special position in the ecosystem. Probably, it will not be possible to organize all species under this functional contribution to the surrounding ecosystem, but we could also think of groups of species, for example, humus-forming bacteria. In second place there are the species that characterize certain ecosystems or landscapes. Here they are referred to as secondary key species. They, too, are under special protection that is not necessarily under categorical reservations. Their function value, however, is worthy of special attention. Below these two types of species there are the remaining species that perform ecosystem functions to a greater or lesser extent. What this means for the worthiness for protection of these species and the point at which the precise limit for permitted intervention should be drawn, is a question that can no longer be solved with categorical principles and standards, but with the help of compensatory principles and standards. Generally, here, too, as with the issue of ecosystem and landscape protection, the conservation of diversity as a strategy of \"reinsurance\" against ignorance, global risks and unforeseeable surprises is recommended.",

Although such a dominant (the best for all categories) or sub-dominant option (the worst for all categories) is rare in reality, there are examples of dominant or sub-dominant solutions. Thus, for example, the overfelling of the forests of Kalimantan on the island of Borneo in Indonesia can be classed as a sub-dominant option since the short-term benefit, even with extremely high discount rates, is in no proportion to the long-term losses of benefits associated with a barren area covered in Imperata grass. The recultivation of a barren area of this kind requires sums many times the income from the sale of the wood, including interest.

The discussion about the value dimensions to be used as a basis for valuation is one of the most popular subjects within environmental ethics.

The use of environmental resources is an anthropological necessity. Human consciousness works reflexively and humans have developed a causal recognition capacity that enables them to record cause and effect anticipatively and to productively incorporate assessed consequences in their own action. This knowledge is the motivating force behind the cultural evolution and the development of technologies, agriculture and urbanization. With power over an ever-increasing potential of design and intervention in nature and social affairs over the course of human history, the potential for abuse and exploitation has also grown. Whereas this potential was reflected in philosophical considerations and legal standards at a very early stage with regard to moral standards between people, the issue of human responsibility towards nature and the environment has only become the subject of intensive considerations in recent times. Ethical considerations are paramount in this respect. On the one hand, they offer concrete standards for human conduct on the bases of criteria that can be generalized, and, on the other hand, they provide procedural advice about a rational and decision-and policy-making process.",

Here are three strategies of environmental protection to be helpful for the implementation of categor-ical guidelines. The first strategy is that of complete protection with severe restrictions of all use by humans (protection priority). The second strategy provides for a balanced relationship between protection and use, where extensive resource use should go hand in hand with the conservation of the ecosystems concerned (equal weight). The third strategy is based on optimum use involving assurance of continuous reproduction. The guiding principle here would be an intensive and, at the same time, sustainable, i.e. with a view to the long term, use of natural resources (use priority).",

Should we simply accept the results of opinion polls as the basis for making political decisions? Can we rely on risk perception results to judge the seriousness of pending risks? Or should we place all our faith in professional risk management? If we turn to professional help to deal with plural value input, economic theory might provide us an answer to this problem. If environmental goods are made individual and suitable for the market by means of property rights, the price that forms on the market ensures an appropriate valuation of the environmental good. Every user of this good can then weigh up whether he is willing to pay the price or would rather not use the good. With many environmental goods, however, this valuation has to be made by collective action, because the environmental good concerned is a collective or open access good. In this case a process is needed that safeguards the valuation and justifies it to the collective. However, this valuation cannot be determined with the help of survey results.

It is useful to separate questions of evidence with respect to the likelihood, magnitude of consequences and related characteristics (which can involve complexity and uncertainty) from valuation of the consequences (i.e. ambiguity).

At the same time, ignoring major sources of uncertainty can evoke a sense of security and overconfidence that is not justified from the quality or extent of the data base (Einhorn and Hogarth 1978) . Perceptions and world views may be very important, and difficult to sort out from matters of science, especially with large uncertainties about the causes of environmental damage.",

DA can only offer coherent conclusions from the information which the decision maker provides by his/her preferences among consequences and his/her state of information on the occurrence of these consequences. Where there is disagreement about the preferences or about the information, DA may be used to implore the implications of such disagreement. So in application, there is often a great deal of iteration (sensitivity analysis) to explore how differences in judgement should affect the selection of the best action alternative. DA thus merely offers a formal framework that can be effective in helping participants in a decision process to better understand the implications of differing information and judgement about complex and uncertain consequences from the choice among the available action alternatives. Insight about which factors are most important in selecting among the alternatives is often the most important output of the process, and it is obtained through extensive and iterative exchange between analysts and the decision makers and stakeholders. The main advantage of the framework is that it is based on logic that is both explicit and checkable -usually facilitated by the use of mathematical models and probability calculations. Research on human judgement supports the superiority of such procedures for decomposing complex decision problems and using logic to integrate the pieces, rather than relying on holistic judgement on which of the alternatives is best (this is not only true for individual decisions, see Heap et al. 1992 : 36ff., Jungermann 1986 ; but also for collective decisions, see Heap et al. 1992 : 197ff., Pettit 1991 . One should keep in mind, however, that \"superior\" is measured in accordance with indicator of instrumental rationality, i.e. measuring means-ends effectiveness. If this rationality is appropriate, the sequence suggested by DA is intrinsically plausible and obvious. Even at the level of qualitative discussion and debate, groups often explore the rationale for different action alternatives. Decision analysis simply uses formal quantitative methods for this traditional and common-sense process of exploring the rationale -using models to describe complexity, probability to describe uncertainty, and to deal with ambiguity, explicit valuation of consequences via utility theory and other balancing procedures, such as cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analyses. By decomposing the problem in logical steps, the analysis permits better understanding of differences in the participants' perspective on evidence and values. DA offers methods to overcome these differences, such as resolving questions about underlying science through data collection and research, and encouraging tradeoffs, compromise, and rethinking of values.",

Collectively the analytical tools provide a framework for a systematic process of exploring and evaluating the decision alternatives -assembling and validating the applicable scientific evidence relevant to what will happen as the result of each possible choice, and valuing how bad or how good these consequences are based on an agreement of common objectives.

Deliberation helps to make a society aware of the options, interpretations, and potential actions that are connected with the issue under investigation (Wynne 1992, De Marchi and Ravetz 1999) . Each position within a deliberative discourse can only survive the crossfire of arguments and counter-arguments if it demonstrates internal consistency, compatibility with the legitimate range of knowledge claims and correspondence with the widely accepted norms and values of society. Deliberation clarifies the problem, makes people aware of framing effects, and determines the limits of what could be called reasonable within the plurality of interpretations (Skillington 1997) . \u2022 Deliberations can also produce agreements. The minimal agreement may be a consensus about dissent (Raiffa 1994) . If all arguments are exchanged, participants know why they disagree. They may not be convinced that the arguments of the other side are true or morally strong enough to change their own position; but they understand the reasons why the opponents came to their conclusion. In the end, the deliberative process produces several consistent and -in their own domain -optimized positions that can be offered as package options to legal decision makers or the public. Once these options have been subjected to public discourse and debate, political bodies, such as agencies or parliaments can make the final selection in accordance with the legitimate rules and institutional arrangements such as majority vote or executive order. Final selections could also be performed by popular vote or referendum. \u2022 Deliberation may result in consensus. Often deliberative processes are used synonymously with consensus-seeking activities (Coglianese 1997 ). This is a major misunderstanding. Consensus is a possible outcome of deliberation, but not a mandatory requirement. If all participants find a new option that they all value more than the one option that they preferred when entering the deliberation, a \"true\" consensus is reached (Renn 1999) . It is clear that finding such a consensus is the exception rather than the rule. Consensus is either based on a win-win solution or a solution that serves the \"common good\" and each participant's interests and values better than any other solution. Less stringent is the requirement of a tolerated consensus. Such a consensus rests on the recognition that the selected decision option might serve the \"common good\" best, but on the expense of some interest violations or additional costs. In a tolerated consensus some participants voluntarily accept personal or group-specific losses in exchange for providing benefits to all of society. Case studies have provided sufficient evidence that deliberation has produced a tolerated consensus solution, particularly in siting conflicts (one example in Schneider et al. 1998) . Consensus and tolerated consensus should be distinguished from compromise. A compromise is a product of bargaining where each side gradually reduces its claim to the opposing party until they reach an agreement (Raiffa 1994) . All parties involved would rather choose the option that they preferred before starting deliberations, but since they cannot find a win-win situation or a morally superior alternative they look for a solution that they can \"live with\" knowing that it is the second or third best solution for them. Compromising on an issue relies on full representation of all vested interests.",

It helps the facilitator of such processes to focus on one element during the deliberation, to sort out the central from the peripheral elements, provide a consistent reference structure for ordering arguments and observations and to synthesize multiple impressions, observations and arguments into a coherent framework. The structuring power of decision analysis has often been used without expanding the analysis into quantitative modelling. b) The second potential, agenda setting and sequencing, is also frequently applied in participatory settings. It often makes sense to start with problem definition, then develop the criteria for evaluation, generate options, assess consequences of options, and so on. c) The third potential, quantifying consequences, probabilities and relative weights and calculating expected utilities, is more controversial than the other two. Whether the deliberative process should include a numerical analysis of utilities or engage the participants in a quantitative elicitation process is contested among participation practitioners . One side claims that quantifying helps participants to be more precise about their judgements and to be aware of the often painful trade-offs they are forced to make. In addition, quantification can make judgements more transparent to outside observers. The other side claims that quantification restricts the participants to the logic of numbers and reduces the complexity of argumentation into a mere trade-off game. Many philosophers argue that quantification supports the illusion that all values can be traded off against other values and that complex problems can be reduced to simple linear combinations of utilities. One possible compromise between the two camps may be to have participants go through the quantification exercise as a means to help them clarify their thoughts and preferences, but make the final decisions on the basis of holistic judgements (Renn 1986) . In this application of decision analytic procedures, the numerical results (i.e. for each option the sum over the utilities of each dimension multiplied by the weight of each dimension) of the decision process are not used as expression of the final judgement of the participant, but as a structuring aid to improve the participant's holistic, intuitive judgement. By pointing out potential discrepancies between the numerical model and the holistic judgements, the participants are forced to reflect upon their opinions and search for potential hidden motives or values that might explain the discrepancy.",

Other methods are to reach a consensus among the participants up front which expertise should be included in the deliberation or to appoint representatives of opposing science camps to explain their differences in public. In many cases, participants have strong reasons for questioning scientific orthodoxy and would like to have different science camps represented. Many stakeholders in environmental decisions have access to expert scientists, and often such scientists will take leading roles in criticizing agency science. Such discussions need to be managed so that disagreements among the scientific experts can be evaluated in terms of the validity of the evidence presented and the importance to the decision. It is essential in these situations to have a process in place that distinguishes between those evidence claims that all parties agree on, those where the factual base is shared but not its meaning for some quality criterion (such as \"healthy\" environment), and those where even the factual base is contested (Foster 2002) .",

The main conflicts occur at the process level (how should the negotiations be conducted?), on the cognitive level (what is factually correct?), the interest level (what benefits me?), the value level (what is needed for a \"good\" life?) and the normative level (what can I expect of all involved?). These different conflict levels are addressed in this subsection. First of all, negotiations begin by specifying the method that structures the dialogue and the rights and duties of all participants. It is the task of the chairman or organizer to present and justify the implicit rules of the talks and negotiations. Above and beyond this, the participants have to specify joint rules for decisions, the agenda, the role of the chairman, the order of hearings, etc. This should always be done according to the consensus principle. All partners in the negotiations have to be able to agree to the method. If no agreement is reached here the negotiations have to be interrupted or reorganized.",

            "text": "\u2022 In a first stage, the values and standards accepted by the participants are translated into criteria and then into indicators (measurement instructions). This translation needs the consensual agreement of all participants. Experts are asked to assess the available options with regard to each indicator according to the best of their knowledge (factual correctness). In this context it makes more sense to specify a joint methodological procedure or a consensus about the experts to be questioned than to give each group the freedom to have the indicators answered by their own experts. Often many potential consequences remain disputed as a result of this process, especially if they are uncertain. However, the bandwidth of possible opinions is more or less restricted depending on the level of certainty and clarity associated with the issue in question. Consensus on dissent is also of help here in separating contentious factual claims from undisputed ones and thus promotes further discussion. \u2022 In a second stage, all participating parties are required to interpret bandwidths of impacts to be expected for each criterion. Interpretation means linking factual statements with values and interests to form a balanced overall judgement (conflicts of interests and values). This judgement can and should be made separately for each indicator. In this way, each of the chains of causes for judgements can be understood better and criticized in the course of the negotiations. For example, the question of trustworthiness of the respective risk management agencies may play an important role in the interpretation of an expected risk value. Then it is the duty of the participating parties to scrutinize the previous performance of the authority concerned and propose institutional changes where appropriate. \u2022 Third stage: Even if there were a joint assessment and interpretation for every indicator, this would by no means signify that agreement is at hand. Much rather, the participants' different judgements about decisionmaking options may be a result of different value weightings for the indicators that are used as a basis for the values and standards. For example, a committed environmentalist may give much more weight to the indicator for conservation than to the indicator of efficiency. In the literature on game theory, this conflict is considered to be insoluble unless one of the participants can persuade the other to change his preference by means of compensation payments (for example, in the form of special benefits), transfer services (for example, in the form of a special service) or swap transactions (do, ut des). In reality, however, it can be seen that participants in negotiations are definitely open to the arguments of the other participants (i.e. they may renounce their first preference) if the loss of benefit is still tolerable for them and, at the same time, the proposed solution is considered to be \"conducive to the common good\", i.e. is seen as socially desirable in public perception. If no consensus is reached, a compromise solution can and should be reached, in which a 'fair' distribution of burdens and profits is accomplished. \u2022 Fourth stage: When weighing up options for action formal methods of balancing assessment can be used. Of these methods, the cost-benefit analysis and the multi-attribute or multi-criteria decision have proved their worth. The first method is largely based on the approach of revealed \"preferences\", i.e. on people's preferences shown in the past expressed in relative prices, the second on the approach of \"expressed preferences\", i.e. the explicit indication of relative weightings between the various cost and benefit dimensions (Fischhoff et al. 1982) . But both methods are only aids in weighing up and cannot replace an ethical reflection of the advantages and disadvantages.",

            "text": "Normative conflicts pose special problems because different evaluative criteria can always be classified as equally justifiable or unjustifiable as explained earlier. For this reason, most ethicists assume that different types and schools of ethical justification can claim parallel validity, it therefore remains up to the groups involved to choose the type of ethically legitimate justification that they want to use (Ropohl 1991 , Renn 1997 . Nevertheless, the limits of particular justifications are trespassed wherever primary principles accepted by all are infringed (such as human rights). Otherwise, standards should be classed as legitimate if they can be defended within the framework of ethical reasoning and if they do not contradict universal standards that are seen as binding for all. In this process conflicts can and will arise, e.g. that legitimate derivations of standards from the perspective of Group A contradict the equally legitimate derivations of Group B (Shrader-Frechette 1988). In order to reach a jointly supported selection of standards, either a portfolio of standards that can claim parallel validity should be drawn up or compensation solutions will have to be created in which one party compensates the other for giving up its legitimate options for action in favour of a common option. When choosing possible options for action or standards, options that infringe categorical principles, for example, to endangering the systematic ability of the natural environment to function for human use in the future and thus exceeding the limits of tolerability are not tolerable even if they imply major benefits to society. At the same time, all sub-dominant options have to be excluded. Frequently sub-dominant solutions, i.e. those that perform worse than all other options with regard to all criteria at least in the long term, are so attractive because they promise benefits in the short term although they entail losses in the long term, even if high interest rates are assumed. Often people or groups have no choice other than to choose the sub-dominant solution because all other options are closed to them due to a lack of resources. If large numbers of groups or many individuals act in this way, global risks become unmanageable (Beck 1996) . To avoid these risks intermediate financing or compensation by third parties should be considered.",

Organizing and structuring discourses goes beyond the good intention to have all relevant stakeholders involved in decision making. The mere desire to initiate a two-way communication process and the willingness to listen to stakeholder concerns are not sufficient. Discursive processes need a structure that assures the integration of technical expertise, regulatory requirements, and public values. These different inputs should be combined in such a fashion that they contribute to the deliberation process the type of expertise and knowledge that can claim legitimacy within a rational decision-making procedure (von Schomberg 1995). It does not make sense to replace technical expertise with vague public perceptions, nor is it justified to have the experts insert their own value judgements into what ought to be a democratic process.",

Decision analysis tools should be used with care. They do not provide an algorithm to reach an answer as to what is the best decision. Rather, decision analysis is a formal framework that can be used for environmental assessment and risk handling to explore difficult issues, to focus debate and further analysis on the factors most important to the decision, and to provide for increased transparency and more effective exchange of information and opinions among the process participants. The basic concepts are relatively simple and can be implemented with a minimum of mathematics (Hammond et al. 1999) . Many participation organizers have restricted the use of decision analytic tools to assist participants in structuring problems and ordering concerns and evaluations, and have refrained from going further into quantitative trade-off analysis. Others have advocated quantitative modelling as a clarification tool for making value conflicts more transparent to the participants.",

We believe that both the risk management agencies and the interested groups within the public that government agencies interact with on environmental decisions should all gain experience with these methods.
