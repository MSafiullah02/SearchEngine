Furthermore, the only study in our literature review that used both approaches (Chen et al., 2012) found that qPCR tended to produce inactivation estimates that were anywhere from 7 to 300 times lower than those produced using culture measurements.

First, it seems unlikely that free DNA from dead microbes would be readily available for qPCR amplification in anaerobic digesters. The digesters are designed to promote a high level of microbial metabolism, and free DNA would likely be degraded quickly because of its value as a substrate to support that metabolism. Second, culture methods are known to have their own limitation. Specifically, bacterial culture methods tend to underestimate numbers of live cells due to the phenomenon of the viable-but-nonculturable (VBNC) state (Roszak and Colwell, 1987) . Moreover, it is possible for numbers of culturable bacteria to decline with time in a given environment at a much faster rate than viable bacteria (Oliver, 2005) .

In this case, our own inactivation estimates should only be compared with those from previous studies that have also used qPCR (Narula et al., 2011; Slana et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012) . Among these, a typical exponential decay coefficient at mesophilic temperature appears to be ~0.2 d \u22121 (half-life = 3.5 d). Calculated with a 20-d residence time as before, this equates to log removal values of 0.70 for an ideal complete-mix digester and 1.7 for an ideal plug-flow digester. Given the large number of plug-flow digesters in our study (five of seven) and the similarity of the lower value for an ideal complete-mix digester to our own log removal values, we conclude that the digesters in our study are operating at a relatively inefficient level. This conclusion is supported by two further lines of evidence. First, the high degree of variability in microbe inactivation across both digester and season is itself indicative of poor digester performance. Second, the volatile solids destruction achieved by these digesters that was measured in the related study provides corroborating evidence for their generally poor performance. Volatile solids destruction in this related study was 30 \u00b1 14% when aggregated by season and digester (n = 21, mean \u00b1 SD).
