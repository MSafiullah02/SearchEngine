Adult lesser mealworms were buried in central North Carolina Cecil red clay at depths of 0, 8, 15, 23, and 30 cm and the beetles emerging from the soil counted 1, 3, 7, 10, 13, 17, 21, 24, and 28 d after burial. Beetles emerged from all depths and differences among depths were not signi\u00decant. Beetles survived at least 28 d buried in the soil at depths \u054530 cm. In seasonal \u00deeld studies, lesser mealworm emergence from clay soil with poultry litter incorporated by disk, mulch and plow was compared with emergence from plots with no incorporation. Incorporation signi\u00decantly reduced beetle emergence when poultry litter containing large numbers of beetles was applied to clay \u00deeld soils during the summer (F \u03ed 3.45; df \u03ed 3, 143; P \u03ed 0.018). Although mechanical incorporation of poultry litter reduced beetle emergence relative to the control, greatest reductions were seen in plowed treatments. Beetle activity was reduced after land application of litter during colder months. Generally, lesser mealworm emergence decreased with time and few beetles emerged from the soil 28 d after litter was applied. Similarly, mechanical incorporation of poultry litter into sandy soils reduced beetle emergence (F \u03ed 4.06; df \u03ed 3, 143; P \u03fd 0.008). In sandy soils typical of eastern North Carolina, disk and plow treatments signi\u00decantly reduced beetle emergence compared with control.",

High beetle densities are a concern to producers because of their potential to transmit avian disease agents. Lesser mealworms harbor the bacterial genera Escherichia, Salmonella, Bacillus, and Streptococcus as well as viruses that cause leukosis and infectious bursal disease in poultry (Despins et al. 1994; McAllister et al. 1994 McAllister et al. , 1995 McAllister et al. , 1996 Goodwin and Waltman 1996; Skov et al. 2004) . Recently, transmission of turkey coronavirus by lesser mealworms was demonstrated under laboratory conditions (Watson et al. 2000) . Broiler chicks and turkey poults readily consume lesser mealworm adults and larvae, which aids in the transmission of pathogenic organisms within the poultry house and negatively affects bird weight gains and feed conversion ef\u00deciency (Despins and Axtell 1995) .",

The North Carolina Department of Natural Resources requires that litter be applied to a growing crop or to a \u00deeld destined for planting within 30 d of litter application (Zublena et al. 2002) . Frequent litter removal reduces beetle populations within poultry houses but serves as a potential source of dispersal and reinfestation. Emigration of beetles to nearby homes and businesses may result in litigation and poor public relations (Hinchey 1997 , Miller 1997 . Although mechanical incorporation of poultry manure into soil reduces house \u00dfy survival (Watson et al. 1998) , the effect of this practice on lesser mealworm survival has not been investigated. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate survival of lesser mealworms buried in soil at different depths similar to those obtained with mechanical incorporation, monitor the emigration of lesser mealworms from litter applied to soil, and evaluate the impact of mechanical incorporation of the poultry litter into \u00deeld soil on beetle emergence in clay and sandy soils typical to central and eastern North Carolina poultry production areas.",

Pipes were cut to 13-, 20-, 28-, and 35-cm lengths, three pipes for each length. One end of each pipe was sealed with a polyvinyl chloride cap and pipe lengths were placed upright on the sealed end. Lightly packed Cecil red clay soil was added to each pipe to form a 2.5-cm soil base, and 60 cm 3 of turkey litter was added. Twenty adult lesser mealworms were placed on the litter layer in each length of pipe. Red clay soil was added to achieve the proposed burial depths of 8, 15, 23, and 30 cm. One pipe length received no additional soil (control). A moistened, crumpled paper towel (636 cm 2 ) was placed on the surface of the soil and the pipe was covered with mesh fabric secured with a rubber band. The paper towel was moistened with water as needed but no additional food was added. Pipes were held in a constant temperature chamber (25\u040aC, 75% RH) and a photoperiod of 18:6 (L:D) h. The beetles on the surface of the soil were collected and counted on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 13, 17, 21, 24, and 28, postburial. The experiment was replicated six times.

Beetles in the cylinder and pitfall traps were contained within the trap and were easily counted and removed. As the tile was lifted, all visible beetles were counted. Small stones or soil aggregates under the tile were lifted and all the beetles beneath were counted and removed. Beetles were counted and removed with forceps from the sticky traps.",

Preiss (1971) recorded adult beetle survival of 700 d under favorable conditions, suggesting great potential for reinfestation of poultry houses through walking or \u00dfight.

However, relatively few dead beetles were observed in spread litter and mortality was estimated at \u054530% of adult beetles. Using similar methods, Watson et al. (1998) land-applied fresh caged layer manure and observed 89% mortality of house \u00dfy larvae resulting from the \u00dfailing action of the manure spreader, a New Holland 305, 4,000-liter capacity, auger drive, and side delivery spreader (CNH Company, Lake Forest, IL). Although not directly measured in our study, several factors may have reduced beetle mortality. First, being hardy insects, the beetles were not stunned by the \u00dfailing action of the manure spreader. Second, the physical characteristics of litter and manure may affect postspreading mortality. The moisture and texture of turkey litter, a mixture of wood shavings and manure, was very different from the caged layer manure, a typically wet (80% moisture) and highly viscous material. Third, manure spreader designs also may affect mortality. One is a chain-driven rear delivery system with large paddles designed to throw the manure behind the spreader (John Deere 350). The second design (e.g., New Holland 305) has an auger screw in the bottom of the hopper that feeds the litter into a delivery unit that crushes clumped litter before it is thrown from the side. Speci\u00dec studies to examine manure spreader induced insect mortality have not been conducted. (Table 2 ). Mean number of beetles emerging from the soil after incorporation was greatest in the control plots, 6.47 \u03ee 1.12 for each observation. In contrast mean beetle emergence from disk, mulch tillage and moldboard plow were 3.52 \u03ee 0.68, 4.21 \u03ee 0.89, and 2.70 \u03ee 0.50, respectively. Trends in these data indicate the plow treatment had the greatest impact of the three methods of incorporation, regardless of season. Watson et al. (1998) had conducted a similar study focused on house \u00dfy survival after incorporation of manure into a gravel loam soil. In contrast to the current study, they found no signi\u00decant differences between treatments relative to the control. This in part may be explained by differences in soil type, Cecil red clay and a Howard gravel loam. Clay soils are easily compacted and retain moisture, whereas the gravel loam is porous and well drained, allowing for increased insect movement and survival.",

Disk, mulch, and plow treatments signi\u00decantly reduced beetle emergence from the soil relative to the control (F \u03ed 3.45; df \u03ed 3, 143; P \u0545 0.018) ( Table 2 ). The number of beetles emerging from the soil declined sharply 14 d postincorporation (Fig. 3B ). Between days 14 and 17, heavy rainfall saturated the treatment plots, apparently forcing buried beetles to the surface, resulting in increased beetle emergence days 17\u00d021. In the laboratory study simulating mechanical incorporation, beetles that did not emerge to the surface after 28 d were found alive in the soil at the conclusion of the study. Presumably, saturating the soil with water would have either trapped them below or driven these beetles to the surface. Treatment differences from the autumn experiment ( Fig. 4A) were inconsistent with those of the summer (Fig. 3B) . Mean beetle emergence from the control and disk treatments were similar, 0.36 \u03ee 0.16 and 0.33 \u03ee 0.19, respectively, and mean beetle emergence from the mulch treatment was 0 (F \u03ed 2.61; df \u03ed 3, 143; P \u0545 0.054), (Table 2) . Pairwise comparison of beetle emergence from disk, mulch and plow treatments were not signi\u00decant. There are two possible explanations: 1) as was observed in the spring experiment few beetles (21,374) were applied to the \u00deeld with the used poultry litter (Table 2) , and the percentage of beetles captured in the traps may have been too low to show signi\u00decant treatment effects; and 2) temperature effects may have obscured treatment effects. The autumn seasonal study was during a period of unusually cold weather. The average soil temperature 15 cm below the surface was 4\u040aC. Renault et al. (1999) reported that chill coma (a reversible condition in which cold temperature has severely reduced locomotion) occurred at 6\u040aC in adult lesser mealworm. Under these circumstances, the beetles would not have survived the cold buried 15 cm in the soil, although daily shifts in radiant heat in the control and shallower tillage disk treatments may have allowed some beetle survival.",

            "text": "We suspected that beetle emergence would differ from coastal plain sands of eastern North Carolina, which have physical characteristics unlike Cecil piedmont clay. Litter was applied to the eastern North Carolina \u00deeld during the summer when soil temperatures (15 cm in depth) were 26\u040aC. Approximately 82,100 beetles were applied to the \u00deeld before incorporation of the litter. Percentage of recovery of live beetles was greater than observed in clay soils (Table 2) . Sandy soils tended to collapse easily and we suspect the lack of soil structure facilitated beetles crawling to the surface. Regardless of perceived soil differences, trends observed on clay soils were consistent with sandy soils. As in clay soils, the mean number of beetles emerging from the sandy soil \u00deeld declined and little beetle activity was observed after 24 d (Fig. 5) . Mechanical incorporation of poultry litter signi\u00decantly reduced beetle emergence in sandy soil types (F \u03ed 4.06; df \u03ed 3, 143; P \u0545 0.008). Disk and plow treatments reduced emergence signi\u00decantly compared with control (Table 2) . Litter incorporation with a plow may be more effective in sandy soils as the sand settled completely after treatment and provides less surface structure (crevices) for harborage. The mulch tillage treatment was not signi\u00decantly different from the control in sandy soils. Presumably, the greater spacing between the tines of the mulch till implement did not completely turn the soil. Temperature and population density probably play a major role in beetle movement (Geden and Axtell 1987 , Rueda and Axtell 1996 , Renault et al. 1999 . Climbing and tunneling behavior within poultry houses seem to be density-dependent (Geden and Axtell 1987) . In their study, larval and adult activity increased during periods of darkness between 2000 and 2400 hours. Mass movement of beetles from \u00deeld applied poultry manure does occur occasionally, and the subsequent invasion of residences has resulted in litigation (Hinchey 1997 , Miller 1997 . We expected that disturbance of the litter during the removal process may induce \u00dfight and perhaps movement toward existing poultry houses. The presence of beetles on the sticky alsynite traps surrounding the \u00deeld in our study was indicative of beetle \u00dfight. We observed evidence of beetle \u00dfight during evenings of both summer studies but no \u00dfight during any other season. Beetle densities were 62,879 and 81,100 per \u00deeld during summer trials on clay and sandy soils, respectively. Soil temperatures were \u03f725 and 26\u040aC when \u00dfight was observed. Similar temperatures were observed in the spring, but beetle densities were lower (14,658), suggesting temperature and population density in\u00dfuences beetle movement.",

This study demonstrates that mechanical incorporation of poultry litter and/or application during cooler temperatures has a signi\u00decant impact on lesser meal-worm emergence and serves to reduce the potential for disease transmission and nuisance complaints. Two factors in\u00dfuence the utility of this practice. 1) Beetle emigration would likely occur, regardless of incorporation method, if beetle densities were greater than those used in this study. Efforts should be made to maintain relatively low beetle densities during the production cycle through a pest management program. 2) The legal requirement for applying litter to a growing crop or to \u00deelds planted within 30 d limits the practical application of litter during the cooler months as a beetle control strategy. Synchronized annual or semiannual litter applications near \u00derst or last frost dates, followed by incorporation may limit risks associated with beetle movement. ",
