In relation to this, many metals are able to perform futile one\u2010electron recycling between couples formed between appropriate valency states (Wiseman and Woods 2002). Furthermore, hydrogen radical abstractions can occur that can trigger a chain reaction in unsaturated phospholipids of oxidized membranes (both periplasmic membranes and those of cytoplasmic organelles) that releases breakdown products (when heated with FeII/ascorbate) such as malondialdehyde that are appropriate for bioassay by the thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) procedure (Halliwell and Gutteridge 1999).",

The essential role of oxygen gas, which has built up in the atmosphere as a result of the photosynthetic activity of green plants over a 3\u00b75\u2010billion\u2010year period is paramount in ROS production. The toxic nature of oxygen (Abele 2002), although essential for aerobic life on earth, has been subject to amelioration of toxicity through evolution of antioxidant enzymes that have developed over the last 250 million years. Moreover these antioxidant enzymes in the body, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, augment the role of dietary antioxidants such as vitamins E and C (Wiseman et al. 2000; Wiseman and Woods 2002).",

Where these introductions are associated with the biometabolism because of gut microflora of animals, dietary idiosyncrasy considerations are involved in the prediction of harmful outcomes. These predictions therefore need to be evaluated as part of the risk/benefit analysis associated with the necessary toxic hazard/risk recommendation by studies in silico and in real\u2010lab (in Petri). There is a major interest in the possibility that bioactive compounds in foods from agriculture, particularly those in plant and microbially fermented foods, can protect against a wide range of diseases (Wiseman 1998). Furthermore, bioactive compounds can have gender\u2010differentiated effects that are dependent also on a number of other factors including age, genomics and stage of reproductive development. Complacency may be the result of overconfidence in the prediction of \u2018nontoxicity\u2019, to bioprocess and to consumers, but failure to predict the likelihood of a disaster outcome with foodstuffs, has been manifest in the past. Examples include turkey X\u2010disease caused by aflatoxin (a hepatotoxin and carcinogen) in groundnuts contaminated in storage by Aspergillus flavus (late 1940s Africa; see 1, 2); Spanish cooking oil syndrome caused by contamination of cooking oil with aniline (1970s); syndromes caused by forms of organic mercury produced by micro\u2010organisms in waterways (1980s). Natural foodstuffs may also contain toxins (see 3, 4) and protectants (see 5, 6).",

In the latter case, supply of pyruvate allows a chemostat interpretation of growth kinetics, mediated by the CoA pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase\u2010catalysed cleavage of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate (this allows a subsequent production of ATP) plus carbon dioxide.

This is because of one\u2010electron reduction of each atom of oxygen, instead of two\u2010electron reduction to form water. Similarly, in many micro\u2010organisms the electron transfer chain from NADH to water (with insertion of one oxygen atom into xenobiotic substrates) that uses cytochromes P\u2010450 may display futile cycling, in the absence of substrate, to produce the superoxide anion (\u00b7O). Reduction of ROS, and also of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), is a priority for avoidance of production in particular microbial cultures susceptible to oxidative stress. For example, damage to biomolecules can occur by attack on phospholipid cytoplasmic and internal membranes, and also notably on DNA: and on the recombinant DNA of GM yeasts employed in manufacture of proteins such as insulin and interferon, intended for human therapy.",

Each of such redox couples displays an experimentally determined redox potential (reduction oxidation potential) of a particular voltage under standard (defined) conditions of temperature and pressure (usually 25\u00b0C, pH 7\u00b70, 1 atm). The standard redox potential scale (E) has good oxidizing agents (pro\u2010oxidants) such as molecular oxygen at the top with the high value of +0\u00b7815 V, and the reducing agents (antioxidants) at the bottom. For example, NADH is at \u22120\u00b7320 V (the scale passes through zero) and a voltage difference of 1\u00b7135 V therefore is associated with electron flow from NADH to O2 (in oxygen\u2010utilizing respiratory chains). This potential difference is normally sufficient to allow the production of a total of at least three ATP, each one at a particular step in the respiratory chain via known carriers by proton pumping through the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria. For instance, in interconversion of Fe(III) : Fe(II) the latter loses one electron during its oxidation to the FeIII (3+) form and thus these two forms of iron are pro\u2010oxidant (Fe3+) and antioxidant (Fe2+), respectively, but with the extra involvement of perferryl Fe5+ in the cytochrome P450 mechanism via [FeO]3+ the oxonium cation (Lewis 2001; Williams et al. 2003).",
