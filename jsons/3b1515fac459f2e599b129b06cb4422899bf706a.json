In this study, a novel iodine complex called CupriDyne\u00ae was assessed for its ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. CupriDyne was shown to be effective in inactivating the virus in a timedependent manner, reducing virus titers by 99% (2 logs) after 30 minutes, and reducing virus titers to below the detection limit after 60 minutes. The novel iodine complex tested herein offers a safe and gentle alternative to conventional disinfectants for use on indoor and outdoor surfaces.",

Other common disinfectants such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are also effective and widely available, but also have downsides such as flammability, rate of evaporation, and skin sensitivity (Stanford, 2020) .

While traditional Lugol's iodine or iodine tinctures (wherein elemental iodine is dissolved in water or alcohol, respectively) are effective yet cytotoxic disinfectants, povidone-iodine complexes provide effective disinfection without significant cytotoxicity due to the slow release of iodine from the polyvinylpyrrolidone with which iodine is complexed. However, povidone-iodine causes noticeable staining of skin and surfaces and commonly causes skin irritancy (WHO, 2008) , making it an unpopular hard surface disinfectant. Mechanistically, iodine is believed to react with and inactivate bacteria and viruses by oxidizing and/or iodinating critical proteins, DNA, RNA, and fatty acids (Gottardi, 1999; Gottardi, 2014) . Iodine-containing solutions have been proven effective against a wide variety of viruses including influenza A, poliovirus, adenovirus type 3, mumps, and HIV (Wada et al, 2016; Kawana et al, 1997) , with some indication of greater viricidal spectrum of activity compared to other commercially available disinfectants.",
