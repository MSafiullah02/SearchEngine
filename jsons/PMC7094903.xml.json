It is associated with conditions in which the respiratory drive is increased or the respiratory system is subject to an increased mechanical load [1], a condition usually seen in mechanically ventilated patients. Asynchrony and decreased breath-to-breath variability have been associated with increased mechanical load and respiratory drive [2, 3]. Moreover, in children, asynchrony during assisted ventilation is common [4\u20136]. As a result, the approach to ventilatory support in children is usually pressure targeted ventilation, since it allows gas delivery to vary based on patient demand [4].",

With NAVA, gas delivery is triggered, controlled and cycled by the diaphragmatic electromyogram signal (EAdi). The ventilator captures the change in the EAdi by a specially manufactured nasogastric tube equipped with ten electrodes. A number of studies in neonates and pediatric patients have demonstrated that patient ventilator synchrony is improved with the application of NAVA [4, 6], and studies in adults have shown that NAVA increases ventilatory variability compared to pressure support (PS) [9\u201311]. To maintain safety and patient comfort, large amounts of sedation are often necessary in ventilated PICU patients. To the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no studies directly examining the sedation needs of children being mechanically ventilated using NAVA compared to traditional ventilation modes.",

Major asynchronies were reported as the total number of asynchronous events (auto-triggered breaths, double triggering and non-triggered breaths) per minute and as an asynchrony index [AI = 100 \u00d7 number of major asynchrony events/(ventilator respiratory rate + non-triggered breaths)] [13].

Children had been on the same sedation and analgesia regime for at least 3 days before being admitted to the study. No changes in sedation or analgesia (Table 1) were made throughout the study. The following variables were used for data analysis: neurobreath (defined as a breath with a \u0394EAdi >1.5 \u03bcV for more than 150 ms); a breath\u2019s maximum EAdi (maxEAdi); a breath\u2019s initial baseline inspiratory EAdi (minEAdi); a breath\u2019s inspiratory pressure (P\nmax).

As shown by Corda et al.

We hypothesized that neural delay was due to intercostal muscle activity which generated inspiratory flow before diaphragmatic activation and that this was exaggerated in patient 12 (with recent median sternotomy) in order to stabilize his chest wall [23].",

We normalized these neural drive indices to the respective neural inspiratory drive variables, \u2206EAdinTi and EAdiTPnTi, EAdiTPTd and EAdiTPnTi, of a breath. These two indices take into account both the magnitude and the duration of neural stimulus and thereby provide a good picture of the intensity of the neural drive.

Additionally, as stated previously, a reduction of the asynchrony index can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay [13, 18]. Accordingly, our results indicate that through the decrease of ventilatory asynchrony and neural drive to trigger and the improvement of breath-to-breath mechanical variability, NAVA in children with asynchronies decreases psychological distress and may result in a notable reduction in the dose of sedative drugs, thereby potentially decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of PICU stay.",

The small number of patients and the case mix may not represent the global pediatric population. There is a high heterogeneity in terms of age and reason for mechanical ventilation. Patients were studied at different moments of their disease course (some in a more acute phase, others during recovery), which may have affected the \u201cpsychological distress\u201d (and so the COMFORT score) as well as mechanical results. Although sedation was maintained constant during the study for each patient, there were intra-patient variables beyond our control (sleep, hungry, secretions, mother\u2019s presence) that could have affected the homogeneity among phases. We did not measure esophageal pressure, so we cannot be sure about the minimal patient EAdi activity required to recruit diaphragmatic muscle units and distinguish true neural breaths from artifacts.",
