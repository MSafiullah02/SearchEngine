            "text": "Total joint replacement (TJR) is one of the most clinically successful interventions for patients with debilitating hip and knee diseases.1, 2 In recent decades, the procedural rates of total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) have increased worldwide,3 accounting for a large share of the total health care expenditure.4 Information regarding trends in TJR is required for optimal utilization of health resources and creation of an effective health care policy. Moreover, a large amount of the resources are being used for the training of surgeons and planning for hospital capacity; this creates the need for a reliable study for the estimation of TJR in future. Studies in Nordic countries,5 Australia,6 and the USA7 have reported trends in TJR using national registry data or health insurance databases. However, only a few of them have predicted the number of TJRs to be performed in the future.4, 8, 9 To our knowledge, no study of such prediction has been reported for Asian countries. Previous studies in Asian countries to understand the temporal trends of TJR did not estimate future TJR rates.10, 11, 12 Moreover, such studies did not consider revision TJR, and in those studies the time frame of analysis was limited to 4\u20139 years. Therefore, a study to understand the current and future trends in primary as well as revision TJR with data from recent years and longer periods would add to the useful information of health care planning. In this study, we investigated the trends in procedure frequency from 1998 to 2009 and estimated the requirements in the next two decades for THR and TKR in Taiwan.",

The rates were calculated by dividing the number of procedures by the corresponding resident population of Taiwan in that year. The primary and revision procedure rates were analyzed separately. Changes in the rates during the 12-year period (1998\u20132009) were evaluated. The frequency of the procedures was categorized by sex (male and female) and 10 age groups (<40 years, 40\u201344 years, 45\u201349 years, 50\u201354 years, 55\u201359 years, 60\u201364 years, 65\u201369 years, 70\u201374 years, 75\u201379 years, and \u226580 years). The number of THR and TKR procedures performed in a given year and for a particular age\u2013sex group was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, which is suitable for the distribution of such count data of TJR. A multivariate Poisson regression analysis with age, sex, calendar year, and their interactions as covariates was used to estimate the future procedure rate. For estimation of future rate, the future Taiwan population estimated by the Ministry of Interior was used. The estimation method used by the Ministry of Interior includes life expectancy and the current population growth rate. Moreover, a comparison of the rates in different age groups was performed using a univariate Poisson regression analysis, and temporal trend was examined using linear regression. The statistical analysis was performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.2 for Windows; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",

The study was conducted using the NHI Research Database for patients who underwent TJR of the knee or hip. This study indicated that the number and procedural rates of primary TKRs and THRs have increased in Taiwan. The increasing trend was more pronounced for TKR. The rate of primary TKR increased by around 99% between 1998 and 2009. The THR rate increased by only 11% during that period. The rate of revision TKR has increased by only 3% and that of the revision THR decreased by 13%.",

The smaller increase in the procedural rate shown in our study may suggest improved medical management of clinical conditions such as osteoarthritis. Similar studies in the USA,4, 9 Nordic countries,5 Australia,6 and South Korea12 showed a higher rate of primary TKR than that in Taiwan, in the respective study periods in those studies. Such differences in the procedural rate of TJR from Western countries may be due to differences in the incidence of obesity, sociocultural beliefs about surgery, work and exercise habits, hereditary characteristics, and socioeconomic status between Taiwan and the Western populations. Taiwan's population has an obesity rate of 17\u201318%; in Western countries it is 24\u201334%,17, 18 which may be a significant factor for differences in TJR rates between Taiwan and the Western population. Moreover, Taiwan NHI criteria for coverage of sponsored arthroplasty may also add to the difference in procedural rate.",

Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is among the major causes of THR in Taiwan.10 Similar to primary TKR, primary THR showed a lower rate compared with those in the USA, Nordic countries, and Australia, but higher than that in South Korea.

However, revision THR showed a decreasing trend with the progression of time, and the rate was higher in males.

The estimation in their study was higher than those in ours (1.3 times for primary TKR, 2.5 times for THR, 8.0 times for revision TKR, and 4.8 times for revision THR). In 2014, in another study by Kurtz et al,9 the increase in the primary THR rate was estimated to be higher than that in their earlier prediction. The lower estimated increase of rates in our study may be due to the same factors mentioned above as the reasons for lower primary TKR and THR, and also due to the difference in the statistical model used in our studies. However, in Taiwan, the projected rate of primary TKR is high, having a significant impact on health budgets and service provisions.",
