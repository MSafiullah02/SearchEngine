This outbreak was confirmed to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the same family of viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).1 The SARS epidemic in 2003 was controlled through numerous measures in China. One effective strategy was the establishment of fever clinics for triaging patients. Based on our first-hand experience in dealing with the present outbreak in Wuhan, we have established the following clinical strategies in adult fever clinics (figure\n).",

Therefore, in afebrile patients (temperature <37\u00b73\u00b0C) without dyspnoea, we recommend measurements of complete blood count and CRP. Subsequently, if the lymphocyte concentration is \u22651100/\u03bcL, home care with self-isolation is advised. Oral azithromycin or amoxicillin can be prescribed (measure 1, figure).",

Febrile patients (temperature \u226537\u00b73\u00b0C) should have both chest CT and respiratory viral tests. Patients with normal chest CT scans can follow measure 1 interventions.
