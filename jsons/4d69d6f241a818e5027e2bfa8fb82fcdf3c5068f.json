Symmetrically, this arbitrage argument shows that the more people who try to delay the infection before the peak, the lower the incentive to protect oneself during that time. The strategic substitutability of risk choices leads to a mixed equilibrium in which some fraction of the population arbitrages the infection timing by getting infected early. The rest best respond by doing nothing until the fraction infected is large enough, at which point everyone tries to reduce their risk until the peak of the epidemic passes.",

Getting infected at the peak of the epidemic then results in an expected death probability between 0.0467(1 \u2212 0.0245 \u00b7 0.51) = 0.046 and 0.3(1 \u2212 0.0245 \u00b7 0.21) = 0.298, which is the product of the probability of needing a ventilator and the probability of either not obtaining one or dying even with ventilation. The large upper bound 0.298 assumes severe cases become critical without medical intervention that is unavailable during the peak of the epidemic, and die after becoming critical. Catching the disease early when medical capacity is unconstrained results in an expected death probability 0.0467(1 \u2212 0.51) = 0.023 (Onder et al., 2020) . If expected utility is linear in the death probability, then the loss ratio 2 / 1 between being infected at the peak of the epidemic and initially is in the range [ 0.046 0.023 , 0.298 0.023 ], i.e., from 2 to 13.

Compared to the loss of dying with probability over 1.38% (Verity et al., 2020) , the cost of increasing or decreasing one's risk is likely small, in which case (3) is approximately r 2 2 > 1 and (2) is\u01ce 2 r 2 2 > 1 .

Trying to catch the disease early in an epidemic is individually rational if 0.4 2 / 1 \u2265 1, i.e., 2 \u2265 2.5 1 , which is at the lower end of the range [2, 13] of loss ratios.",

There is no closed form solution to the SIR model with bounded recovery times. Figure 1 shows a numerical example 4 in which deliberate early infection yields higher welfare.
