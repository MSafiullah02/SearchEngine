The need to target agents safely, efficiently, and selectively has become increasingly evident because of progress in vascular targeting. The vascular endothelium is a central target for intervention, given its multiple roles in the physiology (in health) and pathophysiology (in disease) and its direct accessibility to circulating ligands. In cancer, the expression of specific molecules on the surface of vascular endothelial and perivascular cells might enable direct therapeutic targeting. The use of in vivo phage display has significantly contributed to the identification of such targets, which have been successfully used for directed vascular targeting in preclinical animal models. Several animal studies have been performed by using fused molecules between tumor endothelium-directed molecules and immunomodulatory, procoagulant, or cytotoxic molecules. In addition to delivery of therapeutic agents, vascular targeted gene therapies based on both ligand-directed delivery of gene vectors to tumor endothelium and transcriptional targeting have also emerged. In this review, we discuss ligand-directed vascular targeting strategies with an emphasis on recent developments related to phagedisplay-based screenings.

Systemic cytotoxics do not target cancer cells selectively and lead to adverse effects because of a narrow therapeutic window. The development of targeted anticancer drugs, with improved discrimination between tumor cells and nonmalignant cells, is arguably one of the most important goals of current anticancer research. Most chemotherapeutic agents do not preferentially accumulate at the disease sites. Indeed, the dose that reaches the tumor (normalized per gram of tissue) may be as little as 5% -10% of the dose that accumulates in normal organs (Bosslet et al. 1998 ). High interstitial pressure and the irregular tumor vasculature may account, at least in part, for the poor drug uptake by tumor cells (Jain 1987 , Folli et al. 1993 . Moreover, the activity of multidrug resistance mechanisms may further decrease drug uptake (Bradley et al. 1988) . One avenue toward the development of more selective anticancer drugs consists of the targeted delivery of bioactive molecules (including, but not limited to, drugs, cytokines, procoagulant factors, photosensitizers, radionuclides, etc.) to the tumor environment by means of binding molecules specific for tumor-associated markers. The search for novel targets (cell surface receptors) and ligands is just as important as the development of strategies that convert a ligand (capable of selective homing to the tumor environment) into a therapeutic agent. Ligand-based tumor targeting approaches can enable ligand localization in the tumor microenvironment, with tumor-to-control organ ratios N10:1 reached only a few hours after intravenous administration (Buchegger et al. 1983 , Wu et al. 1996 , Adams 1998 , King et al. 1994 , Tarli et al. 1999 , Demartis et al. 2001 , Carnemolla et al. 2002 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 707, "end": 727, "text": "(Bosslet et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 865, "end": 875, "text": "(Jain 1987", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 876, "end": 895, "text": ", Folli et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 989, "end": 1010, "text": "(Bradley et al. 1988)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1249, "text": "(including, but not limited to, drugs, cytokines, procoagulant factors, photosensitizers, radionuclides, etc.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1790, "text": "(Buchegger et al. 1983", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1807, "text": ", Wu et al. 1996", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1820, "text": ", Adams 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1839, "text": ", King et al. 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1859, "text": ", Tarli et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1882, "text": ", Demartis et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1883, "end": 1907, "text": ", Carnemolla et al. 2002", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Several malignant, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and degenerative diseases are characterized by the onset of marked angiogenesis (Folkman 1995) . In cancer, it has long been proposed that angiogenesis contributes to tumor progression by promoting both primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination (Folkman 1971) . Tumor growth requires the formation of new blood vessels. This process of neovascularization, or angiogenesis, appears to be essential for solid tumors. Tumor endothelial cells are central in this neovascularization process. Tumor cells promote new blood vessel formation by releasing endothelial cell growth factors that support endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival. In solid tumors, the vasculature is an attractive target because the vascular endothelium is composed of genetically stable nontransformed cells that are presumably less adaptive than tumor cells and less likely to acquire drug resistance (St Croix et al. 2000 , Kolonin et al. 2001 , although this notion has been recently challenged (Hida and Klagsburn 2005) . In addition, endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels are directly accessible to drugs via the systemic circulation and express several cell surface markers that are absent or barely detectable in established or quiescent blood vessels. Ligand-directed vascular targeting can be accomplished by antibodies, specific peptides or growth factors complexed with immunomodulatory, procoagulant, or cytotoxic molecules (Thorpe and Burrows 1995 , Brekken and Thorpe 2001 , Thorpe et al. 2003 , Thorpe 2004 . Targeted molecules are selectively up-regulated on angiogenic tumor endothelial cells and include av integrins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, cell adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM] and E-selectin), and molecules associated with procoagulant changes on angiogenic endothelium such as phosphatidylserine Thorpe 2001, Brekken et al. 2002) . To identify specific targets on angiogenic tumor endothelium and to gather more information on their cellular distribution and location, phage display has been extensively used (Zurita et al. 2004) .

Another notable effector molecule is tissue factor (TF), which initiates the blood coagulation cascade. In the seminal work, the cell surface domain of TF was targeted to tumor blood vessels (Huang et al. 1997 ). This truncated extracellular domain of TF is soluble and five orders of magnitude less potent than the membrane form because the TF-factor VIIa complex requires negatively charged cell surface phospholipids to activate the downstream factors IX and X, which in turn catalyze the formation of thrombin (Ruf et al. 1991) . Soluble TF targeted to tumor vasculature initiates an explosive coagulation cascade that leads to intravascular thrombosis and tumor infarc-tion (Ran et al. 1998) . Targeting TF to tumor vessels has been accomplished with antibodies and peptides against tumor vasculature markers including major histocompatibility complex class II (Burrows and Thorpe 1993) . Dienst et al. (2005) have also evaluated a novel single-chain anti-VCAM-1 antibody/soluble TF fusion protein as a tumor vascular targeting agent. VCAM-1 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is generally not expressed by quiescent endothelium but is induced by inflammation. The tumor vasculature and some tumor cells generally express VCAM-1.

In this method, phage libraries are directly administered to mice into the tail vein, and tissues are collected and examined for phage bound to tissue-specific endothelial cell markers. Within a short circulation time (~5 min), the phage particles are unlikely to be able to leave the circulation; thus, after perfusion, only the phage population bound to the endothelium (vascular receptors) is recovered from the tissues. In vivo panning has the advantage that the isolated phage-displayed peptides home selectively to bintactQ targets of interest; moreover, these ligand peptides may be useful for the functional analysis of the corresponding receptors and potential identification of novel drug target candidates because some of the isolated peptides have been found to bind to endothelial receptors expressed in the vasculature of specific tissues. Although monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated clinical potentials as tumor-targeting agents, poor tumor penetration of the antibodies due to the size of molecules and liver/bone marrow toxicity by nonspecific uptake of the antibodies remain the two major limitations of antibody-based therapy (Shockley et al. 1991) . Peptidic targeting agents may ease the problems associated with antibody cancer therapy. Peptides obtained from in vivo phage display technology can exert anticancer effect by inhibiting angiogenesis, decreasing tumor metastasis activity, or inhibiting enzymes important for neoplastic cell spread. They can also be used themselves as targeting molecules of receptor-targeted toxins and gene therapy, imaging and/or therapeutic agents, and nanomedical devices. Thus, our approach provides a straightforward way to identify drug-accessible tumor cell surface receptors and to discover peptide ligands that can serve as mimetic prototype drugs. Unlike genomic or proteomic-based approaches that rely on differential expression levels of transcripts or protein products, this discovery platform directly addresses functional protein-protein interactions at the level of physical binding. In contrast to protein array systems, it is possible to select binding peptides even if the ligand-receptor interaction is mediated by conformational (rather than linear) epitopes.

The RGD-4C peptide has previously been identified as selectively binding av integrins and has been shown to home to the vasculature of tumor xenografts in nude mice. The tumor homing is possible because av integrins play an important role in angiogenesis: the avb3 and avb5 integrins are absent or expressed at low levels in normal endothelial cells but are induced in the angiogenic vasculature of tumors (Pasqualini et al. 1997 , Brooks et al. 1994a , b, Hammes et al. 1996 , Wickham et al. 1997 , Sipkins et al. 1998 , Hood et al. 2002 , Dickerson et al. 2004 ).

We reported that RGD-4C or the cyclic CNGRC conjugated to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin or to the proapoptotic peptide (KLA-KLAK)2 increases the therapeutic index and reduces toxicity in vivo , Ellerby et al. 1999 .

Several targeted nuclear imaging agents have been developed to report on highrisk features of atherosclerotic lesions (Mari and Strauss 2002) . Molecular changes on the endothelial surface are considered important contributors to the initiation, progression, and thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis (Ross 1993a , 1993b , Fuster 1994 .

Liu et al. (2003) , have used in vivo phage display technology for identification of peptide probes that selectively bind to atherosclerotic lesions induced in apoE knockout mice.

The rational design, construction, and testing of vasculartargeted gene delivery vectors is a promising route to improve the safety and efficacy of gene therapy. It would be highly advantageous if gene delivery to vascular cells could be improved in efficiency (thus enabling reduced doses to be used and potentially reduced immunogenicity) and improved selectivity (thus reducing potential deleterious side-effects of transgene expression at nontarget sites). Vector targeting strategies have advanced substantially in the recent past, enabling construction of vectors that can home to defined sites in vivo after systemic application. Adenovirus (Ad) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) are commonly used for cardiovascular gene therapy. The most commonly used Ad vectors for gene therapy are based on serotypes 2 and 5. In cardiovascular disease, adenoviruses can transduce the endothelium and smooth muscle cells within the blood vessel wall, albeit only upon administration of high titers (Lemarchand et al. 1993 , French et al. 1994 ). This has not hindered preclinical progression of Ad serotype 5 vectors to clinical trials for ischemia (Grines et al. 2002 , Hedman et al. 2003 . It would therefore be of benefit for cardiovascular gene therapy to develop adenoviruses with a more favorable profile. This can be achieved in several ways, including the use of anti-bodies to retarget the virus to alternative receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme or E-selectin (Harari et al. 1999 , Reynolds et al. 2000 , targeting peptides inserted into the HI loop of the fiber structure to modulate receptor binding (Nicklin et al. 2000 , molecular adaptors (Trepel et al. 2000a (Trepel et al. , 2000b , or by pseudotyping (involving the exchange of the Ad fiber for a fiber from an alternative serotype that possesses a more favorable cell binding profile (Chillon et al. 1999 , Havenga et al. 2001 .
