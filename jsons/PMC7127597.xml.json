Most of the communicable diseases are infections that are endemic to the tropics contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. The three major infections in the tropics are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Tropical medicine involves rare and exotic parasitic and bacterial diseases but in addition involves variety of noncommunicable diseases, such as vitamin deficiencies, snakebites, scorpion stings, and toxin-related cardiac and neurologic manifestations. Hence this field involves not just microbiology, virology, parasitology, and epidemiology but also a fair bit of internal medicine.",

His medical career spanned many decades in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (then called Formosa). He eventually came back to London where he lectured on tropical diseases at the St. George\u2019s hospital. He then became the chief medical officer to the Colonial Office. At this point he used his considerable influence to found a school for tropical medicine at the Albert Dock Seamen\u2019s Hospital. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was formally inaugurated on October 2, 1899. He eventually went on to become the first president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1907. He also made numerous contributions to parasitology, such as (1) the establishment of mosquito as the intermediate host of Wuchereria bancrofti, the causative agent of filariasis; (2) proposed the mosquito-malaria theory, which eventually spurred Sir Ronald Ross to discover that a mosquito was the definitive host for malaria; and (3) the discovery of a new species of Schistosoma (Schistosoma mansoni) and a new parasite, Spirometra or Sparganum mansoni and Spirometra mansonoides. A species of mosquito Mansonia spp and a filarial worm Mansonella spp were so named to honor him. He is hence known as the \u201cFather of Tropical medicine.\u201d",

Environmental factors include the following:\u2022Climate: Climate change has a wide-ranging impact on habitats, species distribution, human health, agriculture, sea levels, and the frequency/intensity of extreme weather events. Changing rainfall patterns and increased temperatures have also led to increase in vector borne diseases, such as dengue and malaria, because of increased vector distributions and decreased vector and parasite incubation periods.\u2022Air pollution: Among the tropical regions, Southeast Asia reported the greatest increase in CO2 emissions leading to a decreased air quality followed by South Asia and South America, which has significantly impacted the climate and led to higher weather-related mortality and morbidity, infectious disease rates, and respiratory illnesses.\u2022Land degradation: Although land productivity has gone up because of increased livestock and cereal production, land degradation caused by poor agricultural practices and deforestation has led to altered ecosystems and has not changed the fact that more people in the tropics experience undernourishment compared with the rest of the world.\u2022Water scarcity: The tropics have more than 54% of the world\u2019s renewable water sources, yet more than half of these areas are considered vulnerable to water stress because of the inequality of water distribution, with Southeast Asia having the highest pollution discharge in the world. Overexploitation of wild marine food resources has led to the coral reef systems to be at high or medium risk of damage.\u2022Biodiversity: Tropical biodiversity is being threatened across all taxonomic groups with a rapid loss of primary forests.

In the Global Burden of Disease Study9 diarrhea was a leading cause of death among all ages contributing to 1.31 million deaths. Most of the deaths in children and adults were attributable to Rotavirus, Shigella spp, and Salmonella spp. However, deaths on the whole have been reduced by 20.8% from 2005 to 2015. In the Global Enteric Multicenter Study10 done in children younger than age 5, interventions to reduce deaths should be directed against five pathogens: stable enterotoxigenic E coli, enteropathogenic E coli, Cryptosporidium spp, Rotavirus, and Shigella spp. Different clinical syndromes of diarrhea have been defined, each reflecting different etiology and pathogenesis. These are briefly described in Tables 5 and 6\n.",

In contrast in a low-prevalence, low-resource setting, additional tests may need to be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Subclinical and asymptomatic manifestations of a tropical disease may also make it difficult for a diagnostic test to distinguish between clinical disease and the former. In addition, if a test is serology-based in an endemic setting it may be difficult to establish causality for the clinical manifestations of the disease if baseline antibody titers is high.",

The advent of molecular techniques has made this a reality and the need of the hour is an accurate rapid diagnostic test. Today the high burden diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV infection, and malaria, all have rapid diagnostic tests, which has been a revolution with regard to appropriate case management of these diseases. A definite challenge has been to find similar easy diagnostic test strategies for diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance for other tropical infections associated with high morbidity and mortality.",

Azithromycin administration for treatment of trachoma.2.Intensified disease management: Improved case detection and decentralized clinical management of human African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and Buruli ulcer.3.Vector and intermediate host control: Integrated vector and intermediate host management uses efficient, ecologically sound, and sustainable interventions to control vector-borne and intermediate host-mediated neglected tropical diseases.4.Veterinary public health at the human animal interface: An integrated human and animal health approach is required for such diseases as cysticercosis, echinococcosis, and rabies, which involve vertebrate hosts.5.Provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene: Better sanitation and improved safe water supply coupled with vector control is being looked at for long-term economic growth and food production.\n",
