            "text": "Over recent years, the development of multiplex molecular biology techniques has enabled the rapid detection of respiratory viruses in many different contexts. Indeed, the rapid identification of respiratory pathogens has modified and improved the preventive and curative management of patients. It has been clearly shown that the rapid, accurate identification of respiratory specimens can have a significant impact on disease progression; this enables the introduction of appropriate therapy, decreases the unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents, and thus limits the risk of secondary infections in medical establishments [1]. These multiplex techniques have supplanted traditional methods for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections (such as cultures, direct fluorescent-antibody staining, and enzyme immunoassays) and are superior in terms of sensitivity, execution time and turn-around time [2]. Lastly, multiplex molecular biology techniques can also be rapidly adapted to detect new or emerging viruses. Although the reagent cost is inherently higher, many studies have clearly demonstrated that appropriately prescribed respiratory multiplex assays are cost-effective and can generate significant savings for hospitals [[3], [4], [5]].",

However, the picornaviruses (EVs/hRVs) were most frequent in all age groups. The distribution did not vary greatly with age. In children under 1 month and in those aged between 1 and 24 months, the second and third most frequently detected viruses were hRSV and PIVs, respectively. This ranking differed in children aged over 24 months, where Inf viruses were most frequent and hRSV was the second most frequent type. The high frequency of hRSV infection in infants under the age of 6 months of age has been clearly documented in several studies [18]. Our present results confirm the importance of screening for hRSV in very young children. However, the high proportion of picornaviruses isolated alone or as co-infection in symptomatic children raises the question of their true pathogenicity; further studies are therefore required.",
