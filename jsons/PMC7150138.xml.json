Most effective of these are the mechanical barriers provided by the skin and mucosal surfaces, as well as the chemically hostile environment of the gut (Fig. 27.1\n). A number of common human viral pathogens enter through the gastrointestinal tract, including rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, and hepatitis A virus (HAV). These are usually spread via person-to-person contact or contaminated food and water. Respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are often spread by aerosol transmission, as well as person-to-person contact. Many of the herpes viruses target the skin or the mucosae, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV. HSV in particular can infect oral and genital mucosa, the eye, and the skin through small cuts and abrasions. Other herpes viruses, such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), target the mucosa. CMV can also spread vertically from mother to baby or rarely via blood transfusions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) targets skin and mucosa and causes warts and may transform cells, inducing cancers such as cervical cancer. Viruses such as West Nile virus, Dengue virus and Semliki forest virus may also enter through the skin via insect vectors. HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly spread via sexual contact. HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can also infect humans via direct entry into the bloodstream via transfusions or contaminated needles.",

            "text": "Most human viruses replicate only in certain target tissues, this being mainly the consequence of viral receptor distribution. Many viruses use two receptors, such as the use of the CD4 co-receptor and the chemokine receptor CCR5 by HIV. After attachment to a cellular receptor, viruses may fuse with the cell membrane or be endocytosed and then gain entry into the cytoplasm or nucleus by fusing with the vesicular membrane (enveloped viruses such as HSV and HIV), or translocate across the cell membrane or induce lysis of the endocytic vesicle once in the cytoplasm (nonenveloped viruses such as Norwalk virus and poliovirus).1 Viruses then utilize host cell machinery and specialized virally encoded proteins to replicate rapidly within the cell. Once they have multiplied within the cell, many viruses induce cytolysis in order to facilitate release of new infectious virions (the poxviruses, poliovirus, and herpes viruses, for example). Other viruses are released from infected cells by budding through the cell membrane in the absence of cell death (e.g., HIV and influenza virus). Having entered the body, however, viruses encounter numerous innate defenses and activate the components of adaptive immunity. The latter usually assures that clinical disease, if not infection, will not become evident. Successful exploitation of these defenses through the use of vaccines remains a central challenge for many human viruses, particularly those that cause chronic infections such as HIV and HCV.2\n",

Innate defenses come into play to block or inhibit initial infection, to protect cells from infection, or to eliminate virus-infected cells; these occur well before the effectors of adaptive immunity become active (Chapter 3). The innate immune defenses are initiated via pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These include transmembrane receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, two families of intracellular receptors including the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and the RIG-I-like helicases (RLHs), as well as the sensor molecule absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) (Table 27.2\n). These cellular sensors promote the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18, type I (\u03b1/\u03b2) interferons (IFN-I) and a variety of IFN-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines. TLRs are cell surface or endosomal membrane-bound proteins expressed by numerous cells including dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, lymphocytes, and parenchymal cells. Expression of TLRs is largely inducible in most cell types, though some (TLR7/8/9) are constitutively expressed at high levels by specialized plasmacytoid DC for rapid IFN production. Different TLR molecules recognize specific viral products such as single- and double-stranded RNA (TLR 3 and TLR7/8, respectively) or double-stranded DNA (TLR9). Much of our understanding of the roles of TLRs to antiviral defense have been discovered in mice, yet our understanding of the similarities and differences in the functions of human TLRs is rapidly improving.3\n",

The longest known and best studied antiviral proteins are the \u03b1/\u03b2 IFNs, which act by binding to the type I IFN receptor and result in the transcription of more than 100 IFN-stimulated genes. One consequence of this \u201cantiviral state\u201d is the inhibition of cell protein synthesis and the prevention of viral replication.7 Type I IFNs also activate natural killer (NK) cells and induce other cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 that promote NK responses (Chapter 17). NK cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, they can kill infected cells and interact with DC, and are an important component of innate defense against viruses. NK cells are regulated by an array of activating and inhibitory receptors whose expression and function are just beginning to be understood. Uninfected cells are usually protected from NK cell cytolysis as they deliver negative signals such as high expression of MHC molecules. In contrast, virus-infected cells are killed either because they deliver positive signals or because they lack adequate MHC-negative signals. The NK defense system appears important against some herpes viruses, which downregulate MHC expression in the cells they infect. NK cells are also important in resistance to mouse and human cytomegalovirus, and possibly to HIV, influenza virus, and Ebola viruses.8 A distinct NK cell population, NKT cells, may provide some antigen-specific innate immune protection against certain viruses.9 Many other leukocytes are involved in innate defense, including macrophages, DC, neutrophils, and perhaps T cells expressing \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell receptors for antigen. Furthermore, tissue cells including fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells express PRRs and can respond to viral infection via the production of innate cytokines, including IFN-I and IL-1.",

These include natural antibody, which may play a role in defense against some virus infections, as well as the pentraxins and complement proteins.10 Some viruses may be directly inactivated by complement activation or be destroyed by phagocytic cells that bind and ingest complement-bound virions. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by virus infection also play key roles in defense. Foremost among these is IL-1 and other members of the IL-1 family, including IL-18 and IL-33.11 These cytokines influence both innate and adaptive immune cells and play critical roles in antiviral defense. Other anti-viral cytokines are produced early following infection, such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, IL-6, and chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1. In particular, IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 from NK cells. Inflammatory chemokines may also play an important role in innate antiviral defense by orchestrating macrophage, neutrophil, DC, and NK responses at the site of infection (Chapter 10). Not only are these components of innate immunity involved in mediating initial protection against viruses; several components (such as the PRRs, the cytokines IFN-I, IL-I, and IL-12, and phagocytes including macrophages, monocytes, and DC) serve to shape the nature and effectiveness of the subsequent adaptive response to viral pathogens.",

Antibodies usually function by binding to free viral particles, and in so doing block infection of the host cell. In contrast, T cells act principally by recognizing and destroying virus-infected cells, or by orchestrating an inflammatory response that includes several antiviral components. As all viruses replicate within cells and many can spread directly between cells without re-entering the extracellular environment, resolution of infection is reliant more on T-cell function than on antibody. Antiviral antibody, however, does assume considerably more importance as an additional immunoprotective barrier against reinfection. It is the presence of antibody at portals of entry\u2014most often mucosal surfaces\u2014that is of particular relevance to influenza, HSV, and HIV infections.12 Accordingly, vaccinologists try to design vaccines that optimally induce mucosal antibody.",

Specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors recognize antigen in the context of MHC class I\u2013peptide antigen complexes on professional APC, such as DC. The CD8 T cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into effectors. Expansion of these na\u00efve antigen-specific precursors is considerable, often exceeding 10,000-fold, and results in an effector population that can account for 40% or more of a host's total CD8 T-cell population (Fig. 27.2\n). Various factors, including antigen and APC, co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD28 and 4-1BB), and inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-I and IL-12) are required to program the development of functional effector lymphocytes.17 The CTL effectors enter the efferent lymph and bloodstream and access almost all body locations, including both primary and subsequent sites of infection. However, effectors do not stay activated for long once the virus is cleared, and approximately 95% die by a process termed activation-induced cell death. Following this contraction phase, the remaining cells differentiate into memory cells, which remain as a more or less stable population in the host for many years. They represent an expanded pool of CTL precursors that can be activated upon secondary encounter with antigen, and provide enhanced protection upon reinfection with the same virus (see next section). Though much of our knowledge of T-cell responses to viruses have been obtained using mice, recent work has demonstrated that most of the fundamental principles (described below) are the same or similar in humans.18\n",

The differentiation of CD4 T cells into effectors occurs in a manner very similar to that with CD8 T cells. At present less is known about the size and specificity of CD4 T-cell responses, but effector CD4 T-cell populations appear to consist of a broader epitope specificity than CD8 T cells responding to a given virus. CD4 T cells are activated by recognizing viral peptides associated with class II MHC molecules, which are present on more specialized cells such as APC.

More commonly, however, effector CD4 T cells act by synthesizing and releasing numerous cytokines following their reaction with antigen (Chapter 9). Subsets of CD4 T effectors produce different groups of cytokines. The type most often involved in antiviral defense are designated T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, and primarily produce IFN-\u03b3, LT\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 to help orchestrate the inflammatory response and act directly or indirectly in antiviral defense. Conversely, Th2 effectors produce an array of cytokines that may downregulate the protective function of Th1 cells, such as IL-4, IL-5, and two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Th2 T cells play a protective function against some parasite infections (Chapter 29), though in some virus infections an exuberant Th2 response may be associated with immunopathology or impaired immunity. Indeed, blocking the Th2 cytokine IL-10 was recently shown to assist in the clearance of chronic viral infection. Th17 cells that produce IL-17, and also IL-22, are generated under certain inflammatory conditions, though it is unclear whether these cells play a vital role during viral infections.22 Lastly, CD4 T cells can differentiate into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells following interactions with antigen-specific B cells, which are important for germinal center formation and antibody responses to viruses.23\n",

Humoral memory to viruses involves long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow that provide a continuous low-level source of serum antibody. This maintenance of humoral immunity also involves a population of homeostatically maintained memory B cells, which may be required to maintain stable numbers of long-lived plasma cells over time. The pool of memory T cells is regulated by low-level homeostatic division controlled by the cytokines IL-7 and -15.

However, these viruses generally remain undetectable in immunocompetant individuals. Other viral infections, such as those caused by the herpes viruses HSV and VZV, are marked by periods of latency, where no virus can be detected.

Such viral infections are marked by high levels of persisting antigen and can result in skewed T-cell immunodominance hierarchies, altered tissue localization of immune cells, and severely impaired T-cell function.33 This altered T-cell function is hierarchical and results in functional T-cell defects ranging from reduced cytokine production and altered proliferative capacity (exhaustion) to death (deletion) of the responding T cells (Fig. 27.4\n). Recent work has shown that viral antigen levels are responsible for this immune dysfunction.35 This is in stark contrast to normal memory T-cell development, which occurs in the absence of persisting antigen (see previous section). Recent studies have demonstrated that signaling through the cell-surface receptor programmed death (PD)-1 on effector CTL causes exhaustion during chronic infections.36 This pathway may be essential for preventing excessive immunopathology by effector T cells, yet appears to contribute directly to failed immunity to HIV infection, and other chronic human viral infections. These studies implicate this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",

The first virus-induced immunopathological lesion recognized was glomerulonephritis and arteritis, noted in mice persistently infected with LCMV. The lesions were assumed to represent inflammatory reactions to tissue-entrapped immune complexes that activate complement. Similar immune complex-mediated lesions occur in other infections, which include lung lesions found in severe influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as viral hepatitis and arthritis.39 However, only rarely have viral antigens been shown to contribute to the antigen component of the complex. An example where the inclusion of viral antigen in immune complexes has been demonstrated is chronic hepatitis B virus infection of humans. Autoimmune disease such as SLE also results from immune complex-mediated tissue damage. However, evidence linking viruses to the etiology or pathogenesis of SLE is scarce, since the immune complexes in SLE do not appear at any stage to include viral antigens.",

In LCMV damage occurs in the leptomeninges of immunocompetent mice infected intracerebrally. Hepatitis can also occur in mice infected intravenously. Neither lesion becomes evident if the CD8 T-cell response is suppressed. CD8 T-cell-mediated immunopathology is a causative mechanism of chronic hepatitis associated with hepatitis C and B infection as well as with some lesions that occur during HIV infection.40 The immunopathological mechanisms involved in hepatitis B infection have been carefully analyzed in a mouse model in which the whole HBV was expressed as a transgene. In this model, CD8 T cells orchestrated the immunopathology, but the process was complex. Initially, CTL-mediated killing events occurred, but since hepatocytes die by apoptosis it was not clear how this related to subsequent inflammatory events. However, the CD8 T cells also released numerous cytokines and chemokines that recruited inflammatory cells, primarily macrophages. Interestingly, liver-infiltrating CTL have been shown to be inhibited by PD-1\u2013PD-L1 interactions, which may greatly reduce the severity of local immunopathology. Additional viral immunopathology models where lesions result primarily from CD8 T-cell involvement include myocarditis and insulin-dependent diabetes associated with coxsackie B virus infection. In both instances, CD8 T cells mainly orchestrate events, but tissue damage may result from the bystander effects of cytokines and other molecules such as lipid mediators, metalloproteinases, and components of the oxygen burst. Although coxsackie virus can be a cause of diabetes in the mouse, attempts to relate viral infection directly to the etiology of human diabetes have so far failed.38\nClinical RelevanceHypothesized role of viruses in autoimmunity\n\u25aaMolecular mimicry: similar epitopes shared by virus and host\u25aaBystander activation: chronic release of cytokines and host antigens activates local autoreactive lymphocytes\u25aaViral persistence: chronic viral antigen presentation on host cells leads to prolonged immunopathology\n\n",

In both situations, CD4 T cells that produce Th1 cytokines appear to serve as the pathologic mediators. Furthermore, in both models an increase in the involvement of myelin-derived autoantigens occurs as the disease progresses. Once again, such observations indicate the possible role of a virus in an autoimmune disease. With the Theiler's virus model the virus persists in the nervous system and chronically stimulates CD4 T cells to secrete an array of cytokines. The demyelinating events appear to result from cytokine action on oligodendrocytes. Myelin components such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein may be released and participate as additional antigens in immunoinflammatory events.

These Tregs can also influence that magnitude of the protective immune response to viruses.43 Natural FoxP3+ Tregs, or other types of regulatory T cells that produce an abundance of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, are known to be involved in limiting excessive immunopathology associated with ongoing immune responses to persistent viral infection. Evidence for this has been reported in several viral infections, including HCV, HIV, and influenza virus.43 It is interesting to note that Treg function may be both beneficial to the host, by limiting immunopathology, and detrimental, due to reduced local T-cell responses and thus prolonged viral persistence.Key ConceptsPhases of immunity affected by regulatory T cells (Tregs)\n\u25aaInterference with antigen presentation by dendritic cells\u25aaInhibition of T-cell proliferation\u25aaInhibition of molecules involved in tissue-specific migration of effector cells\u25aaInhibition of T-cell effector functions in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues\n\n",

In the near future this should also assist in the formulation of new vaccines containing key immune activators, such as those that stimulate certain subsets of T cells, or induce appropriate homing molecule expression on these cells to direct them to tissues where they are required to mediate protection (such as mucosal sites, or the skin).On the HorizonClinically needed research opportunities\n\u25aaOvercoming immune dysfunction during chronic viral infections essential for successful viral clearance.\u25aaImproving the efficacy of vaccines to viruses using systems biology approaches.\u25aaTherapies for reducing immunopathology during viral infections.\n\n",

            "text": "In some individuals viral infections cause mild, or sometimes debilitating, tissue damage. Factors that influence whether a viral infection results in immunopathology varies from individual to individual. These factors include age, the route of infection, pre-existing immunity, host genetics and the host's viral burden or virome. Our knowledge of the influence of these factors on the outcome of viral infection is expected to improve rapidly in the coming decade. Recent advances have shed considerable light on the various pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators produced during viral infections. These represent key targets for novel therapies in the near future via the use of small-molecule inhibitors or treatment with endogenous chemical mediators such as resolvins or protectins.",

However, certain viruses, particularly in cases where the host's immune system is impaired, can cause significant damage to the host's tissues. As our understanding of the mechanisms underlying innate immune defenses, antigen presentation, T- and B-cell responses, and Tregs continues to improve, so too does the ability to design better vaccines and therapies to boost the immune control of viral infections. Although this remains a challenging goal, particularly for many human viruses such as HIV, HCV, and HSV, these rapid advances continue to provide many avenues for further investigation.",
