The increase was not evident after 7 days of the common cold, and no differences between the FT and CC groups could be noticed. Therefore, the salivary IgA response was probably induced by the viruses, and the treatment of the common cold with fluticasone propionate did not have any negative influence on this defense factor. Although the common cold was followed by a significantly enhanced mucosal IgA response, it is not clear whether this effect is clinically important. IgA is one of the major factors eliminating (eg, by aggregation) bacteria and viruses from mucosal surfaces,23, 24 and this effect is therefore likely to be important in vivo.4, 5 However, further studies of the actual microbial changes are needed to elucidate the real biologic significance of our observations.",
