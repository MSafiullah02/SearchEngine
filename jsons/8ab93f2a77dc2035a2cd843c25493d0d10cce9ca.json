            "text": "The traffic among the cellular compartments is thought to be mediated by membrane vesicles which bud from one compartment and fuse with the next (Palade, 1975) . Despite the continuous exchange of membrane components among them, the organelles maintain their characteristic protein and lipid compositions so that the traffic remains selective, thus avoiding intermixing of components. Membrane must also be recycled backward to compensate for loss of membrane in the forward movement. Membrane recycling at the cell surface has been especially studied and it is now thought that the cell membrane of all animal cells is being continuously and rapidly endocytosed (Silverstein et al., 1977) . This membrane traffic recycles components from the cell surface to the interior of the cell and back to the cell surface again (Anderson and Kaplan, 1983) . Some of the surface membrane components are channeled at least in part to the lysosome to be degraded. In some cells with considerable secretory activity, recycling of surface components back to the Golgi complex has also been detected (Farquhar and Palade, 1981) . The membrane traffic between the ER and the cell surface involves a major sorting problem (Rothman, 1981) . Little is known of how the animal cell has solved this problem in molecular terms. Such processes are exceedingly difficult to study in the cell in which a multitude of proteins is synthesized simultaneously with a sizable proportion of them initially routed into the ER. In vitro systems have been developed to study the first phase of assembly into the ER during protein synthesis (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975a,b) . Attempts to reconstruct other phases in the transport of proteins from the ER to other organelles have begun (Fries and Rothman, 1980) but are still in their infancy. Other simplifications are obviously needed to make possible studies of these processes at the molecular level.",

Such viruses include influenza virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). They are extremely simple in makeup and hence are very well characterized. They can be tagged with biochemical probes in many different ways. They infect many animal cells in culture, and after infection turn the cells into factories for the production of virus progeny. The protein-synthesizing machinery of the host cell is programmed by the viral RNA to make viral proteins exclusively and these include the viral surface glycoproteins. These are synthesized with signal peptides and inserted into the ER membrane Bonatti f t al., 1979) , from which they are transported to the cell surface via the Golgi complex (Bergmann et al., 1981; Green et al., 1981) . The net effect is the same as if the cell were to divert most of its protein-synthesizing capacity to the making of only one or two of its own plasma membrane glycoproteins. This amplification is the key to the use of viral glycoproteins as probes for membrane traffic from the ER. The endocytic route from the cell surface can also be studied with enveloped viruses, because this is the route they use to infect the cell .",

For more information on the biology of these viruses see the monograph on togaviruses (Schlesinger, 1980) .

Together with the capsid protein which has a molecular weight of 29,700 (Garoff et al., 1980a ; Rice and Strauss, 1981) it forms the nucleocapsid which is encapsulated by the viral envelope, a lipid bilayer studded with spikes of viral glycoproteins.

It can also be purified from extracts of infected cells. The weight of the SFV nucleocapsid, recently determined by neutron scattering analysis, is 9.46 X lo6 daltons of which the RNA accounts for 4.1 x lo6 daltons (Jacrot et al., 1983) . This leaves 5.36 x lo6 daltons for the capsid proteins, which is exactly the value calculated for 180 protein subunits each having a molecular weight of 29.7 X 10'. These values are in good agreement with the RNA percentage (42%) determined by chemical analysis (Jacrot el al., 1983) . The diameter of the nucleocapsid in the virus particle has been determined by low-angle X-ray scattering (Harrison et al., 1971 ; S. C. Harrison and L. Kaariainen, unpublished data) . The diameters of the Sindbis virus and SFV nucleocapsid are 400 and 380 8,, respectively. Recent neutron scattering values give a slightly larger value of 410 8, for the diameter of the isolated SFV nucleocapsid (Jacrot et al., 1983) . The surface structure of the nucleocapsid appears to be icosahedral. Although the exact organization of the capsid proteins in the nucleocapsid is not yet clear (see Murphy, 1980) , the composition is compatible with T = 3 icosahedral symmetry. The difficulty in determining the surface lattice of the capsid protein is probably due to the organization of the protein within the nucleocapsid. Neutron diffraction studies suggest that the proteins do not form a shell around the RNA (Jacrot et al., 1983) . Instead, the proteins and the RNA appear to be rather uniformly distributed within the particle and this might make the protein subunits rather difficult to visualize in electron micrographs.",

Their amino acid sequences have been established both by conventional methods and by DNA sequencing (Fig. 1) . The capsid proteins from both viruses contain a striking cluster of lysine, arginine, and proline residues in the amino-terminal third of the polypeptide chain. A number of nucleocapsid proteins from other viruses have similar base sequences and this region is probably involved in the interaction of the protein with the RNA (e.g., Fiers et al., 1978; Shinnik et al., 1981; Kitamura et al., 1981) . However, there is less sequence homology in this part of the molecule between the two viruses than in the carboxyl-terminal part of the proteins (residues 166-267) where 76% of the residues are identical and another 6% are conservative substitutions. This carboxylterminal region is probably important for other critical functions of the protein such as those protein-protein interactions that stabilize the nucleocapsid structure and those that are formed between the spike proteins and the capsid proteins during viral budding. Serine-219 in the SFV capsid protein is part of a sequence (Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly) characteristic of serine proteases (Boege et al., 1981) . The same sequence is found in an analogous position in the Sindbis virus capsid protein. This might be part of the catalytic site of the putative autoprotease activity of the capsid protein (see Section III,B, 1). The amino-terminal methionine is acetylated in the Sindbis virus capsid protein (Bell and Strauss, 1981) and in SFV it is also blocked (Kalkkinen et al., 1980) . Such blocks are fairly common in the structural proteins of viruses and might protect them against proteolytic degradation by cellular exopeptidases (Jornvall, 1975 ). *   TAC ACG CAT GAG AAG CCC GAG GGA CAC TAT PAC TGG CAC CAC GGG GCT GTT CAG TAC AGC GGA GGT AGG TTC ",

However, if antibodies to either the E l or the E2 proteins are added, the polypeptide chains dissociate from each other. This separation can also be observed when deoxycholate is used to solubilize the spike glycoproteins (Helenius et al., 1976) . If the virus is treated with proteolytic enzymes the fuzzy layer formed by the viral spikes is removed (Osterrieth, 1965; Compans, 1971; Gahmberg el al., 1972; Sefton and Gaffney, 1974; Utermann and Simons, 1974) . Remnants of both El and E2 are left in the bilayer. These have a hydrophobic amino acid composition, and are soluble in lipid solvents such as chloroform-methanol. The amphiphilic nature of the spike protein is also evident from its capacity to bind Triton X-100 (0.6 g/g protein) which binds to the hydrophobic part to form a water-soluble protein-detergent complex (Simons et al., 1973a) . The ability of amphiphilic proteins to bind Triton can be used to separate them from hydrophilic proteins using an extraction procedure recently described by Bordier (1 98 1) . The virus membrane is solubilized with Triton X-1 14, another detergent of the octylphenolpolyoxyethyIene series, and hydrophilic proteins are separated from the amphiphilic ones simply by raising the temperature to 30\u00b0C. At this temperature, Triton X-114 separates into a detergent phase containing the viral spike glycoproteins leaving the viral nucleocapsids in the aqueous phase (G. Warren, unpublished observations) .",

When the virus is labeled from the outside and from both sides with f~rmyl[~~S]rnethionyl sulfone methyl phosphate, one additional basic peptide derived from the E2 chain can be labeled . This is assumed to be derived from the internal domain of the E2 chain. This internal domain can be demonstrated more directly in vesicles derived from ER membrane after assembly of the viral glycoprotein in the infected cell. These vesicles are \"inside out\" when compared to the viral particle. Protease digestion of such vesicles removes about 25-30 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal region of the E2 chain (Garoff and Soderlund, 1978) . No comparable evidence has been obtained for the E l chain. Another approach using the cross-linker dimethyl suberimidate, which cross-links reactive groups that are about 1 1 A apart, shows that the spike glycoproteins in the SFV can be cross-linked to the underlying nucleocapsid probably by links between the internal domain of the E2 chain and the capsid protein . However, it has not been possible to isolate glycoprotein-capsid oligomers, mainly because the basic capsid proteins prefer to cross-link with each other forming large polymers that do not penetrate into polyacrylamide gels Richardson and Vance, 1978a) . But nucleocapsids cross-linked to glycoproteins can be isolated by density gradient centrifugation after detergent treatment. These contain up to 65% of the spike proteins in the original viral particle. With Sindbis virus, bifunctional amino-reactive reagents have not led to cross-linking of the spike proteins with the nucleocapsid . However, treatment of the virus with formaldehyde results in such cross-links, suggesting that similar interactions also exist in Sindbis virus (Brown et aL, 1974) . More evidence that the spike proteins are attached to the nucleocapsid can be obtained using mild detergents that solubilize the lipids from the viral particles but leave most of the spike proteins still attached to the nucleocapsid . When SFV is treated with 22 mM octyl P-D-glucoside at neutral pH and at low ionic strength (10 mM NaCl), 80% or more of the spike proteins remain bound to the nucleocapsid. The bound spikes can still be seen after negative staining in the electron microscope. When either the pH is increased or the ionic strength is raised above 50 mM, the spike proteins dissociate from the nucleocapsid. This sensitivity to pH and to salt concentration suggests that the interaction of the spike proteins with the nucleocapsid depends on charged groups.",

The viral membrane apparently adheres to the nucleocapsid during the contraction, and excess membrane is extruded in the form of blebs. Interestingly, few spike proteins are seen on these blebs suggesting that they contain only lipid and that the spike proteins remain bound to the nucleocapsid during shrinkage. These observations are all in keeping with the postulated interaction of the spike protein with the capsid protein , and though they do not show exactly how these proteins interact, it is probable that each capsid protein binds one spike protein via the internal domain of the E2 chain.",

Using the criteria proposed by Segrest and Feldmann (1974) to search for hydrophobic segments that could be embedded in lipid bilayers, three such segments can be found in the SFV protein sequences. Two of these are in the same hydrophobicity range and of the same length as the transmembrane segment of glycophorin (more than 25 residues in length and uninterrupted by charged amino acids) (Tomita and Marchesi, 1975) . One is located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the E2 protein between glutamine-352 and alanine-391 in SFV and between proline-364 and cysteine-390 in Sindbis virus. The other is in the carboxyl-terminal region of the El protein between isoleucine-413 and leucine-436 in SFV and between threonine-405 and threonine-437 in Sindbis. In all of these segments there is a cluster of basic amino acids marking the carboxyl-terminal end of the hydrophobic peptide, and this is followed in SFV E2 by 3 1 more residues before the carboxyl terminus is reached, and in Sindbis E2 by 33 residues. This internal domain contains a lysine residue in position 440 in SFV (corresponding to an arginine in Sindbis) which is presumably the lysine which was labeled by f~rmyl[~~S]methionyl sulfone methyl phosphate or cross-linked to the capsid protein by dimethyl suberimidate . This domain also contains a tyrosine at position 443, a likely cleavage site for chymotrypsin in experiments in which 25-30 amino acids were cleaved from the carboxyl-terminal region of E2 in microsomal vesicles Garoff and Soderlund, 1978) . This internal domain in the E2 protein shows strong homology between SFV and Sindbis virus, and is probably involved in the interaction with the capsid protein in the viral particle. In the E l protein there are only two arginine residues on the carboxyl-terminal side of the hydrophobic segment. This explains why the approaches used to detect the internal domain of the E l protein failed. Although formal evidence is lacking it seems most likely that the hydrophobic segment of the El chain also spans the membrane and the two arginine residues are on the internal side of the bilayer.",

After chymotrypsin digestion of the viral particle, the hydrophobic stubs left in the membrane have been isolated and sequenced. As expected, the amino-terminal amino acid sequence showed that the E l and the E2 proteins had been cleaved on the amino-terminal external side of the hydrophobic segments at phenylalanine-398 in E 1 and at tyrosine-359 in E2 . A number of putative transmembrane segments have been sequenced in several viral and cellular glycoproteins and a comparison of these sequences reveals certain common features (see Warren, 198 1; Garoff et al., 1982a; . Each segment has at least 20 residues and contains predominantly hydrophobic amino acids. Charged amino acids (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg) are excluded as is Pro. These rules are probably most useful in showing which parts of a polypeptide could not span a lipid bilayer. However, they give no indication as to which residues of a putative spanning segment are actually within the lipid bilayer. This can be illustrated for the putative spanning sequence of El for both SFV and Sindbis. By the above criteria the spanning segment would be eight residues longer in Sindbis than in SFV . Whether more of the Sindbis E 1 chain is actually located within the lipid bilayer than of the SFV E l will demand a more direct method of analysis.",

Pfefferkorn and Hunter (1963) had already shown that the viral phospholipids are largely derived from cellular phospholipids synthesized before infection. Subsequent studies of the phospholipid, glycolipid, and cholesterol content of the alphaviruses have shown that the lipid composi-tions are very similar if not identical to that of the host cell plasma membrane (Renkonen et al., 1971; Laine et al., 1972; Quigley et al., 1971; Hirschberg and Robbins, 1974) . By growing the viruses in different host cells, large differences can be obtained in the viral lipid composition (Luukkonen et al., 1976) . The small differences observed between the lipid compositions of the viral envelope and of the host plasma membrane can in general be attributed to the contamination of the plasma membrane preparations which cannot be purified to the same extent as those of the virus. Whether alphaviruses assert any selectivity on the set of lipids they take with them from the host cell plasma membrane is therefore difficult to ascertain. On the other hand, the lack of demonstrable specificity is consistent with what is generally known of proteinlipid interactions in biological membranes (Chapman et al., 1979; Seelig and Seelig, 1980) . With present methods, specificity cannot usually be demonstrated. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that viral lipids are more or less passively incorporated into the viral particle during budding from the plasma membrane.",

The distribution of the different phospholipids between the two monolayers has been studied with SFV grown in BHK-21 cells (van Meer et al., 1981) . The phospholipids are localized by using phospholipid exchange proteins, by digestion with phospholipases, and by labeling with trinitrobenzenesulfonate. Phosphatidylcholine appears to be about equally distributed whereas phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin are enriched in the inner monolayer. Phosphatidylserine has not yet been localized. Altogether, 30% of the viral phospholipids can be assigned to the outer monolayer and 50% to the inner monolayer; 20% (phosphatidylserine and some minor phospholipids) have not yet been assigned. Apart from the phospholipids (48 mol% of the total lipid), SFV grown in BHK-21 cells contains 48 mol% cholesterol and 4 mol% glycolipids (Renkonen et al., 197 1) . Comparable experiments using VSV grown in BHK-2 1 cells have given similar distributions of lipids in the two halves of the bilayer (see Patzer et al., 1979) . Table I gives a compilation of the molecular composition of SFV grown in BHK-2 1 cells, based on the revised weight for the viral particle of 41-42 x lo6 daltons (Jacrot et al., 1983) . If one assumes that each hospholipid-cholesterol pair takes up a surface area of about 90-100 fi i 2 (Israelachvili and Mitchell, 1975) and each glycolipid about 55 A* (Pascher and Sundell, 1977) , then about 80% of the surface area in the bilayer is occupied by the lipids, leaving about 20% for the spanning proteins. This is somewhat more than would be expected if 180 spike proteins span the bilayer, each having two transmembrane a helical segments. The underlying assumptions in Table I are that the nucleocapsid is built according to T = 3 icosahedral symmetry, and that the symmetric arrangement of the spike proteins would be dictated by the direct interaction of one spike glycoprotein with one capsid protein. This interaction is assumed to be the basic structural design of the viral particle. There is no evidence that the nucleocapsid penetrates into the lipid bilayer and interacts with the lipids directly. The isolated nucleocapsid does not bind Triton X-100 and its primary structure shows no obvious hydrophobic regions (Helenius and Soderlund, 1973; Garoff et al., 1980a) .",

The viral glycoproteins are assembled in the ER membrane, then modified and transported via the Golgi complex to the cell surface. The newly made nucleocapsids bind to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane via the viral glycoproteins, and function as a template for binding more spike glycoproteins. The plasma membrane becomes modified as it wraps around the nucleocapsid and is finally released into the extracellular medium. Only a few functions needed for virus replication are specified by the viral RNA; for the most part the virus exploits the normal function of the host cell.

SFV can infect a wide variety of cultured cells of mammalian, avian, or invertebrate origin, suggesting that the virus must recog-nize surface structures common to many different cell types (Mussgay et al., 1975) . For BHK-21 cells, SFV binds with an apparent binding constant of 3 X 10\"M-' at pH 6.8; the apparent number of sites is 50 x lo3 (Fries and Helenius, 1979) . Using the SFV spike proteins isolated in a water-soluble form as (El, E2, E3) octamers, binding to the H2 and HLA cell surface glycoproteins can be demonstrated (Helenius et al., 1978) . However, more recent studies show that these common cell surface antigens cannot be the sole receptors for SFV. There are murine cell lines which do not express major H2-histocompatibility antigens but the cells can nevertheless be infected with SFV (Oldstone et al., 1980) . The major problem confronting researchers studying virus-receptor interactions is the multivalency of the binding which leads to tight attachment of the virus to the cell surface even if the interaction between one individual spike protein and one cell surface receptor is of low affinity. The low affinity makes biochemical studies of cell surface receptors for SFV difficult, and which surface molecules can function as receptors for the virus remains unknown. The interaction does not seem to involve sialic acid, since this sugar is not found in mosquito cells (Stollar et al., 1976) .",

            "text": "Careful studies by electron microscopy have shown that SFV enters the cell by endocytosis . No evidence for fusion at the cell surface has ever been obtained. The cell-bound viruses are rapidly (within seconds) internalized at 37\u00b0C into coated vesicles which form by invagination of the coated pits and usually carry only one viral particle. After 1 minute or longer, viruses can be observed accumulating into larger, irregularly shaped vacuoles. These prelysosomal vacuoles have been named endosomes (see Marsh et al., 1983) or receptosomes (see Pastan and Willingham, 1981) . The endosomes are devoid of lysosomal enzymes, and are probably important in membrane recycling. From these vacuoles some viruses find their way into lysosomes, as demonstrated by lysosome-specific staining procedures . The internalization process can be followed quantitatively by using radiolabeled virus and the susceptibility of bound virus to protease treatment; proteinase K at 0\u00b0C removes surface-bound viruses but not internalized viruses . The uptake process is extremely efficient. The half-life of a virus particle on the cell surface is less than 20 minutes (Marsh and Helenius, 1980) . The uptake is saturable at high virus concentrations. However, the saturation observed is due to saturation of binding and not of endocytosis. The highest average rate of uptake measured is around 2000 viral particles per minute per cell. Since, on average, 1.3 viral particles are internalized per coated vesicle, the measured uptake of 2000 viral particles per minute means that, on average, 1600 coated vesicles internalize viruses from the cell surface per minute. This uptake is not induced by the virus. The maximal rate of virus uptake corresponds to the ongoing endocytic rate of BHK-21 cells measured by [3H]sucrose uptake. Thus, SFV uptake must occur by a continuous cellular process. This process is clearly distinguished from phagocytosis which is blocked by cytochalasin B, does not involve small coated vesicles, shows different kinetics, and is induced by the particle to be phagocytosed (Silverstein et al., 1977) . Instead, the SFV uptake into BHK-2 1 cells has exactly the same characteristics as receptor-mediated endocytosis (Goldstein et al., 1979) . This interpretation is supported by a large number of similarities between SFV uptake and the endocytosis of physiological ligands such as low-density lipoproteins, asialoglycoproteins, epidermal growth factor, cup-macroglobulin, and lysosomal enzymes (Kaplan, 1981 ; Anderson and Kaplan, 1983) . These similarities include temperature dependence; kinetics; the involvement of coated pits, coated vesicles, endosomes, and lysosomes; and the effect of inhibitors. The only efficient way to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis is to lower the temperature below 10\u00b0C. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation also have a marked inhibitory effect on the rate of endocytosis, at least in BHK-21 cells. As shown for a number of physiological ligands, the number of receptors on the cell surface does not decrease by adding saturating amounts of SFV and letting the viruses endocytose. The cell surface receptors are probably taken into the cell with their ligands which then dissociate, and the receptors are then recycled back to the surface within a matter of minutes (Pearse and Bretscher, 1981) .",

Five well-characterized lysosomal inhibitors (chloroquine, NH,Cl, amantadine, tributylamine, and methylamine) block infection by SFV . These agents have no direct viricidal effect, and no effect on cell viability during the span of the experiments. Moreover, they do not block binding or endocytosis of the virus. They prevent release of the RNA from an intracellular vacuole into the cytoplasm. This release can be assayed by lysing cells and using ribonuclease as a probe for RNA location; when the nucleocapsid has penetrated into the cytoplasm the viral RNA becomes susceptible to ribonuclease attack. The common target of these lipophilic bases is the lysosome. Being weak bases they rapidly accumulate in this acidic organelle, and raise the lysosomal pH (De Duve et al., 1974;  Poole and Ohkuma, 1981) . Inhibition of SFV infection can be achieved using concentrations of the inhibitors which have been shown to increase the pH of the lysosomes from 4.8 to around 6. Recent results indicate that not only do the lysosomes have an acidic pH, but that the endosomes are acidic as well (Tycho and Maxfield, 1982) . Thus, lysosomal inhibitors could also assert their inhibitory effect on SFV infection by raising the pH of the endosomes. In fact, it seems likely that this is the case (Marsh et al., 1983) . Since lysosomal inhibitors like chloroquine and NH&l raise the lysosomal pH within seconds, they can be used to pinpoint the time at which infection can no longer be inhibited. Such studies show that addition of the inhibitor within 4 minutes after viral entry from the cell surface gives virtually complete inhibition of viral infection whereas after 6 minutes the agent is largely ineffective in preventing the penetration of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. These times are more consistent with the effect being localized to endosomes since morphological studies show that viruses do not reach the lysosomes within 6 minutes after leaving the cell surface Marsh et al., 1983) . More data have been obtained using other ligands. Dunn et al. (1980) have shown that in perfused livers the passage of asialoglycoprotein from endosomes to lysosomes can be prevented by simply lowering the temperature to 20\u00b0C. Endocytic uptake into the endosomes is slowed but not inhibited. At this temperature Marsh et al. (1983) have shown that SFV can still infect BHK-21 cells. Moreover, the release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (as measured by the ribonuclease assay) proceeds, albeit 40% more slowly than at 37\u00b0C. Thin-section electron microscopy confirms that SFV particles are not transferred to lysosomes at this temperature.",

            "text": "Although the evidence is still incomplete, Sindbis virus seems to enter its host cells by the same mechanism as SFV Vance, 1980, 1982) . Moreover, this mechanism is more general since influenza virus and VSV also enter canine kidney cells (MDCK) by endocytosis and by low-pH-mediated fusion ( M a t h et al., 1981, 1982) . Influenza virus is especially interesting in this context. The major spike glycoprotein, the hemagglutinin, is responsible for the fusion process (Maeda and Ohnishi, 1980; Huang et al., 1981; White et al., 1981) . The protein consists of two polypeptide chains HA1 and HA2 (see . The amino-terminal end of the HA2 polypeptide chain is hydrophobic (Skehel and Waterfield, 1975; Porter et al., 1979) , and it is this part of the molecule which seems to be involved in the low-pHinduced fusion activity (Richardson et al., 1980) . Bromelain treatment releases a water-soluble spike of the hemagglutinin molecule from the viral particle, leaving a short hydrophobic stub in the viral membrane (Brand and Skehel, 1972) . The bromelain-released spike protein has been crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure has been determined to 2.8 8, resolution (Wilson et al., 1981) . From this structure it is known that the amino-terminal end of the HA2 polypeptide is not available for direct interaction with a target lipid membrane. If, however, the water-soluble spike is subjected to a pH below 6, a drastic conformational change is induced which can be followed by circular dichroism (Skehel et al., 1982) . As a result of the low-pH treatment, the spike protein becomes hydrophobic; it binds Triton X-100, it aggregates to form protein micelles, and it attaches to liposomes. Model building based on the spike protein structure suggests that the amino-terminal end of the HA2 protein can be exposed by a conformational change so as to participate in hydrophobic interactions. Through this interaction the viral membrane and the target membrane might be brought into the close proximity needed to initiate the fusion reaction between the two lipid bilayers.",

It might be that the low pH is the crucial factor. Low pH has a drastic effect on the SFV nucleocapsid causing it to shrink from a diameter of about 400 to 320 A (Soderlund et al., 1972) . This conformational change may induce uncoating of the RNA, although clearly some other factor is also required since uncoating does not occur by low pH alone. The Sindbis virus nucleocapsid does not undergo a similar shrinkage, although the lowest pH tested was 6 and the pH in the endosomes and in the lysosomes is lower than this (Sdderlund et al., 1979) .",

The 3' end of the 42 S RNA contains the genes for the structural proteins but these are not translated. The nonstructural proteins are subunits of one or more RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which are needed for the replication of the viral RNA (Clegg et al., 1976; Lachmi and Kaariainen, 1976 ; Ranki and Kaariainen, 1979 ; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1980; Lehtovaara et al., 1980) . Two major species of RNA molecules, new 42 S and 26 S RNA, are formed during viral infection (see Strauss and Strauss, 1977) . The 26 S RNA molecule is a subgenomic copy of the 3' end of the 42 S RNA and serves as a messenger RNA for the structural proteins (Kennedy, 1976; Wengler and Wengler, 1976 ; Schlesinger and Kaariainen, 1980) . The viral RNA polymerase first transcribes the incoming positivestranded 42 S RNA into negative-stranded 42 S RNA, which in turn serves as a template for the synthesis of both new positive-stranded 42 S RNA molecules and 26 S RNA molecules. The transcription of the 26 S RNA is initiated internally on the negative-stranded 42 S RNA. RNA replication seems to take place on membranes in characteristic cytoplasmic vacuoles, called cytopathic vacuoles I (CPV I), which appear soon after infection and are not seen in uninfected cells (Grimley et al., 1968 Friedman et ab, 1972) . The detailed mechanism of the RNA replication will not be dealt with here (for reviews see Strauss and Strauss, 1977;  Kaariainen and Soderlund, 1978; Kennedy, 1980) .",

The mechanism of host protein shutoff is not yet known, but studies by van Steeg (1982) suggest that it is the viral capsid protein itself which is responsible for the selective inhibition of host protein synthesis. The capsid protein seems to reduce the activity of the initiation factors e 1 F-4B and CAP binding protein below levels necessary for the formation of the 80 S initiation complex from host mRNA. Translation of the viral 26 S RNA is, however, unaffected. More studies are clearly needed to substantiate this interesting possibility.",

To assemble new nucleocapsids only two components are needed: capsid proteins and 42 S RNA. The capsid protein is the first to be translated from the 26 S RNA and is cleaved from the nascent polypeptide chain soon after it has been completed (Clegg, 1975; Garoff and Soderlund, 1978; . The proteolytic cleavage may be catalyzed by the capsid protein itself (Aliperti and Schlesinger, 1978) . The newly synthesized capsid protein first associates with the large ribosomal subunit before it binds to the 42 S to form nucleocapsids (Glanville and Ulmanen, 1976; Ulmanen et al., 1976; Soderlund and Ulmanen, 1977) . This process is fast and efficient (Soderlund, 1973) . Only completed nucleocapsids can be detected in the infected cell (see Kaariainen and SiSderlund, 1978) . Neither empty capsids nor partially completed aggregates of RNA and capsid proteins have been identified. Apparently, not only protein-protein interactions, but also RNA-protein interactions play a decisive role not only in initiating the encapsidation process but also in stabilizing the nucleocapsid. Ribonuclease treatment leads to contraction of the nucleocapsid, and, in combination with EDTA treatment, the structure of the SFV nucleocapsid is destroyed (Kaariainen and Soderlund, 1971; Soderlund et ul., 1975).",

The proteins are translated sequentially; capsid protein is followed by the p62 protein and then by the E l protein . The assembly of the polypeptide chains can be monitored by protease treatment (Wirth el al., 1977) . Microsomal vesicles are impermeable to proteases, and only structures on the outside (the cytoplasmic side) are accessible to proteolytic degradation. Most of the p62 and all of the E l polypeptide chains are inaccessible to protease as soon as they can be detected, whereas the capsid protein and the 97K protein are completely degraded. It is the carboxyl-terminal end of the p62 protein that is degraded as expected since the E2 part spans the membrane (Garoff and Soderlund, 1978) . Transfer of the p62 and El chains through the ER membrane takes place concomitantly with translation. If microsomes are added to the in vitro system after translation of the polypeptide chains is completed, no transfer takes place. By synchronized translation experiments modeled according to Rothman and Lodish (1977) , it can be shown that the microsomal membranes must be added before about 100 amino acids of the p62 chain have been translated if subsequent assembly of the protein into the membrane is to occur . Thus the signal peptide responsible for the initiation of transfer to the ER must be located in the amino-terminal end of the p62 protein in the E3 part.",

In cells infected with this mutant at the restrictive temperature, the E 1 protein is assembled in the correct orientation into the membrane of the ER. The uncleaved protein containing the capsid and the p62 sequences (M, = 87,000) is left in the cytoplasm.

A signal peptide at the amino-terminal end of the nascent polypeptide to be segregated is recognized by what we now know is a cytoplasmic signal recognition protein which binds the ribosome. This halts translation until the complex binds to a docking protein in the ER membrane so that transfer of the polypeptide chain across the membrane can then take place (Walter and Blobel, 1982a,b; Meyer et aL, 1982) .

They constructed a series of deletion mutants from the cDNA (copied from the 26 S SFV RNA), in which the DNA sequences coding for the carboxyl-terminal end of the E2 protein have been shortened, and the 6K and the E l regions deleted. These DNA molecules containing the genes for the capsid and the shortened p62 protein have been inserted, under control of the early SV40 promoter, in vectors designed for expression of cDNA molecules in animal cells. The DNA molecules have been introduced into the nucleus of BHK-21 cells by microinjection, and the expression of the p62 protein is studied by immunofluorescence using antibodies specific to the E2 protein. Their results show that a shortened gene coding for only three of the amino acids of the internal (cytoplasmic) domain of the E2 protein (together with seven extra amino acids provided by a stop-linker nucleotide) is expressed normally, assembled into the ER, and transported to the cell surface. However, when the deletion extends into the region coding for the hydrophobic domain, the E2 protein precursor appears not to become membrane bound but is instead secreted into the ER lumen.",

For the alphaviruses the evidence is not as complete, but it seems to correspond to the pattern established for VSV. After transfer of a primary high-mannose-type oligosaccharide [(Glc)s(Man)~(GlcNAc)2] to the polypeptide chain during translation, the glucose residues are removed. This is followed by the removal of the four a-( 1 --* 2)-linked mannose residues within 20-30 minutes after trans- fer (Robbins el al., 1977; Hubbard and Robbins, 1979) . Two or more mannose residues are then removed, but only after an N-acetylglucosamine residue has been linked to the internal pentasaccharide (Kornfeld et Harpaz and Schachter, 1980a,b) . Terminal carbohydrate residues are then added to construct the complex oligosaccharide side chains. The conversion of high-mannose type to complex oligosaccharides can be monitored conveniently using the enzyme endo-P-Nacetylglucosaminidase H which cleaves the bond between the two N-acetylglucosamine residues in the high-mannose-type oligosaccharide (Tarentino and Maley, 1974; Tarentino et al., 1978) . Complex oligosaccharides are resistant to this enzyme. The alphavirus glycoproteins become resistant to endo-/3-N-acetylgIucosaminidase H about 20-30 minutes after synthesis (Robbins et d., 1977; Green et d., 1981) .",

            "text": "Direct evidence for the involvement of the stacks of Golgi cisternae in the intracellular pathway to the cell surface for membrane glycoproteins came once again from studies with viral glycoproteins (Bergmann et al., 1981; Green et al., 1981) . The most extensive studies have been carried out with SFV. BHK-21 cells infected with SFV have been treated with cycloheximide to stop further synthesis of the viral proteins (Green et al., 1981) . The viral glycoproteins can then be localized at different times in thin frozen sections of the cells using antibodies against the spike protein labeled indirectly with ferritin or gold particles. This immunocytochemical method allows precise and quantitative localization of the antigens at the ultrastructural level (Tokuyasu, 1980; Griffiths et al., 1983a) . Before the addition of cycloheximide the spike proteins are found throughout the membranes of the ER, in all cisternae of the Golgi stacks, and at the cell surface. After the addition of cycloheximide the spike proteins move from the ER through the Golgi stack to the cell surface. Membrane carrier vesicles between the ER and the Golgi, and between the Golgi and the cell surface, could not be identified with certainty. The spike proteins spent about 15 minutes in the ER after the cycloheximide block, and another 15 minutes in the Golgi stack before being routed to the cell surface. Parallel biochemical studies show that many of the oligosaccharides in the viral spike proteins are modified to the complex forms at the same time that the proteins pass through the Golgi stacks. Cell fractionation studies reveal the same pattern; the proteins pass from the ER to the plasma membrane via a vesicle fraction. This fraction must be derived at least in part from the Golgi complex, because it was isolated according to its content of two Golgi markers, galactosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in the formation of complex oligosaccharide chains, and an antigen ( M , = 135,000) specifically localized in the Golgi complex (Green et al., 1981; Louvard et al., 1982) . Further studies have shown that the Golgi stack in BHK-21 cells can be divided into at least three distinct parts, the cis, medial, and trans compartments, each comprising one and at most two Golgi cisternae (Griffiths et al., 1982 (Griffiths et al., , 1983b Quinn et al., 1983) . These three compartments have been defined by cytochemical and immunocytochemical criteria (Fig. 3) . The pattern of cytochemical labeling is not changed during SFV infection. About 5 hours after infection, rod-shaped structures covered with viral nucleocapsids appear in the infected cells. These have been observed earlier and have been called cytopathic vacuoles I1 (CPV 11) (Acheson and Tamm, 1967; Grimley et al., 1968) . In cross section the rods appear as membrane vesicles with nucleocapsids around their outer surface. These membranes are always labeled with ricin and with antibodies to the spike protein. Their function is unclear but they could be aberrant products caused by the massive transport of spike proteins through the cell. These structures are usually found on the trans side of the Golgi stack, and have been used to define the polarity of the stack, which is otherwise difficult to do in BHK-21 cells (Griffiths et al., 1982) . When cycloheximide is added to infected cells to stop viral protein synthesis, the labeling with ricin of the trans cisternae decreases by about 50% after the spike proteins have been shown to leave the Golgi stacks. Since ricin labels carbohydrate side chains only after they have been trimmed and galactose has been added, these data suggest that the spike proteins acquire their galactose residues in the trans part of the Golgi in which galactosyltransferase has recently been found to be localized in other cells (Roth and Berger, 1982) . The viral proteins in the cis part of the Golgi are not labeled with ricin; their carbohydrate side chains have thus not yet been processed to the complex type. These results are in keeping with the movement of the spike proteins from the cis to the trans side of the Golgi stack.",

            "text": "A successful tool in the early studies of metabolic pathways was blocking the pathway at some specific point. This could be done by the use of either mutants or inhibitors. Schekman et al. have isolated a number of yeast mutants with blocks in their secretion pathway (Schekman, 1982) . It is not yet known which proteins these mutations affect, but this is clearly a most promising approach for identifying those components involved in transport. In animal cells there are no cellular mutants with blocks in the intracellular transport of protein from the ER to the cell surface. There are, however, genetic diseases which affect the routing of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes (Neufeld et al., 1975; Sly and Fischer, 1982) . For viruses it has been possible to isolate temperaturesensitive mutants in which a mutation in the viral glycoprotein arrests the protein in different cellular locations at the nonpermissive temperature (see Pfefferkorn, 1977; Saraste et al., 1980a; Zilberstein et al., 1980) . A number of inhibitors have also been found that inhibit intracellular transport at different intracellular sites (see Tartakoff, 1980) . Burge and Pfefferkorn (1966a,b) were the first to characterize a number of temperature-sensitive mutants of Sindbis virus. A mutant was found in which the viral glycoprotein appears to accumulate in the ER at the nonpermissive temperature, and, after shifting down to the permissive temperature, is transported to the cell surface (Bell and Waite, 1977; Smith and Brown, 1977; Saraste et al., 1980a) . KaiPriPinen and co-workers have characterized a number of SFV mutants (Keranen and Kaariainen, 1974; Saraste et al., 1980b; Pesonen et al., 1981) . In one mutant, ts-1, the glycoproteins are arrested in the ER at the restrictive temperature. The mutation is reversible; transport of the spike glycoproteins to the cell surface occurs when the temperature is lowered to 28\u00b0C. Spike glycoproteins from ts-1 mutants have oligosaccharide side chains exclusively of the high-mannose type at 39\"C, but after a shift to 28\"C, about 35% of the oligosaccharides are converted to complex glycans in keeping with a transport defect which arrests the proteins in the ER. Saraste et al. (1980b) have postulated the existence of \"transport signals\" carried by the viral glycoproteins (see also Blobel, 1980) . These signals should be recognized by the cellular mechanisms responsible for sorting proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex, and from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. Since the cytoplasmic domain of the SFV spike glycoproteins can be essentially deleted without affecting the transport of the protein to the cell surface, one would assume that the signals for sorting are localized either in the transmembrane domain or in the hydrophilic portion of the spike. However, the basic cluster at the cytoplasmic end (see Section II,B, 1) still remained in these deletion mutants, and it could, of course, be involved in transport.",

Monensin appears to block transport at some point in the Golgi complex but the precise site has been difficult to localize because monensin destroys the characteristic morphology of the Golgi stacks; the flattened cisternae become swollen and separated from each other. Interestingly, in cells infected with SFV or Sindbis virus, some of the swollen Golgi cisternae are found to be covered with nucleocapsids bound to the cytoplasmic face. Apparently, the accumulation of viral spike proteins in these swollen cisternae leads to the binding of numerous nucleocapsids. This observation has made it possible to determine the site at which monensin blocks the transport of SFV glycoproteins in BHK-21 cells. Observations from a variety of cytochemical and immunocytochemical experiments suggest that this site is located between the medial and the trans cisternae in the Golgi stack (Griffiths et al., 1983b; Quinn et al., 1983) . In infected BHK-21 cells treated with monensin there was no significant trimming of the high-mannose residues or conversion of the carbohydrate side chains to their complex forms.

Earlier studies have suggested that acylation does not occur in the ER (Schmidt and Schlesinger, 1980) .

As a specific example, we can consider chick embryo fibroblasts infected with SFV (Pesonen and Kaarihinen, 1982) . In these cells, monensin does not inhibit p62 cleavage, and some conversion of simple to complex oligosaccharides is found to take place (and some intermediate forms are found that are not present normally), but the appearance of the spike proteins on the cell surface is efficiently blocked. In these cells the monensin block would appear to be distal to the medial cisternae, perhaps even after the Golgi stack.",

The results using monensin show that at least in chicken embryo fibroblasts the cleavage can take place intracellularly . The evidence that the p62 cleavage is a cell surface event is based on the finding that antibodies to the spike glycoproteins applied externally block the cleavage. However, since these antibodies may enter the cell by endocytosis and exert their effect intracellularly, these experiments do not rule out an intracellular cleavage. The p62 cleavage takes place about 5 minutes after the viral spike glycoproteins become resistant to endoacetylglucosaminidase H (Green et al., 1981) .

At least 99.5% of the protein in the alphavirus particle is viral (capsid, El, E2, and E3) (Strauss, 1978) . The central problem in budding at the molecular level is to understand how the nucleocapsid and the viral spike proteins recognize each other at the cell surface . The realization that the SFV spike glycoproteins span the membrane led to the proposal that the binding of the spike proteins to the nucleocapsid was the major driving force in the budding process . Another interaction facilitating the assembly may be the formation of lateral contacts between the spike proteins (McCarthy and Harrison, 1977; von Bonsdorff and Harrison, 1978) . The alphavirus spike glycoproteins move by lateral diffusion after insertion into the cell surface (Birdwell and Strauss, 1974) . Their diffusion coefficients have been measured by fluorescence ,photobleaching recovery experiments (Johnson et al., 198 l) , and are approximately 5 X 10-lo cm2 sec-', which is in the range reported for other cell surface glycoproteins (Peters, 1981) . However, the longer infection proceeds, the larger the fraction of the spike proteins that become immobile on the time scale of the measurements; 7 hours after infection 14% are mobile and after 10 hours only about 1%. The immobile fraction may be due to the formation of spike protein aggregates in the membrane plane (see however Johnson et al., 1981 , for an alternative explanation). There is evidence that budding may occur in patches especially at the cell periphery Birdwell et al., 1973) , whereas other areas of the cell surface are devoid of budding figures when examined in the electron microscope. However, it should be pointed out that in other cells there seems to be no clustering of budding figures.",

The binding must be mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of the E2 protein attaching to a capsid protein in the nucleocapsid. Wrapping of the plasma membrane around the nucleocapsid proceeds when more spike proteins move in and become attached to the underlying nucleocapsid. When the nucleocapsid is completely enclosed by the modified plasma membrane, it may pinch off simply from the strain of the curvature imposed by the nucleocapsidspike protein interactions. The resealing of the disrupted lipid bilayer would occur spontaneously. In keeping with this self-assembly model for budding, the process seems to be independent of metabolic energy (Waite and Pfefferkorn, 1970; Waite et al., 1972) . If cells infected with Sindbis virus are treated with low salt (ionic strength 0.105) further budding is arrested; the nucleocapsids bind to the plasma membrane but do not bud. Treatment of arrested cells with metabolic inhibitors does not affect the subsequent release of viral particles after restoring the cells to normal ionic conditions. The budding process can also be inhibited by antibodies to the spike proteins (Bracha and Schlesinger, 1976) . In thin section electron micrographs of such cells, cross-linked clusters of spike proteins can be seen on the external cell surface apposed to clusters of nucleocapsids on the opposite side of the membrane (Smith and Brown, 1977) .",

BHK-21 cells infected with SFV are synthesizing about 100,000 spike proteins per minute between 4 and 6 hours after infection. Quantitation in thin, frozen sections shows that the spike proteins spend on average about 15 minutes in both the ER and in the Golgi compartments (Green et al., 1981) . Hence at any time there should be about 1,500,000 spike proteins in each of these membrane systems. The surface areas of the ER and the Golgi membranes in infected cells have been determined morphometrically so that the density of spike proteins can be calculated. These amount to about 85 and 800 spike proteins/pm2 for ER and Golgi membranes, respectively. Since a typical concentration of spanning proteins in many biological membranes is about 20,000/pm2, it is clear that at no time during intracellular transport do the spike proteins constitute more than 1 in 250 endogenous ER or 1 in 25 endogenous Golgi proteins. At the cell surface, the spike proteins accumulate and completed viral particles contain about 30,000 spike proteins/pm2. The low concentrations of spike proteins in transit probably ensure that budding does not take place intracellularly . Other factors may also be operative. The cytoplasmic domain of the E2 chain may not be available for interactions with the nucleocapsid at all stages of intracellular transport. Also the cleavage of the p62 protein which takes place shortly before budding may facilitate the molecular interactions involved in the budding process.",

However, because at any time a very small fraction of the protein undergoing intracellular transport is present in the carriers shuttling components from one organelle to another, identification of the carriers has proven to be exceedingly difficult.",

There has to be some sorting device involved which leaves the proteins belonging to the organelle behind. When a membrane vesicle is formed from one organelle and transported to fuse with another, there must also be replenishment of membrane lipids lost. This cannot in most cases be due to the synthesis of new lipids, but is probably due to a compensating backward traffic of membrane. The membrane vesicles mediating the traffic in both directions must recognize their target membranes, and carry a fusion mechanism for delivery of membrane from one organelle to another.",

In vitro systems need to be worked out, and there are already some promising beginnings in this direction (Fries and Rothman, 1980; Rothman and Fries, 1981) . Since molecular studies of cellular sorting processes still seem some way off, it might be useful to consider whether there are any other analogous processes more amenable to experimental study. In principle, SFV budding is such a sorting process. The nucleocapsid is the sorter; the affinity between the capsid protein and the spike protein enables the capsid to sort the viral glycoprotein into a membrane vesicle, the viral particle. The topology of the viral vesicle is reversed compared to intracellular membrane carrier vesicles; the viral vesicle has the cytoplasmic side of the membrane toward the inside, whereas the carrier vesicle has it on the outside. In the viral particle the nucleocapsid functions as a scaffold from the inside, whereas in coated vesicles the clathrin coat forms a polyhedral basket on the outside (Pearse and Bretscher, 1981) . In viral budding the specificity of the sorting process is tight. Essentially no host proteins are included and only if a cell is infected with two different alphaviruses, e.g., Sindbis virus and eastern equine encephalitis virus, does the viral particle contain spike glycoproteins from both viruses (Burge and Pfefferkorn, 1966~) .",

            "text": "The budding process of more complicated enveloped viruses such as VSV bears even more resemblance to intracellular sorting. In this virus there is a layer of protein composed of the M protein. This layer lies between the nucleocapsid and the lipid bilayer (which contains one species of a spanning glycoprotein, the G protein) (see . The budding of VSV occurs at the cell surface and is most likely driven by an interaction between the G protein and the internal M protein, although an interaction between the G protein and the nucleocapsid proteins cannot be excluded at present. However, unlike alphaviruses, there is no precise stoichiometry between the G and the M proteins (Lodish and Porter, 1980a) . The ratio between them can vary by a factor of about six whereas the ratio between the M protein and nucleocapsid proteins stays constant. In addition, the specificity is not as strict as with the alphaviruses. Mixed phenotypes, that is viruses produced from doubly infected cells and containing the spike proteins of two viruses but only one nucleocapsid, can easily be produced (Zavada, 1982) . These contain the VSV nucleocapsid, the VSV M protein, and VSV G proteins mixed with the spike glycoproteins of the other virus used for double infection. Viral particles containing the nucleocapsid and M proteins from the other virus, with a mixture of spike proteins, may also be formed. VSV can form mixed phenotypes with alphaviruses (but not the reverse), RNA tumor viruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses. Cellular glycoproteins are excluded from the viral envelope (see, however, Lodish and Porter, 1980b) . The inclusion of the foreign viral spike glycoproteins could be due to an interaction either directly with the VSV M protein or with a critical amount of VSV G protein through which association with the M protein could occur (see Witte and Baltimore, 1977) . The VSV M protein plays an essential role in the budding process and it can be considered analogous to the capsid protein in SFV, but very little is known of how it functions. A closer study of the VSV M protein in viral spike glycoprotein interactions might be of considerable interest now that methods based on cDNA technology are available which could be used for this purpose.",

The paucity of functions that seem unique to the virus is striking. The binding of the virus to the cell surface and the fusion of its membrane intracellularly depend on the viral spike glycoproteins. RN A-dependent RNA polymerases specific for the virus catalyze the replication of the viral RNA. Exit from the cell requires the interaction of the viral spike proteins with the viral capsid protein. Close scrutiny of some of these processes may disclose that they are not unique after all. They may, in fact, have evolved from cellular counterparts.",

In cell biology the use of viruses as tools has only started. A number of new approaches are emerging. Polarized epithelial cells infected with enveloped viruses distribute the spike glycoproteins to either the apical or the basolateral membrane domain of the cell surface (Rodriguez et al., 1980) . There are other enveloped viruses that bud intracellularly ; bunyaviruses probably assemble in the Golgi apparatus (Bishop and Shope, 1979;  Madoff and Lenard, 1982; , whereas coronaviruses mainly bud into the ER (McIntosh, 1974) . Their glycoproteins can probably be used as models for the assembly of these organelles. There are viruses like rabies and herpes which enter neurons at peripheral nerve endings and move into the central nervous system probably by retrograde axonal transport (Wolinsky and Johnson, 1980) . These examples are by no means exhaustive. There is a plethora of different viruses each of which has adapted to a combination of cellular functions for its own selfish purposes.",
