The first case in the Indian subcontinent was reported on 16 May 2009 [1]. In a matter of few weeks it spread to large parts of the country. After the reports of the epidemic the Government of India, anticipating the spread of the pandemic, initiated the containment phase. On 11th June 2009 the WHO raised level of pandemic alert from phase 5 to phase 6, considering community-level outbreaks in at least 1 country in \u22652 WHO regions [2].",

These guidelines were released at the time when the pandemic was underway, there was sustained human-to-human transmission and containment was not possible. The patients who were in Category \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d were managed on a domiciliary basis with instructions for follow up. Oral Oseltamivir was given as per the guidelines. Telephonic calls were made after 24 and 48 h to assess the clinical course. Patients with Category \u201cC\u201d symptoms were admitted. Detailed history (including travel history, any contacts, and previous premorbid conditions) and clinical examination (including anthropometry) was done for all patients. Relevant routine investigations, chest radiographs and blood cultures were done. A naso-pharyngeal swab was taken at the time of admission and stored in the appropriate transport media for Category \u201cC\u201d patients. All samples were sent for RT-PCR the next morning to the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) Delhi. All patients were treated with oral Oseltamivir suspension or capsule as per appropriate weight band for 5 days and supportive care as required as per standard guidelines [4]. Children who tested positive for H1N1 and those awaiting results were kept in separate cubicles. Children who tested positive were isolated in the wards with the parents for 5 days.\n\n",

Our results are in variance with the earlier Indian report by Saha et al done during the containment phase which was suggestive of a very mild disease with no PICU admissions and no deaths [5]. The difference could be due to the categorization of patients which was not suggested earlier or change in the intensity of the evolving pandemic. Similar study from Argentina including a total of 251 hospitalized children with 2009 H1N1 influenza, 47 (19%) were admitted to a PICU, 42 (17%) required mechanical ventilation, and 13 (5%) died [6]. Recently published results from Canada including 234 children also show similar results but mortality in only 2 children [7]. In another study from Canada, a total of 57 children were admitted to 7 PICU\u2019s. One or more chronic comorbid illnesses were observed in 70.2% of patients. Mechanical ventilation was used in 68% of children, 20 children (35.1%) had acute lung injury on the first day of admission. The PICU mortality rate was 7% (4 of 57 patients) [8]. Kumar et al have described 75 hospitalized children from Wisconsin, US. PICU admissions were in 18.6%, 6% required ventilation, 2.6% required ECMO and 2.6% died. Bacterial coinfections occurred in 1.3% and 80% of patients received antibacterials [9]. Similar reports are also available from Australia [10] and China [11].",

Secondly, since only Category \u201cC\u201d patients were tested for pandemic H1N1 virus as per the national guidelines, the exact incidence of 2009 H1N1 influenza on morbidity and mortality is difficult to calculate. Present data could not be compared to seasonal Influenza from the previous years since there is poor routine surveillance from India, although it appears to be statistically similar with our small cohort. Thirdly, the sample size was small and hence the predictors of severe disease or mortality could not be evaluated using a regression model. Also very few patients had underlying problems and hence whether the disease would have a greater impact on some conditions is difficult to predict. Fourthly, we could not study other viruses which could be co-morbid or could be there in the negative group both for H1N1 and seasonal influenza A. Their contribution cannot be ruled out. Since this group would be very heterogeneous it was not compared.",
