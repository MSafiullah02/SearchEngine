Dr. Melanie Saville, Director of Vaccine Development from CEPI, introduced the concept by discussing possible Disease X pathogens stressing they may be currently known or unknown. This may include known threats such as Ebola, known viruses with unrecognized impacts such as Zika, and unknown threats not previously identified. Current global trends indicate that a new disease emerges every four months, and more likely than not, Disease X will emerge as zoonotic in origin, as nearly 60% of all pandemics fit that model. The need to identify a burgeoning outbreak and initiate development of countermeasures was stressed. Citing a key example from the 1918 flu pandemic, which was modeled by the Vaccine Modeling Initiative and presented recently by the Gates Foundation [1], were such a pandemic to occur today, all major cities in the world would be impacted, with 13 million dead within 60 days. A more recent example was coordination of the global response to the 2014\u20132016 West Africa Ebola pandemic and the challenges with fielding and testing therapeutic and vaccine candidates [2]. A review of the Ebola response produced four key recommendations: (1) strengthen human-animal surveillance systems as the first line of defense; (2) reinforce global coordination and capabilities; (3) accelerate product development, and; (4) provide economic incentives to help.",

It was recognized, however, that regulators license vaccines, not platforms, so even the use of well-established platforms for rapid vaccine development for an emerging virus may not allow for rapid regulatory approval and regulatory agencies vary globally.

Modern technology (Next Generation Sequencing, NGS) has been widely implemented in the diagnosis and tracking of infectious diseases. However, there is room for improvement-leveraging the full potential of this technology has been hindered by several factors: groups working in isolation (i.e., not sharing data in a timely manner); limited access to samples from the countries most effected by an outbreak; failure to capture and annotate critical information on the time and precise location of sample collection.\u2022A suggestion for improving the global biosurveillance enterprise is to transition from monitoring the advance of specific outbreaks over time (vertical surveillance) to horizontal surveillance (quantifying the presence of diverse pathogens across the population over time).\u2022Another suggestion is to create standard criteria for assessing global viral threats-tropism, replication, structure, genotype, evolution, immune evasion, pathogenesis, animal models, and correlates of protection. However, this may be difficult for viruses that can utilize a range of hosts, vectors, etc.\u2022To achieve the ultimate goal of fully implemented global health biosurveillance we should be proactive instead of reactive.\u2022It is imperative to solve the problem of sustainable funding. A general consensus of the group on this topic was that to produce a blueprint for sustainable funding of continuous horizontal global biosurveillance, future discussions of biopreparedness need to include experts in finance, ethics, and international politics in addition to biomedical scientists, clinicians, and product developers.\n",

The group asked the question, \u201cIs there a more effective way to quantify frailty that alerts us to whom will need close monitoring during flu season?\u201d\u2022Vaccines against influenza are beneficial because they modify infection outcomes in addition to preventing disease.\u2022Clinical trials of universal influenza vaccine candidates should implement a validated severity score for children and adults to capture the full value of the intervention. Can metrics that provide a severity score be developed and validated?\u2022If we can sustain multiyear clinical trials, then many important questions related to the natural history of influenza infection in a population can be addressed. For example, what is the relative efficacy in individuals with pre-existing immunity (natural or through seasonal vaccination) versus na\u00efve children? What is the impact of co-infection with other pathogens during an outbreak of influenza? Is it possible to achieve sustained protection by exposure to multiple strains over years?

The overall value of an animal model for the evaluation of drug and vaccine candidates requires high quality, well characterized and, preferably, standardized and validated assays and reagents and challenge materials.\u2022There is a spectrum of similarity between animal and human immune systems and responses to infection. These differences must be taken into account when interpreting pre-clinical data and making programmatic decisions based on the same.\u2022Animal models have been informative in dose selection for human studies. However, there remains variance across models and responses may over- or under-estimate what can be expected in humans (example \u2013 non-human primate responses to Ebola vaccine candidates over-estimated the human response).\u2022Inferring what a protective immune response in a human based on the natural infection of a pathogen-free animal can be precarious; this can be especially true when exploring correlates of protection. One may pay particular attention to differences in how a pathogen is delivered in nature (i.e., mosquito, superficial dermis, salivary proteins) and how this may or may not translate depending on how we deliver in the context of vaccination (i.e., needle, intramuscular or subcutaneous, no salivary proteins). Note added after review: Back correlations between efficacious vaccines and mechanisms of protection should be carried out to derive correlates of protection. Alternative approaches using in vitro organoids and ex vivo studies should be used to supplement live animal models, although their role in supporting product development is uncertain.\u2022Several other parameters of animal models can be poorly reflective of the human infection and disease experience. For example, the time course of infection in animal models can be remarkably different from humans. Further, lethal challenge models (e.g., Nipah) do not provide endpoints suitable for translation to clinical trials.\u2022Model relevance was also discussed in the context of a Zika pregnancy model in immunocompetent mice, in which the infected dams did not get viremia and there was no detectable vertical transmission of virus, yet there was virtually 100% fetal demise. Monoclonal antibody blocking studies indicated that, despite the absence of productive infection, the pathology was apparently caused by virus, raising the possibility of fetal demise due to specific placental pathology [7].\u2022There would be great value in developing high quality, standardized animal models and challenge strains of particular pathogens that are broadly accepted. Following Good Laboratory Practices within high bio-containment required for handling some pathogens is difficult and could impact countermeasure development efforts in these areas. Note added after review: Emphasis should be placed on working with bio-containment labs to get as close to GLP compliance as possible.\u2022Once a candidate vaccine or drug has entered into clinical testing or has been proven safe and effective it would valuable to go back and assess how pre-clinical animal models supported or did not support informed programmatic decision making.\n",

            "text": "Session take home points\u2022Antigen drift leads to a multitude of issues that impact the assessment of the clinical benefit of a vaccine or an antibody therapy, including: (1) defining protective epitopes across many clinical isolates; (2) determining how to establish firm evidence of clinical relevance; (3) evaluating cross protection in animals and by use of monoclonal antibodies that mediate neutralization in vitro; and (4) being cognizant of the potential confounding effects on in vitro neutralization used to calibrate vaccine dosing. Japanese encephalitis vaccines are an example of this issue.\u2022The group felt there was little evidence for an important role of toxicology studies in modifying the development plan, however negative toxicology studies may support advancing candidates. Newer methods of assessing safety might include replacing traditional toxicology studies with innovative technologies such as \u201corgans on a chip,\u201d and imaging data rather than biodistribution.\u2022The animal rule is currently reserved for situations where efficacy is difficult or unlikely or there is a time sensitive window to prove in human phase 2b. To improve the effectiveness of the animal rule on a global scale, it was suggested that the U.S. will be the leader for \u201canimal rule\u201d while other regulators will await U.S. approval. It was suggested that consideration be given for a hybrid model\u2013how and what relevant animal data can be linked to or supplement human data.\u2022The use of immune biomarkers to evaluate clinical efficacy is considered an important time-saving step to demonstrate clinical benefit. This concept implies there is a functional attribute to an immune/protective response. Using immune markers to support an Accelerated Approval pathway is desirable, however there are many unanswered questions about the mechanism of protection for some vaccines. Neutralizing antibodies as correlate for many viruses have been shown to be unreliable in some cases (examples\u2013Ebola and dengue). It may be important to study survivor immune responses.\u2022There is a potential role for biomarkers to identify adverse events- for example, biomarkers could present an opportunity to predict reactogenicity to adjuvants.\u2022Passive immunization can be a valuable tool for establishing the role of antibody in protection and in determining seroprotective levels. For example, passive transfer in an arenavirus model was used to establish that both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies can be protective [8].\u2022Ethical challenges complicate placebo controlled testing of vaccines against life threatening infections as well as use of human challenge models. For example, use of randomized control trial (RCT) in the Ebola outbreak was highly controversial. Innovative approaches such as the stepped wedge method [9] and delayed ring vaccination [10] were taken to control the vaccine trials, and efficacy was successfully demonstrated.\u2022Incorporating human challenge models into vaccine development for Disease X with high mortality can be done given: availability of a partially attenuated vaccine virus or pseudotyped attenuated virus for challenge; operation under the consideration of \u201cdo no harm;\u201d and, in specific instances studying cross protection with an antigenically- related virus strategy in an emergency (example \u2013 use of approved Japanese encephalitis vaccine against the West Nile [11], [12], [13] or a chikungunya vaccine against o\u2032nyong nyong) [14].\u2022Licensure standards need to be established in order to accelerate approval of vaccines. Adopting the standard of substantial effectiveness and evidence (reasonable likelihood) of clinical benefit can be valuable. The FDA has shown willingness to grant licensure for pandemic influenza manufactured in a similar mechanism to the seasonal flu vaccines. Note added after review: However, manufacturing and facility requirements pose challenges associated with validating new processes and facilities.\u2022Vaccination of animals responsible for transmission of agents to humans can be a very effective tool to combat the spread of a pandemic, and therefore it is important to understand the natural history of the disease. Some examples were given where accessible animals play a role in amplification and could be vaccinated to interrupt a human outbreak (example \u2013 Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Nipah virus disease). Importantly, veterinary vaccines are faster and easier to develop, and the USDA grants a conditional approval pathway. Despite the success of this approach for control of rabies, wildlife vaccination remains virtually unexplored.\u2022We have many opportunities to learn from our experience. It is important to assess effectiveness and evidence of vaccine failures. There should be more efforts to make use of studying protection against subclinical or mild infections. Finding clues to correlates of protection from such cases can be used to focus development resources more effectively. Can we use Jennerian (cross reactive) vaccines in the event of an emergency (e.g., chikungunya vaccine vs. O\u2032nyong\u2032nyong or Japanese encephalitis vaccine vs. West Nile)?\u2022Note added after review: The Animal Rule is reserved for drugs and vaccines in which traditional and accelerated approval pathways are not possible, and is not directly related to a time-sensitive window to prove efficacy in phase 2b trials. Also preclinical toxicology studies may be useful when negative toxicology findings have affected the decision to pursue product development.\n",
