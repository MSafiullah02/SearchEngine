The beginning of estrus is called the time of the first acceptance. As ovulation and fertilization takes place from 1 to 3 days after the first acceptance, true embryonic age can be overestimated [1]. The age of various fetuses in the same litter also differs. A fetal age difference of about 1 day is the most probable and this fact may slightly affect the experimental data. The full gestation period of pigs have a mean about 114 days [1]. The day or date of gestation is referred hereafter as DG.",

Chorionic villi are loosely opposed to the maternal epithelium by microvillus interdigitation or even separated from it at areas known as areolae. In the early stages, there are as many as six layers separating the fetus from the maternal bloodstream. This includes maternal tissue (uterine endothelium, connective tissue and epithelium) and fetal chorion (trophoblasts, connective tissue and endothelium). With advancing gestation, however, some fetal capillaries penetrate the trophoblast and bring the vascular beds closer. Antibodies and large organic molecules, however, have never been shown to cross the placenta in the pig and the failure of the trophoblast to invade maternal tissues probably means that even small peptides including cytokines are not transferred to the fetus [3]. For these reasons, the immune system of the porcine fetus, colostrum-deprived newborns and colostrum-deprived piglets reared in a germ-free (GF) environment, can be considered to be immunologically virgin compared to rodents and humans and with blood devoid of maternal antibodies [4].",

For example, some strains of the porcine parvovirus or the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus have been reported to cross the placenta by an unknown mechanism [5]. Another example is Toxoplasma gondii that may infect fetuses via congenital infection [6]. In many cases, the infection of the immunologically virgin fetuses leads to death. Whether these results from their immature immune system or a maternal immune response that gains access to the fetus due to a damaged placental barrier is not entirely clear. Antibody repertoire studies indicated that the former is most probable because the immune response of survivors is fetus-specific and does not appear to involve maternal antibodies [5]. In any case, the fetal immune response in survivors is mostly weak and will only rise near birth when the fetal immune system is more competent.",

The hematopoietic system develops from those common stem cells that migrate into different location and seed primary hematopoietic organs. Hematopoietic activity in pigs occurs basically in three phases that are characterized by different locations that correspond to fetal morphogenesis. The first primary hematopoietic organ where stem cells develop is the yolk sac; this moves then to the fetal liver and finally to the bone marrow [8]. In the pig, hematopoiesis in the yolk sac can be detected as soon as at the 17 somite stage at DG16. By DG18, approximately 3 million hemocytoblasts and 10 million erythroid cells can be found in the yolk sac. However, the yolk sac is no longer functional by DG24\u201327 and hematopoietic activity afterwards is supported by the fetal liver where hematopoietic activity can be detected from DG20. Later on DG40, the bone marrow starts its hemapoietic activity and this organ serves from that time as a major hematopoietic organ throughout life [4], [8], [9]. The basic information about hematopoietic and lymphopoietic activities in different lymphoid organs during prenatal ontogeny is summarized in Table 1\n.",

This approach is applied because the frequency and function of different components of innate immunity in healthy animals is mostly independent of age. In any case, innate immunity of pigs consists of the similar components described for other mammals. The effector functions are realized through two major mechanisms: (a) the recruitment and activation of cellular components; including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) and (b) the release of a broad spectrum of extracellular mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, complement, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).",

The proportion of NK cells in various tissues is between 1 and 10% with a tendency to increase in number during fetal ontogeny [10]. The occurrence and the frequency of NK cells stabilize at about DG70 and remains approximately the same through birth into postnatal life. NK cells in adult conventional pigs represent maximally 15% of all lymphocytes. Functional studies show that killing is not observed before birth and is delayed in germ-free piglets [11], [12]. This suggests that NK cells exhibit some sort of maturation and probably need colonization and microbial flora for the development of their full functional capabilities.",

The first step in the generation of the antibody repertoire involves combinatorial joining of VH, DH and JH gene segments in the Ig heavy chain (HC) locus of precursor pro-B cells, a process called VDJH rearrangement. Cells that have productively rearranged their VDJs may further differentiate to the early pre-B cell stage (preB-I) in which the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR), consisting of the VDJ spliced to the IgM HC (called \u03bcHC) in association with surrogate light chain (SLC consisting \u03bb5 plus VpreB) and the signaling components Ig-\u03b1 and Ig-\u03b2, are expressed on the cell surface [20]. The functional pre-BCR delivers signals that stop further rearrangement in the HC locus and thus assure allelic exclusion. Further cellular differentiation to the late pre-B cell stage (preB-II) involves Ig light chain (LC) gene segment rearrangement (V\u03bb and V\u03ba jointed to JL) and replacement of the SLC with authentic an LC [16], [17].

Unlike LC locus, the HC locus can be rearranged only once because of the loss of recombination signal sequences during VDJH rearrangement and the non-tandem arrangement of VH, DH and JH segments in the HC locus. This phenomenon is particularly demonstrated in chickens and swine that have only a single JH\n[22], [23], [24]. B cells precursors that do not succeed in making a productive rearrangement using the first chromosome (theoretically 2/3 of all cells if the process is random) have only one more chance to generate a translatable \u03bcHC by using the second chromosome, again with a 67% chance to failure. B cell precursors that do not attain the pre-BI cell stage due to lack of a productive rearrangement are presumably eliminated. Thus, less than 55% of all precursor B cells that start the recombination process can express a \u03bcHC and these survivors will have frequencies of in-frame and out-of-frame rearrangements of \u223c71% and \u223c29%, respectively.",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that B cell lymphogenesis operates by the same mechanism regardless of the type of tissue where primary B cell lymphogenesis occurs. Data from swine counter this conviction and show that certain B cell populations from fetal tissues do not fulfill the textbook description of B cell lymphogenesis that yields 71% productive rearrangements [8], [25]. Rather, fetal B cells coming from the yolk sac and fetal liver in the first wave of progenitors result in B cells in which 100% carry productive rearrangement on one allele and no rearrangement on the second (Fig. 3A\u2013D). On the other hand, B cells arising from the second wave of progenitors that originates in the bone marrow follow the established paradigm and are not limited in progressive VDJ rearrangement on second chromosome (Fig. 3E\u2013G). These observations suggest that either different rearrangement mechanisms or different selection mechanisms operate outside the bone marrow [8]. Based on in vitro experiments, the influence of the bone marrow environment on selection of productive heavy chain rearrangements has also been suggested in mice [26]. However, no direct proof has been provided from studies in mice because maturation of mice B cells in fetal liver coincides with maturation in bone marrow and therefore mixture of cells originating from both sources contributes to the overall B cell pool. This makes further analysis of VDJ status on different chromosomes impossible. In any case, detailed sequence analysis of the fetal VDJH repertoire in swine does not reveal any significant age- or tissue-dependent changes in VDJH diversity during fetal life (i.e., VH and DH usage, number of N-region additions, number of somatic mutation and extend of CDR3 diversity). The limited single VDJH rearrangement on one allele is the only difference that distinguishes early B cells from yolk sac and fetal liver from those later recovered from bone marrow. Whether these represent developmentally distinct B cell subsets as described for B-1 and B-2 cells in mice remains to be determined because porcine B cells cannot yet be distinguished by flow cytometry. In any event, the limitation in progressive VDJ rearrangement on the second chromosome in early fetal B cells as evidenced in swine, is similar to development of B cells in chickens and rabbits that have all their VDJ rearrangements in-frame. All B cells in these species are generated during a narrow window in fetal life and are thereafter maintained through life by mitosis and somatic diversification in the chicken bursa [23] and the rabbit appendix [27].",

Given: (a) the limited combinatorial diversity in this swine where 7 major VH genes are used in fetal development and only two DH (DHA and DHB) and one JH segments exist and (b) the nearly identical framework regions of its VH3-like genes, >95% of the pre-immune repertoire in swine is determined by junctional diversity in CDR3. The light chain repertoire is also combinatorially restricted and shows little or no junctional diversity [30]. Lambda is preferentially used in early B cell development; presumably because of \u03bb5. Otherwise the expressed \u03ba:\u03bb ratio is very similar to humans and therefore very different from the heavily skewed ratios in rodents, rabbits, cattle and horses.

            "text": "There is no pan-B cell marker for swine other than intracellular CD79\u03b1 detected by cross-reactive anti-human monoclonal antibodies [31]. Because identification is restricted to intracellular staining, many studies are done using anti-\u03bcHC antibodies that detect all Ig positive cells, thus omitting plasma cells, some switched B cells and B cell precursors from detection. Analysis by this approach showed that all \u03bcHC+ B cells in swine are MHC-II+, CD25lo and CD45RC+\n[10]. Fetal studies showed that virtually all immature \u03bcHC+ B cells are also CD21+ and CD2lo\n[8], [10], [32]. CD2 and CD21 molecules can be expressed differentially so the mature B cells are subdivided into four subpopulations that include CD2+CD21+, CD2\u2212CD21+, CD2+CD21\u2212 and CD2\u2212CD21\u2212 cells [33]. Because the numbers of CD2\u2212 and CD21\u2212 B lymphocytes significantly increases in germ-free animals that were colonized by a complex intestinal microflora or just with the age of conventional animals [32], these markers were considered a B cell differentiation marker in pigs. Our recent data showed that CD2 but not CD21 can be re-expressed on the surface of B cells so that only CD21 can be considered a maturation marker (Fig. 4\n). The function of CD2 on the surface of B cells is not known but CD2 is an adhesion molecule that acts during intercellular interactions so it can be down-regulated by cell-to-cell contact. Once B cells recover from such interactions, CD2 expression on B cells is re-established in a short period. CD2 may also be regarded as a developmental marker because porcine B cell precursors express CD2 earlier than the BCR during B lymphopoiesis [32], [34]. In this respect, expression of CD25, CD79\u03b1 and CD172a can be also used for identification of B cell precursors in primary lymphopoietic centers [23]. Cross-reactive CD20 and CD86 were also recently showed to be useful for phenotyping of porcine B cells [35].",

Transcripts for IgG1, IgG2, and IgA and of course IgM are presented at midgestation [5], [28]. Furthermore, de novo synthesized IgG, IgM and IgA are present in fetal sera at low levels during the second half of gestation [5]. Remarkably, IgG and IgA plasma cells are present in the thymic medulla during the same period [5]. In newborn piglets, IgE is also transcribed in thymus [37]. Probably, the CSR is a programmed event in fetal piglets, independent of antigen and perhaps the result of an intrinsic stochastic phenomenon that occurs spontaneously. The porcine thymus in these regards plays a considerable role and is a prominent site for the transcription of IgG and IgA switched isotypes during prenatal life [5], [40]. Whether this is a result of preferential accumulation of plasma cells in the thymus or whether the thymus environment is responsible for spontaneous switching, remains to be determined. The ratio of IgG to IgA secreting cells in thymus is nearly equal, whereas the serum IgG to IgA ratio from the same animals is \u223c10:1. Thus, it appears that IgG: (a) must be secreted at a greater rate, (b) accumulates in the blood vascular system because IgA is preferentially transported to mucosal sites, (c) has a longer half-life because of protection by FcRn, (d) is in part derived from maternal blood or (e) is synthesized in large amounts outside of thymus. In any case, the reason why the epicenter for isotype switch recombination is the fetal thymus and why plasma cells accumulate in this organ and why serum IgG and IgA levels do not agree with IgG and IgA cell numbers is unexplained.",

            "text": "The porcine thymus is interesting also by occurrence of VDJ rearrangements that are apparently not selected for productive rearrangement. CDR3 length analysis of crude thymus lysate (Fig. 3H) expresses the total absence of selection for productive (in-frame) rearrangements [23], [29]. IgM+ B cells (Fig. 5\n) are present within porcine thymus in the same frequencies as known for other species and constitute \u223c1% from all thymocytes [14]. Recent findings showed that these B cells are similar to IgM+ B cells found in the periphery and other lymphatic organs being CD2lo MHC-II+ CD45RC+ and CD25lo. Because thymic IgM+ B cells express functional IgM on the cell surface and therefore are selected for productive rearrangements, these B cells cannot contribute to unselected VDJ repertoire found in the thymus. The same conclusion applies for plasma cells (Fig. 5) that produce switched IgG and IgA. Both, plasma cells and \u03bcHC+ B cells are found exclusively in the thymic medulla (Fig. 5). Site-specific PCR on clusters of cells together with CDR3 length analysis also described a small population of developing B cells that can be found in thymic cortex (Fig. 5). These cells are Ig negative and have the characteristics of B cells that have gone through a selection process, similar to B cell in the bone marrow. These cells may be indicative of lymphogenesis in the thymus which also does not contribute to the unselected B cell repertoire. Micromanipulation experiments and single-cell PCR found a specific and abundant population of cells in thymic inter-capsular layer that are responsible for unselected VDJH repertoire (Fig. 5). These cells contains rearranged VDJH that are entirely unaffected by the mechanism governing the selection of in-frame VDJH rearrangement. Although thymus is not remarkable producer of B cells at all, different population of thymic cells containing VDJH rearrangement clearly demonstrate that differences in the microenvironment at different sites control B cell selection. The thymus is a specific example of this process and its architecture provides specific microenvironments that could allow for distinctive selection and differentiation of B cells.",

Maturation within this group begins with proliferation of the CD2+CD8\u2212CD1+CD45RC\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 common precursor (Fig. 6\n). This developmental stage is followed by diversification into the CD2\u2212CD8\u2212, CD2+CD8\u2212 and CD2+CD8\u03b1+ subsets (Fig. 6). The further maturation of each subset is accompanied by a loss of expression of CD1 and by increased expression of CD45RC in a mutually exclusive fashion (Fig. 6). Therefore, individual \u03b3\u03b4 subsets develop from immature CD1+CD45RC\u2212 through intermediate CD1\u2212CD45RC\u2212 into mature CD1\u2212CD45RC+ cells. This indicates that each of the three CD4\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 thymocyte subsets defined by CD2 and CD8\u03b1 expression develop in thymus through separate differentiation pathways and are exported from the thymus independently [33], [43]. It follows that all TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells subsets develop in the thymus and that expression of CD2 and/or CD8 are not useful differentiation markers for \u03b3\u03b4 thymocyte lineage. The last two subpopulation of intermediate and mature \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are exported from thymus into the periphery where the final maturation step from CD1\u2212CD45RC\u2212 into CD1\u2212CD45RC+ cells may also occur. All of these findings indicate that the maturation and phenotype alteration of \u03b3\u03b4 thymocytes occurs after successful expression of TCR\u03b3\u03b4.",

Thus, these cells may alter their lineage program by re-entering the cell cycle and re-activating TCR\u03b1\u03b2 gene rearrangement. It is noteworthy that CD4+CD8+ \u03b3\u03b4 thymocytes also occur infrequently in humans [44], and early and transiently during fetal development in mice [45], [46]. A very minor subpopulation has also been reported in chickens [47]. CD4+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can also be obtained in substantial numbers from human fetal liver after in vitro stimulation [48], [49].

            "text": "Peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in swine may be subdivided into CD2\u2212CD8\u2212, CD2+CD8\u2212 and CD2+CD8+ subsets [10], [51], correspondingly to the group of CD4\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 thymocytes. There are no CD4+ and/or CD1+ and/or CD8\u03b1\u03b2+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the periphery [43]. Individual subsets of peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T cells differ in their homing characteristic which is evident in early ontogeny and extends up to adulthood; CD2+CD8+ and CD2+CD8\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells preferentially accumulate in the spleen while CD2\u2212CD8\u2212 are enriched in the circulation [10], [50], [51]. The same phenotype-dependent pattern of tissue distribution has not been identified in mice or humans although CD2+CD8\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as well as \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expressing CD8 or lacking CD2 molecules have been observed and mucosal \u03b3\u03b4 T cells show a distinctive pattern of TCR\u03b3\u03b4 gene usage and phenotype that distinguishes them from the peripheral blood pool [44], [45], [46]. The porcine CD2+CD8\u03b1+ subset has been postulated to be the progeny of peripheral CD2+CD8\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes. This conclusion is based on the observation that: (a) some TCR\u03b3\u03b4+CD8\u2212 cells may acquire CD8 upon activation [52], (b) that CD2+CD8\u03b1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are potentially cytotoxic while other TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ cell subsets are not [53], [54] and that (c) CD2+CD8\u03b1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cell are scarce in porcine fetuses [10]. CD8\u03b1 is expressed on \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells following activation, on a subset of NK cells that are directly cytotoxic, on a subset of effector dendritic cells, and on many intra-epithelial lymphocytes from conventional but not from germ-free animals [55], [56], [57], [58]. In swine, in contrast to humans and mice, CD8\u03b1 and/or MHC-II are not down-regulated so the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell maintain the expression of these entities after activation [33], [43], [59]. This eventually leads to two developmentally distinct subsets of CD2+CD8\u03b1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the periphery. One develops in the thymus while the second acquires CD8\u03b1 extrathymically as a result of activation of CD8\u2212 thymus-dependent precursors [33]. These two developmentally distinct population of CD2+CD8\u03b1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be monitored by MHC-II expression, so that thymic-derived CD8\u03b1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes are MHC-II\u2212 while those derived in the periphery are MHC-II+. It should be mentioned that the expression of CD8\u03b1 and MHC-II molecules after activation is mutually independent thus CD2\u2212CD8\u2212 as well as CD2+CD8\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may also express MHC-II after activation. Absence of activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell during fetal life is a reason for almost exclusive absence of MHC-II+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in embryos [33], [43]. The activation of CD8\u03b1 expression on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the periphery cannot be ascribed and should not be confused with extra-thymic maturation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells because this secondary peripheral maturation does not involve the rearrangement of TCR\u03b3\u03b4 genes and the genesis of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells de novo. More likely, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells just alter their accessory molecules to change the surface phenotype and function.",

However, activation of CD4+CD8\u2212 helper \u03b1\u03b2 T cells with various antigens in the periphery leads to expression of CD8\u03b1 that plays an important role in signal transduction associated with cell effector function. As mentioned for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [33], [43], the expression of CD8\u03b1 and MHC-II molecules in pigs is permanent and these activation molecules are not down-regulated after activation [59]. This results in the occurrence so-called \u201cperipheral double-positive \u03b1\u03b2 T cells\u201d that form the effector/memory T cell pool [10], [14], [53], [61], [62]. Again, it is important to emphasize that these extrathymically derived subsets are not connected and should not be confused with transitional DP stages of intrathymic development because the former are always CD8\u03b1+\n[53], CD1\u2212\n[61], mostly CD29+\n[62], MHC-II+\n[10], [61] and are generated from their CD8\u2212 counterparts upon stimulation [62]. The occurrence of peripheral CD4+CD8\u03b1\u03b2+ \u03b1\u03b2 T cells is dependent on external antigenic stimuli and thus this subset is absent or very rare before birth and among newborns [10], [14].",

The B cell pool is also immature and consists of a uniform batch of unprimed B cells that are CD2+CD21+\n[8], [10], [23]. All of these factors result in a systemic as well as a mucosal adaptive immune system in the neonatal piglet that is primitive compared to adult pigs [63].

This phenomenon is particularly evident in experiments using isolator piglets raised in germ-free conditions. In such animals, relatively little development of the immune system occurs in comparison with conventional littermates of the same age [10], [39], [64], [65]. Moreover, germ-free animals are even unable to mount antibody responses to model T-dependent or T-independent antigens in contrast to colonized isolator piglets [66].

At the B cells level, priming results in loss of CD2 expression [32], [34]. The resultant CD2\u2212 CD21+ B cells without further stimulation rapidly re-express CD2 on their surface but once stimulated, they proliferate and mature into CD21\u2212 B cell compartment. CD21\u2212 B cells, either CD2+ or CD2\u2212 are able to generate proliferating uHC\u2212 plasmablast or non-proliferating uHC\u2212 plasma cells that are terminal stages of B cell maturation [34], [65]. Also remarkable is the divergence of the pattern antibody repertoire in that \u223c80% of all VH genes in conventional pigs are no longer identifiable as one of the seven VH genes that comprise >95% of the pre-immune repertoire because they have undergone somatic hyper-mutations [28].",
