A variety of nanoparticles (NPs) with various shapes such as spheres, nanotubes, nanohorns and nanocages, made of different materials, from organic dendrimers, liposomes, gold, carbon, semiconductors, silicon to iron oxide, have already been fabricated and explored in many scientific fields, including chemistry, material sciences, physics, medicine and electronics [1], [2], [3]. At the nanoscale, the physical, chemical, and biological properties of materials differ fundamentally and often, unexpectedly, from their corresponding bulk counter part because of the quantum size effect, e.g. gold and silver nanoparticles are characterized by their ability to strongly absorb the visible light at definite wavelengths which depend on the size and the shape of the nanoparticles [4] whereas the absorption of visible light in a large range from quantum dots induces the emission of visible light whose wavelength increases with the size of the nanoparticles [5].",

The approach involves polymerization of functional monomers and a cross-linker around a print molecule. Once the template was extracted, receptor sites are present in the material with functional and shape complementary to the template. Today's concept of molecular imprinting has been widely recognized as the most promising methodology for the preparation of different tailor-made materials with selective binding. Due to their high selectivity, mechanical strength, resistance against acids, bases, organic solvents, and high pressures and temperatures, as well as the low cost and ease for preparation, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were developed for extensive applications such as solid phase extraction (SPE), chromatography, enzymatic catalysis, and sensor technology [22], [23], [24].",

The morphological and magnetic characteristics of the M-MIP were characterized by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and vibrating sample magnetometry. The magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were modified with methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MAPS) in order to provide surface polymerizable functional groups. The template, the functional monomer (2-vinylpyridine, 2-VP), the cross-linking monomer (ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, EGDMA) and Fe3O4@MAPS were mixed. After ultrasonication, addition of a sodium dodecylsulphate solution and degassing, the initiator (azo-bis-isobutyronitrile, AIBN) was added. The resulting polymeric microspheres were washed and the template molecules removed by Soxhlet extraction. These multifunctional nanoparticles were used in a molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction approach assisted by magnetic separation to extract BPA from environmental water and milk samples. High-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection was employed to determine BPA after the extraction. For water samples, the developed method exhibited a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 ng L\u22121, a relative standard deviation of 2.7% (intraday), and spiked recoveries ranging from 89% to 106%. For milk samples, the LOD was 0.16 \u03bcg L\u22121, recoveries ranged from 95% to 101%, and BPA was found in four samples at levels of 0.45\u20130.94 \u03bcg L\u22121. Authors concluded that the method not only provided a rapid and reliable analysis but it also overcame problems with conventional solid-phase extraction (SPE), such as the packing of the SPE column and the time-consuming nature of the process of loading large-volume samples.",

Macrocyclic hosts such as crown ethers, cryptands, cyclophanes, calixarenes and cucurbiturils have been synthesized and received much attention, opening a wide range of opportunities for new supramolecular chemistry and materials. Among them, cyclodextrins (CDs) are the most important and promising macrocyclic hosts because they are water-soluble natural products, inexpensive, commercially available, non-toxic and readily functionalized [30], [31], [32]. Cyclodextrins (CD), composed of six (\u03b1), seven (\u03b2), or eight (\u03b3) d-glucopyranose units, possess truncated cone-shaped hydrophobic cavities, which are capable of binding various organic, inorganic, and biological molecules to form stable host\u2013guest inclusion complexes in aqueous solution. Each CD has its own ability to form host\u2013guest inclusion complexes with specific guest molecules, an ability which depends on a proper fit of the guest molecule into the hydrophobic CD cavity. The principal advantages of natural CDs as recognition moieties are: (1) a well-defined chemical structure, yielding many potential sites for chemical modification; (2) the availability of CDs of different cavity sizes; (3) low toxicity and (4) the protection of the included molecule from biodegradation and quenching (when dealing with luminescent molecules). These properties are also expected to be useful in the assembly of magnetic nanosystems.",

The multifunctional nanoparticles were then physically and chemically characterized. Authors applied the system to the detection of dopamine in water solution by dispersing the multifunctional nanoparticles in the aqueous solution containing dopamine to form the inclusion complex. Then, the magnetic nanoparticles, using an external magnet, were absorbed onto ITO (indium tin oxide) for the electrochemical detection of dopamine. Results demonstrated that due to both the electrocatalytic effect of the magnetic nanoparticles and the host\u2013guest effect of \u03b2-CD, dopamine could be detected with high sensitivity.",

The egg-white glycoprotein avidin and its non-glycosylated bacterial analogue streptavidin are two evolutionarily unrelated proteins that bind the vitamin biotin with remarkably high affinity constants (K\nd\n = 10\u221215\n M\u22121). The bond formation between biotin and avidin/streptavidin is very rapid and, once formed, is unaffected by pH, organic solvents and other denaturing agents. Both, avidin and streptavidin, have essentially irreversible biotin-binding properties since bound biotin can only be released by denaturing the subunits of the proteins. These unique features are the basis of avidin/streptavidin-biotin technology, which has evolved into a universal tool in various fields of the biological and analytical sciences [34], [35], [36], [37]. Some notable differences exist between these two proteins. Avidin is a glycoprotein and contains one disulphide bridge and two methionine residues, whereas streptavidin is non-glycosylated and devoid of any sulphur containing residues. Whereas avidin bears a single tyrosine residue, the content of tyrosine residues in streptavidin is relatively high (six per subunit).",

Recently, Hafaid et al. [38] have explored the development of impedimetric immunosensors based on magnetic iron nanoparticles functionalized with streptavidin to which a biot-tag anti-D-dimer reduced antibody (Fab fragment Biot-ScAc) was bound using a biotin-streptavidin interaction. SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) analysis showed a deviation on the measured angle during antigen-antibody recognition whereas label free detection using by EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) allowed monitoring variation of polarization resistance. Compared to immobilization of antibody on bare gold surface using aminodecanethiol SAM (Self Assembled Monolayers), antibody immobilization on magnetic nanoparticles permitted to reach lower detection limits for the antigen: 500 pg mL\u22121 instead of 1 ng mL\u22121 to in the case of EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) and 300 ng mL\u22121 instead of 4.5 \u03bcg mL\u22121 in the case of SPR. Thus, the approach permitted to improve the sensitivity: from 257.3 \u03a9 cm2\n \u03bcg\u22121\n mL to 1871 \u03a9 cm2\n \u03bcg\u22121\n mL in the case of EIS and from 0.003 \u03bcg\u22121\n mL to 0.094 \u03bcg\u22121\n mL in the case of SPR. According to the authors the use of the iron oxide nanoparticles amplified the response signal, due to an increase in the thickness of the layer of antibody from 0.4 to 1.2 nm, from where, an increase of the grafting density of antibody on the surface resulted in larger amounts of antigen linked to the specific sites [38].",

An electrochemical nucleic acid sensor system composed of a disposable graphite sensor, pencil graphite electrode (PGE) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used for measurement of guanine oxidation signals in solutions containing no target, the complementary target, a single-base mismatch target, and non-complementary target oligonucleotides. A significant guanine oxidation signal was observed with the complementary target due to complete hybridization, while with single-base mismatch target, the signal at the same conditions was negligible. In the case of the non-complementary target, there was also a low mean signal (due to non-specific interactions).

Based on the structure and synthesis strategies, the authors classified fluorescent/magnetic nanocomposites in eight types: (i) a magnetic core coated with a silica shell containing fluorescent components; (ii) polymer-coated magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with a fluorescent moiety; (iii) ionic aggregates consisting of a magnetic core and fluorescent ionic compounds; (iv) fluorescently labelled bilipid-coated magnetic nanoparticles; (v) a magnetic core covalently bound to a fluorescent entity via a spacer; (vi) a magnetic core directly coated with a semiconducting shell; (vii) magnetically doped QDs and (viii) nanocomposites, which consist from magnetic nanoparticles and QDs encapsulated within a polymer or silica matrix. Authors concluded that, despite of all recent progress made, the fluorescent-magnetic nanocomposite area is still in its infant stage and significant efforts are needed for further development of these materials and their utilization.",

As illustrated in Fig. 3\n, sodium yttrium fluoride, co-doped with ytterbium and erbium, was co-precipitated on iron oxide nanoparticles in the presence of a chelator, EDTA. The magnetic nanoparticles were so coated with an up-converting phosphor shell. The magnetic/fluorescent nanoparticles were then coated with an amino-silane layer and, after activation with glutaraldehyde, the particles were covalently coupled with streptavidin. Protein arrays were used to confirm the successful binding of streptavidin. Authors demonstrated the success of streptavidin immobilization on the hybrid nano-particle by its specific binding with an array of biotinylated IgG spots on a glass slide. A home-built CCD biochip scanner with an external 980 nm laser and an infrared filter were used to detect the infrared-to-visible up-conversion fluorescence on the glass slide. Signal from positive control spots assured the working state of the glass slide and scanner, whereas the absence of any signal from negative control spots demonstrated that non-specific absorption was low. Up-conversion fluorescence signal from the biotinylated IgG spots came from streptavidin-coated hybrid nanoparticles bound to the glass slide through the specific biotin/streptavidin interaction. Authors conclude that (a) these streptavidin-coated up-conversion fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles can be readily coupled with bio-molecules such as antibodies, proteins and nucleic acids, etc., via streptavidin/biotin interaction and (b) they are potentially useful in a variety of areas because they can be simultaneously manipulated with an external magnetic field and characterized in situ using fluorescence microscopy or confocal scanning microscopy.",

Results showed that non-specific adsorption of the nanoparticles was negligible: after free fluorescent nanoparticles were incubated with HeLa cells, fluorescence microscopy and time resolved fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that no nanoparticles were inside the cells. On the contrary, the labelled transferrin fluorescent nanoparticles incubated with HeLa cells were transported into them via the transferrin\u2013transferrin receptor interaction on the cell surface and the receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Although sodium citrate is the most common reducing agent, metal nanoparticles can also be synthesized by the use of borohydride and other reducing agents [77], [78]. Particles synthesized by citrate reduction are nearly monodisperse spheres of a size controlled by the initial reagent concentrations. They have a negative surface charge as a consequence of a weakly bound citrate coating and are easily characterized by their plasmon absorbance band (at about 520 nm for 15 nm particles).

This approach makes use of sulphur containing ligands, e.g. thiol, disulphide and thiolester. Goodman and Rotello [83] have reviewed monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles in the multivalent binding of biomolecular targets and their role as a design element for particle-target recognition, in the development of advanced model systems and in catalysis. Although the affinity between the gold and silica is weaker than those between magnetic nanoparticles or quantum dots and silica, covering of AuNPs with silica as starting point for further functionalization is also possible. To afford this, an anchor precursor such as \u03b3-trimethoxysilyilpropylmethacrylate (MPTS) or APTEOS is required for the surface targeted growth of silica on gold nanoparticles [84], [85] and then, the hydrolysis of TEOS (or other alkoxysilane precursor) through either the sol\u2013gel technology or the reverse micro emulsion method is performed to form a second silica layer. Although the silica shell may prevent the aggregation of AuNPs, so far, the application of the gold\u2013silica hybrid in analytical approaches is limited. In the following, we provide an overview of recent examples of multifunctional AuNPs-based assays. Recently, Chang et al.

The binding of flavin to diaminopyridine by hydrogen bonding was enhanced by a close pyrene unit, which should provide an additional binding interaction by aromatic stacking. Pyrene and diaminopyridine moieties were randomly distributed over the AuNPs surface and hence not necessarily close enough to show a synergistic binding effect for flavin: However, over a 73 h time period a rearrangement of the binding sites (random surface diffusion of the pyrene and diaminopyridine units) took place, giving rise to a 71% increase in the binding constant. The slow rearrangement suggested that it is not simply the thiol chains moving in space to maximize interactions, but actual movement of the bound chains on the particle surface to maximize the free energy of the system. This was an important advance which may lead to the development of a new approach to artificial receptor design similar to molecular imprinting [84]. It also confirms that multifunctional AuNPs are dynamic systems that do not only readily undergo ligand place exchange reactions but are also capable of remarkable re-organisation processes in their ligand shell.",

When the donor fluorophore is in its excited state, the energy is transferred via a non-radiative long-range dipole-dipole coupling mechanism (energy transfer, FRET) to the acceptor quencher which is in close proximity (typically <10 nm) to it. Consequently, the fluorophore/quencher pair is normally in the \u201cfluorescence off\u201d state. In the presence of the target (complementary) DNA, the stem-loop unfolds and the fluorophore/quencher switchs to the \u201cfluorescence on\u201d state (see Fig. 8\n). The use of MBs as fluorescent signaling mechanism offers several advantages [100]: (i) the light-up signaling mechanism allows MBs to perform highly sensitive detection and monitoring of nucleic acids in real time. This detection-without-separation approach is particularly useful in those situations where it is either impossible or undesirable to extract the probe\u2013target hybrids from an excess of the unbound probes; (ii) their relatively high signal-to-background ratio, providing higher sensitivity of detection compared to other conventional fluorescent probes. Upon hybridization to its target, a well-designed MB can generate as high as 200-fold fluorescence enhancement under optimal conditions; (iii) MBs are extraordinarily target-specific and are able to differentiate as low as single-mismatched base pair sequences.

When the molecular quencher is replaced with Au NPs, the quenching is much more efficient, resulting in a more sensitive probe. So, Dubertret et al. [101] used a 3\u2032-amino-5\u2032-thiol-modified ssDNA oligomer to anchor the probe oligonucleotide to commercially available 1.4-nm gold clusters containing a single maleimido group in their ligand shell and subsequent coupling with an amino-reactive fluorophore. This construct resulted in a quenched loop conformation that could be opened by hybridization, resulting in a fluorescence increase. The analytical performance of the hybrid molecular beacon was optimized by determining the quenching efficiency (QE) for several dyes. The QE was defined as the difference in fluorescence between the open duplex and the intramolecularly closed beacon. The best QE value (ca. 99.5%) was obtained for rhodamine 6G, indicating that the fluorescence signal of the beacon increased about 200-fold upon hybridization with the complementary target. The gold-oligomer-dye hybrids were applied to the detection of single mismatches in DNA and competitive hybridization assays revealed that the ability to detect single base mutations was about 8-fold greater than with conventional molecular beacons while the sensitivity of detection was enhanced up to 100-fold [101], [102].",

The AuNPs function as both a nano-scaffold and a nano-quencher (efficient energy acceptor). This hybrid bio/inorganic construct was found to spontaneously assemble into a constrained arch-like conformation on the particle surface and binding of target molecules resulted in a conformational change, which restored the fluorescence of the quenched fluorophore. Unlike conventional molecular beacons with a stem-and-loop structure, the nanoparticle probes did not require a stem.

Oligonucleotides were designed complementary to a target sequence of interest containing a 3\u2032 universal fluorescent dye (TAMRA, 5-(and-6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester) and a 5\u2032 thiol caused the oligonucleotides to self-assemble onto the metal nanowire. The single-stranded oligonucleotide contained a self-complementary hairpin stem sequence of 10 bases that forced the 3\u2032 fluorophore to come into contact with the metallic nanowire surface, thereby quenching the fluorescence. By using differently encoded nanowires, each conjugated with a different oligonucleotide sequence, multiplexed DNA assays were possible using a single fluorophore, from a multiplexed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Decoding of the nanowire striping pattern indicated which DNA sequence was present.",

Authors were able to load approximately 44 nucleotides bearing different coloured fluorophores onto a single large gold nanoparticle. Each colour of fluorophore (FAM, Cy5 or Rox) targets a specific tumour-suppressor gene (p16, p21 or p53). The multicolour beacon produced the characteristic fluorescence when it bound to the designed targets: p16 produced the blue colour of FAM emission, p21 produced the red of Cy5 and p53 produced the orange of Rox.

The challenge is to find a dye that have ideal quenching properties, but without interfering with the analytical determination. Also, factors that influence molecular beacon surface coverage on metal nanoparticles and the impact of coverage on beacon performance in hybridization assays is another challenge as surface attachment of MBs would enable not only a wide range of surface-based transduction strategies (optical, electrochemical), but also spatial arraying, substantially increasing the degree of multiplexing possible [106].

In fact, the presence of the analyte can quench or enhance the nanocrystal luminescence, depending on the functionalization strategy. Several approaches have been performed to use QDs as sensors for metal ions. In a recent paper by Ruedas-Rama et al. it was reported the development of multi-ion sensing using different combinations of QDs with selected ionophores or organic fluorophores embedded in a polymeric composite material [134]. In their approach, authors explored the differences in efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between QDs and proximal organic dyes using a single excitation wavelength in order to discriminate ion sensitive emission signals. Co-immobilization of green emitting QDs with lucigenin, or valinomycin and a selected chromoionophore in acrylic nanospheres, resulted in Cl2 sensitive and K+ selective sensors, respectively. Embedding the resulting nanospheres in a polymeric matrix, dual sensitive ionic sensors with no cross-talk were created. In the presence of K+ and Cl2 the fluorescence of lucigenin was quenched, and QDs act as donors interacting with the deprotonated chromoionophore (acceptor) by FRET. As each ion was sensed by a different independent mechanism, the resulting luminescent response of the nanocomposite allowed monitoring the presence of each one of the analytes in different spectral regions in an independent manner.",

In their approach, peptides were synthesized to have domains specific for QD attachment, structural rigidity, protease recognition properties and dye labeling. In this initial state, fluorescence from the QD was significantly quenched by the dye. As an appropriate enzyme was added to solution some of the peptides were cleaved resulting in a substantial increase in fluorescence signal (dyes diffused away from the QD surface). Authors indicated that by altering the recognition sequence (consisting of 2\u20134 selected amino acid residues) the \u201cnanosensor\u201d could be tuned to respond to a specific enzyme. Multifunctional QDs are also highly suited to sense more complex chemical species. In a relatively recent work, Potyrailo and co-workers [136] explored the use of different sized TOPO (tri-n-octylphosphine oxide) capped CdSe QDs incorporated into a polymer film. Upon photo activation, CdSe nanocrystals exhibited distinct photoluminescence response patterns when the film exposed to polar and non-polar vapors in air By using principal component analyses (PCA) of the spectral response of a multi QD doped film, a selective gas sensor was obtained, thus introducing the possibility of multi parameter gas sensing. The principle was demonstrated by exposing a PMMA (polymethylmetharcrylate) film doped with CdSe QDs (average sizes 2.8 nm and 5.6 nm diameter) to different concentrations of methanol and toluene. Results demonstrated that responses of the sensor film to the different vapors were well-separated in the PCA space, allowing for easy discrimination. This approach provides a complementary alternative to solvatochromic sensors based on chromo- and fluorescent dyes with benefits that include higher photo stability and sensitivity.",

Another interesting review by Rao et al.

Anodized aluminum oxide membranes (with pore diameters ranging from 20 to 200 nm and with lengths up to 90 \u03bcm) were used as templates for CNT growth. These membranes were immersed in acidic solutions containing the corresponding Au or iron nanoparticles which adhered electrostatically to the template walls.

Experimental results demonstrated that Raman spectra of CVD carbon nanotubes with and without Au nanoparticles showed no significant difference. However, it was interesting to observe that while addition of CNTs without Au particles to a glycine solution yielded no Raman signal changes, signal enhancements were achieved only with nanotubes with gold particles embedded in the walls. Authors explained this enhancement suggesting that the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal for glycine was due uniquely to glycine molecules close to the Au nanoparticles, which were mainly inside the nanotube. The concentration of glycine in the solution was too low to be observed by the conventional Raman technique and, consequently, glycine outside the nanotube cannot yield any signal. Comparison of these results to SERS of glycine in an Au colloid solution showed an up shift of about 5\u201310 cm\u22121 of the glycine peaks, possibly due to the presence of the carbon layer between the gold and the glycine. Authors highlighted that these results open the way to the development of nanotube based SERS probes for the detection of extremely small amounts of biological and chemical components dispersed in liquids or cellular research. On the other hand, application of CNTs functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles was not analytically assayed. However, Gogotsi et al. [166] claimed that a key advantage of the CNTs modified with magnetic nanoparticles was that the cavity of the CNT was empty and that fact could allow CNT alignment in the presence of a magnetic field without interfering with fluid flow inside the CNTs. These magnetically active tubes could also be manipulated through magnetic assembly in micro- and nanodevices or loaded with drugs, driven to a specific location inside a cell or used for biosensing. In the magnetic nanotubes synthesized in their work, metal particles were always covered by a carbon layer which did not allow direct chemical reaction or loss of particles in the environment.",

Such combination produced an electrocatalytic system capable of effective reduction of oxygen in acid medium (0.5 mol L\u22121 H2SO4). The simultaneous presence of cobalt porphyrin and tungsten oxide, together with dispersed carbon nanotubes, led to an enhancement effect evident from positive shifting in the oxygen reduction voltammetric potential and a significant increase of voltammetric currents (relative to those characteristic of the system free of carbon nanotubes and WO3). The multi-component electrocatalytic film also exhibited relatively higher activity towards reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Authors suggested that the reduction of oxygen was initiated at the cobalt porphyrin redox centres, and the undesirable hydrogen peroxide intermediate was further reduced at the tungsten oxide support. An important function of carbon nanotubes was to improve transport of electrons within the electrocatalytic multi-component film. Although authors recognized that the performance of Co-porphyrin/WO3/CNTs catalyst was lower in comparison to Pt-based systems, their system was largely ethanol tolerant, a fact of particular importance where highly selective cathode electrocatalysts were required such as in applications in fuel cells utilizing alcohols.",

While covalent functionalization of inorganic oxide nanotubes is a relatively easy task, layered chalcogenides are much more inert because of the sulphur lone electron pairs pointing away from the surfaces, while the metal is sandwiched by the chalcogen layers and, therefore, hardly accessible for complexation by any ligands. In fact, papers devoted to chalcogenide nanotubes functionalization are practically lacking. Tremel et al. [180] reported the first chemically specific and facile method for the functionalization of WS2 nanotubes and the subsequent coating of the functionalized WS2 nanotubes with monocrystalline TiO2 (anatase) nanoparticles by using a multifunctional polymeric ligand that had three different functional groups: (1) a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) linker used to coordinate to Ni2+ ions which, in turn, provided vacant coordination sites for binding to the surface S atoms of WS2 nanotubes, (2) an anchor group for attachment onto the surface of metal oxide nanoparticles (TiO2, ZrO2, Fe2O3, etc.) and (3) a fluorescent dye molecule for detection purposes. They carried out functionalization and coating of WS2 nanotubes with TiO2 nanoparticles by anchoring of the organic ligand to the sulphur surface by using the Ni2+ ion as a soft transition metal, whose octahedral coordination sphere was blocked completely on one side by the scorpionate-type ligand (NTA) while the other part of the coordination sphere remained vacant for binding to the surface S atoms of WS2 nanotubes. Then, immobilization of TiO2 nanoparticles was performed by using free catecholate groups (3-hydroxytyramine), as shown in Fig. 12\n. As the reaction in the absence of Ni2+ ions did not show binding of the polymeric ligand to the WS2 nanotubes, authors concluded that the Ni2+ ions were involved in the binding of the multifunctional polymer to the chalcogenide nanotube. Due to their exceptional mechanical properties, authors suggested that functionalization of WS2 nanotubes opens several new fields for this class of materials, fields that have been pursued actively during the past few years for the related carbon nanotubes and various oxide materials [180].",

The REF-NTs were prepared by the impregnation of \u03b1-NaYF4 nanocrystals doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ into the porous of an AAO membrane (Fig. 13\n). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrated that the nanotubes were composed of close-packed uniform nanocrystals. Similarly, the Fe3O4 REF-NTs were obtained by the self-assembly of a mixture of Fe3O4 and Yb/Er doped \u03b2-NaYF4 nanocrystals in the AAO pore channels. Strong up-conversion fluorescent emissions were realized for the nanotube arrays and multifunctional nanotubes with up-conversion excitation in the near-infrared (NIR) region. A strong magnetic response of the multifunctional nanotubes was observed, which facilitated their separation from solution by magnetic decantation using a permanent magnet. Although no analytical application has been performed with these multifunctional nanotubes, authors suggested that by combining the attractive tubular structure with up-conversion fluorescent and magnetic properties, the resulting multifunctional nanotubes are ideal candidates for biomedical applications such as bioseparation and targeted drug delivery.",

In fact, silica nanoparticles have gained much attention over the past two decades for their application in catalysis, separation, (bio)sensors, and adsorption. There are several properties that make silica nanoparticles attractive as analytical materials [182], [183]. Particle sizes can be tuned from 50 to 300 nm, with stable and rigid frame that allows for resistance to mechanical stress and degradation. Pore diameters can be tuned between 2 and 10 nm allowing for different chemicals/analytes loadings. Also, they have a high surface area (>700 m2/g) and large pore volume (>0.9 cm3/g) allowing high loadings of chemicals. Silica nanomaterials are \u201ctransparent\u201d. Also, silica sols in the size range of 10\u2013100 nm have been observed to possess a remarkable stability at very high salt concentrations (e.g., 0.15 M NaCl) at pH > 10.5 [184], [185] and even at their isoelectric point (pHiep) [186]. They are unlikely to absorb light in the near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions or to interfere with magnetic fields, which allows dopants/functional groups inside silica matrix to keep their original optical and magnetic properties. Consequently, the interior and exterior surfaces of silica nanoparticles can be selectively functionalized with different moieties on either surface [182], [183].",

They developed silica micro beads embedded with both semiconductor quantum dots (QD) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanocrystals as a new class of dual-function carriers for optical encoding and magnetic separation (Fig. 14\n). Silica beads derivatized with C18 alkyl chains were used as they offered a strongly hydrophobic environment for the incorporation of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide-coated QDs and oleic acid/oleylamine coated-iron oxide nanoparticles. The embedding (doping) process was carried out by either simultaneous or sequential addition of quantum dots and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanocrystals to a well-mixed solution silica beads dissolved in butanol. Due to the highly porous internal structure and very large surface area, the mesoporous beads (with pore sizes ranging from 2 to 100 nm) allowed up to 1 million nanoparticles to be incorporated into a single micrometer-sized bead. Iron oxide nanocrystals provided superparamagnetic properties for bead separation and target enrichment, although they attenuated the QD fluorescence intensity not by a typical quenching process but as result of the broad optical absorption spectrum of mixed-valence Fe3O4. In order to improve biocompatibility and reduced non-specific binding, the encoded beads were further coated with amphiphilic polymers such as octylaminepoly (acrylic acid). The results indicate that the polymer-coated beads were well-suited for target capturing and enrichment, yielding magnetic separation efficiencies higher than 99%. By using beads doped with QDs emitting in the green and red wavelengths, authors demonstrated that it was possible to prepare dual-function optical and magnetic beads encoded with three different and discernible spectroscopic signatures. These encoded beads are expected to find broad applications in high-throughput and multiplexed biomolecular assays.",

TNT bound to the amine group on the nanoparticle surface and absorbed energy from the nearby FITC via fluorescence energy transfer. This process resulted in quenching of the dye fluorescence signal. The detection limit reached 1 nM TNT in solution and several ppb of TNT vapor in air. By a similar method, Pb2+ and Ni2+ ions were determined [191], [192]. Recent progress in silica NP research, with special emphasis on applications in the fields of bio-labeling, imaging, separation, analysis, disease diagnostics and therapeutics, and other related technologies has been recently reviewed [182], [183].

These nanoparticles are amorphous in nature and need further heat treatment to get a crystalline product [204]. For the synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites, much attention has been paid to hydrothermal methods [205], [206], [207], in which the chemical reaction can proceed under auto-generated pressure upon heating. The process is efficient enough to achieve the crystalline phase at relatively low temperatures and the particles prepared through hydrothermal synthesis are expected to have large surface area, smaller crystallite size, and higher stability than those obtained by other methods such as the sol\u2013gel technology or the microemulsion processes. The hydrothermal method has also been used to prepare TiO2 nanotubes [208], [209]. The solvothermal method, a powerful route for preparing nanomaterials of oxides and metal chalcogenides, is similar to the hydrothermal method except that organic solvents are used instead of water [210], [211]. In this approach chemical reactions take place in an organic solvent under supercritical or sub-critical pressures under different temperature conditions. Solvothermal process provides an excellent chemical homogeneity and the possibility of synthesizing meta-stable structures with different morphologies at low-reaction temperatures [211], [212], [213].",

Some work, in combination with other nanoparticles has been recently published. Yuan et al. [214] have prepared on a gold electrode a multifunctional film based on highly hydrophilic, non-toxic and conductive TiO2 nanoparticles/gold nanoparticles bilayer. Subsequently, positively charged horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was assembled onto the bilayer films, which provided an interface to assemble gold nanoparticles for immobilization of carcinoembryonic antibody (anti-CEA). Finally, HRP was used to block sites against non-specific binding. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were applied to characterize the electrochemical properties of the self-assembly process. The CVs reduction current of the immunosensor decreased linearly in two concentrations ranges of CEA from 0.3 to 10 ng mL\u22121 and from 10 to 80 ng mL\u22121 with a detection limit of 0.2 ng mL\u22121 in presence of 0.7 mM H2O2 in analyte solution. The proposed immunosensor exhibited good accuracy, high sensitivity, long-term stability and made it to determine CEA in serum samples with satisfactory results. The multifunctional nanocomposite matrix showed good hydrophilicity and was effective for tunneling electrons between immobilized HRP and electrode surface and for retaining the bioactivity of immobilized molecules. According to the authors, the developed protocol has several attractive advantages including simple fabrication, long-time storage stability, high sensitivity, and it could be extended to the determination of other species of clinical or environmental concern.",

Oxygen responsiveness of Nb doped TiO2/CNT materials outperformed that of Nb doped titania, although it was lower than that of TiO2/CNT samples. Authors explained this fact considering that presence of CNTs could alter the optimal value for the concentration of Nb in TiO2. The gas sensitivity studies performed on the different samples have shown that the hybrid layers based on titania and carbon nanotubes possess an unprecedented responsiveness towards oxygen (i.e. more than four times higher than that shown by optimized Nb doped TiO2 films). According to the authors, these new hybrid sensors show a strong potential for monitoring traces of oxygen (i.e. \u226410 ppm) in a flow of CO2, which is interesting for the beverage industry.",

As an example, to overcome photo bleaching and spectral overlapping observed when dyes are used as labels in immunoassay microarrays, Kennedy et al. [223] developed a new type of fluorophore based on crystalline europium-doped gadolinium oxide (Eu:Gd2O3) nanoparticles. The synthesized Eu:Gd2O3 nanoparticles exhibited narrow red emission, large Stokes shift, photostable laser-induced fluorescence with a long lifetime (1 ms). In order to covalently conjugate antibodies, amino functionalization of the particles was achieved by poly (l-lysine) (PL) encapsulation. The multifunctional nanoparticles were then successfully applied as reporters in a competitive fluorescence micro immunoassay for phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA), a generic biomarker of human exposure to pyrethroid insecticides. Microarrays were fabricated by micro contact printing of BSA\u2013PBA in line patterns (10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm). The microarray immunoassay demonstrated a limit of detection of 1.4 \u03bcg L\u22121 PBA.

This protective layer allowed the dispersion of the particles in aqueous solution with the advantage that the luminescence intensity of polysiloxane coated Gd2O3 nanoparticles was greatly enhanced compared with the naked Gd2O3 core. Due to the presence of amino groups, organic dyes and bio targeting groups (nucleic acid, biotin, streptavidin) were covalently linked to the polysiloxane network.

Despite analytical research in the field is active there is still much space to explore and to explain, tremendous opportunities and significant challenges to be afforded. For example, whereas present work is more concentrated on multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles, very few studies on multifunctional gold nanoparticles or QDs are still appearing.
