Amongst these, ADP-ribosylation is of emerging interest because of its ability to modify different macromolecules in the cells, and its association with many key biological processes, such as DNA-damage repair, DNA replication, transcription, cell division, signal transduction, stress and infection responses, microbial pathogenicity and aging. In this review, we provide an update on novel pathways and mechanisms regulated by ADPribosylation in organisms coming from all kingdoms of life.",

            "text": "Evolution shows remarkable examples of how living species adapt and survive in response to natural and environmental changes [1] . All living organisms have evolved molecular mechanisms that enable them to quickly adapt to nutritional, chemical or physical alterations. These adaptations are induced by cascades of molecular events involving qualitative and quantitative changes in the basic, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Ultimately, these signalling events will trigger the appropriate response. One of the most common tools to induce a rapid change in the cellular environment is the post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins by addition of chemical moieties, such as phosphate, acyl (most commonly methyl and acetate), small proteins or sugars [2]. One highly conserved PTM system is the ADP-ribosylation, the addition of ADP-ribose (ADPr) groups from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) to proteins [3] (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, ADP-ribosylation can happen not only on proteins but also on other macromolecules such as DNA, or small chemical groups [4-7] (Fig. 1 ). The first discovered ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) enzymes were identified as bacterial toxins, such as the Cholera and Diphtheria toxins [7, 8] . These toxins are released from bacterial pathogens to irreversibly modify host proteins to gain an advantage over the infected host [7] [8] [9] . Later on, homologous transferases and modification-reversing hydrolytic enzymes have been discovered in organisms from all kingdoms of life [3] . Moreover, many recent observations show how viral genomes evolved the genetic tools that enable them to modulate ADP-ribosylation signalling of infected cells [10] [11] [12] [13] . ADP-ribosylation seems to be particularly prominent in the highest organisms and it is best studied for the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) superfamily of ART enzymes [3,7, [14] [15] [16] . Altogether, ADPribosylation is a widespread modification that controls a vast number of cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, transcription, cell-cycle progression, cell division, unfolded protein response, aging, nitrogen fixation, microbial pathogenicity, cell death and many others [7, 14, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, our understanding of ADP-ribosylation is still in its infancy, as can be seen from the current rapid rate of discoveries of previously unknown pathways regulated by ADP-ribosylation.",

Human PARP1, PARP2 and Tankyrases (PARP5a and PARP5b), and close homologues from lower organisms and bacteria are able to produce long repeating chains of ADPr on target proteins [3, 7, 16, 23, [35] [36] [37] . PARP1 and PARP2 can also catalyse the formation of branched chains of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) on proteins and possibly DNA [6, 35] . Most of the other characterized PARPs are mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferases (monoARTs) [16, 24, 35] . Another, highly diverged ART may also belong to PARP-like proteins, but it transfers a phosphate group from RNA onto ADPr (Fig. 1 ). This is KptA/Tpt1 protein, RNA phosphotransferase found in all three domains of life [7, 38] . In yeast, Tpt1 catalyses a NAD + -dependent dephosphorylation of tRNAsplicing intermediates, generating ADPr-1-phopshate through a cyclic intermediate [38] (Fig. 1) .",

Macrodomains are found in proteins from all kingdoms of life supporting different cellular processes [3, 16, [51] [52] [53] [54] . Macrodomain-containing proteins can recognize variety of substrates, including MARylated and PARylated proteins, different ADPr metabolites (such as OAADPr) [16, [53] [54] [55] and RNA [54, 56, 57] (Fig. 1) . Some macrodomains have also evolved enzymatic activity and are capable of hydrolysing ADP-ribosylation (see below) [36, 49, 54, 58, 59] . As a consequence, macrodomain-containing proteins are involved in a diverse set of cellular functions, such as chromatin remodelling and DNA-damage repair, oxidative stress response, metabolic processes and pathogenic mechanisms [3,5,10-13,30,37, 53, 54, [59] [60] [61] . In addition to macrodomain, several other widely distributed domains have been described as readers for ADP-ribosylation, such as the PAR-binding zinc finger (PBZ) [62] , the WWE (named after three of its conserved residues) [63] , the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain [64] and the PAR-binding motifs (PBM) which is abundant in DNA-damage repair proteins [65] .",

Two evolutionary unrelated protein domains are known to support this catalytic activity: already mentioned macrodomains and the DraG-like fold containing proteins [3, 67, 68] . The catalytic macrodomain fold is found in a number of proteins coming from all the kingdoms of life [54] . In humans four catalytic macrodomains have been identified: poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), MacroD1, MacroD2 and terminal ADP-ribosyl glycohydrolase 1 (TARG1/C6orf130) [16, 36, 54, 59, 69, 70] . PARG efficiently cleaves the PAR-specific O-glycosidic ribose-ribose bonds, however, it is unable to remove the terminal ADPr unit directly linked to a protein ( Fig. 1) [36, 58] . The existence of PARG-splicing variants ensure the presence of the enzyme both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm or in membranous organelles [71] [72] [73] and allows for rapid turnover of PAR, ensuring tight control of this modification [66] . The terminal ADPr moiety is removed by MARylation preferring hydrolases, such as MacroD1, MacroD2 or TARG1 [58, 59, 69, 70] (Fig. 1) . The latter enzymes can also hydrolyse some other ADPr metabolites, such as OAADPr [54, 55, 74] (Fig. 1 ). An additional macrodomain containing protein is Poa1p (YBR022) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, functionally characterized as a specific phosphatase that removes the phosphate group of ADPr-1-phosphate in the tRNA-splicing pathway in yeast [75] .",

Mammals carry distant homologues of DraG (called ARH1-3 in humans), whose functions are so far not fully understood. The ARH1 protein shows efficient hydrolytic activity against MARylated proteins on arginine residues [77] . ADP-ribosylated proteins on arginine are found on cellular plasma membrane, in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [42, 43, [78] [79] [80] [81] and in cytoplasm [82, 83] . ARH3 was shown to hydrolyse the O-glycosidic bond of PAR chains and OAADPr [79, [84] [85] [86] . ARH2 is believed to be catalytically inactive [79, 84, 85] .",

            "text": "ADP-ribosylation in mammals is known to regulate a number of different processes [14, 17, 24, [26] [27] [28] 30 ]. Best understood is regulation of DNA-damage repair pathways by PARP1-3 that are activated upon binding to DNA breaks [14, [26] [27] [28] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] PARP1 also plays roles in transcription and metabolism [29, 30, 103] . The functions of other PARPs are comparatively much less understood [27, 28] . PARP4 (also called VPARP) is a component of the cytosolic ribonucleoprotein vault complex, however, its biological functions are unknown [104] . PARPs 5a and 5b (tankyrases) are best understood for their roles in mitosis [19, 25] and Wnt signalling [105] [106] [107] [108] , but they also have roles at telomere and DNA-damage repair [108] [109] [110] . PARP6 and PARP8 are poorly understood, however, PARP6 has been shown to be involved in hippocampus neuronal development [111] . Several PARPs (PARP7 PARP10, PARP12 and PARP13) are involved in mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, mediated either by RNA-binding domains [112] or by ADP-ribosylation of RNA-binding proteins [20] . In addition, PARP10 has been implied in the regulation of NF-kB [113, 114] , GSK3b [113, 115] and transcription [103, 113, 116] . Also, PARP9 and PARP14 are suggested to act on transcription, in particular of genes required for macrophage activation [117] . PARP16 regulates the unfolded protein response [18] . Concurrent with its nuclear pore localization, PARP11 modifies targets involved in the coordination of the nuclear envelope and the organization of nuclear pores [118, 119] .",

In this respect, the progress has been additionally hampered in the case of poly(ADP-ribosyl) ating PARPs, as the current methods to identify sites do not make the difference between mono and poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation for specific amino acid position. Overall, acidic residues might be the main targets for most of the PARPs [35, [121] [122] [123] [124] but cysteine [35, 120, 123] , arginine [121, 123, 124] , lysine [83, 121, 123, 124] and serine residues [125] have been suggested as well. ADP-ribosylation of acidic residues and lysines has been shown to be induced by oxidative stress [83] . However, additional evidence has revealed that many of these lysine residues may have been misannotated as modification sites, and that actual modification sites are proximal serine residues, that usually follow immediately after these lysine residues [126] . Indeed, the KS motif has been identified as a preferred target for serine ADP-ribosylation by several studies [125] [126] [127] . Notably, serine ADP-ribosylation seems to be specific for regulation of DNA damage response and other pathways important for genome stability such as regulation of chromatin structure, transcription and mitosis [127] . HPF1/C4orf27 is the first protein identified acting as a specificity factor for the serine ADP-ribosylation [127, 128] . It acts in conjunction with PARP1 and PARP2 proteins and directs modification of histones, PARP1 itself, high-mobility group proteins and likely many other proteins [127] .",

A notable exception is the DraT/DraG system of nitrogen-fixating bacteria from the Azospirillum and Rhodospirillum genera. DraT homologues are restricted to several nitrogen-fixing bacteria, while DraG homologues are distributed across all three domains of life [67] . Endogenous ADP-ribosylation has also been reported for some other bacterial species where this process probably regulates important cellular functions such as sporulation in Bacillus subtilis [130] , development and cell-cell interaction in Myxococcus xanthus [131, 132] , as well as differentiation and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces [133] [134] [135] [136] .",

Streptomyces are soil-inhabiting Grampositive bacteria best known for their complex life cycle that includes morphological differentiation and the production of various secondary metabolites including antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs and immunosuppressors. ADP-ribosylation has been discovered in Streptomyces over 20 years ago [137] . First reports demonstrated considerable ADP-ribosylating activities in cell extracts and suggested a role for ADP-ribosylation in growth and differentiation processes in Streptomyces griseus [133, 134] . In both Str. griseus and Streptomyces coelicolor, ADP-ribosylation patterns change with morphological differentiation [138, 139] and several identified ADP-ribosylated proteins in Str. coelicolor suggested a connection between protein ADP-ribosylation and the regulation of metabolic requirements of the cells [135] .",

Two ARTs have been characterized in Streptomyces, SCO5461 from Str. coelicolor [136, 140] and Scabin from plant pathogen Streptomyces scabies [141] . These proteins are homologues of pierisins [4] and possess guanine-specific DNA ART activity, but they are not conserved across the Streptomyces species and cannot be found in Str. griseus, suggesting that the major protein ARTs in Streptomyces have yet to be discovered. Disruption of SCO5461 leads to conditional pleiotropic phenotype characterized by defects of morphological differentiation, antibiotic production and secretion [136] . The SCO3953 protein is a homologue of yeast tRNA 2 0 -phosphotransferase Tpt1, an essential enzyme in yeast that catalyses the final step in tRNA splicing. This reaction includes dephosphorylation of tRNA 2 0phosphate in two steps; transfer of ADPr from NAD + to tRNA 2 0 -phosphate that generates a 2 0 -phospho-ADPr-RNA intermediate and release of mature tRNA together with ADPr 1\u2033-2\u2033-cyclic phosphate [142] (Fig. 1) . Tpt1 homologues are found distributed across all domains of life including bacterial species that have no known intron-containing tRNAs (Str. coelicolor and E. coli whose orthologue is called KptA are among them). Therefore, bacterial Tpt1/KptA homologues should have some yet uncovered substrate(s) and function(s).",

The toxin component of the TA system is a DNA ART (DarT), which catalyses the modification of the second thymidine base in the TNTC motif of ssDNA. This modification is reversed by the DNA ADPr glycohydrolase (DarG) activity of the antitoxin. The substrate specificity of DarT led to the discovery that the ADP-ribosylation interferes with DNA replication and induces DNA damage signalling via the SOS response [5] . DarG belongs to the ALC1-like class of macrodomains and is structurally most similar to human TARG1. In addition to the reversal of the DNA ADP-ribosylation by DarG macrodomain hydrolytic activity, protein-protein interaction between DarT and DarG (resembling a type II TA system) revealed a second layer of DarT regulation [5]. All available data including the fact that DarG is essential in M. tuberculosis suggest that targeting this ADPribosylating TA system may have a therapeutic potential [5, 155] .",

SirTM is encoded within an operon containing a modification carrier protein (GcvH-L). GcvH-L becomes doubly modified by two different PTMs through the actions of SirTM (ADP-ribosylation) and another component of the operon that acts as a lipoate ligase (synthesising the protein lipoylation) [2, 49, 156 ]. Yet another protein product of the same operon is a macrodomain protein (belonging to the MacroD-type class), which specifically reverses the ADP-ribosylation of GcvH-L [49] . It was suggested that the lipoylation acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (either host derived or environmentally induced), while the reversible ADP-ribosylation may regulate interactions with other proteins involved in the oxidative stress response that are part of this protein complex [49] . SirTM homologues are found in a number of fungal pathogens [49] .",

The pathogenic bacterium L. pneumophila uses ubiquitin effector proteins of the Sde family, a new class of ubiquitin-specific monoART, to modulate the host ubiquitin signalling and create a favourable growth environment within the host cell [158] . One of the Sde proteins, SdeA, contains a monoART domain as well as phosphodiesterase domain (PDE) [95, 96] . The monoART catalyses the ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin on Arg42, while the PDE hydrolizes the ADPrphosphodiester bond, thus establishing a 5 0 -phosphoribosyl modification (Fig. 1) . Subsequently, the phosphoribosylated ubiquitin is linked to a serine residue within target proteins, thus completing an E2/3 ligaseindependent ubiquitination system. Sde-mediated ubiquitination of several ER-associated Rab proteins and reticulon 4 impairs several cellular processes, such as mitophagy, TNF signalling, tubular endoplasmic reticulum functions and proteasomal degradation, allowing better bacterial growth [95, 96] .",

It has been shown that this macrodomain promotes virulence and suppresses the innate immune response during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection [11] . In addition to the MacroD-type of macrodomains, a highly diverged macrodomain SUD-M was found as a part of the nsP3 in SARS coronaviruses. This unique macrodomain binds nucleic acids, preferentially RNA, and is crucial for viral genome replication/transcription [164] . Numerous other examples show that viral macrodomains affect virus replication and interferon-response in humans [12, 13] . Viral macrodomains may act against mammalian PARPs that are known to possess antiviral activity [10] . PARPs involved in the antiviral defence are interferon-inducible, bear the signature of accelerated evolution and inhibit virus replication [165] . Specifically, PARP7, PARP10 and PARP12 have been experimentally shown to act as inhibitors of virus replication [166] . Another rapidly evolving PARP with broad antiviral activity is PARP13 (zinc finger antiviral protein), which specifically binds to viral RNA sequences targeting them for degradation [167] . Evidences for positive selection have also been found in macro-PARPs (PARP9, PARP14 and PARP15) and PARP4 [168] . In some cases, cellular PARP activity can be beneficial for viral infection rather than inhibitory [169, 170] .",

Yet, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing ADP-ribosylation signalling and the physiological and pathophysiological importance of the pathways regulated by ADP-ribosylation are still poorly understood. Thus, there are many exciting findings waiting to be discovered in this field of research and the scientific community researching the ADP-ribosylation has been steadily growing in recent years. Many researchers are now also investing great efforts in developing new platforms, tools, methods and pipelines to study the ADP-ribosylation [83, 91, 122, 123, 125, 161, [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] these should greatly facilitate further understanding of the complexity of molecular and cellular mechanisms controlled by ADP-ribosylation. 28 ",
