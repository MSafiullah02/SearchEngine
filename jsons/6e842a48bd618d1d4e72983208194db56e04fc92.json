Furthermore, COVID-19 and SARS share the same origin -Chinaand everything related to China seems controversial in Taiwan (even more so after the current administration took power in 2016) because of the complex historical, social, economic and political relationship between the two countries. China earned a track record for concealing information during the SARS outbreak, 16 and it is widely believed in Taiwan that China has done the same regarding COVID-19. Economically, Taiwanese enterprises invest intensively in Wuhan and other provinces in China, which results in frequent travel between the two countries. Socially, a number of Taiwanese marry Chinese citizens, and the Lunar New Year is a time for family reunions, which may have contributed to virus transmission from China to Taiwan. Finally, and most importantly, the current administration in Taiwan is suspicious of China, which leads it to take a sober look at the information and news released by China and to take a precautionary approach in countering COVID-19.",

The critical issue here is how a constitutional democracy survives a public health emergency with the unprecedented magnitude of COVID-19. To be sure, governments worldwide have adopted a wide range of regulatory measures, 17 such as social distancing and stay-home orders, 18 mass testing, 19 contact-tracing and surveillance, 20 the shuttering of non-essential services 21 13 Taiwan's huge foreign reserve is also reflective of this \"self-help\" approach. and even border closures and national shutdowns. 22 The legality and legitimacy of such regulatory actions may be examined pursuant to different norms and standards underlying a country's respective political system, legal tradition and social context. On the one hand, an emergency calls for stronger and swifter governmental actions to safeguard public health and national security in a manner that may not allow sufficient time for parliamentary deliberation or traditional administrative procedures. 23 The urgency to take effective and efficient measures oftentimes justifies a wide margin of executive discretion. On the other hand, measures adopted in times of emergency tend to linger and become normalised. Emergencies frequently serve to expand the power of executive agencies and side-line legislative or even judicial gatekeepers or lead to irreversible harm to fundamental human rights. 24 In Taiwan, among those measures adopted to combat COVID-19, the Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens (COVID-19 Special Act) seems to have triggered controversial questions about the bending and even breaking of fundamental human rights and core legal principles. This paper therefore aims to offer an anatomy of Taiwan's regulatory actions taken in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, assess their implications for risk regulation and governance in a global context and urge a reimagining of the administrative state in thehopefullypost-COVID-19 world.",

First, because of China's concealment of information in the early stages of the outbreak and the WHO's failure to take appropriate action, there was very little scientific evidence or international guidance for risk assessment. Second, due to the tensions between Taiwan and China and the former's exclusion from the WHO, the management of risks in public health emergencies is not merely a technical and scientific issue, but also a socioeconomic and even a political task. The government is forced to make decisions in the absence of solid data and to take additional steps ahead of emergencies by using its own judgement. Thus, public health risk assessment goes beyond disease control and extends to holistic social, economic and 32 See Y Lee and B Blanchard, \"Taiwan Says WHO Ignored Its Coronavirus Questions at Start of Outbreak\" (US News, 24 March 2020) <https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-03-24/taiwan-says-who-ignoredits-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak> (last accessed 24 March 2020); \"Taiwan Says WHO Failed to Act on Coronavirus Transmission Warning\" (Financial Times, 20 March 2020) <https://www.usnews.com/news/world/ articles/2020-03-24/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak> (last accessed 26 March 2020 political management. 39 This reflects a classic paradox in risk regulation 40 : if a country adopts a precautionary approach and engages in advanced preparedness, such a decision is thus to be made in the absence of sufficient data and scientific certainty and to run counter to the principle of scientific-based decision-making. Transparency and reasoning requirements are likely to be side-lined in the decision-making process. In times of emergency, such a paradox is exacerbated by the urgency and uncertainty of an event and may only be partly addressed by ex post review and accountability mechanisms, which are also prone to hindsight bias.",

Taiwan has fought a long battle with fake news (China is the primary origin) since 2012 and has modernised its legislative and regulatory responses. 43 Citing the CDC Act and the Social Order Maintenance Act (SOM Act), the government has 39 See Yip, supra, note 13. 40 . 43 In order to take charge of disinformation dissemination during epidemics, not only the CDC Act Arts 9 and 63 but also the Social Order Maintenance Act (SOM Act) Article 63(I)(5) can be cited as a legal basis to penalise those who spread fake news with imprisonment or a fine or the mass media companies who refuse to help correct disinformation upon notification by the authority. fined or even arrested individuals for spreading rumours regarding COVID-19 and the shortage of household necessities. 44 These measures may seem well-intentioned and make some sense in theory, but they may lack the scope of sensitivity regarding what is at stake. Some criticise the fairly broad authority and substantial discretion extended by law to competent authorities in determining when and what information should be contained and punished. 45 If the government fails to strike a proper yet difficult balance, 46 the fight against fake news and misinformation may ultimately backfire, resulting in a chilling effect that causes further information withholding, self-censorship and poor communication. Noting this dilemma, the government is gradually shifting to an open communication method that aims to actively inform the public via social media and rectify the marketplace of speech with correct information in a timely manner.",

Taiwan first banned the export of medical masks on 24 January 2020, and further implemented a nationwide requisition and real-name rationing scheme premised upon the National Health 44 B Hioe and L Wooster, \"Taiwan News Publishes COVID-19 Misinformation as Epidemic Spreads\" (New Bloom, 12 February 2020) <https://newbloommag.net/2020/02/12/coronavirus-taiwan-news> (last accessed 23 March 2020). 45 See, eg, M-H Huang, \"Fake News, Social Media, and the Freedom of Speech in the Internet Era (in Chinese)\" (2019) 292 Taiwan Law Review 5; Taiwan Association for Human Rights, \"Guanjhih Bushih Syunsi, Ying Jiangu Yanlunzihyou (\u7ba1\u5236\u4e0d\u5be6\u8a0a\u606f\uff0c\u61c9\u517c\u9867\u8a00\u8ad6\u81ea\u7531) [Fake News Regulations Should Consider the Protection of the Freedom of Expression]\" (TAHR, 13 January 2020) <https://newbloommag.net/2020/02/12/coronavirus-taiwan-news> (last accessed 24 March 2020). 46 But these regulations require a delicate balance because excessive controls of freedom of expression and freedom of the press would also present a threat to democracy, as much as would fake news. 47 Taiwan's risk regulation against the global COVID-19 crisis has so far been one of the successful stories of the crisis; ibid. In addition, among others, Korea is also taking a proactive approach to combating COVID-19. See Insurance (NHI) system after only a few days. 48 From an economic perspective, the government has taken necessary measures to prioritise the acquisition and allocation of key medical supplies. To ensure a steady domestic supply, the government even drew up a budget of US$6.66 million to invest in equipment and 60 production lines by way of public-private partnerships. 49 Taiwan's supplies of medical masks have since risen at a steady pace, growing from daily manufacturing capability at 2.44 million units on 22 January to 13 million units in early March 2020. 50 Such a surge in domestic medical mask production has made possible special allocations to medical personnel, airport control and schools. Taiwan further agreed to provide 100,000 masks per week to the USA in exchange for protective medical clothing when its production capacity is stabilised. 51 In the process of optimising the supply of medical masks, however, a more ethicssensitive framework to address distributional justice issues (eg unequal access to medical mask outlets in practice due to urban-rural differences) was overlooked. This can also be seen in the government's management of medical resources in disaster preparedness planning. In Taiwan, the Communicable Disease Control Medical Network (CDCMN) was established following the SARS outbreak to centralise and optimise medical resources, 52 under which designated infection hospitals would be appointed as centres for the provision of treatment and resource mobilisation during public health emergencies. The CDCMN also facilitated the expansion of negative-pressure isolation rooms (1100 beds) 53 and isolation rooms (21,000 beds). 54 Yet this system and its methodology for prioritisation are predominantly based on biomedical models and medical resources rationing. Accordingly, they may overlook complex socioeconomic dynamics and varying local needs. 55 A framework for healthcare rationing and clinical prioritisation, especially under such exceptional circumstances, is desirable. Understandably, it may not be possible to set up ex ante criteria due to the uncertainty of an emergency. As such, extending broad discretion to physicians seems justifiable. 56 Yet, even so, legal and ethical guidance that strikes a balance between efficiency and fairness, 57 and transparency and due process in different circumstances, is much needed, as it can help guide the process of rationing medical resources 58 and facilitate ex post review and accountability mechanisms. 59 b. Border control and travel bans Because cross-border travel constitutes the primary source of COVID-19 transmission for Taiwan, it proactively imposed entry restrictions for people from China as early as January 2020. 60 Such restrictions were subsequently widened, and travellers from other countries listed on the Travel Notice were required to be quarantined for 14 days, eventually followed by a ban of all inbound foreign visitors on 9 March 2020. 61 In addition to prohibiting inbound travel, outbound travel is also restricted: medical personnel, civil servants and middle-and primary-school teachers, students and staff are prohibited or strongly discouraged from travelling abroad, with a view towards maintaining human medical resources and avoiding transmission among vulnerable groups. 62 These border control measures and travel 55 There has been no research done regarding whether this centralised system and prioritisation methodology would unfairly affect other healthcare priorities (such as those for non-communicable diseases). B Jennings and J Arras, \"Ethical Guidance for Public Emergency Preparedness and Response: Highlighting Ethics and Values in Vital Public Health Service\" (2008) <https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/phethics/docs/white_paper_final_for_ website_2012_4_6_12_final_for_web_508_compliant.pdf> (last accessed 26 March 2020). 56 Due to the significant uncertainty of a novel virus, it is important to confer more discretion to physicians so that they can adopt timely and effective measures. SA Raza, \"What 'Distributive Justice' Means for Doctors Treating COVID-19\" (3 Quarks Daily, 22 March 2020) <https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2020/03/what-distributive-justicemeans-for-doctors-treating-covid-19.html> (last accessed 26 March 2020). 57 For example, the segments of the population upon whom the burden is likely to fall and the impacts of this should be evaluated, and cost-effectiveness analysis should not be the only evaluation tool. S Hoffman, \"Preparing bans are supported by the general public in the name of public interest at the expense of individual liberty. 63 In times of health emergencies, public interest may serve as a justification for the government to bypass the legal imperatives and bring about a downwards cycle. 64 An illustrative example is the CECC's decision to publish the names of quarantined individuals who travel \"unnecessarily\" to these countries and to deprive their eligibility for the quarantine subsidy. 65 Whereas the CDC Act, in Article 58(I)(4), authorises the government to impose home-based quarantine on individuals entering Taiwan from the worst-affected countries, the publication of the names of the quarantined individuals is without legal basis and disproportionately invades individuals' privacy. The travel bans also suffer from the same weaknesses. Article 5(I) of the Immigration Act authorises the government to restrict the freedom to travel abroad for individuals involved in national security, yet neither medical professionals nor teachers/students are subject to the Act. 66 c. Big data and surveillance To have a clear picture of the travel and contact history, health records, real-time movement and other relevant information of (potentially) infected persons, the government has resorted to \"big data\" technologies to facilitate the effective implementation of quarantine measures and efficient contact tracing and locating. For instance, the government has actively integrated individuals' travel records from the National Immigration Agency with other existing databases, such as the NHI and even police systems. Physicians then have a channel by which to access a patient's travel history through the NHI card reader. The government also used the NHI database, which contains the entire population's medical records, to review all patients' health status and to locate suspected patients. Several patients' daily routes, explored through surveillance cameras and mobile phone tracking, were disclosed to the public so that people who have visited these places can be on alert. 67 A monitoring system, which can track individuals through GPS using their mobile devices and receive their daily health reports, was built to ensure individuals' compliance with the quarantine order. 68 Despite their effectiveness, these measures, with their great potential to infringe upon individuals' privacy, were not carefully scrutinised according to rule of law and constitutional principles. Indeed, aggregating databases and mobility data can help fight COVID-19 by mapping travel and contact history, measuring social distancing and ensuring compliance with quarantine orders, but only when \"appropriate legal, organizational, and computational safeguards [are] in place\". 69 The Personal Data Protection Act sets out rules for collecting, processing and using personal data, such as lawfulness, purpose limitation, data minimisation and data security, 70 but it has long been plagued by inflexible legal transplant and legal formalism without taking into account local contexts, and it has failed to provide a healthy regulatory environment. Furthermore, while the CDC Act 71 and the COVID-19 Special Act 72 authorise the government to impose quarantine, isolation care and \"other necessary measures\", it remains debatable whether linking multiple national databases, disclosing names, collecting mobile data and analysing surveillance data qualify as \"necessary measures\" and pass the scrutiny of fundamental rule of law principles. Additionally, there is no notification process, revision mechanism or appeal process for those affected to challenge and seek dispute resolution. 73 Again, these formal requirements merely serve as minimum safeguards and by no means suffice. A stronger mechanism that ensures deliberation, transparency and accountability by dynamic agency interaction and oversight is urgently needed.",

It seems unnecessary and disproportionate to maintain years of travel history in the NHI ID card since COVID-19 has only a two-week incubation period. Furthermore, the lack of transparency when processing personal data also unfairly affects the substance and detail of the legal challenges individuals could have made to these privacy invasive measures. Thus, detailed information regarding how personal data are collected, the retention period for the data, the tools used to process the data and how the data analysis guides public health decisions should be published and made available to the public. Moreover, these measures failed to provide individuals fair opportunity to challenge in a timely manner the limits imposed on them based upon the analysis of personal data. Last but not least, there is no withdrawal mechanism either, which would set out the conditions for when the government should roll back the invasive programmes created in the name of public health. This mechanism is important because the data surveillance measures might long outlive the COVID-19 crisis.",

            "text": "Albeit marginalised, lawyers' input into the debates and discourses in countering COVID-19 would seem ever more urgent. Haunted by the ghost of martial law, Taiwan strives to maintain a high degree of democratic governance and rule of law. This in part explains why the government has been reluctant to issue an across-theboard lockdown that bears an authoritarian legacy. The same also applies to the Legislature's expeditious enactment of the COVID-19 Special Act as a legal basis for countering and containing the epidemic, with a view to fulfilling minimum democratic legitimacy and rule of law. Similarly, whereas the opposition party proposed that the President should invoke Article 43 of the Constitution to issue emergency decrees, 81 the President has so far declined to do so on the practical ground of the sufficiency of the COVID-19 Special Act, and perhaps also on the ideological ground of past bitter experiences. Nonetheless, constitutional and legal guarantees of human rights and the rule of law extend far beyond a formal legal basis for emergency-response measures. In recognition of broad and unlimited delegation, as endorsed in Article 7 of the COVID-19 Special Act, some members of the Legislative Yuan (Legislature of Taiwan) have proposed an amendment with more stringent rules designed to strengthen democratic oversight, remedy rule of law deficits and prevent systematic failure. 82 Relatedly, Taiwan's dynamic and robust civil society serves as an additional safety net for extreme measures in the name of emergencies. 83 In particular, the TAHR issued a statement emphasising the importance of democratic governance and the rule of law in times of pandemic, calling for resistance to blank-cheque authorisation. 84 Yet sticking to such a formalist understanding of legal safeguards remains inadequate. A broader socio-political mechanism that involves different stakeholders to ensure constructive deliberation and to address challenges seems desirable. 80 Taiwan's experience should also be read together with the dynamics of global health governance. Despite its alleged failure, the WHO continues to play a key role in providing guidance, expertise, technical assistance, a collaborative forum and personnel and practical tools, especially when the entire globe has been affected by COVID-19. 85 From Taiwan's perspective, meaningful participation in the WHO has been of the highest priority in its foreign relations, both for political reasons and for public health concerns. However, there is growing resentment of this organisation due to the sense of exclusion and the belief that is shared by at least some Taiwanese that this organisation uncritically takes positions that are overly favourable to China. Taiwan's scepticism towards the WHO and its relationship with China has driven the country's precautionary approach to coping with COVID-19. For the moment at least, the WHO seems to have lost its legitimacy and authority in global health governance and, subsequently, its charm for the Taiwanese people. Taiwan's experience may further fuel the existing momentum in favour of a global call for WHO reforms.",

The growing influence of China in international organisations is due in part to the US's turn from multilateralism to bilateralism, particularly under the Trump Administration. 86 Because Taiwan is at the forefront in containing the transmission of COVID-19, as well as China's expansionist ambition, a close bilateral US-Taiwan collaboration is natural. On 18 March 2020, the USA and Taiwan issued a joint statement to strengthen their consultation and cooperation in combatting COVID-19. 87 This joint statement is of practical and political importance. Practically, it reflects the two sides' wish to pursue closer collaboration; politically, after the USA switched its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China, it marks the first time that the Taiwanese Minister of Foreign Affairs signed an agreement or issued a statement with a US authority, albeit still through the American Institute in Taiwan. 88 In addition, the compelling need for cooperation in addressing the global COVID-19 crisis and for sharing experiences and information have similarly been felt by other countries. 89 Leaders in Western countries have voiced their support for Taiwan's participation in the WHO, 90 signalling yet another wave of contestation against international public authority.
