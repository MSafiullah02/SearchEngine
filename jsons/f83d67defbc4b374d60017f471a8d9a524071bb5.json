Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. Conclusions: Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.

            "text": "Attention is starting to be paid to the emergence of neuropsychiatric presentations of the disorder, including acute encephalopathy. It is estimated that more than one-third of patients with COVID-19 develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, including headache, paresthesia, and disturbed consciousness, and neuropsychiatric symptoms seem to be associated with more severe disease (Mao et al., 2020) . In a recent case series of 58 patients, 49 (84%) developed neuropsychiatric symptoms, including 40 (69%) with agitation, 26 (65%) with positive findings on the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale, and 14 (36%) with dysexecutive syndrome (Helms et al., 2020) . It is also known that up to 88% of patients develop anosmia or ageusia, thought to be secondary to invasion of the olfactory bulb by the virus, suggesting brain involvement (Lechien et al., 2020) . Coagulopathies leading to acute cerebrovascular disease are a known complication of ARDS-related disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Guillain-Barre syndrome has been described as a complication (Sedaghat & Karimi, 2020) , and a case report has also highlighted an acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (AHNE) resulting from infection with COVID-19, thought to be possibly related to cytokine storm (Poyiadji et al., 2020) . In addition to these specific pathologies, a case series from Wuhan demonstrated that at least 20% of patients who eventually died from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f had evidence of encephalopathy . While the preceding accompaniments of the virus may be interpreted as indirect CNS effects, a report from China describes the first case of viral encephalitis with COVID-19, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (Moriguchi et al., 2020) .",

While it is perhaps not surprising that delirium is common in patients with COVID-19, given the severity of illness and the fact that those suffering from complications of the illness are frequently older and have underlying vulnerabilities, some specific features of the delirium and hypotheses about the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to penetrate the CNS raise the question of whether a secondary delirium might not fully explain the phenomenon.",

All patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing conducted via nasopharyngeal swabs on the cobas 6800 system, which detects two SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. We discuss overlapping and unique features among these cases. We also hypothesize potential explanations for the observed features of COVID-19 delirium. To our knowledge, this is the first case series in the United States to characterize delirium in COVID-19. Mr. A is a 76-year-old former male boxer, living in an assisted living facility (ALF) with a history of major neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance and psychotic features and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission for 30 years. He had one prior psychiatric hospitalization one month prior to this presentation, for agitation and psychosis. Medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 1997, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension. He was admitted to the medical floor after presenting with paranoia and new aggression toward staff at his ALF. Noncontrast head computed tomography (NCHCT) was unremarkable beyond age-related small vessel disease and mild generalized volume loss. At presentation, he was febrile to 100.8\uf0b0F, with borderline leukopenia (white blood cell count [WBC] of 4.0k) and a chest x-ray (CXR) showing bibasilar opacities. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated on admission to 50.7 mg/L (reference range < 8 mg/L). Respiratory status was stable. SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, prompted by CXR, was positive. Per hospital protocol he was treated with atorvastatin, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine for 5 days. His only home psychiatric medication was olanzapine 2.5 mg at night, which was initially continued on admission. Psychiatry consultation was obtained on hospital day (HD) #1. On examination by the psychiatry consultant, prior to obtaining any new antipsychotic medication and despite normal tone at baseline prior to admission, he was noted to have multifocal myoclonus in his bilateral upper and lower extremities, cogwheeling in bilateral upper extremities, increased tone in bilateral lower extremities without ankle clonus, and a positive grasp and palmomental reflex. Lumbar puncture (LP), electroencephalogram (EEG) and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were not obtained. He displayed restlessness and purposeless striking out, requiring soft restraints for much of his hospitalization. His respiratory and hemodynamic status remained stable. Over the first three days of hospitalization, he had minimal speech production progressing to near mutism, despite normal verbal output at baseline.",

Medical history includes hypertension and osteoarthritis. At baseline, he was driving and living independently, with help from a visiting nurse, but with some known cognitive impairment. He was admitted after developing acute changes in mental status, including decreased speech output, word finding difficulties, and refusing to allow his visiting nurse into his house for the first time. On arrival he presented with right greater than left cogwheel rigidity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (unclear how this compared to his baseline) and new myoclonus (left greater than right), observed by a neurology consultant. NCHCT at admission was notable for scattered hypoattenuating areas in the periventricular and subcortical white matter alongside generalized mild volume loss (both unchanged from prior imaging one year ago). Given some staring spells and speech arrest, a video EEG with long-term monitoring showed diffuse theta slowing, frequent and low amplitude isolated generalized discharges, and frequent brief periods of 1 Hz generalized rhythmic delta activity with sharp contouring and bifrontal predominance. On HD #2 he was noted to have a slight cough prompting SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, which returned positive. He never manifested further respiratory symptoms or hemodynamic instability beyond a brief fever to 101.4 \uf0b0F on HD #4. He had a persistently elevated CRP, with a maximum of 29.1 mg/L on HD #11. Psychiatry consultation was obtained on HD #11 given ongoing agitation and need for restraints despite medical stability. Exam at that time was notable for continued spontaneous myoclonus in his bilateral upper and lower extremities. He had minimal speech production beyond incoherent mumbling (which progressed to mutism over a few days), and he was restless to the point of having skin breakdown in multiple areas. LP and MRI of the brain were not obtained. He was started on as needed trazodone 25 mg with IM chlorpromazine 25 mg as a rescue for severe agitation (administered once on HD #11 and subsequently discontinued after resulting in diffuse rash surrounding injection site on his right lower extremity that resolved within three days). On HD #12 he was started on standing valproic acid 250 mg IV twice daily (BID) for agitation, and his home carbidopa-levodopa was held given inability to tolerate oral medications. These changes produced limited change in behavior. A lorazepam trial was pursued on HD #13 (1 mg IV) to treat possible catatonia given observed mutism and staring. This produced profound sedation without marked improvement (Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (BFCRS) reduced from 12 to 9 within ten minutes of administration, with improvement noted in excitement and staring but no change to rigidity, mutism, or withdrawal). On HD #15 the dose of valproic acid was increased to 750 mg total daily dose after a trough level returned at 52.7 micrograms/ml. As of HD #18 he remained intermittently agitated and in a netbed but was noted to have improved speech production and had begun to swallow pills again. Carbidopa-levodopa was restarted.",

This raises the question of whether the symptoms may be more consistent with akinetic mutism, a phenomenon thought to be related to catatonia and typically associated with underlying brain injury involving midbrain-forebrain/medial frontal (mesolimbic) or midbrain-dorsolateral frontal (mesocortical) pathways. It is possible that the expression of classic catatonia involves the same mesencephalofrontal system postulated for akinetic mutism (Fisher, 1989) . Vulnerability to akinetic mutism may have been conveyed by the cessation of carbidopa-levodopa in Case 2 and by the exceptional pro-inflammatory state triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in all cases, which creates J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f enormous immunometabolic demands that may impair the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic pathways required for motivation and movement (Treadway, Cooper, & Miller, 2019) .",

This is perhaps analogous to the situation with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, which causes specific abnormalities in MRI and CSF analysis with positive CSF PCR testing that confirms the diagnosis. It is known that some coronaviruses, like J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV, appear capable of invading the brain via a synapse-connected chain extending from receptors in the lung to the medullary cardiorespiratory center (Li, Bai, & Hashikawa, 2020) .

Interestingly, however, in a sample of 7 patients with COVID-19 who manifested neuropsychiatric symptoms and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF, none of them tested positive, indicating that neuropsychiatric symptoms do not require viral CNS invasion (Helms et al., 2020) .",

Given the anatomical positioning, one could imagine the virus tracking along the olfactory bulb towards the uncinate fasciculus and reaching the anterior cingulate and basal forebrain directly via that pathway (Tromp et al., 2012) . Of interest is the fact that several major neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease feature anosmia as a prominent early symptom as well. Perhaps even more pertinent with regard to possible neuro-COVID inflammatory effects is the finding that in both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis patients, olfactory dysfunction is associated with age, neurocognitive dysfunction, inflammation and hippocampi and amygdalae volumes (Bombini et al., 2018) .

As described in other cases, ARDS could also lead to DIC, resulting in a cerebrovascular accident (Yadav & Kor, 2015) . Only the patient in Case 4 experienced symptoms that could be consistent with ARDS, however, and her delirium preceded worsening respiratory status. The pattern of older patients with pre-existing cognitive deficits being more susceptible would be consistent with higher vulnerability to metabolic encephalopathy seen in those with compromised substrates. The multifocal myoclonus is also common in delirium. Less common in toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, though, are the rigidity, progressive alogia, and abulia.

Though our cases were not consistent with AHNE based on available imaging, it is worth noting that the NCHCT findings in the report of AHNE were non-specific, and MRI was not obtained in any of our cases. Additionally, outside of AHNE, there are other syndromes that cause encephalopathy via the penetration of inflammatory cytokines into the subcortical regions. Perhaps the most well-known of these phenomena is the cytokine release syndrome, which can occur as a complication of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, and is well-known to lead to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f neuropsychiatric effects including delirium, language disturbances and seizures (Gust et al., 2018; Hay, 2018) . The high level of inflammatory markers seen in our cases suggests a significant systemic inflammatory response, which could lead to a cytokine storm, with BBB breakdown.",

This combination would suggest similarity to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and, indeed, the parallels between some of the features described here and early experiences with HIV encephalopathy are striking. Olfactory dysfunction is among the primary deficits of HIV infection and occurs independently of disease stage. Studies confirm early work suggesting that odor thresholds are elevated early in HIV infection and the decline in olfactory identification and discrimination abilities is correlated with reduced cognitive abilities (Mueller, Temmel, Quint, Rieger, & Hummel, 2002; Zucco & Ingegneri, 2004) . Symptoms such as myoclonus, progressive speech latency and alogia progressing to mutism, abulia and exquisite sensitivity to neuroleptics were common in the early days of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic and often signaled to providers invariable short-term demise (Rowland, 2000; Takeuchi et al., 2005) . The course often involved early symptoms of depression, apathy, decreased libido, and delirium marked by inattention and memory loss (Rowland, 2000) . These symptoms were followed by speech latency and alogia with hypomimia, bradyphrenia, bradykinesia, abulia, tremor and frontal release signs, signaling the Miller Fisher mesencephalofrontal disconnection syndrome (Fisher, 1989; Takeuchi et al., 2005) . Death quickly followed. If SARS-CoV-2 virus possesses neurotropic characteristics J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f similar to HIV, and frontal-striatal areas of vulnerability are shared, the neuropsychiatric symptoms described in the cases above may be better understood.",

HIV is known to invade the circumventricular region via two mechanisms: direct and indirect invasion. The virus is able to directly enter the brain hitching a ride in infected macrophages that cross the BBB to replace the perivascular immune cells. Infected macrophages migrate into brain tissues and recruit microglia, which trigger a strong neuroinflammatory response syndrome that includes activated astrocytes. This process induces neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. The circumventricular fenestrated endothelial areas represent the major thoroughfares for diapedesis of HIV-infected macrophages into the brain, and the regions abutting these areas determine the neuropsychiatric symptoms (Flier, Underhill, Lipton, & Gendelman, 1995) . Invasion of the area postrema makes the patient vulnerable to depression and delirium due to selective vulnerability of midbrain neurotransmitter cell bodies, involvement of the pineal gland disrupts the sleep-wake cycle, and the organum vasculosum directly abuts the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, making the patient vulnerable to abulia/akinetic mutism (Flier, Underhill, Saper, & Breder, 1994) .",

The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors that have been detected in both neurons and glial cells (Ferrari, Raizada, & Fior-Chadi, 2007) , which makes them vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 invasion (Baig, Khaleeq, Ali, & Syeda, 2020) . ACE2 receptors are also expressed by endothelial cells, and endotheliitis has also been implicated in the pathology of the virus as a result of both direct and indirect mechanisms (Varga et al., 2020) . In HIV, macrophage-endothelial cell interactive pathogenesis contributed to breakdown of the BBB and predisposed patients to HIV encephalopathy (Nottet, 1999) . If the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the brain directly via disrupted circumventricular fenestrated endothelium or up an olfactory nerve track, we might expect a similar pathophysiological pathway to what we see in HIV encephalopathy. The fact that HIV can lead to a chronic, in addition to an acute encephalopathy, makes studying the role of the BBB in blocking direct viral entry to the brain an even larger priority in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",
