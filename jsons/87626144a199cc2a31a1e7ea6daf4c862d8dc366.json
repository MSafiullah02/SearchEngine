It can be supplemented by utilization of efficient and validated drug discovery approaches such as drug repurposing/repositioning. The well reported and clinically used anti-malarial aminoquinoline drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) have shown potential to be repurposed to control the present pandemic by inhibition of COVID-19. The review elaborates the mechanism of action, safety (side effects, adverse effects, toxicity) and worldwide clinical trials for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to benefit the clinicians, medicinal chemist, pharmacologist actively involved in the management of COVID-19 infection.",

There is continuous requirement to explore the molecular mechanism towards underlying antiviral action and clinical benefits of aminoquinolines and the toxicity profile. The detailed outcomes will help to design the randomized clinical trials [95, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] .

As on 14 April 2020, approximately 961 clinical trials which are carrying on worldwide have been reported to WHO. The essential ethical requirement is use of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients with ethical trial approval or off-label. Timely availability of the clinical outputs to the biomedical fraternity is important considering the evolving outbreak and growing number of COIVD-19 infected patients with availability of any specific licensed drug. The use of chloroquine in the treatment of COIVD-19 infection is considered by WHO as experimental. In this regard use of chloroquine is associated with various concerns such as patient safety, close monitoring of drug use, etc. The repurposing of the anti-malarial drugs need to follow ethical approaches and may raise concern about shortage of such drugs. The outcomes of some of the reported in vivo, in vitro and clinical studies carried globally have been documented here one by one. Approximately 100 clinical trials are in recruiting or pending approval and are ongoing at single or multiples centers with satisfactory primary outcomes but final outcomes/results are pending.

The antiviral effects are reproducible with standard dose with favorable tissue and lung penetration. The proposed mechanism of viral inhibition involves increased pH in endosomes, altered glycosylation of SARS-CoV cellular receptor and the synergistic action of immunomodulation properties [131].\uf0b7 The Department of Science and Technology (Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province) reported a multicentric collaborative in vitro and clinical study, use of chloroquine phosphate (dose 500 mg twice a day for 10 days) in mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [132]. The study included some advisories to monitor for history of drug contraindication, blood testing for anemia, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f thrombocytopenia or leucopenia, serum electrolyte disturbances, tests for hepatic and renal functioning, routine electrocardiography and monitoring for visual and mental disturbances. Concurrent administration of some drugs should avoided including drugs which can prolong QT interval (examples: quinolones, macrolides, ondansetron), antiarrhythmic, anti-depressant and antipsychotic drugs. \uf0b7 The Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical disease, Lombardy section suggests administration of chloroquine (500 mg, twice a day) or hydroxychloroquine (200 mg per day for 10 days) (5 to 20 days treatment depending on clinical severity) [133]. \uf0b7 Another guideline as documented by the Dutch Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommended use of chloroquine to treat severe infections with requirement of oxygen therapy and optimal supportive care [134]. The recommended dose for chloroquine base is 600 mg followed by 300 mg after 12 hrs (on day 1) and 300 mg twice a day (for 2 -5 days) and discontinuation of the treatment at day 5 to reduce the side effects (30 hr halflife of chloroquine) (500 mg of chloroquine phosphate = 300 mg of chloroquine base). \uf0b7 In China, more than two dozen clinical trials have been carried out for evaluating efficacy various anti-viral drugs in different disease severity to investigate dose and duration of treatment. The studies have been coordinated by the Chinese authorities through a prescribed regulating guideline [135]. These trials are the first to report the characteristics and management of COVID-19 infected patients but no details on use of chloroquine[136][137][138][139][140].",
