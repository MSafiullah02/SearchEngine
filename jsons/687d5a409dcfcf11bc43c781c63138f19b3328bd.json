Egyptian scholars recognized that local inflammation was responsible for fever. In 1868, Billroth (1829-1894) attempted to confirm this ancient observation by injecting pus into animals, thereby producing a febrile response. In 1943, Menkin carried out similar experiments and isolated a product termed \"pyrexin\" [1] . Beeson in 1948 isolated a fever-inducing substance from a leukocyte, leukocyte pyrogens, which later became known as endogenous pyrogen (EP). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) was first identified as a cytokine by Gery and Waksman and proved to be identical with EP [2] .",

            "text": "\u2022 Fever (pyrexia) is a regulated body temperature above the normal range occurring as a result of IL-1-mediated elevation of the hypothalamic set point. Once fever is established, body temperature is regulated, as in health, by a net balance between heat production and loss. \u2022 Hyperthermia is an unregulated elevated body temperature above the normal range due to imbalance between heat production and loss. Interleukins are not involved and therefore the hypothalamic set point is normal. \u2022 A pyrogen is a substance (infectious organisms or their product toxins or cytokines) that provokes fever. \u2022 Exogenous pyrogens are substances, which originate outside the body and which are capable of inducing interleukins. \u2022 Endogenous pyrogens are substances, which originate inside the body and which are capable of inducing fever by acting on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre. IL-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (INF) are endogenous of albumin and transferrin decreases. Characteristically there are a decreased concentration of iron and zinc and an increased copper concentration. The low iron is the result of reduced intestinal assimilation of iron and increased liver storage of iron. These changes contribute to host defence by depriving invading micro-organisms of essential nutrients, such as iron and zinc. The process is referred to as nutritional immunity. \u2022 Cytokines are proteins produced throughout the body, mainly by activated macrophages, monocytes and T cells to regulate the immune responses within the body, control inflammatory and haematopoietic processes and may induce fever. As they enter the circulation and act on distant organs, they are considered as hormones. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, granulocytes-macrophages colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF) are responsible for initiating an effective defence against exogenous organisms (e.g. activating neutrophils). Their overproduction may be harmful by causing shock, multiple organ failure and death. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-4, IL-10) antagonize the pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus promoting healing and reducing inflammation. \u2022 Monokines are cytokines that are produced by mononuclear phagocytic cells.",

Typical chemokine is CXCL-8 that attracts neutrophils. \u2022 Interleukins are cytokines, acting specifically as mediators between leukocytes, hence their name. Their number known nowadays is enormous: at least 37 interleukins have been identified. If their amino acid sequence is known, they are assigned an interleukin number. If their sequence is not known, then they are named according to the biological property. IL-1 and IL-6 play a major part in the pathogenesis of fever. \u2022 Lymphokines are cytokines that are secreted by lymphocytes to regulate the immune response. Important lymphokines are IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-14 and TNF-gamma. \u2022 Prostaglandins are lipids that are made at sites of infection and tissue damage to produce inflammation and fever as part of the healing process. \u2022 Acute-phase response is the term used for haematological, endocrinological and metabolic changes that follow (within hours or days) the onset of fever in response to infections or local damage to a tissue. These changes are induced by several cytokines (IL-6 being the primary inducer), which are beneficial to the host. During the response, various acute-phase proteins, notably C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A, are synthesized by hepatocytes and released into circulation in large amounts. CRP plays a role in complement activation, opsonization and increasing platelet aggregation. Although acutephase response is closely associated with fever, CRP levels can be normal in viral infections and high in diseases without fever (e.g. tumours). Syntheses of albumin and transferrin and the concentration of iron and zinc decrease, while copper concentration increases. The low iron is the result of reduced intestinal assimilation of iron and increased liver storage of iron.

The active components of endotoxin are lipid and carbohydrate (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), which are the major components of the outer membrane of these bacteria. Endotoxin causes a dose-related progressive increase in temperature. In severe cases, it causes shock with vasodilatation, capillary leakage and hypotension. Septicaemia caused by Gram-negative endotoxin does not elicit fever in certain situations such as neonates, young infants or children with fulminating infection or with malnutrition. These children may present with normal temperature or even hypothermia in response to severe infection. Mortality is significantly higher in septic children [3] and adult [4] patients due to reduced capacity to release TNF-\u03b1 and IL-\u03b2 upon infection with LPS. \u2022 Gram-positive bacteria.

Certain steroids, however, are pyrogenic in human such as etiocholanolone, a major metabolite of testosterone and 17-ketosteroid, which induce the release of interleukin-1. Etiocholanolone produces fever only when injected intramuscularly (not intravenously). Etiocholanolone fever is characterized by recurrent fever for few days, in association with arthralgia, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, high ESR and etiocholanolone level.
