The accuracy of the report was validated by comparison with data generated natively by our laboratory information system, as well as a manual review of all test results from 1 day.

Forty-six percent (55/120 on December 25, 2017) of these molecular tests were positive for any respiratory pathogen. Vendor supply stocks were limited nationwide [5], and in January 2018, our supply of universal transport media diminished, requiring the creation of 1:3 aliquots to preserve material for sample collection. Based on these data and following CDC/World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for epidemics [2, 3], our primary care group stopped testing for influenza and treated symptomatic patients as if they were influenza positive. Our interactive website provided near real-time data, which allowed this decision to be made a week earlier than otherwise would have been possible using federal and state data. Furthermore, our inpatient pharmacy was able to anticipate oseltamivir utilization and stock accordingly while remaining prepared for potential drug shortages.",

The population tested includes all inpatient and outpatient individuals across our 8-hospital system (2264 operating beds) and all patients in the associated free-standing emergency and primary care clinics. The report is available to any device with an Internet connection and is updated daily to provide critical data to clinicians, epidemiologists, infection prevention and control committees, hospital leadership, and the public. We developed the site with mobile devices in mind, which allows the graphs and fonts to be readable on any platform. The user can switch between daily and weekly data aggregations using radio buttons. The time interval of interest can be modified using preconfigured buttons. Data can be filtered by clicking the data labels in the chart legends. These features are possible because of our decision to develop a web-based report, as opposed to a PDF, spreadsheet, or word processing document. Anecdotal feedback collected at the time of rollout was universally positive. Interest in the report quickly peaked after the initial announcement but continued to be viewed daily. As the influenza season ended, infectious diseases clinicians asked that we add a rhinovirus/enterovirus trend to the website so they could track the summer respiratory virus season as well. At least 1 clinician changed ordering practice in early September 2018 after identifying a spike in rhinovirus/enterovirus positivity frequency. In November 2018, the Chief Physician Executive and Specialty Physician Group CEO sent an e-mail to physician leaders across the system regarding a significant uptick in respiratory syncytial virus isolates and rising influenza A pathogens detected by laboratory testing, which was identified through our website report.",
