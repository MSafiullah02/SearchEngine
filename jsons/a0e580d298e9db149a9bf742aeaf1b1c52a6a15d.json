Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuously rising, with 2,328,095 laboratory-confirmed cases and 160,515 deaths worldwide as of April 19, 2020 . Although the overall case fatality rate (somewhere around 4.1% in early results) of COVID-19 seems to be lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), nearly 14% of patients are critically ill and demand massive intensive care resources. 1 A large-scale outbreak of COVID-19 will potentially paralyze some fragile health systems.",

It is important to accomplish COVID-19 triage and preoperative evaluation as quickly as possible. During the epidemic, for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS) classification I and II patients, it is recommended to conduct preoperative anesthesia evaluation through the electronic medical record. For American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) III and IV patients, face-to-face preoperative anesthesia evaluation is still recommended. In well-controlled regions (with intensive infection source control, strict community containment, and intensified active surveillance) with sporadic new cases, patients with epidemiological history or clinical symptoms related to COVID-19 are recommended to receive chest computed tomography (CT) scan, complete blood count, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test 6 ; in the regions where the epidemic situation is not effectively controlled (with a large number of new cases), it is recommended that all emergency patients should receive chest CT scan, complete blood count, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Critical patients whose condition does not allow chest CT scan should be treated as suspected COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise. Special attention needs to be focused on the differential diagnosis of CT manifestation between pulmonary contusion (when consistent with the mechanism of injury) and COVID-19 infection. In case of difficulties in differentiation, enhanced levels of protection should be used. In the epidemic outburst area (with a large number of confirmed cases and a booming number of new cases), level 3 protection should be implemented in all emergency surgeries due to increased risk of encountering asymptomatic patients, infected patients in the incubation period, or patients with false-negative screening results. Because the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab specimens has a low sensitivity, a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen (with a positive rate of 93%) might be considered after intubation. The result may better guide postoperative treatment. 7 Treatment of critical trauma patients with COVID-19 infection is challenging. Patients with minor symptom may progress into severe cases during hospitalization. Early identification of high-risk patients can reduce the risk of adverse outcome. 8 The treatment of patients with severe trauma must not be delayed due to COVID-19. The workflow of COVID-19 triage for emergency surgery during the epidemic is illustrated in Figure 1 .",

All COVID-19-related emergency surgeries should be performed under strict infection precautions. Anesthesia should be performed by a senior anesthesia clinician with another one on standby in the anteroom (yellow area) to provide further assistance. For patients with ASA III and IV classification or predicted difficult airway, an experienced expert should be available to assist. Detailed infection precautions for health care workers (HCWs) during anesthesia should be consistent with Perioperative Management of Patients Infected With the Novel Coronavirus issued by the Joint Task Force of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists. 5 Anesthesiologists should implement level 3 protection for surgical patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 ( Figures 2 and 3 ). Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned and doffed in a strict order according to one's specific institutional guidelines and under careful supervision of an infection control officer. Recommended PPEs for different levels of protection is shown in Table. It should be pointed out that use of PPE will inevitably hinder the visual, hearing ability, and hand dexterity of anesthesiologists, which will impair monitoring accuracy and the success rate of anesthesia procedures. 9",

Operation can be performed when the negative pressure reaches \u22125Pka or lower. 10 Warning signs of COVID-19 should be placed outside the OR. During the operation, it is necessary to keep the OR closed and restrict the number of HCWs who pass through the door. All unnecessary devices should be removed from the OR before surgery. Necessary devices, such as computers, anesthesia machines, and telephones, should be covered with disposable plastic wrap. The central suction system should not be used, and a substitute electric suction device is recommended. Adequate medications and fluids should be prepared before the surgery and placed in the OR away from the operating area. choice of anesthesia should be based on the patient's overall situation, trauma condition, and needed surgical treatment. Regional anesthesia is preferred if it can meet the needs of surgery. Patients receiving regional anesthesia can use oxygen through a nasal cannula, with a surgical mask on top and a suction tube placed next to the mask. But for patients who are already on high-flow nasal oxygenation or mechanical ventilation or who have other indications for endotracheal intubation due to COVID-19, 3 general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation should be applied. It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system. According to recent studies, SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in patients' cerebral spinal fluid and corpses' brain tissues. 11, 12 Some patients also demonstrated symptoms of intracranial infection, such as headache, epilepsy, and consciousness disorder. 12 Therefore, for patients with viremia, neuraxial procedures that breach the dura may carry a theoretical risk of viral translocation, although early experience from the hospitals in Wuhan did not show meningoencephalitis related to neuraxial anesthesia in COVID-19 patients. 9 Because no guidelines have been established regarding the safety of neuraxial procedures, the decision should be made after discussion among anesthesia, surgery, and infectious disease colleagues and following a thoughtful discussion with the patient. Furthermore, nearly 20% of patients with COVID-19 have coagulopathy, and almost all the severe and critical patients have coagulation dysfunction. 13 These conditions may represent a contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia.",

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have received intense attention because of positive results from small studies. 14 But chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have many side effects, including toxic myopathy, retinal impairment, and even heart injury in rare cases. Some animal studies showed that administration of chloroquine could increase the severity of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced neuronal apoptosis and memory impairment. 15 There is also evidence showing that treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir may significantly increase the placental transfer of bupivacaine enantiomers during epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. 16 Therefore, we suggest that thorough preoperative medication history should be collected, and special attention should be paid to the side effects of the COVID-19 treatment and its potential interactions with anesthetics. Furthermore, there has been speculation that consumption of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs might worsen the consequences of infection. 17 But strict avoidance of these drugs is ill advised, because there is no clinical evidence supporting these hypotheses yet.",

Anesthesiologists should pay special attention to the airway evaluation, because cervical spine injury, airway injury, and difficult airway are common in trauma patients. Patients with COVID-19 may suffer from respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia or even respiratory failure. Therefore, delays during tracheal intubation and multiple attempts at laryngoscopy may increase the risk of complications, including severe hypoxemia, cardiac arrest, and death. 18 To shorten intubation time and increase \"first-pass success\" rate, intubation should be performed by experienced anesthesiologists and facilitated by video laryngoscope. 19 When intubating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, sufficient neuromuscular relaxant should be applied to eliminate cough reflex; aerosol-producing procedures like suctioning should be avoided if possible. Modified rapid sequence induction is recommended for emergency trauma patients. We recommend cricoid force be applied by an experienced assistant to patients with high risk of gastroesophageal reflux. For suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, cricoid force should be used with caution because it may cause pharyngeal reflex, while its utility in preventing aspiration remains controversial. Propofol and rocuronium are reasonable drug choices for rapid sequence induction. Etomidate might be used in hemorrhagic shock patients, but its immunosuppressive effects are a relative contraindication to use in COVID-19 patients. Bag mask ventilation should be avoided after induction, while ventilation with low tidal volume and high frequency is recommended in case of severe hypoxemia. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, proper positioning of the endotracheal tube should be confirmed by chest movement and a waveform of end-tidal carbon dioxide (Etco 2 ), rather than by auscultation. For patients with difficult airway, guidelines for difficult airway management should be followed. For patients with difficult intubation, but without difficult oxygenation, the most familiar airway devices (bronchoscope, video laryngoscope, or light wand) to facilitate endotracheal intubation after anesthesia induction were chosen. For patients with high risk of \"cannot intubate and cannot oxygenate,\" cricothyroidotomy or tracheotomy directly was proceeded. For patients complicated with hemodynamic instability, proper vasopressors should be prepared before induction.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome is one of the main clinical manifestations in severe COVID-19 patients, and pulmonary contusion is common in emergency trauma patients. Perioperative lung-protective ventilation strategy is recommended to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury. During surgery, lung compliance, airway pressure, oxygen index, and arterial blood gas should be monitored closely, to provide guidance for optimal ventilator settings. According to Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh Edition), small tidal volume (6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight) and low plateau pressure (\u226430 cm H 2 O) with permissive hypercapnia are recommended, except for patients with known or suspected brain injury. 3 In the setting of plateau pressure \u226435 cm H 2 O, a proper level of positive end-expiratory pressure can also be used. To reduce viral contamination to the anesthesia machine and maintain heat and moisture within the breathing circuit, high efficiency particulate air filters should be installed between the mask and the breathing circuit and at the expiratory end of the breathing circuit. Considering the amount of airway secretions, endotracheal suction using a closed system should be performed regularly. Recruitment maneuvers 3-5 times/h are recommended to reduce atelectasis. The pressure used for recruitment maneuvers should be tailored to the compliance of the patient's lung.",

Because the asymptomatic rate of the infected COVID-19 patients is high and the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is long, we suggest that all the extubation should be performed in the OR, rather than in the postanesthesia care unit. The number of HCWs in the OR should be restricted during extubation. Level 3 protection should be provided to HCWs extubating COVID-19-related patients, and level 1 or 2 protection to HCWs extubating non-COVID-19 patients. Before extubation, suction of the lower airway and oropharyngeal sections should be performed with the patient in an adequately deep plane of anesthesia. Administration of propofol, dexmedetomidine, or remifentanil can be used to minimize the cough reflex during extubation. [24] [25] [26] For COVID-19 patients, laryngeal mask exchange (Bailey maneuver) technique, which involves the replacement of an endotracheal tube with a laryngeal mask, is another way to create a smooth extubation. The Bailey maneuver can maintain a patent and unstimulated airway and allow for stable physiological observations and protection of the airway from soiling secondary to blood and secretions in the mouth. 27 This technique is superior to either awake or deep extubation for patients with irritable airways. After extubation, COVID-19 patients should be monitored for at least 20-30 minutes in the OR and then be transferred to the isolation ward directly. Non-COVID-19 patients can be transferred to the postoperative care unit with a surgical mask in place for further recovery before transportation to the general ward.",

The incidence of thrombosis among patients with multiple traumas is as high as 50%, and pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of death for patients surviving the first 3 days after trauma. 28 Acute inflammatory reaction caused by COVID-19 can affect coagulation and fibrinolysis by several means, such as decreasing the level of circulatory protein C and antithrombin-III, and upregulating of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These changes can further activate the coagulation cascade and inhibit fibrinolysis, thus promoting thrombosis. 13 Therefore, perioperative thromboprophylaxis is of vital importance for trauma patients with COVID-19. Lin et al 21 recommended that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant therapy, together with highdose intravenous immunoglobulin, could be given to COVID-19 patients as early as possible when T cells, B cells, inflammatory cytokines, and d-dimer show the following trends: T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood are significantly lower than before; inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are increased significantly; coagulation parameters such as d-dimer are increased abnormally; and chest CT indicates the expansion of lung lesions. 21 They recommended that anticoagulation therapy should be initiated in COVID-19 patients when the d-dimer value was 4 times higher than the normal upper limit, unless obvious anticoagulant contraindications were present. The recommended dose of LMWH is 100 U/kg weight per 12 hours by subcutaneous injection for 3-5 days. However, for patients with high risk of postoperative hemorrhage or renal insufficiency, LMWH should be used with caution. Previous evidence has shown that early administration of tranexamic acid safely reduced death from severe bleeding in trauma. 29 Therefore, early administration of tranexamic acid may be reasonable in traumatically bleeding patients with COVID-19. But when bleeding is not life-threatening, the thrombotic risk of tranexamic acid is too poorly documented to justify exposing COVID-19 patients to a plausible and inadequately evaluated risk.",

Determination of COVID-19 status should be sought in the emergency department and verified again by the anesthesiologist before surgery. For suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, surgeries should be performed in negative pressure ORs in designated hospitals, by HCWs applying level 3 protection. In the epidemic outburst regions, HCWs should apply level 3 protection in every emergency surgery, regardless of the results of COVID-19 testing.

During the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, most hospitals have postponed elective surgeries. However, some emergency surgeries, especially for trauma patients, are inevitable. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, a standard protocol addressing preoperative preparation, intraoperative management, and postoperative surveillance should be implemented to avoid nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of patients and the health care workforce.
