Revealing the influencing factors affecting transmission of COVID-19 is essential to take effective control measures. Several previous studies suggested that the spread of COVID-19 was likely associated with temperature and/or humidity. But, a recent extensive review indicated that conclusions on associations between climate and COVID-19 were elusive with high uncertainty due to caveats in most previous studies, such as limitations in time and space, data quality and confounding factors. In this study, by using a more extensive global dataset covering 578 time series from China, USA, Europe and the rest of the world, we show that climate show distinct impacts on early and late transmission of COVID-19 in the world after excluding the .

(which was not certified by peer review) : medRxiv preprint confounding factors. The early transmission ability of COVID-19 peaked around 6.3\u00b0C without or with little human intervention, but the later transmission ability was reduced in high temperature conditions under human intervention, probably driven by increased control efficiency of COVID-19. The transmission ability was positively associated with the founding population size of early reported cases and population size of a location. Our study suggested that with the coming summer seasons, the transmission risk of COVID-19 would increase in the high-latitude or high-altitude regions but decrease in low-latitude or low-altitude regions; human intervention is essential in containing the spread of COVID-19 around the world.",

We plotted the 6.3\u00b0C isocline of COVID-19 in January, April, July and October in Fig. 3E . It is notable that countries or regions with heavy infection rates of COVID-19 are mostly located within the isoclines of 6.3\u00b0C (the optimal temperature for COVID-19) from October to January. From winter, spring to summer, the 6.3\u00b0C isocline moves from subtropical to temperate, arctic zone; while from summer, autumn to winter, it back moves from arctic to temperate, subtropical zone (Fig. 3E) . The seasonal movement of the 6.3\u00b0C isocline of COVID-19 along latitude or altitude increases the transmission risk of COVID-19 in different climate zones.

The whole genome of the COVID-19 virus has a high similarity (96%) with that of a coronavirus isolated from bats in Yunnan, China (Zhu et al., 2020). However, the natural hosts carrying the virus of COVID-19 and their habitats remain unclear. The area with the 6.3\u00b0C isocline between October and January should be investigated as a priority in the search for the natural hosts of COVID-19, their habitats and migration routes. Our study indicated that both human and climate factors played a significant role in the spread of COVID-19. It is not wise to rely upon climate factors to control this dangerous virus. Human intervention, such as lockdown and travel restrictions at the epicenter, as well as identification and isolation of infected patients or people with close contact, have been demonstrated to be successful in preventing the spread of COVID-19 (Tian et al., 2020). Thus, human intervention is essential to contain the rapid expansion of COVID-19 around the world. More efforts and collaboration are urgently needed in containing the spread of COVID-19 around the world.",
