The oil price reaction to COVID-19 was gradually accommodated until March 09, 2020, when, 49 days after the release of the first coronavirus monitoring report by the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia floods the market with oil. As a result, international prices drop with more than 20% in one single day. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 numbers on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of financial volatility and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty. Our ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily reported cases of new infections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the long run. Nevertheless, by amplifying the financial markets volatility, COVID-19 also has an indirect effect on the recent dynamics of crude oil prices.",

In addition, COVID-19 creates fear and additional stress on financial markets, where the price volatility is continuously increasing. Anticipating a strong decrease in the global demand in the next period, Saudi Arabia starts an oil price war on March 09, 2020, and floods the market with oil. In one single day, the crude oil price plunges with more than 20%. This shock spills over financial markets that crash during the same day (the Black Monday).",

Oil prices influence the forecasts of macroeconomic variables and therefore the US EPU. At the same time, policy-induced uncertainty influences the asset prices in general, including oil prices. Therefore, recent papers investigate the both sides of the coin, looking to the reverse causality between the oil price and the EPU, and reporting mixed findings. A first set of papers (e.g. Antonakakis et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2017) shows that oil price shocks impact the US EPU. A second set of studies underlines, on contrary, that US EPU dynamics triggers movements in international oil prices (Aloui et al., 2016; Yang, 2019) .",
