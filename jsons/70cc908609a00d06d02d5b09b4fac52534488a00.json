Not controlling such disasters brings about severe disruptions in the supply chains and communities and, thereby, irreparable losses will come into play. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these disasters that has caused severe disruptions across the world and in many supply chains, particularly in the healthcare supply chain. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, develops a practical decision support system based on physicians' knowledge and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in order to help with the demand management in the healthcare supply chain, to reduce stress in the community, to break down the COVID-19 propagation chain, and, generally, to mitigate the epidemic outbreaks for healthcare supply chain disruptions. This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure). Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed approach was measured in the real world using the information from four users and the results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.",

Fever, tiredness, and dry cough are among the most common symptoms of this virus (Huang et al., 2020; Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020; . Patients may also exhibit nasal congestion or a runny nose, aches and pains, sore throat, or diarrhea. These symptoms generally do not begin with severity; they may develop little by little. In fact, some infected individuals may not even feel unwell and, hence, remain unaware that they are contagious. Most affected people recover from the disease without any specific treatment and hospitalization. About 17% of COVID-19 sufferers experience severe illness and breathe with difficulty. People of higher age and those with underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure, are at greater risk of suffering more seriously from its negative effects (United Nations, 2020).",

            "text": "One of the problems now confronting societies is the lack of equipment to successfully encounter this virus. This virus propagates rapidly, so any failure in dealing with its prevalence dramatically increases the number of infected people. If communities are faced with a shortage of medical/healthcare equipment, an increase in the number of infected people can initiate an irreparable and incredible catastrophe. The provision of some strategies and solutions to reduce the outbreak rate of this disease, and the coordinated management of infected people, can lead to the breakdown or deceleration of the virus chain since no definitive cure has been identified for the disease at this point. Healthcare equipment and services, such as coronavirus testing kits, masks, gloves, etc. are not available to all the people in the society. Therefore, an effective way to make optimal use of the available healthcare equipment and to manage the demands in the healthcare supply chain is to identify and classify the individuals with and without and, accordingly, to propose instructions/regulations for each class. Generally, the main purpose of this study is to respond to the following research questions: How is it possible to develop a decision support system in order to classify community members for the management of demand in the healthcare supply chain? How to disrupt the virus chain itself? How to control the outbreak of an epidemic to mitigate its impact on the healthcare supply chain?",

            "text": "This paper proposes a decision support system based on physicians' knowledge and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in order to classify community members with the objective of managing demand in a healthcare supply chain and breaking down or decelerating the virus chain. As a highly practical tool, FIS has been proposed on the basis of expert knowledge in the realm of fuzzy set theory in order to deal with the nonlinear mapping of input to output variables. Since COVID-19 is a new disease and reliable datasets pertaining to this disease are not available, it is desired to use the FIS approach, which is based on expert knowledge. In addition, the input and output variables in this approach do not follow a linear function; therefore, FIS makes it possible to define the proper functions (rules) for different conditions. This is another rationale for the employment of FIS in this paper. The healthcare chain proposed in this paper is a two-echelon chain, including community members (service recipients) and the healthcare system (service providers). In this supply chain, healthcare equipment and services provided by the healthcare system are considered as the product. The structure under study of the healthcare supply chain is shown in Figure 1 . In the proposed approach, any sudden increase of demands in the healthcare supply chain is first prevented based on regulations notified to each class. Secondly, disruptions must be mitigated in this chain. In addition, community members' stress is reduced when the reach of the COVID-19 virus decreases. To increase the accuracy of the proposed decision support system, criteria including age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure) have been considered in addition to the three main criteria of fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Generally, the contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:",

In contrast to most disruption threats and risks, epidemic outbreaks are minor at the outset, but they develop and spread over various geographic areas very quickly (He and Liu, 2015) . The latest pertinent examples include MERS, SARS, Swine flu, Ebola, and the newest one, coronavirus. The COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan, China and quickly affected the Chinese economy; as a result, supplies in worldwide supply chains were considerably diminished. Accordingly, Araz et al. (2020) has asserted that the outbreak of this viral disease is one of the most critical disruptions to occur in recent decades and, thereby, it is ravaging a large portion of supply chains across the world.",

Thus, for future research, it is recommended that other criteria such as diarrhea, vomiting, etc. be added to input variables in order to design a more accurate decision support system and to increase the number of membership functions of input and output variables as well. In this paper, an expert-based approach was employed to control epidemic outbreaks. It is recommended to use the integrated data science and expert knowledge to propose an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for the control of epidemic outbreaks. Moreover, the decrease of the disruptions caused by epidemic outbreaks in supply chain network design by using scenariobased stochastic programming model can be an interesting and practical topic to be explored in future works.

However, the spread rate of the SARS virus and China's role in the critical situation of SARS totally differed from that of the current COVID-19 virus; accordingly, SARS had lower adverse effects on the SCs. Similarly, the spread of the Ebola virus badly affected worldwide logistics (BSI, 2014). In this regard, Buyuktahtak\u0131n et al. (2018) and Calnan et al. (2018) shed some light on the valuable experiences obtained while Ebola virus was dominant.

However, if the same user belongs to the sensitive group, he/she will be hospitalized but does not require intensive care.
