In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, experts used these data for SARS and MERS as a reference and estimated the incubation period for COVID-19 to be 2\u201314 days (4, 5). However, Zhong et al. reported a patient whose reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) result became positive on the 24th day after known contact (6). Furthermore, 9/80 patients' diagnoses were unconfirmed until their third nucleic acid test (7). Thus, the optimal duration of isolation is still unknown. The typical chest computed tomography (CT) imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple patchy ground glass opacities in multiple lobules bilaterally with a peripheral distribution (8). The imaging findings are normal in some patients with early stage infection, pulmonary abnormalities developing as the disease progresses (9). However, the rate of imaging changes in the lungs and the risk of lesions in each lobe are unclear. Compared with the cases in Hubei province, affected patients outside Hubei, China, have exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. There are few published studies on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and chest imaging findings of patients infected with COVID-19, especially in areas outside Hubei province. We therefore performed this retrospective study to provide more data about COVID-19, including the timeline for clinical symptoms and virological conversion and chest radiological abnormalities.",

Most of these 18 patients were diagnosed during observation as inpatients because they were close contacts. The longest interval from contact to RT-PCR-positivity was 18 days, which may mean that the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is longer than is currently believed. A longer isolation time is therefore required (Figure 2C). The median time from admission to the first positive RT-PCR throat swab was 0 days (\u22122 to 12). Although one patient was first found to be RT-PCR-positive on the 12th day of admission, 89.4% (76/85) patients tested positive for RT-PCR within 1 day of admission (Figure 2D), indicating that the scope of screening needs to be extended to maximize identification of asymptomatic carriers.",

Patients encountered fever could be a predictor of abnormal chest imaging findings (P = 0.016, Table 2). Comorbidities tended to be present more frequently in those with chest CT abnormalities than in those without them (cardiovascular disease 16 [26.2%] vs. one [4.2%], endocrine disease eight [13.1%] vs. one [4.2%], respiratory disease three [4.9%] vs. one [4.2%], digestive tract disease three [4.9%] vs. none [0%], and malignant tumor three [4.9%] vs. one [4.2%]; however, these differences were not statistically significant (Table 1). In addition, 10 of the 24 patients with normal imaging findings on admission developed pulmonary abnormalities on CT as the disease progressed, such patients being older than those with persistently normal chest CT scans (median age, 38 [33\u201369] vs. 29 [1-65] years, P = 0.089).

The disease spread to other areas from around the end of January to February. Because medical departments were by then alert to the importance of extensive screening and early detection and isolation of infected individuals, these patients' symptoms were mild at the time of admission to hospital.

The typical imaging manifestations of COVID-19 are similar to those of SARS, namely, ground glass opacities in the lung parenchyma in the early stages and areas of consolidation in the later stages, some of which are round, the lesions are mostly distributed on the periphery of the lung (15). On admission, 71.8% (61/85) patients had abnormal imaging findings. These patients were older than the other 28.2% (24/85) patients who had normal CT scans (P = 0.031). However, we detected no predilection for male vs. female patients, and found no differences in other clinical features between the two groups. Pathological changes can occur in both lungs, mainly in both lower lobes, and the risk of infection in the left lower lobe is 13.8 times higher than that in the right middle lobe. This conclusion is consistent with Salehi's research (16), and we speculate that it may be due to the physiological structure of the right middle lobe. In addition, whether there is a difference in gene expression in the right middle lobe leads to different susceptibility, which requires further study of pathological data and in-depth study of the mechanism.",

Possibly because our study cohort is too small, our findings do not reflect the time differences in imaging lesions. It is also possible that some patients were in clusters, as having experienced close contact between an initially diagnosed patient being found to have pulmonary lesions on CT scans.
