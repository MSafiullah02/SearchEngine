In this issue, we glance behind the scenes of dental stem cell preservation for potential therapeutic use, and discover that cancer cells hijack podoplanin expression to induce thrombosis. Moreover, we learn how the helicase DDX17 promotes tumour stemness, how genetic defects in meiosis and DNA repair cause premature ovarian insufficiency, and that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor is associated with several psychiatric diseases. Further accounts relate the role of miR-95-3p in colorectal cancer, the protective power of eggplants against mercury poisoning, and the predictive value of inhibin A for premature delivery. Finally, the very rare case of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the external auditory canal receives some attention, and we get to read up on how 3D imaging and modelling combines functional and aesthetic repair of cleft lip and palate cases.",

Given that both the amount and the differentiation potential of ASCs seem to decline with age [6] , the trend is to harvest the earliest available cell material with the largest differentiation spectrum. The prime examples are haematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the umbilical cord [7, 8] . Notably the latter are currently used in countless clinical trials [9] , and kicked off the tissue cryobanking business. As a consequence, in 2018, over 450 companies worldwide offered cord blood banking services. 3 Securing this cell source however is possible only during an extremely short time window and relies on the individual's parents' sole decision. Therefore, more and more alternative ASC sources have been explored over the recent years. A good example was discussed in a recent issue of the Biomedial Journal, where we discovered the promising potential of locally derived MSCs derived for the repair of anterior cruciate ligaments [10, 11] .",

The major particularity of PDPN though is that it does not possess any functional domains or enzymatic activities on its own. Instead, it exerts its \"activities\" by interacting with numerous molecules present either on the same cell surface as PDPN, or on neighbouring cells. Examples include the C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2), CD44, or protein kinase A (PKA) [26] . In particular, activation of CLEC-2 by PDPN on lymphatic endothelial cells or fibroblastic reticular cells triggers platelet activation and aggregation, which is necessary for the accurate separation of blood and lymphatic vessels [27] , and cerebrovascular patterning [28] .",

In the cancer setting, PDPN is said to promote migration, invasion, metastasis, proliferation and clonal capacity [25, 26] , yet the underlying mechanisms are forcefully dependent on its binding partners. Notably, little is known about PDPN's ability to induce platelet aggregation in a tumour context. Lee et al. concentrate here on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a highly lethal cancer type with over 300 000 new cases per year and 50% of patients dying within 5 years [29] . The authors confirm the expression of PDPN in five out of nine OSCC cell lines, before focusing on the commonly used OECM-1 line. One interesting observation is that the average PDPN levels are not due to a homogeneous expression, but that the cell population can be further separated into P\u00fe cells with high and P-with low or absent PDPN levels. This immediately echoes the frequent detection of cellular heterogeneity within the same tumour, with stem cell-like tumour initiating subpopulations as the most intensely researched -and controversial -case [30] . Stable and efficient knock-down by small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) of PDPN is subsequently achieved in the P\u00fe fraction, with no impact on cell morphology, and surprisingly also no alteration of cell proliferation, in contrast to some previous reports [25, 26] . Nevertheless, as PDPN function depends on its interaction partners, substantial differences in phenotypes could be due to different triggered pathways.",

Aggregation of human washed platelets was only observed after substantial overexpression of PDPN in P\u00fe cells, raising again the question if other factors are required for the molecule to deploy its full potential, especially as aggregation takes places with platelet and cancer cells, and is inhibited by PDPN knock-down. In due course, the authors turn in vivo, using a real-time monitored ectopic xenograft model in immunocompromised mice. The previous observation that PDPN expression does not have an effect on proliferation holds true in the mouse model, as knock-down of the protein in P\u00fe cells does not change tumour growth and metastasis compared to the mock shRNA. Nonetheless, survival is considerably shortened in the control compared to mice injected with PDPN knock-down cells. Notably, these animals showed platelet infiltration into the primary tumour, intravascular platelet aggregation, and presented multiple signs of increased intravascular thrombosis activity.",

However, no significant increase in thrombosis markers is noted, leading once again to the possibility that an unknown co-factor modulates PDPN function. Lee et al. hypothesise as a matter of fact that the P\u00fe and P-subpopulations differ in more ways than their PDPN expression levels, and that the P-fraction lacks the partner required for PDPN to trigger coagulation.",

Nonetheless, just as much as different cancer types display highly divergent properties, and strong heterogeneity even among the same tumour class, the role of a certain miRNA can be contrasting depending on the context. MiR-95-3p has already been studied in many cancers, and been found to act either as an oncogene [46] , or as a tumour suppressor [47] , depending on the dominant mechanism. Hong et al. extend the list by investigating here the role of miR-95-3p in colorectal cancer (CRC) [48] . The authors show that miR-95-3p expression is lower in CRC cell lines and tumour tissue compared to normal intestinal cells or adjacent tissue. Moreover, patients with the lowest miR-95-3p expression levels displayed worse recurrence survival and overall survival rates. Overexpression of miR-95-3p inhibited cell proliferation and mobility of CRC cells in vitro, as well as tumour growth and metastasis in a mouse xenograft model, and improved the survival of the latter. The hepatomaderived growth factor (HDGF) was identified in silico as a putative target for miR-95-3p, and subsequently validated by several assays. According to these results, miR-95-3p qualifies as a tumour suppressor in CRC, and could be a reliable prognostic biomarker from early stages on, while HDGF might represent a therapeutic target.",

It took quite some time to recognise the highly harmful effects of mercury, notably on the nervous system [51] -as proven by Minamata disease, the neurological disorder caused by methylmercury released into the industrial wastewater by the Japanese Chisso chemical factory until 1968 [52] . Nowadays, the main sources of human exposure are dental amalgams, occupational exposure, or contaminated fish [53] . Eggplants, on the opposite, are not only delicious on pizza, but fully loaded with health benefits in the form of vitamins, phenolics and antioxidants [54] . Moreover, as shown here by Adelakun et al., feeding rats whole eggplant extract in parallel with mercury chloride reduces significantly the testicular toxicity of the latter by boosting the organism's antioxidant system [55] .",

Early detection of preterm labour is key for adequate prevention and management, however, the underlying causes are complex and multi-factorial. Known risk factors encompass infections, stress, multiple gestations, or maternal body weight -yet about two-thirds of PTB cases lack an apparent predisposition [57] . Measurement of cervical length is so far one of the most reliable and cost-effective methods [58] , but over the past decade, much effort was made to additionally identify biomarkers predictive of spontaneous PTB in maternal blood at earlier stages [59, 60] . Until now, it has been considered quite unlikely that a single test would be sufficient for predicting PTB [61] , however data gathered by Huang and colleagues strongly indicate that maternal inhibin A levels from the second trimester are a good candidate [62] . Inhibin is a glycoprotein and probably named during a peak moment of pragmatism, as it inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, in unsurprising contrast to activin [63] . So far, it has been used as a biomarker for ovarian cancer [64] and Down syndrome [65] . Huang et al. show here that inhibin A levels over 2.25 are statistically significant in their association with preterm labour [62] , and might thus be an early clue prompting closer monitoring of the patients.",

Numerous genetic defects and environmental factors can lead to defaults in the final fusion steps, leading among others to a cleft lip and/or palate. Besides problems with feeding, dental occlusion, speech and infections, the condition entails a heavy psychosocial burden, exemplified by the severely biased depiction of individuals with an orofacial cleft as villains in works of fiction. 8 Early surgery usually achieves the re-establishment of functional features and satisfying facial aesthetics. Nevertheless, both goals can sometimes be conflicting. Multiple articles in the recent issues of the Biomedical Journal have illustrated that the patient's pre-and post-operative opinion and satisfaction are more and more considered for orthognathic surgery [70, 71] . Hence, Denadai et al. explain in this issue's editorial note how three-dimensional imaging and computer-aided modelling of the surgery outcome, in combination with the taking into consideration of the patient's, or patient's family's, preferences has improved the outcome of orthognathic orofacial cleft surgery both in terms of functional and aesthetic outcome [72] .",
