            "text": "There is ongoing debate and lack of consensus around the use of respiratory protection for HCWs for respiratory diseases, including influenza, which is reflected in inconsistencies between policies and guidelines across healthcare organizations and countries (Chughtai et al., 2013). In the healthcare setting facemasks (medical/surgical masks) are generally used to protect wearers from splashes and sprays of blood or body fluids and to prevent spread of infection from the wearer, while a respirator is intended for respiratory protection (Siegel et al., 2007). The mode of disease transmission is one factor which influences the selection of facemasks or respirators \u2013 for example, facemasks are recommended for infections transmitted through contact and droplets, while respirators are recommended for airborne infections. Such guidelines are based on often tenuous theoretical principles informed by limited experimental evidence, given the lack of data drawn from the complex clinical environment. Transmission is not fully elucidated for many infections, spread can occur by multiple modes and the relative contribution of each mode may not be precisely quantified. Further, host related factors can mediate the severity of the disease. Some diseases exclusively transmit through the airborne route in natural setting (e.g. tuberculosis), while other diseases mainly transmit through the droplet or contact modes but short range respiratory aerosols are generated during high risk procedures which increases the risk of infection transmission (Roy and Milton, 2004). For example, the primary mode of influenza transmission is thought to be droplet (reflected in guidelines which largely recommend surgical masks), but there is increasing evidence that it is also spread by short-range respiratory aerosols (Bischoff et al., 2013, Tellier, 2009). For Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), data supported both droplet and airborne transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014a, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014b, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014c, Yu et al., 2004). Airborne precautions have even been recommended for measles and varicella-zoster viruses despite a lack of data (Siegel et al., 2007).",

One of these had only 32 subjects (Jacobs et al., 2009), and one had 446 subjects (Loeb et al., 2009). The largest RCTs conducted (by authors CRM, HS and colleagues) on N95 respirators and masks, with 1669 and 1441 subjects, respectively, showed a benefit associated with using N95 respirators and failed to show any benefit of surgical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2011, MacIntyre et al., 2013). In one of the trials, the majority of laboratory confirmed infections were with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza, neither of which are thought to be predominantly airborne (MacIntyre et al., 2013). These data support the concept that transmission of viruses is multimodal and caution against dogmatic paradigms about pathogens and their transmission, particularly when the disease in question has a high case-fatality rate and no proven pharmaceutical interventions.",

However, this is based purely on the fact that they have superior filtration capacity, and can filter smaller particles. The guidelines fail to consider that respirators offer the additional benefit of being fitted, therefore creating a seal around the face. It is also possible that the seal achieved by a respirator may be an additional benefit over and above the superior filtration that they offer. Respirators are not regulated by fit however, only on filtration capacity (with filtration of airborne particles being the sole consideration in guidelines), but the seal offered by a respirator adds to the protection when compared to other mask types. The risk of infection with respiratory pathogens increases three-fold during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as intubation and mechanical ventilation (MacIntyre et al., 2014a). Respirators are generally recommended in these situations for diseases that are known to be transmitted though the droplet route such as influenza and SARS (Chughtai et al., 2013), so the fact that they are not recommended more broadly for a disease with a much higher case-fatality rate such as EVD, is concerning.",

There is some evidence from experimental animal studies that EVD can be transmitted without direct contact; however these studies generally do not differentiate between droplet and airborne transmission (Dalgard et al., 1992, Jaax et al., 1995, Johnson et al., 1995). In one study, six monkeys were divided into three groups and each group was exposed to low-dose or high-dose aerosolized EV and aerosolized uninfected cell culture fluid (control), respectively. All four monkeys exposed to EV developed infection (Johnson et al., 1995).

In one study, monkeys without direct contact contracted EBV from infected pigs in separate enclosures (Weingartl et al., 2012). It was not clear whether transmission was due to respiratory aerosols or large droplets. The first infection occurred in a monkey caged near the air ventilation system and positive air samples identified through real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which raised the possibility of airborne transmission. However, pigs cough and sneeze more than humans and thus have more capacity to generate aerosols. Furthermore, in pigs EVD mainly affects the lungs while in primates, it mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted in the faeces. As with influenza, the transmission characteristics of EVD may also change due to temperature and humidity, and it should be noted that the experimental studies on EV transmission were conducted at low temperature and humidity, which might have favoured aerosol transmission. A recent study has shown that nonhuman primate to nonhuman primate transmission is mainly through contact, with airborne transmission being unlikely (Alimonti et al., 2014).",

Although the CDC does recommend a respirator during AGPs for EVD patients, aerosols may be created in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures. Evidence suggests that aerosols from vomitus can transmit norovirus, and SARS was likely transmitted via faecal aerosols (Barker et al., 2004, Marks et al., 2003, McKinney et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2004). Staff contacts of two HCWs infected with Ebola in 1996, who were treated in South Africa, took universal precautions, with respirators used for high-risk procedures, and no further cases occurred in 300 potential contacts (Richards et al., 2000). The report of this outbreak (by author GAR) has been cited in support of the WHO and CDC guidelines (Klompas et al., 2014), however in South Africa one HCW contracted EBV when using normal surgical attire during placement of a central line in a patient with undiagnosed EBV. This occurred despite no obvious lapse in infection control. In contrast, once EBV had been diagnosed in the HCW, respirators, impermeable one-piece suits and visors were used (according to South African guidelines), and no further infections occurred despite procedures such as intubation, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, central line placement and the insertion of a Swan Ganz catheter (Richards et al., 2000).",

            "text": "When determining recommendations for the protection of HCWs, guidelines should not be based solely on one parameter, the presumed mode of transmission. A risk-analysis approach is required that takes into account all relevant factors which could impact on the occupational health and safety of HCWs (Fig. 1\n). The severity of the outcome (case-fatality rate and disease severity) must be considered. Any level of uncertainty around modes of transmission must also be evaluated, particularly if the disease has a high case-fatality rate. In addition, the availability of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment must be considered. The immune status and co-morbidities in HCWs should also be considered, as some HCWs may be innately more vulnerable to infection. As the ageing of the nursing workforce occurs in developed countries, there is likely to be a high proportion of HCWs with chronic conditions. In this case, facemasks have been recommended for HCWs by CDC and WHO because of the assumption that EV is not transmitted via the airborne route. However, there is uncertainty about transmission, the consequences of EVD infection are severe, there is no proven treatment, vaccine or post-exposure prophylaxis. Recommending a surgical mask for EVD has much more serious implications than for influenza, which has a far lower case-fatality rate and for which there are easily accessible vaccines and antiviral therapy. Further, numerous HCWs have succumbed to EVD during this epidemic, including senior physicians experienced in treating EVD and presumably less likely to have suffered lapses in infection control (World Health Organization, 2014d, World Health Organization, 2014e, World Health Organization, 2014f). Aside from these factors, it is also important to consider the perspectives of the staff member. In this highly stressful situation, staff members will want to be reassured that they are using the highest level of protection and are not putting themselves and their families/colleagues at risk. This is especially important if the outbreak escalates and additional staff members are required to assist. Staff may refuse to treat patients unless they feel adequately protected.",

Why then, during the worst outbreak of EVD in history, with the most virulent EV strain and with hundreds of HCWs succumbing to the disease is it considered adequate for them to wear surgical masks?

There is RCT evidence for respirators (but not masks) providing protection against non-aerosolised infections, (MacIntyre et al., 2013) and an abundance of evidence that transmission of pathogens in the clinical setting is rarely unimodal. Where uncertainty exists, the precautionary principle (that action to reduce risk should not await scientific certainty) should be invoked and guidelines should be consistent and err on the side of caution. Moreover, a clear description of risk should be provided to HCWs (Jackson et al., 2014). Given the predominant mode of transmission, every HCW death from Ebola is a potentially preventable death. It is highly concerning that a recent commentary suggests HCWs do not need a mask at all \u201cto speak with conscious patients, as long as a distance of 1\u20132 metres is maintained\u201d(Martin-Moreno et al., 2014). This fails to consider the changeability and unpredictability of the clinical environment and disregards the rights of the HCW. It is also unrealistic to believe a HCW can constantly keep track of their distance from a patient in the hectic acute care setting. We accept that cost, supply and logistics may, in some settings, preclude the use of respirators, but guidelines should outline best practice in the ideal setting, with discussion about contingency plans should the ideal recommendation be unfeasible. Importantly, in the absence of sufficient evidence, recommendations should be conservative and estimation of risk considered. Recommendations should be developed using a risk analysis framework, with the occupational health and safety of HCWs being the primary consideration.",
