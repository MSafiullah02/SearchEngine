            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), belongs to the family Coronaviridae and causes acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality rates in neonatal piglets (Lee, 2015.). PEDV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in size, and it possesses four structural proteins: the glycosylated spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) proteins and the unglycosylated nucleocapid (N) protein (Jung and Saif, 2015). PEDV has circulated throughout Europe and Asia during the past four decades, and has caused devastating impacts on world pig-rearing industry (Collin et al., 2015). Currently, vaccination is the primary measure for prevention of PEDV. However, genetic variants have been identifying in Asia, Europe and North America since 2010 (Hanke et al., 2015; Horie et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2013; Lee and Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2012; Sung et al., 2015; Trujillo-Ortega et al., 2016; Vui et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2013;), which makes current traditional inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines are less effective against circulating PEDV variants (Choi et al., 2009; Lee, 2015). The lack of effective therapeutic treatment underlines the importance of research for new antivirals.",

Antiviral effects of LiCl have been extensively investigated. LiCl can inhibit the infection of some DNA and RNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (Skinner et al., 1980), canine parvovirus (Zhou et al., 2015), porcine parvovirus (Chen et al., 2015), pseudorabies herpesvirus (Sui et al., 2010), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Hao et al., 2015), feline calicivirus (Wu et al., 2015), infectious bronchitis virus, an avian coronavirus (Li et al., 2009) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus (Ren et al., 2011). Both PEDV and TGEV are classified into group I of the genus Alphacoroavirus. However, it remains unknown whether LiCl has inhibitory effects on PEDV infection. In this study, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of LiCl on PEDV infection. Moreover, the effect of LiCl on the cell apoptosis induced by PEDV was investigated. These data indicated that LiCl might be a potential compound for reducing PEDV infection.",

Real-time quantitative PCR, targeting the S gene of PEDV was carried out with the primers shown in Table 1\n, using a Lightcycler 1.5 Real Time PCR System (Roche, Germany) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Janpan) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The relative RNA expression levels were calculated by the 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct method, using beta-actin as an internal control for normalization. The mean RNA level of the mock-treated group was set at 1.00.",

However, some viruses possess the ability to actively induce apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of viral progeny to neighboring cells for further invasion, which are important biological parts in viral pathogenesis and disease processes that promote cell death and tissue injury (DeDiego et al., 2011; Favreau et al., 2012; Lan et al., 2013). PEDV induced caspase-independent apoptosis through activation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor has been demonstrated (Kim and Lee, 2014). In this study, we re-confirmed that PEDV infection induced the appearance of apoptotic cells as shown by IFA, and most apoptotic cells were at a stage of late apoptosis at 48 h post-infection. LiCl had a potent inhibitory effect on PEDV-induced early and late cell apoptosis. This is in accordance with the results from TGEV, another porcine coronavirus (Ren et al., 2011). Regarding the action mechanisms of LiCl on cell infection by PEDV, our data implies that LiCl may inhibit PEDV infection via exerting an anti-apoptotic effect, since a caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptosis-mediated pathway plays a central role in PEDV-induced apoptosis to facilitate viral replication. This is conflict with the results of the expression of caspase-3 was inhibited by LiCl in TGEV-infected cells. Apoptosis-associated caspase activation of TGEV and SARS-CoV has been reported. Maybe LiCl can act on multiple factors in the apoptosis pathway or PEDV induces apoptosis through different pathway. However the exact action mechanism of LiCl on PEDV-induced apoptosis needs to be defined.",
