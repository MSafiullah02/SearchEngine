            "text": "Henipavirus, a genus of the paramyxovirus family, is responsible for several epidemics in some regions of Asia and Australia in the last few years (Aljofan, 2013, Field et al., 2007, Luby and Gurley, 2012). Viruses belonging to this group are deadly pathogens and are characterized by their zoonotic nature, broad host range, and ease of transmission from person to person (Mathieu and Horvat, 2015). Among three established species of the genus Henipavirus, Nipah Virus (NiV) and Hendra Virus (HeV) are responsible for causing lung disease and encephalitis in pigs, horses and humans, while the other, the most recent member of Henipavirus, Cedar Virus (CedPV) is harmless (Luby et al., 2009, Middleton, 2014, Marsh et al., 2012). Pteroid fruit bats and microbats are the common reservoir of Henipavirus (Croser and Marsh, 2016). Upon contact with the bats, domestic animals develop infection and further transmit the virus to human. Environmental changes, destruction of bat habitats through deforestation, and genetic diversification have been implicated as the reasons behind the emergence and re-emergence of the viruses in recent time (Clayton et al., 2013).",

During all outbreak events, the horses were infected first and subsequently transmitted to human. Approximately, one hundred horses were affected by the virus with a fatality rate of 70%. In case of human, four out of seven infections became fatal along with influenza-like symptoms in all patients. While some of them recovered from the viral infection, others either developed pneumonitis or encephalitis or even multi-organ failure (Blum et al., 2009). NiV was identified relatively later in 1999 during an outbreak in pig farms. The event was responsible for 257 human infections, including 105 confirmed deaths (Field et al., 2001). Eight more outbreaks of NiV have occurred since then in Bangladesh and India (Chadha et al., 2006). In an outbreak in February, 2011 in the northern region of Bangladesh, 17 out of 24 NiV infected persons died (Chua et al., 2000, Chua et al., 2002, Hughes et al., 2009). The number of outbreaks and re-emergence of Henipaviruses imply its high potency as pathogen which can evolve further by the interplay between the genome of the virus species during growth and multiplication in the common host.",

The genome of the Henipavirus is \u223c18.2 kb long, non-segmented, single stranded negative sense RNA, which encodes six genes corresponding to six structural proteins (Wang et al., 2001). The core of the virus is composed of RNA, which is tightly bound to nucleocapsid (N) protein and associated with large (L) and phosphoprtein (P). F (fusion) and G (attachment) proteins are embedded within the lipid membrane. The role of the G glycoprotein is to attach the virus with the surface of a host cell through a highly conserved mammalian protein, EFN B2 (Bonaparte et al., 2005, Negrete et al., 2005). The F protein helps to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane, which allows the release of the virion into the cell.",

None of the several attempts that have been made could develop a successful treatment option. For example, Ribavirin was tested to treat animal models infected with NiV and HeV, but showed no significant increase in the survival rate of the animals (Gurley et al., 2007, Homaira et al., 2010). Monoclonal antibody has also been an attractive treatment option. A neutralizing antibody, mAb m102.4, targeting the glycoprotein domain of the virus that binds to ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 receptor of host, has already been tested (Bishop et al., 2007, Negrete et al., 2006, Pasquale, 2008). In vivo experiment has shown enhanced survival of the animals challenged with HeV and NiV (Plotkin, 1999). In addition to these post-exposure treatment options, some recent studies have been able to successfully induce immunity against Hendravirus by injecting animals with a fragment of G protein working as a subunit vaccine (Guillaume et al., 2004, Guillaume et al., 2006, Guillaume et al., 2009, Weingartl et al., 2006). Assessment of the vaccine in non-human primates revealed its potential for human use, but it has not been studied in human so far (Mire et al., 2014). Nevertheless, no universal vaccine has yet been developed that works against all Henipaviruses irrespective of their genetic differences.",

The 3D structures of the selected peptides were generated using the PEP-FOLD Peptide Structure Prediction server (Thevenet et al., 2012, Maupetit et al., 2009). PEP-FOLD uses a de novo approach to predict peptide structure from amino acids, ranging from 9 to 36 residues. This method is based on a Hidden Markov Model derived Structural Alphabet (SA) letter coupled the predicted series of SA letters to a greedy algorithm and a coarse-grained force field (Thevenet et al., 2012). SA letters descibre conformations of four consecutive residues. The best models provided by the server were chosen for the docking study. HLA-C 12*03 was found to interact with most of the predicted T cell epitopes. For this reason, the 3-D model of HLA-C 12*03 was generated using SWISS MODEL server (Biasini et al., 2014). The homology-modeling method comprises following four steps: (i) template selection; (ii) target template alignment; (iii) model building; and (iv) evaluation (Schwede et al., 2003). These steps can be iteratively repeated, until a satisfying model structure is obtained. The HLA-C 12*03 \u22123D model was evaluated by PROCHECK software (Laskowski et al., 1993) and ProSA web tool (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007). Ramachandran plot (Laskowski et al., 1993), constructed using the PROCHECK software assesses the stereo-chemical quality of 3-D structure analyzing residue-by-residue geometry and overall structure geometry. ProSA tool provides a Z-score which is a measurement for the quality of the model (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007).",

Computer-simulated ligand docking is a powerful technique for evaluating relative binding affinity of the ligand toward its receptor (Patronov and Doytchinova, 2013). The AutoDOCK tool from the MGL software package was utilized for the docking purpose (Morris et al., 1998, Morris et al., 2009). At first, both the allele (HLA-C 12*03) and ligand (epitope) files were converted into PDBQT format to use them for the docking study. The grid/space box center was set at \u221215.059, \u22123.063, and \u221226.955 \u00c5 in the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively, which allows the predicted epitopes to bind to the binding groove of the selected MHC class I. The size was set at 20, 40, and 40\u00b0 A in the x, y, and z dimensions, respectively. The 3D structure of MHC class I H-2Kb molecule complexed with the octapeptide, KVITFIDL (PKB1), was employed as a positive control for the binding assay. The complex structure was resolved at 2.3 \u00c5 by X-ray differaction method.The binding of octapeptide to H-2Kb molecule causes a tremendously large conformational change to be readily reconiged by a T-cell receptor (TCR) (Reiser et al., 2016). This conformational change renders a good platform to analyze docking simulation assay. First, the octapeptide was separated from H-2Kb and then it was docked with H-2Kb and selected the MHC class I molecule by setting similar parameters. Binding energy for control peptide was calculated and compared with the energy found for the predicted T cell epitopes. All the analyses were done at 1.0 \u00c5 spacing and complexes were visualized using Discovery studio 4.1 (Anon., 2013).",

The rationale behind the epitope based vaccine is the chemical synthesis of identified B cell and T cell epitopes, that are immunodominant and can generate specific immune responses (Patronov and Doytchinova, 2013).

Hence, at first, we determined the degree of conservation of G protein. MSA and absolute variability site analysis demonstrated that G protein is highly conserved in Henipavirus. Several B cell epitope prediction methods have been developed in recent years, but performances of prediction of these methods are still far from ideal (Greenbaum et al., 2007). To avoid the false positive, we utilized four different B cell epitope prediction methods and only the nine epitopes which were found common to all prediction were selected for further analysis. B cell epitopes must be accessible enough to bind to antibodies for eliciting immune responses (Caoili, 2010). Here, we identified the surface peptides and compared these peptides with the selected B cell epitopes. From the conservation analysis of seven B cell epitopes, it was found that four B cell epitopes are fully conserved. The flexibility and accessibility are two key requirements for a B cell epitope to be a vaccine. LAEDDTNAQKT and NYTRTTDNQ, two conserved B cell epitopes were found to be highly flexible in nature, but only LAEDDTNAQKT epitope was found to be hydrophilic.",

Two conserved T cell epitopes, LTDKIGTEI and NSLGQPVFY, were found to interact with the HLA-C 12*03 allele with high affinity. We further utilized computer-simulated molecular docking to investigate the intermolecular interaction. From the results of docking simulation assay, it was found that the binding energy of the LTDKIGTEI epitopeis \u22126.8 kcal/mol, which is almost similar to the binding energy of the control peptide. As lower binding energy favors stable intermolecular interaction, LTDKIGTEI could be a potential epitope. We strongly believe that nontoxic property of these two epitopes can bypass the toxicity related problem of peptide based vaccine. Stability and antigenicity can be further enhanced conjugating these epitopes with the adjuvant (Olesen et al., 2009). To address the questions regarding actual immunogenicity, stability, efficacy, and delivery strategy inside the recipient bodies of these epitopes, in vitro and in vivo experiments are essential.",
