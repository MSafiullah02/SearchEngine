Anecdotal evidence from our clinics and media suggest many are struggling with overeating.

Our analysis bears out these hypotheses. Once BMI or body fat was adjusted for, inflammatory markers were no longer associated with incident COVID-19.

However, they allowed a direct comparison between COVID-19 and pneumonia in the same cohort. Due to the under-representation of non-white ethnicities in UK Biobank, we have limited power to explore important interactions by ethnic group (although Black ethnicity was associated with the outcome), and we recognise this as an important risk factor. Ascertainment bias, including differential healthcare seeking, differential testing and differential prognosis may explain some differences in outcomes given poor coverage of testing in the UK. It is also likely that cases will generally be at the more severe end of the clinical spectrum by using hospitalised cases as the outcome, although use of admission to ITU would be additionally informative once sufficient case numbers accrue. Despite this, we still observe many similar risk factors to incident pneumonia, which is more likely to have close to complete case ascertainment in primary care records, although, as discussed, other risk factors seem more strongly linked to COVID-19 infections. Exposures were measured several years before the development of the outcomes, and misclassification of the exposures will likely bias our results to the null. However, this also serves to illustrate that the risk factors were generally present many years before development of the disease, and as is well known, risk factors tend to track with age. We have also been unable to fully exclude all deaths that occurred prior to the pandemic, due to lack of up-to-date linkage to mortality records.",
