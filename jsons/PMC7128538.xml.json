            "text": "3 years after the first identified case of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, no specific treatment with proven effectiveness exists. More than 1600 people infected with the virus from 26 countries have been reported to WHO, including more than 600 related deaths.1 As a result of a large hospital outbreak at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,2 between August and September, 2015, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs organised a 2 day research initiative workshop on Sept 9\u201310, 2015, to make recommendations for therapeutic (panel 1\n) and non-therapeutic (panel 2\n) research on MERS-CoV. Recognising the crucial role of scientific and political partnerships, the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs invited key representatives of regional and international health agencies and experts in basic and translational science, diagnostics, therapeutics, epidemiology, infection prevention and control, clinical research, and public health. Several pharmaceutical companies presented the status of MERS-CoV treatment candidates in development. Primary objectives were to exchange knowledge and prioritise potential treatments for assessment in clinical trials in Saudi Arabia.Panel 1Key recommendations for MERS-CoV treatment from the research initiative workshop\n\u2022Although much fundamental preclinical study has been done, further assessment of the most promising drugs with appropriate animal models is the optimum next step before clinical trials are started\u2022These preclinical studies should begin immediately, with clinical studies beginning soon after\u2022In view of the episodic nature of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in human beings and generally low numbers of cases at hospitals or health-care systems, international collaboration among scientists, clinicians, hospitals, extra-hospital health sectors, regulators, and funders is key for efficient and effective implementation of these clinical trials\u2022An efficient stepwise approach to the generation of scientifically valid clinical research has to drive and inform eventual incorporation of new treatments into clinical practice\u2022Relevant parties should continually assess progress, including a multisectoral follow-up meeting to incorporate the most advanced data to better inform the care of patients with MERS-CoV\u2022Standardised case report forms should be developed to accommodate observational studies and clinical trials, with tiered data collection requirements that reflect the varying capacity for research across different environments and the standard definitions of variables that allow data to be combined across multiple studies or trials.3, 4 These forms will help to create integrated databases that include epidemiological, microbiological, immunological, and clinical data; specimen repositories; and storage banks to inform subsequent MERS-CoV scientific inquiry\u2022With an understanding of the risks associated with development of a new treatment, researchers should use a portfolio approach to assess multiple complementary approaches and should prioritise the approaches that are most advanced in the scientific and development process for first assessment.\u2022A therapeutics research infrastructure should consider an adaptive clinical trial design that allows either efficient sequential or parallel assessment of treatments, in comparison with a concurrent control group\u2014 ideally taking the form of an allocation-concealed, randomised, blinded (to the intervention) clinical trial\u2022Outcomes and endpoints for clinical trials should be realistic. Although demonstration of a reduction in mortality is the ideal goal of any treatment-based clinical trial, the ability to validly show a mortality reduction can be hampered by the likelihood that an absolute mortality reduction greater than 5\u201310% is, historically, unlikely for many interventions and especially so when used after an infection has caused severe illness and organ dysfunction, and by the likely infeasibility for studies to enrol the thousands of patients necessary to show a less than 10% absolute reduction in mortality. Therefore, although measuring mortality is essential, trials should consider other important endpoints, including biological markers of effect (eg, viral load in biological samples), especially for early phase clinical assessments\nPanel 2Studies to address non-therapeutic research gaps for MERS-CoV from the research initiative workshop\nStudies in man\n\n\u2022Undertake population-based seroprevalence studies to improve understanding of the full extent and severity profile of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, as opposed to only detecting the sickest patients5, 6\n\u2022Study the serological response over time in patients infected with MERS-CoV to inform optimum sequencing of immunological and non-immunological-based treatments\u2022Identify specific and modifiable risk factors for MERS-CoV infection in primary patients infected from non-human sources, and in hospital infected cases (requiring control populations)1, 5\n\u2022Undertake collaborative case series and cohort studies to identify predictors and prognostic markers of worsening illness, which might help to identify at-risk patients for specific interventions\u2022Assess MERS-CoV associated pathophysiology through safely performed, substitute decision maker-consented biological specimen and post-mortem tissue sampling\u2022Improve understanding of the mechanisms and durations of viral shedding to inform physicians of the infectious potential of asymptomatic and clinically recovering patients\u2022Assess the modes of virus transmission in health-care settings, including viral endurance in the environment and the potential role of airborne and droplet transmission to human beings, to inform infection prevention and control measures1, 5\n\u2022Establish the operating characteristics of different specimens (eg, nasopharyngeal swab, induced sputum, tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, and blood) and diagnostic tests to achieve rapid, highly sensitive, and specific test algorithms to assist rapid and efficient case identification and treatment\u2022Establish viral kinetics over time in patients infected with MERS-CoV\u2022Assess the effect of adherence to infection prevention and control procedures in hospitals on nosocomial transmission risk\n\nStudies in animals and assessment of camel-to-human transmission\n\n\u2022Undertake prevention studies, including animal and human vaccine development\u2022Adopt one-health approach, including research to improve understanding of transmission at the animal\u2013human interface of MERS-CoV and the role of vaccines for both animals and human beings5\n\u2022Assess the potential for MERS-CoV to cause reinfection in dromedary camels and human beings after primary disease or vaccination, or both, and the characteristics leading to prolonged active infections\u2022Undertake anthropological studies to inform knowledge on animal\u2013human interactions and camel-to-human transmission\u2022Characterise the reservoir of infection in animals, including viral shedding in dromedaries and camel-to-camel transmission7\n\n",
