While not statistically generalizable, after examining several cases, the identification of the presence or absence of the best practices provides researchers with the arguments needed to find consistency about the situation that may have applicability to other similar risk situations. By using the case study framework to separate the pre-crisis from the crisis, observers may note events leading up to the crisis, factors that may have contributed to the way the risks were presented, and what happened (or should have happened) as a result of the way these messages were processed and acted upon.",

This compromised the local officials' credibility and accountability.

In essence, they claimed to be treating the situation as a potential crisis, while at the same time indicating their belief that the threat was a hoax. Managing crisis uncertainty became the focus for local leaders as they presented messages minimizing the risk as a hoax while acknowledging their treatment of the message as a viable threat to the security of the cattle and the New Zealand economy. The pre-crisis partnerships established between crisis managers and the various stakeholders proved valuable as the agencies worked together to disseminate information and communicate with the local citizens, as well as New Zealand's international partners. While a crisis plan was in place, and had been tested, there were some initial concerns raised by the local public that were ultimately mitigated due to open communication, as well as an attitude of compassion and empathy demonstrated by crisis spokespeople.

In addition, ConAgra made overly-assuring statements to the public about which products were affected by Salmonella(chicken and turkey), and which were not (beef). The assumptions made by ConAgra Foods about the literacy levels, economic status, access to media, proximity to outbreak, and cultural group identities of those receiving the risk messages also complicated their communication with stakeholders.

Five cases were introduced: the Milwaukee Cryp-tosporidiumcrisis, the Hurricane Katrina crisis, the New Zealand foot and mouth disease hoax crisis, the Odwalla juice crisis, and the ConAgra Foods Salmonellacrisis. In each case, the best practices of risk communication provide insight into what occurred, or failed to occur, and the implications that followed in each crisis situation.",

            "text": "The five case studies provide insight into the best practices of risk communication. In all of the cases, risk communicators should have acknowledged competing arguments in the construction of risk messages. For example, the Cryptosporid-iumcase demonstrates the need to infuse risk communication into policy making. By accepting that current practices would take care of the problem, local leaders allowed the crisis to develop. In the Hurricane Katrina case, the dynamic state of affairs required communicators to continuously review the situation and be proactive in communicating strategies of self-efficacy. Regarding the New Zealand potential foot and mouth disease case, a clear argument exists for why risk communicators must acknowledge and reinforce the unknown when framing messages for the public. Similarly, the collaboration and coordination among agencies with credible information sources helped the New Zealand crisis leaders build support among the various stakeholders affected by the potential contamination. As for Odwalla, the company was forced to acknowledge diverse levels of risk tolerance as the complexity of the situation unfolded. Similarly, a recognition of the need for a culture-centered approach would have enhanced the communication of ConAgra Foods with consumers and demonstrated a commitment to safety over profit. The following five chapters serve as examples of case studies involving risk communication.",
