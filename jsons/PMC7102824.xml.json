There is a strong belief that MERS-CoV originated in bats as it is closely related to other \u03b2 coronaviruses affecting bats [9]. The fact that bats exposed to MERS-CoV through intranasal and intraperitoneal routes shed the virus in respiratory secretions without developing signs of the disease [10] provide evidence of bats being the natural reservoir of infection [2].",

Previous studies reported that cases of MERS-CoV could present with respiratory symptoms [20], [21] or gastrointestinal symptoms [20], [22]. Most of the confirmed cases in this study presented with symptoms of respiratory tract infection including fever, cough and shortness of breath rather than gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Almost all admitted patients were isolated in a room with negative pressure (93.17%) or in a single room (5.22%) to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection. Among cases in this study, only 14.86% were healthcare workers which can be attributed to the stringent infection control procedures applied in all healthcare facilities in response to the MERS-CoV epidemic in Saudi Arabia.",

Ahmed [30] noted the recent decrease in mortality rate among confirmed MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia and attributed the improvement of patients\u2019 outcome to the adopted prevention and control policies as well as the attention given to case management. The severity of MRS-CoV ranges from mild to fatal illness [20] and can progress rapidly to severe respiratory distress and death [32], [33]. Respiratory distress was noted in a proportion of MERS-CoV patients at the time they presented to the emergency department; 14.06% were on mechanical ventilation and 30.52% were breathing through oxygen mask. Condition of 43.78% of the patients required care in intensive care unit and 30.52% of them required mechanical ventilation. Lung lesions were detected in the chest radiography of nearly two-thirds of the patients, the commonest was pulmonary consolidation. Moreover, 12.05% developed renal problems that required continuous renal replacement therapy. All these factors were taken as a proxy of disease severity and was found to affect significantly the probability of these patients to be discharged alive. Most probably patients who did not visit any health facility and those who were not hospitalized before being admitted to PMAH had milder form of illness and consequently higher probability of being discharged alive.",

These diseases tend to affect older patients resulting in lower immunity which in turn leads to severe MERS-CoV infection and lower likelihood of survival as shown by this study and previous ones [23], [36]. In fact, younger age independently predicted survival after controlling for the effect of co-morbidities as well as other determinants of survival. The higher probability of survival among younger patients was also reported by Saad et al. [25] and others [22], [23]. Previous studies attributed the low risk of mortality from MERS-CoV among healthcare workers to the fact of being younger [32] and healthy with no history of any co-morbid conditions [32]. Also, their awareness of the risk of exposure may have prompted them to seek early diagnosis and treatment.",

The data compiled from the electronic medical records was used as well to estimate the case fatality rate and to identify the predictors of survival. This information may be used by healthcare providers to identify high risk patients in need for special medical attention in order to improve patients\u2019 outcome and survival. Nonetheless, the study has a number of limitation inherent to the retrospective charts review. As hospital charts are mainly used for the clinical management and follow up of cases, epidemiologic data necessary for the description of cases in relation to person, place and time were either missing or incomplete.
