Developing countries in Asia and Africa with fragile health system have shown lower incidence and mortality compared to developed countries with superior health system in Europe and America. Most countries in Asia and Africa have national BCG vaccination program while Europe and America do not have such program, or have ceased it. At present, there is no known therapy to treat COVID-19 disease. There is no vaccine available currently to prevent COVID-19 disease. As mathematical modelling is ideal for predicting the rate of disease transmission as well as evaluating efficacy of possible public health prevention measures, we have created a mathematical model with seven compartments to understand nationwide BCG vaccine recommendation on COVID-19 transmission, severity and mortality. We have computed two basic reproduction number, one at vaccine free equilibrium point and other at non-vaccine free equilibrium point and carried out local stability, sensitivity and numerical analysis. Our result showed that individuals with BCG vaccinations have lower risk of getting COVID-19 infection, shorter hospital stays, and increased rate of recovery. Furthermore, countries with long-standing universal BCG vaccination policies have reduced incidence, mortality, and severity of COVID-19. Further research will focus on exploring the immediate benefits of vaccination to healthcare workers and patients as well as benefits of BCG re-vaccination.",

Transmission of COVID-19, similar to numerous airborne respiratory viruses including tuberculosis and influenza, occurs through direct contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes or indirect contact through interaction with contaminated surfaces with respiratory droplets from infected person [2] . As of April 18, 2020, the disease has spread to 210 countries with 2,324,731 total confirmed new cases reported and 160,434 deaths [3] . Since currently there is no definitive treatment or an effective vaccine for disease control, there is a crucial need to find measures that cure or reduce morbidity due to COVID-19.

Although developing countries like India, Philippines, Sri Lanka reported their initial case in January, they have yet to experience extensive community spread [5] . In contrast, developed countries like Italy and United Kingdom have experienced high mortality and widespread infection despite strong curtailing of social interactions. Studies show a disproportionately smaller number of cases have been reported from disadvantaged and low-income countries [6] . It is puzzling that countries with more fragile health systems report less incidence of COVID-19. Figure 1 shows a figure from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control which indicates that much of the incidence of COVID-19 is in the developing countries such as United Kingdom and United States [4] . A possible explanation for lower number of cases detected in these developing countries with extensive travel and trade links to China may stem from the induced heterologous protective activity of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization [5] . The country used to recommend BCG vaccination for everyone, but currently does not. C: The country never had universal BCG vaccination programs [7] . Adapted from BCG World Atlas.",

            "text": "Vaccines provide protection from particular pathogens by inducing effector mechanisms directed towards that pathogen. Certain live attenuated vaccines like the BCG vaccine increase immunity against not only a particular pathogen, but also numerous unrelated pathogens that present with similar acute respiratory tract infections [8] . Previous studies have established that BCG vaccination confers non-specific protection via the induction of innate immune memory [9] . BCG is used widely across the world as a vaccine for Tuberculosis, with many developing nations having a universal BCG vaccination policy for new-born [10] . Studies have indicated that countries with uniform BCG vaccination policy show significantly lower COVID-19 cases and deaths per million people compared to countries where BCG vaccination policy was ceased or was never in place [5] . Figure-2 from the BCG world atlas shows that numerous developing countries currently employ a universal BCG vaccination program, while many developed countries have either ceased their BCG vaccination recommendation or never recommended it [7] . Comparison of Figures 1 and 2 also indicates that the largest number of COVID-19 cases are in countries that currently have no BCG vaccination recommendation. Furthermore, the year that universal BCG vaccination was established within a country has a significant correlation with the mortality rate, indicating that earlier implementation of the policy leads to protection of a larger fraction of the elderly population. For instance, although Iran currently employs a universal BCG vaccination policy, it was implemented as recently as 1984. Consequently, it reports an elevated mortality with 19.7 deaths per million inhabitants [6] . In contrast, Japan started its universal BCG policy in 1947 and has around 100 times less deaths per million people, with 0.28 deaths. Similarly, Brazil started universal vaccination in 1920 and also has an even lower mortality rate of 0.0573 deaths per million inhabitants [6] . Exploring this relationship between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 further is crucial in establishing a potential short-or long-term prevention measure that is effective in reducing incidence and mortality of COVID-19.
