Frail, elderly, and severely immune-compromised patients and adults with cardiopulmonary disease are also at high risk of infection by RSV, with relatively low viral load, making it difficult to detect, and RSV constitutes a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these populations (Falsey et al., 2005, van Elden et al., 2003, Yunus et al., 2010). Therefore, a highly sensitive, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective assay for detection in patients infected by RSV is extremely important.",

However, the detection limit of these assays for RSV is not yet adequate for assessing clinical specimens with a low viral load of RSV infection, resulting in false-negative diagnosis.

Positive and negative controls were included in each run.

LNA can be incorporated into DNA or RNA oligonucleotides to induce a local conformational change in the helix (Kaur et al., 2006). Upon LNA modification, the stability and affinity for DNA molecules are increased (Burbano et al., 2010), and the oligonucleotide melting temperature is also reportedly increased by LNA (Latorra et al., 2003). LNA modification has been used in many applications including single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis (Karmakar and Hrdlicka, 2013), real-time PCR probes (Osterback et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2007), antisense oligonucleotides (Wahlestedt et al., 2000), microarray probes (Castoldi et al., 2008), and PCR primers (Chen et al., 2016, Latorra et al., 2003). However, LNA modification has not been used in OTNRT-PCR by melting curve analysis. In the current study, we adapted and modified a previously described 2-step seminested RT-PCR process (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005) and developed an LNA-based OTNRT-PCR assay.",

In the initial cycles of the OTNRT-PCR assay, LNA-outer primers were annealed at a higher annealing temperature (64 \u00b0C), enabling hybridization of only the outer primers, and later cycles were carried out at a lower annealing temperature (52 \u00b0C), enabling hybridization of both the inner primers to the amplicons and the antisense oligonucleotides to the outer primers. The working concentration of each primer, the reaction parameters, and the running conditions of the OTNRT-PCR assay were optimized, and this enabled the detection of RSV with extremely high sensitivity while maintaining good specificity. Limiting the concentration of outer primers in PCR has been described as a way to improve the efficiency of 1-tube nested PCR (Erlich et al., 1991). In our study, LNA-outer primers were employed at a lower concentration than inner primers to minimize primer competition. The sensitivity of the commercial qRT-PCR kit in our study was 2.56 \u00d7 100 TCID50/mL with a Ct value of 34.48 (Fig. 3A), which is commensurate with the reported values (Sanghavi et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the sensitivity of the developed OTNRT-PCR assay was 1.02 \u00d7 10\u22121 TCID50/mL, which is equal to that of the 2-step nested RT-PCR assay and 25-fold more sensitive than qRT-PCR. The high specificity of the OTNRT-PCR assay for RSV was also retrospectively evaluated using 315 RSV-negative clinical specimens that were positive for other respiratory pathogens.",

As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4, 143 clinical samples detect by OTNRT-PCR assay were missed by qRT-PCR with CT > 35. Among them, 12 samples had a CT range of 35\u201340; 131 out of 446 samples were deemed to be negative for RSV by qRT-PCR but positive by OTNRT-PCR assay. This result suggests that the OTNRT-PCR assay is more sensitive than the qRT-PCR assay and retains the sensitivity of the 2-step seminested RT-PCR assay. It is possible that the higher sensitivity of the OTNRT-PCR assay could aid in the detection of clinical samples from adult patients infected with RSV suffering severe disease and/or a lack of immunity, resulting in possible low virus load of RSV (Walsh et al., 2001). Thus, the OTNRT-PCR assay may not only benefit earlier diagnosis of RSV infection in children but also prove effective for detection in cases of low virus load, thereby improving disease symptoms in older patients.",

Some studies have reported performing nested PCR in a single tube using fluorescent probes, gel electrophoresis, or spatial separation of outer and inner primer sets (Brisco et al., 2011, Dey et al., 2012, Hu and Arsov, 2014, Moser et al., 2012). However, our OTNRT-PCR assay can effectively prevent contamination and eliminate the need for post-PCR electrophoresis or the use of a fluorescent probe, and complete detection takes only 3 h. Furthermore, the running costs of the OTNRT-PCR assay are 10% less than the TaqMan probe qRT-PCR assay. The cost of the LNA-outer primers (~$0.06/reaction) is similar to that of common primers, and the SYTO9 reagent is much cheaper than a fluorescent probe. Therefore, the proposed assay offers the advantages of being highly sensitive, real time, rapid, cost-effective, and contamination-free.",

In conclusion, the developed OTNRT-PCR assay for detection of RSV using primers modified by LNA was more sensitive than a corresponding qRT-PCR assay. Given the treat of RSV epidemics, the OTNRT-PCR assay could be used to detect RSV in patients earlier and could assist in the monitoring of therapy and disease prognosis, thereby reducing mortality in patients. Moreover, this LNA modification-based design provides a powerful strategy for converting existing 2-step nested PCR methods to OTNRT-PCR assays for other infectious agents.",
