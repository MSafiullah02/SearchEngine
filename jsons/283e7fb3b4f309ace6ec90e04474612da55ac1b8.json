Methods: Twenty-seven patients who completed both pulmonary function and maximal aerobic capacity tests at 6 and 15 months after the acute illness were invited to return for reassessment. Results: Twenty-one patients (median age 18.2 years, interquartile range (IQR) 16.5-19.7) completed all investigations at 36 months. Pulmonary function was normal in all patients. Maximal aerobic capacity, peak oxygen pulse (peak VO2) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold showed significant improvements compared with values measured at 6 months in both boys and girls. In girls, ventilatory efficiency (ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide) and perfusion of the lungs (end-tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure) had not increased further compared with the values measured at 15 months. Although peak VO2 improved further at 36 months in patients with or without persistent radiological abnormalities, the values were 68% (IQR 50-84) and 74% (IQR 60-99), respectively, of those for normal control subjects. Conclusions: There were improvements in aerobic capacity at 36 months in children affected by SARS; however, the measured values remained suboptimal.",

[1] [2] [3] The spectrum of disease and its progression are very different in children compared with adults. No fatalities have been reported among children, and the clinical course and radiological changes were much milder. [4] [5] [6] All subjects from a cohort of 47 paediatric SARS patients showed complete clinical recovery 6 months after diagnosis, and lung function was normal in >90% of these patients. 7 A reduction in aerobic exercise capacity 3 months after hospital discharge has been reported in some adult SARS survivors. 8 There was persistent impairment in adults at 6 and 12 months after onset of the illness. 9 , 10 We previously reported that aerobic capacity was impaired at 6 and 15 months after the diagnosis of SARS in a cohort of 47 children. 11 The mechanism of reduced aerobic capacity in children affected by SARS is not fully understood, but it is probably a consequence of impaired perfusion of the lungs during peak exercise as well as deconditioning. In the present study, aerobic capacity and pulmonary function were examined in the same group of children at 36 months, and comparisons were made with the values measured 6 and 15 months after the acute illness.",

[8] [9] [10] 19 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exam-ining the later stage of recovery (36 months) in children and adolescents who contracted SARS coronavirus. The main finding from the present study was the persistence of suboptimal aerobic capacity 36 months after the initial acute illness. Impairment of aerobic capacity has been reported in adult SARS patients. [8] [9] [10] 19 Such impairment was consistently shown to be at variance with the lung function of these subjects, which was either normal or showed only mild abnormalities. We reported that aerobic capacity, as reflected by peak VO2, was reduced in a cohort of asymptomatic children 6 and 15 months after the acute episode of SARS. We postulated that this impairment was the result of reduced perfusion of the lungs during peak exercise as well as deconditioning. 11 The present results showed that peak VO2, both in absolute terms and relative to body mass, increased significantly between 6 and 36 months in all subjects, most likely indicating recovery in these subjects. 20 With regard to the lowest value of peak VO2 in a group of local 'healthy' adolescents (26 mL/kg/min), 21 43% of the 21 patients in the present study had peak VO2 values below 25 mL/kg / min at 6 months, as compared with 14% at 15 months and 6% at 36 months, reflecting reversal of the impairment in peak VO2 in these patients. Ventilatory anaerobic threshold is the most frequently used measure of submaximal exercise response, 22, 23 and the changes in ventilatory anaerobic threshold were in keeping with the changes in peak VO2, reinforcing the notion that aerobic capacity did improve over time in all subjects. However, peak VO2 values at 36 months in patients with normal and abnormal HRCT findings were only 74% and 68%, respectively, of the predicted values for age and gender determined by Armstrong and Welsman, 14 and these values would still be considered suboptimal.",

            "text": "The recovery of aerobic capacity at 36 months in girls can partly be explained by the normalization of ventilation parameters and blood oxygenation in the lungs. At 6 months, patients were noted to have inefficient ventilation, as reflected by significantly higher peak ventilatory equivalent for oxygen values compared with normal control subjects. 11 In the present End-tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure provides a reliable non-invasive estimate of PaCO2, 24 and a low end-tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure value would indicate a high degree of alveolar V/Q mismatching. 15 A marked increase in end-tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure was noted in girls from 6 months to 15 months after the acute episode, but there was no further significant increase at 36 months. This finding supports the hypothesis that improved oxygenation of blood in the lungs plays a role in the documented improvement in aerobic capacity among girls. Furthermore, it would suggest that recovery of any pulmonary deficit due to SARS coronavirus infection had been established and was complete by 15 months. Whether exercise training and/or pulmonary rehabilitation would further enhance recovery is unknown. Peak oxygen pulse is a surrogate marker for cardiac function, and provides an indication of stroke volume and arteriovenous difference. 15 Peak oxygen pulse was significantly reduced at 6 months in children recovering from SARS, as compared with healthy control subjects, 11 whereas peak oxygen pulse values increased markedly at 36 months. Lin et al. demonstrated that peak oxygen pulse increased with increasing age in both girls and boys. 25 It is possible that pronounced deconditioning as a result of SARS resulted in a decline in stroke volume, and the low peak oxygen pulse at 6 and 15 months also supported this. Increases in peak oxygen pulse at 36 months may be the result of cardiac remodelling in response to the resumption of normal activities of daily living; however, in a study of adult SARS survivors who had a more severe disease course, stroke volume remained unaffected. 26 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the improved peak oxygen pulse at 36 months in both boys and girls was more likely due to normal growth and development, rather than being associated with recovery from SARS. Arteriovenous difference is dependent on the availability of Hb, on oxygenation of blood in the lung and on the extraction of oxygen in the periphery. 15 Based on the fact that (i) patient Hb levels were within the normal range, 27 (ii) all patients achieved their target peak heart rate during the maximal exercise test, (iii) none of the patients had received a prolonged course of corticosteroid treatment, and (iv) normalization of breathing efficiency and oxygenation of blood in the lungs were established by 15 months, it is unlikely that increases in peak oxygen pulse could be explained by improvement in arteriovenous oxygen difference.",

            "text": "Aerobic capacity was suboptimal in these patients at 36 months after the initial illness. Individuals with low aerobic capacity may experience limitation in sustaining more demanding activities, as peak VO2 is strongly correlated with time spent performing highintensity leisure-time physical activities. 28 Aerobic capacity also contributes to cardiac workload and is associated with the growth of the heart during childhood and adolescence. 29 If aerobic capacity is per-sistently suboptimal in this group of patients, it is possible that the development of the heart would be hindered in these younger patients, as a result of insufficient cardiac workload stimulation of the left ventricle. Low aerobic capacity is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 30 It may, therefore, be beneficial for patients to participate in a well-structured moderate-to-high intensity exercise training program aimed at improving peak VO2. In adult SARS patients, aerobic capacity was shown to improve significantly after a 6-week supervised exercise program. 31 There were certain limitations to this study. First, data from only 21 out of a possible 47 patients were analyzed at 36 months. Aerobic capacity was poorer at 6 months in patients who did not return for reassessment than in those who did return. A lack of motivation, and difficulty in sustaining a relatively highintensity workload during the previous exercise test, may have deterred some patients from returning for reassessment. Second, detailed assessments of physical activity were not performed for these patients. Changes in conditioning and in the habitual physical activity of these patients during the study period may also have contributed to changes in aerobic capacity at 36 months. However, to our knowledge, none of the patients participated in any routine exercise training during the study period. It is likely that the activity patterns of these patients were similar to those of other Hong Kong youngsters, which have been shown to be low. 32, 33 Third, no comprehensive direct assessments of cardiac function were made. However, it is unlikely that there was any significant cardiac impairment as all subjects were normal at clinical examination and were able to achieve the maximum heart rates predicted for their age during peak exercise. Lastly, the reference values reported by Armstrong and Welsman 14 were used as local normal reference values for peak exercise tests were unavailable. McManus et al. 21 have shown that absolute peak VO2 values were considerably lower in younger Chinese girls and boys than in similarly aged Caucasian children; however, by adolescence, the values were comparable to the predicted values for children of corresponding ages, as reported by Armstrong and Welsman. Therefore, the effects of using normal reference values determined for a different racial group should have been minimal.",
