            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and peplomer spike (S) protein [1]. FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein [2], [3]. Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats. In contrast, FIPV infection causes a fatal disease called FIP. Cats that developed FIP were affected in several organs, and central nervous system, forming lesions accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation [1]. Several studies have investigated potential vaccines to prevent FIP. Virulence-attenuated live or inactivated FIPV vaccines have been experimentally used for the prevention of FIP. However, none of these have exhibited a sufficient preventive effect and actually enhanced the development of FIP [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. When anti-FCoV antibody-positive cats were inoculated with FIPV, the onset time of FIP is earlier than that in antibody-negative cats, and symptoms are severer [11]. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection.",

In contrast, IFN-\u03b3 production was not induced by inactivated-SARS-CoV in patients with a condition that progressed to a serious state or death after SARS-CoV infection. Based on the above findings, it was suggested that memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, i.e., the cellular immune response, may participate in viral clearance in recovered SARS patients. We similarly showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from FIPV-infected non-FIP cats specifically and significantly produced feline IFN-\u03b3 (fIFN-\u03b3) against heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation, while those from FIP cats did not [19], [20]. These results support the previous finding that T helper (Th)1 activity plays an important role in defense against FIPV infection. Thus, the induction of Th1 activity is essential for the development of vaccines against FIPV infection [1], [21], [22], [23], [24].",

The amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the S protein differs markedly between type I FIPV and II FIPV [2], [3]. Thus, 30 peptides of each serotype were synthesized for the experiment. No Th1 epitope-containing peptide was identified in the peptides derived from the S1 domain of type I FIPV. In contrast, 7 Th1 epitope-containing peptides were identified in the S1 domain of type II FIPV, and no linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope was contained in any of these peptides. Twenty-two peptides covering the consensus amino acid sequence (40aa\u2013260aa) between the serotypes were synthesized for the M protein based on the sequence of type I FIPV. Three peptides were synthesized for the N-terminal region (1aa\u201340aa) of the M protein for each serotype.

Peptides applicable for vaccine-inducing FIPV antigen-specific Th1 cells were then selected. When a peptide that induced significantly stronger Th1 activity than that of the FIPV antigen was searched for, 4 peptides (M-6, M-9, I-S2-15, and II-S1-24) were subsequently identified. M-9 induced Th1 activity at a level similar to that of the initial screening. Whereas M-6 only weakly induced Th1 activity in type I FIPV-infected non-FIP cats, which differed from that of the initial screening. That is, the Th1 activity of M-6 might be unstable. Thus, M-6 was excluded from the experiment.",

Th1 activity was significantly induced in response to M-9 and II-S1-24, suggesting that M-9 and II-S1-24 may be applicable to a vaccine inducing FIPV antigen-specific Th1 cells. On the other hand, Th1 activity was not induced in response to I-S2-15. The reason why only I-S2-15 out of the 3 peptides did not induce Th1 activity was unclear. It is necessary to investigate the induction of Th1 activity in cats inoculated with I-S2-15 alone using the same method. Moreover, unlike the responses of FIPV-infected non-FIP cats, no fIFN-\u03b3 production in response to heat inactivated-FIPV antigen was noted in cats administered with the peptides and fCpG-ODNs. We recently reported similar findings obtained in SPF cats immunized with peptides derived from N protein of FIPV KU-2 with fCpG-ODNs [30]. It is unclear why heat-inactivated FIPV antigen did not induce fIFN-\u03b3 production in cats immunized with peptides with fCpG-ODNs. Further investigation is necessary to identify the reason.",
