Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19 compared to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Methods: We evaluated the sensitivity using a panel of finger prick blood samples from participants >18 years of age that had been tested for COVID-19 by qRT-PCR. For assessing specificity, we used serum samples from the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort participants collected in 2012 with no exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Results: The sensitivity of the test was 77.1% (95% CI 66.6 -85.6), based upon 83 subjects who had tested positive for qRT-PCR at least 10 days before the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Based upon 100 sera samples, specificity was 98.0% (95% CI 92.9 -99.8). There was substantial agreement (Kappa score 0.76) between the qRT-PCR results and the RDT. Interpretation. The validation results are well in line with previous assessments of the test, and confirm that it is sufficiently precise for epidemiological studies aimed at monitoring levels and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

While it is highly specific, there are reports of low sensitivity in the field [3, [5] [6] [7] . The ability of the qRT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the presence of the virus in the sample and this is subject to several variables, e.g. the virus must be present in the patients nasopharinx at the time of collection and the correct use of the swab [8] . The failure to meet the necessary criteria for collection can potentially result in a false negative result. This has dire consequences for public health, especially for asymptomatic individuals as they will continue to infect others as they are not aware of the risk of transmission [7] , leading to the need of evaluating other diagnostic tools that could be useful in these settings.",

Serological tests identify antibodies in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and, although of limited clinical use in diagnosis infection [11] , are important in population-based studies that are necessary to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19.
