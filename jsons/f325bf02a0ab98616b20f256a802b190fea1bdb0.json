The amplified PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the vector PGEX-6p-1 digested with the same restriction enzymes. At the N-terminus, the construct designed for SARS-CoV-2 M pro contains the M pro cleavage-site (SAVLQ\u2193SGFRK; arrow indicates the cleavage site) corresponding to the cleavage site between Nsp4 and Nsp5 in the polyprotein of this virus.

The following conditions of steps g, h, i, j, k are mild and are unlikely to lead to racemization at P1 and P2. Furthermore, the diastereomers can be monitored by TLC during the reaction, and we just collected the main components of the mixture during flash chromatography purification, thereby also reducing the risk of impurity of the final target. Notably, we obtained two diastereomers of compounds 11 and 12, which were easily separated by flash chromatography on silica gel (TLC, compound 12, isomer 1: 0.58, isomer 2: 0.35, DCM/MeOH = 10/1, ratio 1 to 1).
