Residual feed intake (RFI) has been adopted as a reliable method for measuring, selecting for and studying FE. Pigs with low RFI (LRFI) consume less feed for a given amount of growth and backfat than pigs with greater RFI (HRFI; Gilbert et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2008). Yorkshire pigs selected for LRFI for 5 generations differed by up to 124 g/day in ADFI with no significant reduction in BW gain compared with randomly selected HRFI pigs (Boddicker et al., 2011). However, the physiology that underlies this improved FE has been poorly defined.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Gram negative bacterial outer membrane component referred also as endotoxin, is a chronic innate immune stimulator in pigs (Webel et al., 1997; Gabler et al., 2008; Weber and Kerr, 2008). Importantly, Gram negative bacteria are present in the gastrointestinal tract in large amounts and can serve as a major source of systemic endotoxin (Ravin et al., 1960; Cani and Delzenne, 2010). However, intestinal barrier integrity plays critical host defense functions against luminal immunogens such as endotoxin. Once in circulation, endotoxin activates the immune system via toll like receptors (TLR), which result in cytokine and acute phase protein production and the repartitioning of nutrients for immune function, rather than toward anabolism (Kimball et al., 2003; Rakhshandeh and de Lange, 2012). Additionally, detoxification processes can prevent the negative effects of endotoxin (Elsbach, 2000). Therefore, our objective was to examine the relationship between intestinal barrier integrity, endotoxin and inflammation with FE, using pig lines divergently selected for RFI as a model.",

Immediately after euthanasia, segments of ileum and mid colon were collected and flushed with ice cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (consisting of, in mmol/L: 25 NaHCO3, 120 NaCl, 1 MgSO4, 6.3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 0.32 NaH2PO4; pH 7.4) to remove any undigested food material. Fresh ileum and colon segments were used for ex vivo integrity measures and for mucosal scrapings. A 20 cm segment of ileum 150 cm from the ileal-cecal junction and a 10 cm segment of proximal colon 60 cm from the rectum were isolated. Ileum and colon segments were flushed with ice cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer. For mucosal scrapings, intestinal segments were then cut open longitudinally along the mesenteric border and the epithelial layer gently scrapped with a glass slide without disturbing the underlying lamina propria. Ileum and colon samples that were not used for ex vivo work were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until analysis.",

The physiological mechanisms underlying RFI or FE in swine are poorly defined. However, differences in nutrients and energy digestibility, metabolic efficiency of nutrient use, basal metabolic rate and energy expenditure are presumed to be contributing to differences in RFI, either alone or in combination (Herd and Arthur, 2009; Barea et al., 2010; Boddicker et al., 2011). Endotoxin and its associated inflammation can reduce digestibility and alter intestinal nutrient transport and post-absorptive metabolism (Albin et al., 2007; Rakhshandeh and de Lange, 2012). The net effect of increased circulating endotoxin or endotoxemia is reduced growth, increased energy expenditure and antagonizing lean tissue accretion (Orellana et al., 2007). Thus, partitioning of energy and other nutrients away from growth and toward immune system requirements may contribute to differences in FE.",

Although, characterization of intestinal microbial populations was not within the scope of this study, we cannot rule out RFI line specific differences in Enterobacteriaceae populations that may partially explain the increase in circulating endotoxin. Interestingly, the presence of greater circulating endotoxin also has the potential to affect intestinal health and function (Gardiner et al., 1995; Albin et al., 2007). As such, we reported greater ileal MPO activity and IL-8 protein expression in the HRFI pigs with augmented serum endotoxin. Both of these markers are commonly used for assessing intestinal inflammation and neutrophil infiltration (Suzuki et al., 1983). Remarkably, little has been reported with regard to pig FE and \u201cleaky\u201d or porous gut and intestinal integrity. No differences between the lines were observed in intestinal TER. This was corroborated further by no differences in the paracellular transport of 4.4 kDa FITC-Dextran or FITC-LPS. Although decreased expression of tight junction proteins claudin 3 and 4 during inflammation have been implicated in increased intestinal permeability (Pinton et al., 2010), the mRNA expressions of occludin, claudins 3 and 4 were not different between the our pig lines. These data agree with the intestinal integrity LPS challenge data reported by Albin et al. (2007). Altogether, these data indicate that in healthy pigs, intestinal integrity is tightly controlled and may not contribute significantly to differences in FE.",

In our study, serum endotoxin and the acute phase protein, haptoglobin, were found to be significantly lower in the LRFI pigs. Our values for haptoglobin, CRP and LBP are in agreement with the values reported in non-challenged pigs (Barbe et al., 2011; Diack et al., 2011). However, serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins are known to increase after stress and inflammation (Pineiro et al., 2007; Pineiro et al., 2009) and the magnitude of the response is generally related to the severity of the stress or disease (Hall et al., 1992; Murata et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2009). Even though our pigs were considered healthy, we observed an acute increase in serum haptoglobin and CRP in our HRFI gilts, compared with their LRFI, more FE counterparts. Although difficult to interpret, we speculate that an increase in acute phase proteins is a response to acute tissue damage, inflammation or stress. Studies have reported no straight forward correlations with LPS and acute phase proteins in pig serum (Van Gucht et al., 2006). However, we observed a significant and moderate correlation between serum LPS and haptoglobin, but not CRP.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the high immune response of HRFI pigs doesn't appear to be a result of increased intestinal permeability, but could be a result of differences in detoxification processes. Animals and humans harbor reduced concentrations of circulating endotoxin even in normal and healthy conditions (Erridge et al., 2007). The potential biological process that might account for the decreased endotoxin concentrations in the LRFI pigs may include the greater efficiency in endotoxin clearance, neutralization or detoxification. These processes occur in various tissues, including immune cells, liver, kidney and intestine. Furthermore, various binding proteins and enzymes such as ALP, lysozyme, and AOAH are involved (Munford et al., 2009). Alkaline phosphatase is a hydrolase enzyme present in liver, intestine and kidney tubules and it dephosphorylates bacterial LPS and reduces its toxicity (Poelstra et al., 1997; Bates et al., 2007). Greater ALP activity in both liver and ileum of LRFI pigs indicates that they deactivated or neutralized endotoxin more efficiently. It is speculated that pigs are vulnerable to enteric infections and susceptible diarrhea, and growth-check due to compromised mucosal alkaline phosphatase (Lackeyram et al., 2010). Further, intestinal ALP reduces trans-mucosal passage of bacteria and also protects against LPS-induced inflammation (Lall\u00e8s, 2010). This may be affirmed by the moderately negative correlation between ALP and serum endotoxin concentration in our study. Further evidence suggests that ALP can also mitigate BW loss after an immune challenge (Bol-Schoenmakers et al., 2010).",

Acyloxyacyl hydrolase is an important lipase enzyme that selectively removes the secondary fatty acyl chains attached to the primary chains in the lipid A moiety and detoxifies endotoxin (McDermott and Fenwick, 1992). This leads to an LPS molecule which could bind the signaling proteins MD2/TLR4, but does not have the potential to initiate the signal or can only be a partial agonist (Lu et al., 2005). The fact that we did not see evidence of differential AOAH mRNA expression in the intestine or liver was surprising. However, AOAH mRNA and activity appear to be correlated in a tissue or cell specific manner (Feulner et al., 2004). Therefore, liver and intestinal mRNA expression may not be correlated in swine or immune and Kupffer cell specific expression needs to be determined, where activity and expression of AOAH are greater.",

In our study, although lysozyme activity in the liver was not different between the 2 lines and ileum lysozyme activity was greater in LRFI pigs. This may explain the decreased serum endotoxin and haptoglobin concentrations in the LRFI pigs and greater FE. Supporting this hypothesis, recent studies found that feeding lysozyme to pigs improved their health and FE (May et al., 2012; Nyachoti et al., 2012). However, tissue lysozyme activity was not determined in these studies.

Together, this would explain the increase in acute phase proteins. Pigs repeatedly exposed to endotoxin have augmented haptoglobin concentrations compared with a single endotoxin exposure (Dritz et al., 1996; Wright et al., 2000). In addition, increased reactive oxygen species production and reduced mitochondrial coupling may also explain our data. Reactive oxygen species production increases protein carbonyl formation in low FE broiler (Bottje et al., 2006) and steer (Sandelin, 2005) tissues. Importantly, these proteins may be more susceptible to degradation and turnover which would contribute to the acute phase protein response we report herein and the reduced FE phenotype.",
