However, despite a reduction in early regimen-related toxicities and day 100 mortality with non-myeloablative regimens when compared to conventional myeloablative regimens the cumulative treatment-related mortality remains similar in the two groups.1 This has been linked to delayed onset GVHD seen following non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT, especially in recipients of transplants from unrelated donors.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Additionally, even though there is a well-recognized association between GVHD and protection from relapse,6 severe acute GVHD does not confer protection from relapse of leukemia4, 6 and is more apt to be associated with poor survival. 7, 8 Compounding the problem, those undergoing reduced intensity SCT are often elderly or have comorbidities, which puts them at significant risk for mortality in the event of developing severe GVHD. In addition, their related donor pool is limited, resulting in greater reliance on unrelated donors and increasing the risk of GVHD. Thus, severe acute and chronic GVHD remain as major barriers to the successful application of allogeneic SCT in the elderly.",

Another potential avenue of investigation is to alter the conditioning regimen to modulate the immune function of the graft. The rationale for such an approach was established in a series of murine studies, in which unmanipulated MHC disparate BMT facilitated by low-dose thymic and whole body irradiation, combined with various regimens of CD4 and CD8 monoclonal antibodies and post-graft immunosuppression, resulted in engraftment with durable mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism, but without the development of GVHD.9, 10, 11, 12 This donor\u2013recipient tolerance was largely achieved by the depletion of T cells in both the host as well as in the marrow inoculum by the monoclonal T-cell antibodies used in the preparative regimen.",

We conducted sequential clinical trials evaluating the combination of rabbit ATG with reduced intensity TBI. Because of thymic involution seen in the elderly, we excluded thymic irradiation as delivered in the murine model. Likewise fludarabine, a drug commonly used in reduced intensity conditioning regimens, was excluded because of its additional myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive effects. We report the results of patients transplanted following conditioning with ATG given in combination with low-dose TBI.",

We hypothesized that this was attributable to excessive T-cell depletion of the graft by the ATG and inadequate host immunosuppression by this regimen. To address these concerns, the conditioning regimen was modified for cohort 2. The reported estimate of the elimination half-life of active ATG (capable of binding lymphocytes) is approximately 7\u201310 days,19, 20 and therefore the ATG infusion was completed 1 week before stem cell infusion to attenuate the degree of donor T-cell depletion achieved by this regimen. TBI dose was also increased to 4.5 Gy, based on canine transplant studies, in which 4.5 Gy TBI followed by CsA resulted in allo-engraftment21, 22, 23 and 4.0 Gy TBI followed by canine-G-CSF allowed hematopoietic recovery without stem cell rescue.24, 25 MMF replaced MTX for post transplant immunosuppression because of marginally superior engraftment reported in the preclinical canine model when MMF was given with CsA instead of MTX (one out of five rejecting with CsA+MMF as compared with three out of six with CsA+MTX).26 Engraftment failure rate of \u2a7e10% and GVHD rate of \u2a7e30% were defined as early stopping criteria for maintaining patient safety in this cohort. Backup autologous stem cell collection was mandated for the first 10 patients. This phase of the study has been completed and we report the experience with this clinical trial.",

T-cell engraftment was more robust after modification of the conditioning regimen to complete the ATG administration 1 week ahead of stem cell infusion and with a higher dose of TBI. We hypothesize that this is related to a decline in active ATG levels by the time of allograft infusion and more complete immunosuppression of the recipient with the higher TBI dose, allowing reliable lymphoid engraftment with minimal acute GVHD, providing a platform for later adoptive immunotherapy with DLI.

This was most likely attributable to the high dose of ATG used in our study, with resultant significant delay in lymphoid recovery secondary to T-cell depletion contributing to both graft loss as well as relapse seen in these patients. Although delaying stem cell infusion following ATG and intensifying host immunosuppression by increasing the TBI dose in the second cohort has resulted in more robust lymphoid engraftment, the disease relapse rate remained high in this later cohort of patients. This may largely be due to the poor prognosis of the patients we treated, that is, patients with persistent or untreated high-risk MDS, AML and post-autograft recurrence of multiple myeloma, but a role for in vivo T-cell depletion in producing higher relapse rate cannot be excluded. It remains to be determined whether this strategy would be more successful in patients traditionally treated with non-myeloablative transplants, that is, heavily pretreated chemotherapy-sensitive CLL, follicular and mantel cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and first-remission multiple myeloma. Other patients may require a greater degree of pretransplant cytoreduction before undergoing ATG-based non-myeloablative conditioning.",

Even though moderate levels of residual recipient chimerism (>10%) early on appear to confer a greater risk of treatment failure in our small heterogeneous group of patients, several elderly patients with MRD SCT maintained disease remission even though they had mixed recipient\u2013donor hematopoietic chimerism (5\u201310% recipient DNA), suggesting a beneficial impact of residual host hematopoiesis. In a murine allograft model, superior DLI-mediated antitumor effect was observed in mice which were mixed chimeric as opposed to full donor chimeric, with the host MHC class I expression being critical for these antitumor responses.29 Greater effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy in the setting of mixed chimerism is also illustrated by canine studies in which DLI given to recipients of BMT from DLA-identical donors, following 10 Gy TBI and ATG, resulted in conversion to full donor chimerism without GVHD, when given around day 60, whereas earlier infusion resulted in lethal GVHD.30 Another explanation for this observation may be through invoking the immune homeostatic effects of lympho-depletion, which is recognized for its immunostimulatory effect in patients undergoing therapy for cancer and may indeed have a similar role in the setting of T-cell-depleted non-myeloablative allografts incorporating strategies to perform adoptive immunotherapy with DLI.31, 32 All these lines of reasoning suggest a potential beneficial effect of adoptive immunotherapy with DLI on the platform of early mixed chimerism achieved by T-cell-depleting regimens. Such conditioning regimens may in the future also allow an assessment of tumor-specific vaccines in the context of an allogeneic SCT.",

In our patients a rapid normalization of NK cell counts following transplantation was observed. This early NK cell recovery may be particularly useful in recipients of URD transplants, where a trend toward fewer relapses in patients with missing KIR Ligands, belonging to HLA-C1, C2 or Bw4 sero-groups, has been observed;33 indeed, our small data set seems to mirror this observation. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that patients receiving T-cell replete URD allografts are more likely to have poor KIR reconstitution when compared with recipients of T-cell depleted URD BM, with the improved KIR reconstitution correlating with improved survival.34 The authors of that study concluded that T cells in the graft affect early NK cell development in recipients of unmanipulated BM, skewing it toward a KIR-deficient CD56hi IFN-\u03b3-secreting phenotype, contributing to GVHD. We speculate that the robust engraftment without acute GVHD that we see following URD hematopoietic SCT may be attributed to ATG affecting NK cell reconstitution by altering the T-cell content of the graft. The rapid reconstitution of CD16/56dim NK cells that we observe may also be related to the positive outcomes seen in URD recipients with missing KIR ligands, as these cells are known to mediate cytotoxicity against tumor targets.35 Given the nearly universal disparity in KIR genotypes in unrelated donor\u2013recipient pairs, the use of URD with such ATG-based conditioning for transplanting high-risk elderly patients becomes an attractive option as a means of maximizing the potential for GVL effects while reducing GVHD risk.36, 37",
