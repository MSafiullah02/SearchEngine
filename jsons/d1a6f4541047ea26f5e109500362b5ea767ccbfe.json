Our abilities to address these morbidities in PLWH must be considered alongside the socially-produced burdens that both place this population at risk for COVID-19 and heighten the likelihood of adverse outcomes. These burdens can affect the physical, emotional, and social well-being of PLWH and interfere with the delivery of effective healthcare and access to HIV treatment. We posit that a syndemic framework can be used to conceptualize the potential impact of COVID-19 among PLWH to inform the development of health programming services.",

This risk in PLWH is predicated on potential interactions between COVID-19, HIV, and other risk factors for COVID-19 complications such as diabetes and hypertension that are common in PLWH, potential interference with care and treatments, and high rates of socially-produced burdens in the form of violence, stigma, discrimination, isolation, and hate experienced by PLWH [1, 2] . As such, a syndemic framework provides a meaningful and robust paradigm to understand the impact of COVID-19 disease in PLWH and to develop health programming services for PLWH in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In this perspective, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, is assumed to function in tandem with a myriad of health challenges faced by PLWH, including HIV itself, chronic non-communicable diseases, mental health burden, substance abuse, and other infections, all of which are catalyzed by biological, behavioral, psychosocial and structural drivers of disease as posited by Halkitis et al. [4, 5] . Such synergies are even greater in older PLWH, who also are at higher risk for COVID-19-related mortality [6] [7] [8] . Over the last two decades, the extant literature has provided ample evidence to support the veracity of a syndemic framework along the developmental continuum [4, 5, 9, 10] and across time [11] , which is notably a biopsychosocial perspective of health and disease [12, 13] .",

            "text": "Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has prolonged the lifespan of PLWH. In the United States, 1.2 million people are living with HIV. Of these, more than 50% are 50 + years of age, and many physical complications related to long-term ART use and aging have arisen [18] [19] [20] [21] . Older PLWH, in particular, have a higher risk of non-communicable comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease than uninfected individuals of similar age [22] [23] [24] [25] . Putative mechanisms for these comorbidities include aging itself and chronic inflammation caused by HIV and/or ART [26] . Epidemiologic evidence suggests that both older age and a number of comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease, are risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease [27] . While limited data are available on COVID-19 and HIV-coinfection as of early April 2020 [28] [29] [30] , and on the potential protective effects of HIV antivirals [1, 30] , the interaction between these comorbidities nonetheless lends itself to an understanding through a syndemic framework [31] . Expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 virus to bind and enter host cells, is substantially increased in patients with diabetes and hypertension, who are often treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers [32] . Further, there is a concern that individuals with severe immunodeficiencies, such as HIV, may be at risk for a severe course of COVID-19 disease.",

Such risk is predicated on the fact that PLWH under age 50 are both less likely to be diagnosed (and in effect more likely to be immunocompromised) and also less likely to access and be retained in care, yielding viral suppression of a mere 37% on those age 25-34 [34] .",

Physical distancing is described as avoiding crowds, canceling large events, closing schools, staying at and working from home; these measures have been shown to reduce the rate of new COVID-19 infections. However, we know very little about how physical distancing enforced by a pandemic such as COVID-19 continues to impact PLWH. Older PLWH already experience heightened rates of loneliness and social isolation [43, 44] , compromising their social and emotional well-being and health in light of social distancing efforts [45] , albeit sound epidemiological principles inform such efforts. Diminished neurocognitive functioning and heightened mental health burden evidence in older PLWH may impede effective self-care [46] . Moreover, for individuals from underserved communities and communities of color who constitute the majority of patients we see at the IDP, physical distancing may not be possible due to financial conditions or work circumstances. Economic disparities, associated with worse health conditions and underlying health conditions [47] , likely explain higher death rates due to COVID-19 noted in communities of color [48] .",

In this view, societal conditions such as discrimination, poverty, and homophobia drive the development of these internalized states that interfere with the ability for both people and populations to address their health [39] . Thus, if we are to address COVID-19 infection for vulnerable populations including PLWH effectively, these matters must be brought to bear. Such drivers may include political and human rights determinants [49] , including but not limited to state-sanctioned discrimination [4] . These factors are deemed to create the biological vulnerabilities that are noted in communities of color, particularly those populations where the experience of such stressors is heightened. In this view, it is understandable why migrants, people with criminal justice histories, the poor, and those who do not identify as White, heterosexual, or cisgender are more susceptible to disease states. Additionally, food insecurity is a factor that contributes to this syndemic [5] . Food insecurity has been associated with increased HIV transmission risk, poor clinic attendance, poor ART adherence, poor immunological and virologic responses, lower efficacy of ART, and high mortality [50] . The COVID-19 pandemic has created more heightened food insecure states for all populations, including PLWH, therefore exacerbating these burdens. ",

This framing also fully embraces the concept of pathogen-pathogen interaction, which is central to our understanding of HIV-COVID-19 co-infection [3] . To protect PLWH from COVID-19 and future pandemics, programming to address COVID-19 disease in light of the multiple mutually reinforcing health burdens faced by PLWH is imperative. While healthcare providers often attend to the biological, behavioral, and occasionally psychological drivers of health, public health focuses on the structural drivers of disease and disease surveillance, neither fully embraces the psychosocial burdens and stressors that diminish well-being as delineated in a conceptualization such as that of a syndemic [13] . Effective treatment for HIV-COVID-19 coinfection must be designed to address these viral interactions as well as the psychosocial burdens that both exacerbate co-infection and increase the likelihood of mortality.",
