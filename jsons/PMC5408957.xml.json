This ligand of chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 3 (CXCR3) found on T lymphocytes (Th1), natural killer (NK) cells and eosinophils is encoded by the CXCL10 gene on chromosome 4 at band q21, and is secreted by monocytes, endothelial cells, adipose tissue, and fibroblasts [4], [7], [8], [9], [10]. IP-10 plays a role in angiogenesis inhibition, cell chemotaxis, regulation of cell growth and proliferation, and apoptosis [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Infections associated with IP-10 include those caused by parasites, viruses, bacteria and fungi [3]. IP-10 production is associated with both protection from and facilitation of infection. Recent reports have indicated increased levels of IP-10 occur with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and suggest a biomarker role for IP-10 [16], [17], [18], [19].",

The development of a biomarker for virally-mediated ARIs could potentially lead to a methodology to point to infection etiology and severity in order to formulate a treatment plan. Based on previous studies, the hypothesis is that serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with ARI severity and durations in otherwise healthy individuals. Also, we considered that the detection of virus in nasal specimens would be associated with IP-10 concentration obtained early in the ARI course. This could potentially be helpful, as there are few if any clinically useful markers of mild to moderate severity acute respiratory infection.",

Three cohorts of 99, 105, and 104 healthy individuals who gave written informed consent over three seasons were enrolled in August and September and were followed until May. The trial is ongoing, and the investigators are still blinded. IP-10 concentrations used in this analysis were measured at study entry before randomization of intervention occurred and within the first 72 h following onset of ARI. It is still unknown if or how the meditation or exercise interventions could influence IP-10 measurements.

Blood samples were collected using standard venipuncture techniques, and the serum was frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. IP-10 concentrations were measured in picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) using ELISA, according to manufacturer's protocol (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The assay range is 7.8\u2013500 pg/ml, and samples with concentrations greater than the highest standard were diluted as directed by the manufacturer's protocol and remeasured. At the time that the participant contacted the study coordinators to report an ARI, the participant performed a nasal self-swab. A nasal lavage was done at the time of the blood draw. Multiplex PCR was used to detect and identify respiratory viruses in nasal swab and wash samples. Over 100 rhinovirus serotypes, as well as serotypes of influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and metapneumovirus can be identified. Overall sensitivity is estimated at 94%, with 99% specificity [20]. Viruses detected in either nasal swab or lavage were considered positive. Viruses were grouped by type for analysis: adenovirus and bocavirus, coronaviruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus, influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses (metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial viruses).",

The Jackson score is calculated by summing scores for eight symptoms: sneezing, headache, malaise, chilliness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat and cough. Each symptom is rated 0, 1, 2, or 3; from absent to severe [21]. Data about symptom severity and quality of life impact were collected daily using the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) until the ARI episode resolved [22], [23]. The daily severity score is calculated by adding the WURSS items for that day. To calculate area under the curve (WURSS AUC) for ARI global severity, the sum of WURSS totals across all daily time points of the illness episode was used, and trapezoidal approximation was then applied [24], [25]. WURSS can be divided into three categories of symptoms: nasal, throat, and quality of life (QoL) symptoms [25], [26].",

Fisher's z transformation was used to compute 95% confident intervals (CI) around the correlations. Wilcoxon scores were computed and used in the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test to compare continuous variables by groupings (e.g. ARI global severity between participants with corresponding IP-10 measurements versus those without IP-10 measurements at time of ARI). Generalized linear regression modeling techniques were used to assess the relationship between ARI outcomes and IP-10 after adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex, and body mass index (BMI)); repeated measures modeling was used to account for the correlation between observations within a participant for those who had more than one ARI. Generalized linear regression modeling techniques with repeated measures correlations were also used to compute LSMeans comparisons between the viral infection categories using the Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons. ARI global severity, ARI duration, and IP-10 are highly skewed measurements; we transformed these measurements on the log base10 scale before running the regression models. Observed measurements for these data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). For the change from baseline models with log base 10 transformed outcome variables, change was calculated as log10(ARI at later time point/ARI at baseline). The beta can be interpreted as a percentage change in the outcome (e.g. ARI global severity) for every unit increase in the predictor variable (e.g. IP-10). All statistical analyses were run using SAS 9.3.",

Thus, we were able to collect serum samples for IP-10 concentration during 225 ARI episodes that occurred in 157 individuals (Table 1\n). Characteristics of these 225 ARI episodes with corresponding IP-10 collection can be also be found in Table 1. There were no statistically significant differences in ARI global severity or ARI duration between the ARI episodes where IP-10 was collected as compared to the ARI episodes where IP-10 was not collected.

Our group previously found a positive correlation between interleukin-8 concentrations in nasal wash and severity and duration of ARI nasal symptoms, including runny nose, plugged nose, and sneezing [25]. In contrast, serum procalcitonin is not a useful marker for ARI [28]. Other research groups have reported that nasal IP-10 is correlated with ARI, primarily among people with underlying illness [29], [30], [31]. ARIs caused by parainfluenza virus in adults with severe multiple disabilities had an almost 9 fold increase in the serum concentration of IP-10 during the acute phase of the infection [16]. Additionally, in other populations with underlying illnesses, such as asthma or COPD, IP-10 concentrations measured in serum [16], [32], [33], [34] or nasal [31] samples or IP-10 gene expression [19], [35] again correlated with acute respiratory infections leading to exacerbations. Although IP-10 concentrations are higher in smokers with COPD but not in smokers generally [36], the number of smokers in our cohort is small and hence unlikely to influence IP-10 concentrations. However, we also analyzed change in IP-10 with ARI and got the same results. Although the correlations are relatively modest, our study results show that serum IP-10 is a potentially useful marker for ARI severity and trends with ARI duration in this healthy population.",

These were community-recruited female-predominated participants who are primarily white, well-educated and agreed to be monitored for a cold-and-flu season. The vast majority of illness episodes were not severe enough to prompt clinical evaluation. A sample collected from people presenting to clinic would likely demonstrate somewhat higher severity and biomarker values, which might influence the relationships reported here [38], [39]. The nasal specimens in which no virus was detected are certainly not always without viral or infectious cause. There are several reasons why we did not identify virus in someone sick with what appears to be an ARI: (1) we did not test for the virus causing the infection; (2) the symptoms are associated with an allergic response or other inflammatory reaction; (3) the infection is of bacterial [40] or fungal etiology; (4) the symptoms are caused by chemical irritation; (5) the symptoms are psychosomatic.",
