The synthetic quinolone class of antimicrobials exploits these reactions by targeting DNA\u2013topoisomerase complexes (Sugino et al. 1977; Gellert et al. 1977; Drlica et al. 2008). Quinolones a derivative of nalidixic acid was introduced in the 1960s to treat urinary tract infections, which was a by-product of the synthesis of chloroquine (a quinine; Hooper and Rubnstein 2003). Nalidixic acid and other first-generation quinolones (e.g., oxolinic acid) are hardly used today owing to their toxicity, whereas second (ciprofloxacin)-, third (levofloxacin)-, and fourth (gemifloxacin)-generation quinolone antibiotics (Table 12.1) are widely marketed. These can be classified on the basis of their chemical structure and of qualitative differences between the killing mechanisms they execute (Rubinstein 2001; Hooper and Rubnstein 2003).\n",

The prevention of the activation of the SOS response has also been displayed to decrease the development of drug-resistant mutants by hindering the generation of error-prone DNA polymerases (Criz et al. 2005), horizontal transfer of drug-resistant elements (Guerin et al. 2009), and homologous recombination. Owing to these studies, illuminating the co-treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol and quinolones inhibits the ability of quinolones (Beaber et al. 2004)",

            "text": "The bacterial cell is sheathed by strata of peptidoglycan (also known as murein), a covalently cross-linked polymer matrix that is composed of peptide-linked \u03b2-(1\u20134)-N-acetyl hexosamine. The mechanical strength afforded by this layer of the cell wall is crucial to a bacterium\u2019s ability to endure environmental conditions that can alter prevalent osmotic pressures; of note, the degree of peptidoglycan cross-linking compares with the structural integrity of the cell. Maintenance of the peptidoglycan layer is accomplished by the activity of transglycosylases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs; also known as transpeptidases), which add disaccharide pentapeptides to encompass the glycan strands of existing peptidoglycan molecules and cross-link adjacent peptide strands of immature peptidoglycan units, respectively (Bugg and Walsh 1992). The treatment with an inhibitor of cell wall syntheses changes induction of cell stress responses, cell shape and size, and ultimately cell lysis. For instance, \u03b2-lactams (including penicillins, carbapenems, and cephalosporins) wedge the cross-linking of peptidoglycan units by obstructing the peptide bond formation reaction that is catalyzed by peptidoglycan-binding proteins (PBPs) (Wise and Park 1965; Holtje 1998; Park and Uehara 2008). This inhibition is achieved by penicilloylation of the PBP active site \u2013 the \u03b2-lactam (containing a cyclic amide ring) is an analogue of the terminal d-alanyl-d-alanine dipeptide of peptidoglycan. Penicilloylation of the PBP active site blocks the hydrolysis of the bond created with the now ring-opened drug, thereby disabling the enzyme (Waxman et al. 1980; Josephine et al. 2004) through autolysis using autolysins. Autolysins are membrane-associated enzymes that break down bonds of peptidoglycan strands. Autolysins have also been displayed to show a part in lytic cell death in bacterial species that contain numerous peptidoglycan hydrolases, such as E. coli (Tipper and Strominger 1965). In E. coli, a set of putative peptidoglycan hydrolases (lytM domain factors) were shown to be important for rapid ampicillin-mediated lysis (Uehara et al. 2009). The discovery that autolysins contributed to cell death expanded our understanding of lysis and showed that active degradation of the peptidoglycan with inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic triggers lysis.",

For instance, in Staphylococcus aureus, the lytSR two-component system affects cell lysis by modifying autolysin activity (Burnskill and Bayles 1996). lytR triggers the manifestation of lrgAB, which was found to impede autolysin activity and thereby lead to antibiotic tolerance. lrgA is similar to bacteriophage holin proteins (Groicher et al. 2000), which control the access of autolysins to the peptidoglycan layer. Based on this evidence, a supplementary holin-like system, cidAB, was uncovered in S. aureus and initiated to activate autolysins, representing S. aureus more susceptible to \u03b2-lactam-mediated killing. Complementation of cidA into a cidA-null strain inverted the damage of autolysin activity but did not wholly reinstate sensitivity to \u03b2-lactams (Rice et al. 2003).",

            "text": "The mRNA translation process occurs over three sequential phases (initiation, elongation, and termination) that comprise the ribosome and a range of cytoplasmic accessory factors (Garrett 2000). The ribosome is composed of two ribonucleoprotein subunits, the 50S and 30S, which assemble (during the initiation phase) following the formation of a complex between an mRNA transcript, N-formylmethionine-charged aminoacyl tRNA, several initiation factors, and a free 30S subunit. Drugs that inhibit protein synthesis are among the biggest classes of antibiotics and can be divided into two subclasses: the 50S inhibitors and 30S inhibitors (Table 12.2). 50S ribosome inhibitors include lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin), macrolides (e.g., erythromycin), streptogramins (e.g., dalfopristin\u2013 quinupristin), amphenicols (e.g., chloramphenicol), and oxazolidinones (e.g., linezolid) (Nissen et al. 2000; Katz and Ashley 2005). The 50S ribosome inhibitors work by physically blocking the access of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome or either initiation of protein translation (as is the case for oxazolidinones) (Patel et al. 2001). Among ribosome inhibitors, the only class that is broadly bactericidal is naturally derived aminoglycosides. Macrolides, streptogramins, spectinomycin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and macrolides are typically bacteriostatic; however, they can be bactericidal in a species- or treatment-specific manner.\n",

The uniquely small size helps NPs to interact with cells due to a larger surface area-to-mass ratio with handy and manageable application, in contrast to traditional antibiotics. Besides the interruption of bacterial membranes, difficulty of biofilm formation is another significant mechanism, as they portray a major measure in the progress of bacterial resistance (Peulen and Wilkinson 2011). The distinctive structure and arrangement of bacterial biofilms deliver protection to the implanted microorganisms, assisting them to escape from most antibiotics. Moreover, bacterial biofilms are \u201ca breeding ground\u201d for regular resistance mutations and the interchange and variation of these mutations among diverse bacterial cells (Khameneh et al. 2016). Studies have revealed that many NPs can prevent or overcome biofilm formation, including Au-based NPs (Yu et al. 2016), NPs, 7 CuO NPs (Miao et al. 2016), Ag-based NPs (Markowska et al. 2013), ZnO Fe3O4 NPs, Mg-based NPs (Lellouche et al. 2012b), NO NPs (Hetrick et al. 2009; Slomberg et al. 2013), and YF NPs (Lellouche et al. 2012a).

Doping modification is also one of the most operational methods to normalize and regulate the interaction of NPs with bacteria. Lately, the ZnO NPs with Au (gold) combination to form ZnO/Au nanocomposites were administered to improve photocatalytic activity and to enhance ROS generation. These effects are the result of the following factors: an altered ZnO bandwidth, better light absorption owing to the surface plasmon resonance wavelength of Au, enhancement of the photo-induced charge carrier reactivity, and amplified electron transport efficiency and carrier charge separation (He et al. 2014). For instance, ZnO NPs doped with fluorine generate more ROS than ZnO NPs, resulting in greater damage to bacterial cells (Guo et al. 2015; Podsporka et al. 2017). The ZnO NPs have \u201cO\u201d content at the surface regulating antimicrobial effectiveness against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Mehmood et al. 2015). Nano-TiO2 reduces the formation of biofilms in dental implants, showing greater antimicrobial action. In comparison with unmodified TiO2, nano-TiO2 increases photocatalytic activity, as the doped form can effectively extend the active spectrum to the visible light region by the valence bandwidth elevation and the forbidden bandwidth deprivation (Peng et al. 2010; Sangari et al. 2015).",

For example, the temperature of the environment potentially influences the antibacterial activity following its effect on the ROS generation rate. When ZnO NPs are encouraged by temperature, electrons are detained at the active sites. Afterward, the electrons interact with oxygen molecules (O2) for ROS generation, thereby increasing the antimicrobial effectiveness of ZnO NPs. A decrease in the pH increases the rate of dissolute ZnO NPs, which elevated the antimicrobial properties (Saliani et al. 2015). In addition, under acidic conditions, the injury of ability of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-poly(l-histidine) (PLH)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-encapsulated vancomycin deceased selectively. Certain results proposed that protonation of the imidazole groups of PLH selectively under acidic conditions intensely influenced NP surface charge switching. The surfaces of the NPs were charged positively at low pH that becomes beneficial to the interaction with the negatively charged groups of the bacterial cell barrier, prompting multivalent strong electrostatic regulation (Radovic et al. 2012). Another study proposed that the interaction of Ag+ with dissolved oxygen and protons caused an oxidative dissolution mechanism for AgNPs which could activate AgNPs and release many Ag ions, enhancing the antibacterial activity of the AgNPs in acetic acid than in neutral water (Peretyazhko et al. 2014).The culture medium characteristics, such as osmotic pressure and pH, can influence the aggregation, surface charge, and solubility of NPs. Antibacterial tests in five types of media demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of ZnO NPs is mainly due to free Zn ions and zinc complexes. Furthermore, the medium can supply nutrients to bacteria to improve their tolerance to NPs (Li et al. 2011). Finally, a study has shown that preparation of ZnO NPs under different stirring conditions can affect their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria and a fungus (C. albicans; Khan et al. 2016).",

AgNPs incline to accumulate at the bacterial membrane forming aggregates when they are put in connection with bacteria and cause perforations leading to cellular death (Li et al. 2010). However, different sizes (from 1 nm to several hundreds of nm) also interact for the action mechanisms between biological components and AgNP surfaces as the particle size can propose their action mechanism slightly without a secondary species. The AgNPs generate cytotoxic action by inactivating enzymes of bacteria by producing reactive oxygen species (Kim and Ryu 2013). Some other mechanisms give a prevalent role to Ag+ species. Some systems containing initially silver (+1) species release ROS by simple dissolution or ion exchange such as salts (Valentine et al. 1998), zeolites (Sambhy et al. 2006), or ionomers (Dallas et al. 2011), which doesn\u2019t happen with metallic Ag0 nanoparticles. Thus the monovalent silver species becomes antibacterial agent keeping NPs as a reservoir. The silver ions possess affinity toward organic most notably thiols with which they form a quasi-covalent bond (Ag\u2013S binding energy being around 65 kcal/mol), amines and phosphates. Affinity of Ag+ for selenol groups is analogous (Han et al. 2001), but these moieties are fairly uncommon in the living world. Furthermore, silver can act as a linking agent between several thiols forming aggregation of the thiol-containing molecules which are irreversible (Parikh et al. 1999). Several molecules (DNA, peptides (membrane-bound or inside the cell), or cofactors) have been recognized as the target of these ions that was observed with the dying bacteria. With contrast to the antibiotics which targets one particular constituent of the bacterial life cycle, Ag+ ions will adsorb voluntarily to any high affinity moiety; thus unlikely many pathways are affected causing the cellular death. A much more probable hypothesis would be that silver binds non-specifically to a wide variety of targets, perturbing simultaneously many aspects of the cell metabolism and leading to its death. Among all pathways affected, some are very sensitive to little amount of silver species too. This capability to disrupt a large variety of pathways may be one reason explaining the antibacterial action of silver nanoparticles against a very broad spectrum of microorganisms. Park et al. presented that developed ROS were intricated in more than half of the antibacterial activity by comparing Ag+ action in the presence and absence of oxygenic respiration. The release of chemisorbed ions at the surface of the particles along with oxidation was another source of Ag+ ions in nanoparticulate systems (Dobias and Berrier 2013). A percentage of the novel silver salt will remain oxidized comparatively even if a mild reducing agent (such as sodium citrate) is added to the solution by remaining free in solution or bound to the surface of the Ag0 nanoparticles by a group of pending citrate ligands (Henglein 1998).",

However, in presence of excess chloride, soluble silver (+1) polychloride species AgClx (x \u2212 1)\u2212 are formed and contribute to the antibacterial activity (Chambers et al. 2013; Levard et al. 2013). The size and shape dependency of the nanoparticle also contributes to the release of Ag+ ions required to dissolve AgNPs (Pal et al. 2007); Zhang et al. 2011). The improved activity occurs due to a larger surface per unit of mass scales like 1/R (the number of particles scales like 1/R3 and the surface like R2, with R the radius). These minor NPs reveal more active surface and are thus more prone to dissolution. For analogous reasons, accumulated NPs uncover a smaller amount of surface to the solvent than separated NPs and possess a lesser antibacterial impact (Bae et al. 2010). However, it has been recently validated by Liu et al. that the released Ag+ scale well if the samples were regularized by their exposed surface. Afterward, Xiu et al. showed in 2012 that the substantial parameters to evaluate the activity of silver nanoparticles were the silver released as Ag+ and not the quantity of primary silver added as nanoparticle (Fig. 12.1) to the solution.\n",

Under dark-field light-scattering microscopy, Au NPs can sense endocytosis, tumor metabolites, and receptors in cells (Dykman and Khlebstov 2011). Some Au NP-based diagnostic kits are under clinical trials (Kumar et al. 2015). Green-synthesized Au NPs (Fig. 12.3) have also been used in the development of quantification of blood glucose, biosensors, toxic metals, disease markers, and insecticides (Liu and Lu 2003).

Apart from their other applications, due to its ability for the electrostatic flux across membranes, resulting in distorted membranes, the antimicrobial activity of Au NPs has been typically oppressed (Li et al. 2010). Moreover, nanoparticles also improve many gene expressions serving in redox processes leading to microbial death (Nagy et al. 2011) through smaller size, distinctive surface chemistry, photothermic nature, and polyvalences (Gu et al. 2003; Gopinath et al. 2013). The reaction of Au Nps with sulfur- or phosphorus-holding bases leads to inactivation of enzymes (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenases), which interrupt the respiratory chains by high amount of free radical generation causing cell death. Another proposed hypothesis is that these NPs decline the ATPase activities and GNP may also prevent the tRNA binding to ribosomal subunit (Cui et al. 2012). For instance, during leishmaniasis, Au NPs produces an elevated electron numbers by yielding ROS (O \u2212 2 and \u2022OH). These ROS may even abolish DNA and other cellular components of the pathogen. Another possible mechanism is that these Au NPs obstruct the H+ efflux in the transmembrane.",

Moreover, according to Ahmad et al. 2013, a 7 nm Au NPs could confine the H+ transmembrane efflux of the Candida species further than the 15 nm Au NPs. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity also differs according to the cell wall composition. This was well evidenced by the Au NPs\u2019 highest activity against Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria due to the composition difference as described in earlier section. Other than the cell wall structure of bacteria, surface modification (coating or capping agents), concentration, and purification methods also affect the antibacterial activity (Zhang et al. 2015; Kaviya et al. 2011). The antibacterial activity efficacy of Au NPs can be enhanced by antibiotic coatings especially aminoglycoside antibiotics (Payne et al. 2016). It is very interesting that comparing green-synthesized Au NPs to chemically synthesized Au NPs shows effectual antibacterial activity against certain bacterial strains, which may be due to the synergistic effect of Au NPs and extracts (Mishra et al. 2011).",

They are used powerfully to fight microorganisms (Sawai et al. 1995). There are some reports (Sawai et al. 1995) considered which reveals by a conductometric method a considerable antibacterial activity of CaO, MgO, and ZnO, which were attributed by the generation of reactive oxygen species on the surface of these oxides. Once ZnO destroys the cell membrane, the ZnONps remain forcefully adsorbed on the dead bacteria surface preventing further antibacterial action continuing to release peroxides into the medium showing high bactericidal efficacy. From the results of another study (Stoimenov et al. 2002), it was being observed that the smaller particle size enhances the activity due to its large surface area-to-volume ratio. The thorough mechanism of ZnONP activity is still under study.",

Three key aspects can be extrapolated from the studies conducted so far on the antiviral properties of NPs: (1) NPs have validated antiviral activity against many viruses affecting both prokaryotic (De-Gusseme et al. 2010; Narasimha 2012) and eukaryotic organisms, making them a true broad-spectrum antiviral agent; (2) viral inhibition even relies on the size of NPs (Speshock et al. 2010); and (3) early infection might be the general time frame where NPs exert their antiviral activity imposing the rest of the viral replication cycle (Baram-Pinto et al. 2009; Trefry and Wooley 2013). However, an exact mechanism of NP antiviral activity and a particular phase of infection at which NPs exert antiviral activity have yet to be revealed.",

Accordingly Kumar and his coworkers in 2016 analyzed the synergistic effects of AgNPs with eight antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria (Fig. 12.5 and Table 12.4). In many cases, they could analyze that the effects of antibiotics were enhanced. Synergistic interaction of AgNPs and streptomycin showed a minute increase in the inhibition zone against seven pathogenic bacteria in the range 0.1 to 0.9 with the exception of B. cereus where a 6.1-fold increase was seen. When combined with kanamycin, amikacin, tetracycline, and cefetaxime, the AgNPs showed comparable synergy (a 0.1\u20134.4-fold increase). Amoxicillin depicted the highest overall synergistic activity as for S. marcescens, while vancomycin with AgNPs revealed synergistic activity against E. coli. A greater fold increase in case of inhibition zone was initiated against S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, and E. coli in the existence of a blend of cefepime and AgNPs. S. epidermidis, S. marcescens, E. coli, S. typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, S. marcescens, and B. subtilis were found to be subdued in combination of AgNPs and antibiotics, which otherwise indicated a resistant pattern in the manifestation of the antibiotics (vancomycin, cefetaxime, ampicillin, kanamycin, amikacin, cefepime) alone. Thus it could be augmented that AgNPs enhance its efficacy in company of most of the antibiotics, against many drug-resistant bacteria (Fayaz et al. 2010; Ghosh et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2013).\n\n",
