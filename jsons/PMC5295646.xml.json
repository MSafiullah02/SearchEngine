            "text": "As universal biological information storage entities, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are unique biorecognition molecules, and the detection of pathogen genomic DNA or RNA provides one of the most reliable methods for viral infectious disease diagnostics. Emerging and remerging infectious pathogens, such as Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), West Nile, dengue and Zika viruses create a strong need for a low-cost, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platform that would enable rapid and sensitive pathogen detection (Woolhouse et al., 2015, Zumla et al., 2015, Daep et al., 2014, Petersen et al., 2016). Early and accurate detection of viral infectious diseases is of crucial importance in preventing epidemic disease outbreaks as well as in improving the efficacy of POC diagnostic technologies (Peeling and McNerney, 2014, Sin et al., 2014). In use since the early 1990s, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) amplification has been a gold standard in viral diagnostics (Yang and Rothman, 2004, Espy et al., 2006). While qPCR offers high specificity with low limits of detection, it and other similar existing diagnostic methods have their drawbacks, such as the use of expensive devices for repeated thermal cycling, specialized non-reusable reagents, the need for sensitive fluorescence detection optics, and laborious assay preparation steps requiring trained personnel (Timmer and Villalobos, 1993). For example, a typical qPCR will require highly trained technicians 4\u20138 h from sample preparation to completion using reagents such as specific TaqMan probes and matching master mixes with reverse transcriptase enzymes and DNA polymerase, costing up to hundreds of dollars per assay depending on sample number and origin. Consequently, such analytical methods do not align with the need for a rapid, inexpensive, highly specific and sensitive point-of-care platform (Craw and Balachandran, 2012, Peeling and McNerney, 2014, Sin et al., 2014).",

            "text": "One of the cost-effective alternatives to PCR-based detection of pathogen genomic DNA relies on measurement of electrical property changes (resistance, capacitance, and complex impedance) due to DNA-DNA hybridization at probe-target binding sites without labeling. Such a sensing modality has been used successfully to detect specific DNA molecules in complex mixtures in a number of different assays, making it attractive for reliable classification of target DNA (Boyd, 2013, Ventimiglia and Petralia, 2013; Drummond et al., 2003; Byron et al., 2016, Marzancola et al., 2016). Electrode configuration and geometry can have a significant effect on sensor performance (Pettine et al., 2012). One of the widely used electrode configurations, especially for sensors measuring capacitance changes due to DNA-DNA hybridization (capacitive biosensors), is the interdigitated microelectrode. Microelectrodes are often made using modern photolithographic and deposition techniques on glass, silicon, or other solid substrates (Blanda, 1991, Gawad et al., 2009, Pettine et al., 2012). When they are tightly integrated with the back-end measurement circuits, they have significant advantages over conventional carbon-based electrodes (Li and Miao, 2012) for analytical measurements, such as low resistance, high signal-to-noise ratio, rapid attainment of steady state, and the use of small solution volumes (Dandy et al., 2007, Yang and Bashir, 2008, Wydallis et al., 2015).",

The biosensor presented in this paper operates in the non-faradaic mode based on changes in capacitance between interdigitated electrodes to indicate molecular binding events at the electrode surface. Biosensors operating in the faradaic mode are often based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Daniels and Pourmand, 2007; Lisdat and Sch\u00e4fer, 2008) by measuring electron transfer resistance and double layer capacitance within a frequency range. Comparing to capacitive biosensors, biosensors based on EIS have been widely explored for their ability to capture complex resistance changes due to binding events at biosensor's electrode sites. However, they are more complex from an electronics and experimental protocol perspective, requiring a wide-range frequency sweep and the use of a potentially hazardous redox couple (e.g. Fe(CN)6\n3\u2212/4\u2212) for measuring faradaic current. With the simplicity of measuring capacitance change between electrodes due to DNA-DNA hybridization between targets and probes, combined with low limit of detection (LOD) and high specificity, the results from this paper show that label-free capacitive biosensors have the potential as a baseline technology for low-cost, low-power, easy to use rapid detection POC platform (Bracke et al., 2007).",

A number of studies (Berggren et al., 1999, Qureshi et al., 2010) reported poor sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. Non-uniformity of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and the covalently attached DNA probes on the sensor surface is a major contributing factor to poor sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. Sensor surface cleanliness greatly affects the uniformity of SAM layers (Love et al., 2005). Covalently attached ssDNA probes are largely affected by the presence of common contaminants in commercial thiolated DNA probes (Lee et al., 2010). The lack of emphasis on electrode cleaning prior to assay functionalization may have also contributed to significant variations of the reported results. Stagni et al. (2006) elucidated the importance of electrode surface cleaning in order to achieve uniform covalent binding of thiolated DNA probes. In addition, the total surface area of microelectrodes and the geometric relationship between two electrodes in a biosensor are other factors which directly affect sensor sensitivity and reproducibility, as measured capacitance output represents averaged values from all the fingers of the microelectrodes (Guiducci et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Here, a label-free, affinity-based capacitive IDE sensor is developed for unamplified nucleic acid detection, with high sensitivity and reproducibility. The proposed platform technology uses capacitance changes resulting from the solid-phase hybridization of nucleic acid targets with ssDNA probes immobilized on microelectrodes as the means of detection and identification. A 24-nucleotide DNA probe and target set was designed based on the West Nile virus sequence (Kunjin strain) and was applied as a model for nucleic acid based viral recognition and detection on the proposed capacitive biosensor (Steel et al., 2000, Oliveira et al., 2015). The process of DNA probe preparation for the biosensor has been optimized to include steps to minimize the effect of contaminants associated with commercial thiolated DNA probes. It is demonstrated here that this new biosensor produces an output of more than 70 nF in capacitance change in response to as few as 20 complementary DNA targets (0.25 attogram) at a concentration of ~1.5 aM. Due to the optimized cleaning process for the capacitive biosensor, including a pre-cleaning protocol, to improve covalent immobilization of purified single-stranded DNA probe oligomers onto the microelectrodes, the biosensor's reproducibility was improved compared to the reported results. In addition to the low detection limit, the biosensor showed a good dynamic range of detection from 1 \u00b5L\u22121 to 105\n \u00b5L\u22121 target molecules (20 to 2 million total targets), making it suitable for sample analysis in a typical clinical application environment. The capacitance results obtained in this study were verified using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides on a fluorescence scanner. Capacitive affinity-based assays have long been considered highly sensitive (Mattiasson and Hedstrom, 2016), but low specificity and reproducibility (Berggren et al., 1999) hinder further improvement in their sensitivity. The results presented in this paper provide a potential path for practical use of capacitive sensing technology for viral pathogen detection in clinical settings.",

The MCU is used to block any remaining unoccupied sites on the sensor surface and to align the probes perpendicular to the sensor surface in order to improve hybridization efficiency (Herne and Tarlov, 1997).4.Electrodes after incubation and hybridization with ssDNA targets, both complementary and non-complementary.\n",

Two widely used salt buffers, each at two different ionic concentrations, 1 M and 100 mM 1\u00d7TE-NaCl, and 1 mM and 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO4, were tested to quantify their effect on the degree of hybridization between the probe and complementary and non-complementary targets. Intercalation of the planar SYBR Green fluorophore into dsDNA increases its fluorescence emission dramatically, allowing detection of dsDNA by monitoring fluorescence intensity. SYBR Green fluorescence intensity in RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) in the presence of 24-base synthetic probe and complementary/non-complementary targets with increasing temperature is shown in\nFig. 2A, illustrating double stranded DNA (dsDNA) formation due to DNA probe-target interactions in different buffer conditions and within 4\u201395 \u00b0C temperature range. As temperature increases, dsDNA concentrations decrease resulting in decrease in SYBR green fluorescence intensity. To understand the effect of buffer composition on hybridization specificity, fluorescence intensity differences between complementary and non-complementary targets in each buffer type within the temperature range from 4 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 2B. Non-complementary target RFU background seen in the melt curve assay, especially at the lower temperature range (Fig. 2A), can be attributed to two factors. First, lower temperatures favor non-complementary binding and specificity of duplex formation is increased with an increase in reaction temperature. Second, the conditions with very high target and probe oligo concentrations enhance the formation of primer dimers which contributed to higher SYBR Green signal at the beginning of the assay in the non-complementary target samples.",

The specificity from using the 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO4 buffer decreased with temperature up to 23 \u00b0C, but it is still better than that for all other three salt buffers up to 45 \u00b0C. For each salt type the specificity increased with decreasing ionic concentration, and this behavior is consistent with other results reported in the literature (Petrovykh et al., 2003). At the temperature used for all subsequent hybridization studies (23 \u00b0C) the 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO4 buffer demonstrates the best hybridization specificity. While low ionic concentrations are beneficial, in general, for achieving high specificity, a potential downside is that a low concentration of monovalent cations may hinder ssDNA probe immobilization on the IDE sensor surface (Petrovykh et al., 2003). The negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone, coupled with low cation concentration, may result in unacceptable electrostatic repulsion effects. However, the cation valence has a larger effect on probe immobilization than its concentration, so that bivalent cations, such as Mg2+, can mitigate the repulsion effect, and therefore result in a higher density of immobilized probes on the IDE sensor surface (Petrovykh et al., 2003). Furthermore, low ionic concentration serves to reduce measurement interference from the leakage current that often occur due to sodium deposits on the sensor surface. Overall, the 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO4 buffer was found to be the best compromise of composition and concentration to achieve high hybridization specificity without compromising ssDNA probe immobilization, and it was used as the electrolyte buffer for all remaining experiments.",

Since the double layer capacitance at the electrode-electrolyte interface is established due to the displacement of mobile ions in the fluid, it is expected that increasing the stimulus signal frequency will result in gradual disappearance of the double layer capacitance (Guiducci et al., 2004). To gain a better understanding of the sensor's response characteristics as a function of the stimulus signal frequency, a 20 mV RMS AC voltage is applied at three separate frequencies (20 Hz, 100 Hz and 1 kHz). Capacitance values for all four stages were measured for all three frequencies. The results shown in\nFig. 3A verify changes in capacitance due to probe immobilization compared to the bare clean electrodes (marked as \u201ccontrol\u201d in Fig. 3A).

In general, the cleaner the IDE surface the better thiol-modified molecules will attach to the gold surface (Xue et al., 2014). The IDE sensor surface was cleaned with the protocol described in Section 2.5 and treated with oxygen plasma to promote ssDNA immobilization. In addition to surface cleanliness, ssDNA immobilization is also determined by time the thiol modified ssDNA is in contact with the gold surface. In general, twenty-four hour incubations are required to reach the saturation point for 1 \u00b5M ssDNA immobilization in 1 M salt conditions, and further exposure results in little additional adsorption (Herne and Tarlov, 1997). For ssDNA probe concentrations ranging from \u00b5M to mM, a surface density in the order of 103\n cm\u22122 can be obtained after four hours of incubation (Guiducci et al., 2004). In order to maximize sensor functionalization and the number of probes present on the functionalized sensor based on our previous work (Dandy et al., 2007), overnight incubation was chosen for the 10 \u00b5M 5\u2032 thiol-modified ssDNA probe in our experiments. Probe concentration was set in the \u00b5M range based on previous work on the gold electrode DNA biosensors (Dandy et al., 2007) and was further optimized with additional chemical and plasma oxygen cleaning steps to maximize sensor coverage and target capture in 100 \u00b5M 1\u00d7TE-MgSO4 buffer. To validate 5\u2032 thiol-modified ssDNA immobilization on the IDE sensor surface, capacitance measurements were obtained from 3 individual sensors after overnight ssDNA probe incubation, but before passivation with MCU.\nFig. 4A demonstrates a statistically significant difference (p<0.01) between the average capacitance measurements before and after probe immobilization, indicating that ssDNA probe was immobilized on the IDE surface. To further validate the capacitance results, AlexF488N labeled ssDNA probes were immobilized on IDEs as a complementary assay to monitor probe deposition. Total IDE fluorescence intensities were obtained before and after probe immobilization (Fig. 4(B)), showing that incubation with fluorescent ssDNA probe resulted in a significant increase in fluorescence on the IDE (p<0.01) similar to what was observed by capacitance measurements.",

Based on the 24-base DNA target used in the experiments, target incubation was set for 30 min at room temperature (23 \u00b0C).

The average capacitance of sensors incubated with complementary and non-complementary target DNAs with the standard error of three individual sensors are shown in\nFig. 5A. Non-complementary target DNAs did not induce a significant capacitance change, whereas complementary DNA induced a large capacitance change in the sensor. This is further validated using fluorescent target capture on the sensor surface (Fig. 5B). Decreased capacitance on IDE surfaces upon target binding has been previously reported in the literature. When ssDNA probes are immobilized on the IDE surfaces, the double layer of ions due to the polarized metal surface are displaced (Berggren et al., 1999). When complementary DNA strands bind with the probes, the distance between the charge on the surface of the electrode and the ions in the electrolyte increases, resulting in decreasing in the overall capacitance (Berggren et al., 1999, Guiducci et al., 2004).",

            "text": "To determine the sensitivity of the sensor, DNA concentrations between 0 and 2 million molecules, consistent with the range seen in typical clinical settings, were incubated on the sensor and capacitance was determined (\nFig. 6). Complementary target DNAs displayed a significant capacitance change as few as 20 DNA molecules, whereas non-complementary DNAs did not significantly change capacitance even at 2\u00d7106 molecules. For target concentrations between 20 and 2 million DNA molecules, complimentary targets showed a linear response in capacitance change with increasing target concentration, indicating an excellent correlation between low-range target concentrations and capacitance responses. These results demonstrate that the label-free capacitive detection limit for the complementary targets is at least as low as 20 DNA molecules (~1.5 aM). Increasing complementary target concentrations increased capacitance changes, whereas increasing non-complementary DNA concentrations did not significantly increase capacitance. There have been a number of ultra-high sensitive biosensors reported to date which achieved limits of detection similar to the results presented in this paper. Most of these ultra-high sensitive approaches relied on novel amplification methods using nano-materials, such as nano-particles (Li et al., 2010) and quantum dots (Shen and Gao, 2015). Other approaches using nano-structures include the use of a novel molecular gate structure with carbon-nanotubes to control sensor's conduction state (Nuzaihan et al., 2016), the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a highly conductive agent to enhance redox current sensitivity (Nie et al., 2012), and the use of CNTs combined with Au nano-particles to increase sensor surface area (Wang et al., 2013). However, these approaches incur additional costs related to additional sample preparation for nano-materials and amplification, and nano-scale device manufacturing. The biosensor presented in this paper achieved a high sensitivity comparable to those achieved using nano-materials for amplification and other enhancements, thus lowering the cost and simplifying sample processing and device manufacturing requirements.",

            "text": "In this paper, a capacitive biosensor with high sensitivity and a wide dynamic detection range is presented. The carefully designed protocol for sensor surface preparation, probe immobilization, and hybridization strikes a balance among the competing factors of ease of immobilization, specificity, and the overall capacitance measurement quality. The reported biosensor improves the state of the art on three fronts. First, the sensor was able to produce an output of more than 70 nF in capacitance change in response to as few as 20 complementary DNA targets (0.25 attogram) at a concentration of ~1.5 aM. The magnitude of capacitance change increases linearly with complementary target concentration in the range between 20 and 2 million target DNA molecules. The detection limit of this biosensor is among the lowest reported to date for a non-faradaic capacitive biosensor. Second, sensor specificity is clearly demonstrated by the capacitance change differential between complementary and non-complementary target binding. For non-complementary ssDNA target molecules, the measured change in capacitance is significantly less than that for the complementary ssDNA target and does not display an appreciable change in capacitance with non-complementary molecule concentration increases. Third, the sensor achieved a dynamic range for detection between 1 \u00b5L\u22121 and 106\n \u00b5L\u22121 target molecules (20 to 2 million target DNA molecules) with excellent linearity in the measurement of capacitance changes. Combining its performance in sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic detection range, this capacitive biosensor demonstrates the potential to be a viable technology for low-cost, low-power, ease of use, and rapid detection technology that is a critical step toward POC pathogen detection. Areas where further investigations can provide more optimized conditions for the capacitive biosensor include optimized incubation time to decrease time for sample analysis. Furthermore, future development of this capacitive biosensor includes detection of viral nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from complex biological samples, as well as platform multiplexing, with the ultimate goal of developing a POC device for rapid and multiplexed diagnosis of viral infections in clinical and field settings.",
