The presence of enterotoxigenic (ETBF) and nonenterotoxigenic B. fragilis in stool samples from calves with or without acute diarrhea and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains were evaluated. The stool samples were plated onto a selective B. fragilis-bile-esculin agar, and incubated anaerobically (10% CO 2 /90% N 2 ), at 37 1C, for 72 h. Species of the B. fragilis group were identified by using the API 32-A kit. Enterotoxigenic strains were detected by PCR and the cytotoxic assay. From 54 diarrhea and 54 nondiarrhea stools, 124 and 92 members of the B. fragilis group, respectively, were recovered. Only two ETBF strains were isolated from two different diarrhea samples and the bft gene was detected in both. Moreover, the bft gene was detected in DNA from four different diarrheal stools samples but no ETBF strain was recovered. All the bacteria were susceptible to chloramphenicol, imipenem, moxifloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole and tigecycline. Most of the isolates from both calves with and without diarrhea were resistant to all metals. Our results are of concern, and suggest the need to increase the surveillance of antibiotic and metal resistance of this microbial group isolated from animal production such as calves.",

Bacteroides fragilis is considered an important clinical pathogen and it is the most common anaerobe isolated from human clinical specimens producing endogenous infections (Duerden, 1994) . Moreover, B. fragilis is also considered to be the most virulent species in the genus Bacteroides due to its virulence factors and its predominance in monomicrobial and mixed infections such as brain, lung, intra-abdominal and intrapelvic abscess, peritonitis and sepsis (Duerden, 1980) . Some strains of B. fragilis (ETBF) produce an enterotoxin that causes diarrhea in animals and it has also been associated with diarrhea in humans (Border et al., 1985; Wu et al., 2002) . This extracellular toxin has been character-ized as a heat-labile zinc-metalloprotease of approximately 20 kDa and is a member of the matrix metalloprotease subfamily of the metzincin superfamily (Moncrief et al., 1995; Wu et al., 2006) .",

One possibility is that ETBF strains were present at nondetectable levels in those stool samples, as the supernatant from these four samples did not produce alterations on HT-29/C 1 cells. Our results suggest that other enteropathogens, such as, rotavirus, coronavirus, Salmonella spp., enteropathogenic E. coli, ETEC or Vibrio cholerae could be implicated in the diarrhea processes (Myers et al., 1985) . These enteropathogens were not evaluated in this study. Antimicrobial resistance in anaerobic microorganisms is increasing, particularly in those considered as resident microbiota. The use of antibiotics in bovine cattle is avoided because they are a food source for humans. In this study, all the tested bacteria were susceptible to chloramphenicol, imipenem, moxifloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole and tigecycline, in accordance with Snydman et al. (1996) , Aldridge et al. (2001 ), Nakano & Avila-Campos (2004 and Rossi & Andreazzi (2006) . However, most of the bacteria showed high levels of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested, and these results may indicate that animals received drugs with food or from soil contaminated with, for example, metal ions. Brazilian studies have reported the antimicrobial susceptibility of species of the B. fragilis group isolated from both human and Callithrix penicillata marmoset gastrointestinal tracts showing an increase of resistance to several drugs (Avila-Campos et al., 1991; Carvalho et al., 1997; Pestana et al., 1999) . The high frequency of isolation and the predominance of B. fragilis in calves could also be attributed to variable breeding conditions, such as possible outside runs, nonauthorized use of antimicrobial growth promoters, limited use of antimicrobials for therapy and age at slaughter.",
