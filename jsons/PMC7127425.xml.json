Prophylactic medication has been successfully used to control avian coccidiosis, but alternative strategies are sought due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant coccidia in commercial production settings [2], [3]. Although there is a growing reliance on the use of Eimeria parasite vaccines for coccidiosis control [4], [5], live vaccines pose the risk of unintended infection under the immunosuppressive conditions associated with high-density commercial rearing conditions. On the other hand, while subunit protein and DNA vaccines do not present the possibility of field infections, both are of limited immunogenicity and there is a lack of suitable immunoenhancing adjuvants for the poultry industry [6], [7], [8], [9].",

Profilins are essential components of all Apicomplexan parasites, and are involved in actin-dependent gliding motility, parasite migration across biological barriers, and host cell invasion [10]. The profilin gene encodes a \u223c20 kDa protein that is highly conserved among the various genera of Apicomplexans and expressed during most stages of the parasite's life cycle [6], [11], [12]. Toxofilin, the profilin of Toxoplasma gondii, binds to TLR11, inducing a potent IL-12 response in murine dendritic cells, and plays a critical role in CD4+ T cell-driven immunity to the pathogen [10], [13]. In our previous study, profilin was identified from the merozoites of Eimeria acervulina as an immunogenic protein that induced high levels of IFN-\u03b3 production by splenic T cells [14]. Subcutaneous immunization of young broiler chickens with recombinant profilin protein in the absence of adjuvant, or in ovo vaccination of 18-day-old embryos with a DNA plasmid encoding the profilin gene, provided limited, but statistically significant protection against challenge infection with live E. acervulina\n[6], [8].",

            "text": "Recently, substantial progress has been made in the formulation of novel adjuvants that enhance the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins without unwanted side effects [15], [16], [17]. For example, saponins such as Quil A are derived from the South American tree Quillaja saponaria molina and are currently used in several veterinary applications [18]. Quil A is combined with cholesterol and phospholipids to form immunostimulatory complexes (ISCOMs) that avoid the hemolytic and viricidal properties of Quil A alone [19]. However, ISCOMs may stimulate an undesirable autoimmune reaction, and some hydrophilic proteins cannot be efficiently incorporated into their structure. Alternatively, dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA) and avidine are lipophilic quaternary amine adjuvants that stimulate robust cell-mediated and humoral immune responses [20]. The efficacy of DDA as an adjuvant for proteins, haptens, viruses, protozoa, and bacteria has been reported [21], [22], [23]. By itself, DDA is sparingly soluble in water and is more effective when used with polymers such as dextran, polyethelyne glycol, or polyacrylic acids like Carbopol. QCDC is a new adjuvant complex composed of Quil A, cholesterol, DDA, and Carbopol that enhances immune responses against multiple pathogen vaccines in a variety of veterinary settings [24]. However, the adjuvanticity of QCDC in poultry has not been reported. Therefore, the current study was undertaken to evaluate the adjuvant effect of QCDC during vaccination against avian coccidiosis.",

Body weights were measured between 0 and 9 days post-infection. For the determination of fecal oocyst shedding, birds (12/group) were placed in oocyst collection cages and fecal samples were collected between 6 and 9 days post-infection. Oocyst numbers were determined using a McMaster chamber according to the following formula: total oocysts/bird = [oocyst count \u00d7 dilution factor \u00d7 (fecal sample volume/counting chamber volume)]/2 [27], [28].",

For example, DNA immunization with plasmids encoding either the profilin or EtMIC2 Eimeria protein has been shown to induce both antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses, and to confer partial protection against live parasite challenge infection [6], [8]. However, the levels of protective immunity against avian coccidiosis that are induced by subunit protein vaccines have been limited, due in large part to the complex parasite life cycle that includes intracellular and extracellular as well as sexual and asexual stages [1], [14], [23]. Each of these stages is associated with a unique pattern of gene expression by the parasite and not all Eimeria proteins are expressed in all stages. In addition, individual chickens can be simultaneously or sequentially colonized by multiple Eimeria species, and cross-protection of host immunity among the different parasites is severely limited. As a result of these practical limitations, recent interest has developed in using vaccine adjuvants as immunostimulators to enhance the immunogenicity of coccidia subunit vaccines.",

Quil A by itself has been used as an adjuvant in many veterinary animal species, and defined saponins such as QS-21 are currently used in human clinical trials [36], [37], [38], [39]. DDA provides a significant adjuvant effect when co-administered systemically or locally with antigen and stimulates predominantly Th1 cells with no reported toxic effects in humans [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46]. In avians, DDA enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to a Newcastle disease virus vaccine and induced greater lymphocyte proliferation compared with complete Freund's adjuvant [22]. Chickens immunized with Eimeria merozoite antigens in combination with DDA displayed longer-lasting coccidial immunity compared with the Corynebacterium parvum adjuvant [23]. Carbopol is a mucoadhesive polymer that has been extensively investigated due to its high viscosity at low concentrations and low toxicity [47]. Carbopol enhanced the efficacy of recombinant canarypox viral vectors for equine herpes virus vaccination and significantly improved virus neutralizing antibody responses to this virus [48]. No prior studies have examined the effects of Carbopol on poultry vaccines.",

In this regard, the importance of cell-mediated immunity in conferring protection against avian coccidiosis has been well documented [26], [34], [49], [50], [51], and humoral immunity also appears to be of some assistance [25], [28]. Serum antibody levels showed higher titers against profilin in the group immunized with profilin plus QCDC, whereas no significant differences in anti-EtMIC2 antibody levels were seen among these groups (Fig. 2B). The reason why profilin plus QCDC had no effect on parasite fecundity/shedding compared with profilin alone is unclear, but this observation is in agreement with previously published reports indicating the absence of a direct correlation between Eimeria-induced body weight loss and fecal oocyst shedding [29], [49].",

In fact, increasing levels of gene transcripts encoding IL-10 and IL-17F were associated with enhanced protection against coccidiosis [55], although their role in local immune response needs to be investigated. IL-1\u03b2, a proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells, exerted an adjuvant effect when given with a profilin DNA vaccine and reduced fecal oocyst shedding following oral infection with viable parasites [7]. IL-17 is a cytokine that is secreted exclusively by activated memory T cells which induce fibroblasts to secrete other proinflammatory or hematopoietic cytokines [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61]. IL-17 was highly up-regulated following primary infection with E. acervulina or E. maxima, but not E. tenella\n[52], [60]. Chicken IL-17 induced IL-6 production and both cytokines together may play an immunoregulatory role in the initiation, maintenance, and control of intestinal inflammatory responses [61]. IFN-\u03b3 has also been associated with protective immune responses to coccidiosis [26], [62], [63]. Administration of recombinant chicken IFN-\u03b3 significantly increased host protection against coccidiosis and reduced the intracellular development of Eimeria in chickens [64]. In contrast, IL-10 acts as a differentiation factor for a novel subset of T cells that function as suppressors [65]. IL-10 inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6), thus down-regulating inflammatory T cell responses [66], [67]. Following E. acervulina infection, IL-10 expression was moderately increased [52]. Finally, IL-15, a cytokine that promotes the survival of T and NK cells [53], [68], enhanced protective immunity to coccidiosis challenge when co-administered with the profilin vaccine [7].",
