The unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and spread all over Europe and the world has forced French hospitals to reorganize and admit a large number of critically ill patients in a short period of time. Data from China reported up to 6% of patients overall (1) and 71% with severe COVID-19 (2) requiring mechanical ventilation. Median length of hospital stay was 12 days (1), but patients with severe disease may remain in intensive care units (ICUs) for 2 to 3 weeks, and survival time for non-survivors has been reported to be 1 to 2 weeks (2).",

New cases and especially severe ones are increasing exponentially following a similar evolution in Italy (5) , with a risk of ICU saturation in many French regions. There is a growing need for ventilator weaning units that could help ICUs discharge ventilator-dependent patients with stable disease and no other organ failure but respiratory or neurological features. According to other physical medicine and rehabilitation societies worldwide, early evaluation and rehabilitation for these patients is mandatory (6, 7) .",

We could not implement a full monitoring system in the nurses' office, but ventilator alarms are repeated by using \"babyphones\" or with an independent remote alarm system.

Day shifts are organized so that 2 senior physicians and 1 resident are present each day. Night shifts include 3 additional senior physicians to ensure secured rotations. Paramedic staff consists of 3 rotations of 3 nurses and 3 caregivers per 24 hr. Nurses were recruited from ex-ICU nurses or individuals with experience in post-ICU care. They all underwent a full-day teaching program with the medical staff and a ventilation-specialized nurse before the opening of the unit. Finally, 2 physiotherapists are dedicated to motor and cardiorespiratory rehabilitation of patients. This rehabilitation staff is also assisted by part-time occupational and speech therapists to help with communication and early oral feeding of tracheotomized patients as well as 2 part-time psychologists.Before opening the unit, we carefully defined criteria for patients to be admitted safely in this unit. Ventilator-dependent patients have to be tracheotomized at least 24 hr before admittance but can be dependent 24/7 if the last prone decubitus session was \u2265 72 hr and have PaO2/FiO2 ratio (FiO2 \u2264 45%) > 200 for at least 2 days. They have to be weaned from vasopressors for 48 hr and have no other organ failure needing invasive support. Finally, before ICU discharge, patients are switched from an ICU ventilator to the weaning unit ventilator with clinical assessment and arterial blood gas analysis after 2 hr.Hence, between March 26 and April 9, 10 patients (8 men, mean [SD] age 62 [14.9] years) were admitted in the unit: 2 were discharged to a conventional medical unit then home, transferred back to the ICU because of secondary pulmonary critical exacerbation.",
