To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the associative capacity of the host-virus networks in rodents and bats with the identification of those viruses with zoonotic potential. A virus database, detected by molecular methods, was constructed in the two taxonomic groups. We compiled 5,484 records: 825 in rodents and 4,659 in bats.",

Based on a network theory, a non-directed bipartite host-virus network was built for each group. Subsequently, the networks were collapsed to represent the connections among hosts and viruses. We identified both discrete and connected communities. We observed a greater degree of connectivity in bat viruses and more discrete communities in rodents. The Coronaviridae recorded in bats have the highest values of degree, betweenness and closeness centralities. In rodents, higher degree positions were distributed homogeneously between viruses and hosts. At least in our database, a higher proportion of rodent viruses were zoonotic. Rodents should thus not be underestimated as important reservoirs of zoonotic disease. We found that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than in rodents. Network theory can reveal some macroecological patterns and identify risks that were previously unrecognized. For example, we found that parvovirus in megabats and Gbagroube virus in rodents may represent a zoonotic risk due to the proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses. We propose that epidemiological surveillance programmes should consider the connectivity of network actors as a measure of the risks of dispersion and transmission.",

In terms of disease ecology, we can employ these and other parameters to explore the host-host, virus-host and virus-virus interactions by collapsing the networks and identifying communities. Network analysis thus offers the opportunity to recognize highly diverse viruses and hosts based on a high degree of connectedness. Bats and rodents are excellent taxa in which to implement this tool because they harbour a large number of highly adaptable viruses and hosts with high resistance. Therefore, in this study we aimed to compare and recognize the differences in the associative capacity of the host-virus networks in rodents and bats worldwide, as well as to identify the viruses that may shift across species, including humans, suggesting zoonotic potential. does not exist in the ICTV classification, we assigned all reports from Astroviridae family as astrovirus.

In addition, they can act as virus mixers, allowing the viruses to acquire characteristics that allow them to infect other host species, including humans. In addition, the human node is more closely connected to bats. It shows that viruses are shared to a greater degree among bats as discussed earlier (Figures 3a and 5a) .

However, their importance disappeared when the network was collapsed to virus-virus interactions, likely because their geographical restriction may limit their viral connectivity. Andes virus is only distributed in South America (Martinez et al., 2005) , cowpox in Europe (Vorou, Papavassiliou, & Pierroutsakos, 2008) and rabies lyssavirus in America (Moratelli & Calisher, 2015) . Therefore, these viruses In the rodent community selected, community 3 has members with predominantly European distribution. Further, two non-zoonotic viruses are included among the nine zoonotic viruses, but we do not think they are likely to have zoonotic potential because they do not have direct contact with the human node. Therefore, in this community we do not find viruses with zoonotic potential.",

This host species thus is likely less important in public health terms, but highly relevant for disease ecology. In addition, two zoonotic viruses are included in the community 5, and while they can transfer their zoonotic potential to other non-zoonotic viruses using M. musculus as a virus mixer, we consider this unlikely because the proportion of zoonotic viruses is low, adding the specificity of rodents' viruses and the associative characteristics founding in the rodents. Thus, the one-to-one virushost species relationship suggested by the node-to-edge ratio suggests that spillover is unlikely, though not impossible.",

First, humans' enormous population and globalization push human populations to nearly everywhere on earth and greatly increases the probability of contact with innumerable organisms, resulting in the emergence of zoonotic diseases (Kock, 2014) . Secondly, because zoonotic diseases have clear social implications, once detected in one species, they are much more likely to be tested for, and thus detected, in others (Oliver-Morales & Abarca Garc\u00eda, 2016). It is therefore possible that the high apparent importance of humans in the networks is more due to the over-representation of zoonotic viruses in the literature than to humans actually being particularly highly.",

In the present study, we only assessed their network proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses, and molecular genetic approaches may help to confirm our results. Counting the number of zoonotic symbionts associated with each order is not a conclusive estimate of their zoonotic potential. Our findings reveal that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than rodents. For that reason, bats have more zoonotic potential that the rodents.
