This is because our world is finite, and the randomness, indispensable for neutral evolution, is important when we consider the history of a finite world. The random nature of DNA propagation is discussed using branching process, coalescent process, Markov process, and diffusion process. Expected evolutionary patterns under neutrality are then discussed on fixation probability, rate of evolution, and amount of DNA variation kept in population. We then discuss various features of neutral evolution starting from evolutionary rates, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, junk DNA, and pseudogenes.",

If a mutation occurring in some gene modifies gene function, there is a possibility of heterogeneity in terms of number of offsprings. This is the start of natural selection that will be discussed in Chap. 6 . If genome sequences of six cells in Fig. 5 .1 are heterogeneous, cell E might have some DNA sequences that have a higher ability of offspring cell production than those of cells D and F. However, some mutations may not change gene function. Although mutants and parental (wild) types are somewhat different in terms of DNA sequences, they are equal in terms of offspring propagation. This is the egalitarian characteristics of the selectively neutral mutants. If all members of evolutionary units, such as DNA molecules, cells, individuals, or populations, are identical in terms of their potential for producing their copies (offsprings), the frequency change of these types is dominated by random events. Randomness is the fundamental factor for neutral evolution.",

This view is applicable if the population size, or the number of individuals in one population, is effectively infinite. However, the earth is finite, and the number of individuals is always finite.

In multicellular organisms, by definition, one individual is composed of many cells, and a single cell is no longer a unit of evolution. However, if we consider only germ-line cells and ignore somatic cells, we can still discuss cell lineages as the mainstream of multicellular organisms as in the case of single-cell organisms. Alternatively, clonal cells of one single-cell organism can be considered to be one individual.

From an individual point of view, the largest Mendelian population is the species this individual belongs to.

Therefore, there are many clonal lineages in one \"population,\" and each clonal lineage may also be called \"population.\" Gene exchanges also occur in asexually reproducing organisms, including bacteria.

Because every organism is the product of eons of evolution, we are unable to grasp full characteristics of living beings without understanding the evolutionary history of genes and organisms.

            "text": "It should be emphasized that the genealogical relationship of genes is independent from the mutation process when mutations are selectively neutral. A gene genealogy is the direct product of DNA replication and always exists, while mutations may or may not happen within a certain time period in some specific DNA region. Therefore, even if many nucleotide sequences happened to be identical, there must be genealogical relationship for those sequences. However, it is impossible to reconstruct the genealogical relationship without mutational events. In this respect, search of mutational events from genes and their products is also important for reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Advancement of molecular biotechnology made it possible to routinely produce gene genealogies from many nucleotide sequences. Figure 5 .2 shows a schematic gene genealogy for ten genes. There are two types of genes that have small difference in their nucleotide sequences, depicted by open and filled circles. Both types are located in the same location in one particular chromosome of this organism. This location is called \"locus\" (plural form is \"loci\"), after a Latin word meaning place, and one type of nucleotide sequence is called \"allele,\" using a Greek word akko meaning \"different.\" Open circle allele, called allele A, is ancestral type, and filled circle allele, called allele M, emerged by a mutation shown as a star mark. The numbers of gene copies are 8 and 2 for alleles A and M, respectively. We thus define allele frequencies of these two alleles as 0.8 (=8/10) and 0.2 (=2/10), respectively. Allele frequency is sometimes called gene frequency. It should be noted that these frequencies are exact values if there are only ten genes in the population in question. If these ten genes were sampled from that population with many more genes, two values are sample allele frequency.",

There are, however, many genes which did not contribute to the ten genes at the present time. If we consider these once existed genes, the population history may look like Fig. 5 .3. In this figure, the gene genealogy starting from the filled circle gene at generation 1 is embedded with other genes which coexisted at each generation but became extinct in later generations. If we consider the whole population, it is clear that allele frequency changes continuously, and many genes shown in open circles did not contribute to the current generation. How can this allele frequency change occur? Natural selection does influence this change (see Chap. 6), but the more fundamental process is the random genetic drift. This occurs because a finite number of genes are more or less randomly sampled from the parental generation to produce the offspring generation. This simple stochastic process is the source of random fluctuation of allele frequencies through generations.",

Watson, who used generating function, and they published a joint paper in 1875 [10] . Because of this history, the mathematical model considered by them is sometimes called \"Galton-Watson process,\" but is usually called \"branching process\" (see [11] for a detailed description of this process). It may be noted that surnames have been studied in human genetics (e.g., [12] ) and in anthropology (e.g., [13] ), for their transmissions often coincide with Y chromosome transmissions. It should be noted that Bienaym\u00e9 ([14] , cited in [11] ) described this process mathematically much earlier than Watson and Galton [10] in French. Fisher [15] applied this process to obtain the probability of mutants to be ultimately fixed or become extinct.

The population size is assumed to be infinite in the usual branching process, and this causes the mutant gene copy with m = 1 to become extinct. However, we live in finite environment, and the branching process under infinite population size is not appropriate when we consider the long-term evolution. When m > 1, the mutant is advantageous, and the probability of survival becomes positive, as we will see in Chap. 6. Readers interested in application of the branching process to fates of mutant genes should refer to Crow and Kimura [17] .",

However, as we saw, most of the gene lineages become extinct, and it is not easy to track the lineage which will eventually propagate in the population. Now let us consider a genealogy only for sampled genes. It is natural to look for their ancestral genes, finally going back to the single common ancestral gene. This is viewing a gene genealogy as a backward process. When two gene lineages are joined at their common ancestor, this event is called \"coalescence\" after Kingman [20] . It should be noted that Hudson [21] and Tajima [22] independently proposed essentially the same concept in 1983. Let us consider Fig. 5 .2 again. Left-most two gene copies coalesce first, followed by the coalescence of two mutant genes shown in filled circles. At this moment, there are eight lineages left, and one of them experienced mutation, shown with a star. After six more coalescent events, at around 2N generations ago, there are only two lineages. Then, it took another *2N generations to reach the final ninth coalescence. If there is no population structure in this organism, called \"panmictic\" situation, and if there is no change in population size (N), the time to reach the last common ancestral gene, or coalescent time, is expected to be approximately 4N generations ago, according to the coalescent theory of an autosomal locus for diploid organisms.",

            "text": "The simplest coalescent process is pure neutral evolution. Even if mutations accumulate, they do not affect survival of their offspring lineages. Because of this nature, gene genealogy and mutation accumulation can be considered separately. If natural selection, either negative (purifying) or positive, comes in for some mutant lineages, this independence between generation of gene genealogy and mutation accumulation no longer holds. Another important assumption for the simplest coalescent process is the constant population size, N. In diploid organism, the number of gene copies for an autosomal locus is 2N, while the number of gene copies for haploid organism locus is N. The former situation is assumed explicitly or implicitly in many literatures. However, the original lifestyle of organisms is haploid, and many organisms today are haploids. Therefore, we consider the situation in haploid organisms first. It should be noted that an approximate constant population size is more or less expected if we consider a long-term evolution. Otherwise, the species will become extinct or will have exponential growth. Though we, Homo sapiens, in fact experience population explosion, this is a rather rare situation among many species. In short-term evolution, population size is expected to fluctuate for any organism. Therefore, assumption of the constant population size is not realistic and is only for mathematical simplicity. We have to be careful about this sort of very simplistic assumptions inherent in many evolutionary theories. There are some more simplifications in the original coalescent theory: discrete generation and random mating. Random mating means that any gene copy is equal in terms of gene transmission to the next generation, and there is no subpopulation structure within the population of N individuals in question. These assumptions were also used for the Wright-Fisher model.",

If we consider a randomly mating population with constant size N, each gene copy at the present population was sampled from N gene copies of the previous generation with replacement. Therefore, if we choose one particular gene copy, say, copy ID 1, from the present population, the probability of its transmission from a specific gene copy of the previous generation is 1/N. Then, the probability of gene copy ID 2 from the present population not sharing the same parental copy with copy ID 1 is 1 \u2212 [1/N]. We then go to the next situation in which gene copy ID 3 from the present population shares the parental gene copy with neither ID 1 nor ID 2. Its probability becomes 1 \u2212 [2/N].

Unlike the treatment of allele frequency changes to be discussed in later sections, the coalescent generation time is given in terms of the total number of genes in a population in the coalescent theory. Because of this, we can check the implicit assumption of the constant population size. For example, the total number of human population as of 2018 A.D. is over 7 billion. If we apply the coalescent theory under the constant population model, the expected number of generations for coalescence of an autosomal gene, 4N, is 27 billion generations. If one generation is 20 years, the expected coalescent time becomes 540 billion years! This value is far greater than the start of this universe, i.e., Big Bang, approximately 14 billion years ago. This seemingly paradoxical situation simply comes from the population explosion, which violates the assumption of constant population size. To overcome this problem, the \"effective population size\" is often used. Modern human is estimated to have ca. 10,000 as the effective population size (e.g., [24] ). There are two books on the coalescent theory [25, 26] . We will discuss various applications of the coalescent theory in Chap. 18.",

We can relax this assumption in Eq. 5.36. Figure 5 .12 shows a schematic gene genealogy for a single lineage during time T. The vertical axis represents the whole population, and the population size N can vary. Star symbols are mutations accumulated in this single lineage, and thin dotted lines represent increase of allele frequency for each mutant. The total number of mutations accumulated during time T is lT. Fixation of each mutant is not necessary. Therefore, the evolutionary rate, k, of gene substitutions per generation should be lT/T = l, as shown in Eq. 5.36. This argument applies to any time irrespective of population size change. Even if speciation occurs, it does not affect this argument based on the single gene lineage. This is why we can consider the long-term evolution.

Now, new mutations appear by substituting one-nucleotide site, which was not changed before.

Because the majority of the vertebrate genome is noncoding, mutations occurring in this region are selectively neutral unless they occur in evolutionarily conserved regions. If mutations occur in DNA regions where important genetic information such as protein amino acids and RNA sequences is coded, or in highly conserved noncoding regions, these mutations may become deleterious, and the mutant individual may have less possibility of transmitting that gene to the offsprings. In contrast, although in rare occasions, some DNA changes will cause that mutant individual to have more offsprings than those without mutant genes. This type of mutants is called \"advantageous.\" In any case, when mutations occur, selectively neutral mutants are dominating. If we consider a long-term evolution, only a small fraction of these mutations will survive. Because deleterious mutations will soon disappear from the population (see Chap. 6), only neutral and advantageous mutants will survive in the population for a long time.",

This is a clear difference from the prediction made by researchers who advocated the dominant power of natural selection in the 1960s and 1970s. As we will see, the fixation of selectively neutral mutations via stochastic effects is the main power of evolution, and the natural selection to choose advantageous mutations has only a limited contribution, although natural selection to eliminate deleterious mutations is quite effective to keep the current genetic entity. In short, natural selection is mostly conservative, and the chance effects, including the fixation of selectively neutral mutations, are really responsible for creative nature of evolution.",

As we will see in Chap. 6, the evolutionary rate of nonsynonymous substitutions may become larger than the mutation rate when a special type of natural selection is operating, when any amino acid change is advantageous. In this case, the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions will be higher than that of synonymous substitutions. Figure 5 .17 shows a schematic comparison of the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. It should be noted that the rate of synonymous substitutions may not be identical with the mutation rate, for biases of codon usages exist [45] and some unknown factors also exist [46] . We will discuss the consequences of these sorts of purifying selection on synonymous substitutions in Chap. 6.",

In fact, only 1.5% of the human genome is used for protein coding [48] , and the rest are mostly junk. They are interspersed repeats (LINES and SINES), microsatellites, other intergenic regions, and introns (see Chap. 12). A small fraction of noncoding genomic regions are highly conserved (e.g., [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] ), and they are expected to have some functions such as enhancers. Even some SINE is known to obtain an important function during the mammalian evolution (e.g., [54, 55] ). It is still true, however, that the majority of noncoding genomic regions are functionless, and just junk DNAs. There are reports of transcriptions on many noncoding regions (e.g., [56] ). However, these results were obtained by problematic ChIP-chip techniques [57] and found to be artifact by checking ChIP-seq techniques [58] . Graur et al. [59] also condemned the ENCODE project statement [60] as an \"evolution-free gospel.\"",

We then have T 1 = (A 1 + B 1 )/2 and T 2 = (A 2 + B 2 )/2. Expected frequencies for genotypes 11, 12, and 22 become T 1 2 , 2T 1 T 2 , and T 2 2 , respectively under the simple assumption of random mating in this total population assuming the Hardy-Weinberg ratio. However, real genotype frequencies are (A 1 2 + B 1 2 )/2, (2A 1 A 2 + 2B 1 B 2 )/2, and (A 2 2 + B 2 2 )/2 for genotypes 11, 12, and 22, respectively. Let us compare the expected frequency (E f ) and real frequency (R f ) of heterozygote 12. Noting A 2 = 1 \u2212 A 1 and B 2 = 1 \u2212 B 1 ,",

Therefore, if one total population contains two differentiated subpopulations, the proportion of heterozygotes decreases from the situation of panmictic random mating of the whole population. This is called the Wahlund principle or the Wahlund effect. A more general case of many subpopulations is given by Crow and Kimura [17] using variance of allele frequencies. The extreme situation of population differentiation may be selfing or clonal subpopulations of plants. Each clonal population may be homozygous for different alleles, and there will be no heterozygotes.",

Wright [70] considered this random effect for K random mating subpopulations in the total population with a finite population size. Expanding this idea, Wright [71] proposed three kinds of fixation indices: F IS , F IT , and F ST , where I, S, and T stand for individual, subpopulation, and total population. These were originally defined as correlations of genes [71] . Nei [72, 73] showed that these three fixation indices can be obtained from the means and covariances of allele frequencies by extending the Wahlund's principle. Nei [74] generalized F ST by considering gene diversity and the mean of minimum genetic distances of Nei [75] and called it G ST . Weir and Cockerham [76] also studied F ST by extending Cockerham [77] . It should be noted that F ST , which is now widely used as a measure of differentiation between two populations, was originally considered an average of population differentiation into many subpopulations. Therefore, it is rather a misnomer to call the measure of the genetic distance between two populations as F ST.",
