            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common recessively inherited lethal disease among Caucasian population, affecting approximately one in 2500 newborns. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, and to date around 1000 different mutations have been identified. The underlying gene mutation leads to defective production of the CFTR protein, a cAMP-regulated chloride (Cl\u2212) channel located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Although the organs affected in CF also include the pancreas, gut, liver and reproductive tract, the clinical picture is dominated by pulmonary disease, with recurrent cycles of infection leading to inflammation, bronchiectasis and, in greater than 90% of patients, death from respiratory failure. The isolation of the gene responsible for CF in 1989 suggested the feasibility of new therapeutic treatments based on CFTR gene transfer to patients with CF. The rationale for the development of gene therapy protocols relies on the fact that heterozygotes appear to be phenotypically normal, expression of CFTR is low and the dysfunctional epithelial lining cells in the most affected organ, the lung, are accessible through non-invasive techniques. Furthermore, although conventional treatments have increased life expectancy of CF patients to approximately 30 years, there is clearly an urgent need for a novel therapeutic approach.",

            "text": "Preclinical studies carried out soon after the isolation of the gene showed that both viral and non-viral gene transfer agents (GTAs) were able to correct the chloride ion transport defect in CF transgenic mice. The success of these studies led several groups to initiate clinical trials of gene transfer in CF patients and three classes of GTAs have been used so far: adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and cationic lipids. Although the lung remains the most medically relevant target, many investigators chose to start their clinical studies by looking at gene transfer to the nasal mucosa. Nasal airway epithelia have a similar histology and the same CF-associated abnormalities in ion transport as pulmonary epithelia, but compared to lung, the nasal cavity has an easier access for both gene transfer and safety measurements and represents a reduced risk to the patient in case of the occurrence of side effects.",

The results reported are not always consistent and of the 30 noses assessed following a single application, approximately one-third showed some changes in chloride transport. No functional measurements were assessed in the lung studies, although some evidence of vector-derived CFTR mRNA was found. Common findings in all the studies published include (i) a dose-dependent mild local inflammation and (ii) the progressive lack of expression following repeated administration.",

Different lipoplexes were used including DC-Chol\u2013DOPE [12], [14], [17], DOTAP [15], GL-67 [13], [16], [19] and EDMPC\u2013cholesterol [18], with DNA doses ranging from 10 \u03bcg to 1.25 mg when administered to the nose and up to 42.2 mg when nebulised to the lungs [16]. Results were similar to those reported with adenoviral vectors and a correction towards normal values of the chloride defect was observed both in the nose (about 20%) [12], [14], [15], [16] and in the lung (25%) [16], lasting between 7 days and 3 weeks [16]. Interestingly, in one study naked DNA was reported to be as efficient as lipoplexes [13]. Unlike viruses, it has been reported that lipoplexes can be successfully re-administered without apparent loss of efficacy [17]. However, mild flu-like symptoms were noted in both lung trials following aerosolisation of liposome\u2013DNA complexes and are probably related to the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterially derived plasmid DNA [16], [19].",

However, in none of the clinical trials cited, has sodium hyperabsorption been altered. Each of the three GTAs used has achieved limited success, with none outshining the others. Interestingly, despite non-viral vectors being arguably less efficient than viruses in animal models and laboratory studies, clinical trials have shown that this might be different in CF subjects. More importantly, it is now generally accepted that the efficiency of in vivo gene transfer with currently available vectors needs to be increased. We will here review the progress made in improving GTAs and the hurdles to efficient transgene expression, which any vector has to overcome before entering the airway epithelial cells.",

Airway epithelia have evolved a complex series of barriers to prevent penetration of lumenally delivered materials (including both viral and non-viral GTAs) into the cell or interstitial compartment. These barriers consist of: (i) a well-defined mucus layer that may bind inhaled vectors and remove them via mucus clearance mechanisms, (ii) a glycocalyx that may bind vectors and prevent binding to cell surface receptors and perhaps most importantly, and (iii) an apical cell membrane that is relatively devoid of viral receptors and growth/tropic receptors (Fig. 1\n). This series of barriers is complemented by epithelial tight junctions that are \u2018moderately leaky\u2019 to ions but quite \u2018tight\u2019 for larger solutes, thereby preventing penetration by current vectors from the lumenal surfaces into the interstitium. In addition, CF lungs are characterised by the presence of a discontinuous barrier of purulent secretions, which contain exogenous actin, DNA and inflammatory products that can modify the integrity of a lipoplex and limit gene delivery to the airways. CF sputum has been shown to retard the movement of particles having a size comparable with lipoplexes and to almost completely block 560-nm particles [20]. Furthermore, binding of negatively charged CF mucus components to the gene complexes may change their surface charge and size, resulting in a decreased transport of the lipoplex through the mucus and therefore in a decreased cellular uptake [21].",

The intravenous route may make it possible to access the basolateral membrane of airway epithelial cells, characterised by a higher rate of endocytosis and an increased density of viral receptors. However, the difficulties in overcoming the large number of barriers between the vascular compartment and airway epithelial cells (endothelial cells, endothelial cell basement membrane, interstitium and epithelial basement membrane) make this route challenging. A large number of studies have been conducted to identify which cells in the lung are transduced after intravenous (i.v.) injection of liposome\u2013DNA complexes. Most of these have concluded that the majority of the cells transfected are the pulmonary endothelial cells, with some studies reporting transfection of type I/II alveolar epithelial cells [30]. Only a few studies have reported airway epithelial cell transfection after i.v. injection of cationic lipid\u2013DNA complexes [31], [32]. Recently, Koehler et al., have reported \u03b2-galactosidase expression in nasal and bronchial epithelium and tracheal submucosal glands for the first time, after i.v. injection of DODAC\u2013DOPE liposomes. This may have been due to properties of this specific formulation (such as a longer circulation time) since similar results were not obtained when other GTAs such as DOTAP\u2013DOPE, DC-Chol\u2013DOPE. GL-67A and 22 kDa PEI were administered [32].",

Pre-existing immunity from antibodies to wild-type viruses, such as adenovirus and AAV, could hinder their ability to target epithelial cells efficiently. A survey of normal and CF subjects has shown that virtually all subjects had antibodies to Ad5 and to AAV2 (the two most used viral vectors so far), although only 55 and 32%, respectively, were neutralising antibodies [33].

The hypothesis is that reduction in binding may be due to differences in surface charge between poorly and well-differentiated cells. While poorly differentiated cells exhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis, pinocytosis and phagocytosis, well-differentiated cell were only capable of receptor-mediated endocytosis [37]. Some reports have indicated that cell proliferation may influence cationic lipid-mediated transfection activity, either by making epithelial cells themselves more susceptible to transfection or by temporary disruption of the tight junctions [38]. This would allow the lipoplexes to either access the basolateral surface of well-differentiated cells or to access more immature, less differentiated cells.",

This can be achieved by using Ca2+ chelator agents, such as EGTA [41], [42], non-ionic detergents, such as polidocanol [43], and antibodies able to block the function of proteins involved in the tight junction-complex, such as E-cadherin [44]. In addition, medium-chain fatty acids, such as sodium caprate, have been shown to be better agents for enhancing gene transfer than EGTA, via disruption of claudin-1, a major structural component of the tight junctions [45]. Croyle et al. recently found that a blend of sucrose, mannitol and Pluronic F68 enhances adenoviral-mediated gene expression in both large and small lung airways. This formulation was shown to increase tight junction permeability and allow the use of 1/2 log lower viral dose [46]. Airway instillation of perfluorochemical (PFC) liquid can also transiently open tight junctions, enhancing adenoviral- [47], AAV [48] and cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer [49], although this procedure can increase inflammation.",

The neutral lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) is generally employed as a fusogenic helper lipid in a cationic lipid\u2013DNA complex. The second approach involves using a DNA delivery system with a high buffering capacity and the flexibility to swell when protonated. The rationale that endosomes can be ruptured if the pH drop in the late endosome is inhibited by the buffering capacity of the formulation led to the use of pH-sensitive liposomes and polyethylenimine as gene transfer agents [64]. Because of the great number of secondary amines, PEI behaves as a \u2018proton sponge\u2019, able to buffer the low pH in the endosomes, resulting in the inhibition of the low pH-activated nucleases.

Each NPC is comprised of a large family of proteins (nucleoporins) forming a structure in which a central channel is surrounded by eight peripheral channels. It is thought that the peripheral channels, about 9\u201310 nm diameter, allow small solutes and proteins up to 50\u201360 kDa to freely diffuse in an out the nucleus. Larger proteins need a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) in order to be actively transported through the central channel of the pore. Under physiological conditions, a supercoiled pDNA has a diameter of 10 nm or larger if in a relaxed conformation, thus suggesting that passive diffusion of pDNA through the NPC is highly unlikely [72]. Therefore, targeting of pDNA to nuclear \u2018shuttle\u2019 proteins has become part of the design of GTAs developed to transfer non-dividing cells, as in CF gene therapy.",

With regard to the latest approach, most of the studies published so far have used the NLS of the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen because its trafficking to the nucleus is well characterised and has also shown to mediate nuclear import of non-karyophilic proteins. By using this \u2018piggyback\u2019 approach, Sebestyen et al. demonstrated nuclear accumulation in digitonin-permeabilised cells, but failed to show uptake of the modified DNA in nuclei of intact cells. This suggests that covalent modification of pDNA with a signal peptide may alter its behaviour and interaction with other cellular factors [73]. By capping a luciferase gene with a single NLS peptide, Zanta et al. showed a 10\u20131000-fold increase in gene transfer efficiency [74].

The advantage over the other strategies is that the NLS peptide can be linked to very specific regions of plasmid DNA, with no effects on the transcription of genes located elsewhere on the plasmid. Furthermore, a precise number of NLS-motifs can be attached and large quantities of the modified pDNA obtained [75]. However, up to now, none of the strategies described has been used to enhance nuclear import and gene transfer expression in airway epithelial cells in vivo. In addition to this, there are reports suggesting that some polycations, such as PEI [71] and lactosylated poly-l-lysine [76], may facilitate the nuclear uptake of pDNA and that, unlike lipoplexes, the complexes remain intact during nuclear translocation. This might suggest the existence of nuclear import pathways distinct from the conventional NLS one.",

The first reconstitutes gene expression from two independent rAAV vectors, each encoding unique, non-overlapping halves of a transgene. The overlapping vector approach uses homologous recombination between overlapping regions in two independent vectors [97]. Preliminary results seem to indicate that the trans-splicing approach is 4\u201310-fold more efficient than the overlapping approach [98].",

Associated with this were elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 that peaked at day 1\u20132 post-instillation, but resolved to normal limits by day 14 [101].

Compared with DNA of eukaryotic origin, bacterial genomic DNA contains a 20-fold higher frequency of the dinucleotide sequence CpG. Further, unlike eukaryotic DNA, in which approximately 80% of the cytosines are methylated, bacterial DNA is relatively unmethylated. Instillation of bacterial DNA or oligonucleotides containing immunostimulatory CpG motifs into mouse lungs resulted in inflammation of the lower respiratory tract [103]. Several strategies have been employed to decrease the immunostimulatory properties of pDNA, including (i) methylation of CpG sequences [104], (ii) reduction of the CpG frequency by eliminating non-essential regions or by site-directed mutagenesis [105] and (iii) the use of inhibitors of the CpG signalling pathway, such as chloroquine or quinacrine [105]. Independent of the strategy used, the CpG-reduced pDNAs were found to be less pro-inflammatory. However, methylation of the CpG motifs can severely reduce the expression of the transgene [104].",

The transcriptional activity of the widely used cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (CMV) is highly robust, but prone to inactivation over time. Cytokines induced by adenovirus- or plasmid-mediated gene delivery have been shown to down-regulate CMV-driven expression. For this reason, many investigators have evaluated alternative promoters, with many showing increased persistence. These include the polyubiquitin C promoter (high-level transgene expression for up to 8 weeks and still detectable after 6 months), the elongation factor 1\u03b1 promoter (expression up to 4 weeks) [108] and the CMV\u2013ubiquitin B hybrid promoter (expression up to 3 months, with 50% of day 2 levels remaining at day 84) [109]. Similar prolonged transgene expression was obtained when the E4 region from adenovirus 2 or simply the open reading frame 3 (ORF3) of E4 were cloned upstream of the CMV promoter on a plasmid backbone [110]. However, a potential disadvantage of this approach is the immunogenicity of the E4 ORF3 product once expressed in the transfected cell, thereby limiting its usefulness in vivo. In addition, there is growing evidence that genomic sequences, either within or flanking the gene, might be essential to provide in vivo long-term expression [111].",

The amplification of functional correction reflects the fact that Cl\u2212 can move via gap junctions from non-corrected cells into adjacent corrected cells for secretion. An in vivo study has shown that 5% of the normal level of Cftr gene expression can correct the chloride abnormality (50% of normal) and, importantly, the intestinal pathology seen in mice with CF [117]. However, different levels of correction may be required to restore the various functions of CFTR. The relationship between efficiency of gene transfer and normalisation of sodium transport is likely to be linear, reflecting the fact that CFTR directly regulates ENaC channels within individual cells. This suggests that virtually every affected cell (100%) should be corrected [116]. The level of transfection required for other functions of CFTR to be restored, e.g., sulphation/sialylation defects or transport of other molecules, remains unknown and appears to depend on the cell type transduced and the GTA used. Zhang et al. showed that cationic liposome-mediated CFTR transfer achieved very low transgene expression with insignificant correction of the chloride defect, but mucus sulphation was reduced to levels seen in non-CF airways. The converse was seen with adenovirus that, despite higher levels of expression, did not transduce goblet cells [118]. In addition, the route of administration itself seems to have a role with regard to the localisation of the delivered gene. Instillation of GTAs into the mouse lungs results predominantly in transfection of the alveolar and terminal bronchial cells, while, when they are aerosolised, a higher level of transfection is observed in the airway epithelium [119]. Aerosolisation is more likely to lead to a more even deposition of the GTAs throughout the lung than could be attained by instillation, which presumably primarily deposits the complexes in the parenchyma.",

To counterbalance the poor gene transfer efficiency with current GTAs, very strong non-specific viral promoters such as RSV and CMV have been used to drive transgene expression. However, because the number of CFTR molecules per respiratory epithelial cell is low (20\u2013100 channel proteins/cell) and that the CFTR protein regulates other ionic channels implicated in water and salt secretion, it is possible that high levels of CFTR expression may perturb the function of other proteins or alter physiological properties of the cell. It has been reported that a high level of CFTR expression can cause growth arrest and increased cell volume [120], [121], thus suggesting that either regulatable expression cassettes [121] or epithelium-specific promoters, such as that for the human cytokeratin 18 gene, will have to be used to drive CFTR expression. To produce more physiological CFTR expression other approaches such as the use of (i) genomic context vectors in which CFTR expression is driven by its natural promoter and regulatory sequences and (ii) \u2018gene targeting\u2019 molecules, such as RNA\u2013DNA chimeric oligos and small DNA fragments for homologous replacement may be needed.

The SMaRT process uses pre-therapeutic RNA molecules (PTMs) that are designed to base pair with the intron of a targeted pre-mRNA to suppress target cis-splicing while enhancing trans-splicing between the PTM and target. The aim is to repair mutant pre-mRNA molecules and generate full length repaired mRNA that is translated and processed into mature CFTR protein [126]. In an in vivo model of \u0394F508 CF airway epithelia, Liu et al. showed that human CF bronchial xenografts infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding a PTM targeted to CFTR intron 9 demonstrated partial correction of CFTR-mediated Cl\u2212 permeability to 22% of that seen in non-CF xenograft [127]. This strategy would allow a more physiological expression of CFTR, as previously discussed. Furthermore, as PTM expression cassettes can be much smaller than those encoding full-length cDNAs, SMaRT also allows for the use of smaller and less immunogenic vectors, such as rAAV with limited packaging capacity. However, the very high titres required to achieve correction and the potential of trans-splicing into non-CFTR mRNAs are disadvantages which should not be ignored.",

Viral vector introduced into amniotic fluid of mice, rats, sheep and rabbits results in reporter gene expression in both pulmonary and gastrointestinal epithelia. Transgene expression was also demonstrated in pulmonary epithelia after intratracheal instillation of vector in utero. Persistence of transgene expression in the lung ranged from 14 to 30 days post-infection. Most of these studies have been carried out with adenoviral vectors, and many have led to substantial inflammation and subsequent foetal loss. Fewer adverse events have been observed when AAV is used. Retroviral vector use for applications in utero has been limited because the amniotic fluid reduces infectivity (see Ref.
