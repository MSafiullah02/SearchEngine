            "text": "Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are members of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) that can cause severe respiratory illness and/or encephalitis in a wide variety of mammals, including humans (Selvey et al. 1995; Chua et al. 1999). HeV was identified as the causative agent of an acute respiratory disease in horses in 1994 in Queensland, Australia (Selvey et al. 1995) and to date there have now been 32 outbreaks in Australia since, with at least one or more occurrences per year since 2006. Every outbreak of HeV has involved horses as the initial infected host and there have been a total of seven human cases arising from exposure to infected horses. Four human fatalities have occurred (Playford et al. 2010) with the most recent occurring in August 2009 (Anonymous 2009). NiV was first identified during an outbreak of severe encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998\u20131999 with at least 265 human cases and 105 deaths, with pigs serving as the intermediate amplifying host (Chua et al. 1999; Paton et al. 1999; Goh et al. 2000; Chua 2003). Since 1998 there have been more than a dozen recognized occurrences of human NiV infection, primarily in Bangladesh and India (Chadha et al. 2006; Harit et al. 2006; Luby et al. 2009b; Arankalle et al. 2011). In the majority of subsequent spillover events, the mortality rate among humans has been higher (~ 75%) along with evidence of multiple rounds of person-to-person transmission (Gurley et al. 2007; Homaira et al. 2010).",

In addition, the availability of well characterized animal models is essential for fulfilling the critical needs for the in vivo evaluation of potential prophylactic and antiviral modalities for human use. Of particular importance, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule which came into effect in 2002. This rule specifically applies to the development of medical countermeasures when human efficacy studies are not possible or ethical, such as is often the case with highly virulent emerging pathogens like the henipaviruses. Essentially, this rule allows for the evaluation of vaccines or therapeutics using data derived from studies carried out in two animal models. Here, we provide a literature review of small and large animal models of HeV and NiV infection.",

(2009b)]. NiV human infection reveals central nervous system (CNS) vascular pathology as more severe in comparison to other organ systems, with necrosis, edema and inflammation often associated with viral antigen (Wong et al. 2002). Systemic vasculitis, extensive thrombosis, and parenchymal necrosis, particularly within the CNS, along with endothelial cell damage, evident syncytia and widespread presence of viral antigen in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. Viral antigen was also present in various parenchymal cells, notably in neurons, and NiV infection of endothelial cells and neurons along with vasculitis and thrombosis seem to be critical to the pathogenesis of NiV infection in humans (Wong et al. 2002; Wong and Ong 2011).",

The majority of human cases of NiV infection in Malaysia presented with acute encephalitis with ~25% of cases also showing respiratory signs (Chua 2003); however, it was noted that neurological disease could present later (>10 weeks) following a nonencephalitic, asymptomatic infection, or patients who recovered from acute encephalitis. Relapsed-encephalitis presented from several months to as late as 4 years after infection (Wong et al. 2001; Tan et al. 2002; Chong and Tan 2003; Tan and Wong 2003). A recent comparative analysis of the first two fatal human cases of HeV infection (acute respiratory and relapsed encephalitis) has been reported (Wong et al. 2009). Immuno- and histopathological findings showed that HeV was neurotropic in both cases and could cause CNS infections that can result in either acute encephalitis (in the absence of apparent clinical encephalitis) or relapsed encephalitis with pathological features similar to acute and relapsed NiV encephalitis. How these viruses escape immunological clearance for such an extended period is unknown, and relapsed or late onset encephalitis are considered to be caused by recrudescence and replication of virus within the CNS (Tan et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2009). To our knowledge, attempts to recreate this recrudescence process of HeV or NiV infection in an animal model has not been attempted although several groups have proposed it.",

Serological evidence of natural NiV infection among other animals revealed that dogs in those areas associated with the farms in the Malaysian outbreak were susceptible to NiV infection (Field et al. 2001). Diseased dogs however were uncommon, and only two animals (one found dead and another sick) were examined (Hooper et al. 2001; Wong and Ong 2011). A more recent assessment of natural NiV infection in dogs by serological analysis has confirmed that natural infection is possible, but the presence of NiV does not appear to be maintained within the population in an absence of infected pigs (Mills et al. 2009). Subsequent NiV outbreaks have occurred nearly every year in Bangladesh and India since its discovery in Malaysia in 1999 (Harit et al. 2006; Luby et al. 2009b; Arankalle et al. 2011); however, these appearances of the virus have all been associated with severe disease and high fatality rates in humans, with more than half of these cases attributed to person-to-person transmission (Luby et al. 2009b; Homaira et al. 2010). The initial introduction of the virus into humans was primarily associated with the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with NiV from bats (Luby et al. 2009a; Rahman et al. 2011); however, a few cases were associated with contact with sick animals including cows (Hsu et al. 2004), pigs, and diseased goats (Luby et al. 2009a). Experimental infection of a variety of animals with HeV, NiV, or both has since been carried out by a number of laboratories with most of the species that were noted to be susceptible to natural infection, including fruit bats, and these will be discussed below.",

A series of other animal infection experiments were conducted with HeV soon after its discovery in 1994 at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories (AAHL). A challenge experiment was carried out in mice, guinea pigs, rats, chickens, rabbits, cats, and dogs, each of which were challenged with a 5,000 TCID50 dose of HeV by subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation (Westbury et al. 1995). Mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, and dogs did not develop any signs of clinical disease, and only cats and guinea pigs developed HeV disease. Two of two cats developed respiratory distress and inappetance by the 5th and 6th day and both succumbed to infection a day later, while four of five guinea pigs developed similar clinical signs between day 7 and 12 each died a day following disease onset. The remaining guinea pig remained well and did not develop HeV neutralizing antibody. At necropsy, both cats and guinea pigs exhibited gross pathological lesions of pneumonia with cats having a more severe presentation, and histologically these lesions were similar to those reported from horses that died of HeV disease (Murray et al. 1995a, b). Virus could also be isolated from a variety of tissue samples from infected cats and guinea pigs. No lesions were observed in any of the other animal species tested; however, rats, rabbits, and one dog seroconverted, while mice and chickens did not. A limited number of experimental horse inoculations with HeV were also carried out which essentially reproduced the clinical and pathological findings reported from equine field cases (Hooper et al. 1997a), characterized as a systemic vascular disease and parenchymal infection in a wide variety of organs with severe lesions in the lungs with hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis and syncytia in the endothelium of pulmonary vessels. Vascular and parenchymal lesions were also seen in the heart, kidney, brain, spleen, lymph node, and stomach. Follow-up HeV infection experiments carried out at the AAHL focused on the cat and guinea pig models (Westbury et al. 1996; Hooper et al. 1997b; Williamson et al. 1998, 2000, 2001).",

The first animal infection experiments with NiV were also conducted at the AAHL as early as 1999, and these included pigs, cats, and bats (Hooper et al. 2001; Middleton et al. 2002). Both nervous and respiratory disease with fever was reproduced in pigs, between day 7 and 9, by s.c. inoculation with a 50,000 TCID50 dose of NiV (a nonplaque purified, low passaged isolate obtained from the CNS of a fatal human case in Malaysia), while pigs exposed orally or by in-contact with infected pigs resulted in active infection with virus shedding in respiratory secretions, particularly from tonsillar swabs, but in the absence of any significant clinical signs or pathological findings. Diseased pigs exhibited histological evidence of systemic vasculitis, alveolitis, and meningitis with some endothelial syncytia, along with detectable viral antigen (Middleton et al. 2002). In this same study, two cats that were inoculated oronasally with the same dose of virus were more severely diseased than pigs and became febrile and depressed with increased respiratory rates by day 6. One animal progressed to severe breathing difficulty and was euthanized and second began to recover by day 10 (Middleton et al. 2002). The clinical and pathological findings were comparable to those observed in HeV-infected cats (Westbury et al. 1996) but infection of the respiratory tract was more severe. Virus could be recovered from urine, tonsils, and blood. The pathological findings by histological and immunohistochemical analysis also revealed the systemic vasculitis, alveolitis, and meningitis in a field a case of NiV infection in a cat with most severely affected organs being the brain, kidney, liver, and lung (Hooper et al. 2001; Middleton et al. 2002).",

The clinical response to either HeV or NiV infection in guinea pigs has been reported to be often mild and variable, ranging from an inapparent infection following challenge to sudden death. Further, in several reports, only a proportion of animals presented with clinical signs, such as transient weight loss, depression, ataxia, lethargy, and twitching (Williamson et al. 2001; Wong et al. 2003). One study demonstrated that intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation with high doses of NiV (107 PFU) resulted only a transient fever with minor weight loss after 5\u20137 days and later recovered (Wong et al. 2003). Another study conducted a 50,000 TCID50 challenge with NiV by i.p. administration, and here also only three of eight animals exhibited any signs of clinical disease which were only ruffled fur, mild behavioral changes, and ataxia (Middleton et al. 2007). The vascular tropism of HeV infection in guinea pigs is evident in many organs and when severe disease occurred death from widespread vascular disease was apparently the cause (Hooper et al. 1997b; Torres-Velez et al. 2008). In a model of HeV encephalitis in the guinea pig, it was reported that only a proportion of infected animals would develop encephalitis with virus observed in blood vessels and neurons (Williamson et al. 2001). The general consensus of the guinea pig is that it is not a suitable animal model for challenge and protection studies.",

            "text": "NiV infection of pigs is frequently asymptomatic, this was especially noted following natural infections but also later during experimental challenge of pigs with NiV by the ocular and oronasal route (Mohd Nor et al. 2000; Middleton et al. 2002; Weingartl et al. 2006; Berhane et al. 2008; also refer to the chapter on Henipaviruses in their natural host (Middleton and Weingartl, this issue). When symptoms were apparent, they varied in relation to the age of the pig, with older animals predominantly exhibiting a neurological disease syndrome in contrast to younger pigs which primarily presented with a respiratory syndrome. The virus manifests respiratory and neurologic tropisms in both asymptomatic and clinical infections (Middleton et al. 2002; Weingartl et al. 2005). In pigs, neurological disease manifested as trembling, twitches, muscle spasms, and uncoordinated gait (Mohd Nor et al. 2000). NiV challenge of younger pigs by the ocular and oronasal routes revealed that virus replication occurs in the oropharnyx and then spreads sequentially to the upper respiratory tract and submandibular lymph nodes, followed by replication in the lower respiratory tract, and additional lymphoid tissues (Weingartl et al. 2005). Virus replication and presence of detectable viral antigen can be widespread and accompanied by frequent syncytial cell formation, which is particularly evident in clinically ill animals, resulting from virus tropism and replication in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of medium to large veins and arteries within the respiratory system, CNS, and lymphoid tissues (Hooper et al. 2001; Middleton et al. 2002; Weingartl et al. 2005). NiV has also been reported to invade the CNS by route of the cranial nerves and crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier (Weingartl et al. 2005). Infectious NiV could also be recovered from a wide variety of tissues in the infected pig, including tonsil, nasal, and throat swabs and lung, but only infrequently recovered from the urine of shedding animals (Daniels et al. 2001; Middleton et al. 2002; Weingartl et al. 2005).",

Horses have been identified to have been naturally infected, and some do survive and some can experience asymptomatic infection with seroconversion (Murray et al. 1995a, b; Williamson et al. 1998). HeV infection in horses yields a predominantly respiratory syndrome initially with elevated heart rate and fever which can rapidly progress to more severe respiratory disease. In field cases, the airways are often filled with a blood-tinged frothy exudate but this has not been experimentally reproduced, and could be a result of the infecting dose of virus. In addition, signs of neurological disease can occur but appear less frequent and have been reported in both terminally ill horses as well as in horses that recovered from HeV infection (Rogers et al. 1996; Williamson et al. 1998).",

HeV infection was characterized by pulmonary edema and congestion, hemorrhage, thrombosis of capillaries, necrosis, and syncytial cells in the endothelium of pulmonary vessels. Additional HeV challenge experiments in horses have detailed the presence of viral antigen in endothelial cells in a wide variety of organs including lungs, lymph nodes, kidneys, spleen, bladder, and meninges. Virus can be recovered from a number of internal organs, including lung, and from saliva and urine (Murray et al. 1995a, b; Hooper et al. 1997a; Williamson et al. 1998; Marsh et al. 2011). The development of an experimental model of HeV infection in horses has been important for understanding the pathogenesis of the virus and the associated risk of transmission to humans, and will also be critical for the testing of vaccines against HeV infection of horses.",

HeV or NiV infection and the resulting disease in cats closely resembles the respiratory disease presentation that is seen in naturally occurring HeV-infected horses, often with copious frothy sanguineous fluid in the bronchi and hemorrhage or congestion of the tracheal epithelium (Hooper et al. 1997b). Virus replication and resulting systemic vasculitis is present in both arteries and arterioles and syncytia are observed in the endothelia especially in the lungs, but also in gastrointestinal, spleen, and lymphoid organs.",

A notable difference between NiV and HeV infection of cats is the extensive degree to which NiV, but not HeV, infects the respiratory epithelium (Middleton et al. 2002). In addition, NiV can transplacentally infect and replicate in fetal tissues with high levels of recoverable virus from the placenta and uterine fluid (Mungall et al. 2007). Taken together, despite some limitations, particularly that henipavirus encephalitis in the cat has not been experimentally reproduced these studies indicated that the cat was a viable and reproducible animal model for lethal henipavirus infection and disease. The cat model has been successfully used in challenge and protection experiments in the evaluation of a subunit vaccine for NiV (McEachern et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Studies in hamsters have yielded different results following NiV infection. One study showed that pathological lesions were most severe and extensive in the hamster brain (Wong et al. 2003). In this study hamsters succumbed 5\u20139 days after i.p. administration of 100\u201310,000 PFU and 24 h after the appearance of tremors and limb paralysis. In this same study, hamsters inoculated i.n. with doses as high as 103\u2013106 PFU succumbed between 9 and 15 days after NiV challenge, displaying progressive deterioration with limb paralysis, lethargy, limb twitching, and breathing difficulties. Vascular pathology was observed in a range of organs, including brain, lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and viral antigen and genome were found in endothelial cells. The vascular and parenchyma lesions were consistent with CNS-mediated clinical signs. A more recent study reported that hamsters inoculated i.n. or i.p. with 105 TCID50 succumbed within 5 days after exposure to NiV while hamsters inoculated i.n. or i.p. with 102 TCID50 died by day 12 after NiV challenge (Rockx et al. 2011). This study also reported that disease in hamsters exposed to higher doses of NiV resulted in acute respiratory distress (ARDS) whereas infection of hamsters with lower doses of NiV resulted in the development of neurological signs and more systemic spread of the virus through involvement of the endothelium. It is unclear why one study using doses of 103 to 106 PFU caused a disease dominated by neurologic signs (Wong et al. 2003) where a similar study using a similar dose (105 TCID50) caused a disease dominated by respiratory signs (Rockx et al. 2011). The NiV hamster model has been successfully used in experiments to evaluate several vaccines and postexposure treatments (Guillaume et al. 2004, 2006; Georges-Courbot et al. 2006; Freiberg et al. 2010).",

Histopathological lesions included severe focal necrotizing alveolitis, vasculitis, degeneration of glomerular tufts, and focal necrosis in a wide-range of other tissues. Significant amounts of viral antigen are present in blood vessel walls and endothelial syncytia are frequently present. Viral antigen was also present in the brain parenchyma including neurons and infectious NiV was isolated from multiple organs including the brain.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of viral antigen, predominantly in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, along with associated pathology. In addition, and of importance to the similarity of disease seen in humans, most infected AGMs have shown evidence of henipavirus-induced neurologic disease, with severe congestion (Fig. 1d) and evidence of meningeal hemorrhaging and edema. In the CNS, viral antigen was detected in endothelial cells in brain along with infection of neurons (Fig. 1e) and typically widespread in the brainstem. As was shown in the hamster models for henipavirus infection challenge dose appears to have some influence on the disease course and pathology. In general, AGM exposed to lower doses of NiV (<105 PFU) survive longer than animals exposed to higher doses of NiV (>105 PFU) with animals that succumb earlier showing more respiratory signs of disease and animals surviving longer showing more neurologic signs of disease (Geisbert and Broder Unpublished).",

Neither HeV or NiV productively infects or causes disease in typical small animal models, including mice or rabbits (reviewed in Bossart et al. (2007) and Bishop and Broder (2008)). Among other smaller animal models explored, the response to either HeV or NiV in guinea pigs was reported to be highly variable. Although a generalized vascular disease was observed with HeV in guinea pigs there was little or no pulmonary edema (Hooper et al. 1997b; Williamson et al. 2001). Infection of guinea pigs with high doses of NiV (107 PFU) showed only transient clinical signs followed by recovery (Wong et al. 2003) and another study using a high dose of virus by intraperitoneal administration produced disease in less than half of challenged animals (Middleton et al. 2007). There have also been some potential limitations noted in two other well-characterized animal models, the cat and hamster (Westbury et al. 1996; Hooper et al. 1997b; Wong et al. 2003; Mungall et al. 2006, 2007), particularly no overt CNS pathogenesis or respiratory disease, respectively. Of the small animal models evaluated to date, only the recently described ferret models of HeV and NiV infection exhibited both severe respiratory and neurological disease and generalized vasculitis in which the underlying pathology closely resembled henipavirus-mediated disease seen in humans (Bossart et al. 2009). Not surprisingly, the animal model which appears to most faithfully reproduce human henipavirus infection is the AGM (Geisbert et al. 2010; Rockx et al. 2010; Bossart et al. 2011).",
