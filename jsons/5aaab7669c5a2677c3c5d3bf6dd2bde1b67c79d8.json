In Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces as well as Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (hereafter Xinjiang), where the epidemic was initially driven by injecting drug use, the key emphasis has been on counseling and testing, as well as active case-finding and targeted interventions, including harm reduction capacity-building and follow-up services for PLWH . Beijing municipality, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia), Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia), and Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet) have concentrated epidemics among key populations, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM; Wu et al. 2013) . In these provinces, the primary emphasis has been on studying the epidemic among key populations and supporting innovative, targeted prevention, care, and treatment activities and capacity building among the local implementing units.

The strategy aimed to decrease the number of new infections by (a) targeting disease surveillance to enable evidence-based public health programming and decision-making, (b) linking PLWH to prevention support services to prevent secondary transmission, and (c) improving access to, and quality of, care and treatment services. Specifically, GAP supported the establishment or strengthening of 649 national or provincial sentinel surveillance sites in 15 provinces and further ensured that these sites were actively providing linkages for those individuals who were found to have HIV infection. As a result, the number of sentinel surveillance sites increased sixfold during the period from 2003 to 2008, and 18,820 PLWH received diagnoses at these sites. This activity increased the coverage and quality of surveillance information available for decision-making, while also increasing local capacity for developing referral systems, care linkages, and case management capacity . Over the subsequent years, these surveillance sites have been transitioned to local public health authorities and continue to function as an important tool for both local and national public health decision-making. GAP has also supported an external evaluation of the adequacy of the HIV surveillance system in China (Lin et al. 2012) , and the findings of this evaluation have been used by national authorities for further system strengthening (see Chap. 2 for more information).",

Again, the national program called for implementation of a public health approach based on increased rates of case finding, epidemiological investigation, CD4 testing, and follow-up services. As part of the China-US collaboration, pilot programs were established in Yunnan and Guangxi to increase the proportion of individuals who knew their status and increase the number of PLWH who completed at least two linked follow-up visits for care and support. These pilot efforts were carried out from 2006 to 2011, and the epidemiological investigation rate rose from 25% to 99% in Yunnan and 31% to 99% in Guangxi. Since 2009, these measures have served as national core indicators for all provinces, with similar improvements over time-a key contributor to program success at the national level (see Chap. 23 for more information).",

Particularly in the rural areas hardest hit by the iatrogenic, plasma donation-related epidemic of the 1990s, it became apparent that the healthcare providers did not have adequate training or clinical mentoring to provide quality HIV care and treatment to increasing numbers of patients on ART. In close collaboration with the NCAIDS Division of Treatment and Care at China CDC and the Clinton Foundation, the US CDC established China's first rural AIDS Clinical Training Center in 2004 in Lixin county, Anhui province. Its mission was to provide in-service AIDS clinical training to rural clinicians selected from local Anhui and other high epidemic provinces in China. These clinicians had little training or experience dealing with patients on ART, and the Center's intensive 10-week residential training program included classroom training, direct clinical mentoring, and outreach within the local area to township and local hospitals. This approach proved extremely successful. The model was replicated in two additional provinces in the later years of the GAP collaboration, and in 2011, leadership for the training center in Anhui was transitioned to the provincial government (see Chap. 27 for more information).",

GAP helped to demonstrate that with conservative cost estimates, integrated nationwide HIV and syphilis testing of pregnant women in prenatal care in China was substantially more cost-effective than HIV screening alone (Owusu-Edusei et al. 2014) . Comprehensive, integrated PMTCT efforts were highly effective in reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission to very low levels whether in rural or urban settings (Shan et al. 2014; Song et al. 2013) . In 2007, GAP started to collaborate with the Guangxi Women and Community Health Bureau and the Guangxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital to pilot an integrated PMTCT program in 112 antenatal care clinics (ANCs). By fostering integration across China's three-tier health system, ANC, and ART services, this program successfully linked women with HIV infection and their children to HIV care and treatment. It was shown to be an effective model that was expanded first to the entirety of Guangxi where the approach continues to deliver results. From 2009 to 2011, 174,776 pregnant women (97%) were tested for HIV, with 728 (0.41%) diagnosed with HIV infection. HIV testing coverage during pregnancy significantly increased from 80% in 2009 to 87% in 2010 and to 91% in 2011. From 2009 to 2010, 12 out of 379 infants born to HIV-infected women tested HIV-positive, for a transmission rate of 3.2%. In part thanks to these early results, the National Center for Women and Children's Health (NCWCH) expanded coverage and implemented this program in all seven of the highest prevalence provinces in China. By 2015, the comprehensive, integrated PMTCT program was implemented nationwide by the Chinese government (see Chap. 15 for more information).",

The primary objective of the survey was to better understand risk perceptions and behaviors of low-to medium-fee FSW in China as well as seroprevalence rates of HIV, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in this population. A total of 1487 eligible low-fee and medium-fee FSW were recruited in the study. Findings have been published in close collaboration with NCAIDS and show that low-fee FSW were more likely to have HSV-2 infection, but not more likely to have HIV or syphilis infection, compared with medium-fee FSW. The survey also demonstrated that low-fee FSW in China have unique risks for acquiring STIs, in part due to greater economic pressures (Han et al. 2016) . Tailored interventions targeting low-fee FSW, in particular, that incorporate prevailing condom use negotiation challenges are urgently needed. The potential for prevention methods alternative to male condoms has received greater attention in recent years including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and female condoms. Gaining knowledge on awareness and acceptability of these prevention methods among high-risk FSW in China will help inform the potential implementation of these prevention methods in China (see Chaps. 3 and 7 for more information).",

Although less than 10% of China's population belong to one of the 55 recognized ethnic minority groups in China, people with minority affiliation have a higher burden of HIV infection on aggregate (i.e., when all minorities are lumped together and compared to Han Chinese despite each individual minority group having greater or lesser odds of HIV when taken alone; Pan et al. 2016) . Therefore, in 2010, GAP established a second rural clinical training center in Luzhai county, Guangxi, an area with a significant heterosexual and drug use-driven HIV epidemic. Then in 2012, collaborating with Merck Foundation, local CDC authorities, and NCAIDS, GAP established the Zhaojue training center in Zhaojue county, Sichuan province. This hard-hit area had a primarily injecting drug use-driven HIV epidemic among the Yi ethnic minority group. The training facility in Zhaojue (funded by GAP) provided ongoing mentoring to 20 local clinicians and helped treat over 200 additional PLWH from the Yi community between 2013 and 2014.",

By targeting key populations for HIV prevention and early initiation of treatment as key strategies, new techniques and management concepts were introduced and adapted to the Chinese context. With valuable experiences and momentum, many of these models developed in the first decade of implementation of the GAP and NCAIDS technical collaboration were replicated and expanded nationwide. Chinese technical experts at the GAP office have a unique ability to market the evidence to key stakeholders and to build bridges at provincial and national levels. A productive working relationship with well-conceived models, a results-based activity implementation plan, and proper linkage to the domestic policy process have made significant contributions to further strengthening HIV control and prevention in China.",
