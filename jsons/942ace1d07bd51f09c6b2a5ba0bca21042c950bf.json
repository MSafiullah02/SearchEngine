To this end, the NHS England guidance continues to recommend primary PCI for STEMI and angiography with a view to revascularisation for all non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) patients, except perhaps the lowest risk group. This advice is based upon the assumption that the access to the cath lab and its specialised staff will remain stable. Clearly, in circumstances in which lab access is compromised by staff shortage or case load, hard alternative choices will need to be made. But the fact is that primary PCI for STEMI is associated with the best outcome for these patients, with the lowest mortality, fewest complication rates and shortest hospital stay.

I will address this issue in detail below, in the light of recent PHE updated guidelines about general PPE, and the statement about specific cardiology procedures that was released a few days ago by the presidents of the British Cardiovascular Society (BCS), BCIS and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), and which are endorsed by PHE and the chief medical officers.",
