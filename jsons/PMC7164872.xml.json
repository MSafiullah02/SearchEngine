Having only three hospitals in Italy dedicated exclusively to infectious diseases, L. Sacco Hospital in Milan, the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \u2013 INMI Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome, and Domenico Cotugno Hospital in Naples, in the first phase of the outbreak, we needed to redesign the organization of emergency radiology units in local hospitals to create dedicated tracks for the evaluation of individuals with suspected infection and for patients with known diagnoses. Separation between those subjects who had or were suspected to have COVID-19 and other presumed noninfected patients admitted to the emergency department was the first priority. Having entered the second phase with fewer individuals presenting to the emergency department and an increase in the number of hospitalized patients, the creation of dedicated and protected internal access paths to radiologic services was necessary.",

Ease of disinfection of the equipment and accessibility to bedridden patients were the main reasons for this choice, as suggested by the authors [1]. CXR can easily differentiate between a normal and severely abnormal chest, reducing the need for CT examinations, and it is also useful for monitoring inpatients, together with lung ultrasound, performed by an anesthesiologist. However, CXR sensitivity is low, particularly at an early stage of the disease [3].",

However, considering the high volume of patients with COVID-19 and the length of the sanitization procedures of the CT scanner room in the interval between two consecutive patients, many Italian hospitals have dedicated CT equipment to patients with COVID-19. If this was not possible, they have established specific internal protocols to scan COVID-19-positive patients consecutively and sanitize the CT scanner room at the end of the shift. In a few hospitals in which dedicated CT scanners were not available, or patient volume was too high, mobile CT devices were rented.",
