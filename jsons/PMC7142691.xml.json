The ideal therapeutic approach is still debated and data on subgroups of patients at high risk still scarce(1). We have developed an internal treatment protocol for the management of renal transplant patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (2). Since the first days of March 2020 we re-organised our ward to admit kidney transplant patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia; we felt this rearrangement as necessary since our centre acts as referral for a population of 1200 kidney transplant patients. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, acute transplantation surgery was suspended in our centre from the 20th of February 2020. The first admission of a transplant patient with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia occurred on the 27th of February 2020, the second one six days later and subsequently up to the 24thof March 2020 (day of when this analyses was performed and patients follow-up censored) an average rate of 1.2 kidney transplant patients were admitted per day . We describe here the clinical course and renal outcomes of the first 20 kidney transplant recipients admitted and followed in our unit with pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

As anti-viral therapy is known to interfere with calcineurin inhibitor metabolism, in four patients tacrolimus levels were monitored after these therapeutic changes were instituted. The median trough values before anti-viral therapy were 7.05 ng/ml(IQR 5.5-8.6); one patient had the level re-checked after 3 days with no change compared to baseline, one patient had the level rechecked 4 and 5 days after admission (-17% and -18% compared to baseline), one six days after admission (-12% compared to baseline) and one 8 days after admission (-21% compared to baseline). The median times from symptom onset and admission to these therapeutic changes were respectively 5 days (IQR 3-8.25) for antiviral therapy and 0 days (IQR 0-0) for hydroxychloroquine . During the follow-up one patient had hydroxychloroquine withdrawn due to toxicity (nausea, vomiting) but no prolongation of the cardiac QTc interval compared to baseline or cardiac arrhythmias were observed. Antibiotics were administered to 11/20 kidney transplant recipients (55%): cephalosporins in 64%, beta-lactams in 36%, fluoroquinolones in 25%, carbapenems in 10% and glycopeptides in 5%. During hospitalization chest radiographs were repeated in 15/20 patients and radiological findings worsened in 13/15 (87%). The changes of the main blood tests compared to baseline are shown in Supplementary Figure S1.
