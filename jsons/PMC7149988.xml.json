Stress associated with car journeys or a period in unfamiliar surroundings will increase blood glucose and alter haematological parameters such as the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Pregnancy affects parameters such as protein, haematocrit, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides (Viard-Drouet et al., 1984), glucose, sodium, calcium, phosphate and red cell indices (Palm, 1997). Serum cholesterol is the parameter most affected and can be up to 30% lower in pregnant than in non-pregnant animals (Palm, 1997).",

Historically laboratory data were often derived from populations of rabbits of the same breed, sex and age that are not genetically diverse. In contrast, the pet rabbit population is made up of a variety of breeds and cross-breeds, and is composed of rabbits of all ages. With the increased interest of rabbit owners in pursuing diagnostics for their pets, many commercial labs have built up a vast database of samples from a genetically heterogeneous population. Significant breed and sex differences have been noted for some parameters in laboratory rabbits (Kozma et al., 1974).",

Some reference ranges are an amalgamation of other reference ranges often without addressing the fact that the ranges have been determined using different methodologies. This results in ranges so wide that almost any result will fall within the normal range. For example, the reference range for serum albumin concentrations of pet rabbits is given as 27\u201346 g/L (Malley, 1996) based on four published sets of data. Gillett (1994) gives an even wider range of 27\u201350 g/L for laboratory rabbits based on five sets of data. For some parameters there are big differences between published reference ranges. An example is blood calcium. Gillett (1994) gives a range of 1.5\u20133.4 mmol/L, compared to 3.4\u20134.0 mmol/L given by Harkness and Wagner (1995). Differences in calcium content of the diet between the groups of rabbits or differences in analytical technique could explain these discrepancies. Different laboratory methods can result in large differences between reference ranges. An example is alkaline phosphatase. Collins (1988) gives a reference range of 4.1\u20136.2 IU/L, compared to 10\u201370 IU/L (Gillett, 1994) or 112\u2013350 IU/L (Harkness and Wagner, 1995).Key Points 2.1Physiological effects on blood parameters\n\u2022Digestion: blood glucose is elevated\u2022Diurnal variations: bile acids, cholesterol, urea, differential white cell count\u2022Age: neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio\u2022Stress: neutrophil:lymphocyte distribution\u2022Pregnancy: protein, haematocrit, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides, glucose, sodium, calcium, phosphate, red blood cell indices\u2022Anaesthesia: potassium\n\n",

The red blood cells vary in diameter within a range of 5.0\u20137.8 \u03bcm (Sanderson and Phillips, 1981). This variation in diameter (anisocytosis) is a feature of blood smears from rabbits and is not a significant finding (see Figure 2.1\n). The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measurement of the variation in size of erythrocytes and is higher in rabbits (11\u201315, IDEXX reference range) than in dogs and cats (8\u201310; Bush, 1991). In dogs and cats, anisocytosis is indicative of the presence of reticulocytes and a regenerative anaemia. In rabbits, 1\u20134% of circulating erythrocytes may be reticulotytes. Polychromasia and reticulocytes in rabbit blood smears have been attributed to the short life span and high turnover of erythrocytes (Kraus et al., 1984). Nucleated red cells and Howell\u2013Jolly bodies can also be found occasionally (McLaughlin and Fish, 1994).",

Administration of exogenous adrenaline to rabbits results in redistribution of lymphocytes from spleen and bone marrow to peripheral blood, lungs and liver (Toft et al., 1992a). Conversely, exogenous corticosteroid administration results in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen to the lymphatic tissue in rabbits (Toft et al., 1992b). Prolonged periods of stress cause neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Marked changes in white cell distribution with a relative neutrophilia and lymphopenia were found in a study of cortisol levels and haemograms of rabbits after transport, either by air or by lorry.

Handling alone can cause an increase in blood glucose to the order of 8.5 mmol/L experimentally (Knudtzon, 1988) and 15 mmol/L or more anecdotally. Diabetes mellitus has not been described in pet rabbits and there is some difference of opinion about its importance as a clinical disease (Hoefer, 2000, Jenkins, 2000, Rosenthal, 2000). Herbivorous animals withstand the absence of insulin more readily than carnivorous ones (Bentley, 1998) and are therefore not so susceptible to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus has been induced in laboratory rabbits by the administration of alloxan. It has also been described as a hereditary disease in rabbits. A laboratory strain was selectively bred as an animal model of human diabetes mellitus (Roth and Conaway, 1982). Affected animals were polydipsic, polyuric and polyphagic with severely impaired insulin release. Elevated glycosylated haemoglobin values of 12.2% were observed in the overtly diabetic animals in comparison with 3.9% in normal animals. Increased glycosylated haemoglobin levels did not correlate with plasma glucose concentrations (Cannon and Conaway, 1981). Histologically there was hypergranulation of \u03b2-cells of the islets of Langerhans. Obesity and ketoacidosis were not features of diabetes mellitus in the laboratory rabbits. The hyperglycaemia was in the region of 540\u2013590 mg/dL (30\u201333.4 mmol/L) and there was marked glycosuria.

In a study by Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001), pet rabbits kept under free-range conditions had significantly higher serum albumin concentrations than rabbits suffering from advanced dental disease. They were also significantly higher than rabbits kept in hutches that were not suffering from dental problems. The difference in albumin levels was attributed to differences in diet and husbandry. Caecotrophs are a source of amino acids for rabbits and normal caecotrophy is an important element of their protein metabolism. Low fibre diets, obesity, dental disease or skeletal abnormalities can prevent rabbits ingesting caecotrophs from the anus and reduce the available amino acids for protein synthesis. Rabbits kept in hutches are more likely to be eating a low fibre diet and to suffer from obesity and skeletal problems than rabbits living outside with unrestricted access to natural vegetation and exercise.",

Coronavirus occurs in laboratory rabbits but is an unlikely diagnosis in the pet rabbit. In cases where an elevated globulin level is found, more information can be gleaned from performing serum protein electrophoresis. This will determine whether there is a monoclonal gammopathy (often associated with neoplastic processes in other species) or polyclonal changes. These can help in defining the type of inflammatory changes present and can give supportive information for a presumptive diagnosis. For example, an increase in the gamma globulin range, in association with a positive IgG and IgM titre is strong evidence for active encephalitozoonosis (Varga, unpublished data).",

The rabbit\u2019s urea metabolism is further complicated by urea utilization by caecal microflora during catabolism or during periods of dietary excess. Therefore, small fluctuations in serum urea concentrations are difficult to interpret. Laboratory reference ranges apply to animals that are fed a standard diet and have usually been fed at a specific time of day. Pet rabbits are subject to greater fluctuations in blood urea values due to the variation in diet and other factors, and can have values slightly higher than laboratory reference ranges. Prerenal azotaemia associated with poor renal perfusion occurs during periods of dehydration. The rabbit has a limited capacity to concentrate urea and a greater volume of urine is required when urea load increases (Brewer and Cruise, 1994). Increased blood urea values were recorded in a study by Licois et al. (1978) of young rabbits with diarrhoea experimentally induced with coccidiosis. The authors suggested that the blood urea values rose as a result of intense nitrogen catabolism during weight loss associated with the disease. Water deprivation can lead to blood urea values as high as 40 mmol/L in association with creatinine values in excess of 200 \u03bcmol/L (Harcourt-Brown, unpublished data).

Conversely, asymptomatic rabbits can be seropositive. Therefore serology can only be used as a guide in the diagnosis of E. cuniculi infection. Antibody titres can be helpful in distinguishing between recent and chronic infection. Simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG suggests recent infection.",

Urinary pH is usually 8\u20138.2. Rabbit urine is normally turbid due to the presence of calcium carbonate that can be seen as sediment in collected samples. The urine from anorexic, pregnant, lactating or young rabbits is often clear. The colour of normal urine can vary from pale yellow, to orange, brown or red, mimicking haematuria. Plant porphyrin pigments are the cause of red-coloured urine and can be distinguished from haematuria with urinalysis dipstick tests or microscopy. Alternatively, a Wood\u2019s lamp can be used, as urinary pigments fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999). In addition to the presence of calcium carbonate crystals, oxalate or ammonium magnesium phosphate crystals can also be found in normal rabbit urine. The specific gravity of rabbit urine is difficult to evaluate accurately due to the presence of mineral deposits (Goad et al., 1989) but is approximately 1.003\u20131.036. Traces of glucose and protein can be present in normal rabbit urine. As in other species, rabbit urine can be spun and the sediment examined microscopically for the presence of crystals, red cells, inflammatory cells and bacteria. Cultures can be taken to confirm bacterial infection and aid antibiotic selection. Examination of urine sediment stained with Gram stain can reveal E. cuniculi spores that are oval, strongly Gram-positive with a coiled filament inside (Patton, 2000, Pye and Cox, 1977). Ketones may be detected in the urine of anorexic rabbits and is a poor prognostic sign as it is associated with the development of hepatic lipidosis.",

The first step in faeces examination is to determine which type of faeces has been collected. It is often samples of soft faeces or caecotrophs that are collected for examination because their consistency is abnormally loose or the owner has mistaken uningested caecotrophs for diarrhoea. Microscopically the two types of faeces are completely different. Hard faeces contain indigestible fragments of plant debris and little else. Caecotrophic material contains a wide range of micro-organisms, including large Gram-negative bacilli, Bacteroides, large metachromic staining bacilli and many other bacteria including oval and fusiform rods. In some types of diarrhoea, a mixture of indigestible fragments of plant material can be seen alongside a range of typical caecal micro-organisms. This signifies a failure of the proximal colon to separate the indigestible and digestible fractions of the diet. Coccidial oocysts or eggs of the non-pathogenic oxyurid Passalurus ambiguus can be found in both hard and soft faeces of infected rabbits. Coccidial oocysts can be confused with a non-pathogenic Saccharomyces, a budding sporogenous yeast that can be present in large numbers in rabbit faeces (see Figure 2.2\n).",

The faecal sample was from a 14-week-old, thin rabbit suffering from diarrhoea. Faecal material was emulsified with water before being passed through a fine sieve to remove the coarse debris. The homogenate was then centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The residue was mixed with saturated salt solution and centrifuged again. After the sample had been spun, more saturated salt solution was added to the test tube until a meniscus formed. A cover slip was placed over the meniscus and the sample left for approximately 30 min for the oocysts or worm eggs to float to the top of the tube. At the end of this period, the cover slip and surface film was removed from the test tube, placed on a microscope slide and examined under low power. (B) Eimeria stiedae (high power). Several Eimeria spp. affect rabbits and mixed infections occur. The species can be differentiated by the morphological characteristics of the oocysts. The most pathogenic species is E. stiedae, which causes hepatic coccidiosis (see Section 14.4.1). Eimeria stiedae invades the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and can cause severe liver damage. Oocysts may be seen in faeces from infected rabbits or in smears of bile collected from rabbits during post-mortem examination. The relative sizes of coccidial oocysts and S. guttulatus can be seen in (A) and (B). (Worm eggs are larger than coccidial oocysts. The most common helminth infestation of pet rabbits is Passalurus ambiguus. Adult worms or ova from P. ambiguus may be seen in rabbit faeces. The ova are ovoid, slightly flattened and asymmetrical with a cap at one end.) (Image kindly supplied by Dr Sheelagh Lloyd, Division of Animal Pathology, University of Cambridge.)
