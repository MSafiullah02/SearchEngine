They promote the integration of human, environmental, and animal health through transdisciplinary cooperation and communication and they seek to understand the complex disease interactions between microbes, domesticated animals and wildlife, humans, and their environments as brought about by ongoing globalized networking processes (Rock et al., 2009). The contemporary human\u2013animal relationship \u2013 which is central to this endeavor \u2013 is considered to be \u201ccomplex and profound, ranging from exploitation of livestock for food and anthropomorphisation of animals as pets, to live \u2018wet markets\u2019 and international trade in animal species\u201d (Zinstag et al., 2012, p. 107), and its impact is believed to constitute a threat to all humans on an equal proportion. Most scholars working within this field of research pay particularly close attention to zoonotic diseases \u2013 that is, diseases caused by pathogens that can be transmitted from animals to humans and also from humans to animals (e.g., HIV, influenza, Lassa Fever) \u2013 and aim to explore the health and disease impact caused by a broad ranges of hosts.",

Schwabe in 1984 (Zinstag et al., 2012), the one health movement \u2013 stretching back as far as to pathologist and medical doctor Rudolf Virchow in 1858 \u2013 has its academic roots in veterinary and human medicine but is not limited to those disciplines. In this article, the term \u201cone health\u201d will be used as a general framework for describing a broad range of approaches that aim to think about human and animal health in an integrative way. \u201cOne World One Health,\u201d however, is a trademark protected term resulting from an expert consultation in Canada in 2009 (for a detailed description of \u201cone medicine,\u201d \u201cone health\u201d and \u201cOne Health,\u201d see Zinstag et al., 2011). Today, a wide scope of fields, including those in comparative medicine, public health, the environmental sciences, biochemistry, nursing science, and plant pathology, are taking shape under the umbrella term one health, and integrative approaches are institutionalized in organizations such as the WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization or the Resilience Alliance. However, in spite of this heterogeneity, it seems noteworthy to mention that the social sciences are much less present in the one health research-agenda, and it is in this context that central terms and concepts like \u201cglobalization,\u201d \u201cnature,\u201d or the \u201cbody\u201d might benefit from the integration of a social science perspective.",

Since the 1990s, the holistic idea that human health is closely linked to the social, physical and biological environments that people inhabit has become more prominent, as is reflected, for example, by ecohealth and ecosystem approaches which offer the prospect of understanding these complex interactions and translating them into development strategies. Contributions made through the implementation of ecosystem approaches can be foreseen, for example, in the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (RCW), an intergovernmental treaty aimed at the conservation of wetlands \u2013 ranging from swamps, lakes and mangroves to coral reefs and fens \u2013 and their biological diversity. Since its adoption in 1971, the RCW has provided a framework for international cooperation as well as for national action. Each of the contracting parties, which meet every three years to promote policies and guidelines, have committed themselves to \u201cwork towards the wise use of all their wetlands through national land-use planning, appropriate policies and legislation, management actions, and public education\u201d, to \u201cdesignate suitable wetlands for the List of Wetlands of International Importance [\u2026] and ensure their effective management\u201d, and to \u201ccooperate internationally concerning transboundary wetlands, shared wetland systems, shared species, and development projects that may affect wetlands\u201d (RCW, 2008, p. 2). In its 2012 resolution on \u201cWetlands and health\u201d, a number of possible contributions to the achievements of the UN's Millennium Development Goals are invoked which illustrate the close interrelationship between wetland ecosystems, environmental health and infectious diseases \u2013 and the potential benefits of a programmatic implementation of ecosystem approaches: as many infectious diseases such as diarrhea, cholera or dengue are waterborne or occur in close proximity on water resources, interventions such as primary education in health and water, an increase in ecologically sustainable food production or the implementation of suitable water purification systems might help to overcome pressing health problems as well as to maintain the ecological character of wetlands (RCW, 2012). Although development projects such as these focus on ecosystems and biodiversity, they nevertheless rely heavily on the recognition of human practices and the way they contribute to the shaping of landscapes, water resources and agriculture.",

But, in thinking about contemporary human\u2013animal encounters, it may be suggestive to situate them in wider natural\u2013cultural borderlands. That is, seen from the perspective of cultural anthropology, research should question the actual scope, contradictions, effects, and reflections of microbial globalization processes. By applying ethnographic research methods \u2013 often including participant observations and in-depth interviews as well as providing a comparative perspective \u2013 anthropological approaches are sensitive to everyday practices and the numerous cultural, social, technological, political, and economical contexts within which these practices are enacted. These approaches contest traditional biomedical models accounting for disease emergence and transmission and focus instead on how biomedical knowledge is constructed to evaluate its standards and technologies. One of the most important features of anthropological theory is its recognition of context: in this line of inquiry, biology is no longer considered essentially universal just as culture is now believed to be an integral part of diseases, bodies, and biologies. Whereas the notion of \u201cone health\u201d is built upon the assumption of a shared biological destiny, the anthropological perspective might provide useful insights into the wide range of diverging practices, institutions, norms, and bodies that contribute to microbial globalization processes and their governance.",

Epidemiological research on the demographics of malaria movement (Pindolia et al., 2013) or antimicrobial drug resistance (MacPherson et al., 2009) bears witness to the fact that human activities \u2013 such as interregional migration, waste management or the use of bed nets \u2013 have to be integrated into the modeling of infectious disease dynamics in order to fully assess emerging public health risks. Given the case of drug resistant malaria strains, for example, the implementation of successful intervention strategies depends strongly on the identification of transmission patterns, demographic groupings and migratory routines.

While there is no general agreement among social scientists about the meaning, definition, or the consequences of globalization, it is nevertheless of great concern for many of them. It is in this context that Stephen Collier and Aihwa Ong (2005) identify three distinctive approaches to the transformation processes commonly associated with globalization: a tendency to conceptualize a \u201cnew order of things\u201d (depicted, for example, as modernization or network society); the examination of local articulations of global forces; and finally the revision of some of our discipline's fundamental analytical categories such as \u201cculture\u201d or \u201cscape\u201d (p. 3). Ong and Collier, however, do not focus on structural transformations as such but they suggest analyzing the shifting forms of global phenomena as they are articulated in specific domains through which \u201cthe forms and values of individual and collective existence are problematized or at stake, in the sense that they are subject to technological, political, and ethical reflection and intervention\u201d (p. 4). The authors draw on Sarah Franklin's (2005) ethnographic study on the refiguring of traditional notions of governance, biology, and economy in the emergence of a \u201cglobal\u201d stem cell industry, to illustrate how a new form of humanism is brought about, which no longer claims to relate to a certain culture or social group but to humanity and to human life as such. They are keen to emphasize \u2013 which is useful for our purposes here \u2013 that the actual scope of emerging forms of humanism is not necessarily all-encompassing but is commonly articulated within and closely connected to a particular political and technological setting. A careful observation of those processes that are characterized by instability, contingency and conflict might be useful for understanding how notions of global responsibility, global scope or \u201cone health\u201d are invoked within such settings as the implementation of surveillance systems, the marketing and distribution of drugs, or the debates on the property rights over a new virus, as the current example of MERS, the middle east respiratory syndrome, illustrates.",

            "text": "The global (and local) dimensions of cultural practices, norms, and artifacts, lately often discussed as assemblematic or shifting in form, have for a long time held a strong interest for anthropologists working on global health issues. Accordingly, the transnational mobility of risks, body parts, or biomedical standards is one of the most prominent areas of current medical anthropological research (see, for example, Inhorn, 2003, Scheper-Hughes, 2005, Song, 2010, Waldby and Mitchell, 2007). Thus a number of questions arise in this context: how are technological innovations adapted to local contexts? How do they merge with traditional health behaviors? How are certain diseases conceptualized and treated within different communities? Why do diseases and bodies differ from context to context? Each of the previous questions are well established research questions in fields like medical anthropology, and they provide a rich area of ethnographic research: in his empirical study of dengue control programs in Nicaragua, for example, medical anthropologist Alex Nading (2012) explores why local anti-dengue campaigns \u2013 which advertise a participatory approach by integrating female community workers (brigadistas) into the management of urban mosquito populations \u2013 do not seem to solve the problem, in spite of rigorous education campaigns. These campaigns promote the vision of disciplined households where insects and humans are strictly kept apart, and they shift responsibilities to the female member of these households. Nading joined several teams of local brigadistas during their collective encounter, namely the hunt for hidden mosquito breeding sites such as bottle caps, flowerpots or coconut shells. He discovered not only the intimate pleasure of hunting, but also profound discrepancies between scientific attempts of separating insects from humans and the brigadistas' notion to accept their environment as a place of multiple interspecies encounters. Nading's empirical findings stress the close material-semiotic entanglements between women and mosquitoes, both being depicted as \u201cunsanitary\u201d and \u201cundisciplined\u201d by public health strategies. The author suggests as well, that mosquito intervention campaigns might address the wrong participants: instead of integrating adult women, children would be ideal candidates, claims Nading, as the playfulness of the mosquito hunt and its close relation to urban nature poses an ideal area of activity for children. Consequently, as this study illuminates, the call for more rigorous advertisement campaigns and \u201cmore science\u201d is doomed to failure. Other anthropological studies illustrate the tensions between local food practices and infectious disease control programs (Lockerbie and Herring, 2009), scrutinize the impact of Malaria eradication programs on mosquito behavior in the streets of Dar es Salaam (Kelly and Beisel, 2011) or focus on the diverging functions of domestic animals and their role in the transmission of infectious diseases such as Echinococcosis (Fuller and Fuller, 1981), often presenting critical and surprising clues for understanding complex infectious disease ecologies and potential control of them. It is against this backdrop that scholars, like anthropologist Cecil G. Helman (2007), depict the very nature of global health strategies as paradoxical and fraught with tension. While the spread of emerging infections, for example, requires health strategies that are global in scale, it is likewise impossible \u2013 given the diversity of local social worlds \u2013 to develop universal strategies that can be neatly adapted to any local context (p. 451).",

While her observation that biological entities do not organize themselves within well-bounded populations is in line with much of the one health approach, she also scrutinizes the underlying notion of the global scale of pandemics. Lowe argues that the framing of the newly emerging H5N1-epidemic as global must not only be understood as a construction but that it also shifted responsibilities from an issue in Indonesian national public health to international intervention initiatives, thereby blaming the native human and chicken populations for posing a threat to mankind worldwide and causing a massive poultry cull. Similar to literary theorist Priscilla Wald (2008), Lowe makes use of the concept of narrative to underline that the idea of a truly egalitarian threat only masks the fact that the assumed dynamics of the coming pandemic relies on a differentiation between \u201cthere\u201d (Southeast Asia) and \u201chere\u201d (North America and Europe) and thereby articulates fears about a potentially deadly virus being brought to Western industrialized countries.",

Drawing on the concept of the microbiome, they argue for the integration of interconnected and diverse microbiological perspectives in order to reconceptualize traditional notions of \u201clife\u201d or the body. The concept of the microbiome has recently drawn attention to the contribution of microorganisms to the health and physiology of the human body. As multi-species scholars and natural scientists similarly stress, human organs, such as the skin or the intestines, depend on host\u2013bacterial mutualisms that are beneficial to both humans and their microbial partners. B\u00e4ckhed et al. (2005), for example, picture the gut microbiota as an organ placed within the host's organ: \u201cIt is composed of different cell lineages with a capacity to communicate with one another and the host; it consumes, stores, and redistributes energy; it mediates physiologically important chemical transformations; and it can maintain and repair itself through self-replication. The gut microbiome, which may contain \u2265100 times the number of genes in our genome, endows us with functional features that we have not had to evolve ourselves\u201d (p. 1915). The average human person nowadays is believed to harbor around 160 different species of gut microbiota (Hughes, 2012).",

            "text": "What is interesting about this perspective \u2013 in the context of attempts to study the social determinants of health \u2013 is that it allows us to rethink alliances and couplings between humans, microbes, and environments on both the biological and the social level: the genomic constitution and age of individuals, for example, might be as important as food practices, sexual preferences or consumption patterns. Hence, the microbial communities in our bodies are constantly subject to change, depending \u2013 among other factors \u2013 on age, diet, and environment and hereby are inherently linked to human health. In her ethnographic study on the making of raw-milk cheese in the United States, anthropologist Heather Paxson (2008) makes clear that it is worth investing in the potentialities of human and microbial practices which she understands as cultural and collaborative. She describes how farmers and artisan cheese makers are coupled with the materiality of their specific local soils (the terroir) through milk and cheese consumption, flavor components, and digestive processes, and she suggests that the natural\u2013cultural human\u2013microbial entanglements are the ongoing outcome and not the raw material of history and thereby always in a process of formation. What is interesting about her research, for our purposes here, is that it illustrates how the relationship between humans \u2013 farmers and cheese makers \u2013 and nonhumans \u2013 bacteria and milk cattle \u2013 is created and modified by cultural practices such as the pasteurization of milk, the feeding of cattle, the use of soap and towels, milking techniques or practices of food preparation. Taking this embeddedness of the human body seriously, particularly by blending biological dynamics, environmental effects and social practice analytically, might help to overcome simplistic \u201cculturalistic\u201d cause\u2013effect relationships and the development of a thorough understanding of human embodiment within distinct historical and spatial contexts and infectious disease ecologies (Lock, 2012, p. 129). In other words, a critical ethnographically informed exploration of \u2013 often unquestioned \u2013 concepts such as \u201cbody\u201d or \u201cglobal\u201d provides an important window into the complexity of the social determinants of health. As Marcia Inhorn and Peter Brown (2009) claim:It is important to note that infection with a specific agent does not necessarily result in disease. This progression depends upon a number of intervening variables, including the pathogenicity of the agent, the route of transmission of the agent to the host, and the nature and strength of the host's response. All of these factors, in turn, are affected by the natural and social environments in which the agent and host are juxtaposed; in some cases, the environment may promote the transmission of the agent to the host, while in other cases it may limit or even prevent such transmission. Critical characteristics of the environment result largely from socio-political influences; thus, many infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, are rightly considered \u2018social diseases\u2019 (p. 33).\n",

            "text": "Based upon the theoretical assumptions on globalization and the human body sketched above, serious questions remain, however, on the numerous couplings of human health with a more than human world, on the embodiment of infectious disease, on diverging explanatory approaches, on the construction and transgression of interspecies boundaries \u2013 questions that anthropology might address to the benefit of one health-approaches: Natalie Porter's (2012) study on avian flu management in Vietnam, for example, shows how boundaries between different species are constructed, enacted, and transgressed, and how this process re-organizes the spatial and social relations between poultry, humans, and viruses, illustrating the limits of place-based approaches in the management of zoonotic diseases. Paul Farmer's (1997) insightful account of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in Haiti sheds lights on the embodiment of TB, as he presents the bacterium as contingent of social forces (\u201cranging from racism to political violence,\u201d p. 356). Stressing the social determinants of MDR TB, Farmer makes clear that poor housing conditions, economic inequalities and violence have an impact on the materiality of human\u2013pathogen-interactions within the body which enable the TB bacterium to accumulate resistant mutations, witnessing the multiple ways biology is situated in time and space. Uli Beisel's and Christophe Bo\u00ebte's (2013) account of genetically modified mosquitoes as an instrument for malaria control describes how insects are transformed from a potentially dangerous vector into a potentially beneficial tool, shifting attention \u201caway from public health personnel or the people affected by the disease, instead it is centered on the body of the mosquito itself\u201d (p. 55). Ethnographic approaches such as these can provide useful information on how people in different geographical regions determine whether an agent is a pathogen, on how differences in the enactment of interspecies boundaries relate to patterns of disease transmission or how social activities of humans impact the emergence and spread of microbes. While the above mentioned examples are by no means exhaustive, they might prove to be helpful in reevaluating the larger field of complex disease ecologies and their social determinants.",

But, as I hope to have made clear in this article, with health being our object of inquiry, another set of factors \u2013 apart from the biological ones \u2013 is becoming increasingly important: namely the social determinants of human\u2013animal-disease-interactions (the WHO for example integrated the social determinants of health into one of their strategic programs; see WHO, 2010b). As biocultural phenomena, health care practices and the human body have to be situated into the numerous cultural, social, technological, political, and economical contexts within which these practices are enacted. By recognizing infectious disease ecologies as a product of social relations, it becomes apparent that in order to understand the scope and impact of these relations, we cannot rely on any given assumptions about the constitution of human health, the human body, or the constitution of \u201cthe global\u201d as such. In fact, adding a social science perspective to one health approaches might help to study human\u2013animal behavior, food practices, health beliefs, barriers, conflicts and environmental interactions on a much grander scale than ever before. But on the other hand, a greater sensitivity to context may also give rise to doubts about the idea of \u201cone health\u201d \u2013 not in spite of the complex disease interactions between microbes, domesticated animals and wildlife, humans and their environments, but because of them.",
