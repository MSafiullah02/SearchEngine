Even though lopinavir-ritonavir might not be efficacious in cases of severe COVID-19, we postulate that similar treatments to these antivirals, which also effectively inhibit viral replication, will be more effective in preventing disease progression if used to treat mild disease than if used to treat severe disease. We encourage randomised trials to assess antiviral drugs for the treatment of mild COVID-19.",

For example, oseltamivir has shown benefits over placebo in patients with influenza if administered less than 48 h after the onset of symptoms. By contrast, administration of this influenza neuraminidase inhibitor more than 48 h after symptom onset showed no significant benefit over placebo. Likewise, baloxavir, which targets the cap-dependent endonuclease, was more effective when given to patients with influenza within 24 h of symptom onset than when given to patients after 24 h of symptom onset.2\n",

Moreover, an analysis of COVID-19 symptom progression indicated that hospitalisation occurs a mean of 5 days after symptom onset, and deterioration to a severe status might occur more than 5 days after symptom onset. Therefore, there is a potential treatment window in which intervention could prevent the progression of disease. Conversely, critically ill patients can show signs of an exuberant inflammatory response,4 which might not depend on viral replication once initiated. Since severe manifestations of COVID-19, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, often manifest many days after symptom onset, treatments that are highly effective in controlling viral replication could nonetheless show modest or no benefits in treating severe disease.",

Such an indication, if proven, could reduce requirements for admission to hospital and intensive care units and provide benefit to a large number of people, especially in resource-limited settings, where hospital capacity is already limited and might therefore be unavailable to patients with severe illness. One modelling study5 suggested that a therapy that reduces progression to critical disease could reduce the need for physical distancing and hasten the development of herd immunity, thereby achieving the same benefits as increased intensive care unit capacity, while preventing more critical cases.",
