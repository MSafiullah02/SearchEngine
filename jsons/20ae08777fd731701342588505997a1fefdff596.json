While a lower case fatality rate may also be attributed to inherent viral 129 characteristics, other contributing factors may include the improvement of health care services 130 and protective equipment, and other significant protective measures taken worldwide. 131 In summary, the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak teaches us that health care workers are at high-risk 132 and that PPEs and their proper utilization is essential. It is concerning that the current 133 pandemic may reemerge next winter and that recovery of health care services may take several 134 years or longer. 135 136 Review of the National and Regional Guidelines 137 By the time that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic 138 on March 11 th , it was apparent that the virus would place substantial strain on health care 139 infrastructure and supplies throughout the country in the following days and weeks. 15 To meet 140 these challenges, on March 13 th the American College of Surgeons (ACS) put forth the first 141 recommendations on elective care during this crisis. They recommended each surgeon to 142 \"thoughtfully review all scheduled elective procedures with a plan to minimize, postpone, or 143 cancel electively scheduled operations.\" They also stated this recommendation be in place until 144 we have passed the anticipated inflection point of virus exposure and can reliably support a 145 rapid uptick in patient critical care needs. 16 This statement was quickly supported by the US 146 Surgeon General and followed-up by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), who 147 provided a tiered framework when considering elective medical services. 17, 18 The three tiers, 148which are based upon acuity, guide which procedures are appropriate to be conducted at this 149 time and which should be postponed. In general, they recommended surgeons to limit all non-150 essential planned surgeries until further notice. 17 Notably, initial recommendations were 151 considered in the context of a global crisis and did not contemplate differences in local or",
