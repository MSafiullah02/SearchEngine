We previously analyzed Rns sequences from 18 isolates from morphological groups 2 and 3 and found that they fell into four distinct evolutionary lineages we called sequence types TILT4. Here, we analyzed sequences from 53 isolates representing 16 species and including 35 new strains. Eight additional lineages (sequence types TS-TI 2) were identified. Four of the I2 sequence types included strains from more than one nominal species. Thus, sequence types could be equated with species in some cases or with complexes of closely related species in others. The largest complex, sequence type T4, which contained six closely related nominal species, included 24 of 25 keratitis isolates. Rns sequence variation was insufficient for full phylogenetic resolution of branching orders within this complex, but the mixing of species observed at terminal nodes confirmed that traditional classification of isolates has been inconsistent. One solution to this problem would be to equate sequence types and single species. Alternatively, additional molecular information will be required to reliably differentiate species within the complexes. Three sequence types of morphological group I species represented the earliest divergence in the history of the genus and, based on their genetic distinctiveness, are candidates for reclassification as one or more novel genera.",

Group 1 species have large cysts compared to the other groups, with a smooth ectocyst and a stellate endocyst. Group 2 species have a wrinkled ectocyst and the endocyst can be stellate, polygonal, triangular, or oval. Group 3 species typically have a thin, smooth ectocyst with a round endocyst. However, Sawyer first observed that ionic strength of the growth medium can alter the shape of cyst walls [27] , thus, substantially reducing the reliability of cyst morphology as a taxonomic characteristic. Pussard and Pons (261 used the number of ostioles in the cysts as defining characters, but this character has been mentioned infrequently in subsequent descriptions of species.",

Moura, Wallace and Visvesvara [22] found good agreement between isoenzyme patterns and morphological groups, but their study was limited and included only one group 2 isolate, A. castellanii Castellmi. De Jonckheere [8], Daggett et al. [ 7 ] , and Costas and Griffiths [6] , studied larger groups of isolates including 30, 71 and 37 strains, respectively.

Our lab recently began an investigation of 18s rRNA gene (Rns) phylogeny using 18 isolates of Acanthamoeba from morphological groups 2 and 3 [12] . These groups were chosen because they contain species most frequently isolated from human infections. The amount of sequence dissimilarity among the 18 isolates ranged from 0-11.9% and the various isolates subdivided into four rDNA sequence types. Fifteen of the isolates formed a tight phylogenetic cluster designated sequence type T4. The remaining three isolates each had sequences that were very distinct from the major group and, thus, were placed in sequence types Tl-T3.",

Nucleotide sequences were aligned with the assistance of the program ESEE (Eyeball Sequence Editor) [5] after identifying homologous positions on the basis of secondary structure [14, 241. One master alignment was made and used for all further comparisons and phylogenetic reconstructions. The 18s rRNA genes of Acanthamoeba are approximately 2,300-2,700 bp in length. However, ten isolates from two different species contained group 1 introns [ 1 1 ; JMS-D et al., unpubl. data]. Intron sequences were not included in our analyses. Percent nucleotide similarities were calculated using all sites of the 18s rRNA gene. Large insertion or deletion events were treated as multiple sites rather than as single sites in the calculation. The percent similarity corresponds to the number of sites that are identical between two isolates, aligned to each other as in the master alignment, divided by the total number of sites compared after common gaps have been removed. Alignments are available at our Web site, www.bio-sci.ohio-state.edu/-pfuerst/!acanth.htm, or from DRS, RJG, TJB or PAE Phylogenetic analysis. Introns, regions of ambiguous alignment and regions specified by PCR primers SSUl and SSU2 were removed from the master alignment so that only homologous sites were compared. As a result, the phylogenetic analysis included 1,863 sites. Once aligned, nucleotide sequences were compared and a distance matrix, which is available at our Web site or upon request, was generated using DNADIST in the PHYLIP package (Ver. 3.5) [9] . Phylogenetic inferences were made using neighbor-joining (NEIGHBOR) with the Kimura two-parameter correction for multiple substitutions as implemented in PHYLIP The data also were examined using the maximum parsimony program DNAPARS and the maximum likelihood program DNAML in PHYLIP. Bootstrap analyses were done by generating 1,000 datasets at random using SE-QBOOT. Consensus neighbor-joining and consensus parsimony trees were generated from bootstrapped datasets and bootstrap values were obtained. All analyses were performed on an IRIX Indigo (Silicon Graphics, Inc.) workstation.",

The individual ladders could be resolved by sequencing cloned PCR products as demonstrated for isolate GE3a ( Fig. 2A, C) . The presence of several alleles in a PCR product could have three explanations: 1) Taq polymerase errors; 2) the presence of genetically different strains in the amoeba culture, or 3) the presence of several different alleles in individual amoebae. The multiple alleles are unlikely to be due to Taq polymerase errors. The numbers of differences between alleles in H30, the most carefully studied strain, were 1-4 bp per 1,000, whereas, our error rate for sequences from strains with only one Rns allele consistently was 0.5-1 bp per 1,000 [12] . The allele-specific differences within a strain were observed with several different primer sets and multiple PCR reactions. Strains 88-2-37 and H30 share one identical allele, but, whereas, only one allele was found in 88-2-37, two other alleles were found in H30. It is unlikely in this case that Taq repeatedly would make the same allele-specific mistakes in the DNA of one strain and not the other. Also, allele-specific insertioddeletion events were found in some strains with multiple alleles in addition to the point mutations that are characteristic of Taq errors. Thus, we conclude that the allelic differences are not due to Taq errors. The possibility that the presence of multiple alleles in H30 was due to PCR amplification from cultures that were mixtures of strains was ruled out by PCR amplifying from cloned amoeba cultures. The same three alleles were found in each of the cloned cultures. Thus, we conclude that individual amoebae can have more than one Rns allele.",

The rationale for reclassification of strains 1501/3c, Diamond and V006 has been discussed above. The Panola Mt. strain should be reclassified because it has a T3 sequence type, whereas, the majority of A. polyphaga strains are T4. The Panola Mt. sequence is only 0.9% dissimilar from S7, the type strain for A. grifini, and, thus, should be reclassified as this species. De Jonckheere [8] described a close relationship between A. pustulosa and A. palestinensis based on isozyme comparisons and suggested the possibility that A. pustulosa is an invalid synonym for A. palestinensis. Our results support that conclusion. His study also led to the reclassification of A. lenticulata 2802 to A. palestinensis 2802. The Rns phylogeny agrees that 2802 (T6) is not likely to be A. lenticulata (TS); its Rns sequence is 19.1-19.3% dissimilar from those of that species ( Table 2 ). The Rns phylogeny also agrees that 2802 is most closely related to the T2 strains including A. palestinensis Reich (5.2-5.9% dissimilar). We have placed it in a separate sequence type because its dissimilarity from T2 sequences exceeds that found so far for dif- ferences within other sequence types. Nevertheless, the two sequence types are relatively closely related and we see no compelling reason to rename this isolate at this time.",

Prior molecular studies as well as the studies we have done here indicate that there are numerous inconsistencies between the classification of strains and the evolutionary lineages. Our analyses have helped to more accurately identify lineages within the three morphological groups, but they have not succeeded in clarifying evolutionary relationships among the closely related strains that are included within a single sequence type. We attempted to identify branching patterns of lineages within sequence type T4 and failed. Twenty five isolates from six species are clustered in T4. The isolates are closely related with maximum nucleotide dissimilarities of 4.4% and evolutionary distances less than 0.44%. A subcluster analysis including T4 examined an additional 227 sites that were in regions of ambiguity in the full alignment. However, this analysis still did not further resolve relationships among the several species and they remained intermixed (Fig. 4) . One clade of seven strains that has a neighbor-joining bootstrap value of 79% (Fig. 4) might be used as the basis for one species. At present, however, this clade has isolates from three different species. It remains t o be seen whether other molecular methods such as isozyme electrophoresis, mitochondria1 DNA RFLPs, or sequences of other genes will be helpful in reliably identifying other significant clades within T4. Unfortunately, at present we are unable to evaluate which method has the most promise for further resolving Acanthamoeba phylogeny because there is too little overlap between the strains used in our work and those used by others. Alternatively, it may be impossible with available methods to resolve the branching patterns within sequence types. In that case, we propose that each sequence type should be equated with a single species. For example, the various species in T4 all might be reclassified as A. castellanii, because the sequence type includes the type strain for that species [12] .",

In order for Rns sequences to be widely useful in the classification of Acanthamoeba, practical methods for determining sequence types are needed. A number of laboratories will have the capability of sequencing Rns from new isolates. The new sequences can be compared with those that we have donated to GenB-[ l ] and our master alignments which are available at our Web site or upon request. The alignments also can be used for development of alternative methods for identifying sequence types. For example, we previously described a slot blot method for identifying Acanthamoeba by hybridizing genus-or subgenus-specific oligonucleotide probes with genomic DNA [ 101. We now have improved methods using PCR with slot blotting, sequencing of a short diagnostic fragment, or in situ hybridization using oligonucleotides with nonradioactive labels [DRS, JMS-D, unpubl. data]. We have developed methods that are genus-specific and T4-specific. Detection of T4 isolates was emphasized because they appear to be very abundant and the dominant sequence type in association with disease, but the techniques could be used to develop methods specific for other sequence types for clinical or biodiversity studies.",
