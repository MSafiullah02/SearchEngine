The 180 or so delegates came from countries that covered nearly the entire globe. The papers, and the discussions following them, clearly reemphasized that, in spite of much progress in the past few decades, nosocomial infections remain a serious threat to human health worldwide. Indeed, many on-going changes in our societies, wide-spread drug resistance and immunosuppression, greater international trade in livestock and comestibles, faster and more frequent air travel as well as general reductions in health care funding have considerably enhanced the risk from nosocomial infections in our times. The information presented covered the highly relevant and topical issues of environmental surface disinfection,1 hand hygiene,2., 3., 4., 5. reprocessing of medical devices,6., 7., 8., 9., 10. surveillance of nosocomial infections11 and the role of viruses as nosocomial pathogens.12., 13., 14.\n",

While this study makes a case for the use of sporicidal chemicals in the disinfection of hospital floors, we need further studies to determine the benefit: hazard ratio of the wide-spread use of sporicides, many of which can be unsafe. The contact time for sporicidal activity under ambient conditions would also require a substantial reduction to make routine application of sporicides on hospital floors practicable.",

Boyce and Pittet, the two co-authors of the CDC guideline, gave the scientific basis and global implications of its recommendations. This document has already had a substantial impact on the practices of hand hygiene in the U.S., particularly by catalyzing the acceptance of alcohol-based hand rubs in healthcare settings.",
