Fundamentally, when it comes to the immune system health of production and companion animals, there are little absolute differences in the intended purpose of the immune system. Mammals have the same basic immune system with minor differences between the species. Even the differences between birds and mammals are not so great since the purpose of the immune system is to keep infectious microorganisms, such as certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi, out of the body and to destroy any infectious microorganisms that do invade the body. How veterinarians take advantage of the immune system to maintain health can roughly be defined as taking advantage of the body\u2019s inherent method of maintaining health through adaptive immunity provided by vaccinations to generate antibodies inside the animal or by administering preformed antibodies to an animal through a process called passive immunity.",

This system has two broad categories: nonadaptive and adaptive. The nonadaptive immune system is mediated by cells that respond in a nonspecific manner to foreign substances. This response includes phagocytosis by macrophages, secretion of lysozymes by lacrimal cells, and cell lysis by natural killer cells. The adaptive immune response is mediated by lymphocytes that produce a set of proteins called antibodies that are either secreted by or found on the surface of the lymphocyte. When the antibodies themselves are created within the animal following vaccination or from exposure to pathogens, the process is called adaptive immunity. When preformed antibodies from a host animal are given to another recipient animal, such as it offspring or even a completely different species animal, the process is called passive immunity.",

These diverse aims have led to different approaches in the development of veterinary vaccines from crude but effective whole-pathogen preparations to molecularly defined subunit vaccines, genetically engineered organisms or chimeras, vectored antigen formulations, and naked DNA injections (Meeusen et al. 2007). It has also resulted in various guidelines for vaccinations of companion animals such as for dogs (Ford et al. 2017) and production animals such as swine (Alabama and Auburn 2018), in poultry (Stewart-Brown 2018), cow/calf (Missouri 2018), and other production animals. Successful veterinary vaccines have been produced against viral, bacterial, protozoal, and multicellular pathogens, which in many ways have led the field in the application and adaptation of novel technologies.",

Passive immunity provides only short-lived protection, lasting from several weeks to up to 3\u20134 months, but is immediate. Nature intended passive immunity to occur when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta or from breast milk to the gut of the infant. However, it can also be produced artificially when antibody preparations are derived from sera or secretions of immunized donors and are delivered via oral or systemic routes to nonimmune individuals. Passive immunization is a new approach to providing protection to animals against pathogens because of the emergence of new and drug-resistant microorganisms, diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy and individuals with an impaired immune system who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines.",

The spleen, where plasma cells responsible for antibody production reside, is the major site of specific IgM production (Capolunghi et al. 2013; Marchalonis et al. 2002). IgG is the main type of antibody found in blood and extracellular fluid allowing it to control infection within body tissues. Approximately 80% of all antibodies in humans and companion animals are of the IgG class. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays a crucial role in the immune function of mucous membranes. The amount of IgA produced in association with mucosal membranes is greater than all other types of antibodies combined (Fagarasan and Honjo 2003; Holmgren and Czerkinsky 2005; Snoeck et al. 2006). IgD was initially thought to be a recently evolved antibody class because it was only detected in primates, mice, rats, and dogs and not guinea pigs, swine, cattle, sheep, and frogs (Preud\u2019homme et al. 2000). However, recent discoveries of IgD in ancient vertebrates suggest that IgD has been preserved in evolution from fish to humans for important immunological functions (Chen and Cerutt 2011). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) has only been identified in mammals. IgE\u2019s main function is immunity against parasites such as helminths (Erb 2007) like Schistosoma mansoni, Trichinella spiralis, and Fasciola hepatica (Watanabe et al. 2005; Pfister et al. 1983). IgE also has an essential role in type I hypersensitivity (Gould et al. 2003) which manifests in various allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, most types of sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and specific types of chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis (Mueller et al. 2016).",

When a mammal is born, it emerges from the sterile uterus into an environment where it is immediately exposed to a host of microorganisms. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) acquires a complex microbial flora within hours. If it is to survive, the newborn animal must be able to control this microbial invasion. In practice, the adaptive immune system takes some time to become fully functional, and innate mechanisms are responsible for the initial resistance to infection. In some species with a short gestation period, such as mice, the adaptive immune system may not even be fully developed at birth. In animals with a long gestation period, such as domestic mammals, the adaptive immune system is fully developed at birth but cannot function at adult levels for several weeks. The complete development of active immunity depends on antigenic stimulation. The proper development of B cells and B-cell receptor diversity requires clonal selection and antigen-driven cell multiplication. Thus, newborn mammals are vulnerable to infection for the first few weeks of life. They need assistance in defending themselves at this juncture. Temporary help is provided by the mother in the form of colostrum, which contains antibodies. The passive transfer of immunity from mother to newborn is essential for survival.",

While humans have a large amount of IgA in their colostrum, the colostrum from most other animals contains a high percentage of IgG (Hurley and Theil 2011) (Fig. 4). Immunoglobulins found in mammary secretions arise from systemic and local sources. In the case of IgG in milk, the major portion comes from the serum (Mayer et al. 2005).

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the major immunoglobulin in human colostrum and milk; however, it is also present in milk of most other species. Colostrum and milk IgA and IgM are found in the form of secretory IgA, or sIgA, and sIgM. Much of this is produced by plasma cells in the mammary tissue. The plasma cells are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), the largest immune organ of an organism, which includes the Peyer\u2019s patches, lymphoid and myeloid cells in the lamina propria, and intraepithelial lymphocytes (Ishikawa et al. 2005). Interestingly enough, more than 70% of the immune system is located in the gastro intestinal tract, the site where many oral pathogens first interact with an animal (Vighi et al. 2008). GALT is a part of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and works in the immune system to protect animals from invasion of pathogens in the gut. One of the physiological functions of the mucosa in the gut is for food absorption. However, of equal importance of the GALT is in the body\u2019s defense, due to its large population of plasma cells whose number exceeds the number of plasma cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow combined (Nagler-Anderson 2001).",

Some of the immunoglobulins also remain in the gut where they can neutralize pathogenic bacteria and help prevent the development of diarrhea. The absorption of antibodies from the GIT into the bloodstream is called passive transfer. Failure of passive transfer (FPT) in dairy calves is defined by a blood IgG level of <10 mg/mL 24\u201348 h after birth (Stilwell and Carvalho 2011). Calves that experience FPT are more likely to become sick or die in the first 2 months of life than calves with adequate immunity. Many factors can contribute to FPT, but colostrum and the management of colostrum feeding are often involved. To successfully obtain passive transfer and provide the calf with protection from diseases, it is thought that the calf needs to consume a minimum of 150\u2013200 g of immunoglobulins (Meganck et al. 2014).",

One of the leading causes of death in dairy calves is failure to initiate breathing and metabolic processes in the first hours of life.

Generally speaking, quality of colostrum is related to the amount of antibody that is present. Colostral IgG concentration is an important factor that affects whether calves receive sufficient passive immunity (Godden et al. 2012). Unfortunately, the amount of IgG in maternal colostrum varies dramatically among cows (< 1\u2013235 g/l) with 29.4\u201357.8% of samples that do not reach the desired amount of 50 g IgG/l (Gulliksen et al. 2008). Colostral quality is difficult to estimate by the farmer based on produced volume or appearance of the colostrum. There are many variables that impact colostrum quality, including nutrition, the time the cow is milked, heat stress, and stage of lactation. A study from Iowa State University suggests that a minimum 30% of dairy calves in the USA are currently being fed colostrum classified below industry standards for IgG content and are at a greater risk of FPT, mortality, and morbidity (Morrill et al. 2011).",

However, colostrum supplement and replacer products can be valuable tools to increase calf immunity when colostrum supplies are limited or disease eradication is desired. Colostrum products that contain IgG are regulated by the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics and are available in bolus, gel, and powder formats. Supplement products are unable to raise the blood concentration of IgG above the species standard, which is 10 mg/mL for calves. Any product that is able to raise serum IgG concentration above 10 mg/mL may be called a colostrum replacer (Penn State 2017).

Bovine colostrum that is typically spray-dried for supplements or replacer will contain only the antibodies that the cow may have encountered naturally. Therefore, the colostrum used may not have specific antibodies against particular diseases that a producer might be interested in. The animal industry has recognized this issue and has developed methods to produce specific antibodies in high titer against specific diseases that can be delivered in colostrum products. This is achieved by hyperimmunizing animals such as cows against specific animal diseases, collecting colostrum and processing it into powders such as by freeze-drying methods and then giving to a newborn animal in gels or boluses. A number of diseases including bacterial diseases like E. coli (Selim et al. 1995) and viral diseases such as rotavirus and coronavirus (Combs et al. 1993) or coccidial diseases such as giardia or cryptosporidia (Graczyk et al. 1999; Fayer et al. 1989; Naciri et al. 1994) have been researched for hyperimmunized colostrum efficacy.

The activation of B- and T-cell memory responses in calves vaccinated IFOMA varies and is affected by several factors, including age, level of maternal immunity, type of vaccine, and route of administration. These factors influence the adequate priming of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and the outcome of vaccination.

On the other hand, while maternal antibodies can block response to vaccination, sometimes they do not (Woolums 2007). The exact immunologic outcome in calves vaccinated IFOMA can vary, and this variation likely depends on many factors. These factors are not well characterized but likely include the nature of the vaccine administered, number of doses administered, age of the calf and level of maternal antibody present in the calf, and the means by which a protective response is defined.

These antibodies go to the gut to immediately bind and neutralize diarrhea antigens while also being absorbed into the blood stream for extended protection (Combs et al. 1993; Chamorro et al. 2014).

This may not be surprising since mammals have a considerably longer time of weeks or months during which they may passively transfer immunoglobulin and immune factors, while the hen has a single opportunity (the egg) to transfer all necessary survival components to its offspring. All the aspects that the chick needs to survive must be in the egg. Because egg products are a common source of protein in human diets and eggs contain antibodies and immune factors, it was obvious to utilize egg antibodies to provide passive immunity to animals. As such, this has resulted in a number of commercial egg antibody products on the market for production animals as well as companion animals to prevent various diseases. With few exceptions, oral consumption of specific antibodies has been reported (Diraviyam et al. 2014) to protect both humans and animals. Furthermore, in vitro studies with specific IgY antibodies have been found to inhibit processes associated with bacterial growth, adhesion to intestinal cells, and toxin production (Sugita-Konishi et al. 1996).",

For example, bacteria E. coli strain K88 typically causes problems in production animals that result in diarrhea and possible death. Therefore, a vaccination program is used in chickens to create specific anti-E. coli K88 IgY antibodies. These specific antibodies found in the yolk of the egg are given orally to animals to prevent E. coli K88 from causing disease. This occurs when specific anti-E. coli K88 IgY antibodies bind to the pathogenic bacteria. This binding blocks the ability of the pathogen to bind to the mucin layer in the GI tract of the animal. The pathogens are flushed out of the GI tract with the feces since they have been rendered unable to bind.",

Additionally, both the table egg and the \u201cimmune\u201d egg contain immunoregulatory factors, but eggs from hyperimmunized chickens may contain many times greater concentrations of individual factors as compared to regular eggs. Besides immunoglobulins, eggs contain a number of bioactive components, including phospholipids, cholesterol, lutein, zeaxanthin, and proteins, that possess a variety of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory properties. Two major categories of immune components are found in \u201chyperimmune\u201d egg: (1) the immunoglobulins with neutralizing specificities against the stimulating pathogens and (2) the immunoregulatory factors that modulate cellular functions. The immunoglobulins provide local protection against gastrointestinal intoxication. The immunomodulatory mediators act directly on gastrointestinal surfaces and circulate systemically, affecting every immune, physical, metabolic, and neuroendocrine pathway in the body. These may have important implications for the pathophysiology of numerous chronic diseases and immune responses to acute injury (Andersen 2015). Given the essentiality of pro-inflammatory responses in normal immune defense against pathogens, further research into the role of egg intake on immunity is warranted and may lead to further commercial uses of eggs and IgY technology.",

While these particular mAbs were not commercially successful, they are part of a new approach for using therapeutic antibodies in veterinary medicine. Other companies are developing veterinary mAbs for cancer, allergies, and chronic inflammatory disease such as atopic dermatitis and for the control of pain associated with osteoarthritis in dogs and cats (Webster et al. 2014). The first mAb approved for veterinary use was in the European Union (BMJ 2017). It treats the clinical signs of atopic dermatitis in dogs, including itch and inflammation, for up to 1 month. The mAb treatment works by mimicking the activity of natural antibodies to selectively bind to and neutralize interleukin-31 (IL-31), a key protein involved in cell communication which triggers itching associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs. Because it neutralizes IL-31, it has been demonstrated not to interfere with the immune response, meaning that it does not induce unintended immunosuppression or enhancement.",

As a result, there are few anticipated side effects and reactions although they can occur (Catapanoab and Papadopoulosc 2013). mAbs are eventually eliminated via intracellular catabolism in the lysosome, where they are broken down into peptides or amino acids that can be either reused for synthesis of new proteins or excreted via the urine.",

However, due to the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 1928, and the subsequent introduction of the much cheaper and safer antibiotics in the 1930s, serum therapy was largely abandoned. But in more recent times, the broad and general use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has resulted in the development of multiresistant strains of bacteria with limited or no response to existing treatments and thus a need for alternative treatment options.

However, only very few mAbs are approved for veterinary use. mAbs therapies are expensive, and this has been a barrier for their development in the presence of inexpensive antibiotics. The use of antibiotics as growth promoters came to an end in 2017 in the USA with the rest of the world already limiting their use for this purpose manner (FDA 2015). This opens the door to new technologies and antibodies from monoclonal sources, chicken eggs, cow colostrum, or other sources to be among the chief contenders for limiting diseases in a safe manner and potentially to act as growth promoters. For that purpose, antibodies and antibody-derived treatments offer very attractive tools and attributes to neutralize infectious agents or modulate the immune system to enable effector cells to escape immunosuppressed conditions and contribute to the elimination of infections. The ability to raise antibodies to any target, and the ability to modulate effector functions, half-life, and size of the treatment units, makes antibodies ideal for tailoring treatments for specific infectious agents.

In allergic diseases, the use of mAbs to inhibit production of IgE via its promoting cytokines such as interleukins IL-4/IL-13, their cytokine receptors, or IgE itself might be beneficial in dogs and cats with IgE-mediated atopic dermatitis or food allergies. The itch sensation itself could be altered, at least theoretically, by antibodies targeting itch-promoting cytokines such as IL-31, nerve growth factor, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, or neuromediators involved in itch transmission. In arthritis therapeutic mAbs that inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL1, etc.) or their receptors are likely to be of benefit in treating dogs and cats with arthritis.
