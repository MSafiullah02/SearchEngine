One of the greatest therapeutic successes in this was underpinned by groundwork laid by Kohler and Milstein (Nobel Prize 1984). Their demonstration of how exquisitely specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be made has transformed the physician's formulary. Well over a hundred mAbs are in therapeutic use, and many more are used in diagnostics. The trend continues. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed seven mAbs for therapeutic use. However, this pathway of drug development is starting to feel like the molecular roulette of the previous therapeutic revolution during which more and more small organic molecules were developed through combinatorial chemistry, each new but each much of a muchness. It was the age of \u2018me\u2010too\u2019 benzodiazepines, beta\u2010blockers and ACE inhibitors, all new but with only marginal improvements if any. However, molecular roulette optimization is still needed even for protein therapeutic agents to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.",

This therapeutic approach of specific targeting with short\u2010chain nucleic acid molecules is known as oligonucleotide therapy. Although fomivirsen, the first such therapy, was introduced for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in 1998, it was not commercially successful, being soon superseded by highly active small\u2010molecule antiretroviral drugs. However, recent developments suggest that there is now a clearer path to success.13 The high degree of personalization of therapy using this approach is illustrated in a recent report of the management of a rare genetic neurodegenerative disease, from diagnosis to synthesis and evaluation of a new oligonucleotide therapy in a single\u2010patient (N of 1) trial.14\n",

However, as the recent failure of an HIV vaccine shows, viruses are elusive, mutating frequently.

Early success in explaining why Black soldiers were more prone to haemolysis than White soldiers when given the antimalarial pamaquine, and later primaquine, led to increased interest in the genetics of drug response even before the structure of DNA variation had been worked out.28, 29 Deficiency in glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) due to genetic variation explained this adverse effect, and soon after, a number of other adverse drug effects were ascribed to this deficiency.30 This led an enthusiastic editorialist at the British Medical Journal to suggest that \u2018To prevent attacks persons deficient in G6PD must avoid all potentially harmful drugs and foods. There is a case to be made for the use of routine screening tests, such as the spot\u2010test, on all males of Mediterranean, Asian, or African extraction before treatment with sulphonamides, aspirin, phenacetin, and other drugs31\u2019.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug, that is a drug that requires activation by metabolic enzymes including the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C19. In their randomized, but open, trial, they compared CYP2C19 genotype\u2010guided clopidogrel therapy versus standard treatment with ticagrelor or prasugrel, two newer agents known to be effective without genetic guidance. They showed that their genotype\u2010guided therapy was not inferior to the control drugs and resulted in a lower incidence of bleeding. This led Roden, an editorialist, to suggest that one should not wait any further before implementing genotype\u2010guided clopidogrel therapy.33\n",

In fact, in some populations, different variants of the same gene are often found. Clopidogrel has a complicated metabolic pathway, and although CYP2C19 is important, it is not clear to what extent pathway substitution occurs.34, 35 Drug metabolism is often as complex as roadways into large cities but biologically more malleable. Block one pathway and another takes over. For conventional drugs, regulators usually require three robust controlled randomized controlled trials to replicate beneficial results and test their generalizability.

However, meta\u2010analytic point estimates of effect provide little clinical guidance when the populations studied are heterogeneous. Identifying what factors contribute to any observed heterogeneity would be of greater value. For example, in one meta\u2010analysis of studies of the value of self\u2010monitoring and self\u2010determination of anticoagulation the dominant trial contributed close to half of all randomized patients. 20% of the patients were not competent in the use of self\u2010monitoring equipment, and the superiority of self\u2010testing was not shown. Yet, the conclusion of the meta\u2010analysis of highly heterogeneous studies was that self\u2010monitoring improved outcome.37 The unanswered question is who is most likely to benefit.38 Shah observed that even the four major randomized controlled trials designed to test the value of genotype\u2010guided warfarin therapy were so heterogeneous that greater insight is to be had by scrutiny of the individual trials than by the reported pooled point estimate of effect.36\n",
