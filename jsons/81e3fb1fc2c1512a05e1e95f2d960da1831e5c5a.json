It is clinically oriented, and of great value to the medical workers on the frontline. It revealed that the clinical symptoms of pregnant women were atypical, despite unavailable data about pregnancy outcome in the study. We mainly focused on the pregnancy outcome in patients with COVID-19. It seems that SARS-CoV-2 would be more friendly than its members of the coronavirus family 2 , such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which caused severe maternal and neonatal complications 3 . Currently, it is too early yet to explicitly determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and their fetuses 4 .

Firstly, unlike previous reports about the favorable outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 might have similar behavior to SARS and MERS, resulting in severe maternal and neonatal outcomes including preterm delivery, PROM, fetal distress, stillborn or neonatal death, admission to ICU or NICU, undergoing endotracheal intubation, septic shock, eclampsia, and MODS. Secondly, those who are older or those who have medical histories such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease tend to fare worse 5 , other than that, immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy might contribute to the rapid deterioration into severe or critical illness. Considering the unfavorable outcomes in pregnant patients, any suspected cases during pregnancy should be systematic screening; closely follow-up for mothers and their fetuses after diagnosis should be emphasized. Finally, despite all livebirths were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the stillbirth and one neonatal death at 18-days of birth indicated the potential risk of intrauterine infection 6 . There should be more evidence to deep investigation in the future study.",
