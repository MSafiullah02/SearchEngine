Others who might benefit from organ transplantation are either not yet \u2018sick enough\u2019 to be placed on official waiting lists, or suffer from diseases (diabetes, cirrhosis) that might be treated with organ, islet or cellular transplants if the supply of tissues were increased dramatically. In 1907 Alexis Carrel suggested that the future of transplantation for the treatment of organ failure was \u2018heterotransplantation\u2019. This transplantation of cells, tissues, or vascularized organs from nonhuman species into humans, now termed xenotransplantation, would have the theoretical advantage of providing an unlimited supply of transplantable organs as either permanent organ replacements or as \u2018bridges\u2019 to the availability of human\u2010derived organs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). In addition, these organs might be resistant to infection by common human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus or HIV.",

The likelihood of clinical success of xenotransplantation was initially enhanced by the development of genetically modified swine which express human complement regulatory proteins. More recently, pigs have been produced that have disrupted genes for the enzyme alpha\u20101,3\u2010galactosyltransferase; these swine are unable to express \u03b1\u22121,3\u2010gal (Gal) sugars on their cells, which is the major endothelial antigen targeted by hyperacute, humoral graft rejection. The combination of immune suppression, use of organs across histocompatability barriers, and the absence of pre\u2010existing immunity in the recipient to animal\u2010derived organisms, render the host more susceptible to infection. Consequently, infection is likely to remain a significant barrier to xenotransplantation even as immune barriers are breached. Indeed, public attention regarding xenotransplantation has focused less on these immunologic hurdles than on the on the possible spread of infection from nonhuman species to human xenograft recipients and into the community at large (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). This theoretical risk merits reconsideration in light of data assembled over the past 10 years regarding the degree of infectious risk posed by xenotransplantation.",

Theoretical concerns regarding transmission of novel pathogens from pigs to humans gained substance with the description of a family of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and the demonstration that this family of viruses is capable of infecting human cells in vitro (18, 19, 20).

Hyperacute graft rejection (HAR) is the effect of preformed (\u2018natural\u2019) antibodies present in humans and other Old World primates against a ubiquitous Gal epitope expressed on (porcine) vascular endothelial cells (2, 4, 5, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32). With HAR, the binding of antibody with complement deposition results in the rapid death of vascularized xenografts. Strategies to prevent hyperacute rejection have included depletion of anti\u2010Gal antibodies and genetic engineering of swine to express human complement regulatory proteins on porcine xenografts to decrease complement deposition and tissue injury. However, some of these complement regulatory proteins also serve as cellular receptors for human pathogens (e.g. CD46 and measles) to which swine are not naturally susceptible. Consequently, it is possible that human measles virus might be given an opportunity to grow in transgenic porcine cells and have the capacity to infect either the transgenic swine, or transgenic xenografts in human hosts (33). It is also notable that natural antibodies may provide an immunological defense against human infection by retroviruses, parasites and other common organisms carrying Gal epitopes. Thus, depletion of anti\u2010Gal antibodies may, theoretically, allow transmission of porcine viruses (carrying the Gal epitope) from a porcine xenograft to the host. However, the role of such antibodies in vivo remains unknown.",

Xenografts from these animals survive longer than unmodified grafts (D. H. Sachs, personal communication).

The course of accidentally transmitted infection resulting from HIV\u20101 can be accelerated in transplant recipients, manifesting disease (AIDS) within 6 months (35). Concern about retroviral transmission in xenotransplantation relates to the potential for \u2018silent\u2019 transmission, i.e. an unapparent infection which may cause altered gene regulation, oncogenesis, or recombination. The activation of latent virus and the development of clinical manifestations, if any, may be delayed for more than a decade. Pigs do not possess exogenous viruses equivalent to HTLV or HIV. However, endogenous retroviruses (part of the germ line DNA) have been demonstrated in all species studied to date. Endogenous retroviruses that are infectious for human cells in vitro have been detected in many mammalian species including baboons (BaEV), cats (RD114), mice (murine ERV), and pigs (PERV). Although the pig genome contains many sequences closely related to mouse mammary tumor virus (B\u2010type), murine leukemia virus (C\u2010type), and Mason\u2010Pfizer monkey virus (d\u2010type) retrovirus sequences, only three closely related C\u2010type PERV (PERV A, B, C) have been identified in swine that possess infectious potential (36, 37, 38, 39). Two of these, PERV\u2010A and \u2010B, can infect human and pig cells in vitro (20). The third subgroup, PERV\u2010C, infects porcine cells only (20). Infectious forms of the remaining PERV families have not been isolated and are unlikely to encode infectious virus owing to disruptions in open\u2010reading frames (ORFs) (36). Pig ERV mRNAs are expressed in all pig tissues and in all breeds of swine tested to date, and expression can be amplified by stimulation of swine peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. There is variation between tissues in terms of the size and amount of PERV mRNA transcripts, consistent with in vivo recombination and/or processing (18).",

Swine can be classified according to whether their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) either do or do not transmit PERV to human cells in vitro. Such animals are termed either \u2018transmitters\u2019 or \u2018nontransmitters\u2019. High\u2010titer human\u2010tropic PERVs isolated from \u2018transmitting\u2019 animals are recombinants between PERV\u2010A and PERV\u2010C sequences (38, 47). Although the site of recombination varies, viral sequences are derived from the recombination of PERV\u2010A elements with the post\u2010VRA (envelope) region of PERV\u2010C. Therefore, although PERV\u2010C is not capable of infecting human cells, it appears to be an essential component of high\u2010titer human\u2010tropic PERV from these swine and may be important in the assessment of infectious risk associated with xenotransplantation. The source of such recombinants in vivo is unknown; analysis of the germ\u2010line DNA of transmitting animals has not identified the presence of such recombinant viruses (48). Thus, swine with incomplete genomic provirus (i.e. Porcine endogenous retrovirus A without a complete env gene) might be able to generate infectious recombinant viruses in the presence of infectious PERV\u2010C. No evidence of infection has been demonstrated of human cells in vivo and no disease resulting from this family of viruses has been described in swine or humans to date (49\u201354). Porcine endogenous retrovirus appears to be susceptible to currently available antiviral agents (55). Some data suggest that primary cell lines of primates (baboons, gorilla, and macaques) can be infected by PERV\u2010A, \u2010B, and possibly \u2010C, which enhances the value of preclinical studies in primates (56). However, other studies question the value of these models, as the infection of nonhuman primate tissues is often abortive. Whether humans are equally nonpermissive remains to be determined.",

Extensive molecular screening identified three families of herpesviruses in swine: porcine CMV, and porcine lymphotropic virus\u20101 and \u20102 (PLHV\u20101, \u20102). Replication of porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is enhanced by intensive immune suppression in pig\u2010to\u2010primate models of xenotransplantation (21, 22). Porcine cytomegalovirus infection causes tissue\u2010invasive infection in porcine xenografts in baboon hosts and contributes to endothelial injury and consumptive coagulopathy (CC) in some animals (57). Based on molecular and histological evaluations, PCMV does not appear to cause invasive disease in tissues of baboons that have received porcine xenografts (21). It is possible to exclude PCMV from herds of swine by early weaning of newborns (58). The absence of PCMV improves graft survival and reduces coagulopathy in pig\u2010to\u2010baboon xenotransplantation.

Porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus\u20101 is associated with a syndrome of lymphoid proliferation in swine undergoing experimental allogeneic hematopoietic stem\u2010cell transplantation. This syndrome has characteristics similar to post\u2010transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) (5, 23, 24, 60).

The role of this virus in the pathogenesis of PTLD is under investigation. In porcine allogeneic hematopoietic stem\u2010cell transplantation, the risk of PTLD in swine is related to the overall intensity of immune suppression, the MHC disparity between donor and host, the degree of T\u2010cell depletion, and the PLHV activation that precedes B\u2010cell proliferation.

These include hantavirus (mice), SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome owing to a new coronavirus possibly associated with civets), BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus thought to evolve from primate viruses). In each case, the epidemiology was defined after the recognition of a new clinical syndrome and the development of new, rapid, molecular assays for the causative agent [discussed in (68)]. As an example, sporadic cases of zoonotic human infection with swine influenza A viruses have been detected in the United States, Europe, Asia, and New Zealand since 1976, most with direct evidence of exposure to swine (69, 70). Influenza A viruses circulate in many animal hosts that may serve as a reservoir for human disease. In most cases, these viruses are not adapted for human infection and cannot cause human disease. As a result, the number of individuals affected is small compared with the number involved in pig farming (71). Pigs may also serve as hosts for the adaptation of avian respiratory viruses to human hosts. Thus, human, porcine, and avian viruses may undergo genetic reassortment in swine to produce novel strains of pandemic potential (72, 73, 74, 75). It is possible that infected lung xenografts might, for example, provide the \u2018Petri dish\u2019 for recombination between porcine and human influenza viruses, particularly in the immunocompromised host. This theoretical concern can be addressed via the breeding of herds of source animals in isolation from human respiratory viruses from animal caretakers and adventitious birds and rodents.

Concerns regarding xenotransplantation were raised by these authors and others when clinical trials were first proposed and focused largely on those pathogens that could not be \u2018removed\u2019 by selective breeding \u2013 the endogenous retroviruses and possibly herpes viruses of swine. Data generated over the past 10 years suggest that the risks of human infection resulting from xenotransplantation are manageable. More so, the risk of the spread of infection to contacts of the xenograft recipient appears to be low. Careful screening and early weaning of donor swine can exclude many potential human pathogens in isolated herds with routine microbial surveillance. Unfortunately, the risk of infection will never be zero. Further studies in swine will elucidate pathogenic mechanisms (e.g. retroviral recombination and the pathogenesis of post\u2010transplant lymphomas). Current data suggest, however, that consideration can now be reasonably given to research into other barriers to clinical xenotransplantation (immune and metabolic) as a prelude to clinical trials.",
