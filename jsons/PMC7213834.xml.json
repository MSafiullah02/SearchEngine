Autopsy examinations have demonstrated microcirculation damage and thrombosis with venous and arterial microembolism [3]. COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization and diffuse intravascular coagulation [4, 5]. No cases of arterial mesenteric embolism have been reported in the current literature.",

His blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, oxygen saturation was 99% on room air, heart rate was 90 bpm, and temperature was 36.3\u00b0C. The abdomen was soft, not distended, and painful to palpation in the epigastric-mesogastric region. Blood tests demonstrated a regular white cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 44 mg/dl (lower than the previous value of 65 mg/dl at hospital discharge). An abdominal x-ray and ultrasound were performed, proving negative for abdominal disease. The patient started combination therapy with continuous infusion of omeprazole as a gastroprotectant and intravenous fentanest 100 \u03bcg as a painkiller and was monitored in the emergency department.",

Blood analysis showed leucocytosis (30,000 white blood cells) and CRP 222 mg/dl. An urgent surgical consultation was requested and a new abdominal CT scan showed arterial thrombosis of vessels efferent of the superior mesenteric artery with bowel distension (Fig. 1). Surgical examination confirmed the intestinal ischaemia. An intestinal resection with stapled side-to side anastomosis was performed. The patient was discharged from hospital 10 days after surgery, with regular bowel function. He was instructed to continue LMWH plus aspirin 100 mg per day.",
