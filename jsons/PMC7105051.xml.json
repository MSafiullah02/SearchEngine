The main common character of these materials as biosensor matrices is their vast 3D internal surface area, which functions as a substrate capable of immobilizing oligonucleotide probes or ligand receptors to capture more biological target molecules than traditional planar substrates. However, the problems of fragility and thermal resistance of these materials have not been thoroughly addressed, limiting the application of these materials. As we show in this contribution, silica aerogel can provide a good solution to these problems.",

Although the supercritical drying method is also a viable option to produce the aerogels [8], [11], in order to avoid the harsh conditions of high temperature and high pressure used in this technique, in this study, the aerogel was prepared by the sol\u2013gel process with a reusable ionic liquid (IL) as the solvent and pore-forming agent. The unique properties of IL, including negligible vapor pressure and ionicity, allowed the hydrolysis and condensation of the sol\u2013gel polymerization to produce a stable gel network without excess shrinkage and also retain the aerogel structure after the solvent extraction and freeze-drying process [9]. The as-prepared aerogel was then applied for recognition of a sequence-specific deoxynucleotide acid (DNA) target and compared the results with those from traditional planar slides.",

CANX is a molecular chaperone found primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for proper protein folding. Correct protein assembly in the membrane is supported by CANX, which retains intermediate structures in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to ternary complex formation completion [16]. CANX is also frequently used as a house-keeper control in microarray technology [17], [18].

The networking precursor of the aerogel, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), the solvent, methanol, and the surface-modifying reagent of aerogel, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO), were also all obtained from Acros Company. The DNA targets were PCR (polymerase chain reaction) products amplified from two human genes in total RNA: ATP5O (313 bp) and CANX (1027 bp). Table 1\nlists their gene information and the primers participating in the PCR process. The 5\u2032-end modified amino linker of the DNA-oligo probe allowed it to covalently bind either with the epoxy-modified surface of 3D aerogel or to commercial 2D glass slides (Phalanx Biotech, Hsinchu, Taiwan). Both probe and primer sequences are listed in Table 1. The conformations of DNA-probe immobilization and probe-target hybridization are shown in Fig. 1\n. All RNA, PCR primers and probes were purchased from ScinoPharm (Tainan, Taiwan). The probe immobilization buffer was prepared from SSC (sodium chloride\u2013sodium citrate buffer, Amresco), glycerol (ICN Biomedicals) and ddH2O (Milli-Q synthesis A10 system). The biochip washing buffers were made from sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; Amresco, USA) and SSC.

A different approach was then conducted. The double-stranded (ds) cDNA was first produced from the total RNA by the reverse-transcript (RT) PCR procedure provided by the manufacturer. The consequent dsDNA product then served as the template of the second round of asymmetrical PCR process. In the first run of regular PCR, 2 \u03bcl template was mixed with 2 \u03bcl F1 primer (10 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcl R1 primer (10 \u03bcM), 1.25 \u03bcl dNTP (10 mM), 1 \u03bcl Taq, DNA polymerase (5 U \u03bcl\u22121), 5 \u03bcl PCR buffer (10\u00d7), and 36.75 \u03bcl ddH2O to make a total volume of 50 \u03bcl. As indicated in Table 1, the primers were ATP5O-F1/ATP5O-R1 or CANX-F1/CANX-R1. The PCR process was set as denaturalization step 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, annealing step 52 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension step 72 \u00b0C for 1 min with total 40 cycles. The PCR product, dsDNA, was purified and ready for the second PCR run to asymmetrically amplify the ssDNA target.",

[21], the resonances of the different species of Si atoms in silica are located between \u221280 and \u2212110 ppm, as identified by the Qn terminology. Q0 denotes the silicon with no Si\u2014O\u2014Si linkage and Qn denotes the silicon with n Si\u2014O\u2014Si linkages, where n = 1\u20134. Generally, the tetra substitution (Q4) results in a characteristic peak between \u2212100 and \u2212110 ppm. Similarly Q3 occurs between \u221290 and \u2212100 ppm and Q2 occurs between \u221280 and \u221290 ppm. Fig. 3\na shows the 29Si solid-state NMR spectrum of the as-prepared silica aerogel. Its Q4 characteristic peak appeared at \u2212110 ppm, Q3 at \u2212102 ppm, and Q2 at \u221292 ppm. Their proportion in as-prepared silica aerogel was Q4:Q3:Q2\n = 55.9:39.0:5.1.

Fig. 3b shows the 29Si solid-state NMR spectrum for post-modification of hydroxyl to epoxy functional groups. Its T3 characteristic peaks appeared at \u221266 ppm and T2 at \u221257 ppm with a simultaneous Q3 proportion that had dropped to 14.6%, indicating that about 22.3% of the aerogel surface was converted to the epoxy functional group.",

The extent of gas adsorption on the material is closely related to the nature of the sample and the gas. It is also dependent on the working pressure and temperature. An adsorption isotherm, which plots the amount of gas adsorption per unit weight of sample against the ratio of working pressure to the saturated vapor pressure of the gas, is usually presented as the measurement result. Fig. 4\nshows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of the silica aerogel product, which exhibited a type-IV isotherm based on the classification of Brunauer et al. [22]. In this type of material, adsorption occurs in the micropores at very low pressure, followed by adsorption in the mesopores, with capillary condensation occurring at higher pressures, leading to the hysteresis loops [23]. The measurement indicated a specific surface area of 813 m2\n g\u22121, pore volume of 0.78 cm3\n g\u22121, and average pore diameter of 4.2 nm. After the epoxy modification, these levels dropped to 471 m2\n g\u22121, 0.48 cm3\n g\u22121, and 3.7 nm, respectively. The data suggest that modified silica aerogel was still a mesoporous material.

Here, 1 \u03bcl of 20 nM DNA target was first added onto all top-four-row aerogel dots and then the slide was washed to remove the unbounded sample. The same procedure, including the target addition and the slide cleaning, was then applied to the top-three-row, top-two-row, and top-one-row dots for the second, third and fourth time, sequentially. Thus, the accumulated sample volume of each aerogel-spot row became 4, 3, 2 and 1 \u03bcl. After repeated washes, some aerogel dropped off from the slide to cause donut-shape spots, but the signal trend can still easily be seen. The 1 \u03bcl-sample row developed less signal intensity than that developed by the same sample-volume spot at Fig. 9 due to repeated washes. However, it is still clear that aerogel spots loaded with more sample volume significantly gained in signal intensity. The 4 \u03bcl sample row obviously had signal intensity higher than the 20 nM sample in Fig. 9. It can thus be concluded that the aerogel functions as a sample reservoir collecting more samples to intensify detection signal.",
