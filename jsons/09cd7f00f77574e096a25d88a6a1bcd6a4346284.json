Methods and Results: An antifungal peptide designated as brassiparin was isolated. It exhibited a molecular mass of 5716 Da. It potently inhibited mycelial growth in a number of fungal species including Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium maydis, Mycosphaerella arachidicola and Valsa mali. The antifungal activity of brassiparin toward M. arachidicola exhibited pronounced thermostability and pH stability. It inhibited proliferation of hepatoma (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF7) cells and the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Its N-terminal sequence differed from those of antifungal proteins which have been reported to date. Conclusions: Brassiparin can be purified by using a protocol involving ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography and gel filtration. It manifests potent, thermostable and pH-stable antifungal activity. It demonstrates antiproliferative activity toward tumour cells, and inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Thus, brassiparin is a defense protein.",

However, only one antifungal peptide has been reported from Brassica campestris seeds (Lin et al. 2007 ) despite the existence of many Brassica species. The seeds of Brassica campestris and B. parachinensis have medicinal use in traditional Chinese medicine. The aim of the present study was to purify an antifungal peptide from the seeds of B. parachinensis, to compare it with the antifungal peptide previously isolated from B. campestris seeds (Lin et al. 2007) , and to ascertain other potentially exploitable activities of the peptide.",

The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template \u2044 primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin-and biotin-labelled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labelled DNA binds to the surface of microtitre plate modules that have been precoated with streptavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigeninlabelled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a coloured reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtitre plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4-6 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the antifungal peptide was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the antifungal peptide Ng 2002a, 2002b) .

It constitutes the first report on the isolation of an antifungal peptide from the seeds of a Brassica species. The present findings furnish evidence for the presence of an antifungal peptide in another Brassica species. However, the N-terminal sequences of the two Brassica antifungal peptides were different although both manifested remarkable thermostability and pH stability, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, and antiproliferative activity toward tumour cells. Both exerted antifungal activity toward F. oxysporum, M. arachidicola and a Helminthosporium species. This is noteworthy in view of the observation that some antifungal proteins exhibited antifungal activity toward only one fungus out of the several fungal species tested Ng 2001, 2002a) . Brassica parachinensis napin showed sequence similarity to Sinapis arvensis trypsin inhibitor and exhibited trypsin inhibitory activity. However, brassiparin did not resemble its homologous napin in N-terminal sequence and exhibited no trypsin inhibitory activity. This is noteworthy in view of the fact that some of the trypsin inhibitors demonstrated antifungal activity (Ye et al. 2001) . Both Brassica antifungal peptides were also isolated by using similar protocols. Ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Mono S, and gel filtration on Superdex Peptide were used for isolation of B. campestris antifungal peptide. The present protocol for brassiparin differed only in the replacement of Q-Sepharose by SP-Sepharose. The yield of brassiparin (80 mg \u2044 kg) was lower than that of B. campestris antifungal peptide (175 mg kg )1 ). Its HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 17AE8 lmol l )1 ) was also lower than that of B. campestris antifungal peptide (IC 50 = 4 lmol l )1 ), but more potent than many anti-HIV-1 natural products (Ng et al. 1997) . Similarly, its antiproliferative activity toward HepG2 cells and MCF-7 cells (IC 50 = 19AE2 and 4AE8 lmol l )1 , respectively) was lower than that of B. campestris antifungal peptide (IC 50 = 5AE8 and 1AE6 lmol l )1 , respectively). Antifungal peptides from both B. parachinensis peptide and B. campestris were devoid of mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes. It has previously been shown that some (Ye et al. 2001; Wang and Ng 2003; Chu and Ng 2004) but not other (Lin et al. 2007 ) antifungal proteins \u2044 peptides exhibited mitogenic activity. Both brassiparin and B. campestris antifungal peptide had no inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase, unlike some other antifungal proteins . They were also inactive toward SARS coronavirus proteinase. Frech bean defensin-like antifungal peptide resembled the two Brassica antifungal peptides in that it did not have any suppressive effect on HIV-1 integrase and SARS proteinase (Leung et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "When brassiparin is compared with turtle bean chitinase-like antifungal protein (Chu and Ng, 2005) which is an example of a leguminous and non-brassicaceous antifungal protein, it is seen that both are adsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel and a cationic exchanger (SP-Sepharose \u2044 CM-cellulose). Both are devoid of mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes. The antifungal activity of brassiparin is more thermostable (fully preserved in brassiparin vs completely abrogated in the other after heating at 100\u00b0C for 10 min) and approximately eight-fold more potent (IC 50 = 3AE9 lmol l )1 in brassiparin vs 35AE1 lmol l )1 in the other toward F. oxysporum, and 3AE6 lmol l )1 in brassiparin vs 18AE3 lmol l )1 in the other toward M. arachidicola).",
