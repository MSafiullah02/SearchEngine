More disease and usually includes a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary segment, which accounts for sharp interruption of natural history. Heart dysfunction appears more in the the regional myocardial blood flow [1,2]. On the contrary, form of electrical instability than of impaired contractility, coronary SD in the young is usually due to a single which, on the contrary, may be enhanced. Risk factors are subobstructive plaque, located at the first segment of the considered to be youth, previous syncopal episodes, a anterior descending coronary artery, mostly fibrocellular, malignant family history, myocardial ischemia, sustained devoid of atheroma, fissuring or thrombosis [7] (Fig. 2) . In ventricular tachycardia on electrophysiological test and the setting of acute thrombosis, superficial erosion seems ventricular tachycardia on holter monitoring, attenuated to be a peculiar mechanism precipitating plaque instability, blood pressure changes on exercise and enhanced QRS unlike in adults where it is mainly due to rupture of the fractionation of the extrasystole [30] . Recently, molecular thin fibrous cap of an atheromatous plaque [24] .

Several reports, using seems that the phenotype varies not only with the type of molecular hybridization assays, have shown a correlation mutation but also within individuals carrying the same between the occurrence of atherosclerosis and the presence mutation. For instance the arginine-to-glutamine mutation of infective microorganisms, like herpesviruses and in 403 codon of b-myosin is associated with a poor Chlamydia pneumoniae [27] . Although a cause-effect prognosis, whereas the arginine-to-tryptophan mutation relationship is far from being demonstrated and these appears more benign [32] . Moreover, the knowledge that microorganisms could act simply as 'innocent bystanders', myosin-binding protein C mutations appear to be associsome microbial infections have been associated with acute ated with age-related penetrance in adulthood and that coronary syndromes; in particular, an increase in en-troponin T mutation is associated with up to 50% of non terovirus-specific antibodies at the time of myocardial penetrance, no or mild hypertrophy (HCM 'without hyinfarction diagnosis suggests a role for this virus in pertrophy') and a high risk of SD, even in the absence of triggering acute coronary syndromes [28, 29] At postmortem, the heart shows asymmetric left ven-HCM is heart muscle disease phenotypically character-tricular hypertrophy, usually in the basal portion of the ized by either symmetric or asymmetric left ventricular ventricular septum but also in the anterior free wall and hypertrophy with a chaotic spatial arrangement of the apex [34] (Fig. 3) . The septal bulging together with a myocytes ('disarray'), often marked by SD along the septal endocardial plaque and anterior mitral valve leaflet thickening, may account for the left ventricular outflow gradient. plasia, is one of the leading causes of SD in the young in reentrant phenomena, in the shape of ventricular arrhythmias with left bundle branch block morphology, indicating a right ventricular origin. Familiarity with an autosomal dominant inheritance has been demonstrated in nearly 50% of cases [37] . Six loci have been identified by linkage analysis so far, two mapping to chromosome 14 and the remaining to chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 10, one each. Recently, we identified a mutation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene in families who map to chromosome 1q42-q43 [38] . A recessive form associated with palmoplantar keratosis has also been also reported on chromosome 17 and a defective gene encoding for a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule, i.e. plakoglobin, has been found [39] . Apoptosis has been demonstrated to account for myocyte death both in autopsy and biopsy material [40] . RV aneurysms, left ventricular involvement, focal myocarditis as well as bouts of apoptosis, most probably worsen ventricular electrical vulnerability and lower the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Evidence of inflammatory infiltrates associate with myocyte death is a frequent finding in several pathological series [41] : whether inflammation is primary or secondary to cell death remains to be established. To test the infective etiopathogenetic theory, we recently did a nested PCR investigation which failed to detect any enteroviral genome in biopsies of ARVC patients with both recent and chronic clinical onset of the disease [42] . However, it may be that other types of virus are involved and need to be searched for. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. The natural history demonstrates few cases arrhythmic SD may be the first manifestation of the disease and the diagnosis is achieved only at postmortem by observing a heavy heart with dilated ventricles our geographic area [6, 35, 36] .
