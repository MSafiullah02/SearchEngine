And in these articles, health is the common thread that connects humans, animals, and the environment; however, this underlying link is often undervalued, leaving a \"gap\" that challenges our ability to prevent and mitigate major global catastrophes. The Ebola virus disease has ravaged West Africa, leaving a swath of devastation and unanswered questions in its wake, but it highlights the alarming potential of a zoonotic disease, one of hundreds that pass between animals and humans. Climate change continues to fuel controversy, but it is undeniable that our exploitation of the Earth is impacting the fundamental resources that form the foundation of our existence. The state of our ecosystems is integral to the conservation and sustainable management of our wildlife and natural resources. The health of the environment cannot be segregated from our own health; thus, we need to examine health from a global stance. Our traditional perspectives of \"health\" and \"disease\" are outdated, and it is prime time for us to reevaluate our approaches to engage a comprehensive audience as well as holistic strategies to address these issues as \"One Health.\"",

However, we, and our unabated population growth, have had an increasing hand in manipulating the state of the world and that of our future. Our influence over Earth's dynamics through the millennia has contributed to the degradation of ecosystems and the exploitation of natural resources, also referred to as \"ecosystem goods and services.\" Ecosystems and their goods and services-food, air, water, nutrient cycling, for example-are the foundation for our health and well-being. These essential functions sustain human health and, in effect, life as we know it (MEA 2005) . Even subtle shifts in ecosystem services can topple this fragile equilibrium and trigger social, economic, political, and demographic changes that potentially endanger our future. Thus, the ubiquitous, ever-expanding human footprint has fuelled unprecedented resource demands that have led to the urgent need to manage and conserve our natural capital in hope of a sustainable future. For example, we \"consume\" in one way or another as much as 40 % of all solar energy trapped by land plants (Erlich and Wilson 1991) , a selfish action that not only threatens other species but that of our own (eds Grifo and Rosenthal 1997) . Forests provide numerous ecosystem services that are fundamental to \"health,\" including energy production, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling, but with the current rate of deforestation measured in acres per minute, our myopic actions defy logic, hence jeopardizing the future of this planet ( Fig. 18.1) .",

In a concept that is simultaneously rudimentary and revolutionary, the \"One Health\" paradigm examines these challenges through a new multidisciplinary lens, addressing the issues through a consilience of human, animal, and ecosystem health, but this concept faces an uphill battle against tradition to gain traction. In June 2012, Rio + 20, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, fell short on many fronts, but in its singular focus on economic development, failed to consider the social and environmental pillars that are integral to sustainable development. Science-based evidence on global health issues were overshadowed by ideology and the final outcome \"The future we want\" omitted health as a cross-sectoral priority in sustainable development. Nevertheless, the general approach of this document allows for an unprecedented opportunity to engage health sectors, in all their incarnations, in the dialogue towards sustainable development goals (Langlois 2012) .

Thousands of international and local conservation organizations and scores of professional scientists excel at quantifying conservation needs in order to objectively develop sciencebased strategies that counter present and future threats, with the goal of balancing man and nature. Conservation organizations, constrained by their areas of expertise and financial resources, focus on protecting species and habitats in a progressively anthropogenic arena. However, delineating national park boundaries and building fences to physically separate humans and wildlife animals is a less viable tool nowadays, particularly in developing countries where there is extensive interdependence between livelihoods and ecosystem services and where resource competition is fierce. Conservationists increasingly acknowledge that the root of many conservation issues stems from conflicts over space and resources and clashes with social or cultural beliefs, the underpinnings of which may fall outside of their sphere of knowledge and influence. As a result, conservationists need to look beyond their traditional strongholds and collaborate with other sectors, including social, political, and health: conservation alone can no longer protect biodiversity.",

Projects that target wildlife ecology may overlook the opportunity to collect biological samples that could assist with management strategies, as the knowledge of baseline population health can help detect trends and identify potential new threats. Ecological studies that require animal capture, such as radio-collaring, offer a unique opportunity to collect biological samples. When pronghorn antelope were radio-collared in the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming, to identify migration corridors ( Fig. 18 .2), measurements and biological samples were simultaneously collected to test for pregnancy rates and stress levels as part of a comprehensive effort to establish comprehensive baseline information about pronghorn antelope ecology (Beckmann et al. 2008) . Gillespie et al. (2008) discuss multiple invasive and noninvasive sampling techniques to monitor for infectious disease and parameters of health in wild primates for both the conservation of wild animals and the safeguarding of human health. While humans and wild primates are at particular risk of epizootic and zoonotic disease due to our close evolutionary relationship, the same sampling techniques and data can be used across taxa for similar means.",

Gomez and Aguirre (2008) identified 29 pathogens diagnosed and documented in illegally traded wildlife included numerous epizootic, zoonotic, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Conservation organizations need to collaborate within and among themselves as well as engage influential sectors beyond conservation to tackle the source of the problem, as well as develop strategies to mitigate the effects. In November 2012, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a \"concerted global response\" (WWF 2012b) to address wildlife trafficking, a multinational criminal activity that rivals drugs and human trafficking-and only with the joint efforts between countries and between disciplines can this trade be halted.",

Health is an elusive term that can be defined as a continuum between illness and wellness, partly determined by each individual's ability to cope with and adapt to stress (Lyon 2000) . Health is not \"black and white,\" but encompasses a range of indices including physiological, psychological, spiritual, cultural, and developmental. Perhaps, health needs to always be used in conjunction with \"well-being,\" the latter encompassing all non-disease factors, particularly those that pertain to our environment? Nevertheless, we need to realize that health, a constant undercurrent in our daily lives, affects living organisms, the environment, and even global economies.

Through complex, integrated mechanisms that we still struggle to comprehend, the health of one can have cascading and/or compounding effects on the others, and the condition of the environment can directly or indirectly affect the health and well-being of humans, with the most obvious consequences at the nexus of livelihoods and the environment. These relationships need to be recognized and health needs to be addressed as a whole. Simultaneously, the human health community needs to appreciate that while human health is the priority, it is closely linked to animal and ecosystem health, and any imbalance in this trifecta can topple the delicate equilibrium, affecting the status of all three.",

Prior to this, medicine could treat clinical signs and provide palliative therapy, such as cough suppressants and fever reducers, but afterwards, we could identify and treat the proximate cause of disease by preventing and eliminating infection of causative agents. Subsequently, we have increasingly recognized more ultimate causes of disease such as diet, exercise, lifestyle, and heredity. Discoveries in the field of genetics and the development of molecular medicine have transformed how we understand and approach predisposition to and development of disease.

The implementation of community-based programs to educate and build capacity in local communities allowed the eradication of the vector by populating the mosquitoes' breeding sites with local predacious copepods. In this example, a strong community approach addressing a predominant human health problem through a collaboration of health education and understanding of vector ecology resulted in strong and sustainable outcomes, whereas the application of pesticides would probably result in greater costs and dependence of the communities, unpredictable side effects on the environment, and, most importantly, a less effective control of the disease.",

However, SARS could have been detected and potentially prevented through disease surveillance in wild animals and the enforcement of policies on the illegal movement and consumption of wildlife in Southeast Asia. Three species of cave-dwelling bats were ultimately found to be the reservoir for SARS-like coronaviruses (Li et al. 2005) . These animals are often sold in wet markets, and although the transmission dynamics are not clearly delineated, this virus likely infected humans through intermediary hosts like civets, which are heavily traded for food (Black 2005) . While scientific laboratories and pharmaceutical companies are vying to develop vaccines, perhaps human health and conservation partners should simultaneously collaborate with governments and communities to stop the trade in wild species which would benefit all sectors? This trade not only impacts biodiversity and health but also global economies (Fig. 18.3) . Increasing pressure, particularly from governments, national Ministries of Health, and multilateral agencies such as the United Nations, would add weight to flagging policies and possibly bolster national enforcement, as evidenced by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech to strengthen the enforcement of wildlife laws globally (Staziuso 2012).",

It is difficult to quantify the net impact of biodiversity loss on human health and well-being, but because biodiversity is necessary for functioning ecosystems, its loss results in decreased nutritional security, medicinal resources, and critical ecosystem-derived goods and services. The World Wide Fund for Nature's (WWF's) Living Planet Report (WWF 2012a) indicates that between 1970 and 2008, biodiversity declined by 30 % (60 % in the Tropics), and this trend seems to be continuing. While the direct consequences of water and food shortages are easily recognized, many impacts of ecosystem degradation on humanity can be difficult to assess due to displacement in time and space. The underappreciation of these fundamental relationships, particularly by policymakers and the public, results in conservation and natural resource management being a low priority (Grifo and Rosenthal 1997).

Within the parasite's complex life cycle, transmission requires appropriate habitat for the mosquito vector, such as standing water, and human activities, such as changing land-use patterns, that bring the host in contact with the vector. In many parts of tropical Asia, vast tracts of primary forests are being razed for rubber and oil palm plantations at an astonishing rate. In addition to the loss of the forests, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services (Ziegler et al. 2009 ), land-use changes are likely altering disease incidence as well: rubber plantation workers may be at greater risk for contracting malaria due to increased exposure and vector proliferation (the standing water caught in sap collection cups provide habitat for mosquito larvae). The malaria researcher at the end of the microscope attributes increased disease prevalence to the trees, but in fact the true problem originates with deforestation, the conversion of forests to agricultural monocultures, and the system of rubber production. Ecosystem imbalances are largely unpredictable but seem to favor the dominance of generalist species that often become overabundant hosts or vectors (Molyneux et al. 2008) . Given that expanding monoculture rubber plantations are a major threat to native forest ecosystems in parts of the world, we must consider that in this case there can be a solution that satisfies human health as well as conservation objectives. This interface is where malaria researchers, industry, health experts, policymakers, and conservationists need to focus.",

Global warming drives changes in vector and host distribution, and hence, vector-borne diseases are expected to expand to higher latitudes and altitudes.

By influencing and possibly altering disease ecology, we not only exacerbate the threat of extinction for some species but also expose the health of humans and animals to the emergence and reemergence of pathogens (Daszak et al. 2000) . This interdependence is illustrated by the emergence of the Nipah virus, a lethal zoonotic paramyxovirus that killed over 100 people in an outbreak in Malaysia in the late 1990s (Daszak et al. 2013) . The outbreak investigation revealed that the zoonotic pathway of the disease originated from fruit bat droppings that spilled over to humans through the infection of domestic pigs. However, both the reservoir (fruit bats) and the virus were shown to occur historically in the area, and it is likely that they have long coexisted with pig farms. Daszak and colleagues (2013) postulated that two major changes allowed the intensification of this interface upset the balance, allowing the Nipah virus to \"spill over\" into humans. According to the authors, agricultural intensification-increased pig farming-created a pathway for repeated transmission of the virus from fruits bats to pigs, which could also have been exacerbated by alterations in bat distribution due to forest fires and climatic oscillations. The second condition was the priming effect that the first infections had on the pig populations, allowing the animals to acquire enough immunity to sustain the virus within the population long enough to transmit it to humans, instead of just resulting in massive pig mortalities. This outbreak clearly demonstrates the consequences of toppling the fragile equilibrium between the health of ecosystems, animals, and humans.",

This ecological disturbance likely contributed to extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) and jeopardizes the habitat of several threatened terrestrial species, including flagship species such as the golden monkey (Cercopithecus mitis). The redistribution of water and the creation of the reservoir may also increase the incidence of waterborne diseases such as schistosomiasis and allow for the accumulation of environmental pollutants such as heavy metals, toxins, and human and animal waste. Expanded habitat for the gastropod vector of schistosomiasis and the increased exposure interface resulting from the displacement of up to four million people could cause this debilitating and infectious zoonotic parasite to proliferate. The Three Gorges Dam massively altered an important waterway and disrupted vital ecosystem under the guise of improving human livelihoods and temporary economic gain, but at what cost?

Even diseases that are not fatal to humans or animals can have profound social and economic effects, hampering development and ultimately affecting human health and livelihoods. Foot-andmouth disease (FMD), an infectious viral disease in wild and domestic clovenhoofed animals, is endemic in seven out of ten Southeast Asian countries. While mortality is relatively low with this disease, morbidity impacts livestock production and national economics by limiting the growth of the livestock trade through international export. FMD-free countries will not import meat from endemic countries, and the economic losses cascade through the production chain, affecting human livelihoods. The inability of developing countries to advance their livestock production sector limits national economic growth and potential livelihood income, underscoring the direct and indirect linkages between animal and human health and well-being.",

The very real and rapid spread of these viruses captured the global spotlight and their sensationalization brought the reality of our growing dilemma to the public domain: while information (accurate or otherwise) is transmitted around the globe instantaneously, our preparedness to contend with epidemics and pandemics lags behind. In 2002 and 2003, a coronavirus, SARS, confirmed this reality by spreading from Hong Kong to 37 countries in a matter of weeks and nearly achieving pandemic status. It took the threat of pandemic avian influenza in the mid-2000s to prompt large-scale, multilat-eral, multidisciplinary projects to predict and prevent emerging pandemic threatsefforts that continue today.",

Few conservationists excel at developing social projects, and likewise, not many wildlife veterinarians have the skills to effectively engage policy makers. While each individual and each field is constrained, there are potentially endless expert partners and innovative synergies.So it does not end with the malaria expert, the microscope, and the Petri dish. Back at the meeting, the sole conservationist in the room raised her hand and asked: \"The trees seem to be responsible for development's short-sightedness: what if we could work with human disease experts and the rubber plantation owners to develop strategies as simple as covering the sap collection cups to reduce mosquito breeding and educate plantation workers on disease prevention?\"",
