In the aftermath of the SARS epidemics, China created an electronic infectious disease reporting system that collects individual case data with unified reporting card to the national Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Evidence indicated a delay in reporting of the early COVID-19 cases in the system, alluding to a lack of training of hospital staff and deficiencies in enforcing the reporting protocols, an important lesson for public health systems elsewhere. Early identification of cases and their close contacts are key in suppressing transmission of infectious diseases. Along with social distancing, massive efforts in contact tracing have paid off in containing the epidemic in the Chinese City of Ningbo [6].",

In the US, 28 million people do not have health insurance [8]. They would not be able to consult their family physician before going out for testing of COVID-19. In addition, although the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services has been made clear that screening, testing, and treatment of COVID-19 are not considered as \u201cpublic charge,\u201d undocumented immigrants may be deterred to seek public assistance [9]. Spanish-speaking population was found to be at greater risk of exposure to H1N1 during the 2008\u20132009 outbreak. They, along with African Americans who have high rates of obesity and diabetes, have suffered high rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality.

China\u2019s major payers, the Healthcare Security Administrations at various level, do not cover preventive services including influenza vaccination. Preventive services in China are financed through the limited basic public health services provided at the community health services organizations.
