In fact, IFN\u2010\u03c9 also exerts a protective effect against several viruses, including bovine enterovirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, influenza virus, European bat lyssavirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, pseudorabies virus, canine and feline parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus.7 However, the antiviral effect of IFN\u2010\u03c9 has never been assessed against FMDV. Interestingly, different subtypes of IFN\u2010\u03c9 have distinct antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. For example, among the four IFN\u2010\u03c9 pseudogenes and eight functional genes in the porcine IFN\u2010\u03c9 (PoIFN\u2010\u03c9) family, porcine IFN omega 7 (PoIFN\u2010\u03c97) has the highest antiviral activities, which are approximately 20 times than PoIFN\u2010\u03c94, which has the lowest antiviral activity.11 Additionally, IFN\u2010\u03c9 has lower in vitro cytotoxicity, compared to other interferons, making it a therapeutic candidate for treating some viral diseases.11 In this study, PoIFN\u2010\u03c97 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its antiviral effects against FMDV was assessed in vitro.",

The solution was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was collected. Subsequently, the supernatant was then loaded onto a 10 mL nickel Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column. To remove non\u2010specifically bound materials, the column was washed with 100 mL Buffer B. Next, the column was washed with a linear gradient imidazole from 20 mM to 100 mM imidazole in Buffer B, using 100 mL for each step. Finally, the target protein was eluted with 500 mM imidazole in Buffer B. Fractions containing the rHis\u2010PoIFN\u2010\u03c97 protein were pooled and identified by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Interestingly, this concentration could also exert significant protection of cells from A/GDMM/CHA/2013 infection (Figure 3C). In fact, unlike other vaccines, IFNs exert their antiviral activity against lots of viruses, no matter which the serotype or strain infected.23, 24, 25 This result was similar to the study from Usharani et al,22 in their study, they found that IFN\u2010\u03c44 also exerted broad\u2010spectrum antiviral effects against eight strains of FMDV. In post\u2010infection study, PoIFN\u2010\u03c97 (10 ng/mL) also provided cells considerable protection against CPE and displayed 1.29\u2010log reduction in viral mRNA levels at 0\u20108 hours post\u2010infection, compared to the VC group (Figure 4). Viral mRNA levels increased at 0 to 8 hours post\u2010infection and raised considerably after 8 hours, while no considerable CPE was observed in this period, these results suggest that PoIFN\u2010\u03c97 might serve as an useful adjunct treatment at the onset of the FMD outbreak as well as that within 8 hours of exposure to FMDV.",

In future studies, it will be important to assess whether combining PoIFN\u2010\u03c97 with type II IFN or IFN\u2010\u03bb leads to increasing efficacy against FMDV.
