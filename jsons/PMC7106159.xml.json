The majority of classified viruses have RNA genomes, but many have DNA genomes, and some may even have DNA and RNA at different stages in their life cycle. Attending to genome architecture, they can be either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) and some virus families (e.g., Hepadnaviridae) contain a double-stranded genome with single-stranded regions. Finally, several virus classes (RNA genomes and some with ssDNA genomes) are classified on the basis of the nature and polarity of their mRNAs, depending on whether they have the translatable information in the same or complementary strand (denoted as plus-strand, +, or minus-strand, \u2212). Several types of ssDNA (e.g., geminiviruses) and ssRNA (e.g., arenaviruses) viruses have genomes that are ambisense (+/\u2212). All these genome properties are used to classify viruses into seven groups (following Baltimore, 1971): Group I, dsDNA viruses (e.g., Herpesvirus); II, ssDNA (e.g., Parvoviruses); III, dsRNA (e.g., Reoviruses); IV, (+)ssRNA (e.g., Picornaviruses); V, (\u2212)ssRNA (e.g., Orthomyxovirus); VI, ssRNA-RT (reverse transcriptase) (e.g., Retroviruses); VII: dsDNA-RT (e.g., Hepadnaviruses). This huge biological diversity suggests multiple strategies for generating genetic diversity.",

In general, RNA viruses have smaller genomes than DNA viruses, probably as consequence of their higher mutation rates (Holmes, 2003). The reason for this inverse relationship between genome size and mutation rate is arguably the incapability of large RNA viruses to replicate without generating lethal mutations (Belshaw et al., 2007, Sanjuan et al., 2010). In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the higher fidelity of their replication enzymes. ssDNA viruses are an exception to this rule, since the mutation rates of their genomes can be as high as those seen in ssRNA genomes (Duffy and Holmes, 2009).",

            "text": "Recombination occurs when at least two viral genomes co-infect the same host cell and exchange genetic segments. Different types of viral recombination are recognized based on the structure of the crossover site (Austermann-Busch and Becher, 2012, Scheel et al., 2013). Homologous recombination occurs in the same site in both parental strands, while non-homologous or illegitimate recombination (Lai, 1992) occurs at different sites of the genetic fragments involved, frequently originating aberrant structures (Galli and Bukh, 2014). A particular type of recombination, known as shuffling or reassortment, occurs in viruses with segmented genomes, which can interchange complete genome segments, giving rise to new segment combinations. Illegitimate recombination is relatively infrequent in RNA viruses, but in DNA viruses can occur at much higher frequencies than homologous recombination (Robinson et al., 2011). In addition, the exchange of genetic material between viruses is usually non-reciprocal, meaning the recipient of a genome portion does not act as donor of the replaced portion in the original source. In this respect, the term recombination does not have the same meaning in viruses that it does in diploid, sexually reproducing organisms wherein the exchange of genetic material between chromatids in the first meiosis division is reciprocal. Viral recombination could be more appropriately denoted as \u201cgene conversion,\u201d but the term has become so widely used that it is pointless to change it.",

Indeed, recombination has been associated with the expansion of viral host ranges, the emergence of new viruses, the alteration of transmission vector specificities, increases in virulence and pathogenesis, the modification of tissue tropisms, the evasion of host immunity, and the evolution of resistance to antivirals (Martin et al., 2011a, Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011). The frequencies of recombination vary extensively among viruses. Recombination seems highly frequent in some dsDNA viruses, such as \u03b1-Herpesviruses, where recombination is intimately linked to replication and DNA repair (Robinson et al., 2011, Thiry et al., 2005) and can prevent the progressive accumulation of harmful mutations in their genomes (i.e., prevent the mutational meltdown and increase fitness). In fact, homologous recombination seems to be the most frequent mechanism in this group of viruses, although illegitimate recombination has also been observed (Robinson et al., 2011, Thiry et al., 2005, Thiry et al., 2006). DNA recombination can also facilitate access to evolutionary innovations that would otherwise be inaccessible by mutation alone, although the viability of DNA recombinants will depend on how severely recombination disrupts genome architecture and the interaction networks (Lefeuvre et al., 2009).",

In contrast, recombination occurs at variable frequencies in (+)ssRNA viruses, with some families showing high rates (e.g., Picornaviridae), while others see only occasional (e.g., Flaviviridae) or nonexistent (e.g., Leviviridae) occurrence. Current data also indicate that recombination is even far less common in (\u2212)ssRNA viruses (Holmes, 2009). Similarly, there is extensive variation in the rate of re-assortment among RNA viruses. Many segmented viruses, such as Hantaviruses, Lassa virus and Tenuiviruses, exhibit relatively low levels of re-assortment, while others show high rates (e.g., influenza A virus, rotavirus A and Cystoviruses) (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011).",

Since RNA viruses exhibit high mutation rates and large population sizes, it is more likely that these factors, rather than recombination, drive their evolutionary fate, as they regularly produce advantageous mutations and protect themselves from the accumulation of deleterious ones. There is little compelling evidence supporting the idea that recombination enhances genome repair (except in viruses with diploid or pseudodiploid genomes, such as HIV) or has evolved as a form of sexual reproduction, allowing the more efficient purging of deleterious mutations and accelerating the generation of advantageous genetic combinations (Holmes, 2009, Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011). Instead, prior hypotheses contend that mechanistic constraints associated with particular genome structures and viral life histories are the major elements shaping recombination rates in RNA viruses. Consequently, RNA recombination and re-assortment can be considered as byproducts of selection for other genomic characteristics to control gene expression, rather than being favored as specific manifestations of sexual reproduction. Nevertheless, this does not exclude the possibility that natural selection can favor specific genotypes generated by recombination (Holmes, 2009).",

Nonetheless, the new opportunities that these technologies offer also come with some serious analytical challenges that must be considered. In the following sections we briefly review (i) the different mechanisms of recombination in DNA and RNA viruses, (ii) the different methods for detecting and estimating recombination, and (iii) the impact of recombination on the inference of evolutionary forces acting on viral populations. For more comprehensive reviews on these topics, we refer the reader to the specific literature cited in each section.",

Moreover, all Herpesviruses have a common replicative complex characterized by highly conserved groups of replication and recombination proteins (Rennekamp and Lieberman, 2010). In fact, many of these proteins can be interchanged between different Herpesviruses; for example, Epstein-Barr virus proteins have been shown to replicate human cytomegalovirus (Sarisky and Hayward, 1996). In DNA viruses, recombination also plays an important role in the repair of DNA damage, especially in the latency stage (Wilkinson and Weller, 2004) but, paradoxically to previous observations, the analysis of complete genomes of many Herpesviruses has shown that the repair-initiating DNA sequences differ between \u03b1- and \u03b3-Herpesviruses, thus suggesting possible differences in the recombination mechanisms between these two subfamilies (Brown, 2014).",

            "text": "Considerable controversy exists about the onset of replication once cell infection by HSV has been completed. At present, it is not known whether viral DNA is circularized before the start of replication, although several pieces of indirect evidence (such as loss of free ends in a short time after infection and bidirectional replication) suggest that a circular DNA is formed. Therefore, we accept this as the most plausible model at this moment. When linear viral DNA reaches the cell nucleus, it is rapidly converted into a circular form by human DNA ligase IV (Fig. 1\n). Immediately, the replicative complex or replisome, constituted by a core set of seven highly conserved proteins (UL9/UL29; UL5/UL8/UL52 and UL30/UL42), begins to replicate the DNA. This is a coordinated process with several well-defined steps. DNA replication initiates when the UL9 protein (the so-called \u201corigin-binding protein\u201d) recognizes the origins of replication (ori) and disrupts the dsDNA structure. There are three ori in the HSV genome (two oriS in US fragment and one oriL in UL fragment). Mutants containing only one origin frequently undergo recombination resulting in the duplication of a second site, suggesting an evolutionary benefit in having multiple origins of replication in this virus. In the next step, the UL29 protein (also known as \u201csingle strand binding protein\u201d, ICP8) is recruited, forming an UL9-UL29 complex, and induces conformational changes (recombinogenic hairpin structure). UL29 has been reported to contact several viral (UL9, UL12, ICP4 or ICP27) and cellular proteins (Ku86 or Rad50) to carry out its multiple functions, such as viral DNA synthesis or control of viral gene expression. Once the origin is activated, the HSV-1 helicase/primase complex (UL5/UL8/UL52) is now recruited to unwind, in the presence of UL29, the duplex DNA and synthesize short RNA primers. These are necessary to initiate DNA replication by the action of DNA polymerase (UL30/UL42) joining simultaneously to UL29 and U5, completing the replicative complex.",

            "text": "A bidirectional theta-type replication model has been proposed in the initial amplification of circular DNA, which then switches to a rolling-circle replication model to generate concatemers (sequences larger-than-unit length) of the viral genome. Electronic microscopy analyses have shown that the accumulation of concatemers is highly branched, suggesting that recombination events occur as soon as newly replicated DNA is detected (Severini et al., 1996). The coordinate action of UL12 (viral exonuclease) and UL29 cleaves the newly synthesized DNA into effective units prior to packaging (Muylaert et al., 2011). Concatemers of HSV-1 genomes contain genomic inversions suggestive of strand-transfer events (Bataille and Epstein, 1994). During DNA replication, multiple random double-strand breaks are produced and these breaks are efficient initiators of homologous recombination events between inverted regions, giving rise to new reassortments of isomers. These inversion events occur during DNA replication as a consequence of the recognition of multiple origins of replication by the UL9/UL29 complex. The UL29 protein has also recombinase activity, promoting strand invasion and, together with the helicase/primase complex (UL5/UL8 and UL52), it promotes strand exchange during replication (Makhov and Griffith, 2006). Moreover, the UL12 protein stimulates recombination through a single-strand annealing mechanism between concatemers at the end of the replication process (Schumacher et al., 2012).",

Moreover, the new highly-pathogenic influenza viruses from avian origin, H5N1 (identified in Hong Kong) and H7N9 (initially detected in Shanghai), are also the result of triple reassortments. The H5N1 virus infecting humans was the result of a reassortment among a quail H9N2 strain with segment-4 (hemagglutinin, HA) from goose H5N1 and with segment-6 (neuraminidase, NA) from teal H6N1 viruses (Guan et al., 2002). The H7N9 virus also resulted from a reassortment of avian influenza viruses where HA and NA had different origins; H7N3 was recovered from ducks and H7N9 from wild birds, respectively, whereas the internal genes were closely related to H9N2, which comes from chickens (To et al., 2013). These are excellent examples of how reassortment can impact the evolution of segmented viruses, whereas homologous recombination seems to play little or no role in the evolution of influenza viruses in natural settings (Han and Worobey, 2011). An analysis of 8,307 full-length sequences of influenza A segments identified only two single recombinant sequences (Boni et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Reassortment does not require physical proximity of the parental genomes during replication. Nevertheless, two models for the assembly and packaging of RNA in budding virions have been proposed: the random incorporation model, which assumes that the virus does not differentiate among the different segments, and the selective packaging model, that results from reassortant viruses having a selective incorporation through the so-called packaging signal (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011). There is increasing evidence supporting the theory of selective incorporation, because the number of reassortant genotypes, in experimental and natural conditions, is lower than predicted from theoretical considerations. Therefore, this model suggests that some type of constrictions at the protein or genomic level must exist. However little is known about the rules underlying this process. In an approach to define the most relevant genetic fragments for the packaging of influenza segments, Marsh et al. (2007) found that 45 and 80 nucleotides in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends respectively of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene along with an internal fragment of 15 nucleotide in the same segment must be conserved for reassortment to occur. Synonymous mutations introduced in these regions of HA resulted in a 3-fold reduction of packaging. Moreover, in a recent work aimed at understanding the exchange of gene segments between two different influenza A subtypes, human H3N2 and avian H5N2, the incorporation of avian HA in a human background required the co-selection of the avian M segment or five silent mutations in the human M segment (Essere et al., 2013). This suggests that sequence-specific interactions between RNA segments drive their selective incorporation during virion assembly (Essere et al., 2013) and that such RNA\u2013RNA interactions would limit reassortment between divergent viruses.",

It has been divided into 9 subtypes (with genetic distance between them at about 10\u201325%) and more than 60 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) resulting from recombination events among different subtypes. Currently, HIV infections worldwide caused by CRFs represent around 20% of the total number (Hemelaar et al., 2011). The efficiency of recombination depends upon the length and identity of the templates (Zhang and Temin, 1994). For instance, recombination rates between two variants of different subtypes with similarities of 85% and 70% showed a 2-fold and 5-fold reduction, respectively, compared to those between variants of the same subtype (Chin et al., 2005). However, among the known CRFs, the recombinant forms between subtype B and F (BFs) disproportionately represent the highest diversity of different recombination events, even though these subtypes share higher homologies with other subtypes, suggesting that recombination among different subtypes is not random. There is also an inverse relationship between the divergence rate in the palindromic sequences and their recombination rate (Hussein et al., 2010), suggesting that, similarly to HSV-1, the secondary structure of the RNA may play an important role in the recombination in HIV-1 (Negroni and Buc, 2000).",

            "text": "Recombination in HIV is intimately linked to replication (Delviks-Frankenberry et al., 2011), because the reverse transcription involves at least two template switching events (minus-strand DNA transfer and plus-strand DNA transfer). The process of reverse transcription in HIV is very complicated (Coffin et al., 1997), and recombination likely takes place during minus-strand DNA synthesis (Onafuwa-Nuga and Telesnitsky, 2009). The model proposed to explain retroviral recombination is the dynamic copy choice model (Hwang et al., 2001), which proposes that a balance between the polymerase and RNase H activity of retrotranscriptase (RT) influences template switching. When polymerase activity is low (and displays high RNase activity) the dissociation of RT from the nascent strand of DNA increases and, consequently, the likelihood of exchanging template strands increases. Conversely, when the RNase activity is low (maintaining high RT activity), opportunities for recombination are low because the RT is linked to the growing strand. It is estimated that, during reverse transcription, the RT is dissociated from the template at least 8 times per genome (Pathak and Hu, 1997). This dissociation is responsible for 3\u201312 template switches per genome and replication cycle (Zhuang et al., 2002). Interestingly, some RT mutations involved in antiretroviral resistance, such as K65R in RT (which confers resistance to tenofovir), can also increase template switching and, subsequently, viral evolution (Nikolenko et al., 2004).",

Two hypotheses have been suggested to explain this. First, the dominance of purifying selection in some areas of the HIV-1 genome define regions where functional constrictions appear to be particularly strong (Simon-Loriere et al., 2009). Under the second hypothesis, which does not exclude the former, there might be a direct link between enhanced recombination rates and the formation of secondary RNA structure, because these RNA structures induce stops, stalling or delays in DNA synthesis, thus favouring strand invasion (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011). Interestingly, the presence or absence of the viral chaperone nucleocapsid modulates RNA secondary structure, revealing an evolutionary role for these proteins (Negroni and Buc, 2000); this effect is related to HIV-1 nucleocapsid promoting dimeric G-quartet formation (Shen et al., 2011).",

However, their performances vary depending on the amount of recombination and the genetic diversity of the dataset. In general, these methods are more accurate with increasing recombination rates and at high levels of diversity. In particular, a minimum nucleotide diversity of 5% and several recombination events are required to obtain enough statistical power for analysis (Posada et al., 2002). Viruses are characteristically capable of such features (Bowen et al., 2000, Monjane et al., 2011, Kapusinszky et al., 2012). Additionally, rate variation among sites, which can be easily observed in virus data (Worobey, 2001), can also affect the detection of recombination by increasing false positives (Worobey, 2001, Posada, 2002). As a consequence, methods that consider substitution patterns (Stephens, 1985, Gibbs et al., 2000) and rate variation among sites are more powerful than simplistic, topology-based methods that do not consider these factors (Husmeier and Wright, 2001). Homoplasy tests are recommended to analyze low diversity datasets (Bruen et al., 2006), whereas methods such as maximum chi-square (Smith, 1992) or RDP (Martin et al., 2010) are robust to high levels of diversity (Posada, 2002). Additionally, the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI), implemented in the PhiPack package (Bruen et al., 2006), can accurately distinguish recurrent mutation from recombination in a wide variety of circumstances.",

However, as previously noted, phylogenetic inference must consider the many different intricacies that the actual evolutionary processes pose (Gonz\u00e1lez-Candelas et al., 2011). In conclusion, the use of several recombination tests followed by explicit testing of phylogenetic incongruence is recommended to generate a more robust detection of recombination (Posada, 2002).",

Recombination is generally non-homogeneous along genomes (Minin et al., 2007, Monjane et al., 2011). A number of programs exist to detect recombination breakpoints (Martin et al., 2011a, Martin et al., 2011b), but some of them are more commonly used because of their high accuracy and user-friendly environment. For example, the Datamonkey web server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005) and the Hyphy package (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2005) implement the GARD algorithm (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006b), which is based on phylogenetic discordance. The program RDP3 can also detect recombination breakpoints accurately and presents a friendly graphical interface (Martin et al., 2010). Finally, the SCUEAL tool implements a phylogenetic algorithm for mapping the location of breakpoints and assigning parental sequences in recombinant strains (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2009). This method also allows for automatically subtyping viral sequences (Yabar et al., 2012).",

Here, we highlight the widely used computer programs OmegaMap (Wilson and McVean, 2006), Lamarc (Kuhner, 2006) and LDHat (McVean et al., 2004). The OmegaMap program is based on the product of approximating conditionals (PAC) likelihood (Li and Stephens, 2003) and infers population recombination rate and selection (by the nonsynonymous to synonymous rates ratio, dN/dS), allowing both estimates to vary along the sequence. Lamarc relies on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) coalescent genealogy sampler and estimates a variety of population genetic parameters such as recombination, migration and exponential growth rates. Finally, LDHat computes the likelihood function under a coalescent-based model to estimate recombination rates. Overall, the accuracy of these analytical tools depends on the amount of genetic diversity. In general, most methods are less robust under low levels of genetic diversity, with Lamarc showing the best performance in such conditions (Lopes et al., 2014).",

Importantly, ABC methods make several important assumptions, such as a total dependence on the user-specified prior distributions, the need for extensive and realistic computer simulations or informative summary statistics, which may hamper their application. An interesting example was performed by Wilson et al. (2009), in which they applied ABC to estimate recombination rates among other evolutionary parameters (such as mutation and dN/dS).

These technologies generate many short reads with associated quality values (Metzker, 2010), which are later assembled into genomes or contigs. However, the assembly of fragments may produce artifactual recombination signals with false polymorphisms (Martin et al., 2011a, Martin et al., 2011b, Prosperi et al., 2011). A methodological alternative to avoid this source of error was proposed by Johnson and Slatkin (2009). They presented a two-site composite likelihood estimator of the population recombination rate that operates on genomic assemblies, in which each sequenced fragment derives from a different individual. More recently, a variety of new strategies to accurately estimate recombination from NGS data, based on both novel experimental methodologies (Grossmann et al., 2011, Beerenwinkel et al., 2012) and Bayesian approaches have emerged (Castillo-Ramirez et al., 2012, Zhang, 2013). These strategies are expected to overcome some of the initial problems and to generate more accurate estimates of recombination rates across the genome. An example was provided by Schlub et al.

Recombination allows the movement of variants across genomes to produce new haplotypes. Therefore, recombination does not create new mutations (at the nucleotide level) but introduces new combinations of the existing ones. As a result, several mutations previously incorporated in a genomic region can be transferred simultaneously to another region by a single recombination event. Interestingly, at the codon level, recombination can also alter the codon state by intra-codon recombination events (Arenas and Posada, 2010a), a process observed in viruses (Behura and Severson, 2013). Nevertheless, the fate of these genetic changes will be ultimately determined by natural selection and genetic drift.",

In particular, recombination increases the number of false positively selected sites (PSS) (Anisimova et al., 2003, Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006a, Arenas and Posada, 2010a). By contrast, this effect was not observed in the estimation of dN/dS at the global level (entire sequence) even when intra-codon recombination was present (Arenas and Posada, 2010a, Arenas and Posada, 2012). Consequently, recombination should be taken into account when estimating local dN/dS. A proposed methodology to perform this task \u2013 implemented in Datamonkey and Hyphy\n\u2013 starts with the detection of recombination breakpoints, followed by the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree for each recombinant fragment and, finally, the estimation of dN/dS by using the appropriate tree for each region (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006a) (Fig. 2\n).

Factors like the diversity level of the viral strains (Vidal et al., 2000), sampling procedure (samples should be as representative as possible of the viral population), or the computational design of the centralized genes (Arenas and Posada, 2010b) seem to impact the performance of the centralized genes strategy.",

Moreover, Arenas and Posada (2010c) have shown that recombination incorporates errors in the estimation of ANC sequences and such errors may influence the prediction of ancestral epitopes and N-glycosylation sites. These authors also showed that recombination affects the estimation of COT sequences, although its impact is less severe in the estimation of ANC sequences (Arenas and Posada, 2010b). Consequently, recombination should be always considered when estimating centralized sequences.

Usually, there is a geographic range within which individual particles are more closely related to one another than those randomly selected from the general population. This is described as the extent to which the viral population is genetically structured. This can be assessed quantitatively through population differentiation coefficients (Meirmans and Hedrick, 2011). If viral particles are sampled at random from a population where viruses freely disperse among hosts (no population structure), then two sampled copies are expected to follow predictable proportions which only depend on the overall allele frequencies of the population (Gillespie, 2004). However, if viruses are distributed in patches (population structure), the particles found in different areas will follow a different proportion than that predicted by the global allele frequencies. The main effect of population structuring would be an apparent excess of samplings with two exact copies of the same RNA genome and a deficit of cases with different RNA genome copies. This relationship between the departure from random combinations of genetic variants and population structure is known as the Wahlund effect (Hartl and Clark, 2007).",

When the alleles present at one locus are independent of those present at a second locus, the viral population is said to be at linkage equilibrium. However, if a particular allele at one locus is found on the same chromosome with a specific allele at a second locus more (or less) often than expected under independent segregation then these loci are in linkage disequilibrium (LD). When real examples are considered, different viral haplotypes (combinations of alleles or genetic markers) are rarely distributed as conveniently as expected under random mixing of alleles (Verschoor et al., 2004). In many cases, some viral haplotypes appear more often than expected under linkage equilibrium, so that accounting for LD becomes of great importance when making inferences about recombination in natural populations.",

The effective recombination rate in natural populations is dependent on the effective population size and population stochasticity may impact the efficiency of recombination (McVean et al., 2002). Indeed, Frost et al. (2000) found that differences in the rate of evolution of lamivudine resistance between infected individuals arose through genetic drift affecting the relative frequency of different genetic variants prior to therapy. Their results showed that stochastic effects can be significant in HIV evolution, even when there are large fitness differences between mutant and wild-type variants. Epistatic interactions between genetic variants in different loci may also counteract the effect of recombination over allele combinations.

Although the re-circularization of linear DNA has not demonstrated experimentally, several lines of evidence suggest that it must occur. Three ori sites are the distributed along the DNA genome (2 oriS and 1 oriL), but in this figure we only show the interaction of the replication complex with one site. In the oriS (45 bp) there are two fragments with high affinity to UL9 (box1 and box2) characterized by the sequence TTCGCAC, whereas in oriL (144 bp) two box1 are present. It has been suggested that these origins may function differently during lytic and latent infection.",

(1) Given a coding DNA alignment, recombination breakpoints can be detected, for example with GARD (HyPhy, Datamonkey web server) or RDP3. Partition alignments can be produced by splitting the original alignment according to the recombination breakpoints. (2) A substitution model can be selected for each partition alignment using for example jModelTest (Posada 2008) or HyPhy. (3) Given the substitution model, a phylogenetic tree can be reconstructed for each partition alignment. (4) Finally, the dN/dS estimation at each codon site can be performed by using the corresponding partition alignment and its substitution model and phylogenetic tree. This whole procedure has been implemented in the Datamonkey web server.",
