Indeed the very word \"dis-ease\" implies a state lacking \"ease\" or well-being. We feel it is important to consider disease holistically: that is to consider the animal's ability to resist stress and the environmental challenges it faces. Whereas the outcome of poor welfare is expressed as disease, the relative contributions of various stressors will vary with each individual. The other chapters consider genetics, nutrition and environment in terms of the welfare of poultry. However, given the same housing, air, feed and water, some birds may become diseased and some remain healthy. Intrinsic biological variation results in a range of nutrient reserves and immune status at hatching, plus differences in genetic make up, social status and behaviour that interact with each other and further factors to provide different outcomes for the individual. In the pragmatic world of farming, flock health status may be frequently chosen as the index of welfare, but it is important not to lose sight of the health and well-being of each individual, even in flocks numbering tens of thousands of birds.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 87, "text": "(Broom, 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "For the individual animal, it matters not whether any disease it suffers from is common or rare, is created by systems it lives in, or by natural susceptibility to the disease.

The livers of laying hens become putty coloured owing to contents of up to 70% lipid (mostly triglyceride) and they also haemorrhage. Excessive abdominal fat is seen, and the kidneys are often pale and swollen. Mortality is generally low, but morbidity high and egg production may fall. Scheele (1997) noted that the condition was the most important disease of laying hens in the Netherlands. It is more common in caged layers which cannot exercise to use up the excess energy. When formulating diets for birds it is important to realise that their carbohydrate and lipid metabolism differs from mammals.

Reduced bone strength is however, virtually ubiquitous, to some degree, in modern strains of layers that are managed for high egg output. Osteoporosis is a reduced mineralisation of the main structural bones of the skeleton which weakens them, leading to torsion (particularly of the keel bone) and to fractures. The birds are unable to obtain sufficient calcium from the diet or by release from medullary bones (which act as calcium reservoirs) to form the egg shells and so they mobilise skeletal calcium. The skeleton becomes increasingly weak as lay progresses, and older birds are more likely to suffer \"cage layer fatigue\" in which, as well as widespread bone abnormality, paralysis occurs due to nerve damage from weakened bones in the vertebral column.

(1992) , that assigns a gait score (GS) from 0 (normal, fully mobile and agile) to 5 (incapable of walking) based on visual appraisal by humans of the gait of a broiler that is encouraged to walk. With trained and standardised assessors, and with an appropriate sample of broilers (Kestin and Knowles, 2003) , the method can estimate the distribution of gait scores in a commercial flock -or in other words, the magnitude and severity of lameness. The prevalent opinion is that broilers with a gait score of 3, 4 or 5 have increasingly compromised welfare. On this basis, recent surveys have estimated the proportion of broilers affected (GS>2) to be 2.5% (Knowles et al., 2008) , 14.8% (Berg and Sanotra, 2001 , a pilot study in Sweden of 400 broilers in 8 flocks at 29-33 days of age), 30.1% , a survey in Denmark of 2,800 broilers in 28 flocks at 31-42 days of age). There are a number of possible explanations for such widely differing estimates of the prevalence of lameness in broilers. One is inter-observer reliability, and the inevitable inaccuracies associated with a subjective method of evaluation. This can be overcome to a large degree by training, validation and the use of standards (such as a large reference database on videotape of the locomotion of broilers of each different gait score).

Principal among these is increased susceptibility to lameness, although this varies slightly between genotypes (Kestin et al., 1992 . A survey of leg problems in commercial broiler flocks in Sweden found the proportion of lame broilers (gait scores >2) was significantly greater (P<0.001) in Cobb genotypes, at 26.1%, than Ross 208 genotypes, at 14.1% . Several studies have shown that high levels of lameness are significantly associated with high growth rate and precociously heavy body weight, and Kestin et al. (2001) demonstrated this across a particularly wide variety of genotypes ( Fig. 8.1 ). Previous studies (Kestin, 1992 , Sorensen et al., 2000 have also shown that both the proportion of broilers affected by lameness, and the severity of lameness, increases with age. As would be expected in growing broilers, weight also generally increases with age, but this only applies to birds that can still walk and have adequate access to feed and water (up to GS 3). Those birds classified as GS 4 or 5 are unable to gain adequate access to feed and water, and in consequence their growth is impaired ( Fig. 8.2 ). Clearly the health and welfare of such very lame broilers is so poor that they should be culled, and good producers will have a thorough culling programme.

It is important to note that many of these affect liveweight and that often any benefits are due primarily to this weight reduction. Thus, to determine whether changes have a value per se, correction must be made for alterations in body weight. Lameness increases in prevalence and severity with increasing stocking density (Hall, 2001; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2000) . The free floor space available for exercise decreases with increasing stocking density and could account for some of the increase in lameness. Several studies support the hypothesis that reduced exercise increases leg problems (Reiter and Bessei, 1998; Bizeray et al., 2000) . The effects of light on broiler welfare are complex, however certain lighting patterns may reduce the incidence of leg disorders (reviewed by Gordon, 1994; Sorensen et al., 1999) . Improvements in leg health may be due both to the stimulation of bouts of activity and also to periods of high quality rest and improved metabolic health (Gordon, 1994) . This explanation could equally apply to the reported benefits of providing feed in meals rather than ad libitum . To reduce leg problems effectively, feed restriction generally has to be severe enough to cause long-term growth reduction whether applied for short periods at a young age in broilers (e.g. Su et al., 1999) or throughout life in broiler parent stocks. It then becomes difficult to balance the resultant welfare benefits with the welfare problems. In the case of broilers other methods should preferably be employed to improve leg health.

The history of NDV is marked by global panzootics in which disease spreads across the world, with the initial occurrence in all cases in the far or Middle East. It is suggested that NDV may spread over huge distances as an aerosol, although this has never been clearly demonstrated. Human and bird vectors are more likely to have been the disseminators of disease in all recent outbreaks. Racing pigeons are vaccinated against paramyxovirus 1, and exotic birds are quarantined to help prevent international spread. The NDV viruses are very persistent, surviving for several weeks at low ambient temperatures (Alexander et al., 1998) . Vaccination is the cornerstone of protection from NDV for intensive poultry production, and in terms of animal welfare, NDV provides a good example of vaccination as a valuable tool in protecting animal welfare. Some people might argue that it is the intensive nature of poultry production that creates the potential international movement of the NDV, and creates the conditions in which huge numbers of birds are \"at risk\" within the same airspace or on the same site.

However modern, intensively stocked floor-rearing systems, especially of breeders, results in such a high challenge that Coccidiosis frequently ensues. Coccidiosis is controllable by three possible artificial mechanisms, vaccination, removal from the body using cocccidiocides, or reduction of the worst effects of Coccidiosis by use of pharmaceutical products called coccidiostats which inhibit the parasite. Vaccination is a comparatively recent method for coccidian control, with live attenuated precocious oocysts from a range of Eimeria lines being given orally. Coccidiocides are used in pigeons, and occasionally in small groups of poultry to attempt elimination of coccidia, but by far the most common method for control of Coccidiosis worldwide at present is the use of coccidiostats. A number of compounds have coccidiostatic properties including, inonophores, quinolone antibiotics, nitrobenzamides, carbanilide, and the sulphonamide antibiotics. Over time, the efficacy of many coccidiostats has reduced as coccidial resistance has developed. The cost of these agents, and the changes in sensitivity of the coccidian to the agents means that control of Coccidiosis relies on a combination of management (hygiene, site depopulation and cleaning), treatment with coccidiostats, selection for birds with reduced susceptibility to Coccidiosis and vaccination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Anti-coccidials"}, {"text": "The use of coccidostat drugs to control the disease has two main disadvantages: the need for a withdrawal period before both meat and eggs can be used for human consumption and the increasing resistance of the parasite to drugs.

Such vaccines are usually accepted for organic production. While they can replace the use of coccidiostat drugs in feed, many authorities recommend an integrated approach where both are used (Chapman, 2000) . It is hoped that this will combat the increasing resistance to coccidiostats of the parasites. Other approaches to improving the efficacy of coccidiostats, such as the use of betaine, which helps to preserve the integrity of the intestines and to reduce lesions, are being explored (Bedford, 2000) .
