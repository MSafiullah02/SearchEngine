Children learn from their parents\u2019 different social norms, values, and skills such as how to interact with people, in order to develop their own personality. Parsons thinks that children in the family learn from their parents the key elements of their own future parenthood, through the process of socialization (Parsons 1955). As Fig. 26.1 shows, the son learns to play the \u201cinstrumental\u201d, economic, or problem-solving role to become a father. The daughter learns the \u201cexpressive\u201d, emotional, caring role to become a mother.\n",

The ideal homes in the children\u2019s minds are not homes in the eyes of the adults. By drawing \u201cnon-family homes\u201d as ideal homes the children are expressing dissatisfaction with their families in real life. These \u201cnon-realistic\u201d ideas represent their criticism of, and discontents with, family members, the Home, family, reality, life, and living.",

In that kind of \u201charmonious\u201d family atmosphere, all problems, resentment, and traumas cannot make their appearance. They are suppressed, repressed, shut out of consiousness and memory. As a result, what we see is a happy family photo, in which every member reveals a face that smiles, for the benefit of the outsiders and the insiders, while private bitterness is hidden away in the heart. Society has taught all of us through socialization to play the happy family game (Laing 1971).",

The characteristic of children\u2019s drawing is that their view of objects and events is pure and innocent and expressed very sincerely. They look at objects and events with \u201can innocent eye\u201d, and put their internal feelings on the drawing paper, by way of images untainted by reason and driven by subjective emotions and feelings.",

If we are prepared to put aside the adult perspective, and to open our eyes to see what children\u2019s drawings are really telling us, we will know that children have bad feelings about the down and dark side of their family. We will then learn of their grievances against family members, their dissatisfaction with the family home, their place in it, their reality: The drawings of children tell only one thing: the truth.\n",

When children draw, they do not follow the outer appearance of the object; instead they draw the image in their mind according to their own perspective. Children\u2019s drawings reflect their internal world. Knowing how to read children\u2019s drawings means finding the door or window to the inner secrets of children. So starting with children\u2019s drawings, and assisted by their own explanations, we can find out what they think about their family, and about themselves. If children\u2019s drawings are viewed in chronological order, they can be read as an epic of the life process. This epic is beautiful, splendid, full of fancies and miracles, and reveals the happenings in each and every stage of the child\u2019s development. In this epic we encounter the physiological and psychological story, the conflict within the individual, conflict between individuals, conflict between self and society. When carefully reading these children\u2019s drawings, which reflect their life process, we will notice the spindrift resulting from different kinds of conflict. It not only covers a wide range, but also involves individual orientations and forces constantly shifting between concealment and conspicuousness, strength and weakness, joy and sorrow. New-born babies are like a blank piece of paper, but society, parent-child relationships, and the family write on it, constructing babies\u2019 biographies and trajectories. May all the parents in the world be able to make good use of children\u2019s drawing as key to the inner yearning, needs, and desires of children and understand their inner world.",
