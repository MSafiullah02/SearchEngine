Three independent sets of data exemplify the two kinds of memory in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The data provide evidence of re-emergence of sequences that were hidden in cellular or anatomical compartments for extended periods of infection, and recovery of a quasispecies from pre-existing genomes.

Integrated DNA copies of the HIV-1 genome constitute a reservoir of viral sequences that upon cellular activation can contribute new mutant distributions to the replicating pool of the virus. 11, 12 Several anatomical compartments (including lymph nodes) and cell types (resting CD4\u00fe lymphocytes, macrophages, and others) are potential reservoirs for HIV-1. 14 -16 Viruses in reservoirs can evolve more slowly than those circulating in the plasma of the same patient, and they can maintain for months or years the genotype exhibited when they entered the reservoir. This genotype can be either wild-type or drug-resistant, independent of the genotype currently dominant in the plasma. 17, 18 Integrated proviruses are not affected by the selective pressure of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI), whilst their expression, following activation of the host lymphocyte, may be sensitive to protease inhibitors (PRI). 11, 12 Also, some anatomical sites may provide a barrier to the antiretroviral pressure, due to limited access of some drugs (i.e. PRI). 17, 18 Viruses from such reservoirs could reemerge and occupy the circulating quasispecies as documented by phylogenetic analyses of consensus sequences. 19 Re-emergence could be a consequence of structured treatment interruptions. 20 -22 Figure 1 shows a flux diagram of HIV-1 infection that takes into account the different cellular types that contribute to (and can represent sources of) memory in the circulating HIV-1 quasispecies (quantitative data 23 -28 ).

The possible contribution of non-replicative (reservoir) memory was studied by means of sequence analysis of retrospective viral samples from two patients (cases 1 and 2). Consensus nucleotide sequences were used to deduce the amino acid substitutions present at each codon of the protease (PR) and the first 220 codons of the RT (Table 2 ). Sequential HIV-1 sequences from case 1 showed a progressive accumulation of resistance mutations after a five year exposure to AZT (in monotherapy from April 1992 to December 1995, and in combination with ddI until May 1997). This accumulation of nucleoside-resistance mutations ( Table 2 ) led to selection of multinucleoside-resistant genomes encoding the insertion T69SSS in sample 5.97. The shift to a HAART combination (d4T \u00fe 3TC \u00fe RTV) resulted in the absence of this insert-containing genotype in a sample collected only two months later. Interestingly, this sample (7.97) and the following one (3.98) exhibited a mutation pattern in the RT very close to that of the first available sample of this patient (11.94). HIV-1 proviral DNA collected in August 1998 conserved some of the mutations found in the RT-coding region prior to May 1997. The re-emergence of the initial genotype is not evident for the consensus sequence of the PR-coding region, although a shift to a consensus sequence lacking the key substitutions N37S and R41K was observed in sample 7.97 ( Table 2 ). The different behaviour of the RT and PR genes could be due to the absence of a selective pressure acting on the PR, resulting in their independent evolution, or to intra-patient recombination events. Different phylogenetic approaches were used to analyse consecutive consensus sequences in order to evaluate the possibility of a re-emergence of viruses that could have been hidden in cellular or anatomical compartments from November 1994 until July 1997. NJ, UPGMA, MP and ML methods produced the same overall tree topology for consensus sequences of pol and env regions (Figure 2 (a) and (b)). The phylogenetic relationships are highly consistent and show a clear separation between two groups of isolates: 7.95/12.95/9.96/5.97/8.98-DNA (genomes with a progressive accumulation of nucleoside analog-resistance mutations, and the proviral sequence), and 11.94/7.97/3.98 (the ancestral genome and those present after its re-emergence).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 362, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 696, "end": 704, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 989, "end": 996, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1785, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 2362, "end": 2371, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Case 2 was a patient with a poor adherence to treatment, who showed large fluctuations in viral load as a response to different HAART regimes during the period of study (Table 1) .

The amino acid substitutions in PR and RT suggested the occurrence of two progressive re-emergence events. Sample 8.98 would be the result of the re-emergence of viruses related to those in sample 10.97 (with some definitory amino acid replacements, such as V32I and V82A in the PR, and K70R and K122E in the RT), and sample 9.98 would result from the re-emergence of sequences from sample 1.98 (with signature substitutions L10I, I62V, G73S, I84V and L90M at the PR, and M41L and L210W at the RT). Most of these amino acid replacements are related to drug resistance to PRI or RTI. 29, 30 A phylogenetic analysis of the sequential consensus sequences using MP, NJ, UPGMA and ML indicated isomorphic topologies for pol and env in all cases (Figure 2 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1005, "end": 1008, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1009, "end": 1011, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 178, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 403, "end": 418, "text": "(Tables 1 and 2", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1171, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Apart from non-replicative memory due to re-emergence from cellular or anatomic compartments, a replicative memory could also exist in retroviruses, analogous to that previously documented in FMDV. 6 -9 To evaluate the possible presence of replicative memory in HIV-1, a detailed phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequential clonal sequences from case 3. In this patient, key mutations in HIV-1 related to decreased sensitivity to inhibitors were maintained at all time points, yet dominance of genomes encoding the RT insertion T69SSS was lost within a six month interval (from January to June 1995), probably as a result of the switch from AZT \u00fe ddC treatment to ddI monotherapy. The re-introduction of AZT (in combination with 3TC) was associated with selection (from June to August 1995) of a virus whose consensus sequence contained the RT insert ( Table 2) .

Most (about 90%) of the CD4\u00fe lymphocytes are infected with defective viruses, and they do not contribute to the circulating quasispecies.

In the particular case of dynamics of HIV-1 in vivo such selective pressure can be identified with an antiviral treatment, so that 1 is sensitive to the treatment, whereas 2 is resistant. This corresponds to the situation k 2 \u00bc 1:0 . k 1 : After a short period d, that is, at t 2 \u00fe d; the selective pressure is withdrawn, expecting to recover k 1 \u00bc 1:0 . k 2 ; with k 2 at t 2 \u00fe d being larger than the initial k 2 value at t 0 ; which means that component 2 has become fitter. With these new values for k 1 and k 2 we let the system evolve to a sufficient late time t 3 : At t 3 ; n 1 \u00f0t 3 \u00de and n 2 \u00f0t 3 \u00de have reached their new quasispecies values (as the value of the constants has changed).

The evolution from t 3 to t 4 is characterized by these quasispecies values. At a later time t 4 we apply a second selective pressure (a different antiviral treatment), which favours a new component 3 to move from a reservoir to the bloodstream (thus the circulating quasispecies includes now three components). We assume that component 1 is sensitive to the treatment, components 2 and 3 are resistant, and 3 is fitter than 2 (this is the reason why component 3 has moved from a reservoir compartment to the bloodstream), so k 3 \u00bc 1:0 . k 2 . k 1 : If this second treatment is maintained after t 4 ; component 3 will remain the majority in the quasispecies, and will be recognized as the consensus sequence. This corresponds to the situation reported for cases 1 and 2, where the re-emergence of ancestral \"component 3\" genomes was detected as the consensus sequence, following a long dominance of \"component 1\" genomes. If we discontinue this second treatment at a time t 4 \u00fe d; the system will recover the fitness ratio k 1 \u00bc 1:0 . k 3 . k 2 and, at a later time t 5 ; sufficient for the system to reach its steady-state, we will obtain new quasispecies values for this set of parameters: n 1 \u00f0t 5 \u00de; n 2 \u00f0t 5 \u00de and n 3 \u00f0t 5 \u00de: The quasispecies level n 3 \u00f0t 5 \u00de=k would correspond to the contribution of non-replicative (or reservoir) components to the quasispecies memory.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quantitative model of quasispecies dynamics involving replicative and non-replicative memory"}, {"text": "We have run three numerical computations corresponding to three different values of the mutation rate, namely m \u00bc 10 23 ; 10 24 and 10 25 .

Case 1 documented the re-emergence of viral genomes that could have been hidden in cellular or anatomical body compartments for 32 months. These memory viruses lacked all the nucleoside resistance mutations, including the insertion T69SSS, that had progressively accumulated in the circulating quasispecies. The introduction of a potent HAART regime (d4T \u00fe 3 TC \u00fe RTV) would have eliminated most of the circulating viruses while ancestral, probably fitter, viruses would have moved from the reservoirs to the bloodstream. A previous clonal analysis 51 did not provide evidence that minority members of the replicating quasispecies survived the treatment, although such minority could have been below the detection level of the analysis.
