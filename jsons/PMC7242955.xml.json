Individuals with diabetes have been declared as being a vulnerable group. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the emerging information (up till time of writing) on individuals with diabetes and COVID-19, why individuals with diabetes are considered as vulnerable and what measures have been recommended for this population to date.",

Consequently there is an increased exposure of healthcare workers to the COVID-19 positive individual.6 Furthermore, in the presence of respiratory distress these individuals will also require mechanical ventilation which further increases the risk of aerosolisation of the viral particles.",

It is responsible for the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver.26 Historically, metformin was initially produced as an anti-influenza drug and its well-known glucose lowering ability was actually a side effect.27 It has been postulated that metformin may have an advantageous role in this pandemic. The activation of AMPK by metformin leads to phosphorylation of ACE2 which can lead to functional changes to this receptor.28 Such changes may decrease the binding of SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that if the virus enters into the host cells through ACE2, it creates an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with downregulation of ACE2 receptors. However, metformin prevents this detrimental sequence by activation of ACE2 through the AMPK-signalling pathway.29 Therefore, one can postulate that there is no contraindication for the intake of metformin if an individual with diabetes gets infected by COVID-19. On the contrary it might be beneficial to these individuals during this pandemic.",

The GLP-1Ra and SGLT-2 inhibitors have additional roles in the prevention of kidney and cardiovascular disease. Such roles have an additional benefit during this pandemic, where it is reported that individuals suffering from any of the aforementioned diseases have a worse prognosis if infected by COVID-19.30 Additionally, GLP-1Ra also has anti-inflammatory and anti-adipogenic effects with insulin resistance antagonism.31 However, considering that both GLP-1Ra and SGLT-2 inhibitors may induce ACE2 receptor over-expression,32 these drugs may have more serious consequences if individuals with diabetes acquire COVID-19. More data and clinical studies are required to ascertain such a relationship. Of note, in those not infected by COVID-19 but on SGLT-2 inhibitors, an increased risk of diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) has been observed. This will further complicate the clinical scenario should they acquire the virus.33 Similarly, individuals with type 1 diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors and infected by COVID-19 have been observed to experience severe DKA.34 It has been recommended that individuals with diabetes infected by COVID-19 should have their SGLT2 inhibitors discontinued as a precaution against potential acute metabolic decompensation.34\n",

These are associated with an increased ACE2 expression with a counteractive response to the elevated levels of angiotensin-II. The ARBs have pleiotropic effects beyond controlling hypertension. They have anti-inflammatory effects, reduce endothelial injury and organ fibrosis, maintain insulin sensitivity as well as energy metabolism. Additionally, ARBs have a protective effect on lipid metabolism and normalise the coagulation cascade.39\n,\n40 It has also been reported that ARBs protect the lungs from severe endothelial injury associated with pneumonia, influenza and sepsis.41 During this pandemic there have been reports that individuals with diabetes on ACE inhibitors (ACEi) are at an increased susceptibility to COVID-19.18\n,\n42 It has been postulated that when SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a host receptor, the ACE2 gets downregulated and compromises its protection to the lung tissue from injury.18 However, there is lack of robust data and evidence on this malice relationship. In fact, the Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology, along with a consortium between the American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America and the American College of Cardiology, all recommended that physicians should continue the treatment and any medication changes should only be done after careful assessment. This is especially so, when considering that ARBs have a number of protective effects.43., 44., 45. It has been noted that those infected with COVID-19 had hypokalaemia, which has been linked with the downregulation effect of ACE2 within the lungs.18 This causes a reduction in angiotensin-II degradation with a consequential increased secretion of aldosterone. The presence of hypokalaemia can worsen the glycaemic control in both individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.46\n",

Some countries are also broadcasting a daily exercise routine for their viewers to follow. Individuals with diabetes are recommended to follow such exercise programmes however the exercise intensity should be tailored to the individual's capacity to exercise. Another important factor is for individuals with diabetes to adhere to a regular well-balanced diet. A healthy diet should consist of protein, fiber, vitamins and limited saturated fats. In this time of lockdown, acquiring fresh fruit and vegetables may be a challenge however there are companies that are delivering such fresh foods directly to residents' homes. Unfortunately, during this stressful time of the pandemic, an individual may opt for inappropriate stress eating habits, with a tendency towards packed high fat, sugar and salt content foods. Such food along with lack of physical activity is the recipe for dysregulation of the blood glucose levels, hyperosmolar coma, ketoacidosis, predisposition to infections as well as acute cardiac events in individuals with diabetes.6 A number of doctors have set up telemedicine as an exchange for their normal consultation practices. Through the means of telemedicine, individuals with diabetes can remain in constant contact with their physician for treatment advise and management of their glucose levels.34\n",
