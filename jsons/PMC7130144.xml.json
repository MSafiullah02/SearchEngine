It has infected over 8000 people and caused more than 900 deaths (Hong Kong SARS Expert Committee (HKSARSEC), 2003). In the early days of the outbreak, the source and mode of transmission were unknown (HKSARSEC, 2003). Older adults and the chronically ill were particularly susceptible to SARS with a disproportionably large number of deaths occurring in these groups (HKSARS, 2003). The emerging nature of SARS has meant that there are few studies that have explored the perceptions of the Hong Kong community as they have passed through this crisis. The aim of the study is to describe the knowledge about SARS and precautionary measures taken by older adults in Hong Kong.",

Clinical features of SARS at the prodrome stage include: (1) incubation period usually 2\u20137 days; (2) fever (>38\u00b0C); (3) chills and rigors; and (4) other symptoms including headache, malaise, and myalgias may appear. At the later stage, respiratory symptoms including dry and non-productive cough, dyspnoea, and hypoxemia, may occur. Chest radiographs may show pneumonic changes such as signs of infiltration and consolidation (WHO, n.d.). It was determined that SARS was mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets or by direct contact with an infected person's secretions (Hong Kong Department of Health (HKDH), 2003).",

It gained to public awareness through the Hong Kong news media on 10 February 2003 as an atypical pneumonia outbreak in a nearby province (Guangdong) in Southeastern Mainland China. The outbreak began in Hong Kong on 21 February 2003, when an infected professor from Mainland China (the index case) arrived with his wife; they stayed in a local hotel (HKSARSEC, 2003). One day after his arrival, he was admitted to a hospital in Hong Kong with severe pneumonia and subsequently died. This hotel was later identified as the original Hong Kong site from which local and international (Hanoi, Singapore, and Toronto) transmission occurred (HKSARSEC, 2003). The first hospital outbreak began on 10 March 2003 when 11 healthcare staff was reported on sick leave from a public hospital. Outbreaks in other hospitals and a housing complex were also identified in April. (Major events in the SARS epidemic were summarized in Table 1\n.) On 2 April 2003, WHO issued travel advisory against travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (Mainland China). WHO removed Hong Kong from the SARS list on 23 June 2003 (HKSARSEC, 2003). Over the course of the outbreak, 1755 cases were reported including 300 deaths. Adults 65 years of age or older were 17.6% of the SARS cases; however, 63.9% of the deaths were within this age demographic and 78.2% of the deaths in this population were persons with a history of chronic illnesses (The University of Hong Kong Clinical Trial Centre (HKUCTC), 26 October 2003).",

In other words, only a small portion of the older adults received higher levels of education (HKCSD, 26 October 2001a).

The Department of Health operates the Elderly Health Services, which provides primary health care and health promotion for older adults once they enroll (HKDH, 2001). The annual enrolment fee is HK$110 (i.e. US$14.10/UK\u00a3 10.00) and curative services cost HK$45 (i.e., US$5.77/UK\u00a3 4.09) per consultation. Older adults may also go to the Hospital Authority's General Outpatient Clinic (GOPC) for medical advice and treatment (Hong Kong Hospital Authority, n.d.). At the GOPC, the treatments including X-rays and laboratory cost HK$45 (i.e. US$5.77/UK\u00a3 4.09) and medications cost only HK$10 (i.e. US$1.28/UK\u00a3 0.91).

Precautionary measures to prevent the transmission of SARS related to personal hygiene and environmental sanitation were publicized daily in the media as a way to minimize the possibility of becoming infected with SARS. The presence of functional impairments resulting from chronic illnesses or knowledge deficits due to low literacy levels may have influenced what older adults were able to do to comply with the recommended infection control measures. Thus, great concern about older adults living alone was expressed by health care providers and in the media (Kong, 2003). Older adults, who may not have reacted promptly and appropriately to the Government's recommendations to prevent the transmission of SARS, could have been at higher risk for contracting SARS and potentially for presenting a higher risk of transmission to others. Understanding older adults\u2019 knowledge level and adherence to the government's recommended precautionary measures to prevent transmission of SARS is an essential step in being able to design similar promotion programmes for this population in the future. The research questions examined in this study were:(1)What demographic variables influenced older adults\u2019 knowledge level, beliefs, and precautionary measures taken to prevent transmission of SARS?(2)What was the knowledge level of older adults about the transmission routes of SARS?(3)What were the beliefs of older adults about the possibility of becoming infected with SARS?(4)What precautionary measures were taken by older adults to prevent the transmission of SARS?(5)Does the level of knowledge or beliefs about SARS affect the types of precautionary measures used by older adults?\n",

The participants indicated how often they had implemented eight precautionary measures (e.g., wearing a face mask, covering your mouth when sneezing) during the past 3 days. Three of the questions asked were about hand washing behaviours (after sneezing/coughing, after touching possibly contaminated materials and the use of liquid soap instead of bar soap). The remaining three items asked about behaviours that are traditionally practised in Hong Kong, which required some alternation to avoid spread of SARS. For example, sharing dishes at meals is common in the Chinese culture. Use serving spoon or chopsticks, rather than each individual each using their own chopsticks to take food from commonly shared dishes was recommended as a precautionary measure, but is not widely used (HKDH, 29 November, 2003). Another common practice is to leave the toilet seat up while flushing; however, contact with urine or feaces is one of the transmission routes, so lowering the toilet cover before flushing may prevent contaminated water from splashing out (HKDH, 29 November, 2003). Thirdly, a common serving towel is often used during meals and this practice may also transmit the disease. A 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (always) to 4 (none) and a choice of \u201cdo not know\u201d was added for the participants who did not know how to answer the questions.",

Throughout the outbreak, the main route of transmission was a direct contact of the mucous membrane (eyes, nose, and mouth) with infectious respiratory droplets (Weekly epidemiological record, 24 October, 2003). Under certain circumstances, contact with urine or feaces was also reported as another route of transmission. The public awareness about the \u201cfecal droplet\u201d as a transmission route of SARS was increased after the community outbreak in a private housing complex in Hong Kong (Inadequate plumbing systems, 26 September, 2003). The WHO technical consultation concluded that inadequate plumbing systems also contributed to the spread of infectious diseases (Inadequate plumbing systems, 26 September, 2003). Therefore, it was essential to maintain good plumbing systems and take appropriate precautionary measures such as to lower the toilet lid before flushing. However, insufficient knowledge about transmission route of SARS may have affected participants\u2019 awareness of adequate precautionary measures. This was evidenced by more than half of the participants reporting that they did not lower the toilet lid before flushing. Although feacal droplet transmission has been less commonly identified as the main transmission route among the infected cases when compared with respiratory droplet transmission (The University of Hong Kong, n.d.), insufficient knowledge among the older adults could have led to a higher risk of contracting SARS. It is important for those who develop public health messages during crisis situations, such as the one SARS presented in Hong Kong, to identify vulnerable populations that may not be literate and to target health promotion messages in appropriate methods, which have a high probability of reaching these populations.",
