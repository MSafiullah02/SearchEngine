By minimizing the closely physical contact between people, we can reduce chances of catching the virus and spreading it to the community. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how emerging technologies, e.g., wireless and networking, AI can enable, encourage, and even enforce social distancing. To that end, we provide a fundamental background of social distancing including basic concepts, measurements, models and propose practical scenarios. We then discuss enabling wireless technologies which are especially effective and can be widely adopted in practice to keep distance and monitor people. After that, emerging technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g., symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact tracing. Finally, we provide important open issues and challenges (e.g., privacy-preserving, cybersecurity) in implementing social distancing in practice.",

Within only four months (from January to April 2020), 210 countries and territories around the world have reported more than three million infected people including more than two hundred thousand deaths [1] . Beside the global health crisis, COVID-19 has also been causing massive economic losses (e.g., a possible 25% unemployment rate in the U.S. [2] , one million people lost their jobs in Canada during March 2020 [3] , 1.4 million jobs lost in Australia [4] , and a projected global 3% GDP loss [5] ), resulting in a global recession as predicted by many experts [5] - [7] . In such context, there is an urgent need for solutions to contain the disease spread, thereby reducing its negative impacts and buying more time for pharmaceutical solution development.",

            "text": "In the presence of contagious diseases such as SARS, H1N1, and COVID-19, social distancing is an effective nonpharmaceutical approach to limit the disease transmission [8] , [20] , [27] . Social distancing refers to the measures that reduce the disease spread by reducing the frequency and closeness of human physical contacts, such as closing public places (e.g, schools, workplaces), avoiding mass gatherings, and keeping a sufficient distance amongst people [8] , [9] . By reducing the probability that the disease can be transmitted from an infected person to a healthy one, social distancing can significantly reduce the disease's spread and severity. If implemented properly at the early stages of a pandemic, social distancing measures can play a key role in reducing the infection rate and delay the disease's peak, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and lowering death rates [8] , [20] , [27] . Fig. 1 illustrates the effects of social distancing measures on the daily number of cases [11] . As can be observed in Fig. 1(a) , social distancing can reduce the peak number of infected cases [27] to ensure that the number of patients does not exceed the public healthcare capacity. Moreover, social distancing also delays the outbreak peak [27] so that there is more time to implement countermeasures. Furthermore, social distancing can reduce the final number of infected cases [27] , and the earlier social distancing is implemented, the higher the effects will be as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) [11] .",

Nevertheless, such aggressive and large-scale measures are not easy to implement, e.g., not all public spaces can be closed, and people still have to go outside for food, healthcare, or essential work. In such context, technologies play a key role in facilitating social distancing measures. For example, wireless positioning systems can effectively help people to keep a safe distance by measuring the distances between people and alerting them when they are too close to each other. Moreover, other technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to facilitate or even enforce social distancing.",

Social Distancing 1) Definition and Classifications: Social distancing refers to the non-pharmaceutical measures to reduce the frequency of physical contacts and the contact distances between people during an infectious disease outbreak [10] . Social distancing methods can be classified into public and individual measures. Public measures include closing or reducing access to education institutions and workplaces, canceling mass gatherings, travel restrictions, border control, and quarantining buildings. Individual measures consist of isolation, quarantine, and encouragement to keep physical distances between people [9] . Although these measures can cause some negative impacts on the economy and individual freedom, they play a crucial role in reducing the severity of a pandemic [10] . If implemented properly, social distancing can effectively reduce the transmission and severity of a disease, thereby reducing the pressure on healthcare systems and allowing more time for government countermeasures [10] .",

One of the main criteria for social distancing measures selection is the basic reproduction number R o which represents on average how many people a case (i.e., an infectious person) will infect during its entire infectious period [19] . For example, R o < 1 indicates that every case will infect less than 1 person, and thus the disease is declining in the considered population. Since the value of R o represents how quickly the disease is spreading, R o has been one of the most important indicators for social distancing measures selection [20] , [27] .

The attack rate reflects the severity of a disease at a given time, and thus it has different values during the disease outbreak. Among these values, the peak attack rate is often considered and compared to the current healthcare capacity (e.g., intensive care unit capacity) to see the current system's ability to handle the peak number of patients. After the outbreak is over, data is often collected to determine the final attack rate which is the ratio between the total number of infected cases in the population over the entire course of the outbreak.",

Different types of social distancing measures may have diverse levels of effectiveness on the disease spread. In [22] , the effect of social distancing measures at workplaces is evaluated by agent-based simulation approach. In particular, six different workplace strategies that reduce the number of workdays are simulated. The results show that, for a seasonal influenza (R o = 1.4), reducing the number of workdays can effectively reduce the final attack rate (e.g., up to 82% if three consecutive workdays are reduced). Nevertheless, in a pandemic-level influenza (R o = 2.0), reducing the number of workdays has significantly less impact, i.e., 3% (one extra day off) to 21% decrease (three extra consecutive days off). Several other studies present similar results. In [23] , it is shown that workplace social distancing can reduce the final attack rate by up to 39.22% in a R o = 1.4 setting. Similarly, [24] shows that different types of measures can reduce the attack rate from 11% to 20% depending on the frequency of contacts among the employees.",

In particular, the final attack rate can decrease from 65% to only 3% and the peak attack rate from 474 cases per 10 thousand to only five cases, in the highest R o setting. Similarly, [27] examines the effects when household quarantines, workplace closures, border control, and travel restrictions are combined. The results show that the final and peak attack rate are three times and six times, respectively, less than when no policy is implemented. Moreover, the peak attack rate can be delayed by nearly three months in a R o = 1.7 setting.

In this study, simulations are carried out without and with social distancing under different caution levels settings. Simulation results are evaluated based on the benefits of the reduced infection rate and the economic cost of reducing contacts. The main finding of this work is that a favorable result can only be obtained by implementing social distancing measures with a high caution level. Since the economic cost is also considered, it is shown that implementing social distancing with an insufficient caution level gives worse results than that of the without social distancing case. In [31] , a game theoretical approach based on the classic SIR model is proposed to evaluate the benefits and costs of social distancing measures. Interestingly, the results show that in the case where R o < 1, the equilibrium behaviors include no social distancing measures. Moreover, social distancing measures are shown to achieve the highest economical benefit when R o \u2248 2.",

Second, with recent advances in Wi-Fi based indoor positioning, Wi-Fi can provide reliable and precise location services to enable social distancing.

The above RSSI-based solutions can be easily adopted to detect crowds in indoor environments. Then, the local authorities can take appropriate actions to disperse the crowds or suggest other people to not go to the place.

Specifically, the geometric approach calculates the user device's position through the geometric relations between the device and the access point. Although being simple and easy to implement, this solution has low accuracy when detecting the user's location. This is due to the effects of nonline of sight (NLOS) on the wireless signals between the user's device and the access point, especially in dynamic and complicated environments in which the wireless signals are greatly affected by obstacle shadows caused by activities of people (e.g., running and walking) and infrastructures [43] . Another RSSI-based indoor localization technique is the fingerprinting approach (or radio map) that locates devices based on a previous built database. In particular, this database contains the signal fingerprints corresponding to several access points in a specific area. Nevertheless, collecting fingerprint data is time-consuming and laborious [46] , especially in large areas such as airports or train stations. In addition, it is infeasible to directly apply the pre-obtained fingerprint database to new areas for localization [47] , [48] . The principle reason is that the adjustment process to apply the fingerprint database of an area to other areas is time-consuming and requires human intervention.",

With these solutions, the authorities can detect crowds and force people to leave to enable social distancing in pandemic outbreaks. Specifically, in [43] , the authors study that when the environment changes, e.g., the presence of people in the line of sight between the user device and the access point, the performance of conventional RSSI-based localization techniques is greatly decreased. Thus, the authors propose an adaptive signal model fingerprinting algorithm to adapt with the dynamic of environment by detecting users' positions and updating the database simultaneously. In [47] , the authors propose a new localization technique to locate multiple users in different areas by performing a fine-grained localization. In addition, the authors introduce a transfer mechanism to adjust the fingerprint database over multiple areas to minimize the human intervention. Differently, an interesting design is proposed in [49] to locate and track people by using Wi-Fi technology, namely Wi-Vi (stands for Wi-Fi Vision). This technology allows the authorities to track people in indoor environments and detect potential crowds, so that they can take appropriate actions to enable social distancing, e.g., notify people to not go to potential crowded places. In particular, Wi-Vi uses an MIMO interference nulling to remove reflections from static objects and only focuses on moving objects, e.g., a user. Moreover, the authors propose to consider the movement of a user as an antenna array and then track the user by observing its RF beams.

Specifically, with various Wi-Fi access points implemented inside the building, the number of people currently inside the building can be estimated based on the number of connections from user devices to the access points. Based on this information, several actions can be made to practice social distancing such as forcing people to queue before entering the building to maintain a safe number of people inside the facilities at the same time. Another application is notifying people who want to go to the building. Specifically, based on the number of people inside the building, the authority can encourage/force them to stay home or come at a different time if the place is too crowded. However, the accuracy of this approach depends on many factors such as the number of smart devices one person possesses and how many devices can be connected to a network simultaneously. 4) Stay-at-home Encouragement: Wi-Fi technology can also be used to encourage people to stay at home by detecting the frequency of moving outside their houses for a particular time, e.g., a day. Specifically, when user devices move far away from the access point inside their houses, the connection between them will be weak or lost. Based on this information, the access points can estimate the frequency of moving out of their house and then notify the users to encourage them to stay at home as much as possible.",

According to the 3GPP standard, the current cellular networks, i.e., LTE and LTE-A, are employing various localization methods such as Assisted-GNSS (A-GNSS), Enhanced Cell-ID (E-CID), and Observed TDoA (O-TDoA) as specified in the Release 9; Uplink-TDoA (U-TDoA) included in the Release 11; and with the aids of other technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS) as stated in the Release 13 [115] , [116] . Cellphone location data collected by the current cellular network is normally used for network operations and managers [116] such as network planning and optimization to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) rather than user applications due to the low accuracy and resource consumption. However, in the context of social distancing, user tracking based on data of user movement history can be considered to be an effective approach for quarantined people detection, and infected people tracing. For instance, the authorities can check whether infected people are violating the quarantine requirements or not. In cases if they do not follow the requirements, the authorities can send warning messages or even perform some aggressive measures, e.g., fines and arrests, to force them self-isolation. Moreover, when a user has been exposed to the virus, the user's mobility history can be extracted to investigate the spread of the virus. In these cases, the cellular technology can outperform other wireless technologies in term of availability and popularity. For example, localization services relying on wireless technologies such as GPS that always need to be run in the foreground application (i.e., the availability), while this service is a part of cellular network operations. In addition, Ultra-wideband and Zigbee technologies require additional hardware [86] , [103] (i.e., the popularity). Incoming 5G networks with the presence of key technologies such as mm-Wave communications, D2D communications, and Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) [117] are capable of performing a high precision localization. Two positioning schemes exploiting the mm-Wave communications are proposed in [118] based on validation of triangulation measurements and angle of differences of arrival (ADoA). The authors in [119] proposed a positioning scheme in UDNs using a cascaded Extended Kalman filter (EKF) structure to fuse the DoA and ToA estimations from the reference nodes. The proposed scheme can localize a moving target at speed 50 km/h with a sub-meter level accuracy. It can be used for tracking vehicles and monitoring the traffic density.",

Moscow government is also said to be planning to use SIM card data for tracking foreigners and residents who have close contacts with foreigners when the border closure order is lifted [121] .

Instead, group/crowd detecting and monitoring based on shared location data which is anonymous and aggregated from carriers become the key approach utilized by several governments such as Italy, Germany, Austria), the UK, Korea, and Australia [124] - [127] . This approach is intended to alleviate privacy concerns compared with individual-level tracking (i.e., it satisfies the EU privacy rules [123] ).

There are many research works on network traffic prediction proposed in [128] - [132] based on the history of users' movements. Furthermore, the number of users in a specific area can be also estimated from the network traffic of that area as illustrated in Fig. 7(b) . Thus, the authorities can predict the crowd gathering in public places (e.g., shopping malls, airports and train stations) relying on the corresponding forecasted network traffic. Then, appropriate actions can be performed by the authorities to prevent crowd gathering in these places. For example, if the predicted number of people entering a shopping mall exceeds a threshold, the authorities can notify customers to avoid coming to this place at this time or recommend them to go to other shopping malls having lower densities. In addition, this method can be also applied in residential areas to study how often people stay home as well as predict when they go out or the places they come to. This can provide significant data input for network traffic forecast in public places. In addition, if they regularly go to necessary places, the authorities can warn or force them to stay at home as much as possible.",

Therefore, some video conference applications used to work from home or study online have witnessed an explosion of downloads. For example, the Zoom application has achieved an increase by 1,270% from 22 Feb to 22 Mar in 2020 [133] and the number of newly registered users of Microsoft Teams has also risen 775% monthly in Italy after the full lockdown was started [134] . As a result, 5G live broadcasting technology can be used to encourage people to stay at home as much as possible without any impacts on their work, or study ( Fig. 7(c) ). There are many works to enhance the quality of video multicast/broadcast applications by utilizing the advances of 5G networks [135] - [139] . Video multicast/broadcast services are defined as an ultra high definition slice in an MIMO system [135] . To improve the spectrum efficiency for video multicast/broadcast in the proposed system, the authors introduce a hybrid digital-analog scheme to tackle channel condition and antenna heterogeneity. Another possible solution that can significantly improve qualities for video multicasting/broadcasting is data caching. A novel caching paradigm proposed in [136] is applied for multicast services in heterogeneous networks. With the awareness of multicast files, the proposed caching policy can select files efficiently for the caches. Studies in [137] , [138] propose using NOMA techniques to support multicast/broadcast by increasing the spectrum efficiency in multi-user environments. Finally, the authors in [139] propose a video multicast orchestration scheme for 5G UDNs which can help to improve the spectrum efficiency.",

Bluetooth devices can automatically detect and connect to other devices nearby, forming a kind of adhoc called piconet [60] . Recently, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been introduced as an extended version of the classic Bluetooth to reduce the energy usage of devices and improve the communication performance [60] . Given above, the BLE localization technology possesses several advantages compared with those of the Wi-Fi localization. First, the BLE signals have a higher sample rate than that of the Wi-Fi signals (i.e., 0.25 Hz \u223c 2 Hz) [61] . Second, the BLE technology consumes less power than that of the Wi-Fi technology, and thus can be implemented widely in handheld devices. Third, the BLE signals can be obtained from most smart devices, while Wi-Fi signals can be obtained from only access points. Finally, BLE beacons are usually powered by battery, and thereby they are more flexible and easier to deploy than Wi-Fi.",

When there is an infected case, the authorities can ask people to share these records as a part of a contact tracing investigation. Thereby, the authorities can detect people who may have close contact with the infected one and notify them promptly to prevent the spreading of diseases. Several attempts to use Bluetooth in contact tracing have been reported. Apple and Google have recently introduced an mobile application (running on both iPhone and Android devices) that can detect other smartphones nearby by using Bluetooth technology [64] , [65] . If a person is tested positive for a disease, he/she will enter the result in the app to inform others about that. Then, people who may have close contact with the positive case will be notified and instructed about what to do next. Similar apps have 2) Crowd Detection: Bluetooth technology can be used to detect crowds in indoor environments to practice social distancing with the latest advances in Bluetooth localization techniques [70] , [72] . In particular, based on signals received from users' Bluetooth devices, a central controller can calculate the positions of users and detect/predict crowds in indoor environments. If a crowd is detected, the local manager can force people to leave to practice social distancing. In addition, they can advice people who want to go to the place to come at different time if the place is too crowed at the moment.. In [70] , the authors point out that with the development of Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth-based indoor localization can be considered as a practical method to locate Bluetooth devices in indoor environments due to its low battery cost and high communication performance. The authors then propose indoor localization schemes that collect RSSI measurements to detect the user's location by using the triangulation mechanism. In [71] , the authors show that the BLE technology is strongly affected by the fast fading interference, resulting in a low accuracy when detecting the user's device. To improve the accuracy of the BLE positioning, the authors run several experimental tests to choose the optimal parameters to set up BLE localization systems. The authors demonstrate that the BLE-based indoor localization can achieve a better performance than that of Wi-Fi localization system. The authors in [73] point out that the accuracy of BLE-based localization is strongly affected by advertising channels, human movements, and human obstacles.",

Specifically, similar to the Wi-Fi technology, based on RSSI levels, a device can calculate the distances between it and other nearby devices [72] . It is worth noting that the Bluetooth technology can allow a device to connect to multiple devices at the same time [59] .

Due to the wide bandwidth nature of UWB signals (at least 500 MHz as specified by FCC [100] ), the impulse radio (IR) UWB technology has the capability of generating a series of very short duration Gaussian pulses in time domain which enables its advantages compared with other RF technology. Pulse position modulation with time hopping (TH-PPM) is the most popular modulation scheme exploited in the impulse radio based UWB [101] . This pulse can directly propagate in the radio channel without the need of an additional carrier modulation. The basebandlike architecture of the IR-UWB facilitates extremely simple and low-power transmitters. Thus, the advantages of the IR-UWB technology can greatly support social distancing, even better than other wireless technologies (e.g., higher accuracy in indoor positioning applications) or provide exclusive solutions (e.g., device-free tracking/counting) for some scenarios, as discussed below.",

There are many commercial products exploiting the IR-UWB technology for real-time localization in both daily life and factories such as DecaWave [102] , BeSpoon [103] , Zebra [104] , Ubisense [105] . DecaWave and BeSpoon claim their products based on ranging measurements can offer an accuracy under 10 cm [102] , [103] . Furthermore, Ubisense and Zebra provide industrial products which can obtain the high accuracy even in cluttered, indoor factory environments [104] , [105] . All of them support real-time positioning for multiple mobile tags by using the triangulation techniques based on the absolute locations of reference nodes or anchors (e.g., UWB transceivers). Especially, the Dimension4 sensor invented by Ubisense can be integrated with a built-in GPS module for outdoor tracking purposes. Experiments conducted to evaluate holistically the performance of three commercial products (i.e., DecaWave, BeSpoon, and Ubisense) under indoor industrial environment setting (with the presence of NLOS) can be found in [106] . The availability of commercial UWB-based localization systems enables real-time people tracking in public places by localizing their UWB-supported phones, or personal belongings equipped with tags (e.g., keys and shoes). Thus, the authorities can detect the crowd to notify them and other people in the area, disperse the crowd or even predict and prevent the forming of the crowd by using AI/Deep learning algorithms based on the previously collected data.",

            "text": "Recently, device-free localization (or passive positioning) techniques have witnessed a significant increase of interests since it can tackle problems of communication-based localization approaches mentioned above, which are: (i) privacy issues (e.g., tracking targets do not need to communicate with an access point/network coordinator, thus it can protect private information of the target), and (ii) physical obstacles (e.g., LOS communications have significant influence by obstacles) [107] . The high time-domain resolution feature of the IR-UWB technology enables the device-free localization methods relying on the changes of very short pulses properties between two transceivers because of absorption, scattering, diffraction, reflection, and refraction [108] , [109] . In particular, the authors in [108] use monostatic radar modules (i.e., P410 platform) equipped with one transmitter and one receiver for multi-target tracking based on Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filters. Information (including raw signal, bandpass signal, motion filtered signal and detection list) extracted from the reflected signals is used to estimate the locations of targets with an accuracy at the decimeter level. To improve the accuracy, a multi-static is deployed in [109] to track a person in real time by determining the difference between the newly channel impulse response with the presence of a new object with that of the previous one without the object. The location of the object can be found with the mean error of only 3 cm by applying a leading edge detection algorithm on the difference of the two measurements. However, the limitation of this work is that it can track only one target at a time. Motivated by the above works, we can easily deploy device-free localization techniques for crowd detection in public areas such as airports, train stations, and shopping malls without revealing any personal information and hardware requirements on target objects. Thereby, the authorities can locate exact locations of crowds and have appropriate actions to disperse crowds or force them to practice social distancing. b) Public Place Monitoring and Access Scheduling: A simple solution for public place monitoring is referred to as device (or tag)-free counting techniques [110] , [111] . Specifically, the authors in [110] propose an advanced people counting algorithm with less computation based on the revelation of the received signal pattern according to the number of people illustrated in Fig. 10(a) . This method enables people counting even with the presence of dense multipath signals in the environment which is not able to be performed by counting techniques based on detecting single signals corresponding to individual persons. For example, other counting approaches using Wi-Fi and Zigbee rely on the number of connections from users to an access points (i.e., Wi-Fi) or a network coordinator (i.e., Zigbee). Major clusters are picked up to find main pulses having maximum amplitude. A joint probability density function derived from these main pulses is utilized to derive maximum likelihood (ML) equation. Then, the estimated number of people is determined to be the figure having the maximum likelihood as shown in Fig. 10(b) . Similarly, the solution in [111] also provides a counting approach without positioning targets by using the crowd-centric method based on energy detection. Without the need of hardware deployment on counting objects like Wi-Fi and Zigbee, the approaches proposed in [110] , [111] can provide a low-cost and highprivacy solution to detect the number of people in public areas (e.g., shopping malls, airports, train stations, and offices). Further actions can be conducted by the local manager to maintain social distancing such as scheduling people to enter the place based on the counting information or giving advice to other people who are planning to go to the crowded place to come at a different time.",

Moreover, close physical contact tracing based on information of the aforementioned solutions can be also implemented when there is a new infected person. We will discuss all these solutions in the following sections. a) Keeping distance and contact tracing: Similar to Bluetooth, the IR-UWB technology can also be applied to maintain the distances between people as well as close physical contact tracing by using ranging methods with high precision in both indoor and outdoor environments [102] , [112] . While DecaWave provides a ranging measurement using sensors and tags [102] , Apple has already brought this feature to their phones (e.g., Iphone 11 series) for their primitive location-based services (e.g., finding objects and improving AirDrop) [112] . These approaches use time-based ranging techniques like ToF, TDoA or combined ToF and AoA to measure the distances to nearby sensors, tags or phones. However, these products can be employed to detect close proximity between users in public places. Thanks to the IR-UWB technology, they can frequently broadcast pilot messages containing some information (e.g., their specific IDs, timestamp, etc.) to nearby devices for ranging measurements with extremely low energy consumption. Then, surrounding devices can utilize the information of the received messages to estimate the distance from the source device and warn the users if they are too close to each other (e.g., less than 1.5m in a pandemic situation [12] ). In addition, these devices can also store other information like who had close contacts with them along with the distances and duration periods. This information is very important because it can be used to trace close contacts in the future (e.g., investigate the spread of the virus in a pandemic) with minimal privacy violation.",

This product provides both evaluation kits and an ultra-compact UWB module which can be easily integrated into off-the-shelf products (e.g., shopping trolleys or baskets) for localization and navigation purposes. A SnapLoc platform proposed in [113] allows an unlimited number of tags to self estimate their locations at position update rates up to 2.3 KHz. It uses the TDoA technique based on all simultaneous responded information from reference nodes integrated into one single channel impulse response. By combining with the positioning service (i.e., to provide locations of other people in a specific area), a navigation application exploiting commercial products like BeSpoon can be developed to assist people (e.g., customers) for self-detecting their current locations as well as crowds' locations along the way, thereby assisting them to plan their moves and navigate to stay away from crowds.",

When a receiver receives the navigation messages from the satellites, it can calculate the distances from its location to the satellites based on the transmitting time in the messages. Basically, to calculate the current location of a user, it requires at least three different navigation messages from three different satellites (based on the Trilateration mechanism presented in Section II). However, in practice, to achieve a high accuracy in calculating the location of a user, at least four different messages from four satellites are required (the fourth one is to address the time synchronization problem at the receiver) [140] .

Specifically, most of smart phones now are equipped with GPS devices which can be used to track locations of mobile users when needed. In the context of a pandemic outbreak, e.g., COVID-19, many suspects, for example, returning from an infected area, will be required to be self-isolated. Thus, to monitor these people, the authorities can ask them to wear GPS-based positioning devices to make sure that they do not leave their residences during the quarantine [161] , [162] . The main advantage of using GNSS technology compared to Wi-Fi or Infrared-based solutions for people tracking is that this technology allows to monitor people anywhere and anytime globally, and thus even the suspects move from one city to another city, the authorities still can track and monitor them. However, one of the major disadvantages of this technology is that it much depends on the satellite signals. Thus, in some areas with weak or high interference signals (e.g., inside a building or in crowed areas), the location accuracy is very low [151] , [160] , [163] .",

            "text": "1) Crowd Detection: One potential application of RFID technology is locating users in indoor environments based on recent RFID-based localization solutions [76] - [80] . To that end, each user is equipped with an RFID tag, e.g., the staff ID or member cards. Based on the backscattered signals from the RFID tag, the RFID reader can determine the location of the user. If there are too many people in the same area, the system can notify the authorities to take appropriate actions, e.g., force people to leave the area to practice social distancing. Several recent mechanisms in the literature can be adopted to make this application possible during pandemic outbreaks. In [78] , the authors propose an RFID-based localization system for indoor environments with high localization granularity and accuracy. The key idea of this solution is reducing the RSSI shifts, localization error, and computational complexity by using Heron-bilateration estimation and Kalman-filter drift removal. In [79] , the authors propose to use a moving robot to enhance the accuracy of a real-time RFID-based localization system. In particular, the robot is able to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and thus it can continuously interrogate all RFID tags in its area. Then, based on passive RFID tags at known locations, we can estimate the location of target tags by properly manipulating the measured backscattered power. Alternatively, in [76] , the authors propose to equipped two RFID tags at the target instead of only one as in conventional solutions to improve the accuracy of localization techniques. Adding one more RFID tag possesses several advantages: (i) easy to implement and adjust the RFID reader's antenna, (ii) enabling fine-grained calculation, and (iii) enabling accurate calibration. The experimental results then show that equipping two tags at the user can greatly increase the localization accuracy of the system. However, the RFID technology has several limitations due to the fact that both the receiver and the RF source are in the RFID reader. Specifically, the modulated signals backsacttered from the RFID tag are strongly affected by the round-trip path loss from the receiver and the RF source. In addition, the RFID system can also be affected by the doubly near-far problem [81] . To address these problems, a few recent works propose to use bistatic and ambient backscatter communication technologies (extended version of RFID) for localization [82] , [83] . The key idea is separating the RF source from the receiver. The RF source now can be a dedicated carrier emitter or an ambient RF source. The tag then can transmit data to the receiver by backscattering the RF signals generated by the RF source. Based on the received signals, the receiver can estimate the location of the tag. In [83] , the authors propose a localization system based on backscatter communications to locate patients in a hospital. In particular, each patient is equipped with a backscatter tag which can backscatter signals broadcast by an RF source. Then, the location of a patient can be detected by a localization algorithm, namely Remix, based on the backscattered signals from the backscatter tags. Remix consists of two processes. First, the algorithm approximates the distance from the tag to the receiver based on the backscattered signals. Second, the signal paths are modeled with linear splines. Then, an optimization problem is solved to find the effective distances corresponding to the paths that close to the actual paths from the tag to the receiver. As a result, Remix can accurately estimate the position of the backscatter tag by modeling the spline structure. Based on the users' locations, Remix can detect crowds in the hospital and advice the authorities to take appropriate actions to practice social distancing. Note that this solution can also be deployed to detect crowds in other places such as workplaces, schools, and supermarkets where backscatter tags can be easily attached to users/customers' cards, e.g., staff cards, student cards, and member cards.",

In particular, an RFID reader will be deployed at the main gate of a place, and users are equipped with RFID tags (can be both active and passive tags). The users' tags can broadcast their ID (active) or send their ID upon receiving RF signals from the RFID reader (passive). When a user enters the place, the RFID reader can receive the user's ID and increase the counter. As such, the RFID reader can calculate the number of people inside the place. If there are too many people, the system can notify the local manager to force people to queue before entering the place to practice social distancing. This solution can be deployed in supermarkets or workplaces where the customer/staff usually have member/staff ID cards which can be equipped with RFID tags.",

In this case, a temporalspatial Bayesian model is developed to select influential friends considering their influence levels to the user. Thus, the service provider can predict the exact location of a mobile user by using the temporal-spatial Bayesian model. Then, when the user is too close to other mobile users/people at crowded public places or his/her friends when they go in a group as illustrated in Fig. 11(a) , his/her smartphone can alert to keep a safe distance. In addition, using the list of influential friends based on their ranks, the service provider can utilize it for the contact tracing purpose when the mobile user or one of his/her influential friends in the list gets infected.",

In [343] , the authors apply the auto-encoder neural networks and one-class support vector machines to verify whether a user is within a specific area or not. Considering various channel models, i.e., path-loss, shadowing, and fading, the proposed solutions can achieve Neyman-Pearson optimal performance by observing the probability of missdetections and false-alarms. The authors in [344] propose a novel localization system leveraging a federated learning to allow mobile users to collaboratively provide accurate location services without revealing mobile users' private location. As such, the authors utilize deep neural networks with the Gaussian process to accurately predict the desired location of the mobile users. As a result, we can apply the proposed solutions to detect if infected people or at-risk people currently move away from their homes as illustrated in Fig. 11(c) . Moreover, we can utilize the proposed solutions to determine the movement frequency of the self-isolated people outside the protection facility. Using the movement frequency history, the authorities can enforce them to stay at the protection facility for further infection prevention.",

This approach maps the pixels from image to the bounding box grid and class probabilities to detect humans or objects in real-time. Following this direction, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) method proposed in [178] can detect/predict objects (even small ones) in real-time with high accuracy. In addition, in [179] , the authors propose the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) framework which uses a convolution network on the image to calculate a feature map and then predict the bounding box. Through experimental results, they demonstrate that this method can detect objects faster and more accurately than those of both YOLO and Faster-RCNN. For public place monitoring, both YOLO [178] and SSD [179] can be used to detect fast and accurately humans from real-time images or videos of surveillance cameras.

Specifically, detecting human behaviors, motion, and pose in computer vision can play a pivotal role [187] . Pose estimation captures a person with different parts (as illustrated in Fig. 12(c) ) then detects human behaviors by studying the parts' movements and their correlation. For example, a coughing person in Fig. 12 (c) usually moves his hand near his head and his head would have a vibration.",

For this purpose, computer vision technology can not only detect the infected people by facial recognition, but also contribute in the positioning process. In [249] , the movement of people is determined by analyzing the key point of transition frames captured from smartphone cameras. This method can draw the trajectory of movements and the location with the accuracy around 2 meters. In [250] , the authors propose to combine the human detection techniques of computer vision with digital map information to improve the accuracy. In this study, the user path from cameras is mapped to the digital map which has the GPS coordinates. This method gave can achieve a very high accuracy within two meters. In another approach, the authors in [251] propose to use both smartphones' cameras and inertial-sensor-based systems to accurately localize targets (with only 6.9 cm error). This approach uses fusion of keypoints and squared planar markers to enhance the accuracy for cameras to compensate the errors of inertial sensors. 5) Keeping Distance: Keeping a suitable distance, especially from crowds, to prevent infection with the virus is one of the key factors of practicing social distancing. To support people in keeping distance to/from the crowds, computer vision can be utilized. In [248] , the authors develop an ondevice machine learning-based system leveraging radar sensors and cameras of a smartphone. When the radar sensor detects the surrounding moving objects, the smartphone camera can be utilized to capture its surrounding environment. Taking into account the recorded data, the smartphone can train the data using machine learning algorithms to determine the existence of nearby people and its distance from those people with respect to the social distancing requirements. We can also use a smartphone to estimate the distance between the mobile user and other people using radar sensors and cameras along with machine learning algorithms.",

The system includes ultrasonic beacons (UBs) as tags or nodes attached on users and transceivers. Beacon units broadcast periodically ultrasonic pulses and radio frequency (RF) messages simultaneously with their unique ID numbers. Based on these pulses and messages, the receiver's position can be determined by position calculation methods such as trilateration or triangulation [194] . In comparison with other RF-based ranging methods, the UPS does not require a line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver, and it also does not interfere with electromagnetic waves. However, since the propagation of the ultrasound wave is limited, most UPS applications for social distancing are only applicable for the indoor environment. 1) Keeping Distance: Keeping distance in social distancing aims to maintain a safe distance between people to prevent the spread of the disease. For this purpose, UPS can be used to position and notify people. One of the first well known UPS systems is Active Bat (AB) [195] based on the time-offlight of the ultrasonic pulse. Typically, an AB system consists of an ultrasonic receiver matrix located on the ceiling or wall, a transmitter attached to each target, and a centralized computation system to calculate the objects' positions. As presented in [195] , by using a receiver matrix with 16 sensors, the AB system can achieve very high positioning accuracy, i.e., less than 14 centimeters. However, a limitation of this system is its high complexity, especially if a large number of ultrasonic sensors are deployed.",

Among the other positioning technologies, only the infrared technology shares the same characteristic. Nevertheless, infrared signals prone to interference from sunlight and other thermal sources, and they also suffer from line-ofsight loss [194] . As a result, ultrasound is the most efficient technology for binary positioning [194] , i.e., determine if the object is in the same room as the UBs or not. Thus, UPS can be particularly useful in the social distancing scenarios where the exact positions of people are not as necessary as the number of people inside a room (e.g., to limit the number of people). This technology is more efficient because it needs a few reference nodes (e.g., UBs) to determine the binary positions of people, which can significantly reduce implementation costs.",

Generally, INS has been commonly used for medical robots applications, including surgeon assists, patient motion assists, and delivery robots. In this section, we will only focus on the medical and delivery robots applications for social distancing purposes. In [291] , a novel INS system is developed specifically for mobile robot navigation. In addition, an error model is proposed to increase the accuracy of the involved inertial measurements. A Kalman filter is also proposed to precisely estimate the velocity and orientation of the robot in the presence of noises. A novel data fusion algorithm, leveraging an adaptive Kalman filter is presented in [292] for indoor robot positioning based on a INS/UWB hybrid system. Unlike INS for mobile robots that are mostly developed for indoor environment, INS for UAV focuses on outdoor applications. Note that UAV navigation must also consider its altitude, which adds more complexity. The authors of [293] leverage inertial sensors and cameras to determine the UAV's position, velocity, and altitude. Particularly, the cameras attached to the UAV capture the images of the surrounding environment and send to a control station. This station will then process the images to determine the UAV's pose in regards to the surroundings. The pose's data is then combined with the inertial sensors data via a Kalman filter to determine the UAV's position and velocity. Similarly, a system combining inertial and vision sensors is developed in [294] for UAV positioning and navigation. The system utilizes two observers which have inertial and vision sensors. The first observer calculates the orientation based on gyroscope and vision sensors, while the second observer determines the position and velocity based on data from the accelerometers and vision sensors.",

Utilizing this technology, some applications can be implemented to support social distancing such as tracking individuals who are being quarantined, detecting and monitoring crowds in public places (e.g., shopping malls, airports, train stations and workplaces) as shown in Fig. 15(a) . a) Photodiode-based VLC systems: Due to many advantages such as low cost and easy to implement, the VLC receiver using photodiodes can be employed as a \"tag\" that is integrated into mobile targets such as trolleys/shopping carts, autonomous robots, etc. People attached with these tags can perform self-positioning based on the triangulation method, so that they can avoid crowed areas. Furthermore, the tags' locations can be collected by the authorities to monitor people in the public areas. Based on this location data, further actions can be carried out such as warning people by varying the color temperature of the lights in the crowded areas. It is worth noting that this solution can not reveal any personal information of users (e.g., customers) since it only requires communications between VLC-based tags and light fixtures. However, most VLC systems only provide a half-duplex communications due to the fact that LED lights operate as the role of transmitters. Therefore, they should be combined with other wireless technologies like Bluetooth [218] , [219] , Infrared [220] to enable an uplink communication with the server for location information exchange. Moreover, to improve the accuracy of positioning people in indoor environments using photodiodes, some advanced techniques can be used such as data fusion of AOA and RSS methods proposed in [221] and the AOA method using a multi-LED element lighting fixture introduced in [222] . One main disadvantage of the photodiodebased VLC systems is the need of additional hardware (i.e., the photodiode receiver) mounted on smart trolleys/shopping carts to receive light signals. Consequently, the system might fail to detect the locations of people who do not carry them. Nevertheless, pureLiFi company has recently invented a tiny optical front end which can be integrated into smartphones to take benefits of the photodiode receiver in high accuracy VLC-based localization services [223] .",

The captured photos collected regularly by the front-facing camera are sent to a cloud/fog server for image processing to alleviate the computation on the phone. Then, the beacon's ID and coordinates can be extracted and sent back to the phone. After that, the AoA algorithm is implemented to estimate the location and orientation of the phone. An attractive use case of the camera-based VLC systems [218] , [219] , [224] is to assist users to quickly find specific products in shopping malls, or supermarkets. Thus, we can adopt this function to implement tracking and monitoring crowds in public places (e.g., shopping malls, airports and train stations) as well as assisting people to avoid crowds in a proactive manner. It is worth noting that this solution is more convenient than using photodiodes since it uses front-facing cameras of smartphones as the VLC receivers, thus everyone using smartphones can be tracked.

Therefore, autonomous assistance systems using VLC technology can be employed to minimize the physical contacts as shown in Fig. 15(a) and (b) . a) Information assistance: Besides the navigation purpose, the smart retail systems [218] , [219] can also provide information assistance services for shoppers. For example, the product description, sale information or other necessary information can be displayed on screen when the phone is under a certain LED light. Another example system is information assistance services in museum [226] , [227] . This can help to reduce the number of close physical contacts in these places. b) Autonomous robot: Similar to the information assistance systems for reducing close physical contacts, autonomous robots using the VLC technology for communication and localization can also be deployed to assist people in certain circumstances, for example, elderly-assistant robots, walking-assistant robots, shopping-assistant robots, etc., [228] , [229] . Moreover, visible light signals do not cause any interference to RF signals, and thus they can effectively deployed in diverse indoor environments such as hospitals, schools and workplaces.",

By adopting smart traffic light systems in [230] , [231] , we can deploy an intelligent traffic controlling system using the VLC technology to control large traffic flows as illustrated in Fig. 15(c) . That can help to avoid high density of vehicles in public areas. The VLC technology provides a communication method between vehicles and the light infrastructure (e.g., traffic lights, street lights). First, vehicles can send its information (e.g., their IDs) to the light infrastructure by using its headlights as transmitters, thus the system can detect and monitor the traffic flow. However, in this case, it is required that the light infrastructure must be equipped with VLC receivers (e.g., traffic cameras or photodiodes). Second, based on the awareness of the traffic, the system can control the vehicles by sending instructions to guide them. In this case, the system uses traffic lights, or street lights as transmitters to send information and the vehicles use dash cameras to receive the information. For example, the system will notify them about hot zones that have a high density of vehicles and do not allow them to enter, so that they can avoid these zones.",

By leveraging such commercial approaches, we can deploy the cost-effective crowd monitoring system on a large scale, not only in shopping malls or hypermarkets, but also in other public places such as airports, train stations and hospitals based on the existing illuminating infrastructures. Building/facilities managers can immediately alert or notify the users if they are in the middle of a crowd (e.g., varying the color temperature of the lights in the high-density zones). People can also take the initiative in planning their move to the desired locations without encountering the crowds. On the other hand, assistance systems help to reduce the number of staffs/volunteers, nurses inside public buildings; or limit the close contacts between them and customers, patients. Moreover, the combination with other RF technologies such as Bluetooth and Infrared also ensures the location-based services are not interrupted when the smartphone is not being actively used by the user (e.g., the phone is in the pocket). Last but not least, the VLC technology can be a potential communication method between the intelligent traffic controlling system and vehicles in the outdoor environment. However, the main disadvantage of the VLC technology is that interference from ambient and sun lights have significant impacts on the visible light communication channels [215] , [217] . It results in poor performance of the RSS-based positioning approaches and outdoor communications.",

In particular, Apple utilizes random and rotating identifiers to preserve mobile users' movements privacy [309] . Meanwhile, Google aggregates and uses anonymized dataset from mobile users who turn on their location history settings in their Android smartphones. In this case, a differential privacy approach is applied by adding random noise to the location dataset with the aim to mask individual identification of a mobile user [307] . Similar to Google, Facebook utilizes aggregated and anonymized user mobility datasets and maps to determine the mobility trend in certain areas including the social connectedness intensity among nearby locations [308] . In addition to the Apple's, Google's, and Facebook's latest privacy-preserving implementation, in the following, we will thoroughly discuss how the latest advances in security and privacy-preserving techiques can help to facilitate social distancing without compromising users' interest/privacy.

In this case, the framework applies the K-means machine learning algorithm to cluster the trajectories from real-world GPS datasets and ensure the K-anonymity for high-sensitive datasets. Using the K-anonymity [318] , [319] , the framework can collect location information from K mobile users within a cloaking region, i.e., the region where the mobile users' exact locations are hidden [320] , [321] . In [322] , the use of K-anonymity is extended into a continuous network location privacy anonymity, i.e., K DT-anonymity, which not only considers the average anonymity size K, but also takes the average distance deviation D and the anonymity duration T into account. Leveraging those three metrics, the mobile users under realistic vehicle mobility conditions can control the changes of anonymity and distance deviation magnitudes over time.",

In this case, the vehicles first hide their IP addresses due to the default network address translation operated by mobile internet service providers. Then, they generate fake path segments that separate from the vehicles' actual paths to prevent the location-based service server from tracking the vehicles. Exploiting dedicated short range communications (DSRC) among vehicles and road navigation information from the GPS, the vehicles can mutually generate made-up location updates with each other when they communicate with the location-based service server (to obtain spatio-temporal-related information). In [324] , vehicles which use location-based services can dynamically update virtual locations in a realtime with respect to the relative locations of current nearby vehicles.

In [325] , a location privacy-preserving method leveraging spatio-temporal events of mobile users in continuous location-based services, e.g., office visitation, is investigated. Specifically, an -differential privacy is designed to protect spatio-temporal event against attackers through adding random noise to the event data [328] - [330] . In [331] , the authors present a location privacy protection mechanism using data perturbation for smart health system in a hospital. In particular, instead of reporting the patient's real locations directly, a main processing unit attached to a patient's body can adaptively produce perturbed locations, i.e., the relative change between different locations of the patient. In this case, the system considers the patient's travel directions and computes the distance between the patient's current locations and the patient's sensitive locations (i.e., patient's pre-defined locations which he/she does not want to reveal to anyone, e.g., patient's treating room). Using this dynamic location perturbation, the need of a trusted third party to store real locations can be removed. Leveraging the aforementioned methods, we can also prevent the service provider to access mobile users' and vehicles' exact locations/trajectories/paths when they implement social distancing for crowd/traffic density and movement detection. Specifically, a platoon of mobile users/vehicles in a certain area can collaborate together to mix their real locations/trajectories/paths anonymously ( Fig. 18(a) ). In this way, the service provider will only obtain the aggregated location/trajectory/path information of the platoon instead of each individual's exact location/trajectory/path for its location privacy.",

In [332] , the authors de-velop a pseudo-identity exchanging protocol to swap/exchange identity information among mobile users when they are at the same sensitive locations, e.g., hospital and residential areas. In particular, when a mobile user receives another trusted user's identity and private key, the mobile user will verify if the encryption of another user's identity hash function and public key is equal to the encryption of the received private key. If that condition holds, the mobile user will change his/her identity with that user's identity and vice versa.",

In particular, instead of directly submitting a request to the server, a mobile user can have his/her social friends through the available social network resources, i.e., trusted social medias, to distribute his/her request anonymously to the server. The request result can be returned to his/her social friends and then forwarded to the requested mobile user, thereby preserving the requested mobile user's identity. In fact, there may exist some malicious friends which expose the identity of the mobile user. Therefore, the authors in [334] investigate a user-defined privacy-sharing framework on social network to choose his/her particular friends who are trusted to obtain the mobile user's identity information. In this case, the mobile user only shares his/her identity information with the particular friends whose pseudonyms match the mobile user's identity through authorized access control. Using the same approaches from the above works, we can use local wireless connections, e.g., Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct, to anonymously exchange actual location information in a mobile user group, i.e., between a mobile user and his/her trusted nearby mobile users, in an ad hoc way. As shown in Fig. 18(b) , when the service provider requires to collect location-related information for the current crowd density detection, a representative mobile user from the group can send the group's anonymous location information to the service provider, aiming at preserving personal identity of each mobile user in the group.",

The tracing key is a 32-byte string that is generated by using a cryptographic random number generator when the app is enabled on the device. The tracing key is securely stored on the device. The daily tracing key is generated for every 24-hour window by using the SHA-256 hash function with the tracing key. The rolling proximity identifier is a privacy-preserving identifier which is sent in Bluetooth advertisements. This identifier is generated by using the SHA-256 hash function with the daily tracing key. Each time the Bluetooth MAC address change, the app can derive a new identifier. When a positive case is diagnosed, their daily tracing keys are uploaded to a server. This server then distributes them to the clients who use the app. Based on this information, each of the clients will be able to derive the sequence of the rolling proximity identifiers that were broadcasted from the user who tested positive. In this way, the privacy of the users can be ensured because without the daily tracing key, one cannot obtain the user's rolling proximity identifier. In addition, the server operator also cannot track the user's location or who users have been in proximity.",

Fig 19 illustrates several social distancing scenarios where scheduling and optimization techniques can be applied. In particular, scheduling techniques can be applied to reduce the number of necessary employees at the workplace and the number of patients coming to the hospital, thereby reducing the unnecessary contacts among people. Moreover, traffic scheduling can help to reduce the peak number of vehicles and pedestrians, and optimization techniques can help to deal with the extra pressures on the online services when there are more people staying at home. 1) Workforce Scheduling: Workforce scheduling can help to limit the number of people at the workplaces, while ensuring the necessary work is done. While working from home is encouraged in social distancing, sometimes employees must be present at the workplace for certain tasks (e.g., machine operators). Moreover, different types of tasks impose different constraints such as due date (time constraints), dependence among tasks (precedence constraints), skill requirements (skill constraints), and limited resources usage (resource constraints) which further complicates the scheduling problem. For such scenarios, workforce scheduling techniques can be utilized to optimally align and reduce the number of required employees to practice social distancing. In [263] , a novel threephase algorithm is proposed for workforce scheduling to optimize the operational cost and service level simultaneously. Another Genetic-Algorithm-based hybrid approach is presented in [264] , which optimizes the schedules of workforce according to multiple objectives including urgency, skill considerations, and workload balance. Similarly, in [265] , a Mixed-Integer-Programming-based approach is developed to minimize the operational cost with consideration of skill constraints. It is worth noting that the main objective of these approaches is to minimize cost, which is not the highest priority in the context of social distancing. In [266] , [267] , and [268] , several methods are proposed to optimize the workforce schedules with consideration of rotating shifts, which indirectly reduce the number of employees to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the main objective of these approaches is also reducing cost. Therefore, developing techniques which account for the physical contacts or distance among employees at the workplace is critical for workforce scheduling in social distancing scenarios.",

Several approaches have been proposed to effectively schedule appointments. In particular, a local search algorithm is proposed in [269] to minimize the patient waiting times, doctor idle times, and tardiness (lateness). Moreover, a two-stage bounding approach and a heuristic is presented in [270] and [272] , respectively. However, a common limitation of these techniques is that they do not take into account the uncertainties in the duration of the appointments and the possibility that the patient will not come to the scheduled appointment. To address that, the uncertainty in the processing times (e.g., of surgeries) is considered by a conic optimization approach in [271] . Similarly, a multistage stochastic linear program is developed in [273] to minimize patient waiting times and overtime, which takes into account the unpredictable appointment duration and unplanned cancellations. Although there are many effective approaches to optimize appointment scheduling, the open issue is to develop techniques that specifically minimize or control the number of patients simultaneously coming to the hospitals to maintain a suitable level of social distancing, similar to that of the workforce scheduling scenario.",

An extended problem is presented in [275] , where the objective also includes minimizing the tardiness and additional skills and time constraints are considered.

In social distancing scenarios, scheduling techniques can help to regulate the traffic level, especially the number of pedestrians. In [279] , a novel scheduling algorithm is developed for traffic control, considering both vehicles and pedestrians, to minimize the delays. Similarly, a macroscopic model and a scheduling algorithm is proposed for traffic control that jointly minimize both the pedestrians and vehicle delays in [280] . Another scheduling approach is proposed in [281] that considers both pedestrians and vehicles. Different from the previously mentioned approaches, this approach only focuses on minimizing pedestrian delay. Although there is a vast literature on traffic scheduling techniques, the social distancing implications have not been taken into account. For example, to maintain social distancing, a more meaningful objective would be to reduce/constrain the peak number of pedestrians on the street at the same time.",

Moreover, scheduling algorithms often are developed such that they are only efficient for their specific problems.

In [350] , the authors propose a contract theory-based mechanism to provide a higher reward for D2D-capable mobile users if they send the information to a requesting mobile user with a higher transmission data rate. Taking number of potential nearby mobile users in proximity, the authors in [351] introduce the same mechanism such that a mobile user will receive a higher payment if they can share the information to more nearby mobile users. Likewise, the same approach considering a higher reward for a mobile user who has shorter distances in sharing its information to nearby D2D pairs is presented in [352] . Inspired by the aforementioned works, we can consider the contract theory-based method along with D2D communications to encourage people to keep distances from other people/crowds. Specifically, mobile service providers can be subsidized/funded or requested by the government to provide incentives to their users to keep distance from others when they are in public. Specifically, a service provider can offer contracts to mobile users, as illustrated in Fig. 20(a) . Considering the current distances from the nearby mobile users and capability to inform them through D2D communications, those mobile users can obtain more rewards when they successfully keep a sufficient distance (e.g., at least 1.5 meters) from other people/users. A violation (e.g., getting closer than 1.5 meters to someone) can lead to \"penalty\" (e.g., losing part of the previous rewards).",

In [353] , the authors introduce a contract theory-based incentive mechanism in a crowdsourced wireless community network. In particular, the network operator offers contracts to network-sharing mobile users containing a Wi-Fi access price (for their nearby mobile users accessing the network sharing) and a subscription fee (for the network-sharing mobile users). Motivated from this work, we can also develop a contacttracing framework which allows a mobile user to broadcast his/her public identity to the nearby mobile users as long as their distances are within 1.5 meters. Then, the nearby mobile users can store this public identity in their close-contact log files including the time and location when they receive that public identity as shown in Fig. 20(b) . As a compensation for this information sharing, they need to pay a certain payment to the sharing mobile user correspondingly. In this way, when at least one of the mobile users in the log files is infected by the contagious disease, the mobile service provider can alert the mobile users with the log files to implement social distancing.",

In [354] , the authors present a tournament model-based incentive mechanism to encourage mobile users (with various performance ranks) connected to the local wireless networks, e.g., Wi-Fi hotspots, to send the location and unique identifier of the networks to the service provider ( Fig. 20(c) ). From the hotspots' location information, the service provider can then determine the people density in each hotspot area or the number of people in a building (which may have several hotspot areas). Using the above method, we can also encourage the mobile users to avoid non-essential public places, e.g., restaurants and shopping malls. In this case, the reward can be adapted according to the locations and essential level of the services (e.g., cinemas, restaurants, grocery stores, schools, and hospital).",

In fact, the contagious diseases, e.g., coronavirus, can remain on the surfaces for 4 hours up to several days [357] . Thus, avoiding traffic jam on the roads can reduce the possibility of the disease infection. In [358] , the authors propose a reward-based smartphone collaboration method to support data acquisition for location-based services. Specifically, a client will attract surrounding smartphone users, e.g., vehicular users on a highway, to collaborate together with the aim to build a big database containing location information as implemented in Google's Android smarphones and Apple's iPhone [359] . The joining smartphone users then receive shared rewards from the client considering their collaboration costs. Based on this database, the client can determine the traffic levels according to the vehicles' density on the roads dynamically. Then, the client can sell these information to a service provider which are further used to inform upcoming vehicular users avoid crowds on the roads for social distancing implementation. 4) Location/Movement Sharing Stay-at-home Encouragement: To further drive people away from high density public places, we can also consider incentive mechanisms for better social distancing efficiency (especially for the people with their mobile devices). In particular, the authors in [360] study the uneven distribution of the crowdsourcing participants when maximizing the social welfare of the network. To address this problem, a movement-based incentive mechanism to stimulate the participants move from popular areas to unpopular ones was introduced. This approach guarantees that the participants will announce their actual costs for further reward process. Likewise, an incentive mechanism in spatial crowdsourcing considering budget constraints to reduce imbalanced data collection is discussed in [361] . Particularly, the service provider will provide a higher reward when the mobile users are willing to participate at the remote locations instead of nearby locations where they belong to (based on their daily routines). A similar work utilizing a redistribution algorithm to incentivize crowdsourced service providers from oversupplied areas to undersupplied ones is also investigated in [327] . The above works are then extended in [362] . Instead of encouraging mobile users to completely move to faraway locations, the service provider will offer a task-bundling containing the nearby and remote tasks for each participating mobile user. All of these works show that the proposed incentive mechanisms can efficiently balance the various location popularity such that we can encourage people move to less density places.",

For example, the authors in [363] propose a spatio-temporal-based incentive mechanism using both smartphone and human intelligence in an ad hoc social network. This framework allows a very large crowd to work together in providing information sharing, i.e., geo-tagged multimedia resources, while receiving incentives from the system. Based on this method, we can also engage the vulnerable/at-risk groups to isolate themselves and deliver incentives for them at a certain location during a particular period (Fig. 20(d) ). The larger number of vulnerable/at-risk members in a group, the higher incentives will be given. Furthermore, we can design a real-time incentive mechanism to encourage people to implement self-isolation through providing more rewards for those who spend more time at a given location, e.g., at home. In this case, the reward can be negative, i.e., penalty, to discourage people from going to crowded places.",

            "text": "An occasional pandemic outbreak in a particular period can drive the mobile service providers, e.g., Google and Apple, to build up a pandemic mode application for current users' mobile devices, e.g. smartphones. This application represents a comprehensive framework utilizing the current pandemic situation, i.e., infected movement data, to help the mobile users stay aware of the contagious diseases and perform cautious actions to slow down the spread of the diseases through implementing social distancing. To this end, the use of users' smartphones is very crucial to realize this pandemic mode application as similarly implemented for smartphone-based disaster mode application in [297] - [303] . When a contagious disease outbreak is imminent, the government can first broadcast an urgent notification for mobile users to install/deploy the official pandemic mode application in their smartphones. Then, based on the current infected movement data, e.g., current reported number of infected people and current infected areas, from the government officials, the service providers can determine the risk levels of the pandemic and activate a certain level in the smartphones. Considering the risk level, the smartphones can leverage the existing sensors and wireless connections to perform effective contact tracing activity for contagious disease containment. 1) Infected Movement Data: To determine the risk levels of pandemic mode, the service providers first need to monitor the current infected movement information, i.e., infected areas and number of infected people. Based on this observation, the service providers then can orchestrate the pandemic mode risk levels and notify mobile users such that they can avoid the areas where the highly-likely infection exists according to the current risk level. In [304] , the authors introduce an identification framework to observe the spatial infection spread based on the arrival records of infectious cases in subpopulation areas. Considering susceptible and infectious people movement in metapopulation networks, the framework first splits the whole infection spread into disjoint subpopulation areas. Then, a maximum likelihood estimation is applied to predict the most likely invasion pathways at each subpopulation area. Using a dynamic programming-based algorithm, the framework can finally reconstruct the whole spread by iteratively assembling the invasion pathways for each subpopulation to produce the final invasion pathways. Then, the authors in [305] present a spatial-temporal technique to locate realtime influenza epidemics utilizing heterogeneous data from the Internet. In particular, the technique constructs a multivariate hidden Markov model through aggregating influenza morbidity data, influenza-related data from Google, and international air transportation data. This aims to identify the spatialtemporal relationship of influenza transmission which will be used for surveillance application. Through experimental results, the technique can predict an influenza epidemic ahead of the actual event with high accuracy. Recently, Google and Apple also create a framework to demonstrate the community mobility trend with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak [307] , [309] . In particular, this framework is generated based on the regions of mobile users and change in visits monitoring at various public places, e.g., groceries, pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas.",

Based on these disease spread levels, the service providers can customize the pandemic mode risk level for different regions, e.g., states, cities, and provinces, at different times. For example, if the disease spread level, e.g., the density of infected people, at a particular city is high, the service providers can set the pandemic mode into high-risk level for a week (as shown in Fig. 21) . Otherwise, the pandemic mode level can be set at low-risk level.",

Afterwards, the smartphones can perform contact tracing to help quickly discovering infected people for efficient outbreak containment [310] , [311] . Based on the risk level of the pandemic mode, the smartphones can automatically trace contacts using certain sensors and wireless connections. For example, Google and Apple currently collaborate together to develop a contact tracing application utilizing Bluetooth technology, aiming to quickly detect the past contacts among mobile users in a close proximity [312] . In this case, the Bluetooth is used to exchange beacon signals containing unique keys between two smartphones prior to storing these keys to the cloud server for infected people notification. Similarly, the work in [313] develops a wireless sensor system to exchange beacon signals between a mobile device with other nearby mobile devices as its contact information. In another work, an epidemiological data collection scheme utilizing users' smartphones is described in [314] . Specifically, a user's smartphone can be used as a sensor platform to collect high accurate information including user's location, activity level, and contact history between the user and certain locations. Then, a smartphonebased contact detection system leveraging the smartphone's magnetometer history is investigated in [315] . To determine the close contact, the system measures the linear correlation between two smartphones' magnetometer records.",

The scenarios can be briefly classified as follows: \u2022 Keeping distance: In these scenarios, various positioning and AI technologies can assist in keeping distance between people. Based on that, when a person gets too close to another or a crowd, the person can be alerted (e.g., by smartphones). \u2022 Real-time monitoring: Many positioning and AI technolo-Incentive: Social distancing has negative impacts on personal freedom and the economics. Therefore, incentive mechanisms are needed to encourage people to comply with social distancing measures (e.g., incentivize people to share their movement data and self-isolate). Optimization techniques and technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular can also support those incentive mechanisms. \u2022 Scheduling: Various scheduling techniques can be employed to increase the efficiency of workforce and home healthcare service scheduling, thereby decreasing the number of employees at workplaces and patients at hospitals. Moreover, scheduling techniques can also be applied for traffic control to reduce the number of vehicles and pedestrians on the street. Furthermore, technologies such as Wi-Fi, RFID, and Zigbee can be applied for building access scheduling. \u2022 AI: AI technologies can be employed for social distancing data mining. The results can help to predict the future trends and movement of the infected and susceptible individuals. The details of technologies used in social distancing scenarios are illustrated in",
