Here, we introduce a model based on the fundamental SIR equations with a stochastic disorder by a random exchange of infected populations between cities to study dynamics in an interacting network of epicentres in a model state. Although each stochastic exchange conserves populations pair-wise, the disorder drives the global system towards newer routes to dynamic equilibrium. Upon controlling the range of the exchange fraction, we show that it is possible to control the heterogeneity in the spread and the co-operativity among the interacting hotspots. Data of collective temporal evolution of the infected populations in federal states of Germany validate the qualitative features of the model.",

In recent years, similar coronavirus outbreak happened in 2003 (SERS-Cov) [7] and 2012 (MERS) [8] killing around a thousand people in China and the Middle east. Following that the outbreak of Ebola cost more than ten thousand lives in Africa [9] . After resulting in massacres in Europe, the pandemic has turned its head towards the United States where more than half of a million people have already been infected within a short span [10] . The complexity in understanding and estimating the spatial spread of the pandemic lies in the conflicting numbers of the rates at which the virus is transmitted to the neighbourhood [11] . Specifically, when multiple hotspots coexist together, only a few recursive events of local transmission turn into a catastrophic avalanche with dramatically increasing number of infections in a very short time window [12] . Moreover, the adaptability of the virus in ever-changing environments is also surprising [13] . Thus, identification of the true character and the self-organization of the epidemic has emerged as one of the biggest global challenges in human history. This is pivotal to develop non-pharmaceutical antidotes with sophisticated intervention strategies to control the dispersal of the pandemic until some clinical solutions arrive in support [14] .",

Since an effective model requires the prior knowledge of transmission and recovery rates, it is almost impossible to estimate them in the midway of an epidemic, for the rates depend on the nature of instantaneous social preparedness that vary locally. For instance, Germany had three major infected regions, Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia which had roughly twenty thousand cases in each of these federal states on average by the first week of April [16] . In contrast, the other neighbouring states, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Hesse had surprisingly smaller numbers [16] .

We consider a model state consisting of multiple cities that exchange infected populations pair-wise stochastically where the local dynamics in the individual cities are governed by the deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with instantaneously or regularly updated populations. Moreover, the order of the random exchange of the infected populations is controlled by a connectivity parameter. We show that tuning the connectivity parameter, it is possible to control the cooperativity of the infection propagation. However, the heterogeneity in the cooperativity determines controls over the outbreak. We validate the qualitative features of the model with the data of the heterogeneous evolution of COVID-19 in different provinces of Germany. We discuss further possibilities of development.",

In the middle panels of Fig. 1 , we show the evolution of Infected and Recovered population for \u03b7 = 0.5. We see heterogeneity in the infection propagation: Not only the peaks appear in different times in the different cities, but also the height of the peaks in I i become distinct for each city. The dynamic equilibrium is attained when I i \u2192 0 for all i simultaneously at sufficiently long time after the individual peaks in the infected populations in the cities are observed. These effects become more prominent for lower \u03b7. For \u03b7 = 0, the exchange is completely uncontrolled as individual cities do not have any restriction in retaining the fraction of infected population. Hence, the distributions of both I and R become more diffused as shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 1 . Now for all these cases, we look at the time evolution of the probability distribution of the infected populations, P (I; t) with increasing t. In Fig. 2 , we show the evolution of P (I; t) for different cases of \u03b7. As there is a tiny population of infected population in the beginning due to the initial condition, the distribution at t = 0, P (I; 0) \u2248 \u03b4(I(0)) for all values of \u03b7. For \u03b7 = 1, as individual cities show a peak at t \u2248 50, the delta peak of P (I) also shifts to higher values of I (Fig. 2.(a.2) ). Since all the cities behave identically for \u03b7 = 1, there is no spread in the distributions for all t. At higher t when the infected population \u2192 0, the distribution again shifts to smaller values of I( Fig.2(a.3) ).",

The trend in the statistical correlation behaves non-monotonically in the period, with a dip on 23rd March when the peak in \u03c3 \u00b5 appeared, reiter- ating the effect of heterogeneity due to lack of dynamical statistical correlation. Surprisingly, the date exactly matches the date of the beginning of the lockdown in Germany. From the first week of April, there is a clear trend of flattening of the curve with significantly smaller number of cases with respect to the maximum numbers recorded on 27th March. Always, there are continuous exchanges of populations between the provinces in a country unless any intervention is imposed. The mobility between the cities without restriction, in principle resembles the \u03b7 = 0 case of the model while the situation with strict intervention behaves as \u03b7 = 1 case of the model when the cities are considered isolated. Considering time dependence in \u03b7, it is possible to realize a dynamic picture from pre to post lockdown situations. The behaviour of \u03c3/\u00b5 qualitatively features the balance between the spread of the infection in the cities and the relative change in the collective spread of the epidemic in the state. The extremum in \u03c3/\u00b5 captures the extreme heterogeneity in the infection propagation as it optimize the relative balance between the local spread and drive in the collective transmission. On this note, the model that we use delivers the similar qualitative feature of the data of COVID-19 cases in the states of Germany.",

Also, possibilities of further customization needs system specific details and the set of governing equations where specific rules of death, quarantine or hospitalization counts could be considered in addition.
