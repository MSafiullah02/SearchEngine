Neurosurgery is very specialized care, dealing with severe cases and high rates of emergencies that cannot be interrupted during the COVID-19 crisis. Africa does not have many neurosurgeons. In Morocco, neurosurgical care is centralized in major cities, mainly within university hospitals. Rabat counts only 2 neurosurgical civilian public departments in 2 different hospitals that drain emergency cases in the region and 1 other neurosurgical department in a private hospital. Both public departments embraced the same aim to isolate neurosurgical patients from the COVID-19 pathway. One department was shut down and reserved for COVID-19 patients, with the additional benefit of reducing intensive care unit solicitation by neurosurgical cases. All public neurosurgical activity was then transferred to the second department, where activity was limited to urgent cases to allow the neurosurgical team to manage patients without being overwhelmed. Finally, a turnover of the medical staff was installed in the early phase of this outbreak to help protect the medical forces to face this tragedy.",
