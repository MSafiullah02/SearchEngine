The four biosafety levels (BSL), as shown in Chapter 13, are BSL 1\u2014basic; BSL 2\u2014basic; BSL 3\u2014containment; and BSL 4\u2014maximum containment. Biosafety level designations are based on a composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices, and operational procedures required for working with agents from the various risk groups. Table 18.2\nrelates but does not \u201cequate\u201d risk groups to the biosafety level of laboratories designed to work with organisms in each risk group. Different countries (regions) draw up their own national (regional) classification of microorganisms, by risk group, taking into account:1.pathogenicity of the organism;2.mode of transmission and host range of the organism (These may be influenced by existing levels of immunity in the local population, density, and movement of the host population, presence of appropriate vectors, and standards of environmental hygiene.);3.local availability of effective preventive measures (These may include prophylaxis by immunization or administration of antisera (passive immunization); sanitary measures, eg, food and water hygiene; control of animal reservoirs or arthropod vectors.);4.local availability of effective treatment (This includes passive immunization, postexposure vaccination and use of antimicrobials, and antivirals and chemotherapeutic agents, and should take into consideration the possibility of the emergence of drug-resistant strains.).\n",

Fig. 18.1\nshows the international warning sign of biohazard. Local languages must be adopted to ensure the message can be understood. The assignment of a pathogenic agent to a biosafety level for laboratory work must be based on a risk assessment. Such an assessment will take the risk group as well as other factors into consideration in establishing the appropriate biosafety level. For example, an agent that is assigned to risk group 2 may generally require biosafety level (BSL) 2 facilities, equipment, practices, and procedures for safe conduct of work. However, if particular experiments require the generation of high-concentration aerosols, then BSL 3 may be more appropriate to provide the necessary degree of safety, since it ensures superior containment of aerosols in the laboratory workplace. The biosafety level assigned for the specific work to be done is, therefore, driven by professional judgment based on a risk assessment, rather than by automatic assignment of a laboratory biosafety level according to the particular risk group designation of the pathogenic agent to be used. Table 18.3\nsummarizes the facility requirements at the four biosafety levels.",

A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within 5 min after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.);4.\nflammable solid, which is one that is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction (Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances, which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. They are further divided into(a)flammable solids,(b)polymerizing substances, and(c)self-reactive substances, ie, thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing. Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within 5 min after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without heat supply, is liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances that on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component that is classified as flammable.);\n5.\noxidizing substances and organic peroxides, which contain category 1 oxidizing substances and category 2 organic peroxides, organic liquids or solids that contain the bivalent \u2013O\u2013O\u2013 structure and may be considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide, where one or both of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic radicals (The term also includes organic peroxide formulations (mixtures).

Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single irritant category. For those authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for skin irritation, an additional mild irritant category is provided.\u2022\nSerious eye damage means the production of tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical decay of vision, following application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized category.\u2022\nEye irritation means changes in the eye following the application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized hazard category. For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days.\u2022\nRespiratory sensitizer means a substance that induces hypersensitivity of the airways following inhalation of the substance. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.\u2022\nSkin sensitizer means a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for \u201cskin sensitizer\u201d is equivalent to \u201ccontact sensitizer.\u201d Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.\u2022\nGerm cell mutagenicity means an agent giving rise to an increased occurrence of mutations in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.\u2022\nCarcinogenicity means a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances that induces cancer or increases its incidence.

Materials that cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate category, \"Effects on or via Lactation.\"\u2022\nSpecific target organ toxicity (STOT) category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for target organ effects. All significant health effects not otherwise specifically included in the GHS that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed are included in the nonlethal target organ/systemic toxicity class. Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure. Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories. Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories.\u2022\nAspiration hazard includes severe acute effects such as chemical pneumonia, varying degrees of pulmonary injury, or death following aspiration. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the trachea and lower respiratory system.

One can infer that chemical reactivity hazards can be categorized as follows:1.\nSelf-reacting or unstable chemicals. A single unstable compound can undergo uncontrolled decomposition, rearrangement, or polymerization. For example, organic peroxides can pose fire and explosion hazards.2.\nRunaway reactions. Intended reactions of chemicals to produce desired products can become uncontrollable. For example, the reaction of phenol with formaldehyde to produce phenolic resins is subjected runaway.3.\nIncompatibilities. Inadvertent mixing of two or more process chemicals may lead to an unintended chemical reaction. For example, mixing acids with cyanide salts generates highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas, and mixing silver salts with ammonia in the presence of a strong base may generate an explosively unstable solid. Also, process chemicals may react with materials present in the process such as water, air, materials of construction, lubricating oils, utility fluids, and so on. For example, acetylene reacts with copper to form explosive compounds, and phosgene reacts corrosively with stainless steel, which may result in loss of containment.\n",

The 2015 explosion in the port city of Tianjin, China, for example, shows improper storage of chemicals (in this case, nitrocellulose and ammonium nitrate) can cause extreme harm. Over 100 lives lost to the explosion. For all potential runaway reactions, heat loss possibility and environmental conditions are important, and therefore, scale is important.

A reactive material in a smaller vessel will be stable to a higher temperature than the same material in a larger vessel. The same sample may be safe in a beaker or drum, but may run away in a tanker causing an explosion. A battery may be stable as a single unit, but as a battery pack in a black-cased notebook alongside heat-producing electronic components, heat output may raise the battery temperature causing disintegration and fire. To simulate the real-life or large-scale scenario, the sample under investigation must be in an environment without heat loss (or gain). The temperature where the heat production exceeds the heat loss is the temperature of no return (TNR). There is not just one TNR, this value will change as heat-loss potential changes.

UV irradiation, reactor wall surface construction, and high temperature (or heat) are common methods of promoting the initiation step.",

A bottle of an organic chemical is perfectly safe for centuries if the cap is impermeable to oxygen and is kept tightly fastened. (A cork is not a suitable cap.) However, one never knows whether someone may have left the cap off or loose for some time to allow the peroxide to form significantly.3.This reaction depends crucially on the initiation step, and different molecules have vastly different capabilities of dissociation. The major problem here is that the initiation step can be initiated by a trace amount of an impurity that no one knows is in the bottle. As examples, all tertiary C\u2014H bonds are fairly weak, as are the C\u2014H bonds in aldehydes and alkenes. The reaction can be initiated by traces of these compounds, and the chain is propagated throughout all molecules in the otherwise quite unreactive liquid.4.The initiation step can be photoinduced. If a bottle is sitting in sunlight, UV photons (fluorescent lights are also more dangerous than incandescent lights) can cause photodissociation to initiate the chain reaction much faster than in the dark. This is the reason why many chemicals are sold in brown bottles.\n",

            "text": "The behavior of the reactor can be simulated with Eqs. (E18.2.7) and (E18.2.8).(a)Isothermal Operation in the First 45 minWe first simulate the reaction isothermally at 175\u00b0C for the first 45 min until the time the cooling was turned off. For isothermal operations, the reaction rate coefficient is constant as it changes only with temperature as shown in Eq. (E18.2.6), k\n = 0.0001167 m3/(kmol\u22c5min) at 175\u00b0C. Eq. (E18.2.7) can be integrated analytically to yield(E18.2.11)t=1kCB0\u22122CA0lnCB0\u22122CA0fACB01\u2212fA\nor(E18.2.12)fA=1\u2212expkCB0\u22122CA0t2CA0/CB0\u2212expkCB0\u22122CA0t\nSubstituting the parameters, one obtains f\nA\n = 0.0336 at t\n = 45 min.At exactly 45 min, the heat of generation as defined by Eq. (E18.2.10) is given byHG=\u2212rAV\u2212\u0394HR=3882kcal/min\nThe maximum cooling available for the heat of removalHR,max=UAHT\u2212Ta\u226435.85\u00d7175\u201325kcal/min=5377.5kcal/min\nwhich is more than sufficient to control the temperature in the reactor. One can conclude that the explosion would not have happened if the cooling were not turned off.(b)Adiabatic Operation for the Next 10 minThe cooling was turned off from the time of 45 to 55 min. We now solve Eqs. (E18.2.7) and (E18.2.8) with ODEXLLIMS, noting that the initial conditions aret=45min;fA=0.0336;T=175+273.15K\nand UA\nH\n = 0.At the end of the 55 min, the solution is given by f\nA\n = 0.0430 and T\n = 468.16 K = 190\u00b0C. Correspondingly, H\nG\n = 6569.4 kcal/min and H\nR,max\n = 6094.8 kcal/min. The point of no return has been reached already for the reactor is set to fail should it continue to operate. The temperature is going to rise even if maximum cooling is applied from this point on.(c)Batch Operation With Heat ExchangeContinue the simulation from Part b, but let UA\nH\n = 35.85 kcal/(min\u22c5\u00b0C). The reactor conditions at the end of the adiabatic operations become the initial conditions for the batch operation with cooling capacity back online. The initial conditions to be used with the ODEXLims aret=55min;fA=0.043009;T=468.1589K\nand UA\nH\n = 35.85 kcal/(min\u22c5\u00b0C).\nFig. E18.2.2\nshows the simulated temperature profile for the reactor operation. We can observe that the temperature continued to rise. More clearly, from Fig. E18.2.3\n, by 110 min (or 10:45 pm), the reactor temperature had reached 515.49 K or 242.3\u00b0C. The temperature began increasing even more rapidly after this point. One can observe that 120 min after the batch reactor was started, the temperature increased sharply and the reactor exploded at a few minutes before midnight. If the mass and heat capacity of the stirrer and reaction vessel had been included, \u03a3niC\nPi term would have increased by about 5% and extended the time until the explosion occurred by 15 min or so, which would predict the actual time of the explosion at 12:18 am.When the temperature reached 300\u00b0C, a secondary reaction, the decomposition of nitroaniline to noncondensable gases, such CO, N2, and NO2, occurs releasing even more heat. The total energy released was estimated to be 6.8 \u00d7 109\n J, which is enough energy to lift the entire 2500 Mg building 277 m straight up.(d)Disk RuptureThe pressure relief disk should have ruptured when the temperature reached 265\u00b0C or 538.15 K (ca. 700 psi), but it did not and temperature continued to rise. If it had ruptured, the liquid water would have vaporized, a maximum of 106\n kcal would have been drawn from the reaction mixture, thereby lowering the temperature and quenching it.If the disk had ruptured at 265\u00b0C (700 psi), the maximum mass flow rate out of the 2-in orifice to the atmosphere (1 atm) would have been 830 kg/min at the time of rupture. This leads to a maximum heat removal ofQ=m.\u0394Hvap+UAHT\u2212Ta=830kg/min\u00d7540kcal/kg+35.85kcal/K\u00d7265\u201325=456804kcal/min\nwhich is much greater that the heat generation at that time H\nG\n = 26520.8 kcal/min. The reaction could have easily been quenched.\n",

The GHS label includes the substance name, ID, eye-catching pictograms to show potential dangers, plus warnings and descriptions on how to handle it.
