Firstly, healthcare workers are at a great risk of infection due to the production of aerosol during the sampling. Secondly, the quality of NP swabs is inconsistent between collections, which may lead to the occurrence of false-negative results. Thirdly, patient may experience discomfort, including pain, itchy and bleeding, during the sampling. The biggest advantage of sputum specimen is its noninvasive characteristics, but only 28% of patients with COVID-19 have sputum symptom [3] .",

However, the other 5 paired samples got inconsistent results, of which the throat washing specimen showed positive and the NP swabs presented negative results.

In spite of the high positive detection rate, the risk of exposure to 2019-nCoV did not improve by using NP swabs samples. Moreover, as we mentioned before, the application of NP swab was limited for its own disadvantages. Sputum was a useful non-invasive method for the detection of 2019-nCoV, but still confined to the occurrence of sputum. Induced-sputum was identified as an unsafe inappropriate specimen for the production of aerosol [7] . Therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel optimal sampling plan.",
