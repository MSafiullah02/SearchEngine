The San Giuliani event measured only Richter 4.8 but destroyed a school, killing 26 children and four teachers. The building's collapse was blamed on the addition of two storeys without strengthening of the shallow foundations and block walls. While investigations initially focussed on whether the extension complied with building regulations, a subsequent government inquiry was asked to address the area's seismic classification. A 1998 government report had stated that the whole region should be considered a seismic risk zone but by the time of the November 2002 earthquake, no official classification had been issued. The chief engineer of the Italian seismic survey noted that none of the buildings in the village were designed for seismic loading. A civil engineer at the Italian Department for Civil Protection is reported as saying that many areas in Italy used similar construction methods to those in San Giuliano Di Puglia, transposing, in effect, equal levels of risk. As geologists, we are getting much better at analyzing seismic risk; but it would appear that persuading governments to act on such analyses remains a problem.",

The Czech Republic estimated flood damage or destruction of 30 motorway and trunk-road bridges plus the same fate for more than 130 secondary-road bridges. In addition, 120 km of trunk road and 780 km of secondary roads were deemed unusable without repairs. In Prague, the river burst its banks and the metro system was flooded. It is expected that one quarter of the flooded buildings in the city will have to be demolished. Throughout the Czech Republic, it is anticipated that as many as 24 months will be needed to repair all the damage. This is a story repeated in many countries and illustrates the importance of long-term climate prediction in all future foundation and flood protection design work.

Sharply reduced funding for training, especially at postgraduate level, was also regarded as a major long-term concern. In a lead article in Ground Engineering (April 2002), the in-coming Chairman of the Engineering Group of the Geological Society addressed the issue of the skills shortage, citing earlier economic downturns that had forced senior staff into premature retirement. Other factors were the relatively poor salaries in the arena of practice, as well as other better-paying employment alternatives available to good science and engineering graduates. This message was repeatedly emphasised throughout the ground engineering literature. Until the construction industry is able to compete in terms of financial reward for the best graduates, the sector will continue to loose out.",

The challengers are in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Washington, DC, the favorite place of challenge of anti-management environmental movements. The suit argues that this attempt to place HLW in a national repository is flawed in terms of the Constitution, regulatory rules, and scientific concepts of environmental protection. The group aims next to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in the event that they are not successful in blocking the highly needed repository.

Wirth equipment has been used on its Tunnel Bore Extender (TBE) at Uetilberg, Switzerland, near Zurich, to expand its bore from an unlined 5 m to a final bore of 14.4 m (World Tunneling, 2003a). Each push-advance of the TBE is limited to only 20 cm forward, but the advance is completed in only 8 to 10 rotations of the head. The host rock is relatively weak-rock flysch. Cutter heads are mounted on six arms and each cutter furrow is tracked by an appropriate displaced cutter on the next cutter arm, thus shearing the rock to failure along a weakly positioned ridge and furrow pattern. The entire TBE trails 180 m, making it extremely long by way of comparison to most TBMs. Judging from the schematic diagram, tunnel geologists should have adequate observation space for wall mapping during progress.",

Most of these boards have traditionally been staffed through closed-\u201cnetwork\u201d selection. Now, California's Department of Water Resources has formally advertised for an Engineering Geology Consultant and a Geotechnical Engineer for its Dyer Reservoir Independent Consulting Board. We hope that this is a sign of truly \u201copen\u201d selection.",

Scenarios for human-receptor exposure are developed to match competing \u201calternatives\u201d for selection as the objectives for remediation and closure of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Most geologists regard the concept as being highly flawed because Responsible Parties are allowed, to a degree, to design and conduct their own site and waste characterization, the results of which then form the basis for subsequent risk analyses. Again, this is a grand example of the fox guarding the chicken coop. For our concern, the US DOE has chosen \u201crisk-based end-state visions\u201d as its process to examine proposed and completed site remediation efforts. The question remains: how complete and accurate were the site and waste characterization efforts? Was the effort bid-shopped?!",

Buckminster Fuller (1895\u20131983), architectural engineer developer of the geodesic dome, also brought organic chemists to discover the propensity of carbon-ring molecular structures to form significantly large \u201cfullerene\u201d cages resembling the form of soccer balls. We think that this chemistry will unfold to explain much about the now-unknown species of PAHs and associated carcinogenicity. There will be much for application here by Engineering Geologists working in the field of environmental pollution. Further treatments suggest that substitution of sulfur and nitrogen atoms may open up windows or doors in fullerenes capable of capturing and secreting the large H2 atom, which has tremendous implications for cheap energy sources. At the same time, the cautious doomsayers of environmental chemistry are suggesting that combustion of hydrogen-entrapping carbon fullerenes will create excess water vapor in the atmosphere and that will extend the hole in the ozone layer.",

The quantities are huge, and elemental chemistry of the wastes, largely dependent upon the lithologic nature of the feedstock coal, can harm groundwater quality through released leachate. Now we are pleased to learn of a multinational effort (EMC Cement, Amsterdam, Verbier, Switzerland, and Ready Mix Concrete, Jasper, TX) will begin to produce a fly ash pozzolan alternative to Portland cement (http://www.fewreadymix.com) containing 90\u201395% fly ash as calcium silicate hydrate as hardened concrete. EMC claims the concrete will harbor fewer microfractures on shrinkage and will be cost-competitive. This innovation could recycle huge quantities of fly ash and reduce the open-pit recovery of limestone as well.",
