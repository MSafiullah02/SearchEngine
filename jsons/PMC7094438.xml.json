            "text": "\nNeospora caninum infection was first reported in dogs with skin lesions and systemic pathology in 1988 (McAllister et al., 1998). Canine neosporosis must be distinguished from disease caused by morphologically similar protozoal agents such as Toxoplasma gondii and Hammondia hammondi (Lindsay and Dubey, 2000, Dubey, 2003, Dubey et al., 2006). Dogs and coyotes are the only definitive hosts of N. caninum, shedding the oocysts following enteroepithelial schizogony and gametogony (McAllister et al., 1998, Lindsay et al., 1999). Several reports describe the shedding of N. caninum oocysts in the faeces of naturally infected dogs (Lindsay and Dubey, 2000, Dubey, 2003, Gondim et al., 2005, Dubey and Schares, 2011). Oocyst shedding is also reported in experimental studies; for example, puppies given calf brains and avian chorio-allantoic membranes containing N. caninum infective stages shed millions of oocysts for 2\u20133 days in their faeces (Cedillo et al., 2008, Munhoz et al., 2013). Although it is likely that the enteroepithelial stages of N. caninum develop in the dog intestine, neither schizogony nor gametogony have yet been demonstrated in this tissue.",

Primary N. caninum monoclonal antibody (210/70 NC, VMRD Inc., Pullman, Washington, USA) was added at a dilution of 1 in 10,000 for 60 min. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody, labelled with horseradish peroxidase and, finally, AEC chromogen\u2013substrate solution. Serial sections were examined for T. gondii antigen using polyclonal rabbit anti-T. gondii antibody (Haziroglu et al., 2003) and for canine parvovirus (CPV) antigen using commercial monoclonal antibody (SC-57961; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, California, USA). Positive control slides included sections of the brain of an N. caninum-infected calf, the liver of a T. gondii-infected mouse and the ileum of a dog with CPV infection. For negative controls, phosphate buffered saline was used instead of each primary antibody and normal mouse serum was used as a control for N. caninum and CPV antibodies.",

In the ileum, there were erosions of the epithelial layer with villous atrophy and fusion. The crypts were atrophic, cystic and necrotic in appearance. In the lamina propria there was marked infiltration of eosinophils and macrophages in addition to congestion and multifocal haemorrhages. These lesions were suggestive of CPV; however, numerous schizont-like and oocyst-like structures were also observed in the intestinal mucosa and crypt epithelia (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). In some areas, crypt epithelium contained granular structures (10\u201315 \u03bcm) on the apical side of the cells (Fig. 3\n). These schizont-like structures showed pale blue granular staining on Masson's trichrome stain and were PAS negative. Immunohistochemically, they were strongly labelled for Neospora antigen. Additionally, IHC revealed numerous developmental stages characteristic of schizonts within necrotic debris and cystic crypts (Fig. 3). Weakly labelled microgamont-like structures were observed and these appeared as very small spots with flagella-like structures (Fig. 4\n). Intracellular oocysts also showed weak immunopositivity for N. caninum, but N. caninum antigen was not found in interstitial tissue. N. caninum antigen was also detected in degenerative neurons and in foci of necrosis in the lung and heart. There was no labelling for T. gondii or CPV antigens. The 224 base pair amplification products from PCR were consistent with the N. caninum Nc5 gene and all samples from the lungs, liver and spleen contained N. caninum DNA.",

            "text": "Since the first description of N. caninum oocysts in naturally infected dog faeces, several reports have described oocyst shedding as an important horizontal transmission route for intermediate hosts of neosporosis (McAllister et al., 1998, Lindsay et al., 1999, Dubey, 2003, Gondim et al., 2005, Dubey and Schares, 2011, Ocal et al., 2014). It has also been shown that dogs given N. caninum tachyzoites and tissue cysts may shed millions of oocysts after 2\u20138 days. However, though it is highly likely that asexual and sexual developmental stages of neosporosis probably take place in the small intestines of dogs, to date there is no report confirming the presence of those stages (Hemphill et al., 2009). An attempt to demonstrate schizogony and gametogony of N. caninum in in-vitro cultured canine duodenal cells also failed (Hemphill et al., 2009). In this duodenal cell culture model, Hemphill et al. (2009) inoculated N. caninum bradyzoites and tachyzoites onto the intestinal epithelium, but although the infective stages successfully entered the epithelial cells, particularly through the microvillus containing apical side, no stage conversion occurred during the 10 day incubation time. The authors concluded that this study should be repeated using an immortal duodenal cell line for prolonged times in order to observe stage conversion from tachyzoite to schizont.",

            "text": "\nT. gondii, which shows genetic and morphological resemblance to N. caninum, has been shown to have five different schizogony stages (A\u2013E) in the cat intestine. Stages A, B and C are the initial proliferative stages (30\u201340 \u03bcm in size) and they have been considered as temporary stages, while D and E schizonts are smaller (8\u201312 \u03bcm) and are seen just before stage conversion to gametocytes (Dubey, 2010). In the present case, schizogony stages observed in the ileal mucosa resembled type D and E schizonts of T. gondii. While schizonts were easily observed in the HE-stained slides, microgamonts were recognized only after IHC. However, macrogamonts of the parasite were not identified, even with PAS staining (Dubey, 2010). Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform an ultrastructural examination in this case. In the intestinal mucosa of this puppy, intraepithelial schizonts showed strong immunoreactivity for N. caninum while the immunoreaction was relatively weak in microgametocytes and oocysts. This difference can be explained by the different structural proteins expressed by the different developmental stages of the parasite. The commercial N. caninum antibody may have different affinity for common antigens shared by tachyzoites, microgamonts and schizonts. A previous report demonstrated that the intestinal developmental stages (e.g. schizont and gametocyte) of T. gondii may cross-react with tachyzoite-specific primary antibody in immunoperoxidase tests (Taka et al., 1999). Otherwise, the lack of labelling of interstitial macrophages and the epithelial localization of the protozoon is consistent with these stages not being tachyzoites (Dubey, 2010).",

There are no reports of pathological findings in the small intestine related to neosporosis. In the present case there were numerous schizonts of N. caninum within the intestinal epithelium and these were associated with epithelial necrosis, desquamation, villous atrophy and crypt necrosis. Severe mucosal lesions were also prominent clinically and on gross necropsy examination. The intestinal lesions were characterized as fibrinohaemorrhagic enteritis and the severity of the observed epithelial necrosis appeared to be related to the number of schizonts present. This mucosal damage caused by N. caninum resembles the intestinal lesions caused by other coccidian protozoons such as Eimeria spp. and Isospora spp. and T. gondii (Dubey et al., 2006, Dubey, 2010). Canine coronavirus and rotavirus infections can also cause mucosal lesions, but these viruses generally localize to the apical site of the epithelia and the mucosal lesions are frequently limited to epithelial desquamation and mild crypt necrosis.",
