Number of bats sampled in each parish TA B L E 1 Seropositivity for alpha and flavivirus antibodies in bats from Grenada", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "including the type, duration and protection of antibody responses generated to infection with specific zoonotic alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Further complicating the interpretation of serologic data on bats under natural conditions are coinfections, cross-reacting antibodies and lack of information on which viruses are currently circulating in a particular geographic area. Of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses included in the study reported here, only DENV and CHIKV are known to circulate in Grenada. ZIKV also occurs in Grenada (PAHO, 2017), but the bats were sampled prior to the introduction of the virus onto the island. The only other virus included in this study that has been evaluated for exposure in any animal in Grenada is WNV. In 2006, 45 donkeys were tested by WNV IgM ELISA and all were negative (Chikweto et al., 2008). Thus, other than DENV and CHIKV, there is limited information on which mosquito-borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses occur in Grenada. Chikungunya virus was introduced into Grenada in 2014, and the first documented human case was in May 2014 (PAHO, 2014, 2015, 2016). Serologic evidence of bat exposure to CHIKV needs to be interpreted with caution because of the possible cross-reactivity with Mayaro virus (MAYV), a related alphavirus endemic to Latin America (Garcia de Figueiredo & Figueiredo, 2014). Although serological cross-reactivity has been observed in human humoral immune responses, it remains unclear if a similar cross-reactivity occurs in bats", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "). Plaque reduction neutralization tests were performed using nine flaviviruses: Bussuquara virus (BSQV; strain BeAn-4073), dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1; strain Hawaii), dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2; strain NGC), dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3; strain H-87), dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4; strain 241), Ilh\u00e9us virus (ILHV; original strain), Rio Bravo virus (RBV; strain M64), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; strain TBH-28) and West Nile virus (WNV; strain NY99-35261-11). Bussuquara virus, ILHV, SLEV, WNV and the four DENV serotypes were obtained from the World Health Organization Center for Arbovirus Reference and Research at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado; RBV was obtained from the World Arbovirus Reference Collection at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston,Texas. Plaque reduction neutralization tests were performed in six-well plates using African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells.Sera were initially tested at a dilution of 1:20. Those that reduced the number of plaques by \u226580% (PRNT 80 ) were titrated. Final titres were expressed as the reciprocal of serum dilutions yielding \u226580% reduction in the number of plaques (PRNT 80 ). For aetiological diagnosis, the PRNT 80 antibody titre to the respective virus was required to be at least 4-fold greater than that of the other flaviviruses tested.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "The capture of bats was approved by the Grenada Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.
