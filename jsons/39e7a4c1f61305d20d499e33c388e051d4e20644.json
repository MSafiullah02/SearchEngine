In combination with recent evidence, both cases support the functional reframing of depression as the outcome of a stress-and exhaustion-related spiralling mechanism.",

Depression is a heterogeneous group of brain disorders with varied contextualized origins, complex genetics and a neurobiology that is not completely understood. The etiology is not elucidated, and particularly for adolescents there is an evidence gap (4, 7, 8) . The serendipitous discovery of first the tri-and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and later the stress-modulating serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) led successively to the catecholamine and monoamine hypotheses of depression (9) . In later years, reduced adult neurogenesis and changes in structural and functional neuronal plasticity have been linked to the onset and treatment opportunities of major depression (10, 11) . Genetic research has shown that there is not a single genetic cause for depression, and all known genetic factors combined only explain a limited percentage of the variance in clinical outcomes (12, 13) . The estimated heritability of depression is 35%-40%, indicating 60%-65% is explained by other factors, such as adverse life experiences (11, 14) . Researchers have turned to epigenetics to develop new forms of genetic and pharmacological modeling, in an effort to describe the etiology of depression better (15) . Despite many years of research by numerous investigators both in academia and industry, psychoactive targeted therapeutics with controllable and specific effects on the brain microcircuitry and chemistry did not and probably will not materialize due to the complex nature of mental disorders (16) . In order to open up our thinking about MDD we take up the challenge to reframe depression, specifically focusing on adolescents.",

The seven most commonly used interviews and self-report questionnaires together describe a heterogenous group of 52 symptoms, such as either high or low appetite, more or less sleep than usual, and a feeling of sadness (17) . This causes differences in diagnosis based on which scale is used (18) . The widely varying patterns in which these symptoms often present themselves (19, 20) , and the high occurrence of several comorbidities, such as anxiety, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorder, indicate that depression is not a homogenous disease, but a continuous, heterogeneous group of disorders associated with a wide variety of different risk factors (4, 8, (21) (22) (23) (24) .",

The stressor may be in the past (e.g. childhood maltreatment or trauma) (4, 50), or acutely (e.g. dealing with new life events). The initial response of people to stress is typically a coping mechanism aimed at exerting control over the stressor either by avoiding, reducing or predicting its occurrence. Examples of such efforts are the canceling of obligations or disengagement from social interaction (51) . The HPA axis exerts a fundamental role regulating both internal as external stimuli, integrating the physiopathological and behavioral dimensions of stress.

Preclinical experiments already hinted at a relation between the effectiveness of coping behavior, the effort involved and feedback on the development of gastric ulcers. Although coping efforts were effective, ulcers still developed when coping took more effort and less feedback was offered (52, 53) . Preclinical evidence indicated that chronic exposure to relatively mild stressors which rats can adapt to relatively easily (e.g. tilting the cage at a slight angle, emptying a water bottle in the cage, introducing new bedding material), ultimately resulted in the development of anhedonia (50) . The chronic character of having to cope with mild stressful events over and over again, and the lack of control over stressors, was sufficient for depressive symptoms to develop (54) . In a forced swimming test, rats who were dosed with psilocybin developed the coping technique of floating faster than other rats, indicating a window of behavioral flexibility (55) . Ketamine displayed the opposite effect, with more mobility (56) . We hypothesize that depressive behavior, specifically anhedonia and withdrawal, and the consequent loss of interest and enjoyment in usual activities, is an evolutionary mechanism to guard the organism against the exhaustion that may results from excessive or chronic coping behavior. As such, depressive behavior is both an expression of psychological pressure and a physiological precaution. This substantiates the entanglement of psychological and physiological factors in MDD.",

Similarly, depression could be the expression of a forced change in allocation of attention. Depressed patients are known to ruminate, or continually analyze their problems and relive their memories (24) . Anhedonia can be interpreted as a way to secure mental resources, by reducing the interest in distractions (20, 57) . Depression can be seen as an exaggerated social navigating coping mechanism, caused by an accumulation of stress and a spiral of unsuccessful adaptive behaviors which leads to exhaustion. By entering a depressive mode, the organism aims to guard itself from exhaustion. The challenge is to interfere with this mood-affecting spiralling mechanism (see Figure 1 ) to prevent depression from developing. Dealing with stress and potential exhaustion, as opposed to dealing with the symptoms of depression, could prove to be an effective treatment approach.",

Even defining depression subtypes based on symptoms has not helped (62). Despite guidelines and evidence-based interventions, treatment is still primarily based on trial and error (63, 64) , and primarily aimed at improving mood. Yet, between one third (65) to half (20, 66) of adult patients show no response to weeks of first line treatment with antidepressant drugs, and are advised to try a different antidepressant. Further, one third of all patients never reach a response after four lines of antidepressant treatment (65) . The current therapeutic shortcomings are the consequences of our lack of knowledge of causes, the underlying neurobiology and chemistry (67) , and risk factors that contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression. As a consequence, the treatment paradigms are oversimplified with little attention for preventive measures (68) .",

In response to increased recreational use, international legislation was introduced as part of the \"war on drugs,\" which brought an abrupt end to clinical research with these and similar substances in the 1970s (67, 69, 70, 72) .

Several psychedelics have shown to help depressive patients in a limited number of studies with small number of patients. The classic psychedelics, compounds such as LSD, psilocybin, and Ayahuasca, have diverse pharmacological profiles, including robust effects on the serotonergic system (67, 69, 72, 75) . A psychedelic not acting on the serotonergic system is the dissociative anesthetic ketamine, which in subanesthetic doses acts as an antagonist on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a type of glutamate receptor (56, 69, 76, 77) . Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment-resistant depression (78) , but ketamine has been and continues to be used offlabel to treat depression too (79) . This highlights that serotonergic activity, or even a mono-aminergic activity, is not required for the antidepressant effect of a psychedelic compound, further stressing the need for abandoning the old hypotheses. These hallucinogens, and the chemically related entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) may have a place in offering a positive experience to break the self-sustaining depressive state and allowing for introspection during psychotherapy to process stressful life-time experiences as a form of reverse medical engineering (80) .",

This positive experience allows for the temporary disintegration of existing networks, which in turn facilitates reprocessing of past emotions and introspection (67) . In turn, this improves the capacity to cope with stress (71) . Also, the use of a psychedelic in combination with a psychotherapeutic process could have long-term effects, counteracting the effect of a negative experience and disrupting the negative and \"downward spiralling\" compulsive thinking (72) .",

We started CBT to control her marihuana and alcohol abuse and prevent school dropout. We added medication in order to try to stabilize her mood with fluoxetine, an SSRI, which might also modulate stress. The medication initially seemed to have some effect but after two months there was a sharp mood drop, increased suicidality and aggravation of eating disorder symptoms. Eventually she had a body mass index of 16 kg/m 2 . The eating problems were mapped and analysed by an eating disorder specialist. The latter used a problem-solving approach and focused on both directive counseling and emotional support. The eating disorder specialist also advised to choose a medication with low risks of weight gain. The psychiatrist changed the medication to citalopram. Subsequently, the treatment team focused on teaching the patient how to cope with stressful situations and the associated anxiety. The stress appeared to be mainly caused by a feeling of lack of control. The patient turned out to have a high intelligence and learning ability, but also felt that she had no control over her learning process. She had not sufficiently developed social learning strategies in her early school years. In addition, there appeared to be an issue of individuation and separation problems. These problems got worse because it was almost impossible for her parents to let her develop in her own way due to the stress they had over her suicidal thoughts, drug use, and worsening physical condition due to bad eating habits. We decided on an additional family counseling approach to address these issues.",

She told the counselor she tried hard, but felt that she could not keep up in school; it was never good enough, no matter how hard she tried. The counselor estimated that the school level was appropriate for the level of intelligence of the patient. She had periods when her self-esteem was very low. During these periods she spent hours on her appearance, focusing on her hair and makeup. Her hair fell out as a result of these sessions. She could not stop herself, and always ended with self-harm. This in turn lowered her self-esteem and increased the experienced stress. She was locked in a downward spiral. Gradually her mood disorder worsened and made her passive.

We educated parents and school on how instructions might fit in better with her learning abilities and style.

We envision that in such situations more radical medical interventions are needed to first elevate patients from the depressive state into a state where learning new and effective coping strategies can take place. In these situations, psychedelics (e.g. ketamine) have proven to be effective to temporarily draw people out of a deep depressive state.

The recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCov (94)], has overwhelmed healthcare facilities with the high need for acute care. This puts a large psychological toll on the entire population, with high levels of stress (95) . Next to the risk of the many life events that can be expected in these situations, coping behavior-such as avoiding conflict, or searching social support-is often limited due to confinements that are put in place to prevent further spread. Furthermore, the lockdown situation and mass isolation at home in many countries may increase the risk of domestic violence and divorces. This could all lead to a rise in trauma-related stress disorders in the months and years to come.
