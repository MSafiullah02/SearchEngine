Although not objectively demonstrated, an initial viral insult is commonly described by patients prior to the development of CRS.

Another possible explanation may be the timing of sampling. As most viruses tested in the assay are shed from the nasopharynx up to 3 weeks after symptom resolution, it is possible that sampling occurred either during this time or early in the infection prior to symptom development.",

These are known to be most prevalent in winter and the early part of spring, an observation supported by this study. The method of this study has been described in detail elsewhere. 2 Briefly, in 2005, 2008 and 2015, we conducted a school-based questionnaire survey among two age groups: students in years 1-2 (age 6-8 years old) and in years 8-9 (age 13-15 years old). Schools were randomly selected to have a total of 1000 students for both age groups from each and all 47 prefectures in Japan. Questionnaires with an information sheet for parents were distributed through schools, and students returning their questionnaires to schools were judged as giving consent to participate. We used the Japanese version of ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) core questions for asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema to identify children with current and severe wheeze, rhino-conjunctivitis and eczema 3 (Table S1) . The overlap of the three allergic diseases among the two age groups in 2005 and 2015 is described in Figure 1 , by means of proportional Venn diagrams. Among 6-to 8-year-olds, although the prevalence of children with wheeze, eczema or both decreased between 2005 and 2015, the overall proportion with any allergic disease was similar (33.7% and 34.7%), due to the increase in children with rhino-conjunctivitis only (8.5%-12.5%). Similarly, among 13-to",

This highlights a clear shortfall of previous CRS virome studies that limited sampling to winter and spring.The mechanisms underlying the viral contribution to CRS are unknown. Similarly unknown is whether the higher rates of viral infection here observed are a cause or a consequence of CRS. CRS has been well established as a bacterial disease, encompassing bacterial overgrowth, superantigen and biofilm formation, and disruption of the microbiome.6 The link between the bacterial and viral hypothe-ses of CRS aetiopathogenesis may lie in the ability of viruses to prime the airways for bacterial infection. Viruses damage the epithelial barrier by increasing mucus production, reducing ciliary presence, and reducing tight junction expression. Viruses bind directly to bacteria and upregulate host cell surface molecules to facilitate bacterial-host adherence. Viruses hamper the innate immune system with effects on neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and impairment of natural killer, antigen presenting and T cell activity, leaving the mucosa at risk for bacterial invasion. Viruses alter temperature and variably exhaust or increase the availability of micronutrients, which can allow bacteria in planktonic and biofilm form to proliferate (References in Data S1). The general population, however, is subject to a near-constant onslaught from respiratory viruses but only 16% of individuals develop CRS. The link between these two entities may be related to the interferons (IFN) and their signaling pathways. These cytokines are expressed by almost all cells in response to pathogen invasion and play key roles in innate antiviral immunity. Deficient IFN responses to viral infection have been consistently demonstrated in asthma, a similar disease process to CRS, as well as in CRS itself. 7-9 We hypothesize this lack of early antiviral activity in patients with CRS may result in more frequent, severe, or persistent viral infections, paving the way for the bacterial invasion so critical for disease development. Further research, however, is required to clarify this hypothesis. Our results confirm a long-held suspicion that viruses are more common in CRS than in the general population. Viral presence is associated with more severe sinus disease measured by LMS and LKS. This has the potential to lead to exciting new developments in viral prophylaxis and antiviral therapy in the prevention and possible treatment of CRS. JH, Kim YS, Cho GS, et al.

The change in the prevalence of wheeze, eczema and rhino-conjunctivitis among Japanese children: Findings from 3 nationwide cross-sectional surveys between 2005 and 2015 To the Editor, It has been suggested that the global increase in prevalence of allergic disease since the 1980s, also observed in Japan, may have reached a plateau or even decreased in some areas. 1 The analysis of time trends in the prevalence requires the use of the same methodology at each time point. We have carried out a nationwide study in 2005, 2008 and 2015 using a validated questionnaire and a similar sampling method at each time point to investigate the changing prevalence of allergic disease among Japanese children.",
