The majority of retrospective reports related to transfusion From the 1 US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Detrick, Maryland; the 2 Office of Naval Research, ratios examined the ratio at 24 hours after admission. Subsequent reports suggested that it was not just the overall ratio that was important, but the early ratio, and that the survival benefit was achieved in the first 6 hours after injury. [3] [4] [5] Although retrospective and observational data were promising, the lack of prospective data on transfusion ratios raised the question of whether the observed effects were the result of survival bias, rather than a true effect of the transfusion ratio. 6 The issue of the potential need for early transfusion of plasma is of particular importance to the military, especially when one considers that movement of casualties to traditional hospital facilities may be significantly delayed due to distance, terrain, mission, or other factors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 217, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 504, "end": 505, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1017, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1021, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1025, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1278, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IMPORTANCE OF PLASMA IN COMBAT TRAUMA"}, {"text": "Hemorrhage is the leading cause of potentially preventable deaths on the battlefield. 7 Casualties with hemorrhagic shock often receive blood transfusions at forward positioned hospitals and surgical teams.

Of these, nearly 110,000 units were fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). Delivering blood products where needed on the battlefield presents a significant logistic challenge for the military. FFP for military use is collected at US blood centers and shipped thousands of miles to the military point of use. This requires cold chain management over vast distances. 2 The problem of bag breakage and loss of FFP during shipment has been significant, at times up to 40%. Before use, FFP must be thawed, a process that takes approximately 30 minutes. Once thawed, it must be refrigerated and used within 5 days. This presents challenges in inventory management and surge capacity when casualties requiring massive transfusion may arrive with little notice. Generally, FFP is only available where adequate freezers, refrigerators, thawing equipment, and electrical supply can be positioned and maintained. This limits availability in austere combat areas, at sea, and during aeromedical evacuation.

Each of the pathogen reduction and drying technologies have an impact on the profiles of coagulation factors and hemostatic balance, 15, 18, 19 and these must be carefully managed in manufacturing development. It is clear that safe and effective products can be produced using the various methods. 14, 15, 20 The DoD programs are targeted at meeting a set of performance variables designed to make distribution, storage and use of plasma in austere environments much more feasible. Target product characteristics are shown in Table 2 . An additional common requirement is to avoid glass bottles and to produce packaging that can better withstand field conditions. These are desirable characteristics, which may evolve over time. However, FDA approval is an absolute requirement. It is expected that unit cost will be competitive with FFP, with a premium commensurate with the beneficial logistic and other aspects of the product. The goal is to develop a product that is commercially viable and not dependent on the US Government purchases. The development approach was to use licensed FFP, with all associated safety measures, including donor screening, testing, quarantine period, and retesting, to produce single-donor lyophilized plasma. It was recognized that pooling would provide more consistent factor levels. However, it was decided to pursue a single-donor approach for safety and traceability purposes. The German Red Cross had recently switched from producing a pooled S/D-lyophilized plasma in favor of a single-donor, lyophilized plasma product, which has since demonstrated a strong safety record with more than 230,000 units used as of 2013 and no reports of poor efficacy. 15 Although lyophilization has been extensively used for producing dried plasma in the past, the development program has been challenging. Lyophilization results in a reduction in activities of some coagulation factors. In general the changes are small. However, an isolated factor reduction of up to 25% has been reported. 15 All previous and current lyophilized plasma products have been produced in a glass bottle.
