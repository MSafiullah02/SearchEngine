STZ has been determined to be the nitrosoamide methylnitrosourea (MNU) linked to the C2 position of d-glucose (Bennett and Pegg 1981). The nitrosamide MNU contributes to its alkylation properties, and glucose moiety directs its selective pancreatic \u03b2-cell uptake via the glucose transporter (GLUT-2) (Elsner et al. 2000). Once STZ enters the \u03b2-cells, it is then cleaved between the 2\u2032-carbon and methyl nitrogen to form carbamoylating and alkylating reactive species (Schnedl et al. 1994; Thulesen et al. 1997; Elsner et al. 2000).",

            "text": "Streptozotocin-induced DM in rats produces all the secondary complications in rodents including DN (Wei et al. 2003). A single dose administration of STZ (40, 50, 55, 60 and 65 mg/kg i.p.) in Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD), Wistar\u2013Kyoto (WKY) or spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats has been shown to induce DN after 4\u20138 weeks, as assessed in terms of serum creatinine (SC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), proteinuria, creatinine clearance (CC), which is often associated with extracellular matrix deposition, dyslipidemia and development of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Casey et al. 2005; Shah and Singh 2006; Gojo et al. 2007; Budhiraja and Singh 2008; Haidara et al. 2009). Following the STZ injection, rats should be given drinking water with glucose to limit early mortality due to hypoglycemia. Generally, 3 days or 1 week after STZ, animal should be screened and those with fasting blood glucose above 240 mg/dL are generally included in the studies of DN (Casey et al. 2005; Gojo et al. 2007). It has been demonstrated that animals showing excessive hyperglycemia are vulnerable to the development of ketonuria and mortality. Thus, in long-term studies of DN, the blood glucose levels are maintained in a desirable range (16\u201333, 300\u2013600 mg/dL) by a daily subcutaneous injection of long-acting insulin (2\u20134 U/rat) (Davis and Alonso 2004). Further, it is generally supposed that STZ may induce pancreatic damage selectively due to specific expression of GLUT-2 in the pancreas. However, it has been observed that STZ causes direct DNA damage and cell proliferation in rat kidney, which last for at least for 3 weeks. Therefore, drug treatment should not be started at least 3 weeks after STZ administration to allow kidneys to recover from the acute and mild nephrotoxic effects of STZ (Kraynak et al. 1995).",

            "text": "The underlying mechanisms of STZ-induced DM is the following: (a) DNA strand breakage in pancreatic islets and consequent activation of nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase, which results in the depletion of intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels; (b) excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2\u2212), hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals (Takasu et al. 1991); (c) STZ being a nitric oxide (NO) donor partially mediates restriction of mitochondrial ATP generation. Further, NO also binds and inhibits the activation of iron-containing aconitase (Welsh et al. 1994); (d) augmented ATP dephosphorylation increases the supply of substrate for xanthine oxidase and enhances the production of uric acid, the final product of ATP degradation (Nukatsuka et al. 1988; Nukatsuka et al. 1990a; Nukatsuka et al. 1990b). The overactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) and increased renal RAAS have been well implicated in the pathogenesis of STZ-induced DN (Brownlee et al. 1988; Chang et al. 2003; Chung and Chung 2003; Asaba et al. 2005; Navaneethan et al. 2005; Tojo et al. 2005) (Fig. 1).\n",

Brugnatelli originally isolated alloxan in 1818 (McLetchie 1982). Alloxan was firstly produced by the oxidation of uric acid by nitric acid (Bailley et al. 1946). Alloxan is considered a strong oxidizing agent in the form of dialuric acid. Dialuric acid, a reduction product of alloxan, has also been shown to be diabetogenic in animals (Bailley et al. 1946; Br\u00fcckmann and Wertheimer 1947) and cause ultrastructural changes similar to those observed in response to alloxan (Szkudelski 2001). This drug can be administered parenterally, i.e., intravenously, intraperitoneally or subcutaneously to exert its diabetogenic action. The induction of insulinopenia due to alloxan causes a state of experimental DM called \u2018alloxan diabetes\u2019 (Dunn and Letchie 1943; Goldner 1945; McLetchie 1982).",

These two effects are due to specific chemical properties of alloxan-like selective cellular uptake and accumulation of alloxan in pancreas. Alloxan is an unstable chemical compound having molecular shape similar to glucose (Weaver et al. 1979; Lenzen and Munday 1991; Gorus et al. 1982). Both alloxan and glucose are hydrophilic and do not penetrate the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. Due to structural similarity of alloxan to glucose molecule, the GLUT2 glucose transporter in the beta cell plasma membrane accepts this glucomimetic and transports it into the cytosol (Weaver et al. 1978; Gorus et al. 1982). Alloxan does not inhibit the function of GLUT2 transporter (Elsner et al. 2002), and therefore selectively enters beta cells in an unrestricted manner (Boquist et al. 1983; Malaisse et al. 2001). It is not toxic to insulin-producing cells that do not express this GLUT2 transporter (Elsner et al. 2002; Bloch et al. 2003).",

The diabetic gene (db) is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, and it has been reported that long intracellular domain form of OB-R is crucial for initiating intracellular signal transduction. As a corollary, the inability to produce this form of OB-R, which leads to the severely obese phenotype found in db/db mice, and weight-reducing effects of leptin being mediated by signal transduction through a leptin receptor in the hypothalamus showed that the db gene encodes for a G-to-T point mutation of the leptin receptor, leading to abnormal splicing and defective signaling of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin (Stephens and Caro 1998). This obese and diabetic mutant (db) was recognized in the C57BLKS/J strain and was subsequently also backcrossed to a pure C57BL/6J background. The C57BLKS/J mouse shares 84 % of its alleles with the common C57BL/6 strain and 16 % with DBA/2 J strain (Naggert et al. 1995). The C57BLKS/J db/db mouse exhibits hyperinsulinemia by 10 days of age, and blood glucose levels are elevated at (7.2 \u00b1 2.3 mM) 1 month of age (Lee and Bressler 1981), while the db/db mouse develops frank hyperglycemia with glucose values of 9.7 \u00b1 1.6 and 15.7 \u00b1 4.3 mM by 8 week and at 10 week of age. Progressive hyperglycemia (28.6 \u00b1 13.2 mM) is noted at 16 weeks of age (Like et al. 1972; Lee and Bressler 1981).",

Further, studies indicate that on the C57BLKS background, type 2 diabetic db/db mice have lesions consistent with DN (thickened basement membrane, mesangial expansion), whereas they are resistant to DN on a C57Bl/6 background. Moreover, these models have not been completely designated; this difference proposed two possibilities: either the worse severity of hyperglycemia that develops in C57BLKS causes this (111) (a combination of peripheral insulin resistance and insulin deficiency develops in C57BLKSLepr db, whereas C57BL/6Lepr db have peripheral insulin resistance) or C57BLKS expresses modifier genes that predispose to DN (Noonan and Banks 2000; Tikellis et al. 2008).",

Estimation of reduced renal mass in kidney of Os/+ ROP mice showed approximately 50 % fewer nephrons in the Os/+ mice than in the +/+mice (Zalups 1993). Further, decreased renal mass was responsible for more glomerulosclerosis in wild-type mice (Os+/+, Ra+/+, and Pt+/+) of ROP background than C57BL/6 mice (Esposito et al. 1999; Cornacchia et al. 2001; Fornoni et al. 2003).
