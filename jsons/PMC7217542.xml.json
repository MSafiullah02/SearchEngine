In ancient times, the spreading of epidemics, such as the black death, could be understood in terms of diffusive processes [1]. In those cases the disease is spread by the agents/hosts that can only travel with bounded velocities between neighboring locations. This gives rise to a wave-front of infected individuals, which travels at a finite speed. The recent great increase of the connectivity among densely populated areas and the correspondent urbanization, has increased the risk that infectious diseases will spread. The complexity of human mobility at all scales, being that urban and inter-urban or world-wide, is reflected in the possibility for the infection to cross arbitrary distances in close to no time. As a consequence, the number of infected sites grows exponentially fast, as opposed to linearly. Similar phenomena are also discussed in a different biological context, see Ref. [12] and references therein.",

The simplest spatial networks are of course lattices. In the context of percolation theory, the so-called effective medium approximation has been developed to describe the diffusion on disordered\u2014i.e., random\u2014lattices [24,25]. The idea is to replace the initially random transport rates between the nodes with fixed deterministic ones. This deterministic average network is called the effective medium, it is characterized by an effective diffusion coefficient. EMA is not a blind average of the transport rates, rather it is determined in a self-consistent manner. Would a link in the effective medium be replaced by its random original, the transport flux along this particular link would not change on average. Hence EMA is particularly suited for systems with independent links. In this paper, we employ EMA for infection spreading in the global human traffic network.",

Crucially, empirical observations show that human mobility lacks a definite scale [10,26] and features long-range connections which have been a major limitation for EMA. Recently [27], we have developed an EMA variant that overcomes this restriction and provides an analytical technique to deal with random spatial networks\u2014a model of tremendous complexity. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that and how EMA can be used in reaction-diffusion systems on random spatial networks with long-range connections.

The metapopulation approach has been successfully used to describe spatially embedded subpopulations, such as cities and urban areas, interacting with each other [33]. Here, we assume diffusive coupling between the subpopulations. The individuals travel in the metapopulation and forget about their original subpopulation at each time step. Thus the model is Markovian on the metapopulation level. Each individual performs a random walk over the subpopulations with jumping probabilities that are given according to a travel rate matrix.",

As the total number of individuals per subpopulation is conserved, the density of susceptible individuals is given by 1\u2212\u03c1x(t). This reveals the first term in Eq.

The Feynman-Kac equation relates the characteristic function of certain integrals of random processes with a partial differential equation and vice versa. The rationale is the same like in the construction of path integrals in quantum mechanics. Although it is hard to solve Eq. (6) explicitly, it is easy to find an upper bound.

Since this is a rather hopeless venture, we will first employ EMA to compute an average transport operator \u03a9~. For details we refer to Ref. [27]. We call the average network described by \u03a9~ the effective medium. The deterministic rates W~x,y of the EMA operator have to be chosen such, that (i) any link that is present in some network of the ensemble will be present in the effective medium, albeit with possibly different strength; and such that (ii) the distance scaling in p(x,y)(w) is preserved. These conditions are necessary for the effective medium to be well defined. The transport rates are determined by the following set of self-consistency equations:\n(15)0=ER~x,y(Wx,y\u2212W~x,y)1+R~x,y(Wx,y\u2212W~x,y).Here, the average is taken over the distribution of one fixed transport rate Wx,y.

(15) describes the average change in the stationary transport flux upon replacement of the effective medium link along (x,y) with its random original Wx,y. EMA requires this change to vanish on average. For this reason it is very successful in reproducing the diffusive properties of the random network ensemble. It is important to note that the actual choice of the effective medium graph is mostly arbitrary, as long as the two conditions given above are respected.",

In our example, the effective medium transport rates are simple averages of the original rates and the EMA result becomes equal to the annealed adjacency matrix approximation of Ref. [21]. This is however a consequence of the high connectivity and the power-law in Eq. (17) and doeas not have to hold in general. For more general topologies or other scaling relations, a different effective medium has to be chosen.

An overview of the agreement with the theoretical bound for the probed range in \u03b1 is shown in Fig. 6. We find that for some of these large values of \u03b1 the numerical data overestimate the EMA bound. This, however, only happens in an intermediate time regime and not in the long time limit, in which we derived Eq. (14). In fact, we find that the upper bound is respected in the long-time limit for all values of \u03b1. The predictions given by EMA are rigorously valid in the thermodynamic limit N\u2192\u221e, when the infection propagates indefinitely and saturation is never reached.\n",

We wanted to advocate the use of effective medium theory that provides a deterministic representative for an originally random network. Together with the standard Feynman-Kac argument we provide an upper bound for the infection spread in a simple SIS model that is well respected in the long time limit of our numerical simulations. We also demonstrated that certain parameters, like the L\u00e9vy exponent \u03b1, can be extracted from data, thus verifying that a made assumption on the random network's ensemble is correct. This way we demonstrated that EMA is still relevant even beyond the short-range connection paradigm.",

(17). Other characteristics of the transition rates (like their mean) only play a minor role in the dynamics. Notice, that long-range links with a \u201cweak\u201d power law\u2014i.e., \u03b1>2 in Eq. (17)\u2014would eventually lead to a ballistic growth of the infection front.

Internal dynamics on the nodes (like commuting agents) could be considered by replacing the subpopulations by small networks themselves.
