Since August 2014, an increase in Enterovirus(EV)-D68 infections was reported. We aimed to investigate epidemiology and clinical relevance of EV-D68. From June to December 2014 and from September to December 2015, 803 and 847 respiratory specimens, respectively, were tested for respiratory viruses with a multiplex RT-PCR. This multiplex RT-PCR does not detect EV-D68. Therefore, 457 (2014) and 343 (2015) specimens with negative results were submitted to an EV-specific-RT-PCR. EV-positive specimens were tested with an EV-D68-specific-RT-PCR and genotyped.",

All EV-D68-positive patients were admitted to hospital, 4 (57%) were admitted to intensive care units and 6 (86%) received oxygen. One patient suffered from acute flaccid paralysis. Seven specimens of 2015 were positive in the EV-specific-RT-PCR but negative in the EV-D68-specific-RT-PCR.

Importantly, EV-D68 is not detected by all diagnostic assays for the detection of EV or respiratory viruses with good sensitivity or might be misidentified as HRV. 2 Circulation of EV-D68 has been reported since 1962 and has been associated with sporadic cases of respiratory disease and small outbreaks. 3 Since August 2014, an increase in infections caused by EV-D68 has been reported in the USA, Canada, and in Europe.

In the cases of acute neurological illnesses described recently only one case had EV-D68 detected in blood, whereas EV-D68 was typically detected in respiratory specimens. Nevertheless, the authors concluded on a possible causal association of EV-D68 with myelitis. [14] [15] [16] [17] Therefore, the findings in our case do not contradict the association of EV-D68 with myelitis. However, taking into account the weakly positive EBV PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid, the myelitis might also be due to EBV infection. In conclusion, the use of an EV-specific-RT-PCR allowed us to detect the circulation of EV-D68 in Northern France in autumn 2014 that had not been detected by the commercial multiplex RT-PCR. Although few EV-D68 cases were detected, the diagnosis of EV-D68 was of clinical relevance because EV-D68 was associated with severe disease.",
