Comparing CoViD-19 trends over time and place may thus provide important public health insights about the impact of different strategies. To aid these comparisons, we illustrate the properties of 3 comparative indicators of CoViD-19 mortality using estimates and projections for the world's most affected areas. We first demonstrate how a Crude CoViD-19 Death Rate (CCDR) incorporates the temporal dimension of CoViD-19 mortality. We also show how the advantage of the indirectly age-standardized Comparative CoViD-19 Mortality Ratio (CCMR). Finally, we calculate declines in life expectancy at birth that translate CoViD-19 mortality projections into an easily interpretable metric. Projections used to illustrate this yields a .3 of a year decline in life expectancy at birth for the U.S.A., for instance, which would be comparable to the decline in life expectancy at birth between 1992 and 1993 (AIDS mortality) and between 2014 and 2017 (opioid-overdose mortality). Data about the pandemic are changing too rapidly to draw any conclusion from the current values of the indicators, however, and there are multiple reasons to expect upward revisions of these projections.",

The CCSE numbers illustrate a public health emergency developing at a very fast pace. In response, national and local institutions have issued public-health orders to slow the spread of the disease and \"flatten the curve\" so that the number of infected individuals in need of intensive care peaks at a level lower than local hospital capacity. Comparing CoViD-19 trends over time and place may thus provide important public health insights about the strategies that have succeeded in reducing the need for emergency hospitalizations and, eventually, the CoViD-19 death toll. The number of reported cases seems to represent only a small, varying fraction of the actual number of cases, 2 depending in particular on variable testing capacities. Deaths attributed to CoViD-19 provide a more reliable basis for comparative assessments. While their number is also likely under-reported at the moment, 3 the death undercount due to delays in registering deaths at home and in nursing homes is of a much smaller magnitude than the case undercount and can be expected to decline further over time.",

Dividing the number of CoVid-19 deaths by the population size, a comparative table on the CSSE website displays vastly different ratios: from .33 deaths per 100,000 people in China, to 16.43 in the United States and to 43.66 in Italy. 1 Considering the countries with at least 1,000 deaths, the largest ratio appears to be in Belgium, with 6,917 deaths but a ratio of 60.56 deaths per 100,000 people.",

First, it does not integrate the time dimension, that is, it does not differentiate between a number of deaths recorded in periods of different duration. In particular, while the ratio may appear small in comparison to the Crude Death Rate (CDR, in the order of 850 deaths per person-year in the U.S.A.), the CDR includes deaths for one year whereas most of the CoViD-19 deaths registered to date occurred in the last 2 months. Second, the ratio does not control for the age distribution of the population, whereas strong variations in CoViD-19 mortality by age are already well established. Finally, national-level indicators mask important within-country differences. In China, the vast majority of deaths originated in one Province (Hubei), with a population size roughly equivalent to the national population of Italy. In the U.S.A., the epidemic might be better studied as several epidemics of variable timing and intensity than as one national epidemic. With about 6% of the U.S. population, the State of New York State has close to half of the estimated CoViD-19 deaths in the country.",

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has begun to publish weekly such a breakdown for CoViD-19 deaths in the U.S.A., albeit on a relatively small number of registered death. 5 This allows for the calculation of a CMR-equivalent measure for CoViD-19 mortality in all areas for which the population can be estimated for the same age groups as in the CDC data.",

Hubei Province and these 14 countries jointly accounted for 85% of the global CoViD-19 deaths reported on the CSSE dashboard at the time. We also calculate projected year-to-date CCDR values for 11 of the 14 Countries (9 European Countries, Canada, the U.S.A.) for which IHME projections were available and for the U.S. States.

We first point out a few additional insights from calculating the CCDR at the level of a Province (China) or State (U.S.A.) rather than merely at the Country level. For instance, whereas the ratio of estimated number of CoViD-19 deaths/population size in China is far smaller than in most other countries, the value of the current year-to-date CCDR for Hubei Province is higher than in 5 of the 14 countries considered here: Brazil, Turkey, Canada, Germany and Iran. The CCDR values for U.S. States also confirm stark differences in their CoViD-19 mortality so far, with the value in the State of New York nearly twice as high as the second-highest value for a U.S. State (New Jersey) or the highest value for a Country (Belgium). With a combined population size of 52.3 million, thus comparable to the size of a large European Country, the 5 Northeastern U.S. States (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York & Pennsylvania) also exhibit a higher year-to-date CCDR than any European Country. Finally, the year-to-date CCDR value is currently higher in the combined population of the first 9 U.S. States to reach 1,000 CoViD-19 deaths than in the combined population of the first 9 European Countries to reach that grim milestone.",

The CCDR thus provides a better picture of the temporal distribution of deaths. At this time, the IHME projections yield higher CCDR values for the period ending on August 4, 2020 than the current CSSE estimates in 2 of the 14 countries (the Netherlands and Sweden) and 3 of the 9 U.S. States (Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania) included herein.",

An agestandardized indicator as well, the decline in life expectancy at birth translates CoViD-19 mortality projections into an easily interpretable metric.

Based on a single set of estimates and projections, this first set of results fails to express the uncertainty surrounding future projections and even current estimates. We plan to attend to this uncertainty in future updates, especially as regards projections. To take a single example, the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM) used by researchers at Northeastern University projects between 60,000 and 121,000 CoViD-19 deaths in the U.S.A. by May 12, 2020 under the \"mitigated\" scenario with stay-at-home policy. 9 Other models suggest even higher numbers for the same period, whereas the IHME projects 68,000 deaths by August 4, 2020 . Moreover, at the moment none of these models can predict the likelihood of a second wave of infections later in the year. Finally, the eventual decline in life expectancy will depend on the \"downstream\" effects of the pandemic and mitigating policies, which may affect mortality from other causes. While mortality rates from some causes may well decline (e.g., motor-vehicle injuries), mortality rates from other causes are likely to increase, especially in places where hospitals' intensive-care capacities became saturated by the surge in CoViD-19 emergency hospitalizations.",
