Wave after wave of acutely ill patients come in, and we bear witness to human loss and tragedy on an unprecedented scale. There is an implicit assumption that, as emergency clinicians, we would be calm and unflappable on the frontlines to meet any disaster, no matter how grave. It feels entirely different when I see healthy adults my own age bringing in their gravely ill parents who then come back themselves in respiratory arrest mere days later. We struggle over which patient to intubate because we are faced with rationing of limited ventilators. We reuse face masks that are meant to be disposable because our hospitals may run out of them next week. How can we survive in this \"whole of society\" crisis? I used to say that I could escape work once I left the hospital, but the disease and its impact follows me everywhere I go. The desolate streets and empty restaurants and my inability to see loved ones amplify my helplessness against this relentless invisible threat. Over the last two weeks, I have admitted three of my friends and fellow emergency clinicians, all relatively young and healthy, into our own hospital. We were just at a potluck three months ago, and now I was at the bedside resuscitating one of my friends. Could I have ever thought that one day I would be intubating my friend? And who is to say I won't be next?\" -Emergency Physician, New York, NY, April 2020",

            "text": "The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency in January 2020. 1 In March, the organization further characterized the outbreak as a pandemic with rising infection rates around the world and within the United States. 2 In addition to the physical mortality and morbidity directly attributed to COVID-19, this pandemic has broad psychosocial and emotional impact. 3, 4 Advancements in global connectedness, digital technology, and media coverage has amplified both the spread of the COVID-19 infection and the intensity of associated psychological fear. 5 As frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in prehospital and emergency department (ED) settings, we are particularly vulnerable to negative mental health effects from COVID-19. [6] [7] [8] Our clinical environments face relentless increases in patient volume and acuity, while we experience unprecedented physical and psychological hardship. In addition, conflicting and rapidly changing information regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) fuel our ongoing fears of exposure and uncertainty regarding our own safety in the workplace. 9, 10 We are asked to comply with novel practices to conserve or reuse PPE, 11, 12 which are not part of the routine practice of our specialty, without any explicit consent. Allowing such expectations to be promulgated without any discussion is not only dubious ethically, but could be a major impediment to the care for future patients as providers become sick or die as a result of ignoring these violations. . While many of us accept the increased risk of infection as part of our chosen profession, some may have concerns about family transmission or feel pressure to comply due to fear of losing their job, desire to be team players, and altruistic goals of caring for those in need. 13 As a result of these issues, the COVID-19 crisis has shaken even the most battle-hardened of our ranks. The unique paradox of simultaneous global digital interconnectedness and social and physical isolation that marks this epidemic has shifted our normal systems of coping. Across the world, we as frontline HCWs are being challenged both to grapple individually with our emotions, and to work collectively to support resilience among our colleagues during this historic event.",

            "text": "To help guide us, we can draw on lessons learned in prior pandemics and disasters regarding HCW mental health. 14 Many of us across the country have already moved through the phase of \"anticipatory traumatic reactions,\" a future-focused form of distress and grief that has been documented for frontline caregivers in prior pandemics. 15 These reactions reflect a sense of fearful waiting, or even terror, about what the future may hold for us while an unfamiliar and uncomfortable quiet fills the halls. 16 Acute stress disorder and associated symptoms will also likely be common; up to 20% of HCWs had stress-related disorders immediately following the SARS epidemic and 9/11. 17,18 These acute psychological symptoms may lead to the development of long term mental health problems amongst a particularly vulnerable populations of HCWs, including those of us directly involved with diagnosing, treating, or caring for the critically ill. 6 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) -characterized by greater than one month of intense intrusive or re-experiencing thoughts (e.g., nightmares or flashbacks), avoidance of trauma-related reminders, alteration of mood and cognition (e.g., self-blame, negative views about oneself or the world), and heightened sense of threat 19 -is the most common long-term consequence of disaster exposure among HCWs and first responders. 20, 21 We know that our risk for PTSD will increase with factors that are inherent to COVID-19, such as the intensity of exposure, the perception of danger, and the perception that the experience is unexpected or uncontrollable. 22 We also know that high rates of PTSD after disasters reflects our repeated direct and indirect traumatic stress during patient care. 23, 24 Prior research suggests that exposure to a disaster situation may also have positive psychological impacts for some of us. Improved adaptability to stressful stimuli and post-traumatic growth (positive emotional and psychological changes in response to trauma) have been reported after major crises. 25 Factors associated with these positive responses among HCWs included adequate preparedness (e.g., training and crisis preparation), greater social support (particularly familial and collegial support), and adaptive coping behaviors that involve acceptance rather than avoidance (e.g., asserting charge of the situation and viewing obstacles as positive challenges). 26 We wish to emphasize, however, that although the COVID-19 pandemic shares similarities with prior disasters and epidemics, it also has unique stressors. As HCWs on the frontlines of COVID-19 response, we in emergency medicine struggle with a uniquely high risk of asymptomatic transmission, 27 significant knowledge gaps about the viral pathophysiology, 28 and an unprecedented local and federal breakdown in supplies of personal protective equipment. 11 In regions of the country with the highest rates of infection and severe shortages in resources, we are exposed to difficult and often unprecedented decisions about rationing of care, 29-31 causing a sense of moral injury that often leads to clinician burnout. 32 Social distancing and other unique aspects of this pandemic further remove us from our normal coping mechanisms, leading to a perfect storm of psychosocial stress. Many of us are experiencing financial strain from paradoxical reductions in income at the moment of highest risk, due to overall decreases in ED volume. Finally, COVID-19 is the first pandemic to occur in an age of deep digital integration, exposing us to constant streams of unfiltered clinical information and reinforcing sentiments of angst and despair. 33 Each of these elements potentially amplifies our anxiety, hopelessness, and fear, and as well as our long-term risk of mental health consequences. 6, 34 Already, Chinese HCWs involved in the COVID-19 response have reported high rates of distress (70%), depression (50%), anxiety (45%), and insomnia (34%); the highest risk factor for distress was being a frontline or emergency care HCW. 6 These rates of HCW distress are surpassing those reported after Ebola, SARS, and other prior pandemics. 35, 36 What can we do?",

Some mobile applications may provide support in a more informal manner. While further evidence is still necessary, we highlight the government-developed PTSD Coach (https://mobile.va.gov/app/ptsd-coach), a program based on CBT principles that has evidence from a randomized controlled study. 43, 44 This application offers PTSD symptom tracking and skills to cope with common distress reactions such as anger, anxiety, hopelessness, and sleep problems, and may be helpful to some of our distressed colleagues. Others may also wish to consider resources such as telepsychiatry, which is feasible and effective for a range of mental health diseases ranging from depression to anxiety. 45 Training in mindfulness can easily be found online, and apps such as Headspace are now free to all American healthcare providers with a National Provider Identification number.",

It provides a hierarchical context for how individuals prioritize their needs, starting from the most fundamental (physiological and safety), and progressing to more abstract and complex needs once more basic ones are met (love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization). Many clinicians are finding solutions through a purposeful focus on positive and adaptive behaviors that address each of our needs in Maslow's hierarchy. Taking walks outdoors as the weather becomes warmer, maintaining sleep and exercise schedules, and re-connecting with friends and family can help our bodies feel whole. These simple actions also help us overcome feelings of social isolation, restlessness, and loneliness. As more basic needs are adequately met, we may be able to channel some of our frustrations with the pandemic into constructive efforts to combat the outbreak. For example, some of our colleagues are synthesizing up-to-date knowledge about disease management or creating innovative solutions for equipment and clinical workflow.",

We encourage our leaders to develop strategies that can serve as a foundation for us to improve needs higher in Maslow's hierarchy. For example, careful attention to HCWs' work schedules will not only address physiological needs, but will also allow for sufficient rest, thereby strengthening our meaningful work, our esteem, and our sense of self-actualization.
