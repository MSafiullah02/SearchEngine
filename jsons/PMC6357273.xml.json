However, the mechanism underlying hypertension, especially essential hypertension, is still unknown [1]. Although there are several ways to return blood pressure (BP) to normal, such as antihypertensive drugs and life-style improvements, the main complications of hypertension, such as stroke and heart failure, are harmful to health [2]. It is of vital clinical importance to understand the mechanism of essential hypertension. Sympathetic nerve overactivation, the main cause of essential hypertension, has a close relationship with the death rates from cardiovascular accidents [3]. So clarifying the mechanism of sympathetic nerve overactivation is important for the prevention of hypertension.",

Acetylcholine (ACh), an important excitatory neurotransmitter, is also involved in the mechanism of sympathetic outflow overactivation [8]. Previous studies have shown that a cholinergic mechanism is involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system by the RVLM [9\u201311]. It has been reported that the pressor response evoked by activation of M2 muscarinic receptors in the RVLM is greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) than in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats [12]. Furthermore, ACh release and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity in the RVLM are both enhanced in SHRs [13]. These findings suggest that cholinergic transmission in the RVLM is enhanced under hypertension, and this may contribute to the maintenance of a high BP and high levels of sympathetic tone.",

As an important component of the RAS, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) catalyzes the formation of Ang-(1\u20137) and other related peptides in the peripheral system [14]. Further discoveries of ACE2 in both the peripheral and central cardiovascular systems have shown that it provides a long-term beneficial outcome to the cardiovascular system and is considered to be a novel therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension [14, 15]. It has been demonstrated that ACE2 is widely expressed in cardiovascular regulatory regions [16, 17]. Furthermore, it has been reported that ACE2 expression and activity in the RVLM are decreased in SHRs, while ACE2 overexpression in the RVLM improves the cardiovascular dysfunction under hypertension [18].

Supernatants were collected and used to measure the concentration of ACh following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The concentration of choline was assessed via a coupled enzymatic reaction, which produced a colorimetric (570 nm)/fluorometric product (lex = 535/lem = 587 nm), proportional to the choline present. ACh levels were determined by acetylcholinesterase, which hydrolyzes ACh to choline and acetate.",

Excitation of these C1 neurons by local microinjection of the excitatory amino-acid L-glutamate can induce a pressor response, while inhibition of C1 neurons via microinjection of the inhibitory amino-acid \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can lead to a fall of arterial pressure [33]. It is known that C1 neurons in the RVLM are the key factor in generating sympathetic outflow and maintaining BP [34]. It has been reported that neurons which contain ChAT, the key enzyme for ACh synthesis, are distributed throughout the C1 area and make direct synaptic contacts with C1 neurons [35]. It has also been shown that blocking cholinergic transmission in the RVLM can reduce the arterial pressure and this suggests that cholinergic transmission contributes to the regulation of cardiovascular activity.",

Previous studies have shown that cholinergic transmission in the RVLM is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension [36]. We assessed the ACh content using dialysate, which showed that the release of ACh was enhanced in SHRs. As to the source of the ACh release in the RVLM, a previous study showed that there are two sources [37]. One is the neurons in the RVLM that contain ChAT, and the other is the terminals of cholinergic neurons that project to the RVLM from other nuclei. We also determined the protein expression of VAChT and found it was significantly higher in SHRs than in WKY rats. Enhanced expression of VAChT may be responsible for the increased ACh release in the RVLM. The cholinergic neurons in other important nuclei with axon terminals projecting into the RVLM may also affect the enhanced ACh release in the RVLM. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), another critical nucleus responsible for the regulation of water intake, urinary volume, and cardiovascular activity, controls sympathetic outflow via projections to the RVLM [38]. Furthermore, studies have shown that the neurons in the PVN that project to the RVLM include cholinergic neurons [39]. However, it was a limitation of our study that we did not examine the synthesis state of ACh in the PVN and this needs to be clarified in future.",

It has been reported that the pressor response to microinjection of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor into the RVLM is greater in SHRs than in WKY rats [19, 40]. We also found that the depressor response to blocking muscarinic receptors was significantly higher in SHRs than in WKY rats, which also confirmed that basal cholinergic transmission is enhanced under hypertension. As to the receptor that mediates the effect of ACh, there are two types, ionotropic (nicotinic, nAChRs) and metabotropic (muscarinic, mAChRs) [41]. Studies have suggested that cholinergic neurons in the RVLM contain both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors [42]. In previous studies, it was reported that microinjection of an mAChR antagonist into the RVLM area elicits a decrease in basal BP, while an antagonist of nAChRs has no effect on BP [43]. This suggests that the cholinergic transmission mediating basal BP works through acting on mAChRs. However, studies have also shown that the pathological change of cholinergic transmission is mainly in the presynaptic mechanisms (the synthesis, transport, and release of ACh), while the protein expression of mAChRs is unchanged under hypertension [44]. So we focused on the presynaptic mechanisms involved in cholinergic transmission in the RVLM. Whether improvement of the presynaptic transmission of ACh can contribute to a reduction of sympathetic outflow stimulated our interest.",

Since ACh is released in a Ca2+-dependent manner, the mechanism involved in decreasing the release of ACh in the RVLM may be mediated by NO via reducing Ca2+ influx [50]. Our previous work has demonstrated that exogenous injection of Ang 1\u20137 into the NTS produces a significant increase in NO release, which is mediated by the PI3K-Akt-NOS signaling pathway [51]. Other studies have also indicated that ACE2 overexpression enhances the activity and increases the concentration of NO in the brain [52, 53]. So the mechanism involved in ACE2 overexpression depressing the enhanced cholinergic transmission may be associated with the NOS-NO-adenosine pathway. This is a limitation of the present study and needs to be defined in future. On the other hand, ACh also has a complex relationship with another important neurotransmitter, GABA, which plays a key role in inhibitory projections to the RVLM. Previous studies have shown that the release of GABA and the expression of GABA receptors are down-regulated under hypertension [54]. ACE2 overexpression facilitates GABA release and enhances inhibitory transmission in the RVLM [55]. However, GABA can cause a decrease in ACh release [56, 57]. So the GABA mechanism may also be involved in the improvement of cholinergic transmission mediated by ACE2 overexpression.",

As the key transporter for assembling ACh vesicles, the decreased expression of VAChT made some contribution to the reduced ACh release. However, we did not examine the expression of ChAT, the key enzyme for ACh synthesis. It is interesting that a previous study showed that the gene encoding VAChT is localized within the first intron of the gene encoding ChAT and is in the same transcriptional orientation. This means that these two proteins might be under the same regulation. Studies have also shown that several classes of factors, such as leukemia inhibitory factor and retinoic acid, can induce ChAT activity and increase the levels of multiple ChAT mRNA species in these neurons [58]. So whether ACE2 has any effect on the transcriptional regulation of VAChT and ChAT is still unclear and needs further investigation.",

The data showed no difference in protein expression of mAChRs after ACE2 overexpression. However, we did not overlook the other type of cholinergic receptor, nAChRs, which are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels present on skeletal muscle cells, neurons, and a number of non-neuronal cells throughout the body, such as lymphocytes and epithelial cells [59]. Studies have referred to the protective effect of nAChRs in neurons by showing that they mediate an anti-inflammatory effect which leads to a decrease in the level of oxidative stress [60\u201362]. It is known that the state of oxidation is higher in the RVLM under hypertension. Our previous work also determined that ACE2 overexpression decreases the level of neuroinflammation in the RVLM [22]. So whether the nAChRs involved in the neuroprotective effect of ACE2 overexpression is still unknown and needs further study.",
