SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory infection with varying severity in different age groups, wherein elderly tend to have severe disease, children are relatively spared till-date [3]. Several differences in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 between children and adults have been proposed to explain these differences [4].",

It is equally important to identify high-risk groups in children, so that recommendations regarding therapeutics and when available, vaccines can be made. Hence, the authors conducted a narrative review focussing on the clinical manifestations, disease pathogenesis, and possible factors explaining differences between adult and pediatric infection. As COVID-19 has similarities to SARS, some findings from SARS CoV-1 pathogenesis are extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The possibility of a change in spectrum of pediatric disease, as the pandemic evolves further, should also be kept in mind.",

There were 3 deaths (0.1%) in children compared to overall 2.27% mortality [6]. Ages of these 3 children were not reported, but one case reported from Illinois was an infant [10]. The Chinese case-series of 171 laboratory-confirmed children also reported one death in a 10-mo-old child, who suffered intussusception and multi-organ failure [7]. In a Chinese series of 728 laboratory-confirmed children, the proportion of \u2018severe and critical\u2019 cases was 8.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, 1.1% and 5.1% for the age-groups of \u02c21, 1\u20135, 6\u201310, 11\u201315 and > 15 y, respectively [11].

However, the estimated case fatality rate (CFR) in under-5s was approximately half of that in adults >70 y. On the other hand, incidence of influenza is nearly 60% more in adults >70 y [15.8 (11.8\u201320.2)] as compared to under-5s [9.1 (5.4\u201314.8)]. Here also, the estimated CFR in adults >70 y is more than double of that in under-5s [12]. Other studies on RSV burden also estimate a lower incidence of RSV ALRI in adults >65 y as compared to under-5s and a multiple-fold higher hospital CFR in adults >65 y [13, 14].",

One possible explanation is that the latter were associated with high CFR and started as outbreaks, which led to strict quarantine procedures and closing of potential hotspots for pediatric infections like schools and day-care centers. As movement of children is highly limited in these times, most of the infections are spread from infected adult family members. Even within families, individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection are isolated, which may reduce exposure of children. Among studies of household contacts, odds of infection in children were significantly less than elderly (OR: 0.26, 95%CI 0.13\u20130.54) and gradually increased with age [23, 24].",

SARS-CoV-2 titres in nasopharyngeal and endotracheal aspirate specimens are high during first week of symptoms followed by gradual decline starting at end of first week [32\u201335]. In nasopharyngeal swabs from 76 patients, viral loads were significantly higher in severely affected (approximately 60 times) than mildly affected patients [36]. Another study found that patients with severe illness had approximately 1 log10 higher viral titres (not statistically significant) [33]. A small series found no difference in viral loads between mild and severe disease. But the authors analyzed plasma RNAaemia and included only 2 and 4 patients with RNAaemia in severe and mild illness, respectively [37]. After approximately 4\u20137 d, a proportion of patients enter critical phase which is associated with progressive decline in viral titres and worsening of inflammatory markers. Patients with more severe disease have less steep and prolonged decline in viral titres [33]. Levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 are higher in critically ill patients than patients with mild disease [37, 38]. Number of T-cells, helper T-cells, and memory helper T-cells are decreased and na\u00efve helper T-cells is increased in severe group compared to mild group [39]. Increase in IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 antigens [internal nucleoprotein (NP) and receptor binding protein (RBP)] was seen around day 7\u201310 of symptoms, followed by gradual decrease in viral load [33, 34]. The persistent high virus titres, poorly controlled by dysfunctional immune system with elevated cytokine levels, point towards combined effect of virus mediated cytopathic effects and immune-mediated injury as the pathway of severe lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction during critical phase. Patients can succumb to illness during critical phase or gradually recover.",

            "text": "ACE-2 is a counter-regulatory enzyme of renin-angiotensin-system which acts by converting angiotensin-2 to Ang-(1\u20137) form. In healthy state, ACE-2 activity maintains homeostasis between angiotensin-2 (vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation) and Ang-(1\u20137) pathways (vasodilatation, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrosis, and anti-proliferation) [45]. After entering pneumocytes, SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE-2 expression, decreasing angiotensin-2 metabolism. Elevated angiotensin-2 increases pulmonary vascular permeability and inflammation, hence worsening of lung injury [21, 46]. Angiotensin-2 levels have been found to be increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy adults [32]. Angiotensin-2 levels have significant positive correlation with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and lung injury severity, probably via ACE-2 down-regulation [32]. Elevated angiotensin-2 levels have also been seen with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and avian influenza pneumonia [47, 48]. ACE-2 levels decrease in old age and co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes, possibly explaining worse lung injury and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 in them [45, 49]. In a phase-2 clinical trial of recombinant ACE-2 infusion in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there was significant decrease in angiotensin-2 levels, and increase in Ang-(1\u20137) and surfactant protein-4 levels [50]. High levels of ACE-2 activity in children could be protective in children with COVID-19, leading to less severe disease in this age group compared to elderly.",

Cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10, and blood neutrophil counts are significantly elevated in severely ill patients, representing dysfunctional and exaggerated innate response causing lung injury [38].

In a study from Latin America of children from age groups 6\u20139, 22\u201326, and 48\u201360 mo, younger children had higher release of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha to toll like-receptor (TLR) stimulation i.e., more robust innate response. The percentage of CD4+ na\u00efve T-cells decreased while memory T cells increased with age [69]. An inadequate adaptive response could explain worse course of illness seen in COVID-19 affected young infants compared to older children. Also, maternal antibodies protecting neonates and young infants, are unlikely to act against novel viruses like SARS-CoV-2 [70].",

RSV infection in aged cotton rats showed prolonged viral replication and delayed rise in cytokine levels compared to younger rats [71]. Multiple innate immunity aberrations have been reported in elderly: reduced dendritic cell number and function, decreased TLR induction, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased macrophage and neutrophil function, reduced NK-cell activity, decreased \u03b3\u03b4 T cell proliferation and number [72, 73]. These factors lead to excessively pro-inflammatory response to infections; as well as delay in or lack of switch from an innate immune response to an adaptive immune response [21]. In patients with SARS, the survivors had a gene expression profile indicative of development of an adaptive immune response while deceased showed persistently elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines encoded by the interferon-stimulated genes [74].",
