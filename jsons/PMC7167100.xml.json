The questionnaire was developed based on the instrument used in the 2011 school preparedness study,4 though it was greatly expanded to provide a more comprehensive analysis of school readiness. The original questionnaire consisted of 17 school biological event preparedness indicators. We added 18 new items by incorporating standards outlined in recent Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)8 and US Department of Agriculture (USDA)9 planning documents. Most additions focused on school culture and policies related to infectious disease management, food biosecurity plans, and the incorporation of psychological needs into the school plan. The instrument included 15 questions related to all\u2010hazards school disaster preparedness and 35 measured biological event preparedness (13 of the disaster preparedness indicators plus 22 unique to infectious diseases). Twenty\u2010nine of the 35 biological event preparedness indicators were dichotomous and scored either 0 or 1 point, depending on whether the school met the criteria or not. Examples include having a written policy that encourages students to stay home when ill, having a designated sick room without pass through, and having a plan that addressed biological events (all scored as \u201cyes\u201d = 1 point; \u201cno\u201d = 0). Six of the 35 biological event preparedness indicators could be partially met and were assigned 1, 0.5, or 0 points, depending on the extent to which the school met the criteria. One example was the indicator \u201crespiratory hygiene training for staff,\u201d which could be completely met (all staff trained: 1 point), partially met (some staff trained: 0.5 point), or not met at all (no staff trained: 0 points). Table 1 outlines the preparedness indicators and how each was measured or scored. Psychometric testing conducted on the instrument has been described previously in research utilizing the questionnaire.4\n",

Although the intervention was not consistent across participants in terms of the number of modules watched, the data analysis process assessed dose response (ie, impact from watching more modules) and none was found. Although the overall response rate was similar to other online surveys,21 few nurses completed both a pre\u2010 and postintervention survey, resulting in a small sample size for assessing the impact of the intervention. This may have made it more difficult to detect a significant change resulting in a lower than actual impact from the intervention, or conversely, it may mean that only those nurses who were most interested in disaster preparedness took the time to participate in both surveys resulting in an outcome biased toward higher improvement.
