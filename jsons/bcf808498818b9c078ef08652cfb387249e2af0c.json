First developed in the 1940s as an intermittent positive pressure breathing device for use in highaltitude aviation, NIVs were subsequently used by Motley and colleagues at Bellevue Hospital to treat acute respiratory failure in patients with pneumonia, pulmonary edema, near-drowning, acute severe asthma, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. 1 The application of NIV in clinical settings became widespred in the 1980s. In 1989, Meduri and colleagues successfully applied NIV via full-face mask in patients with respiratory insufficiency and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, or pneumonia. 2 Thereafter, NIV has become increasingly adopted by critical care clinicians for the treatment of acute respiratory failure in both emergency and critical care settings. 3 The medical conditions for which critical care clinicians have recognized the importance of NIV have also rapidly increased during this period. 4 When appropriately indicated and promptly administered, NIV offers an alternative to tracheal intubation, sedation, risk of infection, and myriad complications associated with invasive ventilation, and it can promote rapid respiratory recovery, and reduce a patient's dependence on critical care facilities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 628, "end": 629, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 913, "end": 914, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1085, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1231, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In addition to strongly proved benefits in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of COPD and pulmonary edema resulting from heart failure, 5 NIV has become a useful therapeutic option for respiratory failure in patients who are immunosupressed 6 and in patients with chest trauma. 7 Successful use of NIV has also been seen in patients with chronic respiratory failure due to neurological and neuromuscular diseases such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and muscular dystrophies 8 and during the respirator-weaning process. 9 In contrast, the utility of NIV in hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumonia is still doubtful. 10 In spite of very well-known indications, the use of NIV in clinical practice is far from uniform.

The rate of use of NIV differed from 0 to more than 50% of ventilator starts within the same region.

Patients in whom NIV was successful had shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates, similar to those of the nonventilated patients. The mortality of patients in whom NIV failed was similar to that of the patients requiring intubation from the start. 18 Another critical preparedness task was to ensure a safe hospital environment for other patients and for health care workers (HCWs) during an epidemic.

During the 2003 epidemic, about 75% of SARS infections in Hong Kong and Singapore were associated with SSEs, confronting epidemiologists and clinicians with the task of identifying the hospital procedures contributing to this phenomenon and modifying their infection control measures. 21 Yu et al analyzed the factors responsible for hospital spreading of SARS infection and found 6 significant risk factors: minimum distance between beds (\u22641 m), the availability of washing or changing facilities for staff, administering resuscitation in the ward, staff members working while experiencing symptoms, and whether the host patient (index patients or the first patient admitted to a ward) required oxygen therapy or bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. 22 The experience in Singapore, however, demonstrated that following the development of proper infection control measures, which consisted of staff personal protection, patient risk categorization, and reorganization of operating room workflow process, no transmission of SARS had occurred within the operating room complex. 23 Moreover, it was well known that NIV is not the only procedure that carries an increased risk of transmitting acute respiratory infection pathogens to staff. In their systematic review of literature concerning aerosol-generating procedures and the risk of transmitting acute respiratory infection to HCWs, Tran and coworkers found that tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, and manual ventilation before intubation were procedures with significantly increased risk of transmission-as much as with NIV. Furthermore, they found that tracheal intubation was the procedure most consistently associated with the transmission of SARS virus to HCWs. 24 Several reports on the 2003 SARS epidemic reported good clinical results with NIV use, which was also associated with reduced intubation rate and mortality. 19, 25, 26 Zhao et al compared 4 treatment modalities for hospitalized SARS patients and reported that the best clinical improvement was achieved in patients who received early high-dose steroids combined with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. 26 Importantly, in a retrospective analysis comparing the efficacy of NIV against invasive ventilation in SARS patients with respiratory failure, Yam et al reported that no HCW caring for NIV patients was infected and that standard personal protective equipment, including surgical masks, was as effective as the more sophisticated protective equipment used later in the outbreak. 24 Cheung et al reported the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in 20 patients with acute respiratory failure due to SARS. Their results showed that in patients with NIPPV, tracheal intubation was avoided in 14 cases.

This document highlighted concerns associated with the potential increased risk of generating infectious aerosols in the course of this method of respiratory support. 27 Research using experimental lung models demonstrated that exposure to exhaled air from patients receiving NIV with face mask occurs within 1 m. 28 Likewise, guidelines for the acquisition of ventilators to meet the demands for pandemic flu and mass casualty incidents, published in 2006 by the American Association of Respiratory Care, recommended the avoidance of NIV in case of contagious respiratory diseases due to contamination risk. 29 The Task Force on Mass Critical Care voiced similar opinions regarding noninvasive ventilation during their summit meeting in January 2007. Their suggestions regarding interventions for emergency mass critical care and the use of mechanical ventilation during a disaster recommended only the \"provision of a basic mode of sustained, positive pressure ventilation\" without any reference to NIV. 30 The task force further declared NIV a high-risk procedure due to the potential for air flow from the mask to increase the risk of infectious transmission to the staff and to other patients. 27, 29 Since 2009, however, some published documents have mentioned NIV as a possible procedure during an epidemic. In a position statement, the Australian Society for Infectious Diseases recommends \"reserving negative-pressure ventilation rooms (if available) for intensive care patients, especially those receiving non-invasive ventilation.\" 31 The UK Department of Health, in \"Guidance for infection control in critical care for pandemic influenza,\" approved the use of NIV under strict infection control measures.
