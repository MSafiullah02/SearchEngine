            "text": "ECMO is increasingly being used for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly in cases of severe ARDS in which life-threatening hypoxemia or hypercapnia persists despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilatory support [1, 2]. In addition, ECMO is used in some patients in whom life-threatening gas exchange abnormalities are sufficiently improved with the use of positive-pressure ventilation, but only at the expense of generating excessively high inspiratory airway pressures. ECMO in this setting facilitates lung-protective ventilation and minimizes ventilator-associated lung injury. Despite the increasing use of ECMO in ARDS, high-level evidence supporting its benefit for this indication is lacking. The first successful use of ECMO for severe post-traumatic hypoxemic respiratory failure was in 1971 by Dr. J.D. Hill and colleagues. The patient received venoarterial extracorporeal support with a Bramson membrane lung for 75 h and survived [3]. This success prompted others to attempt the institution of ECMO support for severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, with reports of approximately 150 cases performed from the original Hill report through 1974, though mortality was 85\u201390 % [4\u20136]. In 1979, Warren Zapol and colleagues published the results of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of mechanical ventilation supplemented with venoarterial ECMO versus conventional mechanical ventilation alone, according to the standard of care at that time, as a therapy for severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [7]. Ninety subjects were randomized to conventional mechanical ventilation alone or mechanical ventilation and ECMO, with slow and fast entry criteria utilized for enrollment based on a combination of severity and duration of hypoxemia, resulting in a maximum PaO2 to FiO2 ratio of 83. Subjects with prolonged mechanical ventilation (greater than 21 days), evidence of left atrial hypertension (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than 25), and chronic or irreversible diseases were excluded. The trial demonstrated no significant difference in survival (9.5 % in the ECMO group, 8.3 % in the control group, Table 2.1), with high rates of infectious and bleeding complications. The low rate of survival in the control group also highlights the high severity of illness in the study population and the different standard of care for mechanical ventilation in ARDS at that time.\n",

The concept involved using venovenous extracorporeal support at low blood flow rates principally to remove CO2, a technique known as extracorporeal CO2 removal or ECCO2R. By removing CO2 directly from the blood, they could ventilate the subjects at lower airway pressures and respiratory rates\u2014what they termed \u201clow-frequency positive-pressure ventilation\u201d (LFPPV) while providing passive oxygenation through the endotracheal tube [8\u201311]. The goal was to provide what Gattinoni referred to as \u201cpulmonary rest,\u201d the precursor to low-volume, low-pressure ventilation strategies [11]. Results of a prospective, uncontrolled study of 43 subjects treated with a LFPPV-ECCO2R strategy for severe respiratory failure (average PaO2 to FIO2 ratio of 67) demonstrated a survival of 49 %, despite an anticipated survival of less than 10 % based on similar inclusion and exclusion criteria to those used in the trial by Zapol [9].",

            "text": "Prompted by a significantly higher survival than prior studies of subjects with severe ARDS, a lack of randomization or control group in the Gattinoni study, and the hypothesis that ventilator-associated lung injury plays a critical role in mortality in ARDS, Morris and colleagues at the University of Utah evaluated the role of LFPPV-ECCO2R in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of subjects with severe ARDS [12]. Forty subjects were randomized between 1987 and 1991 to receive either conventional mechanical ventilation or a strategy of pressure-control inverse ratio ventilation (PCIRV), followed by LFPPV-ECCO2R if PCIRV was unable to maintain adequate PaO2 or pH. Entry criteria were similar to those used by Zapol and Gattinoni. Oxygenation was markedly impaired, with an average PaO2 to FIO2 ratio of 63. The results demonstrated no difference in mortality between groups, with a survival of 42 % in the control group and 33 % in the PCIRV plus LFPPV-ECCO2R group. Hemorrhage with high rates of transfusion led to ECCO2R discontinuation in seven (37 %) of the subjects in the experimental group, and four subjects (21 %) developed clot within the extracorporeal circuit. Although the authors concluded there was no role for ECCO2R as a therapy for ARDS, there were several notable limitations of this trial. The intervention group received two different experimental treatment modalities (inverse ratio ventilation and ECCO2R), worldwide experience with extracorporeal techniques was limited prior to study initiation, and the intervention arm was exposed to notably high airway pressures despite extracorporeal support. Additionally, survival among those in the control group was higher than in the previous studies, highlighting the differences in patient characteristics, therapeutic interventions, or protocols for respiratory care between this study and previously published data. Furthermore, while all of these studies used uniform entry criteria that facilitate comparisons between trials, these criteria may not reflect best practice for the initiation of extracorporeal support.",

All cases were confirmed or strongly suspected to be a result of influenza A(H1N1), with a high severity of illness as demonstrated by ventilatory parameters: median PaO2 to FIO2 ratio of 56, median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cm H2O, median nadir pH of 7.2, and median highest PaCO2 of 69.

Only 69 of the 80 subjects referred for ECMO received ECMO (86 %). However, statistical analysis was performed by intention-to-treat principles. Individual, propensity score, and GenMatch matching were used to match subjects from each group on the basis of demographic, physiologic, and comorbidity data that were anticipated a priori to be associated with ECMO use and hospital mortality (prior duration of mechanical ventilation, PaO2 to FIO2 ratio, age, SOFA score, body mass index (BMI), pregnancy status, and use of alternative ventilation strategies). After matching for the above variables, the ECMO-referred subjects consistently had a mortality approximately half that of the non-ECMO-referred subjects (24 % vs. 47 % by propensity score matching, RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.31\u20130.84, p = 0.008).

This is evident in the decline in mortality rates observed in ARDS over the last decade [28], with mortality of 31 % in the intervention arm of ARMA in 2000 [29], 25 % in the fluid-conservative strategy arm in FACTT in 2006, and 16\u201318 % in the control arms of ALTA and OMEGA in 2011 [30\u201332]. Likewise, ECMO technology has evolved significantly since the early randomized trials, with more efficient membranes for gas exchange, the advent of centrifugal pumps, heparin-coated circuits that can tolerate lower levels of anticoagulation resulting in lower bleeding risk, and cannulae that permit single-vessel access with minimal recirculation. Comparisons of non-randomized ECMO studies are also confounded by indication, which is influenced by multiple factors, including but not limited to patient age, disease severity, concomitant medical conditions, concurrent therapies, and physicians\u2019 estimation of prognosis.",

In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, 180 subjects, age 18\u201365, with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure and a Lung Injury Score (a.k.a. Murray Score, a composite score based on PaO2 to FIO2 ratio, PEEP, respiratory system compliance, and radiographic findings [34]) of \u22653.0 or uncompensated hypercapnia (pH < 7.2) despite \u201coptimal conventional management\u201d were randomly assigned to receive ongoing conventional mechanical ventilation at designated treatment centers or be transferred to a single ECMO center at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester for consideration of treatment with venovenous ECMO. Subjects were excluded from the trial if they had contraindications to anticoagulation or if they had been on high pressure (peak inspiratory airway pressure >30 cm H2O) or high FIO2 (>0.8) for greater than 7 days. Hemodynamically stable subjects randomized to the ECMO referral arm were initially managed on transfer to Glenfield with a standardized management protocol that included a pressure-restricted ventilation strategy, diuresis to dry weight, transfusion to a hematocrit of 40 %, prone positioning and full nutrition. Those who were hemodynamically unstable or failed to respond to this strategy within 12 h were placed on ECMO. Only 76 % of the subjects referred for ECMO actually received ECMO, however all subjects who received ECMO were managed with a lung-protective ventilation strategy. In total, 93 % of subjects in the ECMO referral arm received treatment with a low-volume, low-pressure strategy at some point in their care. By comparison, because there was no mandate of a lung-protective ventilation strategy in the conventional management group (a low-volume, low-pressure strategy was advised) and perhaps because many of these subjects were difficult to ventilate, only 70 % of those subjects were managed with such a strategy at any time during the study. Subjects were well-matched between groups and the majority were randomized early in ARDS, with 62 % of ECMO subjects and 66 % of conventionally managed subjects having been on high pressure or high FIO2 for 48 h or less, with an average of 28 h in each group. Average PaO2 to FIO2 was approximately 75 in both groups. The primary outcome\u2014death or severe disability by 6 months after randomization\u2014occurred in 37 % of the subjects referred for ECMO, as compared with 53 % of those in the conventional management group, relative risk 0.69 (95 % confidence interval 0.05\u20130.97, p = 0.03).",

Centers that already offer ECMO and believe in its utility in ARDS may find it difficult to withhold ECMO from subjects who are failing mechanical ventilation alone, and have a need to permit crossover within the study, which may bias results toward the null hypothesis when analyzed by intention to treat. Nonetheless, a carefully designed clinical trial that adequately matches for baseline demographics and potential confounders and adheres to treatment protocols would provide useful additional evidence to help settle the ongoing debate about the role of ECMO in severe ARDS.",

            "text": "The early randomized trials used two sets of criteria to assess the need for ECMO: PaO2 less than 50 mmHg for 2 h at FIO2 1.0 and PEEP greater 5 cm H2O (fast-entry criteria) or PaO2 less than 50 mmHg for greater than 12 h at FIO2 greater than 0.6, PEEP greater than 5 cm H2O, and shunt fraction (Q\ns/Q\nt) greater than 0.3 despite 48 h of maximal medical therapy (slow-entry criteria) [7, 12]. While these criteria take into account the risks of prolonged hypoxemia and oxygen toxicity, there is no consideration of hypercapnia with resulting acidemia or plateau airway pressures as factors that may influence the decision to initiate ECMO. Furthermore, the specific time and oxygenation cutoffs used for entry criteria have not been independently validated or shown to correlate with mortality. Among the best data available to estimate the prognosis of patients with ARDS without ECMO support comes from the work of the ARDS Definition Task Force [1], which redefined ARDS based on the degree of hypoxemia as a predictor of mortality. Lower PaO2 to FIO2 ratio cutoffs correlate with increased mortality (45 % when PaO2 to FIO2 is less than 100, vs. 27\u201332 % in mild to moderate ARDS) and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (9 days in severe ARDS vs. 5\u20137 days in mild to moderate ARDS). Based on these data, patients with lower ratios of PaO2 to FIO2 would seem to benefit the most from aggressive interventions. However, the appropriate cut off for initiating ECMO has yet to be determined. Given the consensus decision by the ARDSnet trial investigators to set a goal PaO2 of 55\u201380 mmHg [29], ultimately representing a range of values within which the amount of PEEP or FIO2 is not deescalated because the patient is presumed to be near the steep portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, one may consider a PaO2 to FIO2 ratio of 80 as a reasonable cutoff for consideration of ECMO (Table 2.3) [2]. This threshold is similar to the PaO2 to FIO2 ratio that was used as part of the slow entry criteria in the early ECMO trials [7, 12], and at the upper limit of many observational studies [15\u201322, 24, 25]. The PaO2 to FIO2 ratio is one component of the Lung Injury Score which uses a combination of physiologic and radiographic characteristics to quantify the extent of lung injury in ARDS [34]. However, because of its non-physiologic component and a lack of data to support its ability to predict survival among patients with the most severe forms of ARDS, it may be less useful as a criterion for initiation of ECMO.\n",

Nonetheless, many of the studies involving ECMO for ARDS have documented high levels of PEEP to improve oxygenation prior to the initiation of ECMO. It is reasonable to attempt to achieve levels of PEEP up to 15\u201320 cm H2O, in conjunction with increases in FIO2, to reach an adequate level of oxygenation prior to the initiation of ECMO, assuming those levels of PEEP do not significantly compromise the patient\u2019s hemodynamic status.",

A pH less than 7.15 may therefore be a reasonable threshold to initiate ECMO in attempting to avoid exceeding plateau airway pressure limits that may worsen ventilator-associated lung injury. Along similar lines, a third indication for the initiation of ECMO is excessively high plateau airway pressures themselves, despite adherence to the best accepted standard of care for ventilator management. Plateau airway pressures exceeding 35 cm H2O have been shown to correlate with significantly higher incidence of barotrauma [41]. A reasonable range of plateau airway pressures in which to consider ECMO initiation is 35\u201345 cm H2O depending on the patient\u2019s body habitus [2]. Patients with higher BMI will have higher elastic loads on the chest wall than those with lower BMI, and thus may require higher plateau airway pressures to achieve the same degree of alveolar patency, though the transpulmonary pressure gradient may not be higher.",

Any condition that precludes the use of anticoagulation is typically considered an absolute contraindication because of the need for systemic anticoagulant therapy to maintain the integrity of the circuit. However, in patients with severe bleeding, anticoagulation may be withheld for significant periods of time with apparent safety [42]. Given the advances in technology, the inability to anticoagulate should perhaps be considered only a relative contraindication to receiving ECMO. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is another disorder that may be problematic because of the high risk of thrombosis (within the patient or the circuit) if platelet transfusion is needed in the setting of life-threatening hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. While this may not be an absolute contraindication, the likelihood of survival without ECMO would have to be sufficiently low to consider accepting such a high risk.",

            "text": "The theoretical benefit of ECMO for severe cases of ARDS largely relates to lung protection: a decreased need for high-pressure ventilation or toxic fractions of inspired oxygen. Yet, this potential for benefit may be limited if the patient has already been exposed to high airway pressures and inspired oxygen levels such that damage is irreversible. Many clinicians think that patients who have been receiving high-pressure ventilation with plateau pressure exceeding 30 cm H2O for greater than 7 days are less likely to benefit from ECMO [43\u201345]. Similarly, prolonged exposure to high fractions of inspired oxygen, which may induce lung inflammation, could nullify any beneficial effect of ECMO support, though this remains an area of controversy [46, 47]. Earlier initiation of ECMO, perhaps for these or other reasons, has been associated with better outcomes in some, but not all, observational studies [18, 45, 48, 49]. Other relative contraindications include limitations in vascular access that would preclude cannula placement and any conditions in which ECMO would be unlikely to alter the patient\u2019s overall prognosis, including but not limited to advanced malignancy or severe and irreversible brain injury. Finally, ECMO, when considered as a bridge to lung transplantation, should only be offered if the patient is actually a candidate for transplantation.",
