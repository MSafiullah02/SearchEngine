            "text": "The Polyomaviridae family is constituted by small double-stranded DNA viruses which are widespread in the human population with a seroprevalence of 60\u201380% in adults. Two polyomaviruses are known to infect humans, JC virus (JCV) and BK virus (BKV), both discovered in 1971 (Gardner et al., 1971, Padgett et al., 1971). SV40, another polyomavirus which infects naturally the rhesus monkey, was introduced accidentally into the human population as a contaminant during the early use of poliomyelitis vaccines (Butel and Lednicky, 1999, Bergallo et al., 2007). Following primary infection, which occurs usually through the respiratory tract and is often asymptomatic, polyomaviruses can establish latency in the urinary tract, brain, and in the B cells (Jiang et al., 2009). Reactivation is frequent in immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients, with severe consequences (Costa et al., 2008). Two novel polyomaviruses have been described recently and named Karolinska Institutet virus (KIV) and Washington University virus (WUV) (Allander et al., 2007, Gaynor et al., 2007). KIV and WUV have been isolated first in respiratory secretions from human patients with acute respiratory tract symptoms and, in the case of KIV, also in faecal samples (Allander et al., 2007, Gaynor et al., 2007, Babakir-Mina et al., 2008, Babakir-Mina et al., 2009, Jiang et al., 2009). WUV shares only 15\u201349% identity with BKV and JCV and is most similar to KIV. KIV and WUV nonstructural proteins display amino acid sequence similar to those of the other primate polyomaviruses, while the structural proteins exhibit a very low degree of similarity to those of other known polyomaviruses, suggesting that WUV and KIV define a novel branch within the Polyomaviridae family with unexplored biology and controversial clinical significance (Allander et al., 2007, Gaynor et al., 2007, Norja et al., 2007). The development of molecular assays, such as Real Time PCR, for KIV and WUV detection could be useful to determine the epidemiology, pathogenesis and pathogenic role of the two viruses in different clinical syndromes. In a Real Time PCR protocol design different parameters, such as the target region and the conditions of amplification, have to be considered in order to obtain enhanced sensitivity and specificity. In a high-throughput routine laboratory, the use of \u201cin-house\u201d protocols requires optimization, standardization, and validation processes, consisting in the assessment of sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, precision and linearity. Furthermore, the choice of the sample material, also referred to as the matrix, could have a strong influence on the results and has to be considered in the validation process (Dimech et al., 2004, Rabenau et al., 2007).",

The advantages of these systems, in comparison to conventional PCR, include a reduced turnaround time, minimising of the potential for carry-over contamination and the ability to scrutinise closely the assay performance, thus representing a suitable tool for routine diagnosis in virology. Real Time PCR offers significant improvements to viral load quantitation because of its wide dynamic range which can accommodate at least eight log 10 copies of nucleic acid template. This is made possible because the data are chosen from the linear phase of amplification where conditions are optimal, rather than the end-point where the final amount of amplicon may have been affected by inhibitors, poorly optimized reaction conditions or saturation by inhibitory PCR by-products and double-stranded amplicon. In regards to Real Time PCR, the design of primer/probe sets, although relatively simple from a computational point of view, has to take into account several factors, especially the choice of target region.",

The assays developed in this study show complete sequence homology with all the KIV and 12 WUV isolates; this is due to the presence of a puntiform mutation in the target region VP2.
