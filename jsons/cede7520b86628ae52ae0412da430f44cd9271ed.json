We analyzed the clinical features and cytokine responses of HRV isolates in children with respiratory infections. Quantitative analysis and genotyping of the HRV-positive samples from 601 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were performed using VP4/VP2 sequencing. To compare T-helper1 (Th1) type (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) and Th2 type (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine responses between HRV-A, B and C, the levels of the four cytokines were measured. The HRV-positive children had shorter fever duration (P = 0.018), and higher frequencies of chest retraction (P = 0.002) and wheezing (P = 0.022) than did the HRVnegative group. HRV-A was identified in 55 cases (58.5%), HRV-B in 8 (8.5%), and HRV-C in 31 (33.0%). There were no significant differences in the clinical data or NPA cytokines levels between patients with HRV-A and HRV-C infections. HRV is an important pathogen of the lower respiratory tract in young children. HRV-A and HRV-C are the dominant species that cause respiratory difficulty in young children.",

Patients were excluded if they were immunocompromised due to HIV infection, malignancy, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation or use of immunosuppressive drugs such as long-term systemic corticosteroids or radiation therapy. NPAs were obtained by suction using a fine, flexible plastic catheter and syringe. After collection, NPAs were immediately transported at 4\u02daC to the laboratory, where they were stored at -70\u02daC until use. Patient demographic and clinical data including medical history, detailed signs and symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory and radiology results were collected from a retrospective review of the medical records and interviews upon admission. Disease severity was assessed according to a respiratory symptom scoring system based on previously published studies [7, 8] .",

In accordance with previous studies [13, [23] [24] [25] , we found that HRV-B was the least frequently detected HRV species, and chest retraction infections caused by this virus was not observed. There are two hypotheses to explain this. It is possible that HRV-B causes a mild form of disease that does not warrant hospitalization, accounting for its lower detection rate in hospital-based studies compared to those of the other HRV species. Another possibility is that the genetic and biological fitness of HRV-B leads to its low frequency. One recent article reported that, even in healthy young children, HRV-B was the least frequently detected species of the three [26] . This finding supports the hypothesis that the frequency and virulence of HRV-B may be related to its genetic fitness, rather than selection bias.",

Most previous studies reported that a high HRV viral load was correlated to clinical severity or wheezing [27] [28] [29] . However, other reports show no correlation between the viral load and severity of the lower respiratory infection [30, 31] . Similarly, we did not observe a correlation between the HRV viral load and clinical features or laboratory data. Our results suggest that the difference in disease severity may be more related to the host's susceptibility to HRV than to the viral load. Viral load can vary according to the sampling process. Therefore, the exact relationship between HRV viral load and disease severity merits further investigation.",
