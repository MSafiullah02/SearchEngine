Spices like sumac are used mainly in the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean regions, while fragrant pandan is prevalent in countries in the Far East and Pacific regions. Pink pepper is a specialty of South and Central American cuisines. Morphologically these spices vary from a rhizomatous perennial herb (mango ginger) to small herbs (rue) to fairly large trees (Californian pink pepper tree). In this chapter, these spices and their role in cooking are dealt with briefly. In addition brief notes are also provided on 12 other minor herbs and spices.",

Major compounds identified include ocimene, linalool, linalyl acetate, safrole, curcumene, \u03b4-3-carene, (Z)-\u03b2-\u03b2-ocimene, dihydrocimenes, myrcene and 1,8-cineole. (Chaudhuary et al., 1996; Gupta et al., 1999, Srivastava et al., 2001, Singh et al., 2002, Mustafa et al., 2005). Another study using advanced gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) led to the identification of 26 components comprising almost 98 % of the total volatiles (Mustafa et al., 2005). The oil contained ten monoterpenes, three hydrocarbons, four oxygenated hydrocarbons, two ketones and one ester. The predominant monoterpenes are camphor and thymol. The sequiterpene fraction consisted mainly of hydrocarbons such as (Z)-\u03b2-farnasene, guaia-6,9-diene, \u03b1-pinene and \u03b1-longipinene. The aromatic constituent contributing to the flavour is thymol. Jatoi et al. (2007) studied the chemical composition of mango ginger from Japan and reported over 130 compounds with biological activities, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and insecticidal properties. Nahar and Sarker (2007) provide an exhaustive list of the chemical constituents of various species of Curcuma including C. amada.\n",

It is used in the treatment of weak nerves (neurasthenia), lack of appetite, hair loss and to darken hair and prevent dandruff. In Thailand, pandan leaves are used as a traditional medicine for treating diabetes. The mode of administration is usually as juice or as a concentrated infusion taken with or without the addition of sugar. Locally it is also used as a treatment for wounds, as an antipyretic, to relieve headache and earache, as a laxative for children, for relief from chest pains, in helping women to recuperate after delivery and in reducing stomach spasms (Wongpornchai, 2006, Anon., 2012a).",

Juice expressed from the leaves is used to impart flavour and colour to foodstuffs. Pandan leaves release their aroma when sliced, and have a subtle grassy-nutty flavour, making them suitable for use in pot pourris alongside flower petals, especially rose. They are widely used in many Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, India and even in Australia in a variety of dishes, including rice dishes, puddings, beverages and curries. Nasi lemak, nasi kuning and nasi padang are some of the pandan leaf-flavoured rice dishes widely eaten in Malaysia and Indonesia, and the leaf paste is used in green Thai and Malaysian curries; the flavour goes very well with coconut milk, glutinous rice, lemon grass, milk, brown sugar and turmeric. In India, pandan leaves, as well as pandan flowers from the related species Pandanus fascicularis (common screw pine, the Ketaki flower), are used to perfume biryani and other rice dishes and also used in spice blends. Pandan leaves are also used as wrappers in South East Asian cooking in order to provide a distinct flavour to foods. They are wrapped around chicken, pork, fish and desserts before grilling, roasting, barbecuing or steaming. The leaves also provide the green colour and flavour in Indonesian, Thai, Malaysian and Nonya-style rice baked desserts, candies, puddings, soups and coconut milk. In fact, all over South East Asia, the most important culinary application of pandan leaves is in desserts (Anon., 2012a). In Indonesia, pandan leaves are made into ice cream-like concoctions. Pandan leaves are also used in sweet puddings or custards based on sticky rice covered in thick coconut milk (Routray and Rayaguru, 2010). Indian desserts such as rasagolla, gulab jamun and rasmalai also often contain pandan leaf. Many dishes containing pandan leaf flavouring can be found on well-known recipe sites, including: coconut pandan rice custard, coconut pandan chiffon cake, pandan fudge cake, Thai pandan chicken, chicken wrapped in pandan leaves, Thai pandan custard, nasi kuning \u2013 festive yellow rice, Indonesian rice with pandan, lod-chong nam ka-ti (pandan noodles with coconut milk), buko pandan, pandan waffle, Thai pandan chicken, pandan coconut muffins.",

Both pink peppers cause allergic reactions such as skin irritations and respiratory difficulties when the tree is in bloom, and allergic reactions can also result from excessive consumption. This allergic property seems to be due to the presence of urushiol-type allergens, but the spice grown in R\u00e9union appears to be free of urushiols, and the less effective cardanoles (3-alkylphenoles) were found in lower concentration than in Florida-grown pink pepper (Katzer, 2002).

A number of recipes using pink pepper can be found on recipe sites, including the following: miso cod with deep fried cabbage and pink peppercorn dressed cabbage; peppercorn salmon; smoky lamb kebabs; ceviche with crab salad and ciabatta; Sardinian octopus; panfried sea bass; duck fillets; roasted duck breast with pink peppercorn sauce; peppered duck; salt marsh lamb with woodland mushroom and sorrel; spiced pork burgers.",

It has been used in the treatment of disorders of the nervous system such as multiple sclerosis and Bell\u2019s palsy, as well as in curing dizziness and vertigo. Rue is beneficial in treating gastrointestinal complaints such as colic and flatulence; in these cases, rue essential oil should be taken internally, mixed with water and sugar. If an overdose is taken, the herb acts as an acro-narcotic poison. It also tends to induce vomiting; any treatment should therefore not be taken directly after eating. Externally, it can be used as an ointment, while the leaves help to relieve pain caused by sciatica. Fresh leaves placed on the forehead are said to cure headaches, and a compressed and saturated decoction prepared from rue leaves applied to the chest helps in treating persistent bronchitis. Chewing rue leaves helps to eliminate bacteria on the gums (Grieve, 1931b).",

Fresh rue leaves are sometimes used as a coffee flavourant (remember that coffee is probably native to Ethiopia), and rue is also sometimes mentioned as a components in the national spice mix, berbere. Ethiopian cuisine is unique in using not only rue leaves, but also dried fruits (rue berries) with their more intensive, slightly pungent flavour that is well preserved on drying.\nTo cook with rue is usually considered old-fashioned, which is probably because half a century ago, rue was significantly more popular than today so that it is seen a leftover from past times; second, older people frequently develop a positive attitude towards bitter taste and tend to use bitter herbs and spices more liberally. And yet, rue is definitely worth a try; meat, eggs and cheese all can profit from this nearly unknown spice, provided care is taken not to overdose. The bitter taste is reduced by acids; thus, a leaf of rue may be used to flavour pickled vegetables, make a salad more interesting or add a very personal touch to home-made herbal vinegar.\nBecause of its general affinity to acidic food, rue goes well with spicy Italian tomato sauces containing olives and capers (together with marjoram, basil and lovage). If a cook wants rue flavour without bitterness, he might make use of the fact that rue leaves excrete the essential oil much more quickly than the bitter rutin (very similar to tea leaves). Thus, the fresh leaves may be soaked in a slightly boiling sauce for a short time (typically, one minute) and discarded afterwards. By this a procedure, a maximum of flavour at a minimum of bitterness is achieved \u2026\nLike many other bitter spices \u2026 rue is popular for flavouring liquors. Besides stimulating the appetite, bitter liquors have some tonic, stomachic and even bile-stimulating properties, all of which are advantageous after a rich feast. One of the most common liquors containing rue is grappa con ruta, an Italian draff brandy flavoured with a small branch of rue per bottle. For this, the related Fringed Rue (Aleppo rue, R. chalepensis) is usually preferred.\n",

When the tissue gets damaged or cut or ground, the glucosinolates are acted upon by the enzyme myrosinase. Isothiocynates are the final product of this enzymatic reaction, which is aided by neutral and alkaline conditions. Wasabi contains several types of isothiocynates, and the flavour quality of wasabi varieties differ depending upon the relative concentration of these compounds. So far, about 116 isothiocynates have been reported in wasabi (Masuda et al., 1996, Anon., 2011).",

Recently, it has found widespread appeal in western cuisine due to its ability to change an ordinary dish to an extra special one by improving the taste (with addition of a spicy flavour). As a result, it is fast becoming a new flavour for the rest of the world. All the plant parts of wasabi possess same flavour but vary in the sharpness they deliver\u2019 and are, therefore, used for different purposes. Basically, wasabi can be served in three ways. These are as a condiment on the side of a dish, as a spice or herb in a dish and as wasabi flavour in processed foods. Rhizomes are the most popular tissues used to prepare fresh paste to be placed in a mound on a dish next to sliced raw fish (sashimi), spread on the raw fish in sushi preparations, or served on a small dish to accompany a bowl of cooked noodles. Sometimes grated wasabi is mixed with other ingredients like soya sauce and vinegar to prepare a dip for use with raw fish or other dishes, according to individual\u2019s choice. Tofu (soybean curd) is often decorated with grated wasabi. Wasabi petioles and leaves are pickled in sake brine or soya sauce and are popular accompaniments for white rice. Sometimes fresh leaves are used in salads and dried leaves are used to flavour cheese, salad dressings or crackers. A wasabi wine is sold (mainly as a novelty) in some Japanese specialty stores, as well as a high alcohol content wasabi liqueur.\n",

Boldo leaves are strongly aromatic, similar to cinnamon or bay leaves and, when used, impart a very agreeable aroma to dishes. They are most useful in fish dishes, and can also enrich the taste and flavour of sauces, mushroom dishes, pickled vegetables and gravies. Boldo leaves contain about 2 % essential oil, which contributes to the flavour and aroma of this leaf. The main component of the essential oil is ascaridol, a monoterpene peroxide with a disagreeable smell and found only very rarely in plants. The flavour-contributing compounds are p-cymene, 1,8-cineol and linalool. The leaves also contain alkaloids such as boldine, isoboldine and N-methyllaurotetanine. They are used in herbal teas, and were part of traditional Mayan medicine. Research has verified the various indigenous uses of boldo leaves: in animal studies, they have been shown to stimulate digestion and to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and bile-producing and diuretic properties which are attributed largely to the plant chemical boldine. A US monograph reports that boldo can increase urine output by 50 %, which again validates the plant\u2019s traditional use as a diuretic (Taylor, 2004, Katzer, 1998a). An ethanol extract of the leaf administered to mice was shown to have a liver protective effect, preventing damage from chemical exposure. The extract also relaxes smooth muscle tissue and prolongs intestinal transit.",

Tropeolaceae). Garden cress and water cress belong to the mustard family (Brassicaceae), and nasturtium belongs to the Tropeolaceae family. All three types of cress have similar flavour qualities and are used in similar ways. Cresses have a spicy aroma and a refreshing peppery, pungent taste. The unique taste and flavour are due to the presence of isothiocynate derivatives, which are characteristic of plants in the mustard family. The main component of water and garden cresses is gluconasturin, which yields 2-phenylethyl-isothiocyanate. Nasturtium leaves contain glucotropeolin, which on hydrolysis gives benzyl-isothiocyanate. Cresses must be used fresh: they cannot be dried because drying removes the flavour almost completely. Cresses are used in local traditional medicine as a remedy for cough, cold, asthma, diabetes, anaemia, constipation and also as a body deodorizer. They are also a good source of iodine (Shipard, 2003). All three cresses are very commonly used in European and American cuisines. In America, they are used for spreads (especially based on cheese) and salads and often served along with bread and butter. Chopped cress leaves are used as toppings on warm dishes like vegetable soups, scrambled eggs and fish dishes. In Europe, cress leaves are used in flavouring vinegar, sauces and soups, particularly in the form of a herb mixture known as mustard cress. This is a mixture of mustard and garden cress seedlings grown together for use (Katzer, 2012c). The BBC cook book lists 107 recipes using cresses. (Anon., 2011c).",

All aerial plant parts of this herb contain essential oil (0.7 % in the leaves, 2.5 % in the unripe fruits), which is composed of various monoterpenoids (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, thymol, myrcene, p-cymene, terpinene, campher, trans-isocarveol) and ascaridole, a monoterpenoid peroxide (Katzer, 2000c, Stuart, 2003). Its essential oil and its infusion are anthelmintic; the oil is active against intestinal nematodes, and aqueous extract is active against plant nematodes. Methanol extracts are anti-inflammatory and analgesic and ethanol extracts are used to reduce tumour growth, most likely due to an immunomodulatory effect. Tea made from its dried leaves is patented as a treatment for uterine fibroids (Diroff, 2008). Diroff (2008) has provided a detailed review on all aspects of epazote, including its medicinal properties and, biological actions. The herb is used fresh in soups, salads, meat dishes, sauces and, most commonly, in bean dishes (such as the famous Mexican refried beans). It is also used in Mexico as herbal tea.

The plant is found in northern Europe, West Asia and the USA. Gale leaves are aromatic, and can be used either fresh or dried, the aroma intensifying after drying. The leaf contains essential oil, the main components of which are \u03b1-pinene, 1,8-cineol, myrcene and limonene. Gale leaves are used like bay and cinnamon leaves: the whole leaf should be steeped in the dish during preparation, and the leaves are removed before serving. Gale leaves impart a very agreeable and pleasant flavour to boiled vegetable stews and legume dishes, but are less commonly used in meat dishes. Historically, the most important use of gale leaf has been for flavouring beer. In the Scandinavian countries, gale leaves are also used to flavour schnapps (a type of distilled alcoholic beverage) (Katzer, 2003b, Anon., 2011)",

In one, the predominant component is citral (citral type) and in the other, the main component is citronellal (citronellal type). The former is more common and is the one used for culinary purposes. It is often described as the queen of lemon herbs, because its essential oil contains around 95\u201397 % citrals, in contrast to lemon peel, which contains only up to 10 % citrals. The oil of lemon myrtle is antifungal, antiseptic, antiviral, calmative and sedative. Its fragrance, together with its medicinal properties, makes it ideal for use in cosmetics, toiletries, incense burners and massage oils. Citral is used extensively as a food flavouring, but a leaf or two of lemon myrtle is a good substitute. Lemon myrtle is used in cooking and it blends well with macadamia nut oil. The leaves are used fresh, dry, as powder or as encapsulated extracted flavour. It is used widely in a variety of food products from bread to pasta, in fish preparations, as a herbal tea, in milk-based products, creams, cheesecakes; and also in native beer. Lemon myrtle is also a widely grown ornamental and avenue tree (Katzer, 1999).",

It is known as hoja santa in Mexico, which means sacred leaf. Mexican pepper leaf and its young stems are widely used to flavour various dishes in Mexican cuisine; outside Mexico it is seldom used mainly due to a lack of availability. Both fresh and dried leaves are used; they have a pleasant aroma, somewhat akin to anise, nutmeg and black pepper. The young stems have a stronger flavour, which is also warm and mildly pungent. Safrole is the major component of the Mexican pepper leaf; minor components include \u03b1-pinene, camphene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, myrcene and \u03b1-phellandrene (Gupta et al., 1985). Mexican pepper leaf is also used medicinally by the local people in Mexico. It is said to help relieve nervous anxiety, stress and restlessness. It can be eaten or taken as a tea; however, it is very powerful and should be used on a limited basis. Long-term use may cause liver problems.",

            "text": "Mountain pepper or Tasmanian pepper (Tasmania lanceolata L.; Mountain pepper, Australian pepper tree; Winteraceae) is native to Australia (New South Wales), and plays an important role in Australian cuisine. For cooking, the dried berries and dried powdered leaf are used; both have a strong woody fragrance, with a black pepper-like taste with a cinnamon-like notes. Tasmanian pepper is initially intensely hot and pungent, so caution is required in its use. It then produces a strange sensation of numbness similar to the effect of Szechuan pepper. The component responsible for this pungency is polygodial, which is a dialdehyde with a bicyclic sesquiterpenoid skeleton. Tasmanian pepper goes well with other aromatic herbs and can be mixed with other spices like coriander, lemon myrtle, wattle seed and salt. In Australia, it is essential for preparing bush food dishes, like emu burgers, kangaroo steaks and so on. The berries are crushed and mixed with oil, and the resulting product is used for marinating meat. The berries are used in flavoured breads, pastas and pat\u00e9s, mustards and cheeses. In stews or sauces this spice imparts a vibrant red colour which can be very attractive. Tasmanian pepper is now being marketed internationally and is available in many western supermarkets. Dishes using Tasmanian pepper include: salmon with acacia seed and Tasmanian pepper berries, Australasian roast pork, Australasian roast chicken, balmian bugs and whiting, and Tasmanian pepper beef stew (Katzer, 2001a).",

Young shoots form the useful part. This plant has no smell but a very pungent taste and, like Tasmanian pepper, produces numbness in the tongue and mouth. The leaf contains essential oil, the main components of which are \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, 1,4-cineol, fenchone, \u03b1-humulene, \u03b2-caryophyllene and trans-\u03b2-bergamotene. As with Tasmanian pepper, the bicyclic sesquiterpenoid, polygodial, has been found to be responsible for the pungent taste. The pungency imparted by the water pepper is such that it is difficult to substitute it with any other spice. However, the use of water pepper is restricted to Japanese cooking and to the cuisine of some areas of South East Asia such as Vietnam. In Japanese cookery, water pepper leaf is widely used in soups, salads, and also for garnishing sushi. Since water pepper does not have a taste or flavour of its own except pungency, it is used in Japanese cuisine wherever pungency is required without masking the original flavour and taste of a dish and its ingredients, such as in fish recipes and sushi. Certain types of water pepper have very low pungency, and these are used in Japan as a vegetable. Water pepper seeds are also very pungent, and were used once as a substitute for black pepper, but are rarely used today (Katzer, 2000d).",
