            "text": "Influenza viruses (IVs) cause annual epidemics and occasional pandemics in the human population with severe impact on global health. While influenza A viruses (IAVs) occur in different subtypes and infect a range of other species, the monophyletic influenza B viruses are largely confined to humans. All IVs contain a segmented RNA genome of negative polarity. The viral RNAs are sensed by the cytoplasmic RIG-I sensor that initiates a signaling pathway leading to production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines [1,2,3,4]. Type I IFNs activate the expression of several hundred gene products, many of which can confer an antiviral state to the cell [5,6]. The family of RIG-I-like receptors includes RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, all of which share a common DExD/H-box RNA-dependent helicase domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD) [7]. In addition, RIG-I and MDA5 have two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) which are the responsible signaling mediators. RIG-I senses short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with 5\u2032-di- or triphosphate ends (5\u2032-PP, or 5\u2032-PPP, respectively) from different RNA viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as IV in many cell types [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Upon ligand recognition, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change from its autorepressed form into an active state by unmasking the CARD domains [7]. Oligomerization of RIG-I on RNA ligands drives the formation of helical CARD domain filaments which recruits and organizes the downstream adapter MAVS (also known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif) into similar filamentous aggregates [14]. This mediates activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 through the phosphorylation by I\u03ba-B kinase family members TBK1 and IKK\u03b5. IRF3/7 translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of type I IFN [15]. A key mechanism for the regulation of RIG-I activation involves its activation by covalent K63 chain ubiquitination mediated by the E3 ligases Riplet, TRIM25, Ube2D3, and MEX3C. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I is negatively controlled through phosphorylation by PKCs, DAPKI, and CKII [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Also several other interacting proteins, like PACT, ZAPS, and OASL have been shown to regulate RIG-I activation [25,26,27,28,29], but additional regulators may exist. In addition to the production of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines, cells have evolved other RNA-triggered defense mechanisms against viral infections. For instance, protein kinase R (PKR) is activated following binding of viral RNA and can induce translation arrest by phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) [30]. Stalled translation machinery is then accumulated in stress granules (SGs), which are dynamic cytosolic aggregates that contain translationally arrested mRNAs, 40S ribosomes, and various RNA-binding proteins like TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 [31,32]. Importantly, it has been recently suggested, that SGs serve as assembly platforms for the shaping of an antiviral host response and their presence correlates with reduced virus replication [33,34]. Thus, antiviral SGs (avSG) triggered by infection with IV, hepatitis C virus or coronaviruses also contain many antiviral proteins like RIG-I, MAVS, or PKR, indicating a crosstalk between these pathways occurring here. In addition, virus ribonucleoprotein complexes are present in SGs, yet how this contributes to the host antiviral response is not well established [35,36].",

Furthermore, NS1 also prevents the activation of PKR [18,38,39]. By this means, IV is able to inhibit PKR-dependent translational arrest and avSG formation.",

DDX6 colocalized with RIG-I in SGs, however the function of DDX6 in RIG-I\u2019s signaling pathway was independent of SG formation. DDX6 overexpression increased IFN-\u03b2 production in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, knockdown of DDX6 reduced IFN-\u03b2 production. Finally, DDX6 bound IV RNA with the ability to stimulate RIG-I. Taken together, these results show that DDX6 is a novel RIG-I regulator that plays a positive role in RIG-I mediated production of type I IFN.",

Due to the different labels, peptides from each state generated in the MS work flow could be distinguished and quantified. Labeled cell lysates were combined in equal proportions, RIG-I complexes were purified over a STREP-tactin affinity column and eluted proteins were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.

Among those were known RIG-I interactors like 14-3-3\u03b5 and ubiquitin indicating the validity of our approach [41,42]. Still, we considered that candidate proteins need to be carefully evaluated to count as bona fide RIG-I ligands as several factors including the overexpression of the RIG-I bait or the highly dynamic association of RIG-I with partially insoluble complexes could have influenced the outcome of the experiments. Among the identified proteins we focused our further analysis on DDX6 since, like RIG-I, it belongs to the DExD/H box RNA helicases. This family comprises many proteins involved in mRNA metabolism, and several of its members in addition to the well-established RIG-I-like helicases RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 have been recently shown to be involved in antiviral immunity.",

HeLa cells transfected with Flag-RIG-I and GFP-DDX6 were mock treated or infected either with the wild type or mutant #4 virus unable to silence PKR activation. In non-infected cells, DDX6 presented a diffuse staining throughout the cytosol similar to RIG-I and was, in addition, detected in a punctate pattern (Figure 1b). Cells infected with the wild type virus presented a similar staining as the non-infected cells. Interestingly, in mutant #4 virus infected cells, RIG-I and DDX6 colocalized in larger dot-like structures (Figure 1b) in addition to a diffuse staining throughout the cytosol. Since mutant #4 virus is unable to inhibit PKR, we hypothesized that the dot-like cytosolic structures corresponded to SGs. In fact, only cells subjected to heat shock [43] or infected with the mutant #4 virus harbored large cytosolic granules containing the SG marker protein G3BP (Figure 2a), indicating that mutant #4 virus induces SGs. While only 3% (5/152) of mock cells and 4% (5/117) of wt-infected cells displayed a granular G3BP pattern, 59% (65/110) of mutant #4-infected cells were SG positive. To verify the expectation that RIG-I and DDX6 also accumulate in SGs, we infected transfected HeLa cells with the mutant #4 virus. The infected cells presented SGs in which G3BP colocalized with RIG-I (Figure 2b) as well as with DDX6 (Figure 2c). These results show that RIG-I and DDX6 presented a diffuse distribution throughout the cytosol in wild type virus infected cells and colocalized in SGs, when cells were infected with the mutant influenza B virus. Based on the phenotype of the NS1 mutant virus, these findings also establish that the NS1 protein of influenza B virus has a conserved capacity to control SG formation, although it shares less than 25% sequence identity with IAV orthologues [33,44].",

Cells infected with the wild type virus did not upregulate IFN-\u03b2 on the transcript and cytokine levels, as expected [40] (Figure 3e,h). RIG-I knockdown reduced the production of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in response to NS1 mutant virus infection by up to 90%, whereas knockdown of DDX6 decreased IFN-\u03b2 mRNA production by about 50\u201360% (Figure 3f,g). Measurement of IFN-\u03b2 concentrations in the supernatant of infected DDX6 knockdown cells by ELISA revealed corresponding reductions in cytokine secretion (Figure 3j). Taken together, these findings corroborate a novel role for DDX6 as an enhancer of RIG-I signaling. Moreover, they are suggestive for a SG-independent mechanism of DDX6 since its influence on RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction was also observed in wild type and NS1 1\u2013104 virus-infected cells that both did not show enhanced SG formation.",

In non-infected cells, only the isolated CARD domains (mutant b) and the \u0394CTD construct (mutant e) were able to efficiently pulldown DDX6, whereas the full-length RIG-I protein showed only very weak binding (Figure 4b). In contrast, in mutant NS1 1\u2013104-infected cells, in addition to the CARD and \u0394CTD domains, also the full-length RIG-I protein was able to associate with DDX6 (Figure 4c). The lack of the regulatory CTD in mutants b and e is expected to expose the CARD domains and allow binding to DDX6 in the absence of infection [7]. In contrast, for the wt RIG-I protein (construct a), an infection with a virus defective in RIG-I inhibition is required to induce release of the CARD domains from its intramolecular sequestration. Thus, in this assay system, wt RIG-I only binds DDX6 in cells infected with NS1 1\u2013104 virus.

In an attempt to gain a better understanding of the mechanism underlying DDX6-mediated enhancement of RIG-I activation, we tested whether DDX6 was also able to bind IV RNA. To this end, cells transfected with GFP-tagged DDX6 were mock-treated or infected with wild type virus. GFP-tagged IRF3 was used as a negative control, since IRF3 is not known to bind RNA. Proteins were harvested from cell lysates by GFP affinity purification and RNA was isolated from these complexes by proteinase K digestion and column purification. The eluted RNAs were first examined by qRT-PCR showing that DDX6 bound comparable amounts of cellular actin mRNA irrespective of infection indicating that similar RNA quantities were present in the different settings (Figure 4d). Interestingly, we found that DDX6 also captured substantial amounts of viral RNA from virus infected cells, while IRF3 did not (Figure 4e). We then hypothesized that the DDX6-associated viral RNA might activate RIG-I. To test this, RNA eluted from DDX6 or IRF3 as shown in Figure 4d and e, was re-transfected into 293T cells and evaluated for RIG-I-dependent IFN-\u03b2 promoter induction. Significantly, DDX6-bound RNA from infected cells specifically stimulated RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4f), demonstrating that DDX6 binds viral RNA that has the capacity to stimulate RIG-I.",

            "text": "The current study aimed at a better understanding of the regulation of RIG-I activation, a central player in the cellular innate response against IV. Here, we identified the RNA helicase DDX6 as a novel interaction partner of RIG-I. The association of RIG-I with SGs and their role in the induction of an antiviral response has been established [35,48]. DDX6 is a well-known component of SGs, but apart from that has a pleiotropic role in the metabolism, distribution and storage of RNA in the cell [45,49]. Consistently, our coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified an interaction between RIG-I and DDX6 also in the absence of SGs. Further, our data argue against an RNA-bridged interaction of RIG-I and DDX6, since DDX6 directly binds to the RIG-I CARD domains. This binding pattern suggests a preference of DDX6 to bind to activated RIG-I, in which the CARD domains are released from intramolecular sequestration [50] and become available for protein-protein interactions. Also, several of DDX6\u2032 established properties could enable it particularly well to serve as an auxiliary factor for RIG-I. DDX6 is constitutively expressed in cells at high concentrations (estimated 2 \u00d7 106 DDX6 proteins per HeLa cell) and it binds RNA sequence-independently with nanomolar affinity [51]. DDX6 represses mRNA translation by binding mRNAs and storing them in P-bodies. Since DDX6 has the capacity to unwind secondary structures in RNA [51,52], it is tempting to speculate that it can collect the viral RNA and present it in suitable topology to RIG-I to induce its activation. This would also match to the recently reported activity of RIG-I not only as a sensor but also as an active disruptor of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes [53,54,55]. In the future, it will be important to untangle the interplay of DDX6 and mRNP granules in the initiation of antiviral responses. Of note, a similar role was identified for the P-body component LSm14A, which underscores the importance of mRNP granules as initiator sites of the host antiviral response [56]. Also in line with these findings, influenza A virus disrupts P-bodies during the course of infection [34], illustrating the complex interplay of cellular responses and viral countermeasures. DDX6 was recently shown to limit expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) via an MDA5-dependent mechanism [57]. Thus, DDX6 might work as a buffer, supporting IFN induction via RIG-I and at the same time limiting detrimental effects of aberrant ISG expression.",
