The rational design of RNA sequences that can specifically block the expression of selected genes responsible for various diseases, including cancer, viral infection and genetic disease, has received major attention in recent years. The research in this area has been fuelled by the idea that selective and specific inhibition of tumour growth with minimal side effects on normal cells can be achieved using RNA. The simplicity of RNA engineering combined with its versatility in structure and function has highlighted the use of nucleic acid- and RNA-based strategies for therapy. Next, we list several RNA-based therapeutic approaches.",

RNAi exists in several forms, two of which siRNA [34] and miRNA (see section titled \u2018Aptamers\u2019) are discussed in this article. The use of RNAi technology for functional genomics has been highlighted by systematic RNAi-based genetic screening in C. elegance and Drosophila\n[34], [35]. Baulcombe and Hamilton found that cells can control protein production by a novel mechanism through which small double-stranded RNA molecules bind to specific mRNA sequences and block the respective gene's protein expression [34], [35], [36]. Furthermore, additional aspects of RNAi have been recognised over the past 7 years. In 2001, Elbashir et al. demonstrated that RNAi can be mediated by 21-nt siRNAs in cultured mammalian cells [37], [38]. Then, Andrew Z Fire and Craig C Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel prize for physiology or medicine for their fundamental work in RNAi and its therapeutic potential [39].",

ShRNA is transcribed under the control of RNA Pol-II or Pol-III promoters and folds into a structure resembling a siRNA duplex. ShRNAs are then processed by Dicer into siRNAs. Alternatively, chemically synthesised siRNA duplexes, mimicking the structure of Dicer-processed products, are commonly used in research for gene silencing.

However, to design a therapeutic siRNA only requires knowledge of the target gene's sequence. Moreover, the fact that siRNA-mediated RNAi mechanism takes place in the cytoplasm is a potential advantage over other gene-regulation mechanisms that require penetrating the nucleus [34]. Theoretically, RNAi can silence the expression of mRNA for any gene, including growth factors, viral genes, oncogenes, anti-apoptotic genes (e.g., survivin) and genes that were once deemed \u2018non-druggable\u2019 [40] by small molecule inhibitors. Consequently, not only is siRNA-mediated RNAi a useful biological tool for assessing gene function, but also equally important is siRNA's therapeutic potential [41].",

            "text": "Aptamers are a family of RNA- or DNA-based oligonucleotides of 20\u201350 nt in length that can specifically bind to selected targets. They may be generated by in vitro screening via Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) [42], [43]. Utilising a library containing random RNA sequences with about 1014\u201317 varieties, in vitro binding, elution and reverse PCR amplification techniques allows for the selection of RNA molecules that efficiently bind to a specific receptor or ligand with high affinity [42], [44]. The approach is based on the folding ability of RNAs into complex structures, reflecting the diversity of RNA functions [43], [45], [46], [47]. A natural adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding aptamer with structure similar to the ATP-binding aptamer by SELEX was also reported in the pRNA of bacterial virus phi29 DNA packaging motor [48]. Aptamers have been selected to bind proteins, organic compounds, small molecules and nucleic acids with K\nD's in the \u03bcM or nM range [42], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53]. Aptamer-binding occurs with high specificity through the formation of strong binding pockets analogous to antigen\u2013antibody interaction. SELEX allows screening for co-variation of several nucleotides and can be used to reveal non-canonical interaction, which is difficult to prove by classic genetic and biochemical approaches. For therapeutic purposes, aptamers can be used to bind and inhibit harmful molecules or serve as targeting ligands for nanomedical constructs [54]. RNA aptamers, transcribed or synthesised, simplify the need for chemical conjugation or mixing with other moieties. Aptamers have been used as ligands for specific delivery of siRNA to prostate cancer cells [55] and lymphocytes [54], [56], [57].",

MiRNAs are first transcribed in the nucleus as parts of long primary miRNA transcripts (referred to pri-miRNA) with 5\u2032- caps and 3\u2032- polyA tails. Pri-miRNAs with hairpin structures are then processed into pre-miRNAs by the ribonuclease Drosha. The pre-miRNAs are subsequently transported out of the nucleus to cytoplasm by Expotin-5, and processed to mature miRNAs by Dicer. Similar to siRNA-mediated silencing pathway, miRNA is then loaded into RISC. However, its mode of action is dependent on the extent of sequence complementarity between the miRNA and the target mRNA. When an miRNA matches the sequence of the mRNA completely, the miRNA/RISC complex mediates the cleavage of the mRNA using the same mechanism as siRNA. For miRNAs that only partially match the mRNA's sequence, the miRNA/RISC complex induces translational inhibition and subsequent mRNA degradation. Endogenous miRNAs with partial sequence complementarity to their target mRNA commonly target the 3\u2032- untranslated region of their target mRNAs.",

Several siRNA therapeutics already are in clinical trials for targets that are superficial organs (e.g., the eye), where the therapeutic agent can be directly injected into the organ [64]. SiRNA therapeutic studies currently in clinical trials include age-related macular degeneration, respiratory infections, chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and other types of cancer. However, this strategy is not feasible for deeper tissues, which demand vectors that can be delivered systemically (e.g., intravenous injection). The human body is well equipped with special functions to destroy foreign RNA present either in the bloodstream or in the tissues and prevent the dsRNA from entering the cells. The aim for in vivo delivery is to provide specific cells with therapeutic concentration of siRNAs for the length of time required for the inhibition of gene expression. Consequently, the ability to deliver therapeutic siRNA to specific ailing cells, and its stability in the extracellular and intracellular environments after systemic administration, are some of the most challenging aspects in the advancement of siRNA therapeutics.",

LNA is a nucleotide derivative which links the 2\u2032- and 4\u2032positions of the sugar with an \u2013O-CH2- bridge [77]. In addition, 2\u2032-NH2, 2\u2032O-(2-methoxyethyl) and 4\u2032-thio are also tested as alternative approaches. In contrast to most other 2\u2032- modifications, which can be incorporated only through chemical synthesis, 2\u2032-F can be incorporated through in vivo transcription. Long dsRNAs with all pyrimidines replaced with 2\u2032F-nucleotides retain the ability to be processed by recombinant human Dicer into short siRNA duplexes. In an in vivo study, 2\u2032-F-pyrimidines-siRNA duplexes inhibited the target gene expression in mice and, as expected, exhibited a prolonged half-life in plasma as compared to non-modified siRNAs [62]. However, this prolonged half-life did not translate into increased potency in animals, presumably because of unfavourable pharmacokinetic features. Modification with 2\u2032-O-methyl on the entire siRNA abolished its activity, while modification on only the sense strand did not. Currently, 2\u2032-O-methyl modification at the terminal regions of the sense strand is commonly used for commercially available siRNA duplexes. In addition, 2\u2032-O-methyl substitution at position 2\u2032- in the guide strand reduced silencing of most off-target transcripts that contain complementary sequences to the seed region in the guide strand [78], [79].",

One might assume that siRNA must be protected from nucleases both in serum and in the cytoplasm, but cytoplasmic stability is unclear.

The average size of a single siRNA molecule is well below 10 nm. In addition, the polyanionic nature of RNA makes it difficult for it to penetrate the cell membrane and non-formulated siRNAs have been reported to be easily excreted by the body [91], [92], [93]. Therefore, these molecules, even if stabilised, are subject to renal filtration when administered into the bloodstream. SiRNAs would suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and be limited in the extent and duration of their effect. To increase the size, siRNA can be transcribed as a longer piece or chemically linked (i.e., by disulfide bonds, streptavadin/biotin, etc.) to other nucleic acids, proteins and surfaces to form larger particles [94]. Another approach, achieving both increased particle size and enhanced stability in the extracellular and intracellular environments, involves extranucleotide materials. Polymers and liposomes, which together with siRNA form nanoparticles, can increase the size and protect siRNA from nuclease degradation. These nanoparticles are formed by conjugating biologically inert polymers directly to siRNA or by preparing liposomes that envelop siRNA molecules. Both types of nanoparticles have proven successful in stabilising siRNA in serum.",

It is commonly accepted that the size of a nanoparticle is paramount for effective delivery to diseased tissues. Many authors suggest that particles ranging from 10\u2013100 nm [95], [96], [97] or as large as 200 nm [98], are the optimal size for a non-viral vector because they are large enough to be retained by the body yet small enough to access the cell surface receptors and pass through the cell membrane by receptor-mediated endocytosis [96]. However, nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm are recognised by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). The RES is made up of mononuclear phagocytes that originate in the bone marrow and mature in the bloodstream. As the monocytes mature, they begin to localise outside the bloodstream in or near a number of tissues including lymph nodes, liver, lung, digestive track and spleen, transforming into fully mature macrophages. Macrophages recognise , internalise and degrade large particles through a process called opsonisation. Opsonisation is the process by which opsonins, originating from mature macrophages, coat foreign substances like bacteria or nanoparticles. The coating drives the binding and ingestion of the foreign substances by macrophages. This process is largely responsible for the short half-life of nanoparticles larger than 100 nm and must be taken into account when designing nanoparticles for siRNA delivery. While they avoid recognition by the RES, nanoparticles with a diameter less than approximately 5 nm are subjected to renal filtration. The kidneys, largely responsible for the whole body homeostasis, efficiently remove waste and other matter from the body. However, size limits of globular filtration preclude large molecules from being subject to this process. Specific challenges associated with the use of nanoparticles as systemic drug delivery vehicles continue to be stabilisation of the particles, increased circulation time and targeted delivery.",

The nanoparticle size and surface charge play a key role not only in the half-life of the nanoparticle but also in governing which tissues accumulate relatively high concentrations of nanoparticles. One of the driving forces behind this theory is that the barriers protecting tissues vary in porosity, both in pore size and number. In particular, some tumour tissues are surrounded by rapidly growing and/or disorganised vasculature that is not supported by efficient lymphatic drainage. Nanoparticles are able to extravasate and accumulate in the \u2018leaky\u2019 vasculature of these tumours. This phenomenon is called the \u2018enhanced permeability and retention\u2019 (EPR) effect [103], [104], [105].

Oftentimes, the genetic abnormality dictates the malignant behaviour of tumours, allowing for unrestrictive cell proliferation, invasion of adjacent tissues, metastasis from the primary tumour site, formation of new blood vessels and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Cancer gene therapy aims to correct these genetic abnormalities by suppressing pathological genes or re-expressing functional tumour suppressor genes. The potential of siRNA for cancer therapy was recognised early, as it can hypothetically regulate the expression of cancer cells while leaving normal genes unperturbed. In addition, the gene-silencing efficiency of an equivalent dose of siRNA has been proven higher than antisense oligonucleotide and ribozyme strategies, which were initially popular for their abilities for suppressing gene expression for the purpose of cancer gene therapy [107], [108]. One important factor for successful RNAi-based cancer therapy is to choose the right target genes. Great efforts have been made to identify molecular targets in cancer therapy.

SiRNA-based therapeutics can induce apoptosis of cancer cells by targeting anti-apoptotic factors, such as Bcl-2, survivin and Akt1. Suppression of those anti-apoptotic genes by siRNAs was found to induce apoptosis in various cancers or sensitise them to chemotherapy drugs [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115].

In addition, siRNA against Bcr-Abl significantly increased the sensitivity of CML cells to the treatment of anti-CML drugs.

            "text": "SiRNA offers the opportunity to treat viral infection by suppressing viral transcripts in host cells. Viruses of different families have been inhibited by siRNA with high efficiency, including RNA , reverse-transcribing and DNA viruses. Many of these viruses pose major threats to human health, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, polio virus, influenza virus and herpes simplex virus. It has been suggested that RNAi can be applied to inhibit replication of every class of virus since the transcription of mRNA is a critical step needed for the replication of all viruses [125]. Both viral and host genes that are essential for viral replication have been used as targets of siRNA-based viral therapy to suppress the replication. Silencing of viral genes involved in the early events of the viral life cycle, such as binding to cellular receptors, entry and the transcription and translation of early genes, is considered to be more effective than silencing of late genes. An initial study performed by P Sharp's group [126] used siRNA to inhibit HIV replication in vitro. In a HeLa-derived cell line expressing CD4 and other co-receptors of HIV, siRNA against CD4 or the viral gene gag resulted in inhibited viral production following HIV infection [126]. Since mutant strains of HIV emerge constantly, highly conserved sequences in essential genes such as gag, pol, int and vpu are often chosen to be targeted [127]. However, targeting those highly conserved sequences may not translate directly into effective gene-silencing, as only a few suppressed gene expression effectively when a panel of siRNAs were tested. In another study of influenza virus, siRNAs were designed against several conserved regions of the viral genome including NP, PA, PB1, PB2, M or NS genes. Two siRNA against nucleocapsid and RNA transcriptase were much more effective than the others [128]. Therefore, the actual inhibition efficiency of each rationally designed siRNA still needs be verified by experiments. Another strategy to deal with potential viral genome mutation is the use of cocktail siRNA, which is a combination of siRNAs targeting one or several essential genes of the virus [129], [130]. Cocktails with different siRNAs targeting the same mRNA target can also be used to combat viral genes that undergo frequent mutations. The downside of the cocktail approach is the potential difficulty in pinpointing any siRNAs that induce the interferon response or off-target effects. Targeting host genes by RNAi is also effective in the prevention and treatment of virus infection. Knocking down the expression of CD4, CCR5 or CXCR4 by siRNA effectively inhibited the entry and replication of HIV [126], [131]. However, silencing host receptors with critical biological functions, such as CD4, may result in unacceptable side effects. Targeted delivery of siRNA to viral-infected cells then becomes an essential supplement to this approach. For example, siRNA conjugated to an anti-gp160 antibody was delivered specifically to a mouse melanoma cell line stably expressing HIV gp160, which mimics the antigen presented by HIV-infected cells [56], [106], [132].",

The rationale for using nucleic acid-based vectors stems from the fact that (1) construction of the vector may be simpler compared to other lipoplex or polyplex strategies; (2) without complexing to proteins, nucleic acids have not been reported to elicit an antibody response; (3) nucleic acids are within the nanometre regime and can construct larger structures via bottom-up assembly in a controlled manner; and (4) molecules can be conjugated directly to the ends of nucleic acid strands to add additional functionality. Reports have shown that, when designed correctly, nucleic acid-based constructs such as phi29 pRNA/siRNA chimera are still able to be processed by Dicer into functional siRNAs [29], [54], [99]. Reiterating two of the criteria for a successful non-viral siRNA vector, nucleic acid-based vectors must be of adequate size and, for RNA-based vectors, stable against RNAse nucleases. Undoubtedly, if nucleic acid-based vectors are to be used, they must incorporate RNase-resistant nucleotide analogues if they are to be successful in vivo.",

The construct featured both an siRNA domain as well as an RNA aptamer targeting prostate cancer cells [55]. Zhang et al.

A single-stranded folate\u2013DNA strand with a complementary 15 nt sequence was synthesised separately and annealed to the overhang [88]. The rationale was that the folate moiety would facilitate targeted delivery to folate-receptor positive tumour cells. Once internalised, RNaseH, which degrades DNA:RNA hybrid strands, would degrade the hybrid portion of the vector, liberating the siRNA strand to participate in silencing. Although the authors did not show data that the vector was being processed as hypothesised, the authors reported \u223c 80% relative mRNA knockdown in HUVECs in a folate-targeted, sequence-specific manner.

Three daily intravenous injections of a therapeutically viable dose (3 mg kg\u20131) of SNALP\u2013siRNA reduced HBV levels significantly. The reduction of HBV lasted up to 6 weeks [149]. Another study showed that SNALP\u2013siRNA rapidly silenced apoB gene in the liver of cynomolgus monkeys at a dose of 1\u20132.5 mg kg-1, resulting in a 65% reduction of serum cholesterol [150]. In addition, the silencing effect was found to last for 11 days after the RNA treatment. The size of SNALPs likely plays a significant role in their limited biodistribution. Morrissey et al. showed that SNALPs generally accumulate in the liver and spleen and did not deliver significant amounts of RNA to other tissues [149]. More so, SNALP\u2013siRNA delivery is generally well tolerated; evaluation of its toxicity reveals only a transient increase in liver enzyme activity [149], [150].",

Low\u2013molecular-weight PEI has been shown to effectively condense RNA and protect them from nucleases in a cell-free RNase digestion assay using 1% serum [154]. An additional benefit is that PEI exhibits a proton sponge effect and water swells the endosomes. As the amine groups on, the polymer buffers the lower pH of the endosome, subsequently rupturing the endosomal membrane and allowing more siRNA to escape the complex into the cytoplasm. Urban-Klein et al. found that PEI-complexed siRNA showed protection from degradation after 4 h in vivo, whereas uncomplexed siRNA was completely degraded within 15 min [154]. In another study, the PEI\u2013siRNA complex was delivered through intravenous administration to prevent and treat influenza virus replication in mice [155]. It was found that PEI\u2013siRNA was distributed to multiple organs but delivered to the lung preferentially after intravenous (IV) injection. However, whether the lung preference is due to the trapping of the polymer\u2013siRNA complex or by lung macrophage remains to be investigated. The trapping of bronched nanoparticles by lung macrophages and liver Kuffer cells is one of the current challenges in siRNA delivery.",

CDPs, 50\u2013150 nm in diamater, are composed of cationic polymers with funnel-shaped cyclodextrin molecules integrated into the polymer strand. The cationic polymer complexes with the siRNA and the cyclodextrins serve as adapter molecules, where different functionalised adamantane molecules can be \u2018plugged\u2019 into the CDP. The functionalised adamantane molecules give CDPs additional functionality. As the individual components of CDPs were known to be relatively non-toxic, they were designed specifically as highly non-toxic and non-viral vectors. In vivo studies include CDPs delivered to non-human primates and CDPs containing siRNA against the cancerous EWS\u2013FLI1 fusion gene product. For the EWS\u2013FLI1 study, both short- and long-term administration of CDP\u2013siRNA decreased implanted tumour volume [158]. The authors claim that CDP protects RNA from serum, so modified nucleotides are not required. As an application of CDP functionalisation, they were functionalised with adamantane\u2013transferrin and adamantane\u2013PEG conjugates. The resulting PEGylated and transferrin-targeted CDPs delivered siRNA in animals at dosages that are likely to be amenable to therapeutic use in humans. Perhaps the most astonishing characteristic of this approach is that the resulting siRNA complex, even when siRNA containing an immune stimulatory sequence is included, does not produce immune stimulation like that seen with other siRNA\u2013lipid complexes. Generally, 2\u2032-modified siRNA must be used to abrogate such a response.",

A recent study has demonstrated their ability to target hepatocytes via an N-acetylgalactosamine (NAG)-driven targeting mechanism [161]. Dynamic polyconjugates were engineered so that all functional groups of the vector are stable at pH 7, but degrade once in the acidic environment of the endosome. Once internalised into endosomes, the endosome is disrupted via an endosomolytic agent and the siRNA is released into the cytoplasm. This could prove advantageous when developing siRNA complexes with unique biodistribution profiles. One drawback to the approach is that the chemistry necessary to synthesise the dynamic polyconjugates is more involved than other vector preparation.",

Monoclonal antibodies against oncogenes such as HER2 or VEGF have been well developed and widely used for cancer treatments in clinics. In attempts to create a trivalent particle, a recent study by Tan et al. [183] conjugated a HER2 antibody to a chitosan\u2013siRNA\u2013quantum dot nanoparticle. The results showed that the trivalent particle significantly silenced GFP. Instead of using the transferrin molecule directly, Pirollo et al. conjugated a single-chain monoclonal antibody fragment (scFv) targeted to the transferrin receptor to nanoimmunolipoplexes containing fluorescent siRNAs. These targeted nanoimmunolipoplexes showed a dramatic increase in targeting to primary and metastatic tumours compared to untargeted siRNA treatment. In addition, whereas systemically delivered nanoparticles commonly accumulate in the liver, the study showed that no considerable amount of siRNA was detected in the liver [184]. In a study performed by Lieberman's group [185], the heavy chain Fab fragment of an antibody against HIV-1 envelope protein was fused with nucleic acid-condensing protein protamine (Ab-protamine) to serve as a delivery vehicle. The antibody:protamine:siRNA construct targeted against the HIV gag gene effectively suppressed target gene expression and inhibited HIV replication in hard-to-transfect primary T cells infected with HIV. In addition, intravenous injection of the same antibody:protamine:siRNA complex in a mouse model led to substantial suppression of the growth of HIV envelope-expressing melanoma. In the same study, a fusion protein containing the single-chain antibody against HER2 receptor was also able to deliver siRNA specifically to HER2-positive breast cancer cells. These studies represent major landmarks in the successful design and in vivo delivery of antibody-targeted therapeutic siRNA particles. Following this approach, another study constructed an antibody-targeted cationic liposome to deliver siRNA against cyclin D to treat inflammatory bowel disease [164]. One drawback to these peptide-based targeting moieties is the induction of antibody response [185], which would abolish long-term dosing schedules unless a humanised antibody be utilised.",

Currently, the major challenge in ligand-based delivery is the short of useful specific cell receptors for targeting. In addition, many cell receptors will simply not internalise cargoes after the ligands interact with the receptors. Receptor-binding RNA aptamers may prove successful in this area. As mentioned in Section 2C, aptamers bind to small molecules (i.e., metabolites, proteins, cell surface receptor, etc.) with high affinity and specificity comparable to antigen\u2013antibody interactions. Applications of aptamers in siRNA vectors include the use of CD4 aptamer targeted to lymphocytes [11] and PSMA aptamer targeted to prostate cancer membrane antigen, a signature surface molecule of prostate cancer (Guo S and Guo P, unpublished results) [55], [186]. In the work by McNamara et al. [55], RNA aptamers were linked to siRNA to form an RNA chimera by in vitro transcription and annealing. Systemic administration of this construct specifically inhibited tumour growth in a xenograft model of prostate cancer in mice. In contrast to the system used by Guo et al. (see section titled \u2018Targeted delivery using phi29 pRNA nanocarriers\u2019), McNamara et al. could not transcribe their entire construct in one piece; the antisense strand of the siRNA was synthesised commercially and annealed to the sense strand separately. McNamara's approaches, however, allowed the incorporation of imaging nucleotides into the construct. It was shown that PSMA\u2013siRNA was internalised by PSMA-positive cells and the treatment reduced xenograph tumour volume. In a similar study, prostate cancer-specific delivery of siRNA was observed when it was coupled to the PSMA aptamer via a streptavidin bridge.",

The ability to easily functionalise pRNA multimers for target-specific localisation and the feasibility of multiple therapeutic agents delivery using a single vehicle are other significant advantages of the pRNA approach. Each hexameric pRNA nanoparticle offers six positions available to carry molecules for cell recognition, therapy and/or detection. A variety of other molecules such as heavy metals, quantum dots, fluorescent beads or radio-isotopes can also be conjugated for detection via imaging of cancer signatures at different developmental stages. Therapeutic efficacy could be improved by conjugating pRNA to endosmolytic chemicals which can trigger the release of the internalised therapeutic reagents from the endosome.

The hammerhead ribozyme was targeting the HBV polyA signal. The chimeric ribozyme, flanked and processed by two cis-cleaving ribozymes was able to fold correctly while escorted by the pRNA and cleave the polyA signal of HBV mRNA in vitro almost completely. Inhibition of HBV replication by the pRNA-escorted ribozyme was more efficient than in the absence of pRNA as shown by Northern blot and Hepatitis B e-antigen assays in cell culture studies. pRNA could also carry another hammerhead ribozyme to inhibit a different gene thus making targeting of multiple genes possible.",

The assembly mechanism of dimeric or trimeric pRNA nanoparticles is based on interlocking loop interactions between pRNA subunits. The bases involved in these interactions were identified as 45\u201348 and 82\u201385 of wild-type pRNA in the left- and right-hand loops, respectively. The sequence in the left-hand loop is represented by a capital letter, while the sequence in the right-hand loop is represented by a lowercase letter and apostrophe. The left-hand loop of one monomer pairs with the right-hand loop in another monomer, and vice versa. In some cases, only two G-C pairs between the interacting loops were sufficient to allow the formation of pRNA dimers. However, a minimum of three base pairs were needed for pRNAs tertiary interactions. When four nucleotides were paired, at least one G-C pair was required. The maximum number of base pairs required to form pRNA multimers was five. Base-pairing can be used to control the multiplicity of the pRNA nanoparticle and the assembly of hetero- or homo-multimeric structures. Rational design of the interlocking base-pairs allows the formation of hetero- or homo- dimers and trimers. For example, a pRNA monomer with a loop sequence of Aa\u2032 can form a homo-dimer with itself. Meanwhile, Ab\u2032 cannot do that for a homo-dimer. However, an Ab\u2032 monomer incubated with a Ba\u2032 monomer can dimerise to form an Ab\u2032/Ba\u2032 heterodimer.

Dimeric or trimeric pRNA was formed simply by mixing individual chimeric pRNAs with their complementary partners with appropriate interlocking loops. Our group has designed a trimeric pRNA nanoparticle harbouring three individual functional subunits: (1) an RNA aptamer or other receptor-binding ligand, which specifically binds to a cell-surface receptor, (2) a therapeutic agent such as siRNA, ribozymes, antisense RNA or other drugs to be delivered and (3) a reporter molecule such as fluorescent tag. Thus, the pRNA-based vectors enable the simultaneous application of siRNA and aptamers against specific receptors, while tracking the delivery via the fluorescent marker. This allows the use of a single cargo carrier for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents with confirmation of delivery. Our previous studies demonstrated that incubation of pRNA vectors containing a receptor-binding aptamer and a therapeutic siRNA resulted in binding and co-entry of the nanoparticles into cells, subsequently modulating the apoptosis of cancer cells in leukaemia model lymphocytes.

DsRNA can be sensed in cytoplasmic and endosomal compartments by RNA-dependent kinases (PKR) [192]. The activation of PKR induces interferon (IFN) responses, leading to global inhibition of protein synthesis by phosphorylation of elF-2a, and production of proinflammatory cytokines by activating NF-kappa-B. Besides PKR, recent studies showed that dsRNA within the cytoplasm can also be sensed by the helicase retinoid-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), which may also contribute to the activation of NF-kappa-B and the production of IFN. RIG-I is an intracellular pathogen-recognition receptor. A variety of viruses are recognised by RIG-I which then triggers the innate antiviral response independent of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent pathways. MDA-5 gene is induced during differentiation, cancer reversion and cell apoptosis. In the past, only long dsRNAs (> 30 bp) have been considered to induce interferon responses. However, more studies have found that both, chemically synthesised siRNAs and those generated from in vitro transcription with various lengths, can lead to the activation of PKR, and the longer the length of the dsRNA, the stronger is the effect on the host cells. A study performed by Rossi's group reported that a 5\u2032 triphosphate on T7 polymerase-transcribed RNA molecules is a potent inducer of IFN response [193].",

A variety of TLRs are expressed on immune cells to identify non-self patterns from pathogens. Among them, TLR7 and TLR8 recognise viral or synthetic single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) containing GU-rich sequences. TLR3 is believed to recognise dsRNA and polyI-polyC sequences. Recognition of RNA by TLRs activates cellular-signalling pathways that lead to the activation of NF-kB and production of proinflammatory cytokines. In a very recent study it was shown that siRNA against VEGF in the eye can trigger TLR3 on the cell surface. VEGF is a pro-angiogenic factor that is involved in age-related macular degeneration. Although the intended effect (i.e., decreased blood vessel growth) was observed, the effect was seen regardless of the sequence; for example, siRNA-targeting luciferase also showed reduced vessel growth [194]. The silencing was attributed to sequence-independent triggering of TLR3 and subsequent cytotoxicity. Therefore, TLRs represent another important component of siRNA-mediated immune response. To avoid or reduce unfavourable immune responses, siRNAs need to be optimised to avoid GU-rich sequences or other patterns that may trigger TLR responses [195]. Optimising the length and/or reducing the dosing of siRNA may also help to alleviate IFN responses. Finally, experimental screening of multiple siRNAs against the same target is required to identify a candidate with minimal immune responses.",

On the other hand, sequence-dependent off-target effects come from the presence of a sequence in the siRNA that partially matches an mRNA sequence of non-target genes in the host. The existence of such homologous sequences will lead to the cleavage of the non-targeted mRNA or inhibition of its translation in a similar fashion to the action of miRNA. Using bioinformatics, careful comparison of the sequences of siRNA with the host genome will be necessary to exclude a possible match of sequences. A recent study has found that 2\u2032-O-methyl modification at the position 2 in the guide-strand of siRNA can reduce off-target silencing of most transcripts that are complementary to the seed region in the siRNA guide strand [196].
