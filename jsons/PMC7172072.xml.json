            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections are amongst the most frequent infectious illnesses afflicting both adults and children, and result in a surprisingly diverse range of disease severity from the mild common cold to severe life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections. Whilst careful studies undertaken in the 1960s identified many of the viruses responsible for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs),1 it was only with the advent of sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques that it was determined which viruses were responsible for the majority of URTIs and the viruses identified in population studies.2, 3 Human rhinoviruses (RVs) have consistently been found to be the most frequent cause of URTIs (30\u201350% of cases), followed by coronaviruses (10\u201315%), with parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and enteroviruses in 5% of cases or less.1, 2 Influenza virus causes 5\u201315% of viral respiratory infections and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 5\u201310%; these two viruses appear to have the capacity to cause more serious disease (see below).1 Recently, human metapneumovirus has been identified as a pathogen in humans and is thought to account for up to 6% of all URTIs in young children.4 Despite the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 20\u201330% of URTIs a pathogen cannot be identified. A more recent advance in viral diagnostics is the application of DNA microarray technology, which allows researchers to assess individuals with URTIs for all known viruses.5 Using this technology in a community study of adults, RVs were still found to predominate, but a much greater diversity in both RVs and coronaviruses was found to cause disease than had been anticipated.6\n",

This phenomenon occurs through a complex interaction of host susceptibility, including previous recognition by the adaptive immune response, and viral virulence.13 Even limited endobronchial infection with influenza leads to extensive damage to the epithelium.14 Of all the viruses, influenza appears the best able to avoid the innate immune response in the airways with the potential consequence of severe respiratory symptoms and systemic inflammation.",

Viral triggers to acute exacerbation of asthma were also seen to have a direct impact on the airway inflammation in acute asthma, leading to a specific neutrophil infiltrate, with elevated levels of IL-8 which correlated with acute disease severity.18 These findings demonstrate that activation of the innate immune response to virus infection in asthma influences airway inflammation and clinical disease severity directly.",

When pDCs harvested from the bone marrow of LMCV-infected mice were cultured for 4 days there was a transformation of pDCs into mDCs. This was dependent on viral replication and was seen by a downregulation of pDC markers and the development of the mDC phenotype; an increase in cell size and granularity, and myeloid marker expression.62 This transformed population of mDCs also switched functional states, achieving a heightened antigen-presenting capacity, an enhanced ability to stimulate na\u00efve T cells and the ability to signal through TLR-4.62\n",

This initial activation was mediated by RNA helicases with AM localized to the lungs and cDCs migrating to regional lymph nodes and producing IFNs. However, when AMs were depleted there was a marked defect in viral elimination evident and an IFN response. It was then seen that pDCs became GFP positive and localized to the lung interstitium, producing a delayed yet quantitatively similar IFN response via TLR-3 activation. Infection was then repeated with Sendai virus which has been used to model respiratory virus infection in mice and, like influenza virus, inhibits RNA helicases. A similar response was again seen with the activation of the alternate pDC response.",

Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) are classically part of the adaptive immunity. This requires the development of a cohort of CD8 cells that recognize specific viral epitopes and infected cells, and selectively target them for elimination. Whilst this is a highly effective and specific system, it requires time to mount an effective adaptive response. Recent evidence now suggests that proliferating memory CD8+ lymphocytes activated for other reasons can provide an early source of IFN-\u03b3 acting in a non-specific bystander role.67, 68 This early source of IFN-\u03b3 comes from CD44highCD8+ lymphocytes through mechanisms which are independent of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and cannot be generated by na\u00efve T cells.69, 70 It was shown that CD8 effector cells from mice could be activated by LPS via TLR-4 and by PolyI:C via TLR-3, leading to the release of IFN-\u03b3 without a specific TCR-mediated response.70 Evidence suggests this innate activation is highly influenced by cytokines secreted by APCs; DCs, macrophages and epithelial cells. When these cells release IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, an antiviral response is stimulated, whilst IL-15 assists in the development of memory phenotype of CD8+ lymphocytes.69, 70, 71, 72, 73 In fact, IL-15 enhances IL-12 and IL-18\u2019s ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 and increases the sensitivity of CD8+ lymphocytes to stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines.73\n",

Thus, T lymphocytes are both negative regulators of early innate responses to infection and non-specific IFN-\u03b3 releasing cells, and without these roles the adaptive components of immunity would never be able to be performed.",

The fact that most of these viruses are efficiently eliminated with minimal airway inflammation and damage reflects the effectiveness of a system that can quickly recognize invading viruses and initiate an appropriate response. The detection by PRR initiates an effective antiviral response characterized by type 1 interferons. This response begins with the epithelium acting both as a barrier and sentinel for the innate response and interacts with both macrophages and DCs. This response in itself can eliminate infection, but also leads to the recruitment of an effective adaptive immune response, whilst the presence of adaptive T cells acts as an important safety valve to limit inflammation associated with the innate response.",

            "text": "Figure 1: RNA helicases, retinoic-acid-inducible protein (RIG)-I and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene (MDA)-5 detect viral replication in the cytosol. RIG-I detects negative-sense RNA from DNA viruses and MDA-5 detects positive-sense RNA from RNA viruses. RIG-I and MDA-5 signal through interferon response factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7 to induce interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB, leading to the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators. TLR-3 is expressed in intracellular endosomes and responds to the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which forms as a product of the replication of the majority of RNA viruses. TLR-3 is dependent on binding with the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor (TRIF). This leads to phosphorylation of IRF-3 which forms a homodimer and translocates to the nucleus, resulting in the expression of IFN-\u03b2. Signalling can also occur that leads to the translocation of NF-\u03baB. TLR-4 is expressed on the surface of cells and recognizes bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide and the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). TLR-4 is able to signal via both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways and is able to activate a response via IRF-3, NF-\u03baB and activating protein (AP)-1. TLR-7 is found within endosomes and is activated by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). TLR-9 is also found within endosomes and is activated by unmethylated CpG dsRNA. Both TLR-7 and -9 signal through a MyD88-dependent pathway, leading to the translocation of NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and IRF-7, and the latter is responsible for release of IFN-\u03b1. The IFNs mediate their effects through the induction of hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), the actions of many of which remain unknown. Induction of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b14 occurs early after virus infection and is regulated by phosphorylation of IRF-3. The other IFN-\u03b1 genes require synthesis of IRF-7 to lead to their activation and this occurs as a more delayed response requiring a positive feedback signal via the early release of IFN-\u03b2/\u03b14 to lead to the full induction of ISGs. Release of type 1 IFNs can be recognized by infected and neighbouring cells and type 1 IFNs exert their actions through specific receptors (IFN receptor-\u03b11/\u03b12). Receptor engagement leads to activation of the IFN stimulated regulatory factor (ISGF)-3 comprised of members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 and -2, as well as IRF-9. This complex can directly bind in the nucleus to the IFN stimulated response element, leading to transcription of type 1 IFNs as well as ISGs, especially the antiviral proteins: protein kinase receptor (PKR), RNAse-I and 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2032\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase, and myxovirus resistance proteins (MxA).",
