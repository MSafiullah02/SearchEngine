Although mobile phone locations provide some information about community-level activity, dense distributed geophysical sensing of ground motions across a city are more complete and also natively anonymous. In this paper, we demonstrate how fiber-optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) connected to a telecommunication cable beneath Palo Alto, CA captured seismic and geodetic signals produced by vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and subsequent quarantine. We utilize DAS strain measurements of roadbed deformation caused by local cars and trucks in an automatic template matching detection algorithm to count the number of vehicles traveling per day over a two-month period around the timing of the San Francisco Bay Area shelter-in-place order. Using a segment of the optical fiber near a major grocery store on Sand Hill Road we find a 50% decrease in vehicle count immediately following the order, but data from near Stanford Hospital showed a far more subtle change due to on-going hospital activities. We compare the information derived from DAS measurements to other quarantine response metrics and find a strong correlation with the relative changes reported by Google and Apple using mobile phone data.",

Monitoring activity levels during early stages of a pandemic can provide scope of contact tracing and containment efforts. During quarantine, quantifying public activity feeds-back the required information to public health and government officials to make informed decisions such as if the population is properly following quarantine orders (Wesolowski et al., 2012 , Tizzoni et al., 2014 , Oliver et al., 2020 . Historically, this information has been captured in the months or years following the crisis through in-person surveys, but in the past decade public and private mobile phone data has become a tool to understand where, when and how phases of a particular crisis are unfolding in real time. During the COVID-19 crisis, Apple and Google released Mobility Reports beginning April 4, which aggregated mobile phone location services data from individual users into regional statistics about public infrastructure usage (Apple, 2020; Google, 2020). In the San Francisco Bay Area, these reports signaled that vehicle traffic and in-store purchases dropped by 60 -80% in the days following the shelter-in-place order, while grocery and pharmacy visits decreased by 20%. Although valuable, the utility of mobile phone data is limited in many different ways. For example, the data analyzed are only collected from the subset of people who have access This preprint was submitted to Science Advances on 10-May-2020.",

Such energy could be produced by vehicles traveling anywhere within a radius of several hundred meters. In Figure 4 , we show that the DAS data from Sand Hill Road documents a relationship between the number of vehicles and the total surface wave strain energy recorded in two different high frequency bands In times of crisis, access to DAS-derived information about public infrastructure utilization is valuable to public health and government officials because it provides city-wide measurements which are natively anonymized and aggregated with the requisite level of spatial and temporal granularity to make decisions. DAS retrieves data about how infrastructure is being used across a large urban area with an easily deployable instrument. power of the seismic trace. We used a 0.01-s duration STA window and a 10-s duration LTA window, and automatically determined the detection threshold such that about 200 templates were detected per day. These settings were validated against human picks for short segments and it was determined that the STA/LTA algorithm accurately detected the higher amplitude vehicle signals.",

            "text": "Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is an emerging geophysical method that turns optical fibers into dense seismic recording arrays with virtual receiver points spaced every 1 -10 m along the fiber. A DAS experiment consists of connecting an optoelectronic DAS instrument to one end of a standard telecommunications-grade optical fiber. The DAS instrument sends short laser pulses into the optical fiber and measures the subtle phase shifts of Rayleigh scattered light returning to the detector at a predicted two-way travel time (Posey et al., 2000; Masoudi and Newsom, 2016).In this way, the strain field acting on the fiber coupled to the Earth can be sampled at a meter-scale spatial resolution over tens of linear fiber kilometers. Recently, it was shown that DAS can takeadvantage of otherwise dark telecommunication fibers (Martin et al., 2017; Jousset et al., 2018; Ajo-Franklin et al., 2019), or even be used in combination with lit fiber networks (Wellbrock et al., 2019), effectively leveraging portions of the used or unused modern utility grid for geophysical sensing. In the dark fiber case, DAS recordings commonly capture 10,000 -20,000 horizontal fiber-oriented components of the strain field in a time continuous fashion, a scale of seismicThis preprint was submitted to Science Advances on 10-May-2020.Science AdvancesManuscript Template Page 6 of 21 acquisition that is not possible with traditional seismometers. An additional advantage for dark fiber DAS is that the instruments are deployed in secure telecommunications utility buildings and the fiber is secure under the road. Therefore, this type of experiment can be rapidly deployed in a few hours and continue to record for years without major operations costs. In urban areas, DASmeasurements have already been used for near surface geological imaging (Dou et al., 2016, Martin, 2018, Spica et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2020) and earthquake recording (Lindsey et al., 2017, Martins et al., 2019). In this paper, we use continuous dark fiber DAS recordings from a telecommunication cable running through Palo Alto, CA, leased from Stanford University IT Services to measure how different public sectors of the city responded to the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine order. We begin by illustrating the diversity of urban soundscapes and the related challenges of disentangling urban ground noise source processes. Then, we show how the broadband nature of DAS buried beside roads in a city captures both high frequency (3 -30 Hz) anthropogenic surface waves radiated by vehicles as well as a more interpretable geodetic signal of the response of the roadbed to vehicle loading which occurs in a lower frequency range (< 1 Hz). We use the geodetic signals to automatically detect individual vehicles and measure their speed, size, and direction on the road. We compare the number of vehicles passing through portions of the public infrastructure around Palo Alto recorded by DAS to the Google and Apple Mobility Reports and discuss the complementarity of this anonymous geophysical data source. Results Exploratory Data Analysis: Over 14.5 TB of continuous DAS strain data were recorded between 01-Mar-2020 through 01-May-2020 on the Palo Alto DAS array (see map in Figure 1a). The general characteristics of the local urban seismic background were documented for a subset of DAS channels near Stanford Hospital and Sand Hill Road by computing daily power spectral This preprint was submitted to Science Advances on 10by broad frequency maxima spanning half an octave or more (Figure 1b), but the exact frequency peak varied significantly across the array, even within 100 m. Peak amplitudes from Sand Hill Road were 20 -30 dB higher than on the non-Sand Hill Road segment. Some channels, like from Upper Sand Hill, also showed minor, narrow frequency peaks. Significant PSD reductions of up to 7 dB were observed at most channels beginning after the first week in March (black traces) to the last day (solid color; transparency decreases with time) in Figure 2b (analyzed in greater detail below). Other channels, including those near Stanford Hospital, showed only one lower frequency peak that did not systematically change during quarantine.Combining DAS density with multi-kilometer lateral apertures permitted more targeted exploration of the sources responsible for the urban seismic background.

The data in this figure are pre-processed strain time series recorded during a three-minute period from 10-Mar-2020 using the evenly-spaced DAS array, and then bandpass filtered between 3 -30 Hz. In this high frequency band, ground motion could be tracked coherently 100 -200 m away from the vehicle, but longer wavelengths likely travel much further. The reduced seismic background at non-Sand Hill Road DAS channels was observed to transition sharply from high to low at X=3.18 km where the fiber turned off of Sand Hill Road towards Stanford Hospital (seeFig. 1a), potentially related to fiber directionality, distance from the road, and coupling.Filtering the Palo Alto DAS data in a lower frequency range of 0.1 -1 Hz revealed a localized wavelet pattern with peak amplitudes around 5 -10 nanostrain, which migrate in time and space at the speed limit for the road (Figure 2b).

In general, vehicular seismic sources can be modeled using a collection of vertical point forces located at the vehicle's wheel-road contacts (Ben Zion & Zhu, 2002; Li et al., 2018, Jousset et al., 2018; Brenguier et al., 2019).

The measured horizontal displacement ( ! ) is linearly related to the vehicle's mass, and falls off rapidly as 1/r 2 unlike the higher frequency surface wave ground motions which radiate hundreds of meters beyond the vehicle's location. The point load horizontal strain response ( ! ) described in(2), which is equivalent to the change in (1) divided by the gauge length (i.e., spatial derivative of displacement), thus depends only on the vehicle's speed and Poisson's ratio. However, the strain response to a four-wheeled passenger vehicle, for example, also depends on the inter-wheel separation or vehicle area. Based on a plausible parameter space, we determined that urban vehicles produce geodetic signals with energy around 0.1 -1 Hz (see Materials and Methods).Vehicle Detection and Characterization: Vehicle-induced geodetic strains in the range 0.1 -1 Hz were utilized in a template-matching algorithm to detect and characterize changes in Palo Alto vehicle traffic patterns during the COVID-19 quarantine (Figure 2d, see Materials and",

This is equal to a 40 -60 % decrease in the measured number of vehicles relative to a background level which we calculate from the median of the first week of the experiment (01-Mar-2020 through 07-Mar-2020, inclusive). Reduced traffic levels persisted through quarantine without increasing. Meanwhile, the number of vehicles detected using DAS data near Stanford Hospital documented a stable level of vehicles around 2,000 vehicles per day in the two-week period after the order. Beginning around 06-Apr-2020, the vehicle activity near Stanford Hospital steadily declined to around 80% of the pre-quarantine level most likely as a result of the closure of the Stanford clinics as well as Stanford Hospital instructing hospital staff to change where they parked their vehicles. Additionally, the dramatic modification of traffic patterns in Palo Alto could have rerouted drivers to a faster route avoiding this part of the city. There were several anomalous times of vehicle activity such as on 17-Apr-2020 (Good Friday) and 25-Apr-2020 when it appears more vehicles were traveling in this area potentially to spend time outdoors on Stanford University's campus or surrounding parks.

            "text": "The Stanford DAS-2 experiment, which used an OptaSense ODH-3 interrogator connected to a telecommunication fiber running from Stanford University campus to near the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), began recording on 10-Dec-2019 and at the time of this paper is still recording. The ODH-3 records optical phase shift (proportional to strain) per gauge length. The sampling rate was 250 samples per second. The gauge length was 20 m. There were, in total, 1250 channels with a channel spacing of 8.16 m. About 350 channels were located along the relatively straight Sandhill Road section between the quiet portion of the array near Stanford Hospital (Channel #300) and SLAC (Channel #750). The data volume write rate to-date is approximately 108 GB/day. DAS data processing: Unless otherwise specified, DAS data processing involved the following procedure: 1) load raw SEG-Y data in multi-hour continuous time series, 2) convert from optical phase to strain based on photonic parameters (amounting to multiplication by This preprint was submitted to Science Advances on 10the common mode noise by subtracting a contemporaneous time series recorded by an isolated channel from DAS array. Often, we isolated a particular seismic signal by then bandpass filtering the data. Unless otherwise specific, the bandpass filter applied was a fourcorner, zerophase, Butterworth-Bandpass filter. PSD strain values for DAS recordings werecomputed as 10 )3 ( ! 2 ) and thus have units of nanostrain 2 /Hz or dB/Hz. RMS strain values for DAS records were obtained by taking the square-root of the integral of the power spectrum computed for a 30-minute window of data according to Parseval's theorem. In Figure 4, we sum 30-minute RMS values to obtain a total strain. Model of roadbed deformation due to vehicle loading: Small passenger vehicles, light trucks, and larger vehicles (1000 -3000 kg) traveling at city speeds of 10 -20 m/s (22 -45 mph) produce quasi-static/geodetic signals with energy around 0.1 -1 Hz on roadside fibers that are buried on the order of 1 m below the surface and located at a distance of less than 20 m from where vehicles are located on the road. To compute the modeled synthetic horizontal strain signal shown in Figure 2, we assumed a fiber depth of 2 m, a lateral offset of 10 m, vehicles speeds between 10 and 15 m/s, vehicle mass between 1000 -3000 kg, and appropriate values for sandy/clayey soils, such as a Poisson's Ratio of 0.4, a Young's modulus of 80 MPa, and a shear modulus of 28.6 MPa. Vehicle detection algorithm: To determine the number of vehicles driving in different sectors of Palo Alto we analyzed strain recordings from individual DAS channels using a templatematching detection algorithm based on the characteristic geodetic signal described in the main text and modeled in Figure 2d. We used a different template for each channel and day. The 20-second duration template was constructed from a median of 200 SLA/LTA detections. STA/LTA refers to an earthquake detection algorithm in which the ratio of a short-term average (STA) of a timeseries over a long-term average (LTA) is employed to detect signal impulses rising above the background noise with a threshold. Classically, the STA/LTA algorithm is computed over the This preprint was submitted to Science Advances on 10-May-2020. Science Advances Manuscript Template Page 13 of 21",
