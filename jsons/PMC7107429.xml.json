The sample preparation method and the chromatographic and mass spectrometry conditions were as described in a previous work [9, 11] and elsewhere in this article (Supplementary Materials). Briefly, the metabolic profile of the urine was acquired using a Waters Acquity Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography system coupled to a Waters Q-TOF Synapt G2 mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). The diluted samples were separated by a C18 column (Acquity HSS T3; dimensions, 2.1 mm \u00d7 100 mm; pore diameter, 1.7 \u00b5m; Waters). The electrospray source was operated in positive and negative ionization modes with a capillary voltages of 3 kV and 1.5 kV, respectively. Data were collected in centroid mode, with a mass scan range of 20\u20131200 m/z and a resolution of 20000. All operations were controlled with MassLynx 4.1 (Waters). Quality control samples and standard solution samples were used to test for reproducibility and accuracy during the analysis and were injected at regular intervals throughout the sequence, together with blank samples (water and 0.1% formic acid). The samples were randomly injected in triplicate to prevent any spurious classification deriving from the position of the samples in the sequence.",

Specifically, exploratory data analysis was performed using principal component analysis (PCA), and projection to latent structures discriminant analysis based on variable influence on projection selection (VIP-based PLS-DA) [12] was used to identify differences between the groups under investigation. Multivariate projection methods linearly combine the measured variables to obtain the components (known as latent variables) that provide a data representation where the effects of the factors included in the experimental design can be easily investigated. Because, in our untargeted approach, most of the measured variables are not relevant for the aim of the study, variable selection was used to improve model robustness, and a procedure called stability selection was implemented to simplify model interpretation. In this procedure, stability selection [13] based on Monte Carlo sampling (200 random subsamples) was used to pinpoint the subset of relevant variables characterizing the groups being investigated. The relevant variables were those selected in >50% of the submodels generated during the stability selection procedure. Moreover, the group of samples excluded during Monte-Carlo sampling has been used to estimate the predictive power of the models. Seven-fold full cross-validation was used to determine the number of components to use, whereas permutation analysis of the class response was used to avoid overfitting. Each PLS-DA model was characterized by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) in fitting the training data, during cross-validation, and in predicting the samples excluded during stability selection (AUCpred).",

How this cycle may influence the pathophysiology of respiratory tract diseases is not clear, but its alteration may be a sign of disrupted cellular energy metabolism, reflecting a condition of stress and increased anaerobic glycolysis [33]. This could explain why inflammatory conditions such as asthma are characterized by such metabolic alterations [29].

Short-chain fatty acids are derived from bacterial fermentation and are therefore profoundly influenced by gut microbiota. A recent case-control study also identified a specific fecal microbiota profile associated with a higher likelihood of developing bronchiolitis [35]. The emergence of different fatty acid metabolites in children with and those without recurrent wheezing suggests that a different composition of the gut microbiota might be associated with the onset of this condition.
