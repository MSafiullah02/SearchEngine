While many countries in SSA have instituted screening measures, the focus has been at the ports of entry, with screening targeted at people with a recent travel history to outbreak areas abroad. However, screening travelers for fever has been shown to be largely ineffective, 8 because it is unable to detect people who are in their incubation phase (which could exceed 12 days for COVID-19). 9 Thus, many cases within communities are likely being missed, and the possibility for widespread infections in SSA could be imminent, mindful of the fact that unlike EVD which required very close contact for transmission, being a viral respiratory disease, COVID-19 has a higher transmission potential.",

The government of Ghana, for example, recently announced a US $100 million fund to cover the expansion of infrastructure, purchase of materials and equipment, and public education. 19 The United Nations has also released US $15 million to help the world's most vulnerable countries fight the outbreak. 20 However, these funds are meager compared to the US where Congress recently approved US $8.3 billion 21 or in Australia where $AUD 2.4 billion has been outlined by the federal government to fight the same outbreak. 22 The WHO and its partners have recently launched a Solidarity Response Fund to support country-level efforts. 23 Regardless, any response within SSA must consider the potential economic consequences for the residents many of whom are informal (self-employed) petty traders and whose businesses are already being adversely impacted due to COVID-19-related restrictions.",

            "text": "For example, Mato and colleagues, 15 reported that in 2009, there were just eight ICU beds for port Harcourt and its environs in Nigeria, an area with an estimated population of more than 9 million people. A 2015 survey of 21 hospitals in Kenya by Okech et al 16 also found that there were only 130 ICU beds and 204 specialized intensive care nurses, and in Namibia, just 18 ICU beds were present across more than 350 public facilities nationwide in 2019. 17 Thus, governments in SSA need to have clear strategies about how they would deal with COVID-19 patients needing hospitalization or critical care to avoid disrupting the entire health system which could further increase deaths from other non-COVID-19 causes as was noted during the EVD outbreak.Moreover, given the high out-of-pocket expenditure in this region-a critical barrier to accessing health care, 18 governments need to outline and inform the public how COVID-19-related care is being funded. Importantly, it would be essential for COVID-19-related services such as testing, and treatment be provided free to all citizens and these services should ideally be made available nationwide and not only in urban areas so as to improve reporting at health care facilities which could help curb further community transmissions.",
