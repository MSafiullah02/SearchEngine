However, the detailed catalytic mechanism of coronavirus 3CL Pro remains largely unknown. We took an integrated approach of employing X-ray crystallography, mutational studies, enzyme kinetics study, and inhibitors to gain insights into the mechanism. Such experimental work is supplemented by computational studies, including the prereaction state analysis, the ab initio calculation of the critical catalytic step, and the molecular dynamic simulation of the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Taken together, such studies allowed us to identify a residue pair (Glu-His) and a conserved His as critical for binding; a conserved GSCGS motif as important for the start of catalysis, a partial negative charge cluster (PNCC) formed by Arg-Tyr-Asp as essential for catalysis, and a conserved water molecule mediating the remote interaction between PNCC and catalytic dyad. The data collected and our insights into the detailed mechanism have allowed us to achieve a good understanding of the difference in catalytic efficiency between 3CL Pro from SARS and MERS, conduct mutational studies to improve the catalytic activity by 8-fold, optimize existing inhibitors to improve the potency by 4-fold, and identify a potential allosteric site for inhibitor design. All such results reinforce each other to support the overall catalytic mechanism proposed herein.",

For substrate binding, the protease adopted a residue pair (Glu-His) and a stable hydrogen bond formed by a conserved His and the substrate Gln to recognize the conserved Gln in the P1 position of the substrate. For catalysis, a conserved GSCGS motif was identified and shown to stabilize the active site of the substrate and maintain the mobility of the catalytic cysteine side chain.

The distinctions between proteases from SARS and MERS were explored in terms of their catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, mutation studies were conducted to improve the enzymatic activity (8-fold), the inhibitor of MERS-CoV 3CL Pro was optimized to improve the potency via introduction of a powerful hydrogen bond interaction between the inhibitor and the critical Q195 of MERS-CoV 3CL Pro .

Basically, the first step of nucleophilic reaction was assumed to be critical in the cascaded mechanism. 40, 41 Accordingly, the two complexations of peptide substrate and the protease were constructed for MERS-CoV Wild type (exp.

Water molecules were assigned with the TIP3P model, and the ff14SB force field was applied for the classical molecular dynamics simulation. The complexes were placed in a truncated octahedral box of water molecules, extending 10.0 \u00c5 along each dimension. A certain number of counterions Na + were added to neutralize the calculated system. The MD systems were first minimized by the steepest descent minimization of 1000 steps followed the conjugate gradient minimization of 9000 steps, heated up from 0 to 300 K at constant volume in 50 ps, and equilibrated for another 50 ps without any restraints. In the MD simulations, the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was employed for long-range electrostatic interactions. Finally, multiple 10 ns of trajectories (100 000 frames) were collected for the further PRS analysis, similar to our previous studies. 42 \u221244 Ab Initio Calculations. For each reaction system, a snapshot that was close to the average simulated structure was extracted from the stable MD trajectory as the starting structure for the ab initio calculations.

Within stable MD trajectories, we obtained an average D1 value and chose the snapshot with the D1 value being close to the corresponding average D1 value. Each system was truncated as a model (Scheme S3) to mimic the reaction pathway in the protein environment. During the geometry optimization, the boundary atoms were fixed at the position they were in in the protein environment.

With the aim of understanding the molecular catalytic pattern of MERS-CoV 3CL Pro and SARS-CoV 3CL Pro , it is important to examine the experimentally determined structure of the protease with a bound ligand. For MERS-CoV 3CL Pro , we started with a reported complex structure (PDB code: 4RSP) for further investigation. To check the catalytic mechanism and unravel the general coronavirus 3CL Pro catalytic mechanism, we sought to determine the complex structure of SARS-CoV 3CL Pro with a peptidomimetic aldehyde inhibitor (PDB code: 6LNQ; for detailed information, see Table 1 ). Generally, MERS-CoV 3CL Pro and SARS-CoV 3CL Pro appear as a quasi-ellipsoid and possess three separate portions (domain I, domain II, and domain III), which are connected by flexible loops (Figure 2A ). More narrowly, the structures of the two proteases chiefly comprise 10 helices, \u03b11\u2212\u03b110, and 13 \u03b2-sheets, \u03b21\u2212\u03b213 ( Figure  S2 ). Therein, domains I and II are reported to execute catalytic activity, while domain III is responsible for protease dimerization. 49 By superimposing the two structures, the rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) value indicated that the catalytic zone (domain I and domain II) presented higher similarity than the dimerization domain (domain III) ( Figure  2A ). In addition, similar results emerged among four other coronavirus 3CL Pro proteins (human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), bat coronavirus HKU4 (BCoV-HKU4), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)), which hinted that various coronaviruses 3CL Pro have a conserved proteolysis mechanism ( Figure S3 ).",

In MERS-CoV 3CL Pro , two cysteines (C145 and C148) are located in the catalytic center ( Figure 2D ), whereas SARS-CoV 3CL Pro exploits only C145 to execute catalysis. Nevertheless, C148 has been reported to be essential to the protease, although the significance of C145 in MERS-CoV 3CL Pro is still unknown. To examine the influence of C145 in MERS-CoV 3CL Pro , we mutated both Cys to Ser and Ala. Enzymatic assays using the purified variants C145S and C145A showed that these mutations manifested comparable efficiency to WT MERS-CoV 3CL Pro , while the variants C148S and C148A almost eliminated the catalytic efficiency ( Figure 2D ).

However, the inextricable interaction between H175 and E169 made it reasonable to speculate that H175 was indispensable for proteolytic bioactivity ( Figure 3C ). Subsequently, crippling the impregnable interactions by replacing H175 with Ala, Leu, Glu, and even Asn could remarkably reduce the enzymatic activity, though the mutation of H175 to Gln, which shared a similar hydrogen bond donor feature to His, could retain the protease bioactivity ( Figure 3D ). The results indicated that the hydrogen bond interaction between H175 and E169 was essential to the protease, which was in contrast to the previous E169L mutant result ( Figure 3B ). Then, a multipoint mutant (E169L/H175L) was created, and this mutant expressed inferior catalytic activity ( Figure 3D ). To explain these unexpected results, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were applied to imitate the binding mode of the protease with the natural substrate, which was construed form the peptidomimetic aldehyde structure and optimized by MD simulation.

Due to the essential fitting model of E169-H175, it led us to question whether a residue with a suitable side chain volume might act similar role with Gln to fill the S1 pocket and start the cleavage event. However, coronavirus 3CL Pro preferred Gln to His, which exhibits a similar side chain volume as Gln in the substrate P1 (G) The model to explain the underlying reason for the restraining effect of G149A toward the free rotation of the C148 thiol. The left part is the time evolution of the \u03c6 dihedral (148C-149N-149CA-149C) in the WT and G149A mutant proteases. Following mutagenesis of G149 to A149, the distinction in the \u03c6 dihedral between the WT and G149A mutant proteases led to more compact binding between C148-G149 and H166, which hampered the rotation of the C148 side chain in the G149A mutant (right). site, invalidating this assumption. To explore the underlying reason, the structures of the two proteases were scrutinized, and a conserved histidine (H166 in MERS-CoV 3CL Pro and H164 in SARS-CoV 3CL Pro ) caught our attention, as it formed robust hydrogen bond interactions with the inhibitor ( Figure 4A ). In an effort to validate the effect of the robust hydrogen, mutagenesis study on H166 of MERS-CoV 3CL Pro was performed. Mutants H166A and H166L could reduce the proteolytic activity, which clearly demonstrated the significance of the intense hydrogen bond ( Figure 4B ). As Gln and Asn have similar hydrogen bond donor and acceptor abilities as His, both of them were suitable replacements for histidine. But mutants H166N and H166Q had significantly decreased activity, implying that other characteristics might define the conserved histidine ( Figure 4B ). After examining the structures, due to the inappropriate dihedral (CD2-CG-CB-H) presented by H166, conserved H166 exhibited an eclipsed conformation, leading to the torsional tension and a rotating trend ( Figure 4C ). Thus, there were restrictive ingredients that limited the rotation of the H166 side chain and maintained H166 in its energized conformation, which made H166 interact with the substrate Gln in an appropriate angle and distance.",

On the basis of the alignment of the common coronavirus 3CL Pro sequence, a conserved GSCGS sequence caught our attention ( Figure 5A ). As a familiar protein linker, the GS sequence was frequently applied for protein engineering. However, the GS sequence, especially a double GS sequence, infrequently emerges near the viral cysteine protease catalytic center. Therefore, to verify the significance of the motif, the residues in the GSCGS motif of MERS-CoV 3CL Pro were sequentially replaced with Ala and all of the mutants represented reduced activities, which manifested that the GSCGS motif was essential for protease activity (Figures 5B and S11) . Further exploring the structure of the protease, the GSCGS motif exhibited three consecutive turns via obvious hydrogen bonding ( Figure 6A ). As Pro is an appropriate residue to form a turn in the protein structure, the mutation of Gly to Pro was performed. The decreased bioactivity of variants G146P and G149P indicated the irreplaceability of the GSCGS motif and the significant role of Gly in the GSCGS motif ( Figure  5B ).",

In parallel, the PMF calculation result for WT protease manifested two low energy conformations appearing in the trajectory of the protease. However, the results of variants G149A and G149P suggested that only one low energy conformation, where the thiol was far from the active site of the substrate, emerged in the motion of the protease ( Figure S14 ) and manifested the rotation of C148 side chain relied on G149. To unveil the underlying reason, the rotation of the C148 thiol in the WT protease was further investigated and two typical states (resting state and attacking state) were noticed in the MD simulations ( Figure  S15 ). In the resting state, the C148 thiol preferred to deviate from the substrate and interact with H166. Conversely, the C148 thiol presented a suitable conformation, close to the substrate in the attacking state. By superimposing the attacking and resting state conformations, the C148-G149 main chain exhibited obvious deflection, while the dihedral \u03c6 and \u03c8 angles of C148 were stable (Figures S16 and S17 ). This result indicated that the translation of the C148-G149 main chain other than rotation might contribute to the rotation of the C148 thiol. In the G149A mutant, the smaller A149 \u03c6 dihedral led to a compact conformation of A149 and enhanced the rigid hydrogen bond between A149 and H166, which indicated that the translation of the C148-A149 main chain would demand more energy to break the restriction of H166 to A149 in the G149A mutant ( Figure  5D and 5G). Additionally, due to the deficiency of the hydrogen bond interaction in G149P, the C148 thiol formed a more robust interaction with H166 in compensation, interfering with the rotation of the C148 thiol ( Figure S18 ).",

With the development of the catalysis, bearing an analogous chymotrypsin-like structure of 3CL Pro , the EV71 3C protease cuts the polyprotein precursors with its catalytic triad (Glu, His, and Cys) ( Figure  S19 ). Nevertheless, there is a catalytic dyad (His and Cys) in coronavirus 3CL Pro due to the Glu deficiency. After aligning the six coronavirus 3CL Pro sequences ( Figure S20 ), the conserved acidic amino acid D190 caught our attention. Interestingly, D190 is located almost 6.7 \u00c5 away from H41, which seemed problematic for promoting firm interaction between D190 and the catalytic dyad due to the long distance ( Figure 7A ). To discover the significance of D190, D190 was mutated to Leu, Ala, His, and Asn. As a result, the D190A, D190L, D190H, and D190N mutants failed to effectively cleave the substrate, while the D190E mutant retained protease catalytic activity, which implied that the acidic residue was indispensable, despite the far distance from the catalytic dyad ( Figure 7B ).",

Following mutagenesis of R40, the catalytic activity of mutants exhibited a remarkable decline ( Figure 7B ). Interestingly, when R40 was mutated to an aliphatic residue (Leu or Ala), the density of the D190 negative charge would be enhanced and the proteolytic activity might in theory be improved. However, the mutants R40L and R40A manifested decreased proteolytic activity. Therefore, a partial negative charge cluster constituted from R40-D190 was supposed to play a significant role in the catalysis activity. Meanwhile, the value of the positive charge of the Arg side chain was usually superior to the value of the negative charge manifested by Asp side chain in physical condition. This implied the existence of an extra residue that could alleviate the positive charge of R40 for maintaining the partial negative charge of R40-D190. Investigation of the structures of the two proteases showed that Y54 and M85 were located near R40 and might interact with R40 via a \u03c0-cation interaction and an electron atmosphere\u2212cation interaction, respectively ( Figure 7C ). Following mutagenesis of Y54 and M85, the results suggested that Y54, rather than M85, could interact with R40 via the \u03c0\u2212 cation interaction, which potentially supported that Y54 could interact with R40 via the \u03c0-cation interaction to alleviate the electrical interference of R40 to D190 and further caused D190 to present partial negative charge ( Figure 7D ). Additionally, multipoint mutations were introduced, and the loss of catalytic activities of the variants reiterated the importance of the partial negative charge cluster (PNCC) constituted by D190-R40-Y54 ( Figure 7D ).",

However, the investigation of the structures of the two proteases identified a conserved water, which might mediate the remote interaction between these two essential components ( Figure 8A ). To verify the necessity of the conserved water, MD simulations were employed to imitate the motion of the conserved water that was extracted from its original location in MERS-CoV 3CL Pro .

As a consequence, biochemical results and POVME calculation results suggested that the volume and hydrophilicity of the pocket created by H41, Q167, M168, and D190 were critical to the catalytic activity of protease ( Figure 8D ). With further investigation, the lower catalytic activity emerged in the variants (Q167S, Q167N, and Q167H) with hydrophilic side chains at 167 th residue, which additionally proved that the long hydrophilic side chain of Q167 anchored the conserved water in the suitable location.

Figure 8E showed the accessibility of the Gln-Ser peptide bond of the substrate to the Cys148 thiolate of the MERS-CoV 3CL Pro . It is highly essential for the nucleophilic thiolate and the acceptor carbonyl group to align up in the sp2-sp3 conversion to maximize the orbital interaction between the peptide \u03c0* (LUMO) and sulfur lone pair (HOMO) in the nucleophilic addition. 54 Using the Burgi\u2212Dunitz criteria of near-attach-conformation parameters (the S---C distance <3.5 \u00c5 and attacking angle alpha (100\u2212110\u00b0) and SCOCa dihedral (85\u221295\u00b0)), the calculated PRS indicated a significant population belong to the resting state, where the S\u2212C distance is as long as \u223c4.8 \u00c5.

Therefore, we chose an attacking state conformation on the basis of the criteria described at methods and performed ab initio calculation. Compared with the state excluding the remote interaction, the integral state presented a lower catalytic energy barrier, which suggested that the existence of the remote interaction could extremely accelerate the first step of the nucleophilic reaction ( Figure  8E ).

Meanwhile, the MD simulations results indicated the violent swing of Q167 emerged in mutants S178A and T88A, while stable Q167 appeared in mutant S178T/T88C (Figures S23 and  S24 ). These results verified the similar environment of MERS-CoV 3CL Pro Q167 and SARS-CoV 3CL Pro H164, and suggested that the key residue to anchor the conserved water rather than the environment might be the main ingredient to cause the distinction of two proteases. Therefore, on the basis of the elimination of environmental impacts, a multipoint mutant (T88C/Q167H/S178T) of MERS-CoV 3CL Pro was created.

Moreover, in the MD simulations on the catalytic process (H41 formed protonated histidine-HIP and C148 became thiolate following an abstract proton processing of H41), a typical conformation of the conserved water approaching M168 was captured ( Figure 11A) .

The enhanced enzymatic activity proved the validity of the mutagenesis strategy, and the underlying mechanism was shown to restrict the motion of the conserved water in compact area via MD simulation, which further proved the temporary stabilizing effect of PNCC via the conserved water ( Figures 11B, 11C , and S25).
