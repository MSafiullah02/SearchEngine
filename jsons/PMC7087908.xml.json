            "text": "During the past decade, the interaction of metal complexes including ruthenium Ru(II) complexes with DNA has attracted much attention, and the use of these complexes as probes of DNA structure and sites has proven to be quite fruitful [1\u20135]. Some new theoretical calculations and technologies, such as density functional theory method, picosecond time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, and femtosecond linear dichroism, have been widely used to study the strength, geometries, and modes of Ru(II) complexes binding to DNA [6\u201313]. In general, Ru(II) complexes bind with DNA in a non-covalent interaction fashion, such as electrostatic binding for cations, groove binding for large ligands [14], intercalative binding for planar ligands, and partial intercalative binding for incompletely planar ligands [15, 16]. On the other hand, a considerable amount of new information for RNA\u2013metal complex interactions has also emerged. Metal complexes are usually used as catalysts of RNA hydrolysis cleavage [17], shape-selective probes of RNA tertiary structure [18], agents of RNA oxidation cleavage [19], and recognition of mismatches in RNA [20]. Also, the binding mode and enantioselectivity for the interaction of a Ru(II) complex with yeast tRNA has been investigated by spectroscopic methods [21], and the anti-HIV activity and enantiomeric diversity of eilatin Ru(II) complexes binding to RNA [22, 23] have been reported.",

One of the questions is that how the structures of nucleic acids affect the binding behaviors of metal complexes. It is well known that yeast tRNA is different from calf thymus DNA (CT DNA) not only in composition of bases, but also in structure. CT DNA is B-form configuration, while yeast tRNA has an A-form configuration with a L-shaped tertiary structure. Therefore, a comparative study of the interactions of Ru(II) complexes with yeast tRNA and CT DNA in binding mode, binding strength, driving force, and enantioselectivity will be really important for understanding the mechanism of the interactions and the biological impact of Ru(II) complexes.",

Yeast tRNA and CT DNA were dissolved in the corresponding buffer before use with appropriate concentration to be stored at 4\u00b0C, and used not more than 1 and 2 days, respectively. Solutions of yeast tRNA and CT DNA gave ratios of UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm of over 2.0 and 1.8\u20131.9 respectively, indicating that both nucleic acids were fully free of protein [36]. The concentrations of yeast tRNA and CT DNA solutions were determined at 260 nm by absorption spectroscopy using molar absorption coefficients of 7,700 M\u22121 cm\u22121 for yeast tRNA [37] and 6,600 M\u22121 cm\u22121 for CT DNA [38].

A titration experiment consisted of 28 consecutive injections of 10-\u00b5l volume and 20-s duration each, with a 5-min interval between injections. Heats of dilution of the complex were determined by injecting the complex solution into the buffer alone and the total observed heats of binding were corrected for the heat of dilution.

For yeast tRNA binding of the complex, the fluorescence intensity of the complex decreased gradually upon the addition of yeast tRNA (3a). The hypochromism of the peak reached as high as 24.9% with a blue shift of 8.0 nm at a molar ratio of yeast tRNA to the complex of 3.0. The change in emission for yeast tRNA titration was smaller compared with that for CT DNA. The inset of 3a shows a Stern\u2013Volmer plot of the quenching of fluorescence of the Ru(II) complex by yeast tRNA, where F\n0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of yeast tRNA. As shown in the inset of  3a, at higher yeast tRNA concentrations, the quenching curve bended downward obviously and went up slowly, reaching a comparatively saturated situation at the molar ratio of yeast tRNA to the complex of about 3.0. In contrast, for CT DNA binding of the complex, the fluorescence intensity of the complex increased with the increase of CT DNA concentration, reaching a maximum at a molar ratio of CT DNA to the complex of 20, at which there is a 1.8-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity of the complex compared with that in the absence of CT DNA ( 3b).

Data were presented as (\u03b7/\u03b70)1/3 versus the molar ratio of the Ru(II) complex to CT DNA [46], where \u03b7 and \u03b70 are the viscosities of CT DNA in the presence and absence of the complex respectively. As shown in  5, with the increase of the concentration of the complex, the relative viscosity of CT DNA increased steadily. On the other hand, no obvious change in flow time was observed for yeast tRNA in the presence of the complex.\n",

The titration curves displayed that both the bindings of the complex to yeast tRNA and CT DNA were exothermic, resulting in negative peaks in the plots of power versus time. The bottom panels in  6 show the plot of the heat evolved per mole of the Ru(II) complex added, corrected for the heat of Ru(II) complex dilution, against the molar ratio of the Ru(II) complex to yeast tRNA (Fig. 6b) and CT DNA (Fig. 6d). The calorimetric data were fitted to a single set of identical sites model and the model employed was the only one yielding a reasonable fitting of the experimental data. The thermodynamic parameters for both binding reactions obtained at 25\u00b0C were summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the interaction of the complex with yeast tRNA was driven by a moderately favorable enthalpy decrease in combination with a moderately favorable entropy increase, while the binding of the complex to CT DNA was driven by a large favorable enthalpy decrease with a less favorable entropy increase.\n\n",

Comparing the binding constants obtained with those of typical DNA-intercalative Ru(II) complexes (1.1\u20134.8\u00d710\u22124 M\u22121) [48] and the parent complex [Ru(phen)3]2+ (5.5\u00d7103 M\u22121) [52], we can deduce that both binding modes of the Ru(II) complex to yeast tRNA and CT DNA are most likely intercalation, that is, the PMIP ligand of the complex intercalates into the double-helical regions of yeast tRNA as it interacts with CT DNA. Also, the characteristics of UV and visible spectra, as well as the binding constants obtained demonstrate that yeast tRNA binding of the complex is stronger than CT DNA binding. A possible explanation for this observation may be due to the A-form configuration and the L-shaped tertiary structure of yeast tRNA, in which the major groove is wide and shallow, thus its base pairs are well exposed and can be attacked by complexes easily. In addition, the complex may bind to the bugle region of yeast tRNA and that may be another reason why RNA binding affinity of the complex is greater.",

The value of K\nb of 4.7\u00b10.3 \u00d7105 M\u22121 obtained from fluorescence titration method is comparable to that for a similar complex [Ru(bpy)2MCP]2+ (1.8\u00d7105 M\u22121, MCP=2-(3-chlorophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline) [53] measured by the same method. For the steady-state fluorescence-quenching experiments of CT DNA binding of the Ru(II) complex, the curvature of the quenching curve reflects different degrees of protection or relative accessibility of bound cations, and a larger slope for the Stern\u2013Volmer plot parallels a poorer protection and weaker binding. The efficiency of quenching of the Ru(II) complex bound to DNA by [Fe(CN)6]4\u2212 is decreased extremely relative to that of the free complex. This may be explained by the fact that the bound cations of the complex are protected effectively from the anionic water-bound quencher by the array of negative charges along the DNA phosphate backbone, and that the complex can interact strongly with DNA. On the other hand, the results from fluorescence titration method for yeast tRNA binding suggest that yeast tRNA can partially quench the fluorescence of the Ru(II) complex. This quenching of fluorescence of the Ru(II) complex by yeast tRNA is most probably due to electron or energy transfer between the Ru(II) complex and yeast tRNA caused by a stronger interaction of the complex with yeast tRNA [54]. In addition, the change in emission for yeast tRNA titration was small, which could contribute to the difficulties in utilizing the Stern\u2013Volmer plot at higher yeast tRNA concentrations.",

The relative viscosity of CT DNA increases with the increase of the concentration of the Ru(II) complex, indicating that the Ru(II) complex binds to DNA through a classical intercalation mode. Such a result is consistent with that obtained from the UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopic studies in this paper.

            "text": "Secondly, the binding constants determined by ITC, by UV-vis spectroscopy, and by fluorescence spectroscopy are different. This is not without precedent. For example, for the interaction of complex [Ru(phen)3]2+ with CT DNA, the binding constant determined by equilibrium dialysis experiments is 6.2 \u00d7 103 M\u22121 [59], but for its enantiomers, the binding constants obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy with McGhee\u2013Von Hippel method are 4.9\u00d7104 for its \u0394 form and 2.8\u00d7104 M\u22121 for the \u039b form [43], and 1.8\u20133.0\u00d7106 M\u22121, 0.3\u20134.2\u00d7106 M\u22121 for the \u0394 and \u039b isomers at different concentrations using the method suggested by Coggan et al. [57]. Moreover, for the enantiomer \u0394-[Ru(phen)2DPPZ]2+ (DPPZ = dipyrido[3,2-a:2\u2032,3\u2032- c]phenazine) interacting with CT DNA, the binding constant determined by Hiort et al. (6.0\u00d7107 M\u22121) [60] from fluorescence titration method is also different from that measured by Haq et al. (3.2\u00d7106 M\u22121) [61] using the same method but with different model. These differences should be caused by the different measurements and the different calculation methods. Furthermore, we should be aware of the importance of the ionic strength of the buffer for the binding of charge ligands to DNA [62, 63], which in part explains the much higher binding constants obtained from ITC in which a different buffer with different ionic strength was used. However, although the binding constants obtained from our ITC experiments are about one order of magnitude higher than those obtained from UV-vis spectroscopy, both sets of binding constants show that yeast tRNA binding of complex [Ru(phen)2PMIP]2+ is 2.6-fold stronger than CT DNA binding of the complex. These results suggest that we can compare RNA or DNA binding strength of one complex with that of the others using binding constant only obtained from the same method with the same model.",

            "text": "Thirdly, ITC experiments show that the interaction of the Ru(II) complex with yeast tRNA is driven by a moderately favorable enthalpy change in combination with a moderately favorable entropy change, while the binding of the complex to CT DNA is driven by a more favorable enthalpy change with a less favorable entropy change. These can be explained by the fact that both binding modes of complex [Ru(phen)2PMIP]2+ to yeast tRNA and CT DNA are intercalation. Once the Ru(II) complex intercalates into the adjacent base pairs of yeast tRNA or CT DNA, a variety of noncovalent molecular interactions, such as stacking interactions of the aromatic ligand in the complex with the base pairs of RNA or DNA, specific hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between the complex and RNA or DNA, may occur [64]. Each of these weak interactions leads to negative enthalpy change [65], and the apparent enthalpy decrease should be the summation of all of these molecular interactions [56]. On the other hand, the favorable entropy change should result from the relaxation of supercoiled yeast tRNA with the L-shaped tertiary structure or CT DNA induced by the intercalation of the complex [66], the liberation of structured water from interacting surfaces, and/or the release of counterions upon binding of positively charged complexes [56, 58]. The increase in entropy for yeast tRNA binding of the complex is more favorable than that for CT DNA binding, suggesting that the extent of relaxation of yeast tRNA induced by the intercalation of the complex may be larger than that of CT DNA owing to its stronger interaction with the complex. ITC results herein further support the conclusion that yeast tRNA binding of the complex is stronger than CT DNA binding reached by UV-vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy.",

The presence of CD signals indicates enrichment of the enantiomer binding less favorably to yeast tRNA or CT DNA. From our CD experiments, we may deduce that, although the Ru(II) complex used has not been resolved into its pure enantiomers, and we cannot determine which enantiomer binds to yeast tRNA and CT DNA enantioselectively experimentally, it is certain that the same isomer of the complex has a special preference for both yeast tRNA and CT DNA binding, and that the complex is a better candidate for an enantioselective binder to yeast tRNA than to CT DNA. According to the proposed binding model [64, 67], the \u0394 enantiomer of the complex, a right-handed propeller-like structure, will display a greater affinity than the \u039b enantiomer with the right-handed CT DNA helix, due to the appropriate steric matching. Although the configuration of CT DNA is different from that of yeast tRNA, both yeast tRNA and CT DNA have the same right-handed helix structure. Therefore, we deduce that the \u0394 enantiomer of the complex may bind more favorably to both yeast tRNA and CT DNA than the \u039b enantiomer does. In addition, the phenomenon that the CD signals for the dialysate of the complex dialyzed against yeast tRNA are much stronger than those for the complex dialyzed against CT DNA may be explained by the fact that yeast tRNA binding of the complex is stronger than CT DNA binding.",
