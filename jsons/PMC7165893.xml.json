Importantly, depletion of neutrophils had no impact on the ability of B6 mice to control MCMV infection in any of the organs examined (Figure 2). This finding indicates that the increased sensitivity to MCMV infection observed in CatC\u2212/\u2212 mice is not consistent with a defect in neutrophil function.",

As a number of Gzms are involved in antigen processing (reviewed in Zavasnik\u2010Bergant and Turk\n15\n), the capacity of CatC\u2212/\u2212 dendritic cells (DCs) to process exogenous antigen was assessed. Antigen processing was assessed using DQ\u2010ovalbumin (DQ\u2010OVA). DQ\u2010OVA is a self\u2010quenched OVA conjugate that fluoresces only after proteolytic processing. Splenocytes were isolated from na\u00efve B6, CatC\u2212/\u2212 or GzmAB\u2212/\u2212 mice and incubated with DQ\u2010OVA at either 37 \u00b0C or 4 \u00b0C. The incubation at 4 \u00b0C provides a control for nonenzymatic processing of DQ\u2010OVA. Splenocytes were then stained with antibodies against CD11c and MHCII, and cells analyzed by FACS. The percentage of DCs (CD11c+MHCII+) in the spleen was equivalent in all the mouse strains tested (Figure 4a). Furthermore, processing of DQ\u2010OVA by DCs was equivalent in the three mouse strains (Figure 4b). Thus, deletion of CatC or GzmAB does not impair the capacity of DCs to process exogenous antigen.",

CD8+ T cells were purified from the spleen of wild\u2010type or relevant knockout mice at day 6 p.i. with MCMV. The capacity of lysates prepared from purified CD8+ T cells to cleave a GzmB\u2010specific substrate was then assessed. Significant GzmB activity was detected in lysates from wild\u2010type CD8+ T cells (Figure 7a). The specificity of the assay is demonstrated by the finding that no significant cleavage of the substrate occurred when lysates prepared from GzmAB\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells were used (Figure 7a). Importantly, although the GzmB activity of CatC\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells is below that found in wild\u2010type cells, active GzmB is clearly present in these cells (Figure 7a).

Expression of integrins is essential for some aspects of T\u2010cell function, such as homing to sites of inflammation.\n19\n Hence, although expansion of antigen\u2010specific T cells occurs normally in CatC\u2212/\u2212 mice, it is possible these cells may be functionally impaired. Furthermore, GzmB activity in CatC\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells is lower than that of wild\u2010type cells (Figure 7a). We therefore tested the possibility that the function of CatC\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells may be impaired; this was achieved by measuring the in vivo CTL response of CatC\u2212/\u2212 mice.

Similarly, the clearance of peptide\u2010pulsed targets in the liver of MCMV\u2010infected CatC\u2212/\u2212 or GzmAB\u2212/\u2212 mice was equivalent to that of wild\u2010type mice (Figure 7c).

The in vivo CTL assay quantifies CTL activity by measuring the loss of specific peptide\u2010pulsed targets in comparison with targets that have not been pulsed with peptide. Here, target cell lysis was measured using a modification of the previously described in vivo CTL assay.\n34\n M45 peptide\u2010pulsed (0.02 \u03bcg ml\u22121) splenocyte targets were labeled with a low concentration (final (0.025 \u03bcm)) of 5,6\u2010carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes), whereas control targets not pulsed with peptide were labeled with a high concentration (final (0.25 \u03bcm)) of CFSE. Labeled cells were washed to remove free CFSE and differential labeling confirmed by flow cytometry. CFSE\u2010low M45\u2010pulsed targets and CFSE\u2010high unpulsed control targets were resuspended in PBS, mixed in equal proportions, and a total of 4 \u00d7 107 cells per mouse transferred intravenously into syngeneic mice that had been infected with MCMV for various periods of time. Mice were killed 4 h later and single\u2010cell suspensions from spleen analyzed by flow cytometry. Transferred cells serve as targets for peptide\u2010specific CTL. The frequency of unpulsed targets serves as an internal control for trafficking, recovery and nonspecific cell loss. The loss of specific peptide\u2010pulsed targets is a measure of CTL activity against targets pulsed with the M45 viral peptide. Specific lysis was determined using the following formula: Percentage specific lysis of CFSE\u2010labeled target cells in each mouse is calculated as follows: (1\u2212(r uninfected control mouse/r infected test mouse)) \u00d7 100 where r=frequency of unpulsed targets/frequency of peptide\u2212pulsed targets.
