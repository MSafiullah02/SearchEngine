And many new compounds are being discovered in plants, animals, and fungi every year. 10 Most of them exist in nature as free acids, as esters with fatty acids, ferulic acid, etc., or as triterpenoid saponins linked with one or more sugar chains. They are often the main active constituents of many important medicinal plants, such as the ginsenosides in Panax ginseng, glycyrrhizin in Glycyrrhiza uralensis and saikosaponins in Radix Bupleuri. [11] [12] [13] Triterpenoids display a variety of structures with nearly 200 different skeletons known from natural sources or enzymatic reactions, although many are variants of a smaller number of common structural types. 14 Many pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs) show a wide range of pharmacological activities, and some are marketed as therapeutic agents or dietary supplements. 15 Structurally, PTs have four six-membered rings called A, B, C, D with ring E being five-membered or six-membered.

The structural diversity of PTs provides a unique group of agents with a variety of pharmacological activities, 18 including antiviral, antitumor, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities. Presently, the newly discovered PTs are a subject of annual review, reflecting the increasing importance of this class of compounds. 18 The available reviews cover the chemistry, 19, 20 antitumor activity, [21] [22] [23] anti-inflammatory activity, 24 bioavailability, 25 and other pharmacological activity. 18 Recently, the antiviral activities of PTs are attracting increasing attention. In Japan, Stronger Neo-Minophagen C TM (SNMC), a preparation containing glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid, 1) has been used in the treatment of chronic hepatic diseases for over 40 years. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA, 2) (Fig. 3) , a PT derivative of the -amyrin type, is obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin 1, which is isolated from the herb liquorice and shows inhibition on a variety of viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV. 26 In 1989, saponin B1 and B2, two oleanane-type triterpenoids isolated from soybean seeds, have been reported to have activity against HIV at concentrations greater than 2 and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. 27 Three years later, Chen et al. reported that salaspermic acid (3), another oleanane-type triterpene derivative isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii, can block the replication of HIV in H9 lymphocytes (IC 50 : 10 M). 28 Afterwards, Fujioka et al. found that betulinic acid (BA, 4), isolated from the leaves and barks of Syzigium claviflorum, also showed significant activity against HIV (EC 50 : 1.4 M). 29 Since then, more and more natural PTs have been reported to have antiviral activity. It is well known that lipids, a class of hydrophobic biomolecules, are important for cellular life, especially during virus entry into the host cell. It was reported that the promiscuous antiviral activities of natural PTs might be related to the effect of lipid metabolism. 30, 31 Synthetic chemists become more interested in these scaffolds due to their potential antiviral properties, leading to the production of a variety of PT derivatives through modifications of the C3-OH, C17-COOH, and other functional groups. Some of these derivatives are used as clinical drugs for the treatment of liver-related diseases, while others are at various phases of clinical trials. 20 For example, the BA derivative Bevirimat (BVM, 5), also known as 3-O-(3 \u2032 ,3 \u2032dimethylsuccinyl) BA (DSB) or PA-457, was found to exhibit remarkable anti-HIV activity against primary and drugresistant HIV isolates. 32 It represents a unique first in class anti-HIV compound termed maturation inhibitors (MIs). 33 Due to the baseline gag polymorphisms at positions Q369, V370, or T371, which reduced the sensitivity of HIV-1 to Bevirimat (5), it was halted for further development in 2010. 34, 35 Recently, the second class of potent PTs BMS-955176 (6) and GSK-2838232 (7) are under development as oral treatment of HIV infection. [36] [37] [38] [39] However, up to now, there is no review focusing on the activity of PTs against viral infection. 40 The focus of the present review is to summarize the recent advances in the antiviral activities and action models of PTs to aid the antiviral drug development of PTs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 116, "text": "5 H 8 )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 163, "end": 165, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 716, "end": 718, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 915, "end": 917, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1155, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1202, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1205, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1226, "end": 1230, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1235, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1240, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1271, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1291, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1330, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1855, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2057, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2274, "end": 2276, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2461, "end": 2463, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2824, "end": 2827, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2828, "end": 2830, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3222, "end": 3224, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3439, "end": 3441, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3534, "end": 3536, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3713, "end": 3716, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3717, "end": 3719, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3854, "end": 3858, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3859, "end": 3863, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3864, "end": 3868, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3869, "end": 3873, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3970, "end": 3972, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 706, "end": 713, "text": "Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1632, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2258, "end": 2266, "text": "(IC 50 :", "ref_id": null}], "section": "F I G U R E 1 Different types of PT skeletons"}, {"text": "HIV is a lentivirus that could lead to HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 41 Because of the lack of CD4-positive T cells, HIV patients are exposed to life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers without normal immune protection. 42, 43 Fortunately, HIV-1 infection can be effectively managed with a longterm administration of multiple antiviral inhibitors designated as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). 44 Since Zidovudine (ZDV, also known as azidothymidine, AZT) was launched in 1987 as the first anti-HIV drug that targets HIV reverse transcriptase, so far over 40 formulations have been approved by FDA for HIV therapy.
