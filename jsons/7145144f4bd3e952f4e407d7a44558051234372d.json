Disease-related mortality, like that of patients with SARS, also correlated with advanced tissue fibrosis of the lung and, possibly, persistent hypoxemia and oxygen deprivation-related organ failure. 6, 12 It therefore is worth noting that abnormalities of the production and, probably, the composition of surfactant could be attributed mostly to the dysfunction of gas exchange, alveolar deformation, and oxygen deprivation-mediated systemic organ failure in patients with ARDS or SARS. 6, 12 Moreover, based on the characteristics of positive-strand RNA genome, replication mode, and infection route, 4,8 the SARS virus would prefer infecting cells that have a membrane receptor for the virus and are ready for protein synthesis, ie, type II pneumocytes of the lung. Our pathologic findings supported such speculation by showing that the SARS virus could infect mainly type II cells and the infected type II cell might not only reduce the production of bona fide surfactant but also increase the expression product of the viral protein. 8, 13 Interestingly, amino acid sequences further indicated that the SARS viral protein might contain several potential chemokine-like motifs, 14 in particular, within the replicase polyprotein 1ab region.

[1] [2] [3] [4] With potential chemokine-like motifs and intrinsic enzyme activity, it is likely that SARS viral products would elicit an unconventional immune response that resembles the acute phase of histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, with a dramatic increase of the CD68+ histiocyte population \u275aTable 3\u275a SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; +, positive; +++, strong positive; -, negative; \u00b1, intermediate. * Antisense oligonucleotide probes specific, respectively, to the replicase-encoding region (REP) and the nucleic acid binding protein-encoding (N) and membrane protein-encoding (M) regions of the SARS viral genome were used to determine the viral signal by in situ hybridization. Intensity of the viral signal was measured by scanning of the specific cell types following in situ hybridization. \u2020 The interval between the onset of fever and the sample collection. \u2021 Although case 1 was traced epidemiologically as the origin of outbreak in Taiwan, the subject was not contagious at the time when open-lung biopsy was performed. In the clinical behavior of SARS infection, the patient is most contagious when the fever persists; after fever subsides, the patient becomes less contagious or not contagious. 6 locally. 9 In the chronic phase, the extent of CD68+ histiocytes decreased considerably, and foamy histiocytes became predominant. In this phase, the REP signal in enlarged and multinucleated cells became limited. Unlike histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, though, no karyorrhectic bodies were detected within the cytoplasm of infected epithelial cells or histiocytes, and these pathologic appearances would lower the possibility of adenovirus or cytomegalovirus involvement, in which karyorrhexis, necrotizing exudates, and intranuclear inclusion bodies are abundant. 19 Moreover, these pathologic observations also corresponded well with the clinical behavior of the disease, in which patients were most contagious when the fever persisted. 6 On the other hand, the infected lesion limited to the lower respiratory tract, ie, the type II pneumocyte in the alveolus, further correlated with dry cough, and the symptoms would be less consistent with infection by the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, hantavirus, or respiratory syncytial virus that could broadly infect the bronchiolar epithelium. 19 Our results demonstrate that in the SARS virus-infected lung, the viral signal is defined mostly within epithelial cells, in particular, pneumocytes. The impact of SARS viral expression on mortality could be via the downregulation of surfactant production, which in turn leads to alveolar filling, alveolar collapse, tissue fibrosis, and pulmonary dysfunction. Expression of the SARS viral REP region, in which certain regions resemble a chemokine motif, would further result in an increased histiocyte population and, hence, deteriorated local inflammation. Undoubtedly, both hypotheses remain to be verified, and the effect of SARS viral infection on host gene regulation, in particular, the \"cytokine dysregulation\" that might be induced aberrantly in the macrophages and the surrounding tissues of the afflicted lung, 18 deserves more in-depth study. It is clear, however, that REP expression can be associated directly or indirectly with the severity of SARS disease and, possibly, the mechanism of tissue dysfunction, and this in and of itself should provide an interesting target for discovering and designing a novel therapeutic protocol for SARS viral infection, if the disease should persist and recur. 13 ",
