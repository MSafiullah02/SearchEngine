So, then in those patients that are cognitively impaired should we be considering routinely assessing their primary care giver (if there is one) also? When assessing the survivors, the authors have differing definitions for a survivor; some eg Bunch 2003, 2626 calls those with a CPC greater than or equal to 3 non-survivors. Saner 2002, 7 excluded those with severe hypoxic brain injury (but does not quantify how many of these there were) and Dimopoulou 2001, 7 excludes the sickest patients post cardiac surgery. In contrast Van Alem 2004, 131 provided a proxy questionnaire for relatives to fill out when the patients are unable to do so secondary to cognitive impairment. Therefore results need to be analysed accordingly, based on which 'survivors' may or may not have been excluded from the studies; excluding those with CPC 3/4 is likely to influence the results in a positive way with respect to quality of life This worksheet addresses the question: \"In cardiac arrest patients (in hospital and pre hospital) does resuscitation produce a good quality of life for survivors after discharge from hospital?\" The answer is yes.",

For those that could not respond to questionnaires because of poor cognitive function -a proxy version of SIP was used to interview close relatives. They used elderly Dutch population and patients who had suffered a stroke as controls. 77% of the patients did not need help from others. Quality of life (using SIP) was slightly to moderately poorer than in the elderly population but better than those who had suffered a stroke. Stiell 2003 , 1939 s group had a large cohort -268 patients who survived out of hospital arrest and were assessed at 1 year post event with the HUI3 (looks at 8 attributes of health -vision, hearing, speech, mobility, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain). They compared the HUI3 scores with scores from the national population health survey of Canada. At 1 year 86% had CPC 1 and no-one had CPC 4 or 5. Median HUI score 0.8 (range 0.5-0.97), most survivors scored greater than 0.8. A few patients scored less than zero -which equated to a state worse than death! There are a significant number of studies that we have allocated as 'neutral'. This is because many of the studies demonstrated significant deficits and/or reduction in quality of life through parameters such as social isolation, cognitive impairment, daily functioning, depression and anxiety, but what the authors stopped short of doing was stating whether these issues meant that the patient's quality of life was unbearably poor. Most of these studies could be said to have mixed findings.",

Assessed50 patients 5 -68 months post arrest using psychological general well being index questionnaire, Nottingham health profile (NHP) and everyday life questionnaire. Patients judged their well being as unchanged pre and post arrest. NHP revealed significant differences between survivors and controls in emotional reactions, energy levels, physical mobility and sleep. Levels of anxiety and depression, well being and vitality were also significantly different. 49 of 50 patients judged their life as worth living. SAUVE(1995): Sauve M.J.
