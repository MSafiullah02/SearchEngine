Orders published by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, 1st of July, 1665 defined essential workers, laid out quarantine regulations, and restricted disorderly tippling in taverns, ale-houses and coffee-houses. Desirous of flattening the curve they shut people in their houses a \"cruel and unchristian method, and the poor people so confined made bitter lamentations.\" The physician, Heath, directed Defoe\"s narrator \"to hold in my mouth when I was in the streets.\" Sound policy then and now emerged and wise voices were finally heard. We might also have benefited from listening to the past, even the recent past; SARS was just 17 years ago.",

Understandably many papers deal with medical issues, but a noticeable fraction relate to environmental concerns with widespread comment on improved air quality during this period of reduced economic and social activity [2] . However, extreme events may not have declined [3] . There are already suggestions that the high air pollution typical of the Po valley of Northern Italy had sensitized residents to the virus and explains some the impact there [4] ; similar links have been suggested for the United States [5] . Other papers suggest that the deaths from air pollution are much greater than the lives lost from COVID-19 [2] . Grim statistics are also to be found in the work of John Graunt from17 th London [6] , when severe pollution harvested out the older or less healthy individuals leading to a set of more resistant survivors [7] . The effect of COVID-19 on the urban environment is wide ranging, with observations of the way the quarantines and lock-downs affect commuting patterns [8] , sound and vibration [9] , urban water supply [10] and the prevalence of wild flowers and animals [11] .",

These are predicted to be times of great economic loss, potentially in excess of a trillion US dollars. Some argue that the world will never be the same, and Suzy Taherian [12] suggests that supply chains will be local rather than global. In future we will shop, work, and play online, with the digital divide becoming a chasm. Healthcare for all will become the norm. Cities it is claimed will alter as a response to radically changed urban life [13] . As alluded to in an earlier editorial [14] , urban planners face a tension between densification and disaggregation. As Jack Shenker points out \"if proximity to one\"s job is no longer a significant factor in deciding where to live, for example, then the appeal of the suburbs wanes; we could be heading towards a world in which existing city centres and far-flung \"new villages\" rise in prominence, while traditional commuter belts fade away.\"",
