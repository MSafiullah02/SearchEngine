In a letter dated 27th March 2020, the French Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9 (DGS) referred the matter to the French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9; HAS), with a view to drawing up general recommendations designed to ensure continuity of care for pregnant women during lockdown and travel restrictions. Given the very limited data available, the French High Council for Public Health considered pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy to be at risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 [1]. Rare cases of vertical transmission of the virus have been identified (even though no placental viremia, or presence of the virus in amniotic fluid or in cord blood has been published to date) [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. The extension of lockdown and the role and workload of healthcare professionals, lead to re-interviewing organizations for the follow-up of pregnant women in terms of prevention and care. These rapid responses focus on the conditions and organization of the return home of mothers and their children during the lockdown period and the management of cases of women with COVID-19 (without signs of severity) and their newborns returning home. They should be adapted according to the geographical particularities of the epidemic outbreak and access to local resources. These rapid responses are based on the knowledge available at the time of publication and are subject to change as new information becomes available.",

In the French context, the HAS considers it more prudent to consider any newborn of a COVID + mother as a carrier of the virus. Testing the newborn is therefore not justified. The precautions to be taken are to stay confined at home with the child, to avoid too close contact with family members (especially siblings and people at risk), to wear a surgical mask and to have strict hand hygiene. Temperature and appearance of symptoms of respiratory infection should be monitored in both mother and child.",

The French Society of Neonatology (SFN) stresses that the results of a test would not influence maternity unit practices (no separation of mother and child and possible breastfeeding) or the implementation of protection and surveillance measures in the event of an infected mother or child (while nevertheless protecting the other children in the household). Indeed, since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, children, especially newborns, are a more protected group, as evidenced by the low proportion of children among the total number of infected persons (between 1 and 5%) and the more benign nature of their infection [10].",
