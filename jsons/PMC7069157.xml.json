Its diagnostic mechanism was detailed out previously [13]. Briefly here, for each test, a ViroTrack micofluidic loaded with 30 mcl of blood sample was inserted into a portable opto-magnetic reader \u2013 the BluBox. The sample was centrifuged, metered, and mixed with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) pre-coated with anti-dengue antibodies located within the cartridge. Dengue NS1 antigen, if present, formed sandwich agglutination with these MNPs and were forced to rotate under an oscillating magnetic field, which modulated the intensity of a laser beam passing through them. A photodetector with a Blu-ray optical pickup unit would then measure the phase difference between the modulated light transmission and the applied field, which corresponded to the level of dengue NS1 antigen. This measurement was presented in a relative unit and interpreted by the BluBox according to a pre-set threshold value, where positive was defined as > = 27, negative if < 23, and equivocal (EQ) if 23\u201326.9 unit. The whole process after the insertion of the microfluidic was automatic and the result was ready in less than 15 min. The results were recorded by one research assistant and verified by three others independently. For analysis, a patient was considered tested positive for ViroTrack Dengue Acute if either capillary or venous sample was positive, EQ if both were EQ, and negative for all other combinations. No repetition was done for EQ results.",

In other words, the apparent difference in diagnostic accuracy and utility parameters between two tests evaluated in two different studies may be due to the difference between their study characteristics instead of the actual performance of the tests themselves. However, diagnostic tests evaluated within the same study on the same patient population under the same condition can be directly compared [37]. In this study, among all the individual assays, SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA had the best performance followed by ViroTrack, SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1, IgM and IgG components. This outcome is expected as both ELISA and ViroTrack employed objective result read-out based on physical properties of light transmission in contrast to the subjective interpretation of SD RDT [8, 13\u201315, 18, 30].",

However, the decline in performance was more obvious for SD NS1 RDT as reducing level of NS1 towards the end of the week might produce a test line too faint to be detected with naked eyes [8]. On the contrary, serology-only assays performed better after day 5 when IgM and IgG started to be secreted to counter the infectious agent [5, 7, 17, 18, 22, 29, 30, 40\u201344].

Further analysis (data not shown) showed that there were more patients beyond the 5th day of illness among those with DENV-1, which may partially explain these results. On the other hand, the failure of all assays to detect the sole DENV-4 was probably due to chance, as this patient had secondary dengue (with low IgM level) on 5th day of illness, when the level of free and detectable IgG and NS1 happened to be too low after their union in vivo [23, 45, 47, 48].

As shown in Table 4, tested positive for SD NS1/IgM RDT was able to double the probability of dengue infection in a patient to be more than 90%, leaving only less than 10 out of 100 wrongly diagnosed non-dengue patients. Although all individual assays except SD IgG RDT were able to more or less match this performance, they could not reproduce the same when it came to negative tests. If a patient was tested negative for any of the individual assays, the best post-test probability of dengue was still 23.0%. In other word, at least 23 out of 100 dengue patients were FN that might have been misdiagnosed. In contrast, SD combo tests were able to reduce FN to just 15 to 18 per 100 dengue patients. While dengue FP may not be a big concern due to its small proportion and relatively less harmful supportive treatment unless in the case of misdiagnosis of other more severe diseases, high number of FN might lead to late diagnosis and delayed administration of required life-saving treatment for dengue patients. As such, in a clinical setting, especially in primary care, it is important for a dengue RDT to act as a screening tool that can detect more cases with minimal FN.",

It requires only 30 mcl of blood specimen compared to 100 mcl required for SD NS1 RDT. This feature is important when blood sampling is difficult and yield is scarce, such as among paediatric patients. Its test procedure requires minimal training, and is as simple and user-friendly as that of SD RDT at least in terms of sample loading, but its test duration is slightly shorter. Still, after loading blood sample, ViroTrack must be inserted into a Blubox, an electronic device that runs on electricity. This may create a bottleneck if more than one sample must be run concurrently, unless commercialised version of Blubox comes with the ability to run multiple tests. Yet, the presence of Blubox increases test sensitivity and reduces number of false positive from delayed interpretation common for immunochromatographic tests [8]. Furthermore, its ability to connect with local and global network reduces the rate of manual transcription error in reporting [52], and makes results available immediately upon diagnosis to treating doctors and public health authority for quick intervention [53]. Nevertheless, ViroTrack must first be available in the form of a combo test and proven to be more accurate, cost-effective, and beneficial in future studies for this new technology to be popularised.",

In the same way, it is also fundamentally incorrect to directly apply their results into daily practice or for policy making. Good performances reported in case-control or laboratory-based studies may be due to biases instead of the discriminatory power of the evaluated tests [7, 39]. In contrast, the cross-sectional prospective design in an actual primary care clinical setting seen in this study produced a more realistic set of diagnostic performance parameters that is true to other similar clinical settings, making the application of its results easier and more valid. Besides, it complied with STARD-guidelines for quality assurance [10]. In addition, diagnostic utility presented here is more intelligible to clinical practitioners and policy makers compared to the usually reported diagnostic accuracy. With simple calculation based on the formulas provided here or using rough estimation, the diagnostic utility of the three index tests evaluated in this study can be estimated for any clinical setting [24, 54]. However, it should be cautioned that this exercise took into account only dengue diagnostics without consideration of other diseases. Practitioners should also use existing clinical reasoning for differential diagnosis.",

This study was the first conducted prospectively among consecutively sampled patients in primary care setting. It provided better and more updated insight on the application of dengue RDT in Malaysia. Furthermore, it was the first that evaluated a biosensors-based RDT in this setting and compared it with extensively used RDT and NS1 ELISA for a more comprehensive understanding of their relative performance, which is absent in most other studies that evaluated only either RDT or ELISA. Two limitations of this study are, first, only single sample was collected from each patient, making the reference standard based on serology presumptive rather than conclusive [6, 20, 39]; and second, the diagnostic utility calculated was based on the pre-test probability of disease based on the WHO 2009 guidelines without taking into account of the haematological result. Nevertheless, these limitations perfectly reflect the actual situation faced by clinicians in the front line, making the study results more realistic and applicable to the real-world circumstances.",

The addition of serology component to SD Bioline Dengue Duo, however, greatly enhanced its diagnostic accuracy and utility parameters almost beyond that of SD Dengue NS1 ELISA, making it a better point-of-care dengue diagnostic tool as it would miss the fewest dengue patients. As such, ViroTrack Dengue Acute can be a potential alternative to existing combo RDTs only if its combination with serology components matches or outperforms them in diagnosing dengue. This decision making should be based on the results of properly conducted diagnostic test accuracy and economic evaluation studies in the future that allow within-study comparison of multiple diagnostic tools instead of comparing between heterogeneous studies.",
