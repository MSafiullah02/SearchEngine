The total number of global deaths on the date of submitting this paper (24 April 2020) has risen to 191.263, with 2.717.004 infected (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020c). The economic impact will be undoubtedly colossal and we are still unaware of the real consequences this will have on each country's economy and on the labor market. It is not the first pandemic that we have suffered, but the dimensions of this one are especially shocking and only comparable to the flu pandemic of 1918, a little over a century ago. It is certainly a public health threat that goes beyond occupational health and safety, and it transgresses the borders of business organizations, being of primary concern to virologists and epidemiologists, but also to technicians, specialists and academics in the field of safety who can make a significant contribution to its prevention. In addition to the past and present research carried out to create detection tests, vaccines, antivirals and other treatments, the main measures used in the health, work and domestic spheres have focused on social distancing and lockdown, as well as on the monitoring of safety protocols, the adoption of hygiene measures, and the use of personal protection equipment such as masks, gloves, etc. This has meant that terms that were previously used by occupational health and safety professionals alone, such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, KN95, etc., have become part of the common language and have had a positive effect in the field of health and safety by popularizing and increasing the culture of prevention of society as a whole.",

It initially made different recommendations for the groups including healthcare personnel, people in direct contact with the infected and people with symptoms (Holland et al., 2020 , Jansson et al., 2020 on the one hand, and for the rest of the people on the other. While recommending the use of masks for the first three groups of people, it did not do the same for individuals, where it focused on measures of social distancing, minimum interpersonal distance, and personal hygiene, more specifically the adequate washing of hands, since airborne propagation was ruled out under normal conditions (WHO, 2020a) . To date, although the WHO acknowledges that \"wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19\" (WHO, 2020c) it also says that \"however, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted\". Therefore, on 20 April 2020, it still recommends that \"If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with COVID-19\" (WHO, 2020b) . Nevertheles, it advises that each country apply a risk-based approach, that is, considering the benefits (possibility of reducing the potential risk of exposure during the presymptomatic period) as well as the potential risks (self-contamination, false sense of security, impact on mask shortages), when deciding whether to recommend the use of masks by the general population (WHO, 2020c) .",

Furthermore, this situation is expected to persist for some time, since the WHO itself estimates that approximately 89 million medical masks are needed each month to respond to COVID-19 (WHO, 2020d) . This is why governments, hospitals, companies and even individuals, have also begun to look for solutions of all kinds, including the reuse, cleaning and disinfection of certified disposable masks, either Personal Protection Equipment or medical, and the manufacture of homemade or non-certified ones (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020a) .

Thus, in this publication we conducted a rapid review of scientific publications, preprints, protocols, guides and other information available online with two objectives. On the one hand, to identify in the scientific literature the effectiveness of disposable or non-certified masks. On the other hand, to identify the main strategies for their disinfection and/or sterilization, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. (UNE, 2020a (UNE, , 2020b (UNE, , 2020d . These masks are intended for people or children without symptoms who are not susceptible to using surgical, medical or PPE/filter masks to protect them against particles, in accordance with the restrictions established by the Government of Spain, which currently recommends these latest types of masks for healthcare workers and people infected or with symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, table 1 focus on disposable mask such as PPE, medical mask and others that can be single use (non-reusable hygienic mask) or some uses (barrier mask, reusable hygienic mask, cloth mask\u2026). Reusable face mask respirators, such as reusable half mask or full face mask, that allow long-term use by changing their filters are not included in this classification (see picture 3). Due to the public health threat caused by SARS-COV-2, there has been a lack of disposable masks certified to meet European technical standards. In this situation, the European Commission published the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/403 of March 13, 2020 on conformity assessment and market surveillance procedures within the context of the COVID-19 threat to allow, as long as the shortage lasts, the commercialization of PPE or medical devices that comply with non-European standards even if they do not have the CE marking. WHO recommendations may be followed for their selection, but an adequate level of protection must be guaranteed and the corresponding notifying authority immediately informed (European Commission, 2020) .",

Thus, individuals and even organizations began to prepare masks from different types of materials that allow users to cover their mouth and nose.

(2008) compared in a laboratory the protection for airborne particles of surgical masks against FFP respirators and found the lowest level of respiratory protection in surgical masks against FFP respirators. Specifically, they calculated a reduction factor for exposure to live aerosolized influenza virus as the ratio of the particle concentration inside and outside for each mask. Their results indicated that a properly adjusted FFP respirator can provide a mean reduction factor in exposure of 100 while a surgical mask would provide a mean reduction factor of 6. On the other hand, Lee et al (2008) have undertaken the task of comparing the N95 respirators and surgical masks against particles representing bacterial and viral size ranges. As a result, their study found that around 29% of N95 respirators and 100% of surgical masks had a protection factor <10 (protection factor set by OSHA for that type of mask). So, they concluded that the N95s may not offer the expected protection level against bacteria and viruses. However, in 2016 we found the work of Smith et al. (2016) in which they compared the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers from acute respiratory infection. Their study did not find sufficient evidence to uniquely determine that N95 respirators are superior to surgical masks as protection for healthcare workers against acute respiratory infections in clinical settings.",

If the worker stores and uses their FFP respirators in order each day, a minimum of five days between the use of each FFP respirator elapses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a).

It therefore appears that this method is of singular importance. Therefore, Song et al. (2020) Based on this, they proposed practical recommendations to implement a simple disinfection box system using inexpensive and readily available components that could be used for FFP respirators. The ozone concentrations required are 10 to 20 ppm with an exposure for at least 10 minutes. They noted that it is an improvised solution for situations of need such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but not an optimal long-term solution. Among the advantages of ozone gas, they indicated that its virucidal action is faster than the degradation effect of the FFP respirator, which is effective for disinfecting fibrous materials, as it is a dry virucidal, and that it reaches shadows and crevices in the process disinfection, unlike ultraviolet radiation as will be seen later. Recently, another report also focusing on the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) on FFP respirators (N95) has been published online by Nebrasca Medicine (Lowe et al., 2020) . However, it must be considered that the effectiveness of UV depends on the dose or fluence and shading, since it only inactivates by irradiating surfaces.

Therefore, it would be necessary to develop methods or procedures that can eliminate this uncertainty. In this regard, Fisher and Shaffer (2011) established a method to evaluate decontamination of inner layers of FFP respirators (N95) using ultraviolet-C. Therefore, based on this study, a standard procedure could be established to evaluate the effectiveness of UVGI in the inner layers and confirm or rule out its possible use for the inactivation of the coronavirus in FFP respirators.",

In fact, some methods require specific technology or resources that make the decontamination process more expensive. In this sense, dry heat seems to be cheap. Another factor to consider would be that the method chosen for disinfection must be adapted to the needs of the companies in terms of time and amounts of decontaminated FFP respirators. They must also be logistically and organizationally viable. Even it can take into account other issues such as the traceability of the process or the confidence that is generated in the workers who must reuse the FFP respirators.",

As a result, the viral load on both glass carriers and PPE materials decreased after exposure to PX-UV.Numerous studies are therefore currently being carried out to determine its effectiveness for decontamination against the coronavirus. O'Hearn et al.(2020),have developed a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of FFP respirators(N95) after decontamination with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). They have analyzed 13 papers and have concluded that the filtering effectiveness of FFP respirator is maintained after a UVGI cycle and they propose the use of a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 in future research to validate this promising method. Likewise, they have indicated that it will be necessary to carry out fit tests. Moreover,Card et al (2020) analyzed the possibility of using biosafety cabinets for the decontamination of FFP respirators (N95) by ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). For this purpose, they tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle biosafety cabinets in which they measured the minimum intensity and obtained a factor of 1:71 and 1:98 less than the maximums of each biosafety cabinet, respectively. Based on the maximum observed ratio (1:98), they estimated the sterilization time for FFP respirators (N95) in a biosafety cabinet. Finally, they developed a protocol to disinfect an FFP respirator after irradiating it for 15-20 minutes per side with a fluence of 100 \u00b5Wcm -2 (per manufacturer's records).",

Additionally, washing with soapy water can also affect the electrostatic properties of the fibers or even deform the mask (Ministry of Labor and Social Economy, 2020).Regarding the use of gamma radiation and based on previous studies, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control(2020)indicated that coronaviruses are inactivated with a gamma radiation dose of 20kGy (2MRad). However, possible deformations appear with a dose of 24kGy on the FFP respirator and therefore, the inner filtering layer and the fit are compromised (Fedmann et al., 2019). As for steam sterilization, like the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (2020) of the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, the International Medical Center of Beijing(2020)indicates on its website that there is a reduction in the efficiency of FFP respirators to below 95% and serious deformation when subjected to the steamer damp heat method with high pressure and high temperature. Nevertheless, a study by Stafondford Medicine(Price and Chu, 2020) indicates that hot water steam could be used for 3 treatment cycles or less while maintaining a filtration efficiency of >95%, but for a greater number of cycles they found that the filtration efficiency was affected. Based on this, Spanish Society of Preventive Medicine, Public Health and Hygiene (2020) indicates that water vapor could be used to cycle at 65\u00b0C for 30 minutes for decontamination of FFP respirator.",
