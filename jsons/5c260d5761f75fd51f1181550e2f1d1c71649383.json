One possible explanation for this specificity could be due to the tissue-specific expression of the varying importin-a isoforms. A clear case of changes in the expression pattern of one particular importin-a isoform has been observed during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into neurons, which modulate the shift of expression from KPNA2 to KPNA1 during development (9) . Similarly, malfunction of the cellular transport machinery is commonly observed in multiple cancers; in particular, KPNA2, compared to other isoforms, is a major translocator of cancer-associated proteins. In recent years, both cancer cells and tissues have been shown to express elevated transcriptional levels (510-fold) of KPNA2 compared to normal cells and tissues (10, 11) . Thus, KPNA2 has emerged as a potential biomarker for multiple cancer forms, including melanoma, cervical cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer, liver cancer and bladder cancer (12) . In addition, it is also important to develop selective inhibitors that block specific isoforms without affecting the bulk of NLS cargo proteins shuttling through the NPC.

Moreover, such selected aptamers have been shown to have a higher capacity for molecular discrimination compared to antibodies. In the past, we were able to select efficient aptamers that distinguish between closely related influenza subtypes (1517) and recognize herpes simplex viruses (18) . In this study, we have explored the aptamer selection strategy to isolate aptamers that bind efficiently to KPNA2 and distinguish it from other isoforms of the importin-a family of proteins. We have carried out a total of eight selection cycles using a completely random RNA pool in the presence of KPNA2. The KPNA2 specific aptamers were enriched in the eighth selected pool and, upon sequencing, we identified two major sequences belonging to clone 76 (22%) and clone 72 (4%).

The RNA was briefly heated to 95 C and then cooled to room temperature to form stable structures before the selection steps. In the selection cycles, tRNA (total tRNA from E. coli, Roche, Switzerland) was used as a non-specific competitor. After the RNA was incubated with mouse KPNA2 at room temperature for 10 min, the proteinRNA complexes were filtered through a pre-wetted nitrocellulose acetate filter (HAWP filter, 0.45 mm, 13.0-mm, Merck Millipore, USA) fitted in a 'pop-top' filter holder (Nucleopore) and washed with 1 ml of RNA binding buffer.

To evaluate the mouse KPNA2 binding to the RNA pools from selection cycles 1, 3, 5 and 8 as well as the individual aptamers, internally labeled RNA was prepared using 0.5 mCi/ml [a-32 P]ATP and binding experiments were performed using a filter binding assay similar to those previously reported (21) . The binding and in vitro transcription conditions were similar to those used for selection, except for the RNA and mouse KPNA2 protein concentrations. For the evaluation of binding of RNA pools (from 1, 3, 5 and 8 selection cycles) to the mouse KPNA2 protein, we used 20 nM of labeled RNA and different concentration (490, 980 or 1960 nM) of mouse KPNA2. The RNAKPNA2 complexes retained on the filters were washed with 1 ml binding buffer and air dried and the radioactivity was quantified with an image analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film, Japan). To ensure that the binding was specific, we performed binding assays in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of tRNA as a nonspecific competitor. Similarly, these RNA pools were also evaluated under similar conditions for their binding ability to another importin family subclass mouse KPNA1. Individual clones (aptamers 76, 72 and 21) binding ability to the mouse KPNA2 was evaluated using 25 nM of labeled RNA using [a-32 P]ATP in the presence of 10-fold molar excess of tRNA and mouse KPNA2 protein (246, 492 and 984 nM).

Initially, HeLa cells were cultured on an eight-well slide slip for two days in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were then permeabilized with digitonin and then the cytosolic components were washed out with transport buffer (20 mM HEPESKOH pH 7.3, 110 mM CH 3 COOK, 5 mM CH 3 COONa, 2 mM (CH 3 COO) 2 Mg, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin and leupeptin).

A total of 60 cells were randomly selected for each sample and the mean value with standard deviation was reported. To compare the specificity of the aptamers interference of nuclear transport mediated by different sub-class of importins, we performed the above assay by replacing the KPNA2 either with KPNA1 or KPNA3 proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 245, "end": 249, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Binding analysis of aptamers"}, {"text": "To select an RNA aptamer against KPNA2, random RNA pool over a 60-nucleotide stretch flanked by a fixed 37-nucleotide primer region at the 5 0 end and 20nucleotide primer region at the 3 0 end was used. This randomized pool represents approximately 10 14 different species under our experimental conditions. For the initial selection, the N-60 RNA pool (3.0 mM) and mouse KPNA2 (0.43 mM) were mixed and incubated for 10 min in the presence of buffering agents and the free RNA was separated from the mouse KPNA2RNA complexes by filtration. The mouse KPNA2 bound RNAs retained on the filter were recovered in a hot 7 M urea solution and subsequently amplified by reverse transcription, PCR and in vitro transcription. To enrich specific aptamers during the selection process, in each selection cycle, competition between the individual sequences was allowed. For this, a high RNA pool to target protein ratio was used in the initial selection cycles. In the subsequent selection cycles (28), the ratio between the mouse KPNA2 protein and RNAs (pool RNA and tRNA) was manipulated to increase the selection stringency (Table 1) . To ensure selection of specific aptamers during the selection cycles, a non-specific competitor, tRNA, was used at different molar ratios. After eight rounds of selection cycles, RNA pools (1, 3, 5 and 8) were selected for the evaluation of enrichment of mouse KPNA2-binding aptamers and their specificity. The specificity and binding of RNA pools to the mouse KPNA2 was analyzed by filter binding assay at different concentrations (490, 980 and 1960 nM). The binding results show that the pool RNAs binding increased progressively with selection cycles and also the specificity to KPNA2, compared to the KPNA1 (Table 1) . No significant retention of the selected RNA pool occurred on the filter in the absence of mouse KPNA2, indicating that the non-specific filter binders were not co-isolated during the selection process. Approximately 17% of the 8 th RNA pool bound to mouse KPNA2 (Table 1 ). Since the 8 th selection cycle RNA pool bound specifically to the mouse KPNA2, we proceeded to the cloning and sequencing steps to evaluate the sequences in the pool. Individual aptamers from the eight cycles were classified based on the sequence similarity. We observed that aptamer 76 represented 22% of the population, whereas aptamer 72 and aptamer 21 represented 4% and 2%, respectively, in the selected pool of cycle 8. The secondary structures of these aptamers were predicted according to the MFold program (20, Fig. 1a ). Next, all three aptamers were evaluated with the filter assays for their binding ability to mouse KPNA2 (at concentrations of 246, 492 and 984 nM), in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of tRNA to avoid non-specific interactions with RNA. These filter binding assays showed that only aptamers 76 and 72 bound to mouse KPNA2, but aptamer 21 showed either minimal or insignificant binding to mouse KPNA1 (Fig. 1b) . In order to clearly evaluate that the sequence of 76 and 72 would be important, we performed another binding assay with unselected pool RNA (containing random sequences) and found that the unselected RNA pool had no binding ability even in the excess amount of mouse KPNA2 protein (1960 nM, Fig. 1b) .

One of the key components of this transport system is importin a, which initiates the process by recognizing the NLS within the cargo and importing macro proteins into the nucleus through the nuclear pores, as mediated by importin-b. Currently, seven importin-a proteins are grouped into three subfamilies. Despite their similarity, these proteins display remarkable specificity toward their cognate cargo proteins, which may decide the fate of the cell during differentiation, as observed in embryonic stem cells (9, 24) . The divergent roles of importin-a in the normal and in diseased cells scenarios have attracted much attention toward the development of ligands that specifically bind to a specific subfamily. In this study, we explored an in vitro selection strategy to identify aptamers from a completely random RNA pool that could bind specifically and efficiently as well as discriminate among subfamily members of importin-a. We executed a total of 8 selection cycles, which resulted in an enrichment of two aptamers, 76 and 72, as major and minor representation in the pool, respectively. These two aptamers bind efficiently (K d & 150 nM) to KPNA2-derived from either mouse or human. Moreover, both clones failed to bind to KPNA1 (Fig. 2b) .

The efficiency of interference for these two clones was observed to be the same, correlating well with their affinity towards human KPNA2. However, under similar conditions, random RNA sequences (pool RNA) showed no effects on nuclear transport activity mediated either by KPNA1 or KPNA2, or KPNA3, suggesting that the negatively charged surface of the aptamers had no major roles in binding to KPNA proteins. Nevertheless, structural analyses of the aptamer-KPNA2complex may reveal the specific binding site and shed light on their interference with KPNA2mediated nuclear transport. Interestingly, both aptamers failed to interfere neither the KPNA1-mediated nor KPNA3-mediated nuclear transport of cargo protein. Taken together these results suggest that the selected aptamers 76 and 72 are able to discriminate efficiently and block specifically the human KPNA2mediated nuclear transport (that belongs to the sub-family of importina1) from KPNA1 (that belongs to the subfamily of importina2) or KPNA3 (that belongs to the subfamily of importina3) (Figs 46) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 376, "end": 385, "text": "(Fig. 6a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1447, "text": "(Figs 46)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In short, this study identified two aptamers (76 and 72) that bound with a high affinity to mouse or human KPNA2 and were able to distinguish it from other subfamily members, such as KPNA1 and KPNA3.

We believe that these selected aptamers will have useful applications as new reagents for cancer diagnosis because many cancer cells and tissues are known to overexpress KPNA2 (1012).
