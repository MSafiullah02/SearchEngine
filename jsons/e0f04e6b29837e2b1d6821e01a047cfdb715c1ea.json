Our results outline strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected health care workers including virology testing and infection control measures. 3 Abstract Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory condition caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was initially detected in China in December 2019. Currently, in Germany over 140,000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital of M\u00fcnster (UHM). Methods: Single-step real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swaps was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and chart reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Threshold cycle (C t ) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Results: Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2 positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results. C t values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007).",

Semi quantitative real-time RT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.",

Recent studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [7] . While persistence of SARS-CoV-2 has been described on inert surfaces, person-to-person transmission via droplets is believed to be the main mode of transmission followed by an incubation period of five days on average before onset of illness [2, 7, 8] .",

For example HCW1 (index case) experienced fever on day 2 resulting in a low C t value when she was tested two days later. As many healthcare systems are facing the problem of reduced laboratory testing capacity, based on our results we are cautious to recommend testing asymptomatic contacts but would preferably monitor clinical key symptoms.
