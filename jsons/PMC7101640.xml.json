            "text": "Intestinal transplantation (IT) is the least common form of organ transplantation; however, it has shown exceptional growth and improvement in graft survival rates over the past two decades mainly due to better outcomes achieved during the first year of transplantation (76 % at 1 year), although rates of graft loss beyond 1 year have not improved [1]. Historically, intestine has been considered a non-transplantable organ due to large amount of lymphoid tissue included in the graft. With the development of better immunosuppressive management (cyclosporine in 1978 and tacrolimus in 1989) and enhancements in our understanding of the relationship between recipient and host immune systems [2], as well as improvement in surgical techniques and improved methods to prevent and monitor infections, the survival rate has improved. There are still ongoing issues with chronic rejection mainly due to the lack of knowledge and understanding of donor-specific antibody (DSA) development or early non-invasive detection of acute rejection [3].",

Intestinal failure is defined as the reduction of functional gut mass below the minimal amount necessary for digestion and absorption of adequate nutrients and fluids for survival and growth. IF occurs secondary to either anatomical or functional loss of a portion of the intestine. The leading cause of pediatric IF is short bowel syndrome (SBS) followed by dysmotility syndromes and mucosal enteropathies [4]. Approximately 15 % of children with intestinal failure develop life-threatening complications despite optimal medical and surgical treatment [5]; however, IF prognosis has improved dramatically in the past two decades through the development of new medical and surgical therapies and the introduction of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation programs (IRP) with an overall improvement on patient survival [6]. Mortality while waiting for transplantation is higher compared to other solid organ transplantation; therefore, early referral for assessment is critical to optimize outcome [7]. The purpose of this review is to describe the current status, indications, outcomes and advances in the field of intestinal transplantation.",

In a recent single center study published by Burghardt et al. in 2015, the 2001 criteria (advanced cholestasis, loss of >50 % central venous catheter (CVC) sites, 2 sepsis/year, ultrashort bowel) were compared in children with intestinal failure in the old era [1998\u20132005] (n = 99) and current era [2006\u20132012] (n = 91) to predict the need for IT using sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value (NPV and PPV). Two 2001 criteria demonstrated poor predictive value in contemporary patients\u2014advanced cholestasis (PPV 64 % old vs. 40 % current era; sensitivity 84 vs. 65 %, respectively) and ultrashort bowel (PPV 100 % old vs. 9 % current era; sensitivity 10 vs. 4 %, respectively. Three newly proposed criteria had high predictive value: >2 ICU admissions (p = 0.0001, OR 23.6, 95 % CI 2.7\u2013209.8), persistent bilirubin >75 \u03bcmol/L despite lipid management strategies (p = 0.0005, OR 24.0, 95 % CI 3.2\u2013177.4), and loss of >3 CVC sites (p = 0.0003, OR 33.3, 95 % CI 18.8\u201354.0). There was 98 % probability of needing IT when two of these new criteria were present (Table 2). These findings suggest it is time to revisit and revise the listing criteria for IT to reflect the changes in the natural history of pediatric intestinal failure that have occurred as a result of modern therapies [24].\n",

It is indicated in patients with irreversible IF without any significant liver disease. The isolated small bowel graft consists of the entire jejunum and ileum. The arterial inflow is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and the superior mesenteric vein drains the isolated small bowel graft. In the small bowel allograft recipient, gastrointestinal continuity is re-established by anastomosis of the proximal native and donor jejunum and the distal bowel is brought out as a Bishop-Koop or loop ileostomy with or without anastomosis to the remnant native colon (Fig. 3) [26]. Isolated intestinal transplant is preferred surgical option due to shorter waiting time and the graft can be removed if necessary without compromising other organs. There has been a significant trend toward IT without a liver component (Fig. 4) [1]. Traditionally, this option has been considered in patients with a non-adaptable diagnosis such as ultrashort bowel syndrome, or mucosal enteropathies such as tufting enteropathy or microvillus inclusion disease.\n",

In addition, they suffer intestinal failure and their remnant intestine has not demonstrated adequate ability to adapt and be independent of PN support. Typically, enteral calorie tolerance of <50 % at time of transplant assessment would suggest listing for a combined graft. Patients with tolerance of >50 % of their calories enterally at the time of development of liver failure are potential candidates for isolated liver transplantation. The first combined liver-intestine transplant was described in 1990 by Grant et al. [27]. In this type of transplant, the inclusion of liver/duodenum/pancreas is a way of preserving the hepatic hilus and biliary tree; therefore, there is no need for biliary reconstructive procedures, decreasing the risks for donor-related vascular or biliary complications [28] (Fig. 3). The proximal bowel is anastomosed end to end with recipient native jejunum at the Ligament of Treitz, and the distal bowel is brought out as an end ileostomy or anastomosed end to end with the recipient bowel, with creation of a proximal diverting loop ileosotomy. Alternatively, the liver and intestine can be transplanted as individual organs, without the pancreas graft, which has the advantage that if the intestine allograft should develop severe rejection, it could potentially be removed without requiring re-transplantation of the liver [29].",

There are no guidelines on how and when to start enteral nutrition, but the general consensus based on a survey conducted at major transplant centers, is to start enteral feeds within 3\u20137 days once the surgical ileus has resolved [32]. Early introduction of feeds is important to stimulate gut hormones, so the general rule is to initiate low volume feeds, reduced in fat and low in osmolality, and slowly increase volume until full feeds are reached. There is then a transition to bolus feeds. Formula preference, including polymeric or elemental feeds, varies between centers. Due to manipulation of lymphatics during the surgery, it is suggested to avoid long chain triglycerides until 4\u20136 weeks. As oral aversion is common in many of these patients, almost 45 % of patients depend on enteral tube feeding for nutritional support for the first 2 years after transplantation [33]. If a patient does not have oral aversion, the diet should consist of low fat, low simple carbohydrates and low osmolality. Most children achieve normal carbohydrate and protein absorption within 3 months after transplantation. Micronutrient optimization including zinc, iron and copper is required after IT [34]. Weight gain and vertical growth is achieved within the first 6\u201312 months.",

            "text": "The intestine is a highly immunogenic organ. Eighty percent of immune cells normally reside in gut and they are re-populated with recipient cells after transplantation; however, the genotype of the epithelium remains largely that of the donor, making the organ highly chimeric and immunogenic [35], with a higher likelihood of both acute and chronic rejection. Other than strict electrolyte and fluid management to maintain optimal organ perfusion in the immediate postoperative period, the main concern in the early postoperative course is the development of acute cellular rejection (ACR), which is a cellular and humoral immune-mediated allograft injury, that can occur in up to 50 % of patients and more frequently during the first 90 days post transplantation. Clinically, it can manifest in multiple ways including high stoma output, bloody diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain, amongst other symptoms and early recognition and treatment are crucial to ensure patient and graft survival. The exact mechanism of rejection is not yet well understood; however, there have been advances in the understanding of gut immunology during rejection, allowing better, targeted immunosuppression therapy. A recent study by Ningappa et al., demonstrated that among 107 differentially expressed genes, three B cell lineage-specific genes, CCR10, STAP1, and IGLL1, were down-regulated during ITx rejection and were selected for and achieved technical quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction replication. Down-regulation of the immunoglobulin (Ig)A+ plasma cell-specific CCR10 gene correlated with decreased mature mucosal CD138+ plasma cell numbers in corresponding biopsy specimens (r = 0.761, p = 0.006) and inversely correlated with enhanced allo-reactivity of CD154+ T-cytotoxic memory cells (r = \u22120.56, p = 0.031), that predict acute cellular rejection with high sensitivity, concluding that protracted depletion of the mucosal CD138+ plasma cell barrier and early mucosal infiltration with memory IgG+ cells characterize the rejection-prone intestine allograft and that mucosal IgA+ plasma cell barrier reconstitution may augment resolution of ITx rejection [36].",

Levels of less than 20 mmol/L are well correlated with the presence of ACR and levels <10 mmol/L might indicate moderate to severe rejection [39]. Calprotectin is found in neutrophil cytoplasm and can be detected in stools in the setting of active inflammation; however, in the setting of intestinal transplant it has significant inter-patient variability which makes it difficult to define a suitable \u201ccut-off\u201d value. Patients experiencing ACR have greater fluctuations in calprotectin levels than those without; however, routine stool calprotectin monitoring is not strongly supported [40].",

            "text": "Immunosuppression therapy is divided into an induction phase and maintenance phase. It has evolved greatly over the last 20 years. The first immunosuppressive agent used was cyclosporine which was associated with high rejection rates and fatal infectious complications. Outcomes changed greatly after the introduction of tacrolimus in 1990 [45]. Protocols vary amongst transplant centers, but since 2009 when electronic intestinal transplant registry data entry began, most patients (72 %) were induced with either an IL-2 blocker, an anti-lymphocyte product or monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody. The majority of current survivors (92 %) are taking tacrolimus as maintenance immunosuppression. Fifteen percent of the current survivors are also taking an mTOR inhibitor [1]. A literature review by Trevizol et al., showed 3 main protocols were used in major intestinal transplant centers between 2006 and 2010: Protocol 1\u2014daclizumab induction with tacrolimus and steroid for maintenance; Protocol 2\u2014alemtuzumab for induction and tacrolimus for maintenance treatment; and Protocol 3\u2014thymoglobulin and rituximab for induction and tacrolimus for maintenance. Protocol 2 showed the lowest rate of ACR of 34 % compared to 54 and 48 % for protocols 1 and 3, respectively. Protocols 1 and 2 showed infection rates of 62.5 and 52 %, respectively. One-year patient survival rates were 70, 79 and 81 %, respectively. Three-year patient survival rates were 62, 56, and 78 % for protocols 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Concluding that Protocol 3 (thymoglobulin and rituximab and tacrolimus) seems to be the best available one balancing ACR and infection rates (Fig. 5) [46]. Alemtuzumab has been associated with respiratory life threatening respiratory complications like ARDS in younger children, therefore should be used with caution in patients less than 4 years [47].\n",

Early detection and treatment with reduction of immunosuppression or combination of the latter and Ganciclovir in cases of high EBV viral load, has decreased the incidence of PTLD to 5\u201310 % [35].",

            "text": "Survival after IT has improved over the last decades due to advances in surgical technique and management of immunosuppression; however, due to the high incidence of rejection, it is thought that quality of life (QOL) after IT is poor. Few studies have addressed QOL after IT. Peroni et al. in 2012 published data from a preliminary cross sectional study assessing QOL on home parenteral nutrition and after intestinal transplantation using comparable questionnaires. The treatment-specific quality of life questionnaire for adult patients on home parenteral nutrition was adapted for intestinal transplant recipients. Both instruments were composed of 8 functional scales, 9 symptom scales, 3 global health status/quality of life scales and 2 single items. Intestinal transplant recipients showed a better score in following scales: ability to holiday/travel (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.022), gastrointestinal symptoms (p < 0.001), stoma management/bowel movements (p = 0.001) and global health status/quality of life (p = 0.012). A better score for ability to eat/drink (p = 0.070) and a worse score for sleep pattern (p = 0.100) after intestinal transplantation were also observed [53]. A recent study published by Andres et al. in 2014 aimed to determine Health related quality of life (HRQOL) after pediatric intestinal transplantation. Thirty-one IT survivors from 1999 to 2012 were asked to complete age-specific HRQOL non-disease-specific questionnaires: TAPQOL (0\u20134 year), Revidierter Kinder Lebensqualitatsfragebogen (KINDL-R) (5\u20137; 8\u201312; 13\u201317 year), and SF-36v2 (>18 year). The primary caregivers completed a SF-36 questionnaire and Caregiver Burden Interview (CBI). Highest scores were obtained for vitality (group I), self-esteem (group IV), and physical and social functioning and emotions (group V). Lowest scores were obtained in appetite and behavior (I), family and school (III), and chronic disease perception (III, IV). No significant differences were found between caregivers and their children. CBI showed stress in 52 %. SF-36 for caregivers was lower than the general population. No significant differences were found depending on relevant clinical and socio-demographic data. HRQOL was acceptable and improved with age and time since transplantation. It seems that parents have a slightly worse perception of their child\u00b4s health and also worse perception or their own QOL compared to the general population, and attention should also be paid to them. These results support the idea that when successful, intestinal transplantation allows a more normal life in most patients and can be offered as an attractive option, as patients are able to join society and perform age-appropriate activities and occupation [54].",

The incidence of re-hospitalization appears two to threefold more common after transplantation than for patients on PN; however, beyond the first year, the yearly cost of hospitalization and immunosuppressive medication is less after transplantation than the cost of continued PN. This suggests that, if a patient maintains a functional graft, intestinal transplantation becomes cost effective within 1\u20133 years after the procedure [55].",

It remains on the continuum of care for pediatric patients with intestinal failure, but bowel transplant rates have declined worldwide over the last 6 years, in large part due to the development of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation programs and the control of progressive cholestatic liver disease with novel lipid-based management strategies. With improved clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with intestinal failure, there is increasing evidence that the current indications for bowel transplantation no longer apply and need revision. The role of bowel transplantation may be changing in pediatric intestinal failure, but it remains an important option. All intestinal rehabilitation programs should have a close and fluid relationship with an intestinal transplant program to ensure early referral and assessment as necessary. The ultimate goal of management of patients with IF is to achieve enteral autonomy and wean PN, reduce mortality, minimize co-morbidity and optimize quality of life. Fortunately, most pediatric patients with IF will eventually become enterally autonomous due to inherent gut growth potential, but some may not, or may develop progressive complications and transplantation is most appropriate [56]. Unfortunately, there has been little advance in long-term survival related to chronic rejection, infection and PTLD. It is this obstacle where further research needs to focus.",
