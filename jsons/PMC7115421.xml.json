Early detection, understanding of the heterogeneity of this disease, and development of targeted therapies have played a major role in reducing breast cancer mortality rates during the last few decades [3], [4], [5]. Unfortunately, the clinical use of chemotherapeutics is often limited due to undesirable toxic effects [5], [6]. Side-effects are often caused by non-specific cell killing at an effective dose of drugs. One approach to overcome this problem may be the use of therapeutic agents at relatively low doses. However, a drawback of this approach is that the efficacy of therapeutics is often compromised at a low dose. We hypothesize that this problem may be overcome by sensitization of cancer cell killing by combinations of two or more different therapeutic agents that can induce synergistic cell killing in a tumor-specific manner [7].",

PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P], and PI(4,5)P2 to generate PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3, respectively [11]. This process is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor phosphatase-tensin homologue PTEN/MMAC [12], mutations of which are frequently found in human cancers [13], [14]. The PI3K-generated phospholipids function as second messengers to regulate Akt activity [15], [16], [17] by directly binding to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt [18]. This, in turn, results in the translocation of Akt proteins from the cytosol to the plasma membrane [19], where they are phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and 2 at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane [9], [20], [21]. The abnormality of the Akt1 isoform is often found in breast cancer and gastric adenocarcinomas, while Akt2 is frequently found amplified in ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancers [22]. Akt3 is amplified in breast cancer and prostate cancer cells [22].",

Inhibition of Akt alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents may enhance therapeutic effects by increasing programmed cell death, inhibiting cell division, and blocking angiogenesis [24], [25]. Unfortunately, inhibition of the PI3K pathway still cause substantial side-effects, mainly by non-specific effects [26], [27], [28], [29]. Blocking downstream players in the PI3K-Akt pathway at a low dose is likely less toxic, although the efficacy of such specific and narrow ranged inhibitors at a low dose may be lower than upstream inhibitors at a high dose [30]. We hypothesized that low doses of Akt inhibitors could be effective and safe if used in combination with appropriate chemosensitizers.",

In the combination with 0.4 \u03bcM of Akt inhibitor 8, CQ analog 5 showed 1.4\u20136.5-fold more efficient sensitization effects than CQ (i.e., 6.83/4.95 \u03bcM for MDA-MB468, 5.51/1.73 \u03bcM for MCF7, and 12.59/1.94 \u03bcM for MDA-MB231 in Table 1). Similarly, when combined with 3.5 \u03bcM of Akt inhibitor 9, CQ analog 5 is a more effective sensitizer than CQ on MDA-MB231 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines (Table 1 and Fig. 5B). Importantly, the combinations of CQ analogs 4 or 5 with Akt inhibitors did not kill non-cancer cells very efficiently at all (Table 1 and Fig. 5). In contrast to the CQ analog compound 5, CQ analogs 2 and 3 did not show any enhancement effects when combined with either Akt inhibitors 8 or 9 (Table 1). We note that the side chain of compound 5 is different from those of compounds 2 and 3, although all of them contain a basic 4-aminoquinoline backbone (Fig. 1). We also note that the side chains of CQ and compound 5 contain a dimethylamino group, while compounds 2 and 3 contain linear alkyl chain (butyl) group (Fig. 1). Our data thus suggest that the 4-aminoquinoline scaffold and lateral side chain of dimethylamino functionalities are important for CQ and its analogs for effective sensitization of cell killing by PI3K-Akt inhibitors.",

The sensitization enhancement by compound 5 is substantially better than CQ under the conditions employed in this work. We have also found that compounds 8 and 9 are more effective than LY294002 (compound 10) in killing breast cancer cells. Together, our data demonstrate that combinational therapies using low doses of certain CQ analogs (e.g., compound 5) and Akt inhibitors (e.g., compound 8 or 9) are very promising.

For a typical screening experiment, 5000\u201310,000 cells were inoculated into100 \u03bcl medium per well of a 96-well microtiter plate as described previously [39], [40]. Briefly, after the inoculation, the microtiter plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, 95% air and 100% relative humidity for 24 h, prior to addition of experimental drugs. Some of the sample wells were fixed with 25 \u03bcl of 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) as a control of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Tz). An aliquot of the frozen stock was thawed and diluted to the desired final maximum test-concentration with complete medium. Two- to ten-fold serial dilutions were made to provide a total of seven drug concentrations (and a control [C]). Following addition of drugs, the culture plate was incubated for additional 48 h. Cells were fixed in situ by slowly adding 25 \u03bcl of cold 50% (w/v) TCA (final concentration, 10% TCA), and were then incubated for 60 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, and the plate was washed five times with tap water, followed by air-dry. 50 \u03bcl of SRB solution at 0.4% (w/v) in 1% acetic acid was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for >30 min at room temperature. Unbound SRB was removed by washing the plate five times with tap water, followed by air-dry. The cells \u201cstained\u201d with SRB were solubilized with 10 mM trizma base, and the absorbance was read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515\u2013564 nm. Using seven-absorbance measurements [time zero (Tz), control growth (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)], the relative growth rate (%) was calculated for each of the drug concentrations according to the following formula:(Ti \u2212 Tz)/(C \u2212 Tz) \u00d7 100\n",
