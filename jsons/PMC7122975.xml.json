According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the USA, a trivalent vaccine is recommended from the age of 6 months for the 2017/18 epidemic season (Grohskopf et al. 2017). Unfortunately, the highest percentage of hospitalizations and deaths is recorded in infants <6 months of age (Zaw\u0142ocka et al. 2016). To protect newborns who are at high risk of complications after influenza infection, a cocoon vaccination strategy is recommended. People from the immediate infant environment, such as parents, grandparents, or siblings, are vaccinated against influenza, which protects the child against the illness in a secondary manner (Nitsch-Osuch 2017). The quadrivalent vaccines, which have been already developed, are recommended from the age of 3 years due to the lack of available research in younger children. This study seeks to define the prevalence of influenza infection in the population of children up to the age of 14 years and of the type of prevailing influenza virus causing infection among children during the 2017/18 epidemic season in Poland.",

The reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min). The obtained DNA was subjected to the initiating denaturation process (1 cycle at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min), followed by 45 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 10 s, and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 20 s.

Further, infection with subtype A/H3N2/constituted the lowest percentage of influenza A in each age group. This last trend seems to have been in line with the notion put forward by Adlhoch et al. (2018) suggesting that subtype A/H3N2/ may be the most common in older persons, particularly aged over 65 rather than in children. This report also demonstrates that unsubtyped influenza A was the most prevalent across all the age groups of children. This finding, however, may contain a spurious component due to possibly ineffective subtyping of influenza virus or occasional lack of subtyping it at all. Despite these limitations, we believe we have demonstrated in this report that there is a relation between the child\u2019s age and the type of influenza virus causing infection. In the 2017/18 epidemic season, the youngest children under 4 years were the most vulnerable to both influenza and influenza-like infections, the former caused mostly by influenza A and the latter by RSV. In contradistinction, influenza B dominated in the oldest children aged 10\u201314 and RSV infections were not present in this age group. However, characteristics of influenza viruses are highly changeable season to season. These data may thus not exactly apply to each and every epidemic season.",
