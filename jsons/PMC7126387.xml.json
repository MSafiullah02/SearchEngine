This is particularly evident in the contrasting virulence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains -JHM and -A59. Depending upon the protocol, MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 can be used as models for either acute encephalitis or chronic demyelination Haring and Perlman, 2001, Stohlman et al., 1998. In the absence of administered or maternal antibodies, intracranial inoculation of MHV-JHM results in fatal encephalitis even at low doses Fleming et al., 1986, Perlman et al., 1987, Phillips et al., 1999. Similarly administered, MHV-A59-infected mice develop a mild encephalomyelitis followed by chronic demyelination Fleming et al., 1987, Lavi et al., 1984. These differences in neurovirulence between MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 have been attributed to variations in their spike glycoprotein (S) (Phillips et al., 1999).",

In the case of the S protein, two subunits S1 and S2, respectively mediate receptor binding and cell fusion Kubo et al., 1994, Luo and Weiss, 1998, Taguchi and Shimazaki, 2000. The S protein of MHV-JHM (SMHV-JHM protein) is 1376 amino acids long, making up roughly 12% of the 32-kb MHV genome (Parker et al., 1989). The SMHV-JHM protein also contains the two known CD8 T-cell epitopes: S510-518 and S598-605 (Castro and Perlman, 1995). However, a 52-amino acid deletion within hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of MHV-A59 eliminates the immunodominant H-2b cytotoxic CD8 T-cell epitope S510; whereas the subdominant MHV-JHM epitope S598 is retained (Parker et al., 1989). In addition, the S protein possesses a number of B-cell epitopes Talbot and Buchmeier, 1985, Talbot et al., 1984. Previous studies have shown that the fatal encephalitis resulting from MHV-JHM infection can be ameliorated by antibodies directed against S, indicating that S is a critical component in neurovirulence Buchmeier et al., 1984, Fleming et al., 1986, Perlman et al., 1987.",

The inability of mice to resolve MHV-JHM infection was linked to delayed accumulation of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) mRNA transcripts and limited CD8 T-cell infiltration compared to MHV-A59 infection. IFN-\u03b3 production and CD8 T cells have been established as the two elements essential for MHV clearance (reviewed in Marten et al., 2001). Instead, MHV-JHM encephalitis was marked by early and sustained accumulation of interleukin (IL)-6, IFN-\u03b2, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 mRNA transcripts that coincided with a macrophage dominant infiltrate.",

We found that viral clearance and neurovirulence could be segregated on the basis of the non-spike and S genes. Infections with viruses containing the MHV-A59/Alb4 background (WTR13 and S4R22) were resolved, coincident with stronger IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression and a greater number of CD8 T cells within the brain, regardless of the origin of the S gene. The kinetics and level of the IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA accumulation also co-segregated with genes other than SMHV-A59 or SMHV-JHM. Despite the impaired viral replication, S4R22-infected mice exhibited enhanced mortality compared to MHV-A59 and WTR13 infections. However, critically morbid S4R22-infected mice had increased MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 mRNA accumulation and elevated macrophage levels within the brain reflective of MHV-JHM infection. Thus, it appears that the SMHV-JHM protein influenced neurovirulence through the induction of macrophage-driven immunopathology, not through enhanced viral replication in the CNS.",

To evaluate the impact of SMHV-JHM protein on CD8 T-cell infiltration, mice were infected with MHV-JHM, WTR13, and S4R22. Mononuclear cells were isolated from infected brains and stained with CyC-anti-CD8. Cell preparations from WTR13- or S4R22-infected brains indicated that there was at least a twofold increase in the proportion of CD8 T cells infiltrating into the CNS relative to MHV-JHM-infected brains (Fig. 2)\n. When the estimated number of CD8 T cells was calculated (refer to Fig. 2 legend), WTR13- and S4R22-infected brains were estimated to yield 3-fold and 10-fold more CD8 T cells, respectively, compared to MHV-JHM-infected brains. Thus, the SMHV-JHM does not appear responsible for the restricted CD8 T-cell infiltration in MHV-JHM-infected brains.",

Here, the ability of the S and non-spike proteins to induce immune elements unique to MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 infections using viral chimeras WTR13 and S4R22 was examined. Unexpectedly, it was found that genes other than S were critical in controlling viral titers and inducing IFN-\u03b3 and CD8 responses known to be protective in MHV infection (Marten et al., 2001). In contrast, the enhanced mortality due to the presence of the SMHV-JHM protein in MHV-JHM and S4R22 infections was associated with the up-regulation of MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 mRNA transcripts and increased macrophage infiltration into the CNS.

This is supported by a previous report (which also observed impaired S4R22 replication on day 5; Phillips et al., 1999).

Therefore, we directly evaluated the influence of the S protein on the two immunological elements demonstrated to be required for MHV clearance, CD8 T-cell and IFN-\u03b3 responses (Marten et al., 2001). The number of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brains was decreased twofold or more as compared to WTR13- and S4R22-infected brains (Fig. 2), indicating that the impaired CD8 infiltration observed in MHV-JHM-infected brain was independent of SMHV-JHM. Thus, the reduced CD8 T-cell number following MHV-JHM infection may reflect a non-spike gene which actively inhibits or induces apoptosis in CD8 T cells (Rempel et al., 2004) in a mechanism similar to the MHV E protein triggering of 17C1-1 cell apoptosis (An et al., 1999). Mononuclear cells isolated from infected brains were stimulated with either anti-CD3 which activates antigen-experienced T cells (Yee et al., 1994), or viral peptides. CD8 cells from MHV-JHM- and S4R22-infected brains produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to the two known CD8 epitopes S510 and S598 on the SMHV-JHM. However, the CD8 cell response from S4R22-infected brains (13.6%) was almost half that from MHV-JHM-infected brains (21.6%; Fig. 3B). As result, independent of SMHV-JHM or SMHV-A59, but in the presence of the MHV-A59 variant non-spike genes, the known epitopes accounted for a fraction of the total potential for IFN-\u03b3 production seen upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 3B), enhancing the support for critical CD8 epitopes on the MHV-A59 background. This greater number of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8 T cells may be responsible for the lower S4R22 titers at day 5 and the subsequent resolution of both S4R22 and WTR13 infections Fig. 3, Fig. 1. Therefore, genes other than S appear to have considerable influence over both the quantity and the quality of the CD8 T-cell response, perhaps involving an immunodominant epitope or a CD8 T-cell mitogenic element on the MHV-A59 background.",

In MHV-JHM-infected mice, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 transcript were reduced compared to WTR13 and S4R22 infections. Conversely, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA accumulation was sustained only throughout the course of MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 4), indicating that genes other than S regulated IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression. Many viruses have components that alter interferon activity including hepatitis C and Ebola viruses Basler et al., 2000, Song et al., 1999. Swine coronavirus M and E proteins are able to induce IFN-\u03b1 synthesis in compatible leukocyte populations (Baudoux et al., 1998), supporting the potential ability of non-spike MHV proteins, such as M and E, to influence interferon gene transcription. Moreover, our finding that non-spike genes appear responsible for the sustained level of IL-6 mRNA in MHV-JHM infection is collaborated by Zhang et al. (1998), who found that enhanced IL-6 mRNA accumulation could be attributed to the MHV-JHM hemagglutinin\u2013esterase gene. The increase in IL-6 message was associated with greater survival, not mortality, indicating that IL-6 transcription was controlled by specific viral elements like hemagglutinin\u2013esterase as opposed to being induced by a non-specific pro-inflammatory response resulting from high viral titers.",

            "text": "Unlike the lack of influence on CD8 T cells and IFN-\u03b3 responses, the SMHV-JHM protein clearly enhanced macrophage-associated responses within the brain (Fig. 5). MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 are chemotactic for macrophages and other leukocytes. The extent of clinical disease in S4R22-infected mice positively correlated with MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 mRNA levels. RNA samples from S4R22-infected mice with high disease scores, which mimicked IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-6 mRNA profiles from WTR13-infected mice (Fig. 4), here reflected MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 transcript accumulation in MHV-JHM-infected brains (Fig. 5A). This ability of discrete viral elements to specifically induce MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 mRNA concomitant with fatal neurologic disease was previously demonstrated with the insertion of an envelope gene from a neurovirulent oncornavirus strain into a non-virulent strain (Askovic et al., 2001). More specifically in MHV, the gene segment responsible for MIP-1\u03b1 production and virulence may be linked to a deletion in the SMHV-JHM protein found in the neuroattenuated MHV-JHM derivative V5A13.1, which induces elevated MIP-1\u03b2 mRNA, without similar increases in MIP-1\u03b1 transcript levels (Lane et al., 1998). A chemotactic target of MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2, macrophages are also critical in the development of CNS disease, including MHV-induced pathology Drescher et al., 2000, Wu and Perlman, 1999, Xiong et al., 1999. The potential impact of these chemokines on macrophage infiltration was directly evaluated by flow cytometric analysis (Figs. 5B and C). Cohort cells from MHV-JHM- and S4R22-infected mice with high disease scores exhibited an approximately threefold increase in the numbers of CD45 high/Fc\u03b3R high or CD45 high/CD11b high cells per brain as compared to WTR13 infections (Fig. 5C). It is unlikely that these markers describe either NK cells, since NK1.1+ cells were similarly present in MHV-JHM- and MHV-A59-infected brains (Rempel et al., 2004), or B cells, since a greater percentage of B220+ cells were observed in MHV-A59-infected brains than in MHV-JHM-infected brains (unpublished data, Rempel and Buchmeier). In S4R22 infections resulting in low disease scores, the proportion of macrophages is intermediate, confirming the ability of the SMHV-JHM protein to induce macrophage infiltration. However, estimates of the numbers of macrophages in these brains were noticeably lower than those from cohort mice with high disease scores. In contrast, the limited capacity of WTR13 to induce MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 transcripts or macrophage infiltration was not associated with clinical disease. Thus, the apparent ability of the SMHV-JHM to recruit macrophages into the brain, despite the absence of viral replication, appeared to be a source for the heightened morbidity and mortality associated with S4R22 infections. Whether the ability of the SMHV-JHM protein to induce MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 results from differences in tropism and/or the active induction of certain cellular genes within a population is a focus of future study.",

To obtain single cell suspensions, brains were ground between frosted slides and triturated with a wide bore pipette in RPMI (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone, Logan, UT). Cell suspensions at a final concentration of 30% percoll (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) were centrifuged at 320 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellets were washed and resuspended in 10% FCS/RPMI. Cells were underlayed with Lympholyte M (Cedarlane, Hornby, ON) and centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at room temperature. The resulting interface was collected and washed. Trypan blue exclusion was used to estimate the total number of viable cells isolated per brain. The total number of cells isolated per brain varied from about 150,000 to 750,000 depending on inoculation (Fig. 1B).",
