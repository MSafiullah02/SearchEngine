In young children there is generally involvement of other adjacent structures in the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tree; this condition is called acute laryngotracheitis, or croup. Acute laryngotracheitis may also extend into the lower respiratory tract presenting as acute laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB). Nearly all cases of acute croup are caused by viruses. In contrast, isolated tracheitis is rare and is more likely to be caused by a bacterium than a virus.",

LTB is a more descriptive term, but \"croup\" is more commonly used. Viral croup is the most common infectious cause of upper airway obstruction in young children. Infection involves the respiratory mucosa along the subglottic region. Anatomically, the subglottic diameter and circumference correlate with the age and size of the child. The smaller diameters make very young children prone to the obstructive process caused by infection-associated edema. The incidence of croup is highest among children between 3 months and 3 years of age. Outbreaks of croup typically occur in the fall and early winter just preceding the onset of RSV and influenza disease (. Fig. 7 .2). Parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3 account for nearly 80% of all cases (. Fig. 7 .3). Influenza A and B viruses can cause severe LTB and are more commonly associated with the development of secondary bacterial tracheitis and pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [1] .

Corticosteroid treatment is associated with a shorter duration of stay in the emergency department or in the hospital, if admitted, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer return visits to emergency departments. Most experts cur- rently recommend the use of dexamethasone which can be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly. Nebulized budesonide has also been used. Nebulized racemic epinephrine is also effective at achieving temporary symptomatic improvement in children with moderate to severe croup [4] .

The illness is characterized by wheezing, tachypnea, and respiratory distress that ranges in severity from \"the happy wheezer\" to respiratory failure. The term \"viral bronchiolitis\" is a diagnosis generally restricted to infants and very young children who present clinically with wheezing and tachypnea typically associated with other common signs of an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract including cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea.Bronchiolitis is one of the most common respiratory illnesses in children worldwide [5] . Outbreaks of bronchiolitis occur annually, and while the precise timing and overall severity of each year's outbreak vary from year to year, region to region, general seasonal patterns are quite predictable in much of the world. In temperate climates, outbreaks occur during the fall and winter months as respiratory viruses circulate throughout communities. In tropical and subtropical climates, the yearround baseline of disease activity tends to be higher than seen in temperate areas, with outbreaks of disease occurring during the rainy season. Limited data suggest that desert climates are associated with substantial bronchiolitis disease activity yearround.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis affects infants and young children, with a peak incidence occurring between 2 and 6 months of age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is, by far, the leading common cause of bronchiolitis, accounting for two thirds of cases. The second and third most common causes, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus type 3, account for more than half of the remaining cases. All of the other common respiratory viruses have potential to cause bronchiolitis as part of their potential spectra of disease, but each contributes to only a small percentage of total cases (. Fig. 7 .5) [6] . Bronchiolitis develops when a viral upper respiratory tract infection progresses to the distal lower respiratory tract. The early signs and symptoms of cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea, with or without fever, persist as the infant or child begins to wheeze and exhibit varying degrees of respiratory distress. The onset of wheezing and tachypnea heralds the development of lower respiratory tract involvement. Young children are particularly prone to bronchiolitis with wheezing because smaller airways are more prone to partial or complete obstruction when they become inflamed and filled with mucous. Shifting areas of local obstruction and mucous plugging results in air trapping that can usually be appreciated on chest radiography as hyperinflation and atelectasis (. Fig. 7.6) and is, at least in part, responsible for the diffuse wheezing heard on chest auscultation. Tachypnea, with respiratory rates of 100 breaths per minute or more, is not uncommon and will eventually impede the infant's ability to adequately feed. Oxygen saturation, as measured by pulse oximetry, can vary minute to minute due to shifting areas of mucous plugging and atelectasis that lead to varying degrees of ventilation to perfusion mismatch [7] . On clinical grounds, viral bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia are difficult to distinguish from one another since they represent a spectrum of lower respiratory tract illness that exist on a continuum. Accurately distinguishing between the two is not clinically important since the approach to patient management is the same. The pathophysiology of bronchiolitis originates from infection of the cells lining the terminal bronchioles. The infection causes direct cellular damage while also stimulating local host inflammatory responses. Virus-induced inflammation results in edema, mucus production, and the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Sloughing of dead epithelial cells into the inflamed, mucous-filled airway lumen leads to obstruction of the small airways.Most infants who develop bronchi- 1% 1% 1%",

Prematurity, low birthweight, chronic lung disease, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, and age less than 3 months are independent risk factors for severe disease, especially when bronchiolitis is caused by RSV. Children with exposure to cigarette smoke or other air pollutants, who live in crowded households and at high altitude, attend daycare, and have preschool-aged siblings, are also at risk for more severe disease.The ability of an infant to breast-or bottle-feed is a good indication of the clinical severity of their illness and should be observed if possible. Those who cough, struggle to breathe, or sputter during feeding should be considered for hospitalization. Infants with tachypnea above 60 breaths per minute and/ or oxygen saturations less than 92% should also be considered for admission.

The detection of parainfluenza viruses (PIV 1, 2, and 3, tan, orange, and light brown, respectively) was also seasonal, starting earlier in the fall. The detection of adenoviruses (AdV, dark green) and rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (rhino/EV, light blue) occurred throughout the year, without clear seasonal patterns.

If used, assess response 5 If no improvement in oxygen saturation or respiratory distress, discontinue use 5 If undesirable side effects are seen, such as excessive tachycardia or pallor, discontinue use 5 Glucocorticoid therapy 5 No convincing evidence to support routine use 5 Antimicrobial therapy 5 Oseltamivir can be considered for influenza virus-associated bronchiolitis 5 Secondary bacterial infections are uncommon, but when suspected antibiotics should be administered",
