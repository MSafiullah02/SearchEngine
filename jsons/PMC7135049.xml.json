Searching for a specific organism, Streptococcus pyogenes, as the causative pathogen is the most common infectious disease diagnostic effort performed on the oral cavity. The primary cause of most microbial pharyngitis is a virus in most adults; however, S. pyogenes, also known as the group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), is the most important organism to recognize. The inflammatory syndrome of the pharynx resulting from S. pyogenes infection is marked by a wide variety of signs and symptoms, and nearly always is accompanied by fever and sore throat.6, 35, 64 It is important for physicians to accurately diagnose which organism is causing the disease because infection with GABHS should be treated with antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, whereas viruses do not respond to such therapy. S. pyogenes also causes suppurative infections of the tonsils, sinuses, and middle ear, or cellulitis as secondary sequelae after an episode of pharyngitis. Treatment of GABHS pharyngitis is crucial because this can shorten the duration of symptoms and prevent the spread of the organism to other patients. It will also prevent the potential damage that S. pyogenes may cause to the heart and kidneys from rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, respectively.",

If the patient leaves their physician or healthcare facility with a prescription for antibiotics, the treatment would then begin before the microbial entity is known. In the age of emerging drug resistance, unnecessary antimicrobial agent use must be avoided. Because untreated GABHS infection may have serious consequences for the patient, rapid detection methods for S. pyogenes were developed to give nearly immediate results in order to make the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis possible while the patient is still in the office or clinic. There are several manufacturers of rapid identification test kits for GABHS in the marketplace today.34, 47, 52 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed 25 published studies that examined the sensitivity of these rapid identification test kits.18 They found the sensitivity of these tests ranged from 62% to 100%. Within any one institution, the sensitivity of a single kit varied by as much as 20%. Assuming that a good diagnostic screening test should have a sensitivity of at least 95% (so almost all infected patients will be detected), this study showed that a negative rapid identification test for GABHS cannot accurately rule out infection, and that a corresponding culture also is needed.18\n",

Fourteen different types of GABHS kits were assessed. The number of correct results ranged from 80% to 100%, with only three kits providing 100% accuracy for all participants. Those using these three kits comprised only 11% of the users. Based on this survey, and similar performance on previous CAP surveys, both the CAP and CDC recommend that a negative test result generated by a rapid identification test for GABHS must always be followed with a culture. This also is the current recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics. A useful approach is to collect two throat swabs, one for rapid testing and the other for culture. If the antigen test is positive, the second swab for culture is not needed. If the antigen test is negative, the second swab should be used to perform the culture. This approach can be an economic practice for an institution caring for a large number of children.",

This is because streptococcal pharyngitis is nearly exclusively a disease of 5- to 15-year-olds.6 Therefore, the chance of having a true positive screen test in an adult population is very low. As previously noted, the rapid, direct tests for S. pyogenes have a reported sensitivity ranging from 62% to 100%, with an excellent specificity of at least 95%; however, with a low GABHS prevalence adult patient population (\u22645%), a full 50% of positive tests would be false-positive results, even with a test that was 100% sensitive and 95% specific (5 true-positive and 5 false-positive patients for each 100 tested). This leads to additional prescribing of unnecessary antibiotics for patients, with the risk of a serious adverse reaction in someone who did not need treatment. A study of 806 community patients with an overall 25.1% prevalence of GABHS recovered by culture, published in 1990, supports this concern.52 Using a direct \u201crapid\u201d test did not add to a clinical evaluation, and compared to a well-done culture, it resulted in \u201cdelayed treatment, unnecessary treatment, and increased costs.\u201d Compared to culture, the rapid test only had a positive predictive value of 61% and a negative predictive value of 89%.",

With none of these signs or symptoms, only 2.5% of adults with pharyngitis will have a positive culture for GABHS. The optimal culture technique when streptococcal pharyngitis is considered likely is to thoroughly swab the palatine tonsils and oropharynx and avoid the tongue.

Epidemic diphtheria re-emerged in the former Soviet Union beginning in 1990, resulting in approximately 125,000 cases and 4000 deaths between 1990 and 1995. Although the number of new cases began to decrease in 1996, following a World Health Organization (WHO) strategy to vaccinate 90% of persons aged 3 years or older, cases are still being exported to Europe and other parts of the world.46 The introduction of new strains into the United States from exogenous reservoirs can cause outbreaks in homeless populations who are often in poor health and lack basic medical care.25 The laboratory diagnosis of diphtheria includes appropriate processing of a throat or nasopharyngeal swab. It should be inoculated to blood agar designed to detect \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, and to differential media for C. diphtheriae, such as tellurite agar and a Loeffler slant.56 Colonies appearing on the Loeffler's slant are stained with methylene blue to detect typical cellular morphology. Gray to black colonies on tellurite agar are confirmed as C. diphtheriae by biochemical testing, and further referred to a public health laboratory for toxigenicity analysis. Other Corynebacterium spp (C. ulcerans and C. pyogenes) can cause pharyngitis, with or without membrane formation or associated rash, but such infections are rare.",

This is most readily accomplished by use of serologic testing for the presence of heterophile antibodies (\u201cMonospot\u201d test) to diagnose acute EBV infection, or detection of IgM antibody directed against CMV for diagnosis of CMV mononucleosis.5 Use of accurate, rapid diagnostic tools can limit empiric antimicrobial agent therapy for pharyngitis and help reduce unnecessary use of these agents.23\n",

The bacteriology is similar in all of these situations, involving primarily anaerobic bacteria and streptococci.9, 54 A possible exception is perimandibular space infections that may also involve staphylococci and Eikenella corrodens in a relatively high percentage (15%) of patients. The streptococci are microaerophilic or facultative in growth requirements, and usually \u03b1-hemolytic. These are implicated in up to 30% of cases that are associated with a preceding dental infection. The B. fragilis group organisms are found in root canal infections, orofacial odontogenic infections, and bacteremia secondary to dental extraction in 5% to 10% of patients. Anaerobic cocci (both Peptostreptococcus and Veillonella), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas, the Prevotella oralis group, and Fusobacterium spp are found in about 20% to 50% of these conditions. Oral bacteria are clearly important in other dental processes, such as caries and periodontitis, but clinical laboratories are not traditionally involved in culturing in such cases. Typically, periodontal infections have been managed by mechanical cleansing and empiric therapy. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease process is leading to a greater recognition of the role of bacterial originating agents and the modifying role of host defenses.21 When periodontal disease develops, it appears that the local microflora are able to penetrate the gingival epithelium and bring about an inflammatory response. This inflammation significantly contributes to the subsequent destruction of the periodontium. Another recent report suggests that a direct smear of plaque taken from the subgingival area (showing numerous spirochetes), and even culture with susceptibility testing may be useful for a specific diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy.40 Such an approach to specifically target the microbial plaque is consistent with the most recent understanding of disease pathogenesis. The common microbial species for this infection are given in Table 1. This new approach is advocated based upon the evidence that specific therapy of anaerobic infection can be important for improved healing and a reduced need for surgery in the management of periodontal disease.40\n",

It not only results in direct morbidity and visits to physicians, but bacterial sinusitis is the most commonly recognized cause of subdural empyema, responsible for 56% of cases in a recent series.15 Other complications include local extension into the orbit and other bones of the skull, and development of chronic sinusitis. Most studies of the microbiology of acute sinusitis have dealt with maxillary infection because it is the most common type and the only one accessible for puncture and aspiration.63 Bacterial cultures should be positive in nearly three fourths of patients with acute sinusitis. In a study involving young adults, H. influenzae was recovered from 50% and S. pneumoniae from 19% of patients. Streptococcus pyogenes and M. catarrhalis were also found, in addition to normal skin flora such as Proprionibacterium acnes.

As expected, the oral flora is responsible for many of these locally invasive infections. Accordingly, the predominant organisms are anaerobes, primarily represented byPeptostreptococcus; various Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Actinomyces spp. Streptococci, chiefly of the viridans variety, also are important. When this infection develops in a hospitalized patient, S. aureusand various aerobic gram-negative bacilli are more likely the responsible pathogens.",

            "text": "Regarding specimen collection, the main problem in obtaining oral or dental infection material is to avoid, or at least minimize, contamination with oral flora that is always present in abundance. To properly diagnose oral infections, either collecting purulent material from a biopsy or needle aspiration (preferred when possible) or material on swabs designed for transport of microbial cultures should be obtained. For collection of material from an intraoral abscess such as a root canal infection, the tooth can be isolated by means of a rubber dam. A sterile field is established, and the area is swabbed with disinfectant. The specimen is obtained and placed into nonnutritive anaerobic transport medium. Alternatively, needle aspiration can be used if sufficient purulent material is present. Completely defining the flora of many such infections is beyond the scope of routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Specimens from neck space infections usually are obtained with a syringe and needle or by biopsy during an operative procedure. Transport must be under anaerobic conditions, as so many of these infections are due to anaerobes. Any swab, even those with calcium alginate-tips, can be toxic to some organisms. Even for aerobic bacteria, if transport is to be prolonged beyond 4 hours, some type of transport medium for the swab must be used to maintain viability. Because the oral cavity contains an abundant microbial flora, special testing procedures are often required. Table 1 reviews the major oral cavity infection syndromes, the pathogens responsible, and suggestions for optimal microbial detection. Routine culture swabs are adequate for recovery of adenoviruses and herpesviruses, and most bacteria and yeasts including C. diphtheriae, Mycoplasma, Candida spp, and Haemophilus spp; however, many of these pathogens require special processing, and thus, prior laboratory notification before specimen collection is highly recommended for optimal microbial detection. Nasopharyngeal swabs are better suited for recovery of respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria spp, and the viruses causing rhinitis.22 Modified Stuart's transport medium, as is often used in commercially produced swab systems, will preserve most viruses for a short time; however, nasopharyngeal swabs should ideally be transported in specially designed broth or other protein-containing fluid if they are not being cultured within a few hours. Recovery of C. diphtheriae is enhanced by culturing both throat and nasopharynx. Here, too, appropriate transport media should be used to preserve the microbe's viability. Aspirated nasopharyngeal secretions collected in a soft rubber bulb are the best specimens for B. pertussis. If this is impossible, transport for less than 2 hours in 1% casamino acid medium is acceptable.26, 31\n",

Plain Gram's crystal violet can be used to identify the agents of Vincent's infection. Direct smears of exudate from membrane-like lesions, used to differentiate diphtheria from other causes of such membranes, are unreliable and not recommended. Fungal elements, including yeast cells and pseudohyphae, may be visualized with a 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, with calcofluor white fluorescent stain, or with a periodic acid\u2013Schiff stained slide.

This is done because sheep blood does not support growth of potentially confusing \u03b2-hemolytic bacteria like Haemophilus haemolyticus and H. parahaemolyticus. The use of a sheep blood agar plate for isolation of S. pyogenes needs overnight growth for adequate colony formation and then further manipulations of any \u03b2-hemolytic growth for definitive identification. If sufficient numbers of pure colonies are not available on the primary culture plate, a subculture requiring additional growing time is necessary. New selection agars have been developed that suppress the growth of almost all normal flora and \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci except for groups A and B, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum.\n62 By placing a 0.04 unit differential bacitracin filter paper disk directly on the area of initial inoculation, presumptive identification of S. pyogenes can be made after overnight incubation if heavy growth occurs. A probe test was released for commercial use in 1992 (Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, CA) that provides highly sensitive and specific results following a 4-hour incubation step in selective media. The cost of this genetic-based test is its primary drawback. Also, with the probe-based tests there is no organism recovered. Although not currently routine, susceptibility testing of a recovered S. pyogenes is likely to become more important in the future, as several areas are now recognizing increasing resistance to erythromycin in this important pathogen.",

To grow this organism, freshly prepared Bordet-Gengou agar is the medium of choice for isolation of B. pertussis, and therefore, prior notification of the laboratory is needed when a suspected case of either diphtheria or pertussis occurs, as they would not be recovered on routine media available in most US microbiology laboratories.4 Interestingly, a modified medium designed for isolation of Legionella spp, buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with 3 \u03bcg/mL lincomycin and 80 \u03bcg/mL anisomycin, has been shown to yield good recovery of B. pertussis. Jones and Kendrick31 have also reported excellent recovery on a blood-free medium containing charcoal, heart infusion base, 2% agar, and 0.3 U/mL penicillin. The charcoal medium developed for Legionella spp is more readily available and is thus a useful substitute for many clinical laboratories. Specimens should be plated directly onto media, if possible, because the organisms are extremely delicate.

Long ago, it was recognized that infectious endocarditis was associated with pathogenic bacteria that are often part of the normal flora of the human mouth.53 Detection of bacteremia, including that associated with endocarditis, requires appropriate culture of blood. Published standards exist for optimal blood culture practices in adults. These indicate that 2 to 3 sets in a 24-hour period, each consisting of 20 to 30 mL (for a total of 60 mL), maximizes detection of bacteria in the blood stream.3, 12, 65 A recent review also found that oral infection can result in distant infection at several unexpected sites.48 Not only did the authors find expected infections, such as brain abscess, osteomyelitis, and mediastinal abscess due to Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, streptococci, and Peptostreptococcus spp, but also hepatobiliary infection from Actinomyces spp, Fusobacterium spp, and oral streptococci.48 In patients with solid tumors or leukemia, when fever develops in the presence of granulocytopenia (<100 granulocytes/mm3), oral lesions are present in a majority of the patients (>70%), and often this is the only source site of potential bacteremia recognized.45 During and after immunosuppression, the microbial flora in the mouth can harbor such diverse pathogens as C. albicans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans, HSV, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, H. influenzae, Acinetobacter spp, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

            "text": "Our knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of infections relative to the oral cavity is rapidly expanding, similar to our overall understanding of how infectious diseases impact our daily lives. The complexity of the flora within the oral cavity is quite unique and often makes diagnosis difficult; however, it is becoming more apparent that accurate diagnostic testing is important from the standpoint of focusing appropriate therapy on pathogens within this crucial body site, and avoiding overuse of antimicrobial agents in settings of infection where they have no demonstrated benefit. New diagnostic methods are being developed to detect pathogens and rapidly delineate resistance patterns. Many will be based on new genetic assays, but they must be cost effective, sensitive, and specific.14 Another growing challenge is to provide adequate lab support to outpatient offices and clinics, without compromising the specimen culture or turnaround times. So many patients are being seen away from hospital laboratories that we need ways to diagnose sinusitis, pharyngitis, abscess, and other infections of the oral cavity without killing the anaerobes and other significant facultative bacteria, and without ruining the direct stains by overgrowth or inflammatory cell degradation during specimen transport. These results need to be available quickly enough to give useful information for office diagnosis in order to effect therapy. To optimize both diagnosis and treatment, a key to the future will be better communication between the clinical practitioner and laboratory, with an increasing emphasis on training expertise in medical microbiology and infectious diseases.",
