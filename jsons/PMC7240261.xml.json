It was initially developed as an anti-malarial but its mass use led to the serendipitious discovery of its anti-inflammatory action.1 Chemically, it is an alkylated 4-aminoquinolines (4-AQ), hydroxyl derivative of 7-chloro-4(-4-diethylamino-1-methyl butyl amino) quinolone,2 which is used as a disease modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of various inflammatory and connective tissue disorders. The exact mechanism of HCQ toxicity is unknown, but it is considered owing to 4-aminoquinoline nucleus of the chemical.3 Its toxicity is a dose and duration-dependent definite phenomenon rather than an idiosyncracy. Binding of HCQ to lysosomes and endosomes via inhibition of activation of toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9). It raises intraorganelle pH leads to ineffective degradation and storage of these toxic products and eventually cell damage. The toxic effects are due to accumulation of proteins ubiquinated by 4-AQs, which causes apoptosis, autophagy disruption, and oxidative damage.",

In Asian patients, perifoveal and further peripheral involvement, which might me missed in central 10\u20132 fields, warrants VFA 24\u20132 or VFA 30\u20132. Perifoveal and extramacular involvement is not exclusive in Asians and is seen in 12% Asian population and 2% Caucasian population.2 It should be emphasized that these patterns have only 4 central test spots representing central macula and reduced sensitivity even in 1 central spot is abnormal. The visual fields are highly variable, but when reliable, it provides an excellent tool to detect toxicity in perifoveal and extrafoveal areas. The parafoveal visual field defect involves 2\u20136 degrees of central field and perifoveal visual field defects may not be detectable in 10\u20132 visual field testing. The most commonly affected inferotemporal macular region in HCQ toxicity extrapolates as a superonasal field defect. If VFA is uncertain, it should be retested or other objective tests should be considered. About 10% patients have visual field abnormalities with normal SD-OCT. In such conditions, repeating the visual fields or mf-ERG is considered to detect any evidence of structural damage.",

Recent recommendations of use of HCQ for treatment of cases and prophylaxis in COVID -19 contacts and involved health-care workers makes it imperative to revisit the dreaded irreversible adverse effect of the drug on central visual acuity due to maculopathy. The literature and clinical experience have proven without an iota doubt that exposure to systemic use of HCQ is a risk factor for toxic retinopathy, which is irreversible, and when advanced, can lead to permanent loss of central visual acuity. The screening for retinopathy will detect the earliest abnormalities associated with HCQ retinopathy and provide us with a fair idea about- \u2018if to stop\u2019, \u2018when to stop\u2019.

The role of VFA 30\u20132 or 24\u20132 is valuable in detecting these defects in absence of SD-OCT findings and can be confirmed by other objective tests such as mf-ERG. Our study also found SD-OCT based macular defect in a case using HCQ at a dose 4 mg/kg/day and a case of definite retinopathy in duration of 1 year. Thus, a study with larger sample size or multicentric study is recommended to study the impact of dose and duration on prevalence of HCQ maculopathy in Indian population where a dose of 400 mg daily might often exceed recommended daily dose of less than 5 mg/kg/day.",

VFA which establishes functional defect is complementary to SD-OCT for definite diagnosis but it is time-consuming, cumbersome, and at times unreliable. This study reflects the need of incorporating wide-field OCT or mf-ERG to detect objective changes in the screening protocol for Indian population, as the gap in the knowledge still exists about prevalence of parafoveal, perifoveal, and extrafoveal maculopathy among HCQ users.",
