Nevertheless, LRA requires a collaborating, not anxious patient, without language barrier. Intra-abdominal pressures have to be maintained low, in order to reduce chest discomfort and shoulder pain due to the diaphragmatic irritation caused by pneumoperitoneum [28] . Trendelenburg positioning should be minimized. In cases requiring an increased intravenous sedation, the combined effect of LRA, pneumoperitoneum and intravenous drugs may lead to severe hypotension, hypoventilation and hypoxemia [29] . Moreover, urinary retention could be a LRA serious disadvantage, in some cases requiring urinary catheterization [28] .",

During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemics, SA could be useful in reducing the need for invasive procedures on respiratory tract, limiting contamination risk. We included short operating time procedures under locoregional or general anaesthesia and we conducted a prospective cohort study, mimicking clinical decision-making in real-world contexts [30] . Strengths of our study include its prospective design and the sample size calculation. Our results, however, cannot be generalized because of the selective inclusion of women with benign adnexal conditions and the lack of randomization. Further studies should evaluate patients' satisfaction after LRA.",
