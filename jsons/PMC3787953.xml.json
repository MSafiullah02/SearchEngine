            "text": "An influenza pandemic poses a serious threat to humans and animals, and it has incurred great financial and societal cost for decades. The most common pathogens causing influenza in humans are type A influenza viruses (seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1 and H3N2) and type B influenza viruses. Conventional treatments against the disease include two classes of antivirals: M2 ion channel blockers adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir and laninamivir) (Ison, 2011, Lee and Yen, 2012). These two categories are designed to target viral proteins, thereby interfering with the virus\u2019 infection mechanisms. However, the emergence of new influenza viral strains carrying drug resistant mutations that can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals presents a major clinical challenge. Most circulating influenza A viruses show resistance to adamantanes (Ison, 2011, Jackson et al., 2011, Lee and Yen, 2012, Moscona, 2009), and intrinsic resistance to the compound has also been observed in Influenza B (Ison, 2011). In addition, beginning with the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses possessing the oseltamivir resistance mutation (His275Tyr) have been observed (Lackenby et al., 2008). Since the first reported case of pandemic H1N1 in 2009, oseltamivir-resistant variant strains have also been identified (Baz et al., 2009, Leung et al., 2009, Speers et al., 2010, Storms et al., 2012). The rapid development of antiviral resistance highlights the need for alternative therapeutic strategies.",

Vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) activity, which is responsible for pumping protons into endosomal compartments, has been identified as a requirement for influenza virus replication in previous studies (Guinea and Carrasco, 1995, Muller et al., 2011, Perez and Carrasco, 1994). V-ATPase-encoding genes have also been identified in several genome-wide screens for host factors regulating influenza virus replication, and the knockdown of v-ATPase subunits has been shown to result in significant inhibition of influenza virus replications (Chin and Brass, 2012, Hao et al., 2008, Karlas et al., 2010, Konig et al., 2010, Mehle and Doudna, 2010). Blocking v-ATPase activity, therefore, presents an opportunity to impede influenza infection by preventing the low pH-dependent membrane fusion between endosomes and virions. In addition to influenza viruses, flaviviruses (Pierson and Diamond, 2012), vaccinia viruses (Townsley et al., 2006), rhabdoviruses (Albertini et al., 2012), and coronaviruses (Belouzard et al., 2012) also enter target cells in a pH-dependent fashion.",

Therefore, imaging and quantification of GFP fluorescence based on fluorescence imaging can be used to evaluate the extent of virus entry and replication. As seen in Fig. 4\nA, with the reference of the DAPI-stained nuclei, GFP produced from virus replication was observed to localize in the cytoplasm. GFP fluorescence was reduced with pretreatment of bafilomycin A1 or increased concentrations of diphyllin in MDCK cells. Through quantification of GFP fluorescence, the relative intensity from test wells demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in the presence of diphyllin. The dose\u2013response curves of GFP intensity found in diphyllin-treated MDCK and A549 cells are shown in Fig. 4B.",

            "text": "Diphyllin is one of the newly discovered v-ATPase inhibitors (Huss and Wieczorek, 2009). By including an old v-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, as a control in two key functional assays, a similar cellular mechanism of action between diphyllin and bafilomycin A1 was observed. A wide variety of structurally inhibitors have been discovered, including benzolactone enamides salicylihalamide, lobatamide A and B, apicularen, indolyls, oximidine, macrolactone archazolid, lobatamide C, cruentaren, diphyllin and recently reported synthetic compounds, such as FR202126 and SB 242784 (Huss and Wieczorek, 2009, Niikura, 2006, Perez-Sayans et al., 2009). Many of these v-ATPase inhibitors have been previously evaluated for their antiviral activity against influenza viruses (Guinea and Carrasco, 1995, Muller et al., 2011, Ochiai et al., 1995), rhinoviruses (Suzuki et al., 2001), and dengue viruses (Duan et al., 2008). Even though some of the classical v-ATPase inhibitors exhibited potent inhibitory effect against influenza viruses, the high toxicity of these compounds made them unsuitable for clinical applications (Drose and Altendorf, 1997, Niikura, 2006). In Muller\u2019s study (2011), for instance, bafilomycin A1 showed limited therapeutic efficacy in vivo despite significant viral inhibition in vitro. Implicated to have an unselective action mechanism, bafilomycin A1 exhibited high toxicity and inflicted liver and spleen damages at a 350 ng/kg. In contrast, a structurally distinctive saliphenylhalamide, demonstrated effective in vivo antiviral effect in mice and was well tolerated at a dose of 7 mg/kg. The improved antiviral effect/toxicity profile of saliphenylhalamide was attributed to a more selective v-ATPase inhibiting mechanism and highlights a major factor for consideration in therapeutic applications of v-ATPase inhibitors. Regarding diphyllin in the present study, compound safety has been demonstrated in a previous report (Shen et al., 2011), in which daily treatment in mice at a dose of 20 mg/kg was tolerated for 10 days without significant signs of toxicity. Structurally, both saliphenylhalamide and diphyllin fall into the class of benzolactones. It should be noted, however, that saliphenylhalamide is a lactone of salicylic acid, and diphyllin is a lactone of naphthoic acid, and saliphenylhalamide contains a macrocyclic N-acyl enamine functional group that has been shown to be required for potent v-ATPase activity (Lebreton et al., 2008), whereas diphyllin has no such functional group. Owing to the multiple isoforms of v-ATPase expressed in a tissue-specific manner (Toei et al., 2010), the therapeutic usefulness of v-ATPase inhibitors relies on the selectivity in the inhibition (Niikura, 2006). Although the tissue or isoforms specific inhibition of diphyllin has yet been determined, diphyllin in this study demonstrates a safe therapeutic window in two types of mammalian cell lines with IC50 values against viruses in the nanomolar range (38\u2013632 nM), and the cellular cytotoxicity in the micromolar range (3\u201324 \u03bcM), suggesting a potential role for further in vivo studies. We believe broad-spectrum antiviral agents of high potency and low toxicity may be further developed through the existing compounds or derivatives.",

In this study, besides the laboratory H1N1 strain A/PuertoRico/8/34 (PR8) which is resistant to amantadine (Scholtissek and Faulkner, 1979) (had a IC50 of amantadine higher than 22 \u03bcM), we tested avian influenza A (H6N1) virus and five more types/subtypes of virus strains (Table 1), including an H1N1 oseltamivir-resistant clinical isolate A/San Diego/21/2008 (had a IC50 of oseltamivir higher than 40 \u03bcM). The results clearly showed that diphyllin demonstrated CPE protection and inhibited influenza viral replication against multiple types/subtypes, including the drug-resistant strains. To further investigate the spectrum of antiviral activities of diphyllin, we extended use of diphyllin to the context of dengue virus, another emerging human pathogen that shares a similar pH-dependent virus entry mechanism as influenza viruses (Pierson and Diamond, 2012). The results showed that diphyllin interfered with dengue virus replication in cells, supporting the notion that diphyllin possesses a host-targeting, strain-independent mechanism of inhibition. Also, multiple methods were used in this study to evaluate diphyllin\u2019s effect, including the assay of infectivity, investigation of viral mRNA transcription by qRT-PCR and protein expression by Western blot, examination of GFP expression as a surrogate read-out for virus replication, CPE protection, and quantification of extracellular virus particles using HA tests, all of which corroborated the antiviral effect of diphyllin.",

            "text": "The combinatorial effect of diphyllin was also studied by combining a commercially available NA inhibitor (oseltamivir) or an M2 ion channel blocker (amantadine) with diphyllin. The combination of diphyllin and amantadine showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on both the virus expression and the CPE protection. Given that amantadine functions by inhibiting a proton-pump on viral antigens (Ciampor et al., 1992), thereby regulating vesicular pH in an analogous fashion to diphyllin, the cooperativity between amantadine and diphyllin is presumably due to a more complete inhibition of endosomal acidification that occurred when the two drugs were combined. On the other hand, since diphyllin takes effect at an early stage of the replication cycle (virus fusion/uncoating) while oseltamivir takes effect at a later stage of the replication cycle (release of virons from infected cells), combining these two drugs was hypothesized to result in a synergistic action. As expected, viral protein expression and HA titer were significantly reduced when combinations of these two drugs were given as compared to single-drug treatments. Enhanced activity of oseltamivir on CPE protection was also observed in combination with diphyllin. It was reported that cell-based assays had less advantages than the direct enzymatic measurement of NA for monitoring susceptibility to the NA inhibitors (Tisdale, 2000). In our experimental setting, however, we aimed to compare the combinatorial effect of diphyllin with the NA inhibitor, rather than to measure the susceptibility of viruses to certain NA inhibitors. Moreover, due to the different sensitivity of assay methods utilized in this study, the doses of compound combinations were pre-optimized to reflect a dynamic range that demonstrated appreciable interactions between the different compounds. For instance, higher doses of compounds were used in the Western blot and the HA test from Fig. 7A as compared to those used in the CPE assay from Fig. 7B.",

In addition, antiviral effect of amantadine has been demonstrated in equine influenza (Timoney, 1996, van Maanen and Cullinane, 2002), and it possesses therapeutic value in veterinary medicine. As influenza viruses undergo rapid mutations and it is difficult to predict the drug sensitivity of the new generation of viruses, drug combinations with diphyllin or other v-ATPase inhibitors present a valuable strategy to help combat antiviral resistance.",
