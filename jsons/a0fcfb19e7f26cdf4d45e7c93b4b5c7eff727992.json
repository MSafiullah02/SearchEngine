We usually do not know the actual number of infections. During the initial phase of the outbreak, PCR based tests could only detect an active infection. So, we do not consider the Infection compartment as usually done in classical SEIR model. Rather we defined the compartment as 'Identified spreaders', a variable that can be reliably evaluated, simply because the primary data usually available publicly is the number of cases appearing each day. Note that, these numbers do not represent the total number of infections or total number of spreaders, but only the number of persons who have been tested. The reported number of identified cases is also highly dependant on the degree of testing performed by a medical system. This model considers a parameter quantifying the probability of a disease spreader to be identified. In a practical scenario, this probability is likely to be high when there is pro-active testing. Moreover, it considers parameters accounting for social isolation assuming that, an identified spreader would be rigorously quarantined and would thus contribute significantly less in spreading the epidemic.",

Models, where individuals move from one subpopulation \"compartment\") to another, are also referred to as 'compartmental models'. Most classical epidemiological models include E for an exposed group, which means that our model slightly deviates from standard models. We deliberately avoided a larger model with more variables. The current coronavirus pandemic has revealed various problems with data generated. The larger the size of the model, the greater the risk of making it unidentifiable. The predictions arising from SEIR type epidemiological models also tend to be sensitive to changes in parameter values. Taken together, during the current crisis numerical predictions of case numbers and specific times (e.g. of peaks) has been difficult. As a consequence, we here focus on a simple model that does not try to focus on values and time points. Instead, the goal is to investigate general pattern and scenarios.

The average duration of illness is assumed to be 14 days Bjoernstad et al Nature April 2020 [1] . For the SIR model, the relationship between \u03b2 and \u03b3 is the reproduction number R = \u03b2/\u03b3. The basic reproduction number R(0) represents how many new infections are caused at the start of an epidemic by a spreader. Note that this estimation of R(0) also holds for our SUIR model. The reason behind is that, the sum of the compartments U and I essentially is essentially same as the compartment I SIR representing spreaders in the SIR model. The chance of transmission is directly proportional to the contact frequency, i.e., how many close contacts a person makes on an average per day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the reproduction number has been adopted in several countries as a criteria for lifting contact restrictions measures. For the estimation of R(t) several methods exist and depending on how it is calculated, the estimates can differ quite considerably. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has estimated R(t) as the quotient of new daily infections in two successive four day windows. The model from Michael Meyer-Herrmann from the Helmholtz Centre, Braunschweig, also used a sliding window, of seven days, but also included a model in the estimate of R(t) [4] .",

We note here that even exercising a double lockdown period to that of Strategy 1 and then a gradual exit also might not be enough to prevent future relapses, if we assume that the virus retains the same spreading potential and there is a low degree of pro-active testing. We thus conclude that there is a chance that the pandemic might relapse, within the year after lifting of a short or long lockdown, whether the lockdown is lifted abruptly or gradually, if we assume that the virus retains the same spreading potential and pro-active testing is not boosted up.

In this case we see that even if there is short lockdown and an abrupt exit, a high pro-active testing index of .7 can prevent the pandemic from relapsing. Recall here that pro-active testing should not be confused with random testing. That is, \u03c1 = 0.7 does not mean randomly testing 70 percent of the population. Rather it means implementation of testing strategies that can ensure that 70% of the spreaders are detected. (See Figure 7) This can be done by:",
