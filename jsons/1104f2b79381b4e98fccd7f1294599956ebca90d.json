The best examples are the recurring outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya fever in tropical and sub-tropical regions, the recent epidemic of Zika in the Americas and the Caribbean, and the SARS, MERS, and influenza A outbreaks across the globe. The established natural reservoirs of human viruses are mainly farm animals, and, to a lesser extent, wild animals and arthropods. The intricate \"host-pathogen-environment\" relationship remains the key to understanding the emergence/reemergence of pathogenic viruses. High population density, rampant constructions, poor sanitation, changing climate, and the introduction of anthropophilic vectors create selective pressure on host-pathogen reservoirs. Nevertheless, the knowledge and understanding of such zoonoses and pathogen diversity in their known non-human reservoirs are very limited. Prevention of arboviral infections using vector control methods has not been very successful. Currently, new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected >8,000 people, causing 774 deaths in 27 countries [4] .",

It is estimated that zoonotic infectious agents constitute about 60% of the known human pathogens and up to 75% of \"emerging\" human pathogens [14] [15] [16] . We have, however, limited knowledge of such zoonosis and the diversity of these viruses in their known reservoirs. The data on some of the domestic mammals harboring dozens of virus species is limited and we have insufficient knowledge about the wild animals that are estimated to host thousands of virus species [17] . 3 the deadly outbreak of MERS-CoV was linked to its zoonotic origin because of its close genetic homology to bat CoV, but not to any other known hCoV [18] . Current data shows that bats harbour the greatest diversity of CoVs, which vary from species-to-species and region-toregion [19] . The lyssaviruses of Rhabdoviridae are zoonotic human pathogens that cause fatal encephalitic disease. In addition, European bat lyssavirus type-1/-2 (EBLV-1/-2), Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) [20] , and Australian bat lyssaviruses (ABLV) have been implicated in human fatalities [21] [22] [23] . Rabies virus (RABV), the archetypal lyssavirus, is historically one of the most dreaded viruses, with zoonotic potential in dogs, cats, and ferrets, and includes other domestic and wild mammals [24] .",

Notably, ZIKV was known as a neglected tropical disease confined to Africa and Asia until an outbreak was reported in 2007 on Yap Island and in 2013/2014 on islands in the Pacific, thus expanding its geographical territory [30, 31] . WNV remains the most important mosquito-borne encephalitis pathogen in North America, involving Culex sp. and the American Robin in its transmission cycle. Since its emergence in the West in 1999, it has undergone adaptive genetic changes as it spreads throughout North America [32] . Furthermore, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is considered to be one of the major emerging diseases spreading to and within the European nations, following the expanding distribution of anthropophilic ticks [33] . Every year, >1,000 cases of CCHFV, due to human-tohuman transmission, are reported in southeastern Eu-rope, including Turkey. SFTSV, a previously unidentified tick-borne bunyavirus, has recently emerged in China with fatality rates as high as 30% [34] .",

Owing to their error-prone polymerase/reverse-transcriptase (approx. 10 -4 /site/replication cycle) that seems to operate at optimal fidelity, RNA viruses exist as more genetically diversified populations than DNA viruses. Nevertheless, of the hitherto recognized 158 species of human RNA viruses consisting of 47 genera and 17 families, only a minority has adapted to humans [38] . In contrast, of the known 91 DNA virus species with 22 genera and 8 families, nearly 87% are adapted to human hosts [38] . In the human-adaptation process, the viral genetic mutations, re-assortment or virus-host genetic recombination might lead to the establishment of stable virus lineages in human populations. It is, therefore, quite possible that such human-adapted viruses could circulate asymptomatically and remain undetected until their novel clinical manifestations are noticed. To understand this further, a recently isolated HEV genotype 3 from a chronic hepatitis E patient containing a recombinant virus-host RNA genome was shown to infect cultured human, pig, and deer hepatocytes [39] .",

Humans are, therefore, no more than \"incidental\" or \"spillover\" hosts for pathogens.

The field of phylodynamics, combining a modeling framework for host, epidemiological, and molecular data, especially for RNA viruses, shows particular promise for Parvez understanding the patterns of viral evolution during epidemics [40, 41] . Moreover, our underappreciated aspect of growing human populations, global changes in land usage, and the introduction of anthropophilic vectors create selective pressure on hosts and reservoirs. For example, both WNV and CHIKV evolved rapidly after being introduced to new locations and encountering new vectors. When Aedes albopictus rather than A. aegypti became the main vector of CHIKV in the Indian subcontinent after the 2004-2009 epidemic, the same viral strain spread rapidly, and the subsequent mutants seemed to circulate and persist more efficiently [42] . A unique molecular signature of the CHIKV epidemic was a single amino acid substitution (A226V) in the envelope protein (E1). This mutation was identified in 90% of the strains reported during the later phase, and was associated with a high epidemic potential for CHIKV [43] . ZIKV, initially known to be transmitted by mosquitoes, was recently reported as being transmitted, albeit more rarely, via sexual contact, saliva, breast milk, blood transfusions, and from mother to child [12, 44] .",

For instance, the prevention of arthropod-borne infections (e.g., DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV) using vector control methods has only been partially successful [57] . Preventing mosquitos breeding can be mediated by avoiding the accumulation of rain water in endemic regions. Other preventive measures like the use of repellent creams and clothes that cover the body should be employed to avoid mosquito bites. Insectidal sprays should be utilized in endemic regions to control the mosquito population.",

It is now well known that many emerging human viruses can be transmitted via contact with infected animals and the consumption of animal products, including freshwater and seafood products. The new approach to food safety and to protecting humans against foodborne health risks is the most effective measure to control the human illnesses associated with animal diseases. However, the vast majority of human infections are not reported to clinicians, and so such etiological agents remain unidentified and continue to contaminate the population. As discussed, poultry are high-risk birds for emerging novel influenza A strains. Pork is another potential source of chronic HEV. In a public health care initiative, the French Health Authority has recommended to cook pig-liver sausages prior to consumption [58] . Precautions and proper care should therefore be taken when selecting, purchasing, and hunting high-risk animals and when cooking meat. The current biosecurity measures appear to have been generally more successful for constraining bacterial diseases, but less effective for viral diseases. Surveillance of the emerging human viruses must include livestock, wild animal, and potential arthropod vectors as well as their environments at an international level of coordination. Furthermore, individuals like livestock herders, zookeepers, hunters, rangers, and veterinarians working with reservoir or high-risk animals must take hygienic measures.",

            "text": "The overall balance between exposure and evolution as driving forces of human virus diversity is difficult to assess accurately, particularly for viruses that are not known to have adapted to humans and that exist primarily in animal reservoirs. Despite landmark advances in understanding the nature and biology of many pathogenic viruses, there is limited knowledge on emerging novel viruses, their potential reservoirs, and their modes of transmission. For example, although the person-to-person transmission of BKV is known, no zoonotic or other origin has yet been established. Likewise, though MCV is found in respiratory secretions, healthy skin sheddings and gastrointestinal tissues, its precise mode of transmission still remains undetermined. The perpetual nature of the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases therefore poses an ongoing challenge which is volatile and ever-changing. However, despite incidences of infection and pathogenicity, for many viruses like CCHFV and ZIKV, there is no vaccine prophylaxis or therapeutic intervention available at present. The recurring post-monsoon outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya fever and their control in the Indian subcontinent remain challenging. The complexity of the co-circulation of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in many regions makes differential diagnosis difficult due to overlapping clinical manifestations and the partial cross-reactivity of antibodies [60] [61] [62] [63] . These challenges include a requirement for constant surveillance, prompt and efficient diagnosis, and development of new therapies. There is a further need for devoted research, not only to develop counter-measures but also to understand the basic biology of new viral pathogens and human susceptibilities. While advances in biomedical technologies have enabled us to prospectively identify pathogenic inter-species viruses and assess their transmissibility, the environmental release of several potential \"laboratory-adapted\" viruses is considered to be a big threat.

High population density, rampant constructions, poor sanitation, changing climate, and the introduction of anthropophilic vectors create selective pressure on hosts and pathogen reservoirs. Although we know that a substantial fraction of well-identified mammalian viruses is responsible for human etiology, there are large numbers of evolving viruses waiting to infect and adapt. The unpredictable nature of novel infections, the rare occasions of outbreaks, the small numbers of confirmed cases, the asymptomatic occurrence, and occurrence in remote areas severely hamper the assessment of control and preventive modalities. Efficient vaccines are already available against important human viruses, like HBV and human papillomavirus. Even though drug resistance in HBV and HIV has accelerated alarmingly, new generations of broad-spectrum anti-viral agents as combination regimens hold promise. Moreover, specific geographical regions or interfaces between humans, livestock, wildlife, and the environment should be targets for intense surveillance. In this way, further extensive research will surely enhance our understanding and capacity for predicting new pandemics and preparing control measures in advance.",
