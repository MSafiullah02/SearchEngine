            "text": "First, however, the question is considered as to whether our bodies carry \u201cnormal viral flora,\u201d analogous to the bacterial microbiome. Particularly since the advent of molecular diagnostic and investigative techniques, and the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), it has become more apparent that there are a number of different viruses, belonging to many different families, that can be regularly isolated from healthy individuals and that either are not known to cause disease or do so only under particular circumstances. These may represent lifelong persistent infections, or their presence may be due to an ultimately self-limiting, asymptomatic acute infection with prolonged excretion. Some are bacteriophages associated with gut bacteria. Some may even be animal viruses whose presence is due to the consumption of contaminated food. The composition of this virome is likely to vary between individuals, and over time in the same individual, and will be affected by the environmental exposure to exogenous viruses, and the age and immunocompetence of the host. As with the bacterial microbiome, some of these normally harmless commensal agents may be pathogenic under particular circumstances, for example, immunosuppression. Also similarly to the bacterial microbiome, discovery of one of these agents during disease or in a normally sterile site raises the question about its potential to occasionally cause disease. For example, a new cyclovirus has recently been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with acute CNS infection, and further work is needed to define its pathogenic role.",

More extensive testing of children with respiratory illnesses, particularly using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has revealed a significant percentage infected with two or more different viruses concurrently, and the roles of co-infection and interaction between multiple viruses are difficult to clarify. This subject becomes more complex again in immunosuppressed patients. On the other hand, co-infections involving HIV, HCV, and HBV are not unusual, and the implications for disease progression and antiviral treatment have been well studied.",

Influenza, parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses are common causes throughout life, but other viruses are prominent in particular age groups: RSV, human metapneumovirus and adenoviruses in young children, herpesviruses in adolescents and young adults. Adenoviruses, though not major pathogens overall, are estimated to be responsible for about 5% of all respiratory illnesses in young children. Pharyngoconjunctival fever is just one particular presentation, as described in Chapter 18: Adenoviruses\u2014others include \u201cacute respiratory disease\u201d (ARD) as seen in US military camps. In patients without accompanying nasal symptoms, additional causes should be considered including group A and non-group A streptococci, mycoplasmas, and chlamydias. Primary infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), if delayed until adolescence, presents as a pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis rather than as the gingivostomatitis seen principally in younger children; the characteristic vesicles, rupturing to form ulcers, can be confused only with herpangina, a common type of vesicular pharyngitis caused by coxsackie A viruses (see Chapter 17: Herpesviruses and Chapter 32: Picornaviruses). Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) is usually seen in adolescents and young adults, and is marked by a very severe pharyngitis, often with a diphtheria-like membranous exudate, together with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever (Chapter 17: Herpesviruses).

The disease is often preceded by symptoms of rhinitis but can then develop with remarkable speed. Breathing becomes rapid and labored with marked expiratory wheezing, accompanied by a persistent cough, cyanosis, a variable amount of atelectasis, and hyperinflated lung fields visible by X-ray (fig. 26.4). The infant may die peracutely, and hence RSV is one of the causes of unexplained \u201ccot deaths,\u201d otherwise known as the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Whereas viruses are relatively uncommon causes of pneumonia in immunocompetent adults, accounting for approximately 8% of cases, they are very important in young children. RSV, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus (mainly type 3) are between them responsible for 25% of all pneumonitis in infants in the first year of life. Influenza also causes a considerable number of deaths during epidemic years. Infections with adenoviruses 3 and 7 are less common but can be severe, and long-term sequelae such as obliterative bronchiolitis or bronchiectasis may permanently impair lung function. Up to 20% of pneumonitis in infants has been ascribed to perinatal infection with cytomegalovirus (see Chapter 17: Herpesviruses). CMV may also cause potentially lethal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, as may measles, varicella, and adenoviruses. Moreover, viral pneumonia occasionally develops in adults with varicella and in military recruits during outbreaks of adenovirus 4 or 7 disease. In contrast measles has been often complicated by bacterial pneumonia, especially in malnourished children in Africa and South America. In the elderly, particularly in those with underlying pulmonary or cardiac conditions, influenza is a major cause of death, either via influenza pneumonitis or, more commonly, via secondary bacterial pneumonia attributable to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae.\n",

Enteroviruses are the usual causal agent (see Chapter 32: Picornaviruses). The majority of these children also have a condition known as juvenile dermatomyositis.",

Mumps, for example, can be complicated by severe pancreatitis, and Coxsackie B viruses or various other enteroviruses have been incriminated also. Of greater clinical interest is the question of whether viruses may trigger type 1 (juvenile) diabetes mellitus of the insulin-dependent type (IDDM). Type 1 diabetes is a genetic autoimmune disorder caused by autoreactive CD4+and CD8+T cells destroying insulin-producing \u03b2 cells of the pancreas. Mumps virus infections often affect the \u03b2 cells of the pancreas, and mumps virus, reovirus, and Coxsackie B viruses have all been demonstrated to induce diabetes in mice. Some epidemiological associations between Coxsackie B virus infection and type 1 diabetes have been described. However there is still no proof that these viruses directly induce, or trigger, type 1 diabetes in humans, and indeed some viral infections actually protect against the onset of diabetes in particular animal models. The dramatic decline in mumps virus infection following widespread vaccination has not been mirrored by a decline in the onset of type 1 diabetes. Approximately 20% of children born with the congenital rubella syndrome develop type 1 diabetes by the age of 20. A relationship between rotavirus infection and development of diabetes has also been proposed but not confirmed to date. The association of type 1 diabetes with particular human HLA genotypes, coupled with the other lines of evidence above, have encouraged a hypothesis that pancreatic infection in a genetically susceptible host, with any of perhaps several viruses, may trigger an exaggerated autoimmune response with destruction of \u03b2 cells. Type 2 diabetes is seen more frequently in chronic hepatitis C patients than in controls, which may be related to impaired glucose tolerance following cirrhosis in addition to possible immunological mechanisms.",

            "text": "Viruses are frequently suspected, and sometimes blamed, for causing a range of diseases whose causation is uncertain. Many examples could be highlighted, and some of the more prominent ones are discussed in the relevant sections of this chapter. Other conditions not already mentioned include Kawasaki disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, pityriasis rosea, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, brain tumors, and Bell\u2019s palsy; in these examples a number of different viruses have been investigated to varying degrees for a possible causative role, without conclusive proof emerging. The careful reader should by now appreciate the rigorous evidence-based approach needed to confirm a true causative role for a particular virus, and the wealth of sophisticated molecular, epidemiological, and clinical tools available for such work. Herein lies one of the many ongoing challenges for virologists of the future.",
