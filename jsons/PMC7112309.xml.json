The sophistication of the strategies elaborated by viruses is unsurpassed, and many of these strategies are common among viruses, but are rare or even nonexistent in uninfected cells. Many were first demonstrated in viral systems before being described in cell systems (reviewed in Bernardi and Haenni, 1998). The genome of viruses is compact and used to its limits: overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) are frequent, intergenic regions (IGRs) are usually short, and noncoding as well as coding regions are often involved in regulation of replication, transcription, and/or translation.",

The genome of HDV is a (\u2212) sense, closed circular, and highly structured single-stranded RNA (of \u223c 1680 nts in HDV genotype III) referred to as the genomic RNA (Fig. 1\n); it is devoid of coding capacity (i.e., devoid of ORF). However, the complementary antigenomic RNA contains a unique ORF for the short surface antigen HDAg-S of 195 amino acids (aa); HDAg-S is produced from an 800\u2010nt long linear sg mRNA that is both capped and polyadenylated (Gudima et al., 2000). The protein is produced throughout infection and is required for HDV replication. At late times in infection, editing of the antigenomic RNA occurs by deamination of the A residue (position 1012) of the UAG codon that ends the HDAg-S ORF; editing does not occur on the HDAg-S mRNA. Hence the antigenome, which is the template for editing, must be replicated to yield the edited genomic RNA prior to being transcribed to produce the edited sg mRNA that is also capped and polyadenylated. Editing also requires previous refolding of the antigenome, from a rod-like to a branched double-hairpin structure in HDV genotype III, or to a highly conserved base-paired structure in HDV genotype I (Casey, 2002, Cheng et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Deamination of the A residue in UAG leading to an I (inosine) residue and producing the triplet UIG (Fig. 1) is triggered by a host adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA substrates. Upon replication of the edited antigenome, the I residue recognized as G leads to ACC in the edited genomic RNA that is then transcribed as UGG coding for tryptophane in the edited mRNA. As a consequence, the edited sg mRNA presents an extended ORF and produces HDAg-L of 210 aa. The two viral proteins share the same N-terminal region, the longer protein bearing an extended C-terminal region; they are responsible for two distinct functions in the HDV-infected cell. The longer protein inhibits replication and editing and is necessary for virus assembly, whereas the shorter protein is required for replication (Cheng et al., 2003). Editing is, therefore, a vital process for HDV propagation, and an exquisite balance between the nonedited and edited mRNAs, and between replication and virus production is a major factor in maintaining optimum virus production. How this equilibrium is reached remains largely speculative, although editing is known to involve specific structural elements that depend on the HDV genotype considered (Casey, 2002, Cheng et al., 2003).",

They possess a nonsegmented (also known as monopartite) (\u2212) strand RNA genome of 15\u201316 kb (reviewed in Nagai, 1999). Their genome encodes a minimum of six structural proteins that are produced from six capped and polyadenylated mRNAs. In the complementary antigenomic RNA, the ORFs are separated by conserved sequences that dictate initiation and termination of the six transcripts. Except for the phosphoprotein (P) mRNA, each mRNA expresses a single protein from a single ORF. The P gene is more complex. In most members of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae (family Paramyxoviridae), editing of the P mRNA results in the insertion of 1\u20135 nontemplated G residues within a run of Gs at the level of a conserved AnGn editing sequence (Cattaneo et al., 1989, Mahapatra et al., 2003, Steward et al., 1993; reviewed in Strauss and Strauss, 1991), presumably as a result of a stuttering process (Vidal et al., 1990). This causes a shift within the P ORF and may lead to the synthesis of up to six nonstructural proteins from edited and nonedited mRNAs depending on the virus. In Sendai virus, two mRNAs can be produced by editing of the P/C (also known as P) mRNA, the V mRNA (insertion of 1 G), and the W mRNA (insertion of 2 or 5 Gs) (Fig. 2A\n) (Curran et al., 1991). The V protein, a cysteine-rich protein, binds Zn+ 2, a characteristic related to virus pathogenicity in mice. Indeed, mutation of the cysteine residues in the corresponding V protein in the Sendai virus genome reduces Zn+ 2 binding and pathogenicity (Fukuhara et al., 2002).",

It is less frequently encountered among RNA viruses, although it is observed in certain RNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus. This is the case of retroviruses whose mRNAs undergo a complicated cascade of splicing and alternative splicing events. The splicing mechanisms used by these viruses will not be developed here, having received considerable attention in several review articles (Cullen, 1998, Stoltzfus and Madsen, 2006). Examples of nonretroviruses whose RNA genomes multiply in the nucleus and employ splicing are briefly presented here; they are Borna disease virus (BDV) and Influenza virus.",

            "text": "BDV (family Bornaviridae) belongs to the order Mononegavirales. However, it differs from the other members of this order by several unique features (reviewed in de la Torre, 2002, Tomonaga et al., 2002). As opposed to the other members of this order whose life cycle occurs entirely in the cytoplasm, BDV is replicated and transcribed in the nucleus of the infected cell and employs the cellular RNA splicing machinery. The two splice donor and three splice acceptor sites follow the general mammalian splice site consensus (Fig. 3\n). The six ORFs contained in the antigenome are not separated by conserved IGRs as in other mononegavirales. Rather, the six proteins of BDV are translated from capped and polyadenylated transcripts that are initiated at only three sites (S1\u2013S3) and terminate at five possible sites (T1\u2013T4, t6). The nucleoprotein (known as N) is produced from a transcript initiated at S1, and the X protein and P from a transcript initiated at S2. The matrix (M), glycoprotein (G), and polymerase (L) are all produced from transcripts initiated at S3, and resort to alternative splicing for the production of the transcripts required. Splicing of intron I that overlaps the M ORF abolishes synthesis of the corresponding protein and produces protein G, while splicing of introns I and II (the latter corresponds to most of the G ORF) leads to the synthesis of the L protein. Additionally, splicing of intron III that uses the same 5\u2032 splice donor site as intron II but another 3\u2032 splice acceptor site also eliminates most of the G ORF as well as the 5\u2032 region of the L ORF. This could lead to the production of yet another BDV protein; this putative protein has so far not been identified (reviewed in Jordan and Lipkin, 2001). Although translation of M is prevented by splicing of intron I, this leaves a minicistron corresponding to the N-terminal region of M which enhances translation of G, presumably by promoting ribosomal reinitiation. However, mutation experiments using the unspliced transcript, suggest that leaky scanning is also a mechanism that could lead to the synthesis of G from the unspliced transcript (Schneider et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Influenza viruses (family Orthomyxoviridae) are enveloped viruses with a segmented (\u2212) strand RNA genome; they are replicated and transcribed in the nucleus by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex composed of PB1, PB2, and PA. In the nucleus of infected cells, transcription of the viral RNAs into mRNAs by the RdRp requires cooperation with ongoing transcription by the cellular RNA polymerase II, since the RdRp initiates synthesis of viral mRNAs via cap-snatching using capped cellular mRNAs (see below; reviewed in Lamb and Krug, 2001, Rao et al., 2003). Influenza A virus and Influenza B virus are composed of eight RNA segments. Alternative splicing leads to the synthesis of two proteins from segments seven and eight of Influenza A virus. Regulation of the choice of the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice sites is finely controlled. Although alternative splicing occurs in many viruses, only in a few cases have viral proteins been shown to be involved in this mechanism. In segment seven of Influenza A virus, two alternative 5\u2032 splice sites control the production of the shorter (mRNA3: 111 nts) and the longer (M2 mRNA: 151 nts) spliced mRNAs from the pre-mRNA known as M1 mRNA. Both spliced RNAs use the same 3\u2032 splice site. At early times after infection, the more favorable upstream 5\u2032 splice site is used, leading to the synthesis of mRNA3 that potentially codes for a 9-aa peptide (as yet undetected). At later times after infection, the RdRp complex now produced in sufficient amounts binds to and blocks the upstream 5\u2032 splice site, forcing the cell splicing machinery to switch to the less favorable downstream 5\u2032 splice site. As a consequence, M2 mRNA is synthesized as is also its encoded M2 ion channel protein of 97 aa (Shih et al., 1995).",

Thus, viruses have evolved several strategies to synthesize the proteins corresponding to 5\u2032-distal ORFs (reviewed in Miller and Koev, 2000, White, 2002). One of the most common mechanisms is the production of 3\u2032-coterminal sgRNAs. In such templates, the internally positioned and the 3\u2032-proximal ORFs in the genome of (+) strand RNA viruses are accessed by sgRNAs in which these ORFs become 5\u2032-proximal and serve as mRNAs. sgRNAs are generally synthesized by internal initiation of RNA synthesis on the complementary (\u2212) RNA strand. They are 5\u2032-truncated versions of the genomic RNA and therefore perfect copies of the region of the genome from which they derive.",

This mechanism was first described for the synthesis of the mRNAs of Influenza virus (Bouloy et al., 1978, Krug et al., 1979). The endonuclease activity of the viral RdRp cleaves nuclear cellular capped RNAs to generate capped primers of up to about 20 nts in length for viral mRNA synthesis. As a result, the viral mRNAs contain capped nonviral oligonucleotides at their 5\u2032 end. Several plant (members of the family Bunyaviridae and of the genus Tenuivirus) and animal (members of the family Bunyaviridae) viruses with (\u2212) strand or ambisense RNA genomes also use this transcription initiation mechanism. Since these viruses multiply in the cytoplasm, they use cytoplasmic rather than nuclear cellular capped RNAs as primers (Garcin and Kolakofsky, 1990, Garcin et al., 1995, Huiet et al., 1993, Raju et al., 1990, Ram\u00edrez et al., 1995, Vialat and Bouloy, 1992).",

            "text": "The most common strategy of translation initiation encountered among eukaryotes is cap-dependent translation (reviewed in Jackson and Kaminski, 1995, Pestova et al., 2007). This occurs in capped, generally monocistronic mRNAs, whose initiation codon lies close to the 5\u2032 cap structure, and whose leader sequence also called 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) possesses varying degrees of secondary structure. A number of complex steps lead to binding of the small 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. The assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2, GTP, and Met-tRNAiMet forms the ternary complex (TC). Interaction of the TC with the 40S ribosomal subunit, facilitated by eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3, leads to the formation of the 43S preinitiation complex. eIF3 is composed of 13 subunits (eIF3a\u2013eIF3m) (Hinnebusch, 2006). The cap structure is recognized by the heterotrimer eIF4F composed of eIF4G (multivalent scaffolding protein), eIF4E (cap-binding protein), and eIF4A (ATP-dependent helicase). The 43S preinitiation complex binds to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA with the help of eIF4F in the presence of eIF4B, and the complex scans the mRNA leader sequence until it reaches the initiation codon to form the 48S initiation complex (Kozak and Shatkin, 1978). The initiation codon is usually the first AUG codon encountered; it is recognized by base-pairing with the anticodon of Met-tRNAiMet and the efficiency of recognition depends on the sequence context surrounding the initiation codon. The most favorable context in mammals is RCCAUGG with purine (R) at position \u2212 3 (Kozak, 1986, Kozak, 1991), and in plants it is ACAAUGG (F\u00fctterer and Hohn, 1996). At this step the 48S initiation complex is joined by the large 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S ribosome. Joining requires two additional factors: eIF5 and eIF5B. Hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP induced by eIF5 leads to reduction in the affinity of eIF2 for Met-tRNAiMet. In turn, the essential ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of eIF5B leads to displacement of the eIF2-bound GDP and other initiation factors from the 40S subunit (reviewed in Pestova et al., 2007). The assembled 80S ribosome contains the initiator Met-tRNAiMet in the ribosomal P (peptidyl) site and another aa-tRNA in the ribosomal A (aminoacyl) site. The delivery of the aa-tRNA is mediated by the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 1A\u2013GTP complex. After peptide bond formation (triggered by the peptidyl transferase in the ribosome) eEF2 binding and subsequent GTP hydrolysis catalyze ribosomal translocation, and the elongation cycle begins (Frank et al., 2007). This general strategy is also adopted by a large number of eukaryotic viruses. Yet the RNA genome of certain viruses lacks a cap structure; the 5\u2032 end of such RNA genomes can carry a covalently bound viral protein designated viral protein genome-linked (VPg), or begin with a di- (or a mono-) phosphate. In other cases, the 5\u2032 UTR of the viral RNA contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) responsible for initiation of translation.",

            "text": "In most eukaryotic mRNAs, the 5\u2032 cap structure and the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail appear to work together leading to efficient translation initiation. This is believed to occur when the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends are brought in close proximity, referred to as the mRNA circularization or closed-loop model. The existence of cellular polyribosomes arranged in a circle was visualized using electron microscopy (Christensen et al., 1987). Circularization is brought about by binding of the initiation factor eIF4E to the 5\u2032 cap and to eIF4G. In turn, eIF4G binds to the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound to the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail (Fig. 4A\n). PABP contains four conserved RNA recognition motifs in its N-terminal domain that are involved in RNA and eIF4G interactions, and a C-terminal domain that binds to several proteins, including eIF4B, the eukaryotic release factor (eRF) 3 and the PABP-interacting protein 1 (Paip1). Therefore, PABP promotes the formation of the closed-loop complex by binding directly to eIF4G (Gallie, 1998, Imataka et al., 1998, Gale et al., 2000; reviewed in Dreher and Miller, 2006) or through Paip1 binding to eIF4A (Craig et al., 1998) or by PABP interaction with eIF4B (Bushell et al., 2001, Le et al., 1997) (Fig. 4A). Circularization thus appears to be mediated by RNA\u2013protein and protein\u2013protein interactions. Increasing evidence has been provided for the involvement of both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of eukaryotic mRNAs and viral mRNAs in initiation of translation (reviewed in Edgil and Harris, 2006, Hentze et al., 2007, Komarova et al., 2006, Mazumder et al., 2003, Wilkie et al., 2003). In addition to contributing to mRNA stabilization, circularization probably facilitates ribosome recruiting from the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA after a terminated round of translation, to the 5\u2032 region for initiation of a second round. This could be achieved via interaction of PABP with eRF3 that by interacting with eRF1, would result in the formation of a closed loop by way of the 5\u2032 cap\u2014eIF4E\u2013eIF4G\u2013PABP\u2013eRF3\u2013eRF1\u2014termination codon (Fig. 4A) (Uchida et al., 2002).",

Nevertheless, such mRNAs are highly efficient, and circularization presumably required for efficient translation is achieved via various mechanisms. In the case of viral RNAs with a poly(A) tail, circularization has been investigated by looking for viral and/or host proteins that participate in circularization. For instance, in Poliovirus (family Picornaviridae) RNA whose VPg is removed soon after entry of the virus into the cell, the long 5\u2032 UTR of its genomic RNA contains an IRES preceded by a cloverleaf structure (Fig. 4B). PABP interacts with the poly(A) tail of the viral RNA. It also binds to the poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) that binds to the IRES structure to circularize the viral mRNA for translation (Blyn et al., 1997, Silvera et al., 1999, Walter et al., 2002). Binding of PCBP2 to PABP leads to circularization of the viral RNA with the formation of an RNA\u2013protein\u2013protein\u2013RNA bridge. In addition, the cellular protein SRp20 that is involved in cellular mRNA splicing and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and also cofractionates with ribosomal subunits, interacts with PCBP2, and promotes Poliovirus IRES-driven translation (Bedard et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Circularization can also be achieved by direct base pairing between a region in the 5\u2032 UTR and a region in the 3\u2032 UTR of an mRNA; it is used in particular by viral mRNAs that possess neither cap (or VPg) nor poly(A) tail. In several instances, specific interactions have been detected and their functional significance investigated by phylogenetic studies of conserved regions within the ends of viral RNAs, and by mutation analyses of the base-paired regions presumably involved (reviewed in Miller and White, 2006). Among plant RNA viruses, the region of the 3\u2032 UTR required for translation is frequently referred to as 3\u2032-cap-independent translation element (3\u2032-CITE). Several classes of 3\u2032-CITEs have been described (reviewed in Miller et al., 2007). They presumably operate by long-distance base pairing between the 3\u2032 UTR and a complementary region in the 5\u2032 UTR, leading to interactions known as kissing stem\u2013loop interactions. Some of the well-studied cases are those of Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV; family Tombusviridae; Meulewaeter et al., 2004, Shen and Miller, 2004), Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV; Guo et al., 2001, Meulewaeter et al., 1998) Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV; family Tombusviridae; Fabian and White, 2004, Fabian and White, 2006), Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV; family Luteoviridae; Guo et al., 2000, Guo et al., 2001), and Maize necrotic streak virus (family Tombusviridae; Scheets and Redinbaugh, 2006). An interesting outcome of these studies has been the observation that in certain cases, part of the 3\u2032 UTR can function by recruiting initiation factors required for initiation of translation. This seems to be the case of STNV in which a 3\u2032 translation enhancer (TE) mimics a 5\u2032 cap structure (Gazo et al., 2004) by binding to eIF4E and this binding is enhanced by eIF4G (or eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G of eIFiso4F, isoforms only found in plants). Moreover, the 3\u2032 UTR of STNV RNA contains a region that has been reported to be complementary of the 3\u2032 end of the ribosomal 18S RNA (Danthinne et al., 1993). Thus, long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs might bring eIF4F and the 40S subunit positioned on 3\u2032 UTR close to the initiation codon, favoring initiation of translation. Phylogenetic studies suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in stimulating translation of other viral mRNAs devoid of cap and poly(A) tail (Gazo et al., 2004, Miller et al., 2007, Shen and Miller, 2004, Treder et al., 2008).",

These are mRNA-binding proteins such as the pyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), ITAF45, PCBP2, the cellular cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein designated upstream of N-ras (unr), and the La autoantigen.

The same applies to the FMDV IRES-mediated translation from the first initiator AUG (reviewed in Pestova et al., 2001). PTB, an auxiliary cellular 57\u2010kDa protein with four RNA recognition motifs, strongly stimulates initiation of translation of all group 1 and 2 IRESs (Andreev et al., 2007, Borovjagin et al., 1994, Gosert et al., 2000, Hunt and Jackson, 1999, Pilipenko et al., 2000). ITAF45 is additionally required for FMDV IRES-mediated translation, and PCBP2 as well as unr for Poliovirus and Rhinovirus IRESs (Andreev et al., 2007, Blyn et al., 1997, Boussadia et al., 2003, Pilipenko et al., 2000).

Thus, the IRES functionally replaces eIF4F on the 40S ribosomal subunit (Siridechadilok et al., 2005). Lack of eIF4F is compensated by conformational modifications in the 40S ribosomal subunit (Spahn et al., 2001). Moreover, the activity of HCV-like IRESs is also affected by the coding sequence immediately downstream of the initiation codon. Not only flaviviruses but also RNA genomes of some picornaviruses such as Porcine Teschovirus carry HCV-like IRES elements within their 5\u2032 UTR (Pisarev et al., 2004).",

The monopartite RNA genome of CrPV harbors a 5\u2032 VPg and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. It contains two nonoverlapping ORFs separated by an IGR (as opposed to picornaviruses that have only one ORF); the expression of the two ORFs is triggered by two distinct IRESs, one in the 5\u2032 UTR and the other in the IGR (Jan et al., 2003, Sasaki and Nakashima, 1999, Sasaki and Nakashima, 2000, Wilson et al., 2000b). As shown using the long (580 nts) 5\u2032 IRES contained in the Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV) RNA, the 5\u2032 UTR initiates translation of a nonstuctural polyprotein at the expected AUG codon. No specific boundaries of this IRES can be defined, suggesting that the IRES contains multiple domains capable of recruiting ribosomes for translation (Terenin et al., 2005). The IGR of 175\u2013533 nts separating the two ORFs contains the second IRES (\u223c 180 nts) that initiates synthesis of a structural polyprotein on a non-AUG codon and requires neither initiation factors nor Met-tRNAiMet but a small domain (domain 3) downstream of the IGR IRES that docks into the 40S ribosomal P site mimicking the tRNA anticodon-loop structure during translation initiation (Costantino et al., 2008, Jan and Sarnow, 2002, Wilson et al., 2000a). In most cases, initiation from the second IRES begins at a GCU, GCA, or GCC triplet coding for alanine or at a CAA triplet coding for glutamine (reviewed in Pisarev et al., 2005). In the model proposed for the initiation of the second IRES, domain 3 within the IGR occupies the ribosomal P site, the ribosomal A site remaining accessible for the Ala-tRNA or the Gln-tRNA, and translocation occurs on the ribosome without peptide bond formation (designated as the elongation-competent assembly of ribosome). As in the case of the HCV IRES, binding of the CrPV IGR to the 40S ribosomal subunit induces conformational changes on the ribosome (Costantino et al., 2008, Pfingsten et al., 2006, Spahn et al., 2004).",

Following a long 5\u2032 leader sequence harboring several sORFs that are bypassed by ribosome shunting, synthesis is initiated on an AUU codon at ORF I (F\u00fctterer and Hohn, 1996). Only 10% of the ribosomes initiate at ORF I; the remaining 90% reach ORFs II and III and initiate on an AUG codon (reviewed in Ryabova et al., 2006). A similar situation occurs in other pararetroviruses. RNA 2 of the bipartite (+) sense single-stranded RNA genome of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV, genus Furovirus) codes for two proteins; the shorter (19K) CP is produced via conventional AUG initiation, whereas the N-terminally extended 28K protein is initiated at a CUG codon upstream of the CP ORF (Shirako, 1998).

About one-third of the ribosomes fail to initiate translation of the CP and scan the template initiating translation of the second ORF, more than 100 residues downstream of the first ORF (Herzog et al., 1995). RTBV contains a closed-circular double-stranded DNA genome that is transcribed yielding two mRNAs. The longer polycistronic mRNA (known as pregenomic RNA) encodes three ORFs (I, II, and III) that are linked by AUGA, the termination codon of the upstream ORF overlapping the initiation codon of the downstream ORF (F\u00fctterer et al., 1997). ORF I is initiated at an AUU codon, preceded by a long 5\u2032 UTR with several sORFs that are bypassed by ribosome shunting. On the other hand, ORFs II and III initiate at a conventional AUG codon. However, the AUG initiating ORF II is in a poor context, and the majority of the ribosomes bypass this AUG to reach the downstream more favorable AUG of ORF III. Leaky scanning therefore accounts for initiation of translation of ORFs II and III.",

            "text": "Among eukaryotic viruses, polycistronic mRNAs have been the most thoroughly examined in viruses of the family Caulimoviridae, in particular in the double-strand DNA virus Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV). The large 35S mRNA of CaMV and related viruses contains up to seven ORFs (Fig. 5\n), and for some of them recurrent translation depends on reinitiation activated by the transactivator (TAV). The TAV protein is encoded by ORF VI contained in the pregenomic (or polycistronic) 35S mRNA; it is expressed by the 19S sgRNA in which it is the only ORF (Pooggin et al., 2001). In dicistronic constructs harboring the CaMV ORF VII followed by ORF I (or by ORFs II, III, IV, V, or an artificial ORF) fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, very low levels of CAT activity were obtained in plant protoplasts; however, when the product of ORF VI was included, considerably higher levels of CAT activity were observed (Bonneville et al., 1989, F\u00fctterer and Hohn, 1991). The second ORF of the dicistronic construct is synthesized by reinitiation and not by an IRES, since a stem structure positioned at various sites upstream of this ORF hinders its translation (F\u00fctterer and Hohn, 1991). TAV-stimulated initiation of the second ORF does not depend on the distance separating the two ORFs, since the distance can be abolished as in a quadruplet AUGA, or the ORFs can be separated by as many as 700 nts, and even limited overlap between the ORFs is possible. TAV directly binds to the eIF3g subunit of eIF3 and associates with the L18 and L24 proteins of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Leh et al., 2000, Park et al., 2001). These interactions result in TAV\u2013eIF3 complex association with the translocating ribosome during translation, favoring reinitiation of downstream ORFs. On the other hand, eIF4B can compete with TAV for binding to eIF3g, since the binding sites of these two proteins on eIF3g overlap. Overexpression of eIF4B inhibits TAV-mediated reinitiation of a second ORF, probably by inhibiting TAV\u2013eIF3g-40S complex formation (Park et al., 2004).",

The sgRNAs of these viruses that also contain a VPg represent widely studied examples of reinitiation by mammalian ribosomes after translation of a long ORF. The Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus genomic RNA codes for a large polyprotein ORF1 that is subsequently processed producing the viral nonstructural proteins and the 3\u2032 terminally located major CP VP60, as well as a small 3\u2032 terminally located ORF2 in another reading frame. The 3\u2032-terminal part of ORF1 overlaps the 5\u2032 region of ORF2. Expression of ORF2 yields the minor CP VP10 and is produced from a sgRNA that also contains the region of ORF1 expressing VP60. Thus, the sgRNA codes for the major VP60 encoded by the 3\u2032-terminal part of ORF1, and for the minor VP10 produced by ORF2. The two ORFs overlap by AUGUCUGA such that the termination codon (UGA) of ORF1 lies downstream of the initiation codon (AUG) of ORF2. Synthesis of VP10 occurs from the genomic as well as from the sgRNA and involves an unusual translation termination/reinitiation process. Indeed, synthesis of VP10 depends strictly on the presence of the termination codon ending ORF1 preceded by a sequence element of about 80 nts (Meyers, 2003). The sequence element contains two motifs that are essential for expression of ORF2, one of which is conserved among caliciviruses and is complementary to a sequence in the 18S ribosomal RNA. In FCV, sgORF1 and sgORF2 overlap by 4 nts (AUGA) and translation in a reticulocyte lysate of the FCV sgRNAs showed that ORF1/ORF2 termination/reinitiation does not require the eIF4F complex and that the 3\u2032-terminal RNA sequence of ORF1 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and to IF3 (Luttermann and Meyers, 2007, Meyers, 2007, P\u00f6yry et al., 2007). Thus, the termination/reinitiation process requires sequence elements that could prevent dissociation of postterminating ribosomes via RNA\u2013RNA, RNA\u2013protein, and/or protein\u2013protein interactions.",

            "text": "A ribosome shunting mechanism has been proposed to explain how initiation of translation occurs in viral polycistronic mRNAs that have a long leader sequence with generally several sORFs, a long low-energy hairpin structure and a probable packaging signal within the 5\u2032 UTR (reviewed in Ryabova et al., 2006). This is the case of CaMV (Fig. 5). The ribosomes having entered at the level of the cap structure on the 35S mRNA would scan a few nts, then skip from a \u201ctake-off site\u201d over part of the leader sequence containing a structural element and sORFs, to reach a \u201clanding site,\u201d and finally scan to the downstream ORF. It has been suggested that formation of a leader hairpin between the two sites would bring these sites in close proximity, favoring shunting. It is generally assumed that shunting is more easily achieved if the upstream ORF is short, such that the initiation factors that allowed initiation of translation of the sORF may have at least partly remained on the ribosome during translation (reviewed in Jackson, 2005). In addition to the size of the sORF, the time required for scanning seems also to be important (P\u00f6yry et al., 2004), the eIF4F initiation complex remaining on the ribosome for a few seconds without interruption of sORF translation. The leader sequence of the CaMV 35S mRNA is replete with sORFs. Of these, the 5\u2032-proximal sORF, sORF A, is indispensable for ribosome shunting and infectivity; its aa sequence is generally not important but it must be translated and should be between 2 and 10 codons long for efficient shunting. Another important cis-acting element for shunting includes the distance between the termination codon of sORF A and the base of the leader hairpin (reviewed in Ryabova et al., 2006). Finally, it has been reported that TAV promotes expression of ORF VII (Pooggin et al., 2001).",

Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 inhibits the exchange of GDP for GTP catalyzed by the exchange factor eIF2B, and leads to the sequestration of eIF2B in a complex with eIF2 resulting in general inhibition of protein synthesis (Sudhakar et al., 2000; reviewed in Hinnebusch, 2005). The amount of eIF2B in cells is limiting as compared to eIF2. Thus, even small changes in the phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 have a drastic effect on translation due to eIF2B sequestration (Balachandran and Barber, 2004, Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001, Sudhakar et al., 2000, Yang and Hinnebusch, 1996). For several mRNAs the eIF2 complex is replaced by a single polypeptide designated eIF2A that directs codon-dependent and GTP-independent Met-tRNAiMet binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit and may act by favoring expression of specific proteins (Adams et al., 1975, Merrick and Anderson, 1975, Zoll et al., 2002).",

However, there are several examples in which viruses use eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to switch off cell translation and direct the cell machinery to synthesize their own proteins (Fig. 6). A classical illustration of how eIF2 modification fosters translation of viral mRNAs is initiation of translation on the CrPV IRES. The IRES contained in the IGR promotes initiation of protein synthesis without the assistance of any initiation factors, including eIF2 (reviewed in Doudna and Sarnow, 2007, Pisarev et al., 2005). Moreover, CrPV stimulates eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation; this inactivates host mRNA translation by decreasing the amount of preinitiation 43S ribosomal complexes formed and facilitates translation initiation on the CrPV IRES. Indeed, lowering the amounts of TC and 43S ribosomal complexes increases the efficiency of initiation on the CrPV IRES (Pestova et al., 2004, Thompson et al., 2001). HCV encodes proteins known to inactivate PKR (or PKR + PERK) function(s) (Garcia et al., 2007). However, HCV IRES-driven translation initiation can also be maintained in the presence of activated PKR and reduced TCs (Robert et al., 2006). A new pathway of eIF2- and eIF5-independent initiation of translation on the HCV IRES has been proposed recently in which assembly of the 80S complex requires only two initiation factors, eIF5B and eIF3 (Terenin et al., 2008).",

It was shown that a hairpin loop structure within the 26S mRNA-coding region, located downstream of the AUG initiation codon, promotes eIF2-independent translation with the help of eIF2A (Ventoso et al., 2006). However, the fact that translation of the 26S mRNA must be coupled to transcription to be efficient in infected cells suggests that additional viral or cellular factors are involved in translation initiation on the 26S mRNA (Sanz et al., 2007).",

It interacts with the C-terminus of eIF4G (Cuesta et al., 2000) and with the tripartite leader sequence of viral late mRNAs (Xi et al., 2004). Binding of the 100K protein to eIF4G evicts Mnk1 from the eIF4F complex, thus impairing eIF4E phosphorylation in the initiation complex and inhibiting translation of host mRNAs (Cuesta et al., 2000). On the other hand, adenoviral late mRNAs are translated efficiently via ribosome shunting (Xi et al., 2004, Xi et al., 2005). VSV infection causes dephosphorylation of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 thus hampering host protein synthesis (Fig. 7). The resulting changes in eIF4F do not inhibit translation of viral mRNAs, although the detailed mechanism of how VSV mRNAs that are capped and possess poly(A) tails overcome the obstacle created has not been elucidated (Connor and Lyles, 2002). Influenza virus infection results in partial (up to 70%) dephosphorylation of eIF4E and concomitant loss of eIF4F activity (Fig. 7). Thus, Influenza virus mRNAs that are capped via cap-snatching and polyadenylated (Herz et al., 1981, Krug et al., 1979, Luo et al., 1991) are translated efficiently under conditions of partial inactivation of eIF4F (Feigenblum and Schneider, 1993) when host protein synthesis is blocked (Katze and Krug, 1990). Several studies have shown that the NS1 viral protein selectively promotes translation of viral mRNAs by increasing their rate of initiation (de la Luna et al., 1995, Enami et al., 1994, Katze et al., 1986, Park and Katze, 1995) and interacts with PABP and eIF4GI (one of the two isoforms of eIF4G in animals) in viral mRNA translation initiation complexes (Arag\u00f3n et al., 2000, Burgui et al., 2003). Moreover, a recent report has provided evidence that the Influenza virus RdRp substitutes for eIF4E in viral mRNA translation and binds to the translation preinitiation complex (Burgui et al., 2007). One can speculate that the combination of dephosphorylation of eIF4E, hyperphosphorylation of eIF4G, and binding of RdRp to the preinitiation complex and of NS1 to eIF4GI creates an eIF4F factor more specific for Influenza virus mRNA translation.",

This is a well-established example of viral switch from cap-dependent to IRES-mediated initiation of translation in picornavirus-infected cells (Gingras et al., 1996, Svitkin et al., 2005). Simian virus 40 (SV40; family Polyomaviridae) is a recent example of a virus that causes significant decrease in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 late in lytic infection. This process is specifically mediated by the SV40 small t antigen. As in the case of Poliovirus and EMCV, dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its subsequent binding to eIF4E displaces eIF4E from the eIF4F complex. This mechanism functions as a switch in translation initiation mechanisms favoring IRES-mediated translation (Yu et al., 2005). Indeed, recent studies have shown that the SV40 late 19S mRNA possesses an IRES (Yu and Alwine, 2006).",

At the same time HSV-1 infection dramatically impairs host protein synthesis (Elgadi et al., 1999, Everly et al., 2002, Sciabica et al., 2003) whereas with HCMV the effect on host protein synthesis is weak (Stinski, 1977). Interestingly, the ratio of eIF4F over 4E-BP1 increases in cells infected with either HSV-1 or HCMV, promoting assembly of eIF4F complexes. For HSV-1 this is achieved exclusively through proteasome-mediated degradation of 4E-BP1 (Walsh and Mohr, 2004), whereas for HCMV, replication induces an increase in the overall abundance of the eIF4F components eIF4E and eIF4G, and also of PABP relative to the translational repressor 4E-BP1 (Walsh et al., 2005). However, liberation of eIF4E from 4E-BP1 in the case of HSV-1 is insufficient to accelerate eIF4E incorporation into the eIF4F complex. A recent study showed that the HSV-1 ICP6 gene product binds to eIF4G promoting association of eIF4E with the N-terminus of eIF4G and facilitating eIF4E phosphorylation. This suggests a chaperone role for ICP6 in eIF4F assembly (Walsh and Mohr, 2006).",

Due to the central role of eIF4G in translation initiation, many viruses belonging to the families Picornaviridae, Retroviridae, and Caliciviridae have evolved mechanisms to modify the function of eIF4G so as to prevent cell protein synthesis. These viruses induce cleavage of eIF4G, separating the N-terminal eIF4E-binding domain from the C-terminal eIF4A- and eIF3-binding domains (Fig. 8\n). As a consequence, the capacity of eIF4G to connect capped mRNAs to the 40S ribosome is abolished by the virus, inducing host translation shutoff.",

The Poliovirus and HRV 2Apro also cleave eIF4GII (at aa 699/670) but more slowly than cleavage of eIF4GI (Gradi et al., 1998, Svitkin et al., 1999). FMDV has evolved an alternate papain-like protease, L-pro in place of 2Apro to cleave both isoforms of eIF4G (Gradi et al., 2004); it cleaves eIF4GI 7 aa upstream of 2Apro (Fig. 8), and eIF4GII 1 aa downstream of the 2Apro cleavage site (reviewed in Lloyd, 2006). Poliovirus infection also activates two cell proteases that cleave eIF4GI close to the 2Apro cleavage site (Zamora et al., 2002). The 3Cpro of FMDV and the 2Apro and 3Cpro of CVB-3 also cleave eIF4GI (Fig. 8) (Chau et al., 2007, Strong and Belsham, 2004). Degradation of eIF4GI has been observed in CD4+ cells infected with Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1; family Retroviridae) (Ventoso et al., 2001). The HIV-1 protease efficiently cleaves eIF4GI at multiple sites, but not eIF4GII (Ohlmann et al., 2002). Proteases of HIV-2 and of members of the family Retroviridae (Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), Simian immunodeficiency virus, and Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)) also cleave eIF4GI (Alvarez et al., 2003; reviewed in Lloyd, 2006). Finally, infection of cells with FCV leads to cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII and host translation shutoff (Willcocks et al., 2004); the identity of the protease responsible for cleavage of eIF4G is unknown, but it could be a cellular protease activated by the infection.",

PABP is proteolytically processed by the calicivirus 3C-like protease (Kuyumcu-Martinez et al., 2004a), and HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases are also able to cleave PABP in the absence of other viral proteins (Alvarez et al., 2006). The contribution of PABP cleavage versus eIF4G cleavage in shutoff of host or viral protein synthesis has not been compared directly. Poliovirus cleavage of PABP appears to be promoted by the interaction of PABP with translation initiation factors, ribosomes or poly(A)-containing RNAs (Kuyumcu-Martinez et al., 2002, Rivera and Lloyd, 2008). Processing of PABP could either occur through one of the components that provides shutoff of host translation or could favor the switch from translation to replication of viral genomes as for example PABP cleavage by 3Cpro in Poliovirus- and HAV-infected cells (Bonderoff et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2007).",

The viral NSP3 protein binds to the conserved motif UGACC located at the 3\u2032 end of the viral mRNA, and circularizes the mRNA via interaction with eIF4G (Fig. 4C). Since NSP3 has a higher affinity for eIF4G than does PABP, it replaces PABP and disrupts host mRNA circularization (Michel et al., 2000, Vende et al., 2000). NSP3\u2013eIF4G interaction results in reduced efficiency of host mRNA translation. NSP3-mediated circularization has been reported to enhance Rotavirus mRNA translation (Vende et al., 2000) and to be dispensable for translation of the viral mRNAs (Montero et al., 2006). X-ray structure and biophysical studies have shown that NSP3 forms an asymmetric homodimer around the conserved motif at the 3\u2032 end of Rotavirus mRNAs (Deo et al., 2002).",

This results in the synthesis of two proteins, the \u201cstopped\u201d and \u201ctransframe\u201d proteins; they are identical from the N-terminus to the frameshift site but differ thereafter, and the stopped protein is always the more abundant of the two proteins (reviewed in Farabaugh, 2000). The occurrence of \u2212 1 frameshift is more frequent and has been more extensively studied than + 1 frameshift. \u2212 1 Frameshift is common among (+) strand RNA viruses; it has been found in most retroviruses, in coronaviruses, L-A viruses of yeast and in several plant viruses belonging to diverse groups (Table III\n). Frameshift is observed during translation of RNA genomes exhibiting overlapping gene arrangements. It usually allows the expression of the viral replicase, the transframe protein in most cases harboring the polymerase or the reverse transcriptase. It has recently been reported (Chung et al., 2008) that TuMV, in addition to synthesizing a large polyprotein that undergoes cleavage, also harbors a frameshift protein embedded in the P3 region of the polyprotein: frameshift leads to the expression of a protein designated P3-PIPO. PIPO is essential for infectivity of the virus, although its precise role has not been established.",

Here, most ribosomes terminate synthesis at the UAG codon to produce the Gag protein, but when termination is suppressed, a glutamine residue from Gln-tRNAGln is incorporated at the level of the UAG codon and elongation continues to form the Gag\u2013Pol product. This latter protein is then cleaved to yield Gag, a protease (whose corresponding gene segment harbors the suppressed UAG codon) and the reverse transcriptase (Yoshinaka et al., 1985). In retroviruses, suppression of termination is controlled by structures within the RNA itself: it requires a few specific nts immediately downstream of the termination codon, followed by a spacer region of a few nts and a hairpin that in some cases forms a pseudoknot. In MLV, suppression of the gag UAG codon depends on specific downstream sequences and on a pseudoknot structure (reviewed in Gale et al., 2000).",

Pseudouiridine (\u03a8) can form a classical base pair with adenosine. The \u03a8 modification at the second anticodon position is necessary to read the UAG codon; it enhances the unconventional G:G interaction at the first anticodon position. Mutating the suppressible TMV UAG codon to UAA leads to virion formation in plants, implying that a tRNA recognizing the UAA codon is present in the host. It was shown that the UAA codon, if placed in the TMV context, was also recognized in vitro by the suppressor tobacco tRNATyr. A second UAG/UAA suppressor is the cytoplasmic tRNAGln with CUG or UmUG (Um is 2\u2032-O-methyluridine) anticodons. tRNAGln is present in almost all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Interaction of the two tRNAGln isoacceptors with UAG or UAA requires an unconventional G:U base pair at the third anticodon position. Probably an unmodified A in the tRNA immediately 3\u2032 of the anticodon facilitates noncanonical base pairing. Other UAG suppressors are the cytoplasmic tRNALeu with a CAA or a CAG anticodon. Here, recognition of the UAG codon requires an unusual A:A pair in the second position of both the CAA and the CAG anticodons and also a G:U pair in the third position of the CAG anticodon.",

Several reports indicate that a tRNATrp with UGA suppressor activity is also present in vertebrates (Cordell et al., 1980, Geller and Rich, 1980). Recognition of the UGA codon by tRNATrp requires an unusual Cm:A pair in the first position of the CmCA anticodon. A tRNACys with a GCA anticodon was isolated from tobacco plants and shown to suppress the UGA in TRV RNA1. Misreading of UGA by tRNACys involves a G:A pair at the first GCA anticodon position.

It first led to examining the initiation, elongation, and termination steps of protein biosynthesis using bacterial extracts and artificial RNAs or bacteriophage RNA genomes as mRNAs, and defining the proteins involved in each step. Thereafter, the availability of cell mRNAs greatly facilitated the study of protein biosynthesis in extracts of eukaryotic cells. This revealed the vast number of protein factors involved in particular at the initiation step of protein synthesis, and the mechanism of action of these factors. In recent years, the sequencing of an ever increasing number of viral RNA genomes shown to function as mRNAs has brought a wealth of new information regarding the fundamental role played by the modulation of the structure of mRNAs in regulating gene expression. It has, for instance, led to numerous studies that consider circularization of mRNAs an important step in promoting protein synthesis. In addition, it has also highlighted the variety of strategies developed by viruses to perturb host protein synthesis so as to favor synthesis of viral proteins. Such evasion of host protein synthesis is now leading to a variety of fascinating studies showing that this involves a complex yet balanced interplay between the host cell translation machinery, the viral mRNA, and the viral proteins resulting from expression of the viral genome. Further experiments will undoubtedly unveil other new venues in this intriguing and multifaceted aspect of cell development.",
