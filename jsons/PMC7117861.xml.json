Feeding difficulties can result from central nervous system immaturity [3\u20135], medical complications [6], and/or cerebral injury [7, 8]. Immaturity can result in inadequate readiness cues, poor state regulation, and poor oral motor reflexes that support feeding [4], but most infants will progress to full oral feedings prior to or close to term equivalent age (38\u201340 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) [9, 10]. While many preterm infants are able to achieve full oral feedings prior to NICU discharge, many continue to have feeding challenges at term equivalent age [11].",

Feeding may also be further complicated by physiological instability of the infant, with bradycardic and desaturation events, which have been associated with an increased risk of aspiration during feeding [9, 13].

Specifically, behavioral responses needed for successful oral feeding, coordination of the sucking pattern, and protection of the airway during swallow improve in a linear fashion with maturity [18]. Studies have demonstrated differences in suck\u2013swallow\u2013breathe coordination [19], oral tone [15], and sucking efficiency among preterm infants and full-term infants [14, 20]. Capilouto and colleagues were able to demonstrate differences in preterm and full-term infants\u2019 feeding using a technology that quantifies nutritive sucking. They observed that preterm infants have higher suck frequency, with shorter suck duration, and less sucking smoothness [21]. However, no studies that we are aware of have defined differences in oral feeding performance, along with differences in specific types of feeding-related behaviors, among full-term infants compared with preterm infants at term equivalent age using standardized feeding assessments of a typical oral feeding in the NICU. Understanding if differences exist, and what aspects of feeding differ, can improve our understanding of feeding challenges that continue to exist among preterm infants at term and enable targeted interventions to optimize outcome.",

Full oral feeding was defined on the infant having full oral intake of their nutritional volume for at least 24 h. For the assessment, each feeder was instructed to feed the infant as they normally would. At the study site, infants were fed by their parents when they were present, and the mode of feeding (breast or bottle) was at their discretion.

Each item receives a letter score, derived from specific standardized criteria outlined in the manual. Scores for each item adjust based on expected performance for each PMA, with the letter score being converted to either 1, 3, or 5 points. A score of 1 on an item reflects a feeding challenge (abnormal) for that PMA, a score of 3 reflects a questionable performance (emerging, immature response, or feeding challenge), and a score of 5 reflects a normal performance. Each item score is then summed for a total raw score. Raw scores can range from 18 to 90, with higher scores indicating better oral feeding performance. Raw scores can then be categorized as normal (77\u201390), questionable (58\u201376), or feeding challenged (18\u201357), based on established ranges.",

Because of the variety of potential feeding behavior manifestations, the items from the assessment were recoded and grouped to ensure optimal exploration of infant feeding capabilities during statistical analysis. See Table 1 for information on how each feeding construct was recoded to define poor arousal, poor rooting and grasp, lack of sucking initiation, poor tongue positioning, suck\u2013swallow\u2013breathe discoordination, inadequate sucking bursts, inadequate suction, tonal abnormalities, discoordination of the jaw and tongue during sucking, lack of positive engagement and/or discomfort during feeding, moderate to severe fluid loss, signs of aspiration, difficulty regulating breathing, inability to finish feeding, and inability to maintain an appropriate state for feeding.",

This study was limited by significant variability in the medical courses of the preterm cohort, along with the timing that the feeding assessment occurred (between 35 and 43 weeks PMA for the preterm group and within 4 days of life for the full-term group). Preterm infants were assessed as close to NICU discharge as possible, but this was as early as 35 weeks PMA in some infants. The preterm group was evaluated during a period of rapid change in feeding skills, which could have introduced variability in performance. While there were no significant differences in the PMA at the time of testing among the preterm and full-term group, it is unclear if the findings would have been different if the preterm group was assessed at a different time period. Likewise, the time period in the hospital after full-term delivery is a period of transition, and feeding performance may or may not have evolved in the days or weeks following the assessment in the full-term group. There were more infants who were breastfed during the assessment in the full-term cohort, and it remains unclear if overall feeding performance could have been better or worse based on whether the infant was breast or bottle-fed. Feeding assessment was limited to one time frame, and this feeding assessment may or may not have been representative of the infant\u2019s general feeding performance. The feeding assessment also could have been impacted by other factors including the feeder, other activities that occurred during the day, hunger, or environmental factors. This study also relied on multiple comparisons, which increases the risk of a Type I error. The sample was derived from studies aimed at exploring early feeding performance, but the current study did not undergo prior power analysis. Despite these limitations, this is the first study, that we know of, to analyze the multiple components of feeding skill performance in preterm infants at term equivalent age compared with full-term infants. The findings aid our understanding of early differences in feeding performance and set the stage for further inquiry.",
