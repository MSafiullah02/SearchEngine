In the absence of effective treatment for COVID-19, women may re-experience associated fears, including involuntary abandonment of dependent children. Persons, households and communities in South Africa have been given information about a highly infectious, sometimes fatal respiratory virus, and been warned that their access to usual medical care might soon be limited if lockdown regulations are not followed [4]. This messaging has created tension for women who need to visit clinics to obtain HIV care and medication while feeling obligated to uphold the lockdown and prevent transmission of COVD-19.",

The consequences of these experience(s) include increased rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [9], and increased likelihood of behavioural avoidance patterns [6, 10\u201312]. An HIV diagnosis may itself aggravate traumatic experiences; many women either relate their HIV diagnosis indirectly to experience of trauma or acquired HIV during a sexual assault [6, 13, 14]. These combined effects, in the context of women living with HIV in peri-urban, often resource-limited settings, may result in delays accessing HIV care, missing clinic appointments and poor medication adherence.",

They cope poorly with additional stressors [11, 15]. Crucially, the lockdown prohibits WLHIV from seeking social support from persons outside of their household, including friends, family and religious groups. These restrictions complicate their journey to health. WLHIV often live in chronically under-resourced communities characterised by high rates of violence, substance use, and limited opportunities for employment. Beyond their immediate health-related needs, women rely on multiple socioemotional resources to cope with their trauma history and living with HIV. Under current restrictions, access to \u201croutine\u201d services, such as social work or counselling, are not considered essential and are disallowed.",

Both globally and in South Africa there have been increased reports of gender-based and domestic violence since the implementation of COVID-19-enforced lockdowns. During the first week of the lockdown in South Africa, 87,000 cases of domestic and inter-personal violence were reported [16]. Individuals are stressed, frustrated and confined in close quarters. Vulnerable persons will be at heightened risk and rates of trauma will escalate. With rates of domestic violence increasing, any coping strategies our future participants may have are at risk of dissipating. Considering that many WLHIV have histories of intimate partner violence and many are currently in abusive relationships, the restrictions placed on their movement may impact their safety. In addition, many women will have to manage an increase in parenting demands\u2014often without any emotional or practical support from their abusive partners. Furthermore, for women who have not disclosed their HIV status to an abusive partner, accessing HIV care may not be feasible without placing them at risk for violence. At a time when continuity of HIV-care engagement could provide reassuring consistency and mediate fears regarding COVID-19, WLHIV may instead be left unsupported and at heightened risk for domestic abuse.",

Indeed, these models can be highly effective in providing support, counselling and psychotherapy [17].

Clinic managers and care providers need to consider this service essential. A second option is to train community health workers who are currently employed to find and track COVID-19 cases within resource-constrained communities, in basic counselling and support. Addressing the mental health needs of WLIHV needs to be as rapid as the general and health response has been. It will require recognition by health system planners, before another epidemic of household trauma exacerbates the physical and mental health conditions of an already traumatised population. Should COVID-19 become a generalised epidemic in South Africa, we will need to address the further impact of morbidity, mortality, and the ensuing grief and loss.",
