Such quantities emerge, e.g., in the B-meson decays into four leptons in the final state; the latter reactions are being studied experimentally [1] [2] [3] [4] , thus requiring a proper theoretical understanding of the B-meson form factors into two currents. By now, there have been only few papers [5, 6] , where B-decays into two lepton pairs have been studied theoretically, using a rather naive model for the B-decay form factors. To obtain reliable predictions for four-lepton B-decays one needs a detailed understanding of the appropriate form factors in the timelike region. In particular, one needs to study the analytic properties of the latter in broad ranges of momentum transfers, including the timelike regions of four-lepton decays, in order to understand where model-independent predictions for such form factors directly from QCD may be obtained. The knowledge of rigorous properties of such form factors from field theory allows one to obtain constraints to be used in building realistic phenomenological models for the amplitudes of various four-lepton decays.",

The corresponding form factors depend on one variable q 2 , q being the momentum of the weak current. Various versions of light-cone QCD sum rules [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] have been applied to obtain the theoretical predictions for such processes. The B-decays into two currents are related to correlation functions containing B-meson in the initial state and one can calculate them in QCD via the B-meson distribution amplitudes [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

Such an approach allows us to avoid techncal complications and to concentrate on the conceptual aspects [23] [24] [25] . Still, we keep the QCD notations of the quark fields b and s and denoteb ands the complex conjugate fields. Here b denotes the b-quark field and s denotes the light-quark field (d, u or s).

If one chooses the procedure of taking first \u01eb \u2192, then one has the picture shown in Fig. 4 : The function F (q 2 , q \u20322 ) is discontinuous on the \"critical\" line and has different left and right limiting values. Moreover, the imaginary (the real) part of the form factor diverges on the left (on the right) from the critical value of the momentum squared. For instance, in Fig. 4 ",

Fig. 5 compares the result corresponding to DA (6.19) for n = 9 and to (6.20) ; for the latter, we fix the parameter \u03b2 B such that \u03be \u22121 for both parametrizations are equal to each other, \u03be \u22121 = 11; this requirement yields \u03b2 = 0.38 GeV. Obviously, for a fixed value of \u03be \u22121 , the form factor is weakly sensitive to the precise shape of the B-meson DA: the sensitivity does not exceed a level of a few percent, at least in the region where our calculation of the form factors may be directly applied to the data. A similar picture is seen for other values of q 2 and q \u20322 . Fig. 6 illustrates the sensitivity of the form factor to the value of \u03be \u22121 of the corresponding B-meson DA \u03c6(\u03be): we compare the form factor evaluated with DAs of (6.19) for n = 9 ( \u03be \u22121 = 11) and for n = 11 ( \u03be \u22121 = 13).

One knows, however, that the QCD confinement distorts this propagator in the soft region of momentum transfers: the Feynman propagator provides a good approximation to the full quark propagator in the region where the quark is highly virtual; in the problem under consideration it is sufficient that the quark virtuality is of order \u039b QCD m b . In practice, when one calculates the \u03be-integral for the form factor in the B-decay kinematics, i.e. for q 2 + q \u20322 \u2264 M B , one always picks up a contribution from the integration region where the quark propagator is not sufficiently hard. This is however not a great problem as soon as the major part of the form factor comes from the integration region where the quark is highly virtual. The region where the quark is soft leads to the appearance of the imaginary part of the form factor. We therefore conclude that the results for the decay form factor obtained by calculating the correlation function (1.3) with Feynman quark and gluon propagators may be directly applied to the analysis of the realistic B-decay in those regions of q 2 and q \u20322 where the imaginary part of the calculated form factor is much smaller than its real part. This criterion may be used as a guiding principle for verifying the theoretical predictions for the form factors of interest and for restricting phenmenological parametrizations.",
