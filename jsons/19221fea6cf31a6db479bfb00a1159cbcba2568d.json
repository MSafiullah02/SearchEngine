The infection, named Coronavirus Disease 2019 , is now spreading worldwide. As of April 16, 2020, the virus had affected more than 2,000,000 individuals and resulted in over 125,000 deaths worldwide. Mortality can be as high as 15% in elderly patients, and/or in patients with comorbidities [1, 2] . Based on the current available data, the incubation period (time from exposure to symptom development) is estimated as between 2 and 14 days [3] . At present, there are no approved treatment options in Europe and no available vaccine. Avoiding exposure by adhering to recommended hygiene procedures, isolation of infected persons and social distancing are the only prevention strategies recommended by the WHO [4] .",

In addition, data from China suggest that patients with cancer have a significantly higher incidence of severe events (including intensive care unit admission, need of assisted ventilation, death) after contracting the virus (39% versus 8% in patients without cancer) [5] . Another study reported that cancer patients appear to be twice as likely to contract infection with SARS-CoV-2 [6] . Importantly, that study suggests that hospital admission and recurrent hospital visits, inherent to cancer patients' management, are potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection [6] . To date, very few data are available on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with hematologic diseases. Only one 47-year-old patient with a lymphoma has been included in a previous report [5] , and two articles have reported on the course of COVID-19 infection in a 39-year-old patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [7] and in a 60-year-old patient with multiple myeloma (MM) [8] . All three patients had a favorable outcome. Nevertheless, these were relatively young, unlike the overall patient population with hematologic neoplasms which is usually aged, comorbid and highly immunosuppressed. These patients are therefore expected to be a particularly vulnerable group for COVID-19. A better characterization of those infected with the virus is important. Here we describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, and outcomes among patients with hematologic disease and COVID-19 infection.",

A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive result on a real-time RT-PCR assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. We reviewed medical records to collect demographic, clinical, and treatment data and outcomes of COVID-19. All laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computerized chest tomography, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. COVID-19 was suspected and screened by PCR in 48 patients with a hematologic disease and the infection was identified in 25. Clinical details on hematologic and treatment history and COVID-19 infection are listed in Table 1 . The median patient age was 72 (range, 40-96) years, 68% were male. The median duration of symptoms before the COVID-19 PCR assay was performed, was 4 (range, 0-22) days. None of the patients had recently traveled to a country with known transmission such as China, Iran, or Italy, but five had direct contact with a COVID-19 positive family member. Among the remaining patients, six were already hospitalized (none of them in the hematology department) at the time of viral infection symptoms' onset due to a fall episode (n = 2), MM diagnosis (n = 3) or accidental cardiac drug overdose (n = 1). Ten patients had one or more outpatient visits to the hematology department, suggesting a possible nosocomial origin of their infection. In the remaining four patients, the origin of COVID-19 infection was unknown.",

This study highlighted the following observations: patients with a hematologic malignancy harbored a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 with ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation, compared to those in the general French population without an underlying medical condition [1] . This translated into a very high mortality (estimated as 40% at 1 month) which we can expect to be even higher with a longer follow-up. Furthermore, fewer than half of the patients were receiving active anti-neoplastic treatment before COVID-19, highlighting that vigilance must remain high in every patient given the long-term immunosuppressive effect of prior therapies. Interestingly, for the majority of the patients, a nosocomial origin was suspected, owing to their hospitalized status or to outpatient visits within the 14 previous days.",
