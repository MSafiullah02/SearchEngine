Sprecher and Fehr (2005) defined compassionate love as an attitude toward others containing feelings, cognitions, and behaviors that are focused on caring, concern, tenderness, and an orientation toward supporting, helping, and understanding the other, particularly when the other is perceived to be suffering or in need. Based on these previous studies, the present study defines compassionate love as an attitude toward others that includes three components, namely, tender feelings toward others (feeling), understanding others (cognition), and putting others before self (behavioral intention).",

Underwood\u2019s model was intended to fit together situational and motivational factors despite differences in focus and disciplinary starting points. In the original model, situational factors are multifaceted and may include emotional, cognitive, physical, social, environmental, and cultural aspects. Motivational factors include motivation and discernment, which are integral parts of the moment when one chooses how to move, to act, and to express something centered on the good of the other. Consequently, compassionate love is revealed in self-giving for the good of others through positive behavior and attitude. It involves having a loving and caring attitude, which may be expressed through facial expressions, body language, and words.",

Affect is a psychological term for an observable expression of emotion that may be indicated through a facial expression or vocal or gestural behavior (American Psychological Association 2006). Positive affect may also include the emotions in actions done with enthusiasm, eagerness, and enjoyment instead of boredom, exhaustion, and tiredness. Positive affect in pastoral ministry refers to zeal in partaking of Christ\u2019s mission in three ways (Congregation for the Clergy 2013; John Paul II 1992; Paul VI 1965). First, as a prophet, it means a passion for proclaiming the gospel in pastoral ministries, such as giving recollection (a spiritual exercise for giving attention to the presence of God in the soul), teaching the Catholic faith, and preaching. Second, as a priest, it refers to zeal in performing sacred functions, such as giving the sacrament for the sick, giving the sacrament of reconciliation, and presiding over Mass. Lastly, as a shepherd, it means eagerness in gathering the people of God and is manifested in pastoral ministries such as ministerial administration or accompanying others through pastoral or spiritual consultation.",

First, family and close friends are considered resources who provide important support for priests in the context of nonwork relationships. Zickar et al. (2008) suggests that support from family and friends is important for the nonwork relationship outcomes of priests. Second, staff are considered significant support resources for priests, helping them enjoy being a priest and be satisfied in their ministry. Third, support from parishioners is considered a buffer from the negative effects of stressors that affect Catholic priests. Fourth, fellow priests are important resources for Catholic priests as well. Virginia (1998) noted that Catholic diocesan clergy experience emotional exhaustion in their life and ministry due to the lack of a social support network such as a priestly community (fellow priests). Lastly, the support of a bishop or other superior has an influence on Catholic priests. Hoge et al. (1995) documented that the lack of support from the priestly community and the lack of sufficient leadership by bishops are some of the key sources of stress in the priestly life and ministry. In the context of Asia, Cornelio (2012) found that relationship problems with bishops challenged priests who were struggling to serve the people in a diocese in the Philippines.",

Three components of priestly commitment might influence compassionate love among Catholic priests. First, affective priestly commitment suggests that priests have an emotional attachment or involvement in the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Second, the normative priestly commitment refers to a moral obligation or a generalized value of loyalty to remain a member of the Roman Catholic Church. Third, the continuance priestly commitment refers to the awareness of the cost of leaving one\u2019s priestly vocation in the Roman Catholic Church. By referring to Underwood\u2019s compassionate love model, it is possible that commitment contributes to one\u2019s capacity to give compassionate love to others.",

In 2017, almost 81.18% of Indonesians (over 261 million people) declared themselves Muslim; 9.87% of the population adhered to Christianity (of which more than 70% were Protestant), 1.69% was Hindu, 0.72% Buddhist, and 0.56% of other faiths (Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics 2017). First, accompanying Catholics, who comprise less than 9 million or 3% of the total Indonesian population, in the midst of multiple religions, with the Muslim faith the largest (Konferensi Waligereja Indonesia 2017), is a challenge for Indonesian Catholic priests. Second, since Indonesia is an archipelagic country with more than fifteen thousand islands (Central Intelligence Agency 2018), geographic problems are also a challenge for Indonesian priests. Indonesian priests are expected to serve Catholics who live on remote Indonesian islands. Lastly, Indonesian priests also accompany Catholic people who are dealing with modern-day problems (e.g., marital life issues, faith and spiritual crises, relationship and work problems, etc.).",

It makes sense that having a persistent desire to remain a priest while simultaneously experiencing a positive mood and vitality enables Catholic priests to give love to others. So, based on all of the above, it seems that well-being can still be considered an important factor in compassionate love among Catholic priests.",

Thus, the study cannot establish causality because it is not experimental. However, given that the factors in the study are difficult to manipulate, the method employed in the study to test the model appears to be most appropriate for examining the possible cause and effect relationship of the factors. Third, the study focused only on priests who were active and good performers in pastoral ministry. The results might be different for priests who are dealing with difficult situations.",

The three components\u2014positive affect in pastoral ministry as a prophet, priest, and shepherd\u2014were found to have items that merged together as expected, forming three different factors, with each factor having good reliability. Since there is no psychological test to measure positive affect in pastoral ministry, this scale may be the starting point for investigating concurrent validity with other existing psychological measures.

If this is achieved, Catholic priests will continue to be eager to do pastoral ministry, and this will have a positive impact on the people they serve.
