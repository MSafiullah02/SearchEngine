No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant.

However, some patients may also develop coagulopathy, then associated with poor prognosis [3] . In a retrospective series of 183 consecutive patients, Tang et al. reported that 71.4% of non-survivors met the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), while only 0.6% of survivors did. In 99 Chinese patients, Chen et al. [4] also reported abnormal \"coagulation function\", including increased D-dimers in 36 patients (36%), decreased prothrombin time (PT) in 30 patients (30%), or increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in 16 patients (16%). Similarly, among 13 patients admitted to ICU, Wang et al. [5] reported that prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. As is the case with sepsis, prophylactic anticoagulation of patients with severe COVID-19 may be recommended [6] . Recent recommendations on coagulopathy management, based on the follow-up of standard coagulation markers (D-dimers, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, and platelet count), have been put forward by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) [7] . In another retrospective study stratifying patients based on sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer level, Tang et al. [8] suggested that heparin would decrease mortality in severe COVID-19 patients who met the SIC criteria or have markedly elevated D-dimers.",

Propensity scores was generated using a multivariable logistic regression model with the group (non-COVID-19 ARDS or COVID-19 ARDS) as the dependent variable and baseline characteristics that were unbalanced between groups or had clinical relevance as the independent variables (age, sex, medical history of malignancies, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, venous thrombo-embolic event, immune diseases, chronic liver diseases, chronic renal diseases, respiratory diseases, SAPS II, SOFA, PaO 2 /FiO 2 on ICU admission, anticoagulant treatment and ECMO). The COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were then paired 1:3 on these propensity scores with a caliper size of 0.1 \u00d7 logit [SD of the propensity score]. In order to take into account the matching, variables were then compared using GEE (generalized estimating equation) models with an unstructured covariance matrix. Binomial distribution was used for binary variables, and Gamma distribution was used for continuous variable. Goodness of fit for Gamma distribution was assessed using histograms and quantiles plots.

However, the coagulation activation pattern was not the same as in our cohort of non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. It was not the same either as in septic shock without DIC: D-dimers levels were less elevated (2.27 mg/L vs. 4.30), PT, aPTT and AT were within normal ranges, and fibrinogen was higher (7.0 g/L vs. 5.6) [12] . Interestingly, while 30-40% of septic shock patients develop DIC [13] , no COVID-19 patient was diagnosed with DIC using ISTH \"overt\" score and only 6 with JAAM-DIC score. Even the SIC score, which should detect patients at risk of developing DIC, was positive in only 22 patients. We can therefore reasonably assume that the mechanisms leading to DIC differ in COVID-19 patients from those usually described in ICU patients. Then, the mechanisms leading to localized thrombosis (PE, stroke or mesenteric infarct) or to circuit device (either RRT or ECMO) thrombosis may not be the same either. Indeed, RRT circuit thrombosis, despite systemic anticoagulation by continuous infusion of heparin and/ or citrate [14] , may be explained by both the very high level of fibrinogen and the ultrafiltration, resulting in higher concentrations inside the dialyzer capillaries, rather than by contact phase activation by the circuit itself [15] . Classical coagulation markers, prothrombin and activated thromboplastin time, and platelet count do not detect the procoagulant state [16] .",

            "text": "The mechanisms involved in thrombosis remain unclear. Endothelial inflammation was obvious, with very high levels of vWF:Ag and FVIII. Profound hypoxemia in the pulmonary capillaries may result in vasoconstriction reducing blood flow and promoting vascular occlusion [18] . Hypoxemia also induces activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are heterodimeric transcriptional factors consisting of HIF\u03b2 subunit, expressed by all nucleated cells, and HIF1\u03b1 and HIF2\u03b1 subunits (for HIF1 and HIF2, respectively). Hypoxia induces HIF2\u03b1 subunits and decreases hydroxylation resulting in inducing or inhibition of many genes, including tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) [19, 20] . We did not measure PAI-1 in our patients, but we could assume that it would be very high, as it is shed by endothelial cells like vWF. In a healthy lung, a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways that controls fibrin deposition and their influence on the viability of the lung epithelium. It is well known that the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) bound to its receptor (uPAR) increases the efficiency of fibrinolysis on epithelial cell surfaces, clearing thereby abnormal fibrin deposits from the lung [21] . Impairment of this fibrinolytic function during lung inflammation results in abnormal accumulations of fibrin in alveolar spaces due to increase in pro-coagulant activity [22] . Accordingly, data of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with ARDS have revealed the presence of fibrin and increased levels of the uPA plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) responsible for a decreased fibrinolytic activity within the alveolar space [23] . Increased PAI-1 levels were measured in the blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients during the 2002-2003 epidemic [24] . A reduced capacity to cleave and remove fibrin deposits corresponds with a poor clinical patient outcome as presence of exudates, composed of fibrin and proteinaceous material, blocks normal gas exchange [25] .",

LA are heterogeneous antibodies detected under various clinical circumstances where cellular damage due to infectious, autoimmune or inflammatory stimuli [27] leads to plasma membrane remodeling including the release of membrane microparticles and the exposure of phospholipids normally not accessible to the immune system. Resulting antibodies have been named anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). Strikingly, such LA/aPL elevations in a major proportion of COVID-19 patients have, however, rarely been observed with other pathologies, which probably reveals significant or massive cellular destruction. Of course, we cannot exclude that some patients were already positive for the LA before COVID-19 infection, since the frequency of non-symptomatic positive LA is higher in the ageing population [28] .",

Moreover, two patients had livedo reticularis and another one had IgM type anticardiolipin antibody at 48 MPL. In our cohort, 29 patients had acute renal failure (ARF) KDIGO3 requiring renal replacement therapy (19.3%) and many had less severe renal failure with proteinuria (data not shown). Renal failure is often present at admission, while hypotension is not. The mechanism of ARF is probably multifactorial. It may be an association of dehydration, vascular leakage, hypoxia and aPL-associated nephropathy. Evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy in our patients is difficult to evidence as renal biopsy was not performed. Systemic inflammation-essentially via IL-6-may contribute to renal injury as observed during influenza A H1N1 [29] and ARDS [30] . ARF acts as an amplification loop [31] . Nevertheless, some patients were admitted with ARF, while dehydration was clinically evident with aqueous diarrhea for few days prior to admission. Interestingly, these patients recover diuresis with hydration without improvement in ARF arguing for an intricate mechanism. Overhydration is a major concern during ARDS, and high venous pressure (aggravated by high levels of PEEP) and venous congestion of the kidneys may also play a role in the development of ARF during ICU stay.",
