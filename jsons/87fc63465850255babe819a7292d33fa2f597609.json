Differentiation from other AFI is difficult due to the non-specific presentation and limited availability of diagnostics. This 3-year study identified independent clinical predictors by day post-illness onset (DPO) at presentation and age-group that distinguish chikungunya cases from two groups: other AFI and dengue. Specimens collected from participants with fever \ufffd7 days were tested for chikungunya, dengue viruses 1-4, and 20 other pathogens. Of 8,996 participants, 18.2% had chikungunya, and 10.8% had dengue. Chikungunya cases were more likely than other groups to be older, report a chronic condition, and present <3 DPO. Regardless of timing of presentation, significant positive predictors for chikungunya versus other AFI were: joint pain, muscle, bone or back pain, skin rash, and red conjunctiva; with dengue as the comparator, red swollen joints (arthritis), joint pain, skin rash, any bleeding, and irritability were predictors. Chikungunya cases were less likely than AFI and dengue to present with thrombocytopenia, signs of poor circulation, diarrhea, headache, and cough. Among participants presenting <3 DPO, predictors for chikungunya versus other AFI included: joint pain, skin rash, and muscle, bone or back pain, and absence of thrombocytopenia, poor circulation and respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms; when PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.Infectious Diseases had no role in the study design, the comparator was dengue, joint pain and arthritis, and absence of thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and nausea were early predictors. Among all groups presenting 3-5 DPO, pruritic skin became a predictor for chikungunya, joint, muscle, bone or back pain were no longer predictive, while arthritis became predictive in all age-groups. Absence of thrombocytopenia was a significant predictor regardless of DPO or comparison group. This study identified robust clinical indicators such as joint pain, skin rash and absence of thrombocytopenia that can allow early identification of and accurate differentiation between patients with chikungunya and other common causes of AFI.",

Patients with chikungunya exhibit joint, muscle, or bone pain, and may also have skin rash, red eyes (conjunctiva), and red swollen joints (arthritis). Up to 20% of cases develop long lasting arthritis, fatigue or psychiatric conditions. We used data from our prospective study to identify signs and symptoms that predict chikungunya. We enrolled 8,996 AFI patients and tested for CHIKV, dengue viruses 1-4 (DENV 1-4), and other pathogens. A pathogen was detected in 55% of participants; 18.2% had CHIKV and 10.8% had DENV 1-4 infections. This study compared the clinical presentation of chikungunya with that of all other AFI and dengue alone. Regardless of timing of presentation, significant predictors of chikungunya were joint pain, muscle, bone or back pain, and red conjunctiva when compared to other AFI, and arthritis, joint pain, skin rash, any bleeding, and irritability, when dengue was the comparator group. Chikungunya patients were less likely than AFI and dengue patients to have low platelets, signs of poor circulation, diarrhea, headache, and cough. By enrolling febrile patients at presentation, we identified unbiased predictors of chikungunya. These findings can assist physicians to clinically diagnose chikungunya and initiate proper patient management.",

Symptoms include high fever, bilateral symmetric joint pain, myalgia, arthritis, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, headache, and nausea or vomiting. Clinical laboratory findings can include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated hepatic transaminases. Rare complications include uveitis, retinitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, bullous skin lesions, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and cranial nerve palsies [5] [6] [7] . Mortality is thought to be a rare outcome [8] . Persons at risk for severe disease include neonates exposed intrapartum, adults >65 years old, and people with chronic medical conditions [9, 10] . While the acute illness typically resolves by the end of the third week, some people have a post-acute phase with arthritis, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric conditions that may last through the third month [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Chronic musculoskeletal symptoms, which are likely mediated by inflammation [13] potentially resulting from viral persistence [18] [19] [20] [21] , may recur or persist more than 3 months after the acute phase of the illness.",

Testing blood for viral RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [26] or anti-CHIKV antibodies by IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) [27] allows for a definitive diagnosis. During outbreaks and in resource poor settings, diagnosis often relies on the identification of clinical features consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition [26] .

Identifying AFI patients who have chikungunya is important for patients who develop post-acute and/or chronic disease. It can also improve patient outcomes by enabling more timely assessment of patients with other AFIs that require early administration of an antibiotic or antiviral drug, or specific anticipatory guidance. Also, identification of patients with CHIKV infection early, while the patient is still febrile (and viremic), may help limit further transmission of CHIKV within households and communities. In this manuscript, we describe clinical predictors of RT-PCR positive chikungunya cases by the timing of presentation and age compared to two groups: all other AFI cases (CHIKV-negative), and RT-PCR positive dengue cases. To do so, we utilized the first three years of data collected from an ongoing clinical study in which patients presenting to the hospital emergency department with AFI were enrolled and tested for evidence of infection with CHIKV, dengue virus 1-4 (DENV-1-4), and 20 other pathogens.",

Beginning in May 2014, specimens collected \ufffd6 DPO were tested by CHIKV-specific, real-time RT-PCR [36] , and those collected \ufffd6 DPO were tested by anti-CHIKV MAC-ELISA [33] . Serum specimens collected \ufffd3 DPO were tested by a pan-enterovirus real-time RT-PCR assay that targets the viral protein 1 (VP1) region [37] . Paired serum specimens from enrollment and follow-up visit were tested by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for Leptospira spp. [38] and by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) for Burkholderia pseudomallei [39] , according to an algorithm that was previously described [29] . The first 250 patients with Leptospira spp. and B. pseudomallei negative specimens and for which paired specimens were available were tested by Indirect Fluorescent Assay (IFA) for Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Coxiella spp. Whole blood and/or acute serum from cases with a reactive IFA were assessed for C. burnetii, R. rickettsii, R. typhi, and/or E. chaffeensis DNA by PCR [29] .",

Cases that were only anti-CHIKV MAC-ELISA positive and CHIKV coinfections were not included in our analysis as laboratory-confirmed chikungunya cases. All other AFI cases included 6,916 laboratory-positive and laboratory-negative AFI cases that were not CHIKV RT-PCR positive (n = 1,499), anti-CHIKV MAC-ELISA positive (n = 136), anti-DENV MAC-ELISA positive (n = 285), dengue indeterminate (n = 51), or co-infected (n = 109) AFI cases. A dengue indeterminate case had a negative acute specimen and no serum collected \ufffd6 DPO available for testing. The number of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya, dengue and other AFI cases were plotted by month and year of illness onset and timing of presentation. Differences in proportions were tested by applying the Chi-square test, and medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Bonferroni correction was used to account for simultaneous multiple comparisons. Multiple imputation was used to predict an independent plausible value for missing values (percent missing ranged from 0.4-8.6%) using generalized linear regression on non-missing variables to create 40 imputed complete data sets [41] . To identify predictors of chikungunya as compared to all other AFI cases and dengue cases separately, stepwise Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) variable selection was used for imputed datasets. Variables retained at least once in the 40 models were included in a pooled Poisson regression model (using weights to account for the pooling) before going through final variable selection [42] . From the final pooled Poisson regression model, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for significant overall (all DPOs), early (<3 DPO), and late (3-5 DPO) predictors, along with any significant interactions with age group (<5-year-old, 5-19-year-old, 20-49-year-old, and \ufffd50-year-old). The final models included the age and the variables listed in S2 Table. The adjusted relative risks (aRR) were calculated by comparing cases with the significant predictor who were CHIKV RT-PCR positive to other AFI cases (or DENV RT-PCR positive), divided by the comparison of cases without the significant predictor who were CHIKV RT-PCR positive to other AFI cases (or DENV RT-PCR positive), and adjusted for the other statistically significant predictors in the models. Data were analyzed using the \"mi\" and \"MASS\" packages from R software (V3.3.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

Thrombocytopenia, respiratory symptoms (i.e., cough, sore throat and rhinorrhea), signs of poor circulation, gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea), and anorexia were early negative predictors of chikungunya when compared to other AFI cases. When compared with the 281 dengue cases that presented <3 DPO, joint pain and red swollen joints were significant early positive predictors of chikungunya in all age groups (Table 4 ). In contrast to the chikungunya vs. all other AFI comparison, skin rash was an early positive predictor (aRR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.22-1.97) only among participants 5-19-years-old in the chikungunya vs. dengue comparison (Table 5) . Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and nausea were significant early negative predictors of chikungunya when compared to dengue cases (Table 4) . Some clinical features were significant predictors of chikungunya compared to all other AFI cases when interacted with age group ( Table 5 ). Report of any bleeding was an independent, positive early predictor of chikungunya among participants <5 years old. Having red swollen joints was a positive predictor of chikungunya among participants >20 years old. Facial and/or neck erythema was a positive predictor among participants >20-years old.",

Chikungunya cases were more likely than other AFI cases to be older and a higher proportion reported having at least one chronic medical condition. This pattern of disease has been seen in other areas with recent CHIKV emergence [43, 44] and may be due to differences in healthseeking behaviors and/or complications among older individuals with preexisting co- Prospective study of acute febrile illness in Puerto Rico morbidities, including osteoarthritis. As has been previously reported, chikungunya cases were more likely than other AFI cases to present early in the clinical course [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] ; differences that were especially pronounced between chikungunya and dengue cases [50] [51] [52] . Whether the difference in the timing of presentation is due to a more abrupt onset of fever and the occurrence of very high fever (\ufffd40\u02daC) among those with chikungunya than dengue remains unknown. In our study, we did not collect information about the degree of fever or the fever curve to be able to confirm these findings. As a clinical syndrome, AFIs are a diagnostic challenge for clinicians especially early in the clinical course when anticipatory guidance and supportive care may pre-empt medical complications. In our study, we identified clinical predictors for RT-PCR-positive chikungunya cases by timing of presentation and patient age using two clinical comparators. While there are a few recent prospective studies that sought to identify predictors of chikungunya using dengue cases [43, 44, 48, [53] [54] [55] or all other AFIs [43, 55] as the clinical comparator, many were biased by restrictive study inclusion criteria [44, 48, [53] [54] [55] including the use of dengue and/or chikungunya case definition [44, 53] . In addition, some studies included only hospitalized cases [44, 46, 50] , or restricted the study to adult [44, 50, 55] or pediatric cases [46, 48] . Lastly, many of these studies were limited by small sample size (i.e., <50 chikungunya cases) [43, 44, 48, 53, 55] , and because of this, other investigators found few or no clinical features that distinguished chikungunya cases from other AFIs [44, 53, 55] .",

            "text": "We identified seven predictors of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya among AFI patients regardless of the timing of presentation or comparison group used including two positive predictors, joint pain and skin rash, and five negative predictors: thrombocytopenia, signs of poor circulation, headache, cough, and diarrhea. Red swollen joints was also a predictor, except for patients aged <5 years when compared to all other AFI. Similarly, leukopenia was a negative predictor, except in adults when compared to all other AFI and in all age groups when compared to dengue. Last, classic signs and symptoms of dengue including headache, eye pain, and signs of poor circulation were negative predictors of chikungunya when compared with dengue. While more recent studies have not found bleeding to be an early predictor of chikungunya, many of the original chikungunya case reports described bleeding among chikungunya cases including epistaxis and petechiae [46, 56, 57] . In our study, a significantly higher proportion of chikungunya cases had skin bleeding (mostly petechiae) when compared to dengue cases, and because of this, any bleeding was a significant positive predictor of chikungunya when compared with dengue for all ages regardless of the timing of presentation. Any bleeding was also a significant positive predictor of chikungunya overall and early in the clinical course among participants <5 years when compared with all other AFI cases. A study by Velasco et al. also identified differences in signs and symptoms by the age of the chikungunya patient in that children (<18 years) were more likely to have rash while those \ufffd18 years were more likely to have bleeding [53] . In our study, this finding was mainly due to differences in the occurrence of skin bleeding, and specifically, petechiae on the lower extremities (44.3% or 97 of 219 chikungunya cases < 5 years had petechiae vs. 8.5% or 203 of 2,383 of all other AFI cases < 5 years old, (P <0.001). While skin bleeding, particularly petechiae, may be challenging to correctly identify especially in patients with darkly pigmented skin, young children with chikungunya were probably more likely to present with petechiae due to the higher incidence of minor lower extremity trauma in this age group. Nevertheless, our study explored petechiae in the lower extremities only and may have missed petechial skin bleeding caused by other AFI that present on the face and upper trunk of young children because of frequent and/or severe cough spells or vomits [58] . In addition, viral genomic studies have identified respiratory viruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and influenza in nasopharyngeal aspirates of young children with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and petechiae [59] .",

We found that for AFI patients of all ages presenting early (<3 DPO) in the clinical course, there were three predictors of chikungunya regardless of the comparison group used. These early predictors included joint pain and the absence of thrombocytopenia and nausea. In addition, having a red swollen joint was a positive predictor in all age groups if dengue was used as a comparator, and in participants \ufffd20 years old when all other AFIs was the comparator. In contrast, skin rash was a positive predictor in all age groups if all other AFI was used as a comparator and only in the 5-19-year-old group if dengue was the comparator. While skin rash as a predictor was somewhat surprising, several similar, albeit smaller, studies found early skin rash to be predictive of chikungunya when compared with dengue cases [43, 46, 48] . Not surprisingly, the absence of respiratory (cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea) or gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia) or signs of poor circulation predicted chikungunya at <3 DPO if all other AFIs was the clinical comparator. Not being leukopenic and absence of nausea were predictive of chikungunya if dengue was the clinical comparator.",

For example, joint, muscle, bone or back pain were no longer predictive of chikungunya while arthritis became predictive in all age-groups, and having pruritic skin became a predictor regardless of the comparison group used. While the absence of thrombocytopenia was a significant predictor of chikungunya regardless of the comparison group used, leukopenia was only a predictor when dengue was the comparator group. Our late chikungunya predictor findings were as expected in that dengue cases are more likely to be leukopenic, thrombocytopenic, and have signs of vascular leakage including nausea and cough at 3-5 DPO [29, 46] ; gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms are uncommon among those with chikungunya [50] .",

Second, our analysis of predictors utilizing dengue as a comparator group may be limited because chikungunya cases presented earlier in the clinical course than dengue cases. However, we still had more, late-presenting chikungunya cases than most studies had cases in total. Last, chikungunya and dengue cases presented at different time periods during the study during two separate outbreaks as described earlier. Due to the increased public awareness of chikungunya during the 2014-2015 outbreak, patients at enrollment (i.e., before the laboratory diagnosis) may have been more likely to report joint pain and perhaps, muscle, bone and back pain than during the 2012-2013 dengue outbreak. This may have biased the reporting of these symptoms.",
