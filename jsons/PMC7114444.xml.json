The infection of humans with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are known since the mid sixities to be associated with respiratory tract i.e. common cold-like diseases. SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-Corona Virus) is a highly aggressive human agent, causing the lung disease SARS, with often fatal outcome (Drosten et al., 2003). This virus appeared as an epidemic in 2003 after it had crossed the species barrier most likely from bats to civet cats and humans demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses to cause high morbidity and mortality in humans (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005). As no treatment was available, the epidemic could eventually be controlled by highly effective traditional public health measures of quarantine and case isolation. The strains HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in 2004 and 2005, respectively (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005). They cause more severe lower respiratory tract infections like bronchiolitis and pneumonia especially in young children (van der Hoek, 2007). In 2012, a new human CoV MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus, previously called \u201cEMC\u201d) emerged from the Middle East with clinical outcomes such as renal failure and acute pneumonia, similar to those of SARS-CoV but with an even higher mortality rate of about 50% (de Groot et al., 2013, van Boheemen et al., 2012, Zaki et al., 2012).",

They account for significant hospitalizations of children under 18 years of age, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. According to a number of international studies 1- 10% of the acute respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 (for review see Abdul-Rasool and Fielding, 2010). These numbers are probably an underestimation with regard to the general population since during routine diagnostic screening for respiratory viruses tests for HCoV are frequently not included. An important aspect of HCoV-NL63 infection is the co-infection with other human coronaviruses, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus or human metapneumovirus (Abdul-Rasool and Fielding, 2010). In children they are associated with acute respiratory tract illness, pneumonia and Croup leading in many cases to hospitalization. In a recent epidemiological study out of 1471 hospitalized children (<2years) 207 (14%) were HCoV-positive (Dijkman et al., 2012). Infection frequencies in children with mild symptoms and in hospitalized children occurred in the order HCoV-OC43 > HCoV-NL63 > HCoV-HKU1 > HCoV-229E. In a large-scale survey on 11,661 diagnostic respiratory samples collected in Edinburgh, UK, between 2006 and 2009, 267 (2.30%) were positive for at least one coronavirus accounting for 8.15% of all virus detections (Gaunt et al., 2010). 11% to 41% of coronaviruses detected were present in samples tested positive for other respiratory viruses (e.g. RSV).",

The most instensely studied anti-viral compounds are directed against viral proteases not present in the mammalian host (Chaudhuri et al., 2011, Chuck et al., 2011, Chuck et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2011). However, clinically licensed antivirals for coronavirus infection are absent. Coronaviruses represent the group of the largest single-stranded RNA viruses with plus strand orientation. In general, RNA viruses replicate at low fidelity and are thus prone to rapid evolutionary changes. Although coronaviruses encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (nsp14 ExoN) increasing replicative robustness of its large genomes, mutations within this domain increase mutation rates significantly (Smith and Denison, 2013). Virus replication depends on a variety of host factors (de Haan and Rottier, 2006, Vogels et al., 2011, Wang and Li, 2012) which represent potential antiviral targets. These might be more preferable targets than viral proteins as development of resistance is much less likely.",

            "text": "In a recent study we performed a genome-wide SARS-CoV yeast-two-hybrid interaction screen with human cDNA libraries identifying human immunophilins (including cyclophilins [Cyps] and FK506-binding proteins [FKBPs] as interaction partners of CoV non-structural protein 1 [Nsp1] (Pfefferle et al., 2011). A pronounced feature of most mammalian cyclophilins is their ability to bind the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA). We showed that the drug acts as a replication inhibitor of a number of human (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) and animal coronaviruses (Feline CoV [serotypes I and II], porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) suggesting host cyclophilins as targets for pan-coronavirus inhibition (Pfefferle et al., 2011). Inhibition of SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and in addition of Mouse Hepatitis virus (MHV) was subsequently also confirmed by de Wilde et al. (2011). Inhibition of feline CoV replication was also found by Tanaka et al. (2012). Similarly, we showed that FK506 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E and the dependence of HCoV-NL63 on FKBP1A/B (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Cyclophilins and FKBPs represent large, independent families of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases, EC number 5.2.1.8) thus exerting important functions on folding, maturation and trafficking of proteins within the eukaryotic cell (Blackburn and Walkinshaw, 2011, Davis et al., 2010). Both CsA and FK506 act as tight-binding, reversible and competitive inhibitors of the active site of these enzymes (Fischer et al., 1989). Physical interaction of cyclophilins with viral proteins, and thus replication sensitivity to CsA have been shown for several viruses, e.g. the capsid proteins of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) (Strebel et al., 2009, Ylinen et al., 2009) and Human Papilloma virus (HPV) types 16 (Bienkowska-Haba et al., 2009), the N protein of Vesicular stomatitis Virus (Bose et al., 2003), the NS5a of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (Fernandes et al., 2010, Fischer et al., 1989), the NS4A protein of the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (Kambara et al., 2011), the NS5 protein of West Nile virus (Qing et al., 2009) and the M1 protein of influenza A virus (Liu et al., 2009). The most prominent cyclophilins thought to be involved are CypA and CypB. PPIase-independent activities of CsA and FK506 exerted by gain-of-function, result from the binary complexes formed by binding of the drugs to Cyps and FKBPs, respectively. Based on the inhibition of the protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin, these complexes block the cellular calcineurin (CaN)/NFAT pathway thereby interfering with T-cell activation and Il-2 production. Chemically changed derivatives covering specific side-chain modifications, the so-called non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine or FK506 analogues, can discriminate between alternative signalling pathways either based on PPIase- or CaN-inhibiting functions.",

Inhibition of the CaN phosphatase, the influence on cell-based NFAT reporter gene activity and NFAT translocation by the drugs (Table 2) have been performed using published procedures (Pfefferle et al., 2011, Prell et al., 2013). While the IC50 values for PPIase inhibition were similar to that of CsA, compound 2 (57.5 \u00b1 6.9 nM) showed a higher IC50 value indicating lower binding affinity, but inhibition was still found in the low nanomolar range. CnA activity could not be inhibited at all by binary PPIase/drug complexes of 1, 2, 6. In contrast, CnA activity was weakly inhibited at very high concentrations of the drug/CypA complexes as indicated by IC50 values in the range of 10 \u03bcM for compounds 3 (IC50 6.9 \u03bcM), 4 (IC50\n \u223c 10 \u03bcM) and 5 (IC50\n > 10 \u03bcM)). In addition, these derivatives also demonstrated low ability (IC50 10 \u03bcM, 1.3 \u03bcM and 1.2 \u03bcM, respectively), compared with CsA (IC50 1.6 nM), to reduce the NFAT-driven reporter gene expression in a luciferase-coupled NFAT reporter gene assay indicating a greatly diminished immunosuppressive activity in a cellular assay. Although, peptides 4 and 5 showed higher CnA inhibition in vitro NFAT inhibition was remarkable indicating a gain of CaN effects in vivo. The 45% NFAT inhibitory activity at 10 \u03bcM of 3 still represents a 5000-fold lower influence of the CsA derivative on NFAT-regulated signaling pathways as compared to CsA.",

HeLa 93 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a NFAT-GFP fusion construct under the control of the CMV promoter (Fig. 2\n). Upon Ca2+ mobilization by ionomycin the cellular phosphatase CaN dehosphorylates the NFAT transcription factor which is subsequently translocated to the nucleus. As the cells are not synchronized NFAT-GFP translocation is not expected to occur simultaneously explaining minor transfer efficiencies in some cells. The Cyp-binding immunosuppressants CsA, CsD and the FKBP-binding FK506 induce the binding as protein complexes to CaN thus inactivating its phosphatase activity. As a result NFAT is not transferred to the nucleus. Complexes of the modified drugs 1\u20136 with both types of PPIases, i.e. Cyp/modified CsA or FKBP/modified FK506 derivative complexes, have a greatly reduced potency to inhibit CaN and thus might allow the translocation of NFAT to the nucleus and the transcriptional regulation of immune genes. Consequently, ALV, NIM811 and the whole series of newly synthesized drug derivatives 1\u20136 clearly allow NFAT-GFP translocation to the nucleus and can be thus considered as non-immunosuppressive under these assay conditions (Table 2). In conclusion, in three different assays all synthetic drug derivatives proved to be inert or nearly inert in the suppression of the cellular immune response at an almost unchanged binding and inhibitory potency against the PPIase activity of the respective drug receptor.",

The CypB KD was demonstrated (Fig. 5A) using a polyclonal rabbit anti-CypB antibody. For control the housekeeping gene Lamin B was probed with a polyclonal goat anti-Lamin B antibody. As Lamin B levels showed no differences in Caco-2wt, Caco-2sh control and both knockdown cells, CypA was barely detectable while CypB was completely reduced.

            "text": "Common and in many cases very successful antiviral therapeutic approaches adhere to the use of drugs that inhibit viral replication by directly acting on viral components important for the viral life cycle like reverse transcriptases, proteases, integrases etc. A drawback of these drugs is the high mutational susceptibility of the viral genomes due to the poor proofreading activities of viral replicative enzymes, especially of RNA viruses. These difficulties might be circumvented by new, promising therapeutic drugs targeting host factors involved in viral entry, replication, assembly and release, or in general cellular functions such as protein translation and folding. A well characterized example is inhibition of hepatitis C virus infection in cell culture models and humans by host-targeting agents (Zeisel et al., 2013). Cyclophilins are a class of mostly intracellular enzymes required for the correct folding and function of a various cellular and also viral proteins (von Hahn et al., 2011). CypA has been shown to bind to several HIV-1 and HCV proteins and being essential for replication of several viruses which can be inhibited by CsA and non-immunosuppressive derivatives thereof (Baugh and Gallay, 2012, Daelemans et al., 2010, Fassati, 2012, Frausto et al., 2013, Gallay, 2012, Membreno et al., 2013). In HCV patients safety and efficacy has been shown for the three Cyp inhibitors ALV, NIM811 (both from Novartis) and SCY-635 (SCYNEXIS) in phase I and phase II trials. ALV is the first-in-class and the most advanced cyclophilin inhibitor with clinical proof-of-concept including phase III randomized clinical trials (Flisiak et al., 2013, Gallay and Lin, 2013, Membreno et al., 2013).",

We further showed inhibitory action of FK506 on the three human CoVs. The main goal of our study was to test and compare the inhibitory effect of the chemically difficult-to-synthesize cyclosporines ALV and NIM811 with a set of drug derivatives 1\u20135 which result from the chemically well-tractable side chain in position 1 of CsA. In addition, the FK506 derivative 6 should provide a first indication of feasibility of expanding the concept of antiviral non-immunosuppressive CypA inhibitors into the field of FKBP inhibitors. Data on the inhibition of HCoV-NL63 replication were compared with the immunosuppressive immunophilin binders CsA, CsD and FK506. All derivatives inhibit the PPIase activity of their respective binding proteins thus preventing their catalytic function in assisting client proteins to fold correctly. When compared with already known non-immunosuppressive drugs, the new compounds were not only more easily accessible by chemical synthesis but also showed a favorable ratio of PPIase inhibition to cellular toxicity. All compounds were tested in an NFAT-GFP nuclear translocation assay (Fig. 2). Upon mobilization of Ca2+ by ionomycin NFAT-GFP remained in the cytoplasm in the presence of CsA, CsD and FK506. This indicates that the CypA/CsA, CypA/CsD or FKBP/FK506 complexes inactivate the CaN phosphatase thus preventing NFAT dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation which constitutes the basis for immunosuppression. For CsD it is clear that it exerts a rather strong immunosuppressive activity as opposed to earlier reports ascribing only about 10% of the CsA activity to the molecule (Sadeg et al., 1993a). In the presence of ALV, NIM811 and all the newly synthesized drug derivatives 1 to 6 NFAT migrated to the nucleus within minutes confirming their non-immunosuppressive activity. The new set of drugs was also characterized in vitro with respect to inhibition of CypA in a protease-coupled PPIase assay, CnA and NFAT assay and cell permeability. The potency of PPIAse inhibition was comparable to CsA. Only in the case of compound 2 it was increased by about sixfold. The IC50 values of CnA inhibition was achieved for CsA at 0.05 \u03bcM whereas for three of the new compounds 138-fold to 200-fold higher concentrations were needed.",

Taken together, all the derivatives inhibited virus replication in the low micromolar range similar to our previous report on the inhibition of various human and animal CoVs with CsA (Pfefferle et al., 2011). Interestingly, inhibition of HCV with CsA, ALV and NIM811 is commonly observed at nanomolar concentrations with ALV as the most effective compound. We have no explanation for this but it can be speculated that in the case of HCV the interaction of viral proteins and cyclophilin A is more sensitive to the inhibitors.

The protein decreased at 1.25 \u03bcM and it was not detectable any more at concentrations above 5 \u03bcM. Thus, there is a clear inhibitory effect of the different peptides on N protein expression and virus replication. Whether inhibition is a result of lacking cyclophilin interaction with Nsp1 or another viral protein cannot be decided at the current stage. As the N protein of SARS-CoV was reported to bind to CypA (Luo et al., 2004) and CypA is incorporated into SARS-CoV particles (Neuman et al., 2008) the inhibitors might also act directly on CypA/N-protein complexes, if these also exist in HCoV-NL63.

While our CoV data on CsA inhibition (Sch\u00f6pf et al., 2010) were basically confirmed, the report claims that neither CypA nor CypB are required for replication of SARS-CoV and Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) on the basis of siRNA PPIA and PPIB knockdown experiments. However, both siRNA knockdowns were rather incomplete in terms of the residual CypA or CypB protein level leaving enough PPIase activity in the infected cells to support viral replication. At least for HCoV-NL63 we clearly demonstrate that in lentivirally produced knockdown cells CypA but not CypB is the required molecule. Interestingly, showing a similarly poor knockdown of PPIA the same authors claim in a follow-up study on arteriviruses that PPIA is the required cyclophilin for nidovirus replication (de Wilde et al., 2013). Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae are both families within the order of Nidovirales. They are both positive-stranded with similar genome organization and genome length of 27 to 32 kb and 13 to 16 kb, respectively, and they share a number of enzymatic functions. Since both families are sensitive to CsA the involvement of cyclophilins in nidovirus replication as a general principle is reasonable.",

The interaction of SARS-CoV Nsp1 in Y2H and in mammalian protein-binding assays with several cyclophilin isoforms suggests the potential involvement of additional cyclophilins in the infection process. It has to be examined systematically whether CypA and further cyclophilins bind to other viral proteins. Furthermore, knowledge about the regulatory role of the catalytic activity of the PPIase subfamilies of cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins, both of which were shown here to be critical in the viral replication process requires identification of their protein substrates in the coronaviral background.",
