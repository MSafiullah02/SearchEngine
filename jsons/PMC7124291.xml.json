Historically, bioterrorism events have been localized, resulting in few illnesses and deaths. Yet, unlike most natural disasters, they engender widespread fear and, as with pandemics, may cause health care workers to consider their own risks. Without these first responders, social stability could deteriorate as the public learns that health care workers are abandoning their professional roles. Thus, how health care workers respond during a crisis may have broad social consequences and so must be an element of any comprehensive disaster planning strategy.",

An appeal to virtue ethics typically suggests that physicians should practice self-effacement, placing their patients\u2019 interests ahead of their own. 28 By extension, this means placing their duty to patients above their duty to family members and, to some extent, above even their own safety.
