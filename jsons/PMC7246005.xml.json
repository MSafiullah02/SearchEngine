Additionally, radiation oncology departments have adopted more hypo-fractionated treatment schedules to decrease patient time in the clinic9, 10, 11, 12. MRI-guided radiation therapy with daily adaptation is an approach that aids in dose escalation with shorter treatment regimens13\n,\n14. However, staffing requirements for daily adaptation include a radiation oncologist, medical physicist, and 2-3 radiation therapists in close proximity for extended periods of time while sharing common equipment. Possible infection or reallocation of certain specialty team members, such as radiation oncologists, could limit the use of these specialty care procedures. To limit this possibility, new digital care and coverage practices are needed to reduce in-person interactions and subsequent transmission risks for adaptive radiotherapy (ART).",

            "text": "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ART team included two radiation therapists, an advanced practice radiation therapist (APRT), a medical physicist, and a radiation oncologist. Department policies, modeled from national guidelines for SBRT and prior ART workflow publications15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, require physician presence at every fraction for image approval, contour review, plan approval, gating window approval and to direct treatment. Physicist presence is required for contour review and assignment, plan generation, quality assurance, motion management, and troubleshooting. Our department delivers an average of 4-6 ART treatments a day on an MRI-guided linac, MRIdian (ViewRay, Oakwood Village, OH). The ART process is as follows. The patient is positioned in room by the therapy team, followed by volumetric MRI acquisition with registration and couch shift performed by the therapists. For first fraction SBRT or hypo-fractionated treatments, the physician is physically present for registration approval and returns after adapted plan generation. The APRT begins contouring, while the medical physicist arrives during this process, verifying contour integrity. Once contouring is complete, the physicist performs any necessary additional contouring and generates the adaptive plan. The physician is then called back to the machine to review contours and the plan. Once approved, the medical physicist and therapists perform pre-treatment QA. Lastly, all members of the ART team review the pre-treatment real-time MRI cine with the physician providing the final approval of gating parameters. Both the physician and physicist are required to remain readily available during the treatment delivery.",

The engineer could then gain access to the remote computer to create a ScreenConnect (ConnectWise, Tampa, FL) session with the treatment delivery system (TDS) that only he or she could create. Once the TeamViewer connection was used, the vendor engineer could not log back in unless a new password was created. The physician can then remotely access the remote computer via a Remote Desktop Connection to view and gain control of the TDS user interface (UI) via the ScreenConnect software.

Once ready, the physician called the therapy team via telephone, enabling verbal communication during the remote process. Since simultaneous control of the TDS UI is not advised during this process, the physician would announce when he or she would gain control of the TDS UI. At that point, the ART process was similar to the pre-COVID-19 process where the physician could control the cursor to review setup, adjust registration, contour, review dose, and review/adjust gating parameters just as he or she would if physically present at the machine. A physicist was required to be physically present during all remote steps and to perform dose calculations.

For the five remote physician-contoured ART fractions, the average time from registration to treatment delivery was 25.1\u00b17.5min. The sites treated using the remote coverage practice included 9 liver, 3 pancreas, and 2 adrenal cases from 6 different patients. For the 20 patients without remote coverage, the average time from registration completion to treatment delivery was 29.2 \u00b1 9.8min (median = 23.5 min). The sites analyzed for in-person coverage include 15 pancreas, 4 liver, and 1 lung case from 10 different patients. A distribution of the adaptive process times are shown in Figure 3\n.",

There were no hardware or software limitations that would prevent implementation in other radiation oncology departments with the MRIdian MR-Linac, and potentially with other vendors as well. This novel remote coverage practice provides flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic due to staffing restrictions from illness or reallocation to other departments for clinical care. It is especially useful if a physician has been exposed to a COVID-19 patient but is asymptomatic and thus clear to work per hospital policy. The ability for physicians to contour and approve plans remotely is a high standard of physical distancing in these increased risk scenarios. With the physician working remotely, the potential of spread within the department is decreased since the physician has more interactions with a variety of groups, including patients, in the department.",

Understanding the risks presented in these previous publications while incorporating more verbal communication during the remote physician coverage practice contributed to leadership and compliance support. In addition to real-time remote decision making, cyber security concerns for direct remote control of the TDS over an internet network also posed an obstacle. Collaboration with our IT group and vendor was paramount to ensure proper security of the system and limit the chance of unauthorized access to the TDS. Requiring that both the vendor engineer and physicist to have login credentials at separate steps in the process to initiate remote connection also increased security and lowered the possibility of an individual mistakenly gaining access to the TDS.",

The average times of the adaptive processes were within 5 minutes of each other; the remote physician coverage practice being less time consuming. Since the remote coverage practice was implemented after our department instituted policies to decrease patients on treatment, it is difficult to determine if remote physician coverage was faster or if these times are a result of decreased clinical activity. Our physicians typically cover multiple radiopharmaceutical procedures, consults, follow-ups and on-treatment visits, in addition to their ART coverage roles. Also, some adaptive cases are more challenging than others requiring more time in the adaptive process to achieve an appropriate plan which would not average out over 14 fractions. Regardless of needing more data to confirm its timeliness compared to our traditional practice, we were able to eliminate upwards of 20-30 minutes of physician time physically at the machine, thus limiting in-person social interactions associated with risk of COVID-19 transmission.",

In a time where proximity can result in morbidity or mortality, it is a secure and efficient practice to continue providing high quality and shortened treatment schedules for radiation oncology patients. Outside of a pandemic setting, remote physician coverage within a department may provide faster responses from physicians who may be located elsewhere in the radiation oncology department. Providing remote coverage technology may also increase the accessibility and relative ease for physicians to cover their patient\u2019s adaptive treatment throughout the course of radiotherapy, thus limiting cross-coverage. In a scenario where an institution does not have an APRT, a dosimetrist, physicist, or another physician located in the department can assist in contouring and/or other workflow steps based on their established process. The reliance on IT support and the vendor can make access to this technology more difficult if a certain IT expertise or vendor support is not readily available during implementation or treatment setup. Further collaboration is needed with vendors, especially those without remote capabilities, to improve and/or utilize this technique on all adaptive platforms. Even without remote control capabilities, remote view-only of the treatment delivery is possible with commercially available products23, thus facilitating some form of remote coverage practice on other platforms for the time being.",
