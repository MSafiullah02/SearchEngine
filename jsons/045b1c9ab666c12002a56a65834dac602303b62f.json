Positive response to systemic glucocorticoids and IVIG was reported in a single case of an adult patient with coronavirus fulminant myocarditis. 9 Remdesivir has shown promise with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, and early reports of positive clinical response; however, trials are still underway to establish clinical efficacy. 10 Additionally, anakinra has been applied with a favorable safety profile in adults with myocarditis from other causes. 11 Our patient did not undergo a myocardial biopsy, so we cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 was directly responsible for myocardial injury or myocarditis. However, testing for a number of common infections often implicated in myocarditis was negative, except Parvovirus (low level viremia with a positive IgG), and Epstein-Barr virus viremia (with positive antibody to NA and capsid IgG), which both likely represent past infection with reactivation in the setting of acute illness.",

The two potential mechanisms resulting in inflammation are direct viral invasion or immune mediated injury. 1 In our case, the patient had significantly elevated inflammatory markers, no other known risk factors for conduction disease, and a normal baseline ECG. With therapy, his inflammatory markers trended down (figure 3), and his episodes of heart block resolved, indicating that inflammation is likely the main etiology of conduction disease in our patient.",

Compared to our patient, she had a normal echocardiogram. Our patient exhibited evidence of cytokine storm, with elevated ferritin, CRP and procalcitonin, as well as markedly elevated soluble IL-2 receptor (14,800 pg/mL, ref \u2264 1033), CXCL9 (1575 pg/mL, ref \u2264 121), IL-18 (1427 pg/mL, ref 89-540) and elevated IL-6 (44 pg/mL, ref \u2264 5). The child's only pre-existing condition was pityriasis lichenoides chronica. Although there exists debate about the etiology of pityriasis lichenoides chronica, it can be characterized by benign clonal T-cell lymphoproliferation, which may arise as an aberrant immune response to an antigenic trigger, such as a viral infection. 8 Whether this history suggests an underlying immunologic phenotype that contributed to the patient's hyperinflammatory state in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be determined.",
