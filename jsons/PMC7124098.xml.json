Since the isolation of the prototype murine virus in 1949 (Cheever and Daniels 1949), viruses in the subfamily Coronavirinae have been recognized primarily for causing a wide range of economically significant diseases in farm animals and domesticated pets, while the two known human coronaviruses, Human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and Human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) first described in the mid-1960s (Hamre and Procknow 1966; Tyrrell and Bynoe 1965), were considered a mundane seasonal cause of the common cold. Coronaviruses were catapulted onto the world stage when the World Health Organization (WHO) announced in April 2003 that a new coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), never seen in humans before, was the cause of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (WHO 2003a). Since the SARS epidemic, coronaviruses have been regarded as emerging pathogens, and as a result, three new species in humans, Human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), Human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\n, have been described (van der Hoek et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2005; Zaki et al. 2012; de Groot 2013).",

Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS-CoV emerged, swept around the globe via routes of international air travel, and caused 8,098 SARS cases in 26 countries with 774 deaths. This strained the healthcare system in the countries with infections and led to travel restrictions and significant effects on the global economy (WHO 2004a). On July 5, 2003, the WHO declared the chain of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV in the epidemic broken (WHO 2003c). Since July 2003, SARS infection has been documented on several occasions. Three incidents were attributed to breaches in laboratory biosafety. The fourth incident involved four community-acquired cases attributed to animal or environmental exposure in three and an undetermined source of infection in the fourth (Liang et al. 2004).",

They primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections that are more common in children than in adults, and they account for an estimated 15 % of adult colds and up to 35 % of upper respiratory tract infections during peak viral activity. Less commonly, they are associated with lower respiratory tract disease in infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly (Gerna et al. 2006; Principi et al. 2010; van der Hoek 2007). In late 2012, HCoV-EMC was isolated in a 60-year-old male who presented with acute pneumonia, subsequently developed renal failure, and had a fatal outcome (Zaki et al. 2012). From discovery to mid-September 2013, HCoV-EMC, renamed MERS-CoV, (de Groot 2013) caused 132 laboratory-confirmed cases of severe acute pneumonia including 58 deaths. (WHO 2013).",

Cryo-electron microscopy reveals an outer envelope diameter of 85 \u00b1 5 nm with 20 nm club-shaped surface projections, an exceptionally thick, 7.8 \u00b1 0.7 nm envelope and a loosely wound, helical nucleocapsid separated from the envelope by a 4 nm gap. Certain structural proteins are common to all coronaviruses: the spike glycoprotein S, an envelope glycoprotein that mediates receptor-binding and membrane fusion; the envelope spanning glycoprotein M, which contributes to the thickness of the envelop; the envelope protein E, which has been identified as a virulence factor SARS-CoV; and the nucleocapsid protein N, with its function in genome encapsidation, RNA synthesis and translation, and as a type I interferon antagonist (Fig. 13.2). Additional accessory proteins vary by species; for SARS-CoV, structural proteins 3a, 6, and 7 and nonstructural proteins nsp2\u20135 and nsp9 have been described (Goldsmith et al. 2004; King et al. 2011; Neuman et al. 2006).\n\n\n",

Patients entered a crisis phase starting at approximately day 8, and most patients resolved IFN responses at crisis and expressed adaptive immune genes as they recovered. In contrast, patients with poor outcomes demonstrated deviated ISG and immunoglobulin gene expression levels, persistent chemokine levels, and deficient anti-SARS spike antibody production, suggesting a malfunction in the switch from innate to adaptive immunity (Cameron et al. 2007).",

Cases of short duration, 10 days or less, demonstrate acute-phase DAD characterized by hyaline membranes lining alveolar walls, interstitial and airspace edema, mild chronic interstitial inflammation, and vascular congestion (Fig. 13.4). Bronchiolar injury is evidenced by luminal collections of fibrin associated with loss of cilia, denudation of bronchiolar epithelium, and deposition of fibrin on exposed basement membranes. Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibit organizing-phase DAD characterized by interstitial and airspace fibroblast proliferation accompanied by repair including type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and airway-centered squamous metaplasia. Hyperplastic type II cells show marked cytologic change, including cytomegaly, nucleomegaly, clearing of nuclear chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Alveolar spaces contain a combination of macrophages and desquamated pneumocytes including multinucleated forms of both. Acute bronchopneumonia is a common feature in organizing-phase DAD, and fibrin thrombi may also be present. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions have been variably reported, but SARS lacks a unique tissue response and cytopathic effect, making diagnosis by light microscopy alone difficult. After several weeks there can be progression of the organizing phase to the fibrotic phase, with extensive restructuring of the lung parenchyma and development of honeycomb lung (Franks et al. 2003).\n\n",

In the absence of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV anywhere in the world, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection should be considered only in patients who require hospitalization for radiologically confirmed pneumonia and who have an epidemiologic history that raises suspicion of SARS-CoV infection. Suspicion is heightened when the patient, within 10 days of onset of illness, has a history of recent travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or close contact with ill persons with a history of travel to these areas, or is employed in an occupation at risk for SARS-CoV, or is part of a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV is available, including antibody detection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the positive predictive value of a diagnostic test is very low in the absence of person-to-person transmission worldwide, and the CDC recommends testing be performed judiciously and in consultation with local or state health departments (CDC 2005).",
