These are small intracellular agents that contain only one type of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) and are not replicated outside the host cell. Viruses cannot replicate on their own. However, it is a compulsory intracellular parasite because it can replicate in a host cell. When they cannot find a host cell, it is transformed into a crystalline structure and can remain for a long time. The genetic materials of the viruses called genome may consist of single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA. The genetic existence of viruses, which is either DNA or RNA, is surrounded by a sheath made of a protein called capsid. Therefore viruses are composed of nucleoproteins [2]. The replication process of viruses that takes place in a host is exceptional for retroviruses [3]. For example, the genome of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has RNA, but after an interaction with a host cell, it creates a DNA copy [3]. Viruses replicate themselves using the host cell\u2019s metabolism and may mutate during copying. The mutation causes an increase in genetic diversity. Thus viruses can easily adapt to different environmental conditions. As was mentioned earlier, a virus uses host cells to create viral proteins and new virus particles; those new particles are named as virions, which leave the host cell and can infect other cells [1]. Bacteriophage is a type of virus which infects bacteria [1]. Viruses do not have an enzyme system. In their structure, digestive enzymes can only be found to dissolve the membrane of the cell (host cell) into which they will enter. Viruses are not affected by antibiotics because they do not have enzyme systems [4], [5]. There are wide varieties of virus families that are related to different human diseases, for example, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, and Adenoviridae that are DNA viruses, and Retroviridae, Astroviridae, and Rhabdoviridae that are RNA viruses [6].",

Viral infections have been shown to be the cause of an acute disease that does not require hospitalization in developed countries and the cause of death and permanent disability among developing countries, especially among infants and children. For instance, varicella-zoster virus, which is a member of Herpesviridae family, causes chickenpox disease generally in children and herpes zoster in adults [6]. Viruses as well as viral infections can be transferred between people directly, but also contaminated water and/or food consumption is another way for infection [7]. Viral gastroenteritis, considered the cause of deaths of almost 1 million children under 5 years of age every year, is a very common foodborne infection [7]. On the other hand, the transmission of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is only possible with the contact with body fluids of an infected person [8]. Viruses infect not only humans but also plants and animals. Citrus tristeza virus which is a member of Closteroviridae family infects citrus species and can cause serious diseases in trees that result with fruit loss and death of citrus trees [9]. Rabies virus from Rhabdoviridae family is a causing agent for rabies which is a zoonotic disease (a disease that can be transferred from animals into humans), and it is considered a serious risk to human and animal health by World Health Organization (WHO) [10]. Some data suggest that the broad spectrum of already established viral diseases can be extended to involve other serious human diseases, such as juvenile diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, various neurological and immunological disorders, and some tumors [11].",

It allows increasing extremely small amounts of DNA such as a single gene sequence to a million copies in vitro conditions using enzymes [12], [13]. By this means enough amount of DNA is provided for further analyses from a template [13]. In addition to a template DNA, primers, Taq polymerase, nucleotides, and a thermocycler are necessary for PCR process [13]. PCR is a significant technique for not only measuring viral nucleic acids but also for medical diagnosis, plant industry, environmental studies, and gene therapy [13]. PCR is one of the most commonly used methods for the detection of viral nucleic acids. Using PCR, we can determine the identity and/or quantity of viral genomes of virions and infected cells [12], [14]. PCR, as a sensitive method, allows searching multiple possible viruses in samples and recognizing virus groups through common sequences [14]. Despite all those advantages, it is really hard to prevent patient samples which will be used for diagnostic PCR analysis from contamination and that can be considered a setback [14].",

ELISAs involve simple enzyme assays with specificity of antibodies using antigens or antibodies linked to an easily assayed enzyme. The basic principle of ELISA technique is radioimmunoassay process that involves a tagged antibody in order to detect antigens [14], [21]. An enzyme bound with a substrate, a fluorescent molecule, or a radioactive isotope can be described as the tag [14]. ELISA has been used in various fields such as environmental studies in order to detect pollutants, food industry in order to detect toxins or allergens, and medical studies in order to detect pharmaceuticals, disease markers [22]. When we approach ELISA in terms of viruses, it can provide the detection of a virus or an antibody from a sample of a patient infected by viruses [14]. The quantity of viruses from a cell culture/sample or a specific antibody to a specific viral pathogen can be detected using ELISA [14]. Those studies are very crucial for diagnostics [22]. ELISA is a much faster method than immunoblotting to detect a specific viral protein. These are considered highly sensitive methods that can detect very low amounts of protein. On the other hand, ELISA tests can sometimes be quite expensive due to the cost of reagents being used [23]. Direct ELISA, indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA, and competitive ELISA are the different types of ELISA tests which are used for different scientific fields [14], [21], [22].",

Some viruses, such as influenza virus, rabies virus, rubella virus, mumps virus, and measles virus, have hemagglutinin surface proteins that attach to surface glycoproteins of RBCs [25]. HA is a method which relies on the fact that many viruses contain proteins that can bind and agglutinate RBCs. The principle of this assay is simple; however, sample preparation is considered laborious and presents some drawbacks [26]. HA is one of the most widely used techniques in order to detect the presence and quantity of viruses in various samples [24], [25]. However, it cannot give information about the level or measure of viral infectivity [24]. HA is also used for detecting the antibody levels against specific viruses in patient samples. The presence of specific antibodies will prevent the hemagglutination of RBCs by binding the viruses [25]. The results of HAs are given as hemagglutination unit (HAU) [27]. In an assay, in various samples, the amount of viruses in the one that can agglutinate all RBCs is described as 1 HAU [27].",

In order to produce a cell culture the most significant thing is doing all the work under sterile conditions [14]. First step of producing a cell culture is removing and mincing the required tissue. After that, different enzymes such as collagenase are applied to the tissue for degradation of extracellular matrix and releasing cells. Then centrifugation step is applied. Later, cells and growth media are combined with culture dishes and contained in an incubator with humidity, 37\u00b0C temperature and 5% CO2. Lastly, cells grow and divide by linking to the dish [14]. Cell culture-based virus isolation has been accepted as a \u201cgold standard\u201d in the detection and identification of viruses and is the technique by which all other test methods have been compared [35].",

In other respects, Adeno-associated virus is used as therapeutic gene delivery vector [58]. B19 virus is a parvovirus which is the cause of erythema infectiosum that infects erythrocytes in children [57]. Minute virus of mice infects T lymphocytes of mice and causes very infectious disease especially in laboratory mice [59], [60]. Canine parvovirus is the reason of gastroenteritis which is a fatal disease for dogs [57]. Human bocavirus is a parvovirus that infects humans and causes respiratory infections with mild symptoms, especially in summertime. It was first isolated both in bovine and canine [57].",

After that, with the improvement in the identification methods for viruses such as immunoassays and PCR, they have been described as the most common viral gastroenteritis (community or hospital acquired) agent in children younger than 2 years of age after rotavirus and calicivirus [68], [69], [70]. Astroviruses are transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route, and their infections are not common in adults [69]. Astroviruses-related gastroenteritis causes only mild symptoms, and it can be treated with hydration and electrolyte replacement without further medical treatment [70].",

RT-PCR is the current detection method for the identification of influenza viruses. Influenza virus related influenza symptoms are described as sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, sore throat, myalgia, and nonproductive cough. However, as a common diagnostic mistake, all respiratory illnesses might be considered as flu. For sensitive and accurate diagnosis of influenza, RT-PCR is used. Influenza viruses affect epithelial cells in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and this infection is extremely contiguous due to quick spread potential by coughing and sneezing of infected people. There are two types of available therapeutic antiviral drugs: neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and drugs related with the interference of the function of viral envelope (amantadine and rimantadine). There are also prophylactic live attenuated vaccines such as LAIV4 and FluMist [78], [79].",

Rabies virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are most important rhabdoviruses [83], [84]. Even though VSV, which is the causing agent of vesicular stomatitis, a zoonotic disease, is not considered an important pathogen for humans, it has gained significance due to its newly discovered oncolytic activity and possible use for cancer therapy [84]. Rabies virus was first studied by Louis Pasteur in 1885 even before the detailed studies on viruses have started and he developed a postexposure vaccine [85]. Rabies virus is the only significant human pathogen of rhabdoviruses [83], [85]. It infects the central nervous system of humans and animals and causes fatal disease, rabies, leading to fatal encephalomyelitis [83]. At the onset of the rabies the symptoms are mild and flu-like, but in the later phases of disease, symptoms get more severe such as paralysis, anxiety, insomnia, and hydrophobia; at this stage the recovery is almost impossible [83]. There are currently available postexposure vaccines for humans, domestic, and wildlife animals [84].",

YFV causes hemorrhagic fever with accompanying symptoms, such as vomiting, back pain, and photophobia, and patients to look yellow [89], [90], [91]. DENV is classified into four types, and the transmission of all these to humans takes place through mosquitoes [90]. DENV infection results with hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [90]. With early diagnosis and accurate treatment, fatality rate can be decreased [90]. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is also transmitted to humans through mosquitoes, such as YFV and DENV, and it is the main cause of encephalitis in Asia [89], [90]. Vaccines against JEV are available in Asia and Australia [90]. HCV, which causes acute/chronic hepatitis and liver cancer resulting immunosuppression, was first discovered in 1989 [89]. Ribavirin, sofosbuvir, alpha interferon, and boceprevir are the currently used antiviral drugs for HCV; nonetheless, there is no available preventive vaccine [89]. Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947, but the first ZIKV outbreak took place in 2007. After that, by the end of 2016, ZIKV cases have started to spread rapidly and WHO declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern. General symptoms of ZIKV infections are vomiting, edema, myalgia, headache, and fever. Researches on the development of vaccines against ZIKV are still an ongoing process [90].",
