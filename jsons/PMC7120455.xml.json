Additionally, when using an ultrasonic scaling instrument, aerosols have been found to remain in the air for up to 30 min after the procedure [7]. Aerosols produced during dental procedures have the potential to transmit infectious diseases that can be transmitted by an airborne route. Numerous infections have been documented as being transmitted by an airborne route, the most common being the apparent transmission of cold and influenza viruses. There is evidence in the medical literature of the airborne spread of measles, tuberculosis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8]. Therefore, aerosols generated in the dental treatment area create an additional potential risk for disease transmission to the immunocompromised patient and dental personnel [6, 7]. Reduction of the transmission of infections from aerosols and subsequent contaminated environmental surfaces in all health-care settings, including the dental treatment areas, is best accomplished by incorporating recommended infection control guidelines and standards into the routine practice of dentistry [1, 9].",

Standard Precautions guidelines are based on risk assessment and should be the foundation of infection control standards for all patient care [10]. They are designed to protect health-care personnel from infection and prevent cross-infection among patients from pathogens that can be spread by blood and any other body fluid [1].

Because of this high degree of compliance, the rate of disease transmission in the dental office in the past three decades has been very low, but not inconsequential [1]. In 2007, a case of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis B virus infection associated with an oral surgery procedure was reported. Although the cause of infection could not be conclusively identified, this transmission was most likely linked to a contaminated surface and/or device [20, 21]. In 2014, a case of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis C virus was reported, again associated with oral surgery. While the exact mechanism, in this case, was not identified, contaminated surfaces may have played a role in the transmission [22]. In recent times, the increasing importance of contaminated surfaces that contribute to the spread of infectious diseases and the emergence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance raises the importance of adherence to Standard Precautions. Among the most important lapses of fundamental infection control principles are the failure to perform hand hygiene and adequately disinfect environmental surfaces/devices [23]. Performing disinfection of environmental surfaces in the dental setting is an essential component of infection control guidelines as established by the CDC [1].",

            "text": "The purpose of surface barriers is to prevent contamination of the surface or equipment and reduce the need to clean and disinfect that surface or equipment before reuse [5]. Barrier protection is the most efficient way to protect difficult-to-clean, electronic, and smaller surfaces. Surface barriers should be used on as many surfaces as possible, particularly on surfaces that are difficult to disinfect or access, and surfaces that are touched frequently by gloved hands during patient care and likely to become contaminated [1]. A variety of barrier materials are available, such as clear plastic wrap, bags, sheets, tubing, and plastic-backed paper. Any barrier material chosen to be used on clinical contact surfaces must be impervious to both moisture and fluid. Once properly affixed to the clinical contact surface, barriers are very effective in preventing both direct and indirect contamination [1]. Any barrier is considered a single-use disposable device and must be discarded after every patient encounter and replaced with a new barrier at the end of each patient contact. Figures 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 depict surfaces commonly protected by surface barriers in a dental treatment area. Barriers should never be used for more than one patient [1, 16, 17]. No surface disinfection is necessary if the barrier has remained intact throughout the entire procedure [1, 16, 17]. However, if a barrier has been breached (ripped, torn, fallen off) or the covered surface has evidence of contamination upon barrier removal, that surface needs to be cleaned and disinfected [1, 16, 17]. Barriers should be removed and discarded while the health-care personnel is still wearing gloves. After ungloving and performing hand hygiene, the health-care personnel must cover these surfaces with clean barriers before the next patient encounter [25]. At the end of each day, every clinical contact surface, regardless if barriers are used, should be cleaned and then disinfected with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital disinfectant [1, 16, 17].\n\n\n\n",

In 1991, the CDC proposed an additional category to Spaulding\u2019s classification system designated as \u201cenvironmental surfaces\u201d, which further subdivided environmental surfaces into housekeeping surfaces and medical equipment surfaces [27]. Medical equipment surfaces are referred to in this text as clinical contact surfaces. Environmental surfaces are designated as noncritical because these surfaces generally do not come into direct contact with a patient or contact intact skin, and therefore carry the least risk of disease transmission [1].

Tuberculosis is a very difficult organism to kill; only bacterial spores are more difficult to inactivate than Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Any chemical germicide with a tuberculocidal claim (Intermediate-level disinfectant) is considered capable of inactivating a broad spectrum of microorganisms of most concern in the dental setting, including less-resistant organisms such as blood-borne pathogens (e.g., hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV). More importantly, nonenveloped viruses such as coxsackievirus and rhinovirus (the cause of many upper respiratory infections), human papillomavirus (HPV, the cause of cervical and oropharyngeal cancer), and multiple species of fungi are inactivated by an intermediate-level disinfectant, but these organisms are not inactivated by low-level disinfectants [1, 15, 16].",

The essential components for effective surface disinfection are the selection of the appropriate product for the intended purpose and correct application of the product while adhering to the manufacturer\u2019s label instructions [35]. The product selected for surface disinfection should be effective against the most common causes of health-care-associated infections (HAIs). Check the disinfectant label to verify the product is EPA-registered as effective against the microorganisms that are most commonly linked to HAIs. The contact time (or kill time) for a chemical disinfectant is the length of time it must remain in contact with a microorganism to achieve complete inactivation. A short contact time, of approximately 1\u20132 min, is desirable to ensure the product has killed the microorganisms before the disinfectant dries on the surface, and before staff or patient retouch the treated surface. A surface must remain wet for the length of the required contact time. If a product dries too quickly, it will not achieve the required contact time to kill the microorganisms [35].\n",
