Recent analyses of the structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein revealed the key role of the ACE2 and FURIN genes in facilitating the high-affinity binding of viral particles and their entry into human cells (Walls et al., 2020) . The efficient invasion of host cells by the SARS-CoV-2 is further enhanced by the presence of the unexpected furin cleavage site, which is cleaved during the biosynthesis (Walls et al., 2020) . This novel feature distinguishes the previously known SARS-CoV and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 viruses and possibly contributes to the expansion of the cellular tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 (Walls et al., 2020) . Collectively, these observations identified protein products of the human genes ACE2 and FURIN as the highaffinity receptor (ACE2) and invasion-promoting protease (FURIN) acting as the principal mediators of the SARS-CoV-2 invasion into human cells.",

Any modifications or new elements of statistical analyses are described in the corresponding sections of the Results. Statistical significance of the Pearson correlation coefficients was determined using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 software. Both nominal and Bonferroni adjusted p values were estimated. The statistical significance between the mean values was estimated using the Student T-test. The significance of the differences in the numbers of events between the groups was calculated using two-sided Fisher's exact and",

In addition to the human lung tagged by the ACE2 expression in the ACRHS4 Human Tissues database search, other noteworthy significantly enriched records are the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), Natural Killer Cells and Macrophages tagged by the FURIN expression (Supplemental Figure S1). GSEA of the virus perturbations' data sets among Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) records of up-regulated genes identified the SARS-CoV challenge at 96 hrs (GSE47960) as the most significantly enriched record (Supplemental Figure S2) tagged by expression of both ACE2 and FURIN in human airway epithelial cells. These observations suggest that coronavirus infection triggers the increased expression of both ACE2 and FURIN genes 4 days after the initial encounter with host cells (Figure 1; Supplemental Figure S2). These findings were corroborated by the increased FURIN expression documented in the PBMC of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Figure 1; Supplemental Figure S1; Reghunathan et al., 2005). It would be of interest to investigate whether this potentially infection-promoting effect on expression of the host genes in virus-targeted cells is mediated by the virus-induced release of the biologically-active molecules with the paracrine mode of actions such as interleukins and cytokines. GSEA identified numerous significantly enriched records of common human disorders manifesting up-regulation of either ACE or FURIN genes (Supplemental Figure S3), which is consistent with the clinical observations that individuals with underlying health conditions are more likely to have clinically severe and lethal coronavirus infection. Similarly, exploration of the DisGeNET database of human disorders highlighted multiple disease states' records manifesting altered expression of either ACE2 of FURIN genes (SupplementalFigure S3).Cigarette smoking appears to significantly increase the ACE2 expression in human large airway epithelial cells (SupplementalFigure S3), indicating that cigarette smoking should be considered as a potential coronavirus infection-promoting agent.",

Increased FURIN expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Gene Ontology (GO) analyses revealed that ACE2 and FURIN genes are associated with the largely non-overlapping records of GO Biological Processes, GO Molecular Functions, and GO Cellular Components (Supplemental Figure S4). The common significantly enriched records are Viral Life Cycle (GO Biological Process 2018); Peptidase activity (acting on L-amino acid peptides) and Endopeptidase activity (GO Molecular Function 2018); Membrane raft (GO Cellular Component 2018); Meprin A complex and Retrotrasposon nucleocapsid (Jensen Compartments). Identifications of the enriched records of transcription factor-binding sites affecting the ACE2 and FURIN expression GSEA of the enriched records of transcription factors' binding sites (TFBS) using ENCODE TF ChIP-seq 2015 and ChEA 2016 databases revealed predominantly distinct patterns of TFBS associated with the ACE2 and FURIN genes (Supplemental Figure S5). Common TFBS shared by both ACE2 and FURIN genes are FOS, JUND, EP300 (ENCODE TF ChIP-seq 2015) and GATA1, GATA2, RUNX1, FOXA1, HNF4A (ChIP-seq 2015). Consistent with these findings, non-overlapping profiles of significantly enriched records associated with either ACE2 or FURIN genes were observed of pathways (BioPlanet 2019 database), proteinprotein interactions (PPI) hub proteins (PPI Hub Proteins database), and drugs affecting ACE2 and FURIN expression (Drug Signatures Database, DSigDB), indicating that regulatory mechanisms governing the expression and activities of the ACE2 and FURIN genes are predominantly discordant (Supplemental Figure S5). Next, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was interrogated to gauge the effects on ACE2 and FURIN expression of transcription factors having TFBS associated with their promoters. There are multiple relevant GEO records reporting the activation effects of the JNK1/c-FOS pathway on ACE2 and FURIN expression as well as the activation effects of FURIN depletion on expression of the Fos, Jun, Jund, and Junb genes (SupplementalFigure S5). Conversely, c-Jun inhibition (effect of the dominant negative c-Jun) or c-Jun depletion (c-Jun knockout) has resulted in decreased expression of the FURIN gene (SupplementalFigure S5). The summary of these observations is reported in theFigure 2.Similarly, there are several reports indicating that depletion of either Hnf4a or Runx1 in mouse cells and RUNX1 in human cells decreases the ACE2 and FURIN expression (SupplementalFigure S6). Conversely, FURIN depletion enhances expression of the Runx1 andFoxa1 genes in murine T cells (Supplemental Figure S6). In contrast, FURIN depletion decreases expression of the Hnf4a gene, while Hnf4a depletion decreases the FURIN gene expression (Supplemental Figure S6). The summary of these observations is reported in the Identification of the VDR and HIF1a genes as putative repressors of the ACE2 expression Next GSEA of genomic databases were performed to identify the potential activators and repressors of the ACE2 and FURIN genes. Analysis of the ARCHS4 transcription factors' coexpression database identified the VDR genes that co-expressed with both ACE2 and FURIN genes in human tissues (Supplemental Figure S7). Other significantly enriched records manifest non-overlapping patterns of co-expression with either ACE2 of FURIN genes. The GTEX expression profile of the VDR gene in human tissues revealed the ubiquitous pattern of expression and placed the VDR expression in human lungs in the top quartile (Supplemental Figure S7). Analysis of gene expression profiling experiments of wild type and vitamin D receptor (Vdr) knockout primary bone marrow-derived macrophages reported by Helming et al. (2005) demonstrate increased expression of the ACE2 gene in the VDR knockout cells (SupplementalFigure S7) implicating the product of the VDR gene as the putative repressor of the ACE2 expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, Vitamin D appears to inhibit the ACE2 expression in human bronchial smooth muscle cells (SupplementalFigure S7).",

Notably, examinations of direct and reciprocal effects of the VDR gene and Vitamin D administration on expression of the JNK1/c-FOS pathway genes revealed the expression profiles consistent with the potential therapeutic utility of the Vitamin D administration and activation of the VDR gene expression (Supplemental Figure S7). Analyses of direct and reciprocal effects of the VDR gene and Vitamin D administration on the HNF4a expression revealed that HNF4a depletion in human and murine cells inhibits the VDR gene expression, while the Vdr gene depletion increases the Hnf4a expression (Supplemental Figure S7). These result are consistent with the hypothesis stating that Vitamin D administration and activation of the VDR gene expression may have mitigating effects on the coronavirus infection.

GSEA of the Drug Perturbations from GEO database focused on up-regulated genes indicated that doxorubicin, imatinib, and bleomycin may act as potential coronavirus infection-promoting agents (data not shown). Collectively, these observations provide the initial evidence supporting the hypothesis that both Estradiol and Quercetin may function as potential candidate coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Consistent with this hypothesis, interrogation of the GEO records revealed that Quercetin appears to inhibit expression of several potential coronavirus infection-promoting genes: c-FOS expression in human and rat cells (Supplemental Figure S9); Runx1 expression in rat cells (Supplemental Figure S9); HNF4a expression in human cells (Supplemental",

These observations indicate that any definitive conclusions regarding the potential clinical utility of identified herein potential coronavirus infection mitigating agents should be made only after appropriately designed and carefully executed preclinical studies and randomized clinical trials. In contrast to the Estradiol, which exhibit evidence of both putative coronavirus infection-mitigating actions and coronavirus infection-promoting activities, administration of Testosterone appears to manifest more clearly-defined patterns of altered gene expression consistent with Testosterone being identified as the potential coronavirus infection-promoting agent (Supplemental Figure S11). Potential mechanisms affecting gene expression inferred from transgenic mouse models and observed in pathophysiologically and therapeutically relevant mouse and human cells. Taken into considerations that the effects of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents often manifest cell type-specific patterns of gene expression changes, next the manual curation of the GEO gene expression profiles were carried out to identify the relevant host genetic targets and putative mitigation agents. These analyses identified several candidate repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTC; HIF1a) and activators (INSIG1; HMGA2) of the ACE2 and FURIN expression (Supplemental Figure S12). Notably, the effects on gene expression of the administration of either Vitamin D or Quercetin appear consistent with their definition as putative coronavirus infection mitigation agents (Supplemental Figure S12). The summary of these observations is presented in the Figure 4. The conclusion regarding the findings of cell typespecific effects on gene expression of putative coronavirus infection mitigating agents remains valid and examples of the potential negative effects of drugs on the ACE2 expression are reported in the Supplemental",
