In the intervening years, a great deal has been learned about the structures and mechanisms of viral membrane fusion proteins as well as about the endosomes in which different enveloped viruses fuse and the endosomal cues that trigger fusion. We now recognize three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins based on structural criteria and four mechanisms of fusion triggering. After reviewing general features of viral membrane fusion proteins and viral fusion in endosomes, we delve into three characterized mechanisms for viral fusion triggering in endosomes: by low pH, by receptor binding plus low pH and by receptor binding plus the action of a protease. We end with a discussion of viruses that may employ novel endosomal fusion-triggering mechanisms. A key take-home message is that enveloped viruses that enter cells by fusing in endosomes traverse the endocytic pathway until they reach an endosome that has all of the environmental conditions (pH, proteases, ions, intracellular receptors and lipid composition) to (if needed) prime and (in all cases) trigger the fusion protein and to support membrane fusion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "All enveloped viruses deliver their genomes into the cytoplasm of their host cell by fusing with a cellular membrane.

For class I fusion proteins the cleavage occurs in the fusion protein (precursor), whereas for class II fusion proteins, it occurs in a companion protein (Table 3) . Depending on the viral fusion protein and the cells infected, priming can occur in the Golgi, at a cell surface or in an endosome. For example, for most strains of influenza virus, cleavage of the HA precursor (HA0) occurs in the extracellular space or at the cell surface by trypsin-like proteases, but highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 are cleaved in the Golgi by furin-like proteases based on the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (73) . Proteolytic priming separates HA0 into a receptor binding (HA1) and a fusion (HA2) subunit. Consequently, the fusion peptide is found at the amino terminus of HA2. Aspects of HA priming, for example accessibility of the cleavage site within HA0 (including obstruction by carbohydrates) as well as the host cells and tissues where priming occurs and the proteases involved, are thought to be critical determinants of influenza pathogenesis (43, 74, 75) .

The prehairpin then folds back causing the N-and C-\u03b1-helical heptad repeats to form a six-helix bundle (6HB) and progressively pulling the target (pink) and viral (light blue) membranes through stages of close apposition (iv), hemifusion (v) and fusion pore formation (vi). In some cases (e.g. for influenza HA), membrane coalescence is aided by further packing of sequences C-terminal to the C-heptad in the grooves of the central N-heptad coiled coil (72) . Importantly, for all characterized viral fusion proteins, the final (postfusion) conformation (vi) is a trimer-of-hairpins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 218, "text": "(67)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1020, "text": "(72)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 2: Model for how viral fusion proteins function."}, {"text": "The diagram in Figure 2 is for a class I viral fusion protein (Table 3 ) such as the influenza HA (96, 97) .

Some neutral pH fusing viruses (most retroviruses) possess a single glycoprotein (Env) whereas others (e.g. herpesviruses) have more. Retroviral Envs are class I fusion proteins. Binding of the receptor(s), to the receptor-binding subunit of Env, unclamps the fusion subunit, which then proceeds through conformational changes that mediate fusion (Figure 2 ). An interesting case is Env from murine leukemia virus (MLV), a \u03b3-retrovirus. MLV Env contains a thiol exchange motif (CXXC) in its receptor-binding subunit. Engagement of the host cell surface receptor activates this motif, which then isomerizes a disulfide bond between the CXXC motif and a CX 6 CC motif in the fusion subunit. By breaking this critical disulfide bond, the fusion subunit is unclamped and executes the fusion cascade (180) . A similar isomerization occurs in Env of human T-cell leukemia virus, a \u03b4-retrovirus (181) . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a lentivirus within the retrovirus family, presents a different case. The two subunits of HIV Env are not disulfide-bonded and HIV Env does not contain a thiol exchange motif. For most HIV strains Env engagement with its primary receptor (CD4) elicits a change in its receptor-binding subunit that reveals a binding site for a co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5).

While a recent study detected cell-cell fusion mediated by 19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2 at neutral pH, the fusion pores formed were small and non-expanding (242), likely not large enough to pass a viral nucleocapsid. Moreover, the latter findings (242) are difficult to reconcile with the observations that 19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2-mediated entry and infection are potently inhibited by both bafilomycin and E64d (77, 230, 238) , and that only small structural changes were observed in the 19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2 ectodomain bound to the NPC1 C-loop and crystallized at pH 5.0 (243) . Collectively, these findings suggest that in addition to NPC1 and low pH, another factor(s) is needed to mediate EBOV fusion in a manner that will lead to productive infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 288, "end": 293, "text": "(117,", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 294, "end": 298, "text": "121)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 389, "end": 394, "text": "(239)", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 395, "end": 400, "text": "(240)", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}, {"start": 401, "end": 406, "text": "(241)", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 514, "end": 519, "text": "(236)", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 759, "end": 764, "text": "(242)", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}, {"start": 919, "end": 923, "text": "(77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 924, "end": 928, "text": "230,", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 929, "end": 933, "text": "238)", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1083, "text": "(243)", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cases for Which the Triggering Mechanism Is Not Yet Clear"}, {"text": "The sensitivity of 19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2-mediated fusion and entry to E64d (77, 229, 230, 233, 238) suggests that further action of a cysteine protease may be required. However, neither the factor(s) responsible for the E64 sensitivity nor its target (19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2 or a host constituent) has yet been identified. The roles of other potential triggering factors also remain unclear. Interestingly, the fusion subunits of EBOV GP and ASLV Env share structural and functional similarities (152, 196) . Both contain a CX6CC motif, but neither of their receptor-binding subunits contains a thiol exchange motif (CXXC), as seen in the MLV and HTLV Envs, which use disulfide bond isomerization for fusion (see above). Hence, an analogous fusion-triggering mechanism for EBOV GP would require exogenous reducing activity. While disulfide reducing agents (at low pH) can induce the 19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2 ectodomain to bind to target membranes (236) , there is no evidence for a physiological role for disulfide bond reduction for EBOV entry. Even the role of NPC1 is still unclear. As for LAMP1 in LASV entry, does NPC1 play an active role in fusion triggering (i.e. induce significant conformational changes in 19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2 at physiological temperature) or is a main role, for example, to direct fusion to the limiting membrane of the endolysosome (i.e. away from the numerous small vesicles found within endolysosomes)? The role of TPC2 also remains to be elucidated (230, 232) . Hence, triggering of primed 19 kDa-GP1-S-S-GP2 to form a productive fusion pore is complex, and it may represent a novel mode of fusion triggering.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 72, "end": 76, "text": "(77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 77, "end": 81, "text": "229,", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 82, "end": 86, "text": "230,", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 87, "end": 91, "text": "233,", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 92, "end": 96, "text": "238)", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 489, "end": 494, "text": "(152,", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 495, "end": 499, "text": "196)", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 934, "end": 939, "text": "(236)", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1471, "text": "(230,", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1476, "text": "232)", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cases for Which the Triggering Mechanism Is Not Yet Clear"}, {"text": "HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae (Hepacivirus genus).

Many questions remain. For examples: Are there additional classes of enveloped viral fusion proteins? Are there additional fusion-triggering mechanisms? What are the common principles by which proteases trigger fusion proteins post receptor binding? How is fusion triggering orchestrated in multicomponent fusion machines? In another vein, recent work suggests that enveloped virus-membrane fusion can spark signaling responses that trigger innate immune responses (266, 267) , and that cells can use interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins to block virus-cell fusion (268) . For their part, some viruses, notably HIV, have evolved means to counter attempts by cells to thwart virus-cell fusion (269, 270) . How exactly are these battles between enveloped viruses and cells enacted?
