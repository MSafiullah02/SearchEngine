Prior to COVID-19, medical error was seen as a global priority that prompted the first \u201cWorld Patient Safety Day\u201d by the WHO on September 17th, 2019. The intention is to make healthcare safer, to raise global awareness of patient safety, and, to encourage people to show their commitment (to \u201cspeak up for patient safety\u201d).",

Training exercises, in a military context, reduce the risk of \u2018skill fade\u2019; candidates on the LIVEX (live training during an exercise period) pilot in 2015 found it a suitable means to ensure operational preparedness was maintained.8 This is particularly pertinent in the military medical setting when a HOSPEX (hospital exercise simulation) is employed (Fig. 2\na and b).9 This can be adapted to a particular threat, such as the Ebola crisis seen in Op GRITROCK, and, many of the lessons are relevant to COVID-19.10\n",

Consequently, to enable effective systems-based medical training, a challenge culture of assertive followership is a vital element, not only to enhance learning but to reduce medical error.
