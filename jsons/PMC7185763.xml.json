            "text": "Influenza infection is a major cause of severe morbidity and mortality. Understanding the interplay between the influenza virus and its host cells is critical for the development of successful therapeutic approaches. In numerous studies, the host response to influenza infection has been characterized by measuring bulk cell populations and their further experimental validation. Collectively, these have provided rough models of the host response (e.g., Altboum et al., 2014, Shapira et al., 2009), but it is clear that the in situ infected lung is far more complex than the current models. For example, while epithelial cells are known to be the main targets of the influenza virus, several studies have documented that other cell types, such as endothelial cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), are also susceptible to the influenza virus, with potential implications of intracellular infection for their functionality (Manicassamy et al., 2010, McFadden et al., 2009). Complexity may also be related to a wide range of viral transcriptional states within the infected cells (Russell et al., 2018, Xin et al., 2018, Zanini et al., 2018), as well as to the heterogeneity of host-response states (Avraham et al., 2015). Another complication may be attributable to the dual role of the metabolic machinery in supporting the host while also limiting the energetic demands of the viral life cycle (Jovanovic et al., 2015, Kissig et al., 2017). Yet another source of heterogeneity may derive from the possibility that only a subset of the cells are actually infected by influenza, while most of the cells in the population are bystanders (exposed but uninfected) and typically respond to defensive host signals such as type I interferons (IFNs) (McFadden et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Multiple key questions related to the complexity of the in vivo influenza infection have yet to be answered. In particular, the extent and nature of intracellular infection in different cell types has not been systematically elucidated. Furthermore, systematic characterization of host-response heterogeneity in bystander and infected cells across various cell types remains uncharacterized. Advances in the fluorescent labeling of influenza viruses have opened the way to an unbiased separation of infected and bystander cells (De Baets et al., 2015, Manicassamy et al., 2010). A potential source of limitation with this technique is that reporter proteins cannot be expressed in the influenza virus without changing its infectivity, probably because of the significant burden of the reporter on viral fitness (Breen et al., 2016). As a result, it has been a challenging task to characterize in vivo the full repertoire of viral-host interactions using these strains. An opportunity to tackle this challenge was provided by recent advances in single-cell genomic technologies (Jaitin et al., 2014, Paul et al., 2015), allowing for simultaneous mapping of both the host and the viral transcriptome in the same single cell.",

            "text": "Here, we report the first comprehensive single-cell mRNA profiling of influenza-treated lungs. We characterized the host and the viral transcriptomes for 7,325 single cells from nine immune and non-immune cell types in both wild-type and Irf7-knockout (KO) mice. We found that substantial proportions (22%\u201362%) of all cell types are infected by the influenza virus, and showed that infected cells predominantly have low intracellular viral transcriptome loads. Exceptional in this respect are epithelial cells, which are infected with massive viral loads (reaching up to 20% of all transcripts). Using Irf7-KO mice, which are incapable of launching an effective type I IFN response, we found that infectivity is a basic cellular property that is independent of the type I IFN host response. Moreover, our analysis highlights a core module of type I IFN genes (\u201cIFN module\u201d) that is shared by nearly all cell types. By comparing infected and bystander cells in both wild-type and Irf7-KO mice, we showed that this module is predominantly affected by Irf7-dependent bystander exposure, consistently with the established IFN feedback loop. Another notable finding was that influenza infection also leads to a generic repression of mitochondrially encoded genes and that this response is largely uncoupled from induction of the IFN module: unlike the IFN module, the mitochondrial module responds to both Irf7-dependent and Irf7-independent signals and manifests its peak of repression only after intracellular viral invasion.",

We first used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate immune (CD45+) and non-immune (CD45\u2212) cells derived from the lungs of influenza-treated and PBS (\u201ccontrol\u201d)-treated mice. Next, we used a massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq approach (MARS-seq; Jaitin et al., 2014) that profiles all polyadenylated mRNAs (STAR Methods, Figure 1\nA). A total of 2,034 and 2,146 cells were analyzed from influenza-treated and control mice, respectively. To evaluate the quality of the data, we identified genes that are differentially expressed in cells isolated from the influenza-treated mice compared with the control (binomial test, STAR Methods). As expected, these genes (P\nbinomial <10\u22125) were overrepresented in antiviral-related signaling pathways, such as IFN signaling (P\nhg <10\u22128) and Irf7 signaling (P\nhg <10\u22127).",

We did this by first excluding genes that correlated strongly with the top two principal components (top 1.5% of principal-component-correlated genes), which were strongly enriched for antiviral, anti-proliferative, and inflammatory processes (Figure S1A). Next, we applied the expectation maximization clustering algorithm as previously described (Paul et al., 2015), and manually annotated each cluster based on the expression of canonical markers. The analysis produced nine robust clusters with a total of 4,064 cells, which comprised four clusters of non-immune cell types: epithelial cells (EP), lymphatic and blood endothelial cells (LEC and BEC, respectively), and fibroblasts (FIB), and five specialized immune cell types: granulocytes (GN), T cells, B cells, NK cells, and a joint cluster of dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages collectively termed the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) (Figure 1B, Table S1, STAR Methods). To determine whether cells were indeed clustered by cell type rather than by treatment or by intracellular viral gene transcription, each individual cell was annotated according to its best match with the global expression of previously sorted bulk cell subsets. As shown in Figures S1B and S1C, the annotation of individual cells based on the bulk transcriptome data was in agreement with the marker-based annotation of these clusters. We further used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to project the different cell subpopulations onto a 2-dimensional space. As expected, cells annotated with the same cell type formed a separate t-SNE cluster independently of treatment (influenza-treated versus control) (Figures 1C and 1D).",

We inferred the viral load within a cell from the amount of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that are aligned with viral segments. Specifically, the viral load was defined as the proportion of viral UMIs (that is, UMIs aligned with one of the viral segments) in the total UMI content of a given cell. Accordingly, we defined three groups of cells: (1) \u201cinfected cells,\u201d cells whose viral load is higher than a certain selected viral-load cutoff; (2) \u201cbystanders,\u201d cells that are derived from the influenza-treated mouse but do not detectably express any vmRNA (viral load is zero); and (3) \u201cunexposed cells,\u201d cells derived from a control mouse that was never infected (Figure 1A). Utilizing a model that takes cross-contamination and various technical artifacts into account, we showed that infected cells can be recovered with high precision over a range of viral-load cutoffs (Supplemental Information and Figures S2A\u2013S2C). For example, among the inferred infected granulocytes we correctly predicted 99% by using a strict viral-load cutoff of 1%, and 88% by using a more permissive (0.01%) cutoff. Utilizing a reporter model of in vitro infection (Shnayder et al., 2018), we were able to assess how well vmRNA detection recapitulates the actual infected cells (see details in Supplemental Information). We observed that our cell grouping correctly predicts a high fraction of bona fide infected cells (Figure S2D): using viral-load cutoffs of 0.05%, we correctly recovered 79% of the infected cells. Infected cells that were not identified were those with low viral loads that lead to dropout events; it should, however, be possible to identify many of those cells by increasing the RNA-seq coverage.",

Based on this cutoff, we calculated for each cell type the percentage of infected cells among the cells derived from the influenza-treated mouse.

First, we confirmed the high prevalence of infected cells using flow cytometry of immune cell subsets that were stained for the intracellular viral nucleoprotein (NP) (STAR Methods). In agreement with our predictions, we found a high prevalence of NP-positive cells within the infected lung tissue, with observed percentages of 48%, 43%, 55%, 61%, and 43% NP-positive cells in Cd45+, Cd45+Ly6g+, Cd45+Cd11b+, Cd45+Ly6g\u2212Cd11b\u2212, and Cd45\u2212 cells, respectively (using false detection rate <5%; Figures S3A and S3B). In comparison, only 2% of NP-positive cells were observed when cells were stained for extracellular NP (Figure S3B, STAR Methods), indicating that the observed high prevalence of infected (NP-positive) cells could not be attributed to free NP proteins or NP-RNA complexes. Second, we observe a low amount of background noise: only 25 of 2,075 unexposed cells (1.2%) were erroneously classified as infected cells (Figure 2A and Table S1). Third, an authentic influenza replication involves the generation of spliced isoforms for vmRNAs derived from specific segments. Indeed, we could detect the typical spliced form of the vmRNA derived from Segment 7 in cDNA libraries of Cd45+ cells (Figure S3C, STAR Methods), strengthening the notion that viral replication is not limited to epithelial cells but can also occur in immune cells. Fourth, UMIs were specifically aligned to the 3\u2032 end of the polyadenylated viral RNA (Figure S1D) and cells were found to simultaneously express different viral genes (Figure S1E), confirming that the results were not attributable to non-specific predictions. Fifth, detection of vmRNA could, in principle, be confounded by the quality and complexity of cells. In that case, the infected and bystander cell populations should differ in their cell qualities. Such a difference is implausible, however, because the quality metrics of infected cells resemble those seen in bystanders (Figures S3D and S3E), with the single notable exception of cell size, which, in agreement with earlier studies (Xin et al., 2018), is higher in the infected cells (Supplemental Information and Figures S3D\u2013S3G).",

To address this question we performed a second biological replicate of an influenza-treated animal (using the same pipeline as in Figure 1A). This biological replicate consisted of the same cell-type populations, with totals of 833 bystanders and 402 infected cells (Table S1). Importantly, cell-type-specific percentages of infected cells were found to be highly reproducible in the two biological replicates (Spearman correlation = 0.93; Figure 2B), although there were differences in absolute fractions between experiments. In particular, T cells were associated with the lowest infection, while the highest percentage of infected cells was observed in epithelial cells. Among the rest, non-immune cells were generally associated with higher infection rates than those of immune cells. Notably, these results were reproducible in replicate mice examined 72 hr after infection (Spearman correlation = 0.83; Figure S4A) and were consistent with previous reports (Figure S4B). Since all of the single-cell experimental and computational procedures were applied on each mouse independently, our results suggested that the observed differences in fractions of infected cells between cell types reflect a true cell-type-specific property.",

However, current studies have typically used bulk-tissue data or focused on one or a few cell types (Altboum et al., 2014, Mostafavi et al., 2016). Those studies were therefore limited in their ability to identify the \u201cgeneric\u201d influenza response that is presumably essential in all immune- and non-immune cell types. To characterize this response systematically, we calculated the differential expression between cell populations of the influenza-treated and control tissues for each of the nine cell types separately. We found a total of 450 genes to be differentially expressed (P\nbinomial <10\u22126) in at least one cell type (Figure 3\nA, Table S4; STAR Methods). Clustering of these genes revealed a large generic module of 101 genes that showed consistent upregulation during influenza infection in nearly all immune- and non-immune cell types (Figure 3A, e.g., Irf7 and B2m in Figure 3B). As shown in Figure S5A, comparison of expression levels in the influenza-treated and control mice revealed that the module was indeed expressed at higher levels during infection in all genes and cell types. As an additional support, the module was validated in an independent biological replicate experiment (Figure S5B). Notably, the majority of genes in this module represented known IFN-stimulated genes (e.g., P\nhg <10\u221239 and P\nhg <10\u221251 for the \u201cIFN\u03b21\u201d and \u201cIFNR\u201d signaling categories, respectively) and targets of various antiviral transcription factors such as Irf7 and Stat1 (P\nhg <10\u221241 and P\nhg <10\u221246, respectively), indicating that the module is part of a general type I IFN response that is independent of the cell type.

The trajectory revealed strong co-regulation in all cell types: genes of the IFN module were either co-expressed or anti-correlated through the trajectory (Figure 3C), as if the trajectory manifests a gradual progression of cells from a homeostatic to an antiviral state. Consistently with this notion, the influenza-treated cells were more strongly biased than the unexposed cells toward the high antiviral range (p < 10\u221213 in all cell types; Figure S5C). To validate the antiviral trajectory, we used the single-cell RNA-seq data from influenza-treated Irf7-KO mice. We hypothesized that in the absence of Irf7, the cells would exhibit an impaired trajectory of the antiviral response. We found that cells from the Irf7-KO sample indeed showed a clear bias toward the high antiviral range, but did not develop to their full antiviral potential (Figure S5C). This showed that the trajectory indeed represents a snapshot of the cells' progression through the antiviral response. We note that the plasticity of this antiviral trajectory probably reflects reversible regulatory alterations (unlike irreversible developmental processes), as previously observed in immune cells (Lavin et al., 2014, Okabe and Medzhitov, 2014).",

However, the generality of these findings in different cell types and their relevance for influenza stimulation remained unknown. Interestingly, analysis across the cell types revealed seven mitochondrially encoded genes that were consistently repressed in nearly all cell types (Figures 3A and S5A; the \u201cmitochondrial module\u201d). Two lines of evidence further supported this module. First, we analyzed bulk data from influenza-treated lungs and found substantial repression of the mitochondrial module (Figure S5D). Secondly, the data clearly demonstrated anti-correlation of the IFN and mitochondrial modules through the antiviral cell trajectory (Figure 3D). Taken together, our data suggested that the generic IFN and the mitochondrial modules constitute two arms of the host response that are independent of the particular cell type.",

Interestingly, trajectory-regulated genes of different cell types were enriched with the same underlying regulatory programs (Figures S6C and S6D), although the specific target genes of each regulatory program differed drastically between cell types (e.g., Daxx was regulated in granulocytes and T cells but not in fibroblasts, whereas Gbp6 was regulated in T cells and fibroblasts but not in granulocytes; Figures S6E and S6F).

In particular, differences in expression levels can be affected by extracellular exposure to the infectious lung environment, or may be associated with intracellular viral invasion. Previous studies have characterized many of the signaling cascades that operate in influenza infection, such as IFN and NF-\u03baB signaling (Shapira et al., 2009), but the contribution of each stimulus to the host response was not well understood. We hypothesized that differential expression between the populations of bystanders and unexposed cells would identify transcriptional regulation associated with exposure to extracellular environmental signals, since both cell subsets lack intracellular host-pathogen encounters. Similarly, differential expression between infected and bystander cell populations could identify transcriptional regulation associated with the intracellular virus infection, since both subsets are essentially exposed to the same extracellular signals. For simplicity, we termed bystander/unexposed differential expression as \u201cbystander response\u201d and infected/bystander differential expression as \u201cinfection response\u201d (Figure 4\nA, top; in both cases, a signed log binomial test p value was used).

In agreement, our analysis of the infected Irf7-KO mouse revealed a significant reduction in the bystander response of the IFN module (Figures 4C and 4D, left, and S7A).

Conceptually, this suggested that although the virus is maintained at a relatively low viral load, it is still sensed through Irf7-independent intracellular viral sensors.

A total of 234 genes attained significant differential expression between infected cells and bystanders in one of these cell types (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01, Table S6), suggesting a transcriptional response associated with intracellular viral infection. To validate the identified genes, we carried out an experiment using an independent biological replicate. The results showed that the candidate genes significantly overlap with those identified by the replicate mouse. In granulocytes, for instance, of 47 candidates, 17 (36%) attained significant scores in another mouse (Phg <10\u22127, Figure S8C). Differential expression scores were also strongly correlated between the two replicates (Figure S8D). We therefore focused on the set of 34 validated genes (Figure 5\nA). Examination of the expression pattern along the antiviral trajectory showed that the identified targets consisted primarily of responding genes, with stronger response amplitudes in infected cells than in bystanders (Figures 5A and 5B). In particular, in 24 of the 34 genes (70%), the bystander and infection responses followed the same direction (either enhanced repression or enhanced induction). Thus, intracellular infection was generally associated with an elevated peak of response of cell-type-specific genes, irrespective of the direction of response. This is not unexpected, given that the intracellular viral sensing through Toll-like receptor 3 and RIG-I probably resulted in an enhanced antiviral response.",

Our approach should be therefore applicable to a variety of medically important negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (such as RSV, influenza, Ebola, and measles) and double-stranded DNA viruses (such as herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and poxviruses). Our dual-transcriptome mapping is less effective in reverse transcribing viruses and double-stranded RNA viruses, which have two sources of positive-stranded RNAs (both genome- and transcriptome-derived RNAs); further optimization will be needed to apply our methodology in these cases. Of note, in the special case of positive-sense ssRNA viruses, our approach is not applicable due to the lack of polyadenylated transcriptome (e.g., Zika, dengue, and yellow fever viruses) or the polyadenylated genome (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease virus, rubella, and severe acute respiratory syndrome). Tailored technologies have been developed for this specific case (e.g., Zanini et al., 2018).

Our findings suggested that viral infection in vivo is highly prevalent in many additional cell types (Figure 2A). In agreement with the transcriptome analyses, our flow cytometry assays confirmed that immune cells indeed harbor a large percentage of cells expressing the viral NP during in vivo infection (Figures S3A and S3B). If the high prevalence of infected cells is not due to technical noise, this model would predict that the percentage of infected cells would be a cell-type-specific property. Quantitatively similar fractions of infected cells were indeed observed across the different biological replicates examined (Figures 2B, 2C, S4A, and S4B). The prediction that infected cells would be prevalent in all cell types was consistent with the observation that much of the wide spectrum of antiviral-related cell states was generic and appeared in nearly all cell types (Figures 3 and 4 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Thus, instead of a different antiviral response being tailored to \u201csusceptible\u201d and \u201cresistant\u201d cell types, the host response confers the first line of defense in all key cell types.",

For example, in vitro infection of epithelial cells results in wide heterogeneity of transcriptional viral loads (Russell et al., 2018), and during in vitro infection, low viral loads are prevalent in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells (Brooke et al., 2013). Here, focusing on in vivo infection, we found that epithelial cells indeed display high viral-load heterogeneity, whereas the remaining cell types maintain low viral-load states (Figure 2D). Notably, high vmRNA expression does not necessarily imply high viral progeny, probably owing to failure to express one or more viral segments (Heldt et al., 2015); in fact, up to 90% of cells infected at low multiplicity of infection fail to release infectious progeny (Brooke et al., 2013). Changing intracellular host response and viral loads could affect viral titers and should be further explored (Cristinelli and Ciuffi, 2018). Novel experimental techniques will be needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of virus production levels through joint analysis of host transcriptional responses (Figure 1A) and viral titer assays (Heldt et al., 2015) at single-cell resolution. Revealing such mechanisms will be of great interest, since their modification may lead to more effective therapeutic interventions.",

By analyzing influenza infection over all cell types from the entire lung, we were able to establish the general principles of antiviral induction and mitochondrial suppression across all of the abundant cell types of influenza-treated lungs. The existence of two antagonistic generic programs may be an efficient antiviral strategy: whereas the activation of the type I IFN response provides antiviral defense mechanisms such as biosynthesis and secretion of cytokines, suppression of mitochondrial activity typically limits energetic resources, which, in turn attenuates the efficiency of viral replication and manipulation (Goswami et al., 2013).",

It is therefore likely that the different cell types maintain an appropriate balance between antiviral response and mitochondrial suppression. Our data suggested (1) that the heterogeneity of the generic IFN module typically reaches its main potential in bystander cells (Figure 4), and upon intracellular viral invasion the antiviral program is fine-tuned in a cell-type-specific manner (Figure 5); (2) that the peak of mitochondrial generic suppression typically arises in infected cells, and that in the absence of intracellular viral invasion, bystander cells demonstrate cell-type-specific control of mitochondrially encoded genes (upregulation in epithelial cells and downregulation in the rest of the cell types; Figure 4). Given these observations, it is tempting to speculate that the mechanism of mitochondrial energy balance is addressed by means of temporal uncoupling of the IFN module from the mitochondrial module: bystanders exploit the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d prior to intracellular infection to achieve their shift toward high IFN-response states, while supporting the energetic demands with an adequate amount of energetic resources. Mitochondrial suppression reaches its full capacity only in infected cells, when viral restriction is crucial in a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d mechanism (Zaslaver et al., 2004). Accordingly, after intracellular viral invasion, when energetic resources are limited, substantial adjustment of the host gene expression is limited to specific genes and cell types.",

Such comparison has been difficult because of the need to isolate multiple cell types simultaneously from the same infected organ. This question is particularly relevant because exposure of the epithelial barrier to the invading pathogen probably precedes the exposure of other cell types; thus, the ability of epithelial cells to maintain substantial secretion of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines may be crucial for an efficient and timely host response. The present study shows that epithelial cells are phenotypically distinct: bystander epithelial cells display substantial induction of mitochondrially encoded genes, rather than the observed characteristic partial suppression by the rest of the cell types studied here (Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, our data support a model in which bystander epithelial cells display tailored changes in energetic resources to support the feasibility of their excessive energetic demands. While these observations are consistent with the experiments described here, additional experimentation will be needed to determine whether the mitochondrial transcriptome is decoupled from the cell size during viral infection in vivo.",

Furthermore, infected cells tended to be larger than bystanders (Figure S3G). Determining whether such functional differences exist and whether there might be interrelationships among the various functionalities will require further experimentation.

Their lungs were then perfused with PBS via the right ventricle, and then divided into two groups that were subjected to different dissociation techniques. Half of the entire pool of lungs was dissected and dissociated into single-cell suspensions, using the Miltenyi Lung Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) in combination with a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) and enzymatic dissociation. The other half of the lung pool was minced, suspended in 5mL of digestion buffer consisting of elastase (3 U/mL; Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and DNase I (0.33 U/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM/F12 medium, incubated with frequent agitation at 37\u00b0C for 20 min, and briefly triturated (Treutlein et al., 2014). Whereas the Milteny kit is optimized for most immune cell types, the elastase-based protocol allows for a higher representation of epithelial cells. Next, an equal volume mixture of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (1 U/mL; Biological Industries) was added to the single-cell suspensions in both groups. Following their enzymatic incubations, cells derived from the same lungs (after the two dissociation techniques) were merged and forced through a 100-\u03bcm mesh and then through a 70-\u03bcm mesh into ice-cold FACS buffer (2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Prior to sorting, all samples were stained for DAPI, filtered through a 40-\u03bcm mesh, and stained with F450-conjugated TER-119 and APC-conjugated CD45 antibodies (BioLegend). Cell populations were sorted using SORP-aria (BD Biosciences) and gates were set at standard FSC and SSC levels. Following erythrocyte and doublet exclusion (by application of an FSC-H/SSC-W singlets gate), isolated DAPI-TER-119-CD45+ and DAPI-TER-119-CD45- cells were single-cell-sorted into 384-well cell-capture plates containing 2 \u03bcL of lysis solution and barcoded poly(T) reverse transcription (RT) primers for single-cell RNA-seq (Jaitin et al., 2014, Paul et al., 2015). Four empty wells served as controls in each 384-well plate.

We performed this joint analysis as previously described (Shnayder et al., 2018), with a few modifications. We used HISAT (Kim et al., 2015) to map the single-cell reads to a joint reference of both the mouse genome build mm9 and the influenza genome (NCBI records: NC_002016, NC_002017, NC_002018, NC_002019, NC_002020, NC_002021, NC_002022, NC_002023). To identify authentic intracellular viral replication (rather than free virions), specificity for the positive-sense viral mRNA is imperative; in accordance, we mapped reads to the positive-strand-specific isoforms of the viral genes. Reads that were mapped at multiple (host or viral) positions were omitted. We recorded reads that were mapped to either influenza segments or to exonic regions of mouse genes based on the UCSC transcript annotation. The expression level for each single cell was calculated on the basis of its number of UMIs. To account for spurious mapping, we filtered reads with cell-barcoding errors and UMIs that contained more than one error that might be due to sequencing or amplification errors. Quantification of technical noise associated with the assessment of viral transcripts is described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Poor-quality genes (with <5 recorded UMIs across all cells) were excluded from further analysis. We also filtered poor-quality cells (with < 200 recorded UMIs across all genes; Table S1). Additional cells were filtered at the cell-type annotation stage (see below).",

We did this by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on all cells, and omitting from further analysis genes that correlated with the top two PCs (top 1.5% of PC-correlated genes). In the second step, cells were clustered using the multinomial mixture model clustering algorithm (Paul et al., 2015). The first two steps were performed separately on CD45+ and CD45\u2212 cells. In the third step, each of the resulting cell groups was annotated on the basis of two criteria: (1) by the presence of a set of well-known cell surface markers, as demonstrated in Figure 1B, and (2) by resemblance to profiled bulk populations of cell types from the ImmGen compendium (Heng et al., 2008). For each group, the resemblance was estimated using deconvolution on the group's average profile as the dependent variable and bulk profiles as explanatory variables. In the fourth step, groups were merged into 12 clusters based on their cell-type annotation. The nine largest clusters that appeared in all mice were used for further analysis, and the remaining three small clusters were discarded (Table S1). As an example, we analyzed a total of 2075 cells (from control mice) and 1989 cells (from infected mice, 48 h, replicate I) within these nine clusters (Table S1). The quality of the clustering solution was evaluated according to the homogeneity of each cluster at single-cell resolution. In particular, we tested the similarity between each single cell and a bulk cell-type profile (using Pearson\u2019s correlation; Figure S1B). For visualization purposes, the data were reduced to two dimensions using the t-SNE algorithm (Van Der Maaten and Hinton, 2008), based on the known cell-type markers from Figure 1B.",

The differential expression test makes the null assumption that the two cell populations are derived from the same binomial distribution of gene expression: x\ni \u223c B(n\ni, p\nAB), where x\ni is the number of UMIs of a certain gene in the i-th cell, n\ni is the total UMI count in the i-th cell, and p\nAB is the probability of sampling a UMI associated with that gene in both populations A and B. The alternative hypothesis is that the expression in each cell population is derived from a different binomial distribution: x\ni \u223c B(n\ni, p\nA)and x\ni \u223c B(n\ni, p\nB), respectively, in cells from populations A and B, where p\nA and p\nB are the probabilities of sampling a UMI associated with the relevant gene in the respective cell populations. Accordingly, here we calculated the maximum likelihood of the null and the alternative hypotheses by fitting the binomial parameters p\u02c6A, p\u02c6B and p\u02c6AB to each cell population separately. Finally, a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was applied and a P-value was approximated in accordance with Wilks' theorem using a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. We report the 'differential expression' (DE) either as a P-value or as a signed log10 (LRT P-value), where the sign corresponds to the difference between the maximum likelihood parameters (namely, the success probabilities p\u02c6A and p\u02c6B) of the two cell populations. Note that calculation of the differential expression takes into consideration differences in total UMI counts (n\ni values) among the two populations of cells.

Ordering of cells by their state is referred to as the 'antiviral trajectory'. This trajectory was validated in cells of each cell type separately by demonstrating: (i) enrichment of antiviral-related functionalities in trajectory-correlated genes (Figure S6D); (ii) distinct distributions of Irf7-KO-derived and wild type-derived single cells through the trajectory (Figure S5C); and (iii) co-regulation of genes along the trajectory (Figures 3C and 3D). Transcriptional dynamics is represented as a moving average of expression over the antiviral trajectory, sliding one cell at a time with a window size of one-sixth of the trajectory length (Figures 3D, 5B, S6F, and S7D).",
