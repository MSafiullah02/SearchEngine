First COVID-19 cases were confirmed in individuals who had previously visited this market [1] . Nevertheless, the following COVID-19 cases were not exposed to this kind of seafood market-related infection. Therefore, a potential human to human transmission was suggested to be the main source of the virus spread [1] . The virus is transmitted between individuals through respiratory droplets that are produced by an infected person while sneezing, coughing or talking and staying in the short distance from another person. Direct contact with a person with COVID-19 or a direct contact with the surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 with subsequent contact with own nasal cavity, oral cavity or eyes are also sources of infection [1] . Oro-fecal transmission of the virus is presumably also possible. It was suggested that the two meters distance between an infected and non-infected person should be enough to avoid infection [2] . Van Doremalen et al. conducted an experimental study in which they reported that SARS-CoV-2 was able to remain viable in aerosols for 3 h [3] . SARS-CoV-2 survived up to 72 h on plastic and stainless steel, on copper the virus was not detected after 4 h, while on cardboard no viable virus was found after 24 h [3] .",

Currently, patients with severe lower respiratory tract infection should be considered as potential SARS-CoV-2 carriers [30] . Nevertheless, to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 molecular test must detect SARS-CoV-2 presence [30] . The specific test for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Presently, it is the recommended test to diagnose SARS-Cov-2 infection. A positive RT-PCT test for SARS-CoV-2 confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the vast majority of cases, nevertheless, false-positive results can also occur [30] . RT-PCR is considered as highly specific, however, in a number of cases its sensitivity seemed not to be enough to diagnose the disease. RT-PCR sensitivity range [31] or as high as 97% [32] . Keeping in mind such detection discrepancies, doctors should repeat the test after several days. Molecular examination is performed on specimens obtained mainly from the respiratory tract and sometimes from stool [30] . In severe form of the disease, blood is tested for SARS-CoV-2 presence [30] . Nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal aspirates or sputum could be taken for testing [30] .",

The authors suggested that chest CT could be considered as a sensitive and useful test in detecting COVID-19 in the areas affected by COVID-19 epidemic [32] . CT of the thoracic cavity revealing groundglass opacities, infiltrates and bronchovascular thickening consolidations strongly suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection [23] .
