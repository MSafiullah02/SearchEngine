The association between the disease severity of COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remains unknown.

There were no limitations on language or date of publication. Data were independently reviewed by two investigators. Conflicts were resolved through consensus. The strategies included MeSH and Embase terms as well as keywords including coronavirus, COVID-19, 2019nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, CVD, CVD events, diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), smoking, myocardial injury, cardiac injury, coronary artery disease (CAD), acute myocardial infarct, acute coronary syndrome, or heart failure (HF). Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) patients were confirmed to have been infected by SARS-CoV-2; and (2) numbers of the preexisting CVD risk, numbers of severe cases and non-severe cases were reported. Reviews, editorials, non-human studies, duplicate publications, only children cases, letters without sufficient data, studies without preexisting CVD risk were excluded. We classified severe disease as patients with confirmed COVID-19 who admitted to the intensive care unit, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, elevated troponin, the progression of the disease, required mechanical ventilation, or death. Quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale, a validated scale for non-randomized studies in meta-analyses. Conflicts were resolved through consensus. We assigned scores of 0\u20133, 3.5\u20136, and 6.5\u20139 for low, moderate, and high quality of studies, respectively. Random-effects meta-analyses were used. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. We defined substantial heterogeneity between the studies if I\n2 > 50%. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 11 (Stata Corp), and all tests were two-sided with a significance level of 0.05.",

The proportion of DM, HTN, CAD, HF and CVD events were all statistically significant higher in patients with severe COVID-19 disease compared to non-severe COVID-19 disease [DM: OR = 3.02, 95% CI (2.07\u20134.42), I\n2 = 39.7%, P < 0.001; HTN: OR = 4.56, 95% CI (1.96\u201310.59), I\n2 = 91.7%, P < 0.001; CAD: OR = 6.85, 95% CI (3.81\u201312.3), I\n2 = 48.1%, P < 0.001; HF: OR = 9.77, 95% CI (5.36\u201317.79), I\n2 = 0%, P < 0.001; CVD events: OR = 8.89, 95% CI (4.04\u201319.5), I\n2 = 66.9%, P < 0.001]. However, the proportion smoking was not statistically significant higher in patients with severe COVID-19 disease compared to non-severe COVID-19 disease [smoking: OR = 2.75, 95% CI (0.46\u201316.3), I\n2 = 92.3%, P < 0.001]. Only one study reported angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use accounted for 21.1% of severe COVID-19 disease, but 5.8% of non-severe COVID-19 disease. There were no significant interactions among the subgroups using quality assessment. There was no study markedly affecting the summary estimate or P-values for heterogeneity of all groups (see Fig. 1\n).",

First, although smoking has been demonstrated to be a CVD risk factor and has known adverse effects on heart and lung function,1 surprisingly, we could not find the association of the COVID-19 severity and smoking. This may be confounded by the frequency of smoking, duration of smoking, or lung function. Second, we found that DM, HTN, CAD, HF, overall CVD events were associated with severe COVID-19 cases, compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases. Previous studies showed that age, high body mass index, and low CD4 T cell count were independently associated with severe COVID-19 disease.2\n,\n3\n",
