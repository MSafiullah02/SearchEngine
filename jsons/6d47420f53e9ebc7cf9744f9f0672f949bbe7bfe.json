            "text": "Purpose LSG surgery is used for surgical treatment of morbid obesity. Obesity, anesthesia, and pneumoperitoneum cause reduced pulmoner functions and a tendency for atelectasis. The alveolar \"recruitment\" maneuver (RM) keeps airway pressure high, opening alveoli, and increasing arterial oxygenation. The aim of our study is to research the effect on respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases of performing the RM in LSG surgery. Materials and Methods Sixty patients undergoing LSG surgery were divided into two groups (n = 30) Patients in group R had the RM performed 5 min after desufflation with 100% oxygen, 40 cmH 2 O pressure for 40 s. Group C had standard mechanical ventilation. Assessments of respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases were made in the 10th min after induction (T1), 10th min after insufflation (T2), 5th min after desufflation (T3), and 15th min after desufflation (T4). Arterial blood gases were assessed in the 30th min (T5) in the postoperative recovery unit. Results In group R, values at T5, PaO 2 were significantly high, while PaCO 2 were significantly low compared with group C. Compliance in both groups reduced with pneumoperitoneum. At T4, the compliance in the recruitment group was higher. In both groups, there was an increase in PIP with pneumoperitoneum and after desufflation this was identified to reduce to levels before pneumoperitoneum. Conclusion Adding the RM to PEEP administration for morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG surgery is considered to be effective in improving respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gas values and can be used safely.",

Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise and medical treatment, in addition to surgical interventions, are frequently used for treatment of obesity [2] . Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a new approach for surgical treatment of morbid obesity [3] . With the increase in surgical interventions for obesity treatment, it is necessary to take more care for anesthesia management of these patients [4] . Obese patients have increased possibility of difficult intubation, in addition to displaying more unwanted effects on the respiratory system, compared with normal patients [5, 6] . Obesity is an important respiratory risk factor as it causes reduced functional residual capacity, compliance and oxygenation in terms of respiratory functions before and after both surgery and anesthesia, in addition to causing a tendency for atelectasis [7, 8] . Reduced functional residual capacity causes airway closure in situations with delayed endotracheal intubation and obese patients in the supine position become rapidly desaturated. Additionally, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and obstructive sleep apnea should be carefully questioned [9] .",

The lungs which are already susceptible to atelectasis due to general anesthesia experience increased severity of this effect during laparoscopy [10] . The amelioration of atelectasis developing during general anesthesia for obese patients is slower after the operation compared with nonobese patients. Atelectasis is fully resorbed 24 h after the end of the surgical procedure for nonobese patients, while atelectasis was shown to continue in obese patients at this point [11] . One of the most important aims of anesthesia management during operations on obese patients is to keep the airway and alveoli open during respiration [12] . The techniques of keeping airway pressure high for a duration to open atelectatic areas with the \"recruitment maneuver\" (RM) and positive expiration end pressure (PEEP) may reduce atelectasis and increase oxygenation [13] .",

When analyzing findings obtained in the study, the IBM SPSS version 20 (IBM SPSS, Turkey) program was used for statistical analysis. A statistical power analysis was performed for sample size estimation, based on data from published study, Whalen et al. [14] . In the present study, effect size was estimated as 0.77, alpha was defined as 0.05, and power as 0.90, the projected sample size needed with this effect size (GPower 3.1) is approximately N = 58. A total of 29 patients would be required in each group for this simplest between group comparisons. When assessing study data, fit of parameters to normal distribution was evaluated with the Shapiro-Wilk test. When assessing study data, descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, frequency) were used. For comparison of quantitative data with parameters showing normal distribution, two groups were compared with the student t test, while comparison of two groups without normal distribution used the Mann-Whitney U test. Analysis of more than two measurements obtained in a single group for values without normal distribution used the Friedman test. Significance was assessed at p < 0.05 level. After the Friedman test, two-way comparisons of within-group measurements used the Wilcoxon signed ranks test to identify the difference. For blood gas measurements, significance for 5 measurements with a total of 10 two-way comparisons was evaluated at the p < 0.005 level and for respiratory mechanics, significance for 4 measurements with a total of 6 two-way comparisons was evaluated at p < 0.008 level.",

However, in the literature, PEEP applied after the recruitment maneuver and less than 80% FiO 2 administration methods recommended to maintain physiological oxygenation [15, 16] . Lung-protective ventilation strategy (aproximately 8 ml kg \u22121 tidal volume and administered using estimated true body weight), PEEP administration, and alveolar recruitment maneuvers prevent atelectasis and positively affect intraoperative gas exchange which prevents the development of hypoxemia [12, 17] . High PEEP administration prevents the decrease in lung volume at the end of expirium formed by increased intraabdominal pressure and in this way is reported to have positive effects on respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and PaO 2 values in morbidly obese patients [18, 19] . A variety of studies have reported that administration of PEEP with the RM ensures better oxygenation and compliance compared with patients with only PEEP applied [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . With the aim of investigating the effects of PEEP and recruitment, there are studies performed by CT or MR imaging for each patient and evaluated according to the results of these imaging methods [25] [26] [27] . Two studies by Rothen et al. [26, 27] administered at least 40 cmH 2 O pressure for 7-8 s duration and observed that all atelectatic lung tissues opened, there was a marked reduction in the amount of shunt and oxygenation significantly improved. Henzler et al. [28] in an animal study performed the recruitment maneuver with 45 cmH 2 O pressure for 40 s and found the RM provided an increase in ventilation of weakly ventilated lung volumes. In our study, we attempted to determine the efficacy of PEEP and RM using respiratory mechanics values and arterial blood gas measurements due to the cost increase caused by these imaging methods and the technical difficulties of performing CT and MR imaging for obese patients. We used PEEP and the RM together. Talab et al. [29] stated there was better oxygenation, less atelectasis, and less postoperative respiratory complications with no barotrauma encountered in the group with 10 cmH 2 O PEEP and 40 cmH 2 O recruitment procedure for 7-8 s. Golparvar et al. [30] performed in their study in 3 groups; multiple deep breathing maneuvers, PEEP, and both.",

In our study, during the operation, PEEP administrated with 8 cmH 2 O at the beginning before insufflation lasted until the end of the operation, while the RM was performed 5 min after desufflation with 40 cmH 2 O pressure for 40 s duration. We used 100% oxygen only during the RM and as part of this maneuver for only 40 s. This is the limitation of our study. Although we used this FiO 2 value, there was no difference between the groups in the T4 measurements performed at the 15th min after desufluation. T5 was the 30th min measurement after extubation and the difference between the two groups appeared in this measurement. This difference was more relevant with the pressure and duration we used. In fact, in one study, recruitment maneuver with low oxygen concentration has been shown to be more effective for oxygenation. [31] We found that the PaO 2 value in the recruitment group was significantly high compared with the control group at T5. Hemmes et al. [32] [7, 8, 10] . Findings during open surgery may be different from laparoscopic surgery. As a result, we applied relatively high PEEP along with the RM in our study. Arterial blood gas analysis are one of the best methods to assess pulmonary function. The first parameter examined to assess the acid-base balance is pH [33] . Iwasaka et al. [34] investigated that blood gas analysis during laparoscopic surgery with increased intraabdominal pressure and CO 2 insufflation decreases in arterial pH and increases in PaCO 2 values due to CO 2 retention. When we assessed pH, HCO 3 , and PaCO 2 data in our study, we did not identify a difference between the two groups for pH values; however, we determined a decrease pH values at T2, T3, and T4 in both groups compared with the T1 pH value. In our study, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of HCO 3 values. We did not identify any difference between the groups in terms of PaCO 2 values during surgery. However, the PaCO 2 value in the recruitment group examined in blood gases at T5 was low compared with the control group PaCO 2 value (within normal limits). With pneumoperitoneum, PaCO 2 values increase, while this value decreases after pneumoperitoneum and we identified that this was significant in the recruitment group.",

After desufflation, PIP and Pplateau decrease and compliance increases; however, it was shown to be 14% reduced compared with the value before insufflation [38] . It is proposed that the RM performed after desufflation in laparoscopic surgery is effective to completely regain lung compliance [35] . According to the data obtained in our study, we think the RM performed with PEEP has greater positive effects on compliance. When Raw is investigated, contrary to previous studies [36] , we found Raw reduced during surgery. PIP values in both groups increased with insufflation, and we identified they regressed to values before pneumoperitoneum with desufflation.
