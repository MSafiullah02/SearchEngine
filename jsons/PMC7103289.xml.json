            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a coronavirus belonging to Group 1 of the family Coronaviridae. FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) protein, transmembrane (M) protein, and peplomer spike (S) protein (Olsen, 1993). FCoV is classified into types I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its spike protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Motokawa et al., 1995, Motokawa et al., 1996). Each of these types consists of two viruses: FIP-causing FIP virus (FIPV) and non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FIPV and FECV of the same type cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity or at the gene level, and differ only in their pathogenicity for cats. Thus, there are types I and II FECV and FIPV in FCoV. FECV is asymptomatic in cats, but FIPV infection induces feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP is a fatal disease mainly developing immune complex vasculitis accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation. The difference in pathogenicity between FECV and FIPV is considered to be associated with macrophage tropism of each virus (Rottier et al., 2005).",

These phenomena are known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. There have been several reports concerning ADE of other virus infections (dengue virus, HIV and respiratory syncytial virus, etc.; Suhrbier and La Linn, 2003, Sullivan, 2001, Tirado and Yoon, 2003), and ADE of SARS-CoV infection, belonging to coronavirus as FIPV, has recently been reported (Weingartl et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2005). ADE of FIPV infection has been reported to be induced by antibodies against FIPV spike (S) protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991b, Corapi et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1992). FIPV infects macrophages via the virus-bound anti-FIPV-S antibody Fc region and Fc receptor on the macrophage surface, inducing ADE. ADE-induced aggravation of the pathology in FIP cats is considered to be due to an increased viral infection rate in macrophages.",

Increases in the IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels in FIP cats have been confirmed (Goitsuka et al., 1990, Goitsuka et al., 1991, Dean et al., 2003, Takano et al., 2007). Of these cytokines, TNF-alpha is a feline lymphocyte apoptosis-inducing factor, and its involvement in lymphopenia in FIP cats has been suggested (Dean et al., 2003, Takano et al., 2007). Increased TNF-alpha expression in monocytes and macrophages in FIP cats has been noted (Dean et al., 2003, Kipar et al., 2005, Takano et al., 2007). Kiss et al. (2004) reported that the expression level of TNF-alpha mRNA in FIP cat-derived PBMC was increased, whereas that of IFN-gamma mRNA was reduced. However, many points remain unclear, such as whether this increase in TNF-alpha is directly related to FIPV replication in macrophages, and whether induction of ADE of FIPV infection in macrophages affects TNF-alpha production.",

Feline alveolar macrophages were inoculated with a mixture of FIPV inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min and MAb 6-4-2, and TNF-alpha production was investigated with time. When macrophages were inoculated with a mixture of non-heat-inactivated (live) FIPV and MAb 6-4-2, the intracellular TNF-alpha mRNA expression level (Fig. 2A) and the culture supernatant TNF-alpha level (Fig. 2B) increased with time. However, in macrophages inoculated with a mixture of heat-inactivated FIPV and MAb 6-4-2, both levels were significantly lower than those in cells inoculated with a mixture of live FIPV and MAb on days 2 and 3 of culture (Figs. 2A and B).",

This ADE-induced aggravation of the pathology in FIP cats has been interpreted that binding of FIPV with antibodies elevates the macrophage infection efficiency, increasing virus production. We demonstrated that TNF-alpha production was elevated with an increase in virus production in macrophages inoculated with a mixture of antibody and FIPV (ADE-induced FIPV-infected macrophages). When macrophages were inoculated with heat-inactivated FIPV, TNF-alpha production was not increased, suggesting that FIPV replication in macrophages is necessary to induce TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is a cytokine involved in the regulation of immune function, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. However, overproduction of TNF-alpha is known to have a negative influence on the body. For example, aggravation of the pathology by overproduction of TNF-alpha in inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, and viral infections, such as dengue and Ebola virus infections, has been reported (Atrasheuskaya et al., 2003, Schreiber et al., 1999, Shanahan and St Clair, 2001, Stroher et al., 2001).",

Furthermore, we revealed that fAPN expression was increased in macrophages infected with FIPV in vitro, particularly in ADE-induced FIPV-infected macrophages, and confirmed the presence of a factor inducing fAPN expression in the culture supernatant of these macrophages. Heating this culture supernatant at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min did not inactivate the fAPN expression-inducing activity, suggesting that this factor is heat-resistant. Since the TNF-alpha level was increased in the FIPV-infected macrophage culture supernatant, as described above, and TNF-alpha is heat-resistant, we predicted that this fAPN-inducing factor is TNF-alpha. To verify this hypothesis, we treated macrophages with recombinant feline TNF-alpha, and investigated its influence on fAPN expression. As we expected, the fAPN expression level was increased in the macrophages. We speculated that TNF-alpha may have been produced as FIPV replicated, and autocrinally or paracrinally acted on macrophages and promoted fAPN expression. To verify this concept, it is necessary to examine whether anti-feline TNF-alpha antibody can inhibit the ability of the FIPV-infected macrophage culture supernatant to induce fAPN in macrophages. We also revealed that infection of recombinant feline TNF-alpha-treated macrophages with FIPV increased FIPV production. TNF-alpha is known to affect other viral infections. It has been reported that TNF-alpha makes vascular endothelial cell invasion by viruses easier in Ebola virus infection (Yonezawa et al., 2005). In rhinovirus infection, when cells were infected after treatment with TNF-alpha, the infection efficiency was increased compared to that in untreated cells (Subauste et al., 1995), and this was considered to be due to an increase in the expression level of the rhinovirus receptor, ICAM-1 (Shafren et al., 1999). In FIPV infection, TNF-alpha may similarly act on macrophages and increase the fAPN expression level, increasing FIPV sensitivity.",

TNF-alpha production was significantly increased in ADE-induced FIPV-infected macrophages compared to macrophages infected with FIPV alone. It was suggested that when humoral immunity is induced in FIPV-infected cats, ADE induces viral replication in macrophages and overproduction of TNF-alpha, resulting in: 1) lymphocyte apoptosis induction, and 2) advanced FIP onset due to the virus sensitivity being upregulated by the increased virus receptor (fAPN) expression in macrophages. Based on the fact that weakly pathogenic FECV is less likely to infect macrophages than fatal FIPV, Rottier et al.
