            "text": "Although effective, its efficacy is not absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third \"ghost\" deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly, when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only exception. Finally, the different viral population pattern observed in the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall, the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.",

Even when infectious bronchitis is properly controlled (i.e. asymptomatic infections), some economic losses have been reported in subclinically infected flocks 7 . Moreover, the co-circulation of field and live attenuated vaccines could enhance the likelihood of recombination and the vaccine induced immunity could promote and/or guide viral evolution 8, 9 .",

The risk factors of virus introduction in a farm have been investigated in several studies, and include transport of live poultry, species and productive category, dominant winds 10,11 , sharing of personnel, fomites and means of transportation [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Other routes of transmission are summarized under the umbrella of 'contiguous spread' . However, most of these studies are based on single outbreaks, during emergency scenarios (e.g. avian influenza outbreaks), and on the evaluation of factors associated to farm infection using a traditional statistical approach 17,18 . Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis of the ecological aspects behind the spread of IBV is largely lacking. Recently, advances in bioinformatics tools have allowed to link viral phylogeny and evolution to epidemiological factors, modeling the process of viral spreading over time, investigating its determinants and integrating landscape ecology with molecular epidemiology 19 . Therefore, a more accurate evaluation of IBV spreading determinants, informed on data collected over several years, could contribute in the understanding of this disease epidemiology.",

However, a quite different scenario was demonstrated between the two integrated poultry companies. In fact, Company A was featured by a substantially constant population size, with a minor decrease affecting particularly the period 2013-2015. However, the Ne*t 95HPD were relatively broad and at odds with the significance of the observed variations. On the contrary, a much more changeable pattern was observed in Company B (Fig. 2) .",

All the samples phylogenetically belonging to Company A but collected from Company B originated from farms located in the high densely populated area of Northern Italy (Fig. 1) . The continuous phylogeographic analysis reconstructed a spreading pattern originating from a single introduction in Emilia Romagna region (Company A), followed by a progressive expansion and persistence at high level in the Pianura Padana region. More rarely, spreading episodes toward other Italian regions were observed (Fig. 4) . After QX introduction, the infection wave front increased slowly approximatively until 2009, when a rapid expansion led to the final distribution range by the middle of 2012 (Fig. 5) . Accordingly, the dispersal velocity progressively increased in the first years after QX genotype introduction, peaking in the period 2009-2011 and then remaining essentially constant, despite some fluctuations (Fig. 5) . The presence of a high dispersal velocity after 2012, when no further increase in wave front was observed, suggests that IBV continued to circulate at high rate after its first establishment in a region.",

            "text": "The implemented approach allowed to reconstruct the migration history of the QX genotype over time. The estimated introduction, in Emilia Romagna region, shortly predates the first detection, posing in favor of the effectiveness of the Italian monitoring and early detection systems. All the analyses, independently of the underlying statistical model, support that Company A was the first introduction site (Fig. 3) . Thereafter, the virus circulation was limited to farms belonging to this company for years, until approximatively 2010, when Company B became involved. Contextually, a progressive increase in diffusion speed was noticed (Fig. 5) , not unexpectedly considering the rising number of involved farms (especially at the border between Veneto and Lombardy regions, where most farms are located) and thus the increase in spreading potential and opportunity. The high farm density of this area has been described as a risk factor for different infectious diseases 22 , and IBV seems to be no exception. Interestingly, the viral population size remained relatively constant in this time period, evidencing that, even if QX strains were able to effectively spread from farm to farm, their replication was adequately controlled, likely by effective vaccination strategies. Actually, a certain slowdown in dispersal velocity was noticed in 2011-12, potentially because of a progressive decrease in naive populations availability. A dramatic change was observed in 2014, when a new spreading wave (Fig. 4) and an increase in diffusion rate (Fig. 5 ) and population size (Fig. 2) were detected. A more detailed analysis demonstrated that this variation affected Company B only (Fig. 2) . A previous study has ascribed this episode to a change in the vaccination scheme adopted by this company, which moved from a heterologous Mass+793B based vaccination to a Mass only vaccination leading to an increased viral circulation and clinical outbreaks number 4 . Moreover, experimental studies demonstrated a significant reduction in R 0 in vaccinated groups compared to unvaccinated ones 28 . It can therefore be speculated that the increase in infectious pressure within-farm and the higher flock susceptibility to infection could have enhanced the risk of IBV spreading to other farms and regions. In support of this hypothesis, the geographical spreading affected mainly Northern Italian farms (where Company B is located). Moreover, when a new double vaccination was implemented, the decrease in viral population size was mirrored by a reduction of dispersal velocity. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Continuous phylogeography showed that the areas interested by a more intensive viral circulation were those featured by a higher poultry density, and this evidence was confirmed by a statistically significant correlation between poultry density and dispersal velocity. The association between spatial proximity and farm infection is probably the most consistently reported risk factor for poultry infectious diseases 17, 23, 29 . Although an airborne transmission has been proposed for IBV, its occurrence has rarely been demonstrated experimentally 30 . However, the spatial proximity likely increases the likelihood of a greater number of horizontal contacts between farms, including the movement of people, vehicles and fomites between farms, as well as sharing similar risk factors (e.g. environmental conditions, climate, presence of wild animals, etc.) 16, 23 . Based on these premises, the presence of segregated poultry companies should represent an effective obstacle to viral shedding and the obtained results partially confirm these evidence. The strains from different poultry companies formed two independent clusters, which suggests the effectiveness of independent production flow/chain in protecting farms from exogenous introductions. Additionally, the application of adequate biosecurity measures, enforced also by the Italian legislation, likely contributed in limiting new strain introduction.",

The unidirectionality of the viral flux from Company A to Company B implies that other factors, besides spatial proximity, must be in place. A detailed survey could shed some insights into relevant factors like different biosecurity measures, structural factors, vaccination strategy etc.. The mediation of other \"actors\" cannot also be excluded. In fact, the analysis of just two companies, however predominant they are on the Italian poultry sector, cannot be considered an accurate depiction of the Italian situation. Remarkably, the inclusion of a third deme (representative of other unsampled companies and farms) in the analysis model highlighted that several transmission events could be mediated by smaller entities operating in the same region. Actually, the high migration rate estimated between Company B and this ghost deme poses in favor of its pivotal role in maintaining an active IBV circulation.",

Since also Company A was evaluated in the same analysis run, the absence of relevant links between this company and the ghost deme further supports the analysis reliability, posing in favor of an actual interaction between Company B and the ghost deme rather than a mere low specificity of the method. A less effective control of IBV infection could be speculated for small companies, whose management capability and resources are limited compared to big-integrated companies. In fact, all Italian farms have to follow national legislation 33 dictating the minimum biosecurity measures to be applied. However, integrated poultry farms, part of major companies, enforce additional managerial practices to increase biosecurity levels. Personnel and veterinarian formation, internal audits and periodic controls guarantee a higher level of application of the required standards, compared to most of small non-integrated farms.",

However, differences between Company A and Company B in the application of biosecurity measures and production flow management could also explain the different IBV epidemiology, as demonstrated by the dissimilar patterns in viral population fluctuations in the two companies (Fig. 2) . A further risk factor that would deserve further investigation is the presence of the rural sector, which is highly concentrated in the densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. This sector is characterized by a complex mix of growers, dealers and backyards flocks, often applying poor biosecurity measures and linked together by a poorly traceable contact network 34 . Although interactions with industrial poultry farming is hardly discouraged, illegal/indirect interactions have been documented and multiple epidemiological connections could result in a bidirectional transmission between the two sectors, as demonstrated in the Italian low pathogenicity Avian influenza (AI) outbreaks occurred in 2007-2009 34 . After these episodes, a stricter legislation has been developed, imposing limits to animal movements and more active surveillance in the rural sector. Nevertheless, no measures were taken for the monitoring and control of IBV in these enterprises, and therefore their role as sources of encroachment in intensive farming cannot be excluded.",

More surprising could be the non-significant role of road density. However, it must be stressed that the available raster reported the overall density of roads, which could significantly differ from those preferentially used for live animal or their byproduct transportation, hindering the detection of an otherwise plausible risk factor.

Actually, the integration of poultry production seems to provide a relevant constrain to IBV circulation, even though some differences were noted between the two considered companies. In fact, despite differences in management and applied control strategies likely playing a role, the presence in the same area of other minor poultry companies seems to represent a major issue, probably due to the less effective infection control ascribable to the sometimes lower organization capability and resources of small enterprises. The present study results emphasize the need of an active sharing of sequences and related molecular epidemiology data originating from all the actors in poultry production, allowing a proper depiction of the viral exchange dynamics, based on actual data rather www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ than estimations.

A null coefficient of determination (R 2 null ) was also calculated assuming the null raster (i.e. when only the spatial distance of each movement is assumed to affect branch duration). The statistic D = R 2 env -R 2 null was selected as final outcome, and describes how much the regression is strengthened when the spatial variation in the environmental variable is included. To account for the phylogenetic uncertainness, the D statistic was calculated for each tree of the posterior distribution. However, for computational constraints, the number of posterior trees was down-sampled to 1000 after discharging a 20% burn-in. Only the environmental variables with more than 90% of D statistics > 0 were considered for further analysis. Particularly, the significance of D statistic of those variables was assessed against a D null distribution obtained by randomizing 1000 times the phylogenetic nodes location under the constraint that branch length remained equal. A p-value was generated for each initial tree, therefore a percentage of the trees with p-value < 0.05 could be calculated, which can be interpreted as a posterior probability of observing a significant correlation between lineage movements and considered environmental variable. According to , a percentage of p-value < 0.05 greater than 50% was considered a strong evidence that the environmental variable is associated to viral movement speed 19 .",

Branch colors, as from legend, mark the inferred company where the ancestral strain was circulating, while branch width represents the posterior confidence of the inference. The trees reconstructed assuming just the Company A and B demes (left figure) and the one including also the ghost deme (right figure) are reported. In the top left insert it is reported the network depicting the migration rate between Company A and Company B. Arrows and circles size are proportional to the inferred migration rate and population size, respectively. Similarly, the top right insert reports the network of the migration rate between Company A, Company B and ghost demes.
