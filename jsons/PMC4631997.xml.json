These SNPs likely co-segregate with polymorphisms that directly affect biological functions related to IFNL expression or activity. To identify candidate functional variants in the IFNL3 gene region, we searched for variants in high linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860 (hereafter referred to as the \u2018discovery SNP\u2019) by analysis of available human genome sequence data (1000genomes.org). We identified a SNP (rs4803217) in the 3\u2032 UTR of IFNL3 that is highly correlated (best tagging SNP according to 1000 Genomes Project) to the discovery SNP31323334 (Fig. 1A). The rs4803217 G allele is correlated with the protective C allele of the discovery SNP. This variant was an intriguing candidate as the source of viral infection-related phenotypes because 3\u2032 UTRs often contain cis-acting RNA elements that control mRNA translation and decay. Rs4803217 is also flanked by AU-rich elements (AREs; Fig. 1B), sequence motifs that have been linked to post-transcriptional gene regulation35. Therefore, we conducted a large-scale genetic association study examining rs4803217 and HCV clearance in a cohort of chronically-infected patients.",

The sample sizes of both populations are sufficient to achieve greater than 0.99 in statistical power (1.00 in European-American and 0.992 in African-American under the significance level of 0.01). Linkage disequilibrium analysis in HCV patients revealed that rs4803217 is strongly associated with rs12979860 in European-American patients (r2 > 0.97; Table 1), with somewhat lower linkage disequilibrium in African-Americans (r2 = 0.913). We performed association tests of rs4803217 with clinical phenotypes using logistic regression. The association of rs4803217 with sustained virological response (defined as absence of detectable HCV RNA in serum at least 24 weeks after discontinuation of treatment) was extremely significant (p = 2.48 \u00d710\u221225) in the European-American population (Table 1). The discovery SNP has been previously associated with viral burden such that patients with the protective allele (C) exhibit a slightly higher baseline viral load2. We found that rs4803217 exhibited comparable association with pre-treatment baseline viral load by linear regression in both European- and African-Americans compared with the discovery SNP (Table 2).",

We took advantage of a stable HeLa cell line that harbors a genomic flippase recognition target site38 to create isogenic cell lines with distinct Renilla luciferase (RLuc) reporter constructs controlled by a CMV promoter that is transcriptionally regulated by tetracycline repressor protein. This system allows characterization of gene expression in cells containing a single copy of the reporter gene. Three cell lines were established containing either RLuc alone or RLuc fused to each of the two IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR variants (Fig. 1C). The presence of either IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR caused modest but statistically significant (p = 0.028 for G allele, p = 0.046 for T allele, unpaired t-test) reductions in the levels of IFNL3 chimeric mRNAs compared to RLuc alone (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, levels of the RLuc protein were reduced by a much larger amount, 4- and 7-fold for the rs4803217 G and T reporters, respectively, compared to the reporter lacking an IFNL3 3\u2019 UTR (Fig. 1E). The differential effects on mRNA versus protein levels strongly suggest that the IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR regulates gene expression by repressing the efficiency of mRNA translation rather than mRNA abundance in HeLa cells. Importantly, the 3\u2032 UTR SNP affected the magnitude of this repression: the rs4803217 T allele produced approximately 50% less RLuc than did the corresponding G allele mRNA (Fig. 1E; p = 0.0005, unpaired t-test). Induction of reporter mRNA expression levels by tetracycline treatment reduced RLuc differences between the cell lines, suggesting that reporter mRNA over-expression led to escape from endogenous regulatory factor(s) present in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S2A,B). We also tested the IFNL3 reporter constructs in an immortalized human hepatocyte cell line (PH5CH8), a human hepatoma cell line (LH86), and HeLa cells by transient plasmid transfection (Supplementary Figure S2C). In each cell line, the patterns of reporter expression mirrored that in the stable HeLa cell lines (Fig. 1E).",

            "text": "We next directly tested the hypothesis that rs4803217 regulated efficiency of mRNA translation. We used polysome profiling to examine whether the variant IFNL3 reporter mRNAs were differentially associated with translating ribosomes in stable HeLa cell lines. The extent of association with multiple ribosomes is an indication of mRNA translation efficiency. IFNL3 variant reporter cell lines, grown to equal densities, were harvested, lysed and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate non-translating and ribosome-associated mRNA. Gradients were subsequently fractionated and RLuc reporter and GAPDH mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR. Ribosomal RNA sedimentation patterns from the IFNL3 two reporter cell lines were nearly identical (Fig. 2A), indicating that bulk mRNA translation rates did not differ between cell lines. In contrast, the rs4803217 G and T IFNL3 reporter mRNAs showed distinct profiles across the gradient. Across three biological replicates, the G allele mRNA was more highly represented in denser gradient fractions, reflecting incorporation into polysomes, than the T allele mRNA (Fig. 2B,C and Supplementary Figure S3). We quantified the areas underneath the lines for both G and T alleles and found that the allelic difference in area between polysome fractions (fractions 7\u201312) and non-polysome (fractions 1\u20136) fractions were significantly different (p = 0.01) (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that the G allele mRNA was more abundant in polysome fractions compared to the T allele mRNA. Correspondingly, levels of non-translating mRNA (sedimenting between the 40S ribosomal subunit and the 80S monosome) were higher for the rs4803217 T mRNA. We did note that a significant amount (15%) of the T-allele reporter mRNA was found in dense gradient fractions (10\u201312), suggesting that a portion of the T allele reporter mRNA escapes repression and is efficiently translated. Combined with the discrepant luciferase protein and reporter mRNA measurements shown in Fig. 1, these data strongly suggest that the rs4803217 SNP regulates efficiency of IFNL3 reporter mRNA translation in HeLa cells.",

A growing body of evidence indicates that 3\u2032 UTR structure regulates mRNA translation and decay by modulating interactions with trans-acting factors40. Moreover, genetic variants that alter mRNA structure and function, termed RiboSNitches, have been described41. We directly examined whether the rs4803217 SNP physically modulates the structure of endogenously expressed IFNL3 mRNA using selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE)42. We examined the structure of IFNL3 mRNA under non-denaturing conditions in the context of total purified cellular RNA. SHAPE analysis was performed on deproteinized RNA as this approach allows for direct assessment of mRNA structure independently of trans-acting proteins or RNAs. The structure of the IFNL3 mRNA was probed using the fast-reacting SHAPE reagent 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7) and products were analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using the SHAPE-MaP strategy43 (Supplementary Figure S4). We used human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells for these experiments because they express IFNL3 mRNA upon transfection with poly(I:C) (Supplementary Figure S5A). Importantly, A549 cells are heterozygous at rs4803217 and levels of mRNA from each allele were directly correlated with the gene dosage (Supplementary Figure S5B). Using the MaP approach, sequencing reads derived from IFNL3 were sorted by SNP identity at rs4803217; this made it possible to examine the structures of both alleles under identical conditions in the same experiment (Supplementary Figure S4). SHAPE data were collected on a 266 nt long region of the IFNL3 mRNA containing the last 125 nt of the coding sequence (including the stop codon) and the 3\u2032 UTR, excluding the terminal 23 nt and the poly(A) tail.",

The rs4803217 G allele had lower SHAPE reactivity, and thus more stable structure, near the region close to rs4803217 than did the T allele (Fig. 3A). We next calculated Shannon entropy values for each rs4803217 allele. Shannon entropies are derived from a SHAPE-directed partition function and report a measure of whether an RNA region is likely to form a single well-defined structure434445. The median Shannon entropies across the IFNL3\u2032 UTR were much lower for the G allele, especially near the rs4803217 site, than for the T variant (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figure S6). We next performed a correlation analysis of SHAPE reactivities between the G and T alleles by calculating R2 across the mRNA regions to address the overall structural similarity between the two alleles (Fig. 3C). The SHAPE reactivities in the open reading frame (ORF) are highly correlated between alleles, and moderately correlated at the very end of 3\u2032 UTR. In contrast, a very low or zero correlation was observed in the region of rs4803217. This indicates that a drastic local change in structure is induced by the SNP. In sum, the G allele 3\u2032 UTR adopts an overall well-defined, highly structured conformation; whereas, nucleotide-resolution SHAPE probing indicates that the T allele adopts multiple conformations. In addition, structural differences between the two 3\u2032 UTR alleles are centered on the SNP region.",

This difference in relative free energy is close to the largest possible increment achievable by altering a single base pair49. We calculated the expected free energy changes for all possible nucleotide changes in the context of the IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR (529 sequence variants) and in the context of the intact mRNA (2851 sequence variants). The increase in folding free energy due to the change from G to U at rs4803217 ranked the highest among all possible substitutions in 3\u2032 UTR, and the third among all possible substitutions in the intact mRNA, indicating that this position has a strong influence on RNA folding (Fig. 4B).

Changing rs4803217 from G to C resulted in reduced expression, similar to the rs4803217 T reporter construct (Fig. 5B). Restoring the predicted base pair in this mutant by introducing a G at nt 45 increased expression, consistent with RNA structure opposing repression. Interestingly, introduction of G at nt 45 (C45G) in the context rs4803217 G, which is predicted to interrupt base-pairing, had increased expression which was opposite of the effect on expression initially expected. However, this mutant resulted in a free energy of RNA folding similar to the rs4803217 G 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. 5B) by inducing a register shift in base pairing and ultimately preserved the stem loop associated with escape from repression48 (Supplementary Figure S8). For each of the constructs analyzed, the expression levels were inversely correlated with folding free energy. Together, the mutagenesis data further reinforce the model that the T-allele has a more variable structure than the G-allele mRNA and that stable structure is associated with enhanced HCV clearance.",

Although cytokine 3\u2032 UTR AREs are commonly associated with enhanced mRNA decay, they have also been implicated as translational regulators50515253 and mRNA decay and translation are closely associated cytoplasmic processes5455. Due to gene regulation at the level of mRNA translation, the modest differences in IFNL3 mRNA levels, as a function of genotype, reported in some studies may underestimate actual differences in IFNL3 protein levels, as we observed here for the IFNL3 rs4803217 SNP (Fig. 1). This is consistent with a recent report of ~ 7-fold differences in IFNL2/3 serum levels between HCV patients who are homozygous at the discovery SNP26. Consistent with this work, a recent independent study identified a distinction between CC versus non-CC genotype (discovery SNP) for IFNL3 protein plasma levels27. However, we acknowledge that our results do not formally establish a causal relationship between rs4803217 and IFNL3 levels in patients.",

We discovered that the nucleotide at rs4803217 influenced the global structure of IFNL3 mRNA.

            "text": "The observed change in protein expression is likely the result of differential binding of trans-acting factors, induced by the differential folding of the 3\u2032 UTR variants. The SHAPE-derived secondary structures show that rs4803217 T reduces structure of a region overlapping ARE1 and 2 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that unidentified trans-acting ARE-binding proteins may access these elements more efficiently in the T allele mRNA. Recently, McFarland et al. reported that the IFNL3 mRNA is regulated by AU-rich elements and also targeted by muscle-specific micro(mi)RNAs (miR-208b and miR-499a-5p) whose expression is triggered by HCV replication. These authors found that rs4803217 was functional using IFNL3 reporter mRNAs. However, the SNP did not confer regulation when ARE1 or ARE2 were mutated, in agreement with our observation that rs4803217 alters structural conformation of regions encompassing ARE1 and ARE2. With respect to the mechanism involving action of miRNAs, the rs4803217 T to G allele would disrupt miRNA-mRNA seed base-pairing29. Thus, the dramatic effects of rs4803217 on IFNL3 mRNA structure that we report here may regulate interactions with ARE-binding proteins and miRNAs. However, we note that, when the SNP position was mutated to a C, we observed a level of reporter expression similar to that of the T-allele (Fig. 5B). The rs4803217 C mutation abolishes seed-region base-pairing to the proposed regulatory miRNAs, similar to the G-allele. This suggests that the regulation we characterized in HeLa cells, which may lack expression of the implicated miRNAs, is mediated primarily by effects of RNA structure on interaction with trans-acting factor(s) other than miR-208b or miR-499a-5P. Further study is needed to define the complement of relevant trans-acting factors that may differentially regulate variant IFNL3 mRNA transcripts through repression of translation and/or induction of mRNA decay.",

In the rs368234815 \u0394G genotype, which is predicted to express IFNL4 and is in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the non-protective (T) rs12979860 allele, IFNL4 production may exert effects that would be unexpectedly deleterious to HCV clearance36.
