            "text": "Most viruses share common spherical or rod-shaped capsids built by multiple subunits of capsid proteins that encapsulate the viral genome. Through bioengineering technology viral capsid proteins can be produced in vitro, resulting in self-assembled, empty virus-like particles (VLPs) (reviewed in [1, 2\u2022\u2022]). In addition, smaller particles with less subunits can be produced for some viruses by expression of portions of the major viral capsid proteins [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These artificial subviral particles retain the structures and antigenic properties of their native viruses, including the virus-specific molecular patterns and high density of B-cell and T-cell epitopes to induce potent innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses, respectively, in animals and humans [1, 2\u2022\u2022]. Thus, these subviral particles are excellent source of materials for vaccine development against many viruses and their associated diseases. VLPs are usually made by an eukaryotic expression system, including the baculovirus/insect cells, yeast, and mammalian cells, while the smaller subviral particles and hepatitis B virus (HBV) VLPs can be produced through the E. coli expression system (Table 1\n), which is more cost-effective. Sevral subviral particle-based vaccines are currently available in the market, while many others are under clinical or preclinical development.",

Through genetic engineering or chemical conjugation heterologous antigens or peptide epitopes can be inserted or conjugated onto the surface of the subviral particles. The polyvalent presentation of the foreign antigens or epitopes on the subviral particles leads to enhanced immunogenicity, providing an effective approach for novel vaccine development. On the other hand, the immunogenicity of the subviral particle is generally maintained without disrupption by the foreign insertion, and thus the chimeric particles can be used as dual or even multivalant vaccines against two or more pathogens. A number of such chimeric particles have been under preclinical development, pointing to a new direction of highly efficient, low cost vaccines against major infectious diseases.",

The two VLP vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are made by L1, the major capsid protein of HPV16 [10], through recombinant yeasts (Gardasil\u00ae, Merck & Co., NJ, USA) or baculoviruses in insect cells (Cervarix\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) [10, 11, 12, 13]. Both vaccines have been proven for the prevention of cervical and anogenital infection and diseases associated with HPVs. The other two commercial VLP vaccines against hepatitis B viruses (HBVs), Recombivax HB\u00ae (Merck & Co., NJ, USA) and Engerix-B\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK), are made by the small surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) through recombinant yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [14, 15]. These vaccines have been proven effective worldwide against HBV infection. Most recently, a further subviral particle vaccine against HEVs, the HEV 239/Hecolin\u00ae (Xiamen Innovax Biotech, Xiamen, China) that is made through the E. coli system, has been proven by the Chinese health authorities for human use in China [16]. In addition, there are two other subviral particle vaccines, the Ingelvac CircoFLEX\u00ae (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) and Porcilis PCV\u00ae (Intervet International, The Netherlands), that are commcercially available for use in domestic pigs against porcine circovirus infection and diseases [17, 18]. Furthermore, the NoV VLP vaccine has shown significant protection against NoV diarrhea in phase II clinical trials [19\u2022\u2022, 20, 21], while many other subviral particle vaccines are under intensive preclinical development (Table 1).",

The highly stable structures of most subviral particles tolerate an exogenous insertion, which can be achieved through either recombinant DNA technology or chemical conjugation. The native antigenic properties of the inserted antigens or epitopes usually are preserved on the surface of the chimeric particles, while the immunogenicity of the antigen/epitope is significantly enhanced by the polyvalent nature of the subviral particles functioning as an adjuvant. In addition, the major antigenic determinants of the subviral particle carriers are generally preserved, and thus the resulting chimeric particles can be used as a dual vaccine against the pathogens of the insertion and the carrier.",

            "text": "The HBV VLP has been extensively studied as a vaccine platform for presentation of heterologous antigens and epitopes, with a chimeric VLP vaccines reaching to phase III and other two to phase I human trials. One is the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline) that comprises of the C-terminal half (189 residues) of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum on the surface of the HBV VLP (HBsAg) with adjuvant AS01 [23\u2022]. This chimeric vaccine is currently under phase III evaluations with high protective efficacy [24\u2022\u2022] and thus will most likely be the first malaria vaccine ever licensed and the first vaccine with a VLP-displayed antigen. Another VLP-based malaria vaccine is ICC-1132 (Malarivax) that is composed of a HBV VLP (HBcAg) displaying multiple epitopes of the P. falciparum CSP [25, 26]. After testing in rodents and nonhuman primates [25], this vaccine candidate was assessed for safety and immunogenicity by a phase I human trial, which showed malaria- and HBV-specific immune responses [26], supportingg ICC-1132 as a potential dual vaccine. The other HBV VLP-based dual vaccine is the M2e-HBcAg chimera, in which the conserved M2e epitope of influenza A virus M2 protein is linked to the HBV VLP through either recombinant DNA technology [27] or chemical conjugation [28]. After a number of animal experiments showing specific immune reponses against the M2e epitope and HBV, as well as protective immunity against influenza virus infection [28, 29, 30, 31], the the first phase I trial was performed in 2008, demonstrating its safety and immunogenicity in humans [32, 33]. These data prove the concept that subviral particle can be a practical strategy of novel vaccine development.",

Both phase I and II human trials of smokers showed high nicotine-specific immune responses in vaccinated subjects and revealed significantly increased abstinence rates of smoking [34, 35].

A phase I human trial confirmed the high immunogenicity and safety of the chimeric vaccine [36]. In a separate study, an epitope of allergen Der p1 was covalently coupled to the Q\u03b2 VLPs (Der-P1-Q\u03b2).

It is also a choice for future vaccines to avoid the safety concerns of conventional live attenuated or inactivated vaccines, such as a safe vaccine for eradication of poliovirus. The recent reports on the increased risk of intussusception of the two live attenuated rotavirus vaccines to vaccinated children [42\u2022, 43, 44] is a new example of such concerns that could be prevented by a non-replicating subunit vaccine. However, based on current technology, it seems not possible to produce subviral particles of all known viral pathogens. Thus, the technology of subviral particle-based antigen presentation provides an important strategy for vaccine development against those viral pathogens. As shown in the two tables, many subviral particles are capable antigen carriers. Since the major antigenic determinants of many viral pathogens are known (Table 2), it would be straightforward for design and producing a new vaccine by taking advantage of this technology.",

            "text": "The past experience suggests that success of a chimeric vaccine may rely on certain levels of structural and/or chemical compatibility between the carriers and the inserted antigens. There is no simple solution to this technical challenge. If such a problem occurs, attempts of other carrier-antigen combinations are encouraged. In addition, a modification of the carrier vectors by including short flexible peptide adaptors to the two arms of the surface loops is an option. Furthermore, the maximal size of an inserted antigen may vary among different carriers, and therefore, selection of proper carriers for larger antigens is also recommended. Finally, selection of appropriate carrier\u2013antigen combinations should be considered based on the target pathogens and host populations. For example, both NoVs and rotaviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in children, the selection of NoV P particle as carrier to present the rotavirus surface antigens is an ideal combination for a highly effective dual vaccine against the two most important causes of acute gastroenteritis in children.",

Thus, development of strategies for a maximal efficacy of the subviral vaccines is important, for which optimization of the vaccine formulations and vaccination regimes may be the key, including increase of vaccine doses and dosages, identification of the best administration routes, and use of appropriate adjuvants. In the case that the antigen-presentation approach is used, rational designs of the vaccines by increasing the copy numbers of the inserted antigens/epitopes on each subviral particle carrier should be considered. In addition, insertion of a universal immunue stimulate elements, such as the T cell epitope, may be considered.",

Since bacteria can produce subviral particles at lower cost, attempt to improve the prokaryotic expression system for production of more subviral particles would help to reduce the cost of vaccine delivery in the developing countries. It is worth to point out that several smaller or simpler subviral particles, including the VLP of HBV (HBcAg) [22], the P particles of NoV [4, 6], the E2 particles of HEV [3, 8], and the small VLP [7] and the L1 capsomeres [45] of HPV, can be readily produced in E. coli with excellent quality and yields. Since all these viral pathogens are prevalent in the developing countries, further study to develop their subviral particles into cost-effective vaccines and vaccine platform for broad application in the developing world is highly significant. Finally, new concept of vaccine delivery, such edible vaccines produced by transgenic vegetbles containing related subviral particles should be explored.",
