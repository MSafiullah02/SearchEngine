Although physicians commonly accept the history of a patient\u2019s underlying illness as valid, treatment for a disorder with potentially toxic agents should always require verification of the diagnosis. It could therefore be argued that the GP was remiss in instituting a cocktail of medications without having a confirmed copy of the test result for HIV infection. This is particularly damaging for an asymptomatic subject with no history of opportunistic infection or clinical evidence of AIDS complication. Moreover, a CD4 count cannot be used as a surrogate marker for the diagnosis of HIV infection.",

Although HIV infection is the most common viral infection associated with CD4+ lymphocytopenia, other viral infections can transiently decrease CD4+ cell counts (including measles, corona viruses and others).8 The list of conditions associated with CD4+ lymphocytopenia (besides viral infections) include bacterial and fungal sepsis (including tuberculosis), major surgery, recent trauma or hemorrhage, malignancy, glucocorticoid use, cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, auto-immune diseases, nutritional deficiencies, organ transplantation, acquired common variable immunodeficiency, and idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia.8 Furthermore, it is common to observe biologic variations in the absolute CD4+ cell count even in HIV infected subjects without any other factors. A healthy adult may have, at some time, transient decrease in CD4+ cell count below 500. Whether the plaintiff\u2019s CD4+ cell count decline was due to viral upper respiratory tract infection or other causes was not clear. In HIV-infected patients, the T lymphocytes decline by 4% per year for every log10 HIV RNA copies/mL in the plasma.7\n",

The risk of developing AIDS within 3 years of seroconversion in subjects who were asymptomatic or had mild illness was only 10% versus 78% (eight times greater) in those with seroconversion illness of at least 14 days.16 Peak viral replication soon after infection occurs in 2\u20134 weeks and levels of virus can exceed >107 copies/mL in plasma. This is associated with a dramatic drop in circulating CD4+ lymphocytes, then a slowing of T-cell loss, and rebound by 9\u201312 weeks. This rebound of CD4+ cells corresponds to a decline in viral load, which reaches a steady state (set point), which is variable by 9\u201312 weeks. Clinical progression of HIV disease has been tied to a set point level with lower levels associated with better prognosis.17 At 1 year after seroconversion, patients demonstrate a fall of about 349 CD4+ cells/mm3 (mean baseline 999 cells/mm3), followed by a more gradual decline in CD4+ cells in the later period of infection.18 There is usually a variable period of 8\u201310 years span before patients develop AIDS (about 50%).

However, by 1994 he had progressed to symptomatic AIDS. Thus, his course was more rapid than usual HIV infected individuals were, and especially as no other conditions or factors were recognized that could accelerate his course of disease. However, the failure of the FP to notify the patient of his HIV-positive status before recognition of his condition was only 1 year. Would an earlier diagnosis by 1 year and assuming institution of ART then, affected the outcome as to lifespan and quality of life? Appropriate treatment a year earlier with ART would likely have aborted or ameliorated his symptomatic disease, of weight loss, diarrhea, and malaise. However, it is less clear whether his expected lifespan would be any greater. If we assume that over the preceding year his CD4+ cell count probably declined by 50\u2013100 cells/mm3, then even at that time he would have already progressed to AIDS (CD4+ cell count <200 cells/mm3). There is reasonable good cumulated evidence that starting therapy when the CD4+ cell count is very low (<200 cells/mm3) is associated with less chance of immune reconstitution and greater risk of opportunistic complications than those started on ART when the CD4+ cell count was >200 cells/mm3. The optimum CD4+ cell count for initiating ART has not been well established although recent large observational cohort studies (retrospective and prospective ) and suggests better outcomes for HIV infected patients receiving earlier ART with CD4+ cell count \u2265350 cells/mm3 or >500 cells/mm3; the data however is flawed and controversial.37, 38 Lack of randomization in these studies could result in significant biases as motivated, health-conscious individuals would likely do better that those less motivated. It is not clear in these studies as to the cause of excess mortality in those not accepting treatment. For instance, it would be expected and predictable to find excess mortality (from any disease) in marginalized people (homeless, alcoholics, drug abusers), who are less likely to start ART, which may be unrelated to HIV complications, such as suicides, homicide, accidents, drug overdose, liver failure or other diseases more prevalent in these groups (diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and cancer).",

It could be argued, however, that the FP should have been doing regular HIV serology in an individual that belongs to a high-risk group (with the patient\u2019s consent). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that nearly 50% of men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV infection are unaware of their status. The CDC National Behavior Surveillance System of high-risk venue-based recruitment found 25% of MSM tested to be infected with HIV, and nearly 50% of the HIV infected individuals were unaware of their infection.39 In New York City, the HIV incidence rate among MSM was 2.3%, with 52% of those infected being unaware of their HIV seropositivity.39 It is estimated that 21% of HIV-infected people in the US who are unaware of their infection may account for up to 52% of new infections. CDC HIV testing guidelines recommend annual testing for high-risk populations (including MSM), and since 2006 have recommended universal opt-out HIV screening in all health care settings.40 Thus, the plaintiff could argue that the defendant fell below the standard of care by not recommending and performing annual HIV tests. Furthermore, if he were found to be HIV seropositive earlier, (by 1990 or before) with careful monitoring and institution of ART before his CD4+ cell count fell <350 cells/mm3, his quality of life and life expectancy would be greater.41\n",

In the pre-HAART era CMV retinitis occurred in 30% of patients with AIDS, and the number of new cases has dramatically fallen since widespread use of HAART by 55\u201395% (average 80%).42 The incidence of CMV retinitis among patients with CD4+ cell count <100 cells/\u03bcL was 10% per year and for many patients with CD4+ cell count <50 cells/\u03bcL, it was 20% per year. Symptoms of CMV retinitis include floaters, flashing lights, loss of visual field, or visual loss. In the early stages with small peripheral retinal lesions patients can be asymptomatic and 13\u201315% of persons with CD4+ cell count \u226450 cells/\u03bcL have asymptomatic CMV retinitis.43 Lesions adjacent to the optic nerve or fovea (posterior pole of the retina or macula) are immediately vision threatening. The retina has been divided into three zones for clinical assessment of risk to vision. Zone 1 lies within 1,500 \u03bcm from the edge of the optic nerve, zone 2 extends from the edge of zone 1 to the equator of the eye, and zone 3 extends from the equator to the pars plana (pigmented posterior zone of the ciliary body). See Fig. 13.1 for the schematic diagram of the zones of the retina. Lesions of zone 1 are immediately sight-threatening and require urgent treatment, whereas lesions of zones 2\u20133 may be observed for short periods of time without risk of loss of visual acuity.42 The mean time for progression of peripheral lesions without treatment was found to be 22 days (enlargement to uninvolved retina by \u2265750 \u03bcm in width).44 The complications of untreated or delayed treatment of CMV retinitis include impaired vision to blindness, secondary to progressive retinitis with hemorrhages, scarring and retinal detachment. In the pre-HAART era, retinal detachment in CMV retinitis occurred in 25% at 6 months and in 50\u201360% at 1 year.42\n\n",

Treatment with anti-CMV agents does not eradicate the virus but delays progression and relapse, until immunity can be restored by HAART. Anti-CMV therapy, half the dose after induction for 3 weeks, can be discontinued once the CD4+ cell count is >100\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL for 6 months.

The results could be forwarded to the FP and notify him or her of the patient\u2019s cancelation plus need for counseling, close monitoring, and for initiating ART or PCP prophylaxis depending on the CD4+ cell count. If the subject has no FP, then the person can be notified of the results by letter or phone, or through the public health department. Although some physicians are reluctant to discuss confidential issues on the phone, there is no edict against this practice. However, confidentiality needs to be maintained and the identification of the person on the phone should be verified. This has become a common practice with financial institutions and even lawyers who discuss medico-legal cases with medical experts on the phone. Since the defendant knew the plaintiff had advanced HIV disease (AIDS) as indicated by the very low CD4+ cell count, it was mandatory that the patient be made aware of the seriousness of his condition as soon as possible by one of the above mechanisms. His failure to impart this information to the plaintiff directly or indirectly could be considered negligence by the court.",
