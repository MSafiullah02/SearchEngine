The arteriviral RNA is 5\u2032 capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated with two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, which encode non-structural proteins, followed by structural protein ORFs at the 3\u2032 end of the genome (Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998). Structural proteins are translated from a nested 3\u2032-coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs possessing a common leader derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome (Faaberg, 2008). An additional structural protein, E, is translated from an alternative ORF embedded within ORF2 (Wu et al., 2001).",

We hypothesized that additional ORFs are present in the PRRSV genome, whose protein products contribute to the biological properties of PRRSV. Since we were primarily interested in potential structural proteins, we screened highly purified virions for evidence of novel polypeptides. A novel 51 aa polypeptide was discovered by mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, it is encoded in an alternative reading frame of subgenomic mRNA 5 (sgmRNA5), which precedes the initiation site of the major envelope glycoprotein, GP5. The ORF, whose product is referred to here as ORF5a protein, is present as an alternative reading frame of sgmRNA5 in all PRRSV and all other arteriviruses, encoding a structurally similar putative membrane protein ranging in size from 43 to 64 aa.",

Liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) revealed the presence of peptide sequences identical to the predicted tryptic peptides of a putative 51 aa protein encoded in sgmRNA5. However, the origin of the peptide could not be ascertained, since a wide range of non-structural proteins, indicative of cellular protein contamination, were also identified. Polyethylene glycol precipitation of clarified cell-culture supernatants at 48 h after PRRSV infection, followed by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and isopycnic banding twice in caesium chloride (CsCl), resulted in the presence of a single virion population at a density of 1.22\u00b10.1 g ml\u22121 (Fig. 1a). This band possessed the peak of biological infectivity, genomic RNA, subgenomic mRNA and heteroclite RNA (Fig. 1b). The abundance of subgenomic RNA and heteroclite mRNA was 100\u20131000-fold less than for genomic RNA, indicating that PRRSV assembles predominantly one type of infectious virion containing genomic RNA. Non-structural proteins were not present in any preparation, indicating that cellular proteins not specifically associated with virions had been removed quantitatively and that the purification procedure yielded viral particles in amounts sufficient for physical characterization.",

These tryptic peptides are encoded within a 156 nt alternative reading frame of sgmRNA5, hereafter referred to as ORF5a, and strongly suggest the presence of a novel 51 aa structural polypeptide in the virion. ORF5a precedes ORF5, which encodes GP5, by 10 nt (Fig. 3). Western blotting of ultrapurified virions with anti-ORF5a protein antisera raised in goat against the recombinant protein showed the presence of ORF5a protein migrating at the same rate as in infected cell lysates (Fig. 4). The protein migrated in the acrylamide gel with an apparent mobility of approximately 10 kDa, even though its predicted molecular mass is 5926 Da. Recombinant ORF5a protein with myc and histidine tags also migrates slowly relative to its molecular mass of 9228 Da (Fig. 4b). At higher virion protein loadings, ORF5a protein appears as a doublet and a slightly higher molecular mass band is also present, suggesting that ORF5a protein may be post-translationally modified.",

Of these, peptides corresponding exactly to an alternative ORF encoding 51 aa in sgmRNA5 were present in several independently purified viral preparations. Cloning and sequencing of leader\u2013body junctions of sgmRNA showed that the VR2332 sgmRNA5 would be expected to translate to GP5 or ORF5a protein (Nelsen et al., 1999). The ORF5a protein initiator AUG codon is upstream of the consensus ORF5 AUG by 10 nt, with a second AUG representing a potential alternative ORF5a protein translation start site 11 nt downstream of the ORF5 start codon. The second AUG in the ORF5a protein is unlikely to initiate translation, since it is not conserved in PRRSV and is predicted to lie at the membrane surface (Fig. 7). Because the ORF5a protein initiator AUG appears first in sgmRNA5, ORF5a protein would be expected to be expressed at an appreciable level. The apparently low level of ORF5a protein expression suggests that ORF5, encoding GP5, is favoured as the start site of translation. The basis for this preferential expression of GP5 is not clear, since neither its initiator codon nor the two AUG sequences in ORF5b resemble the canonical Kozak sequence that typifies eukaryotic translational start sites (Kozak, 1987).",

There are two adjacent cysteine residues at positions 29 and 30, at the interior edge of the predicted transmembrane region (Fig. 7). They might allow for disulfide linkages to form in order to assist in oligomerization with other ORF5a protein monomers or with other proteins produced by the virus (Michelson, 2004; Wootton & Yoo, 2003). ORF5a protein has a highly conserved basic RQ-rich motif near the carboxyl terminus.

An amino-terminal 4 aa insertion is present in cell culture passage 80 of a highly virulent Chinese PRRSV isolate, JXA-1, that is upstream of GP5 but maintains the ORF5a protein ORF, indicating that the length of the predicted ectodomain region may not be important to ORF5a protein function (Han et al., 2009).",

The strain PL97-1, isolated in 2004, is, based on sequence similarity, most probably a field reisolate of the Ingelvac MLV vaccine. It is notable that the conserved RQ-motif of ORF5a protein is encoded by the same RNA sequence that encodes the hypervariable glycosylation-rich ectodomain region of GP5 (Fig. 3b, boxed region) (Kapur et al., 1996). Interestingly, PRRSV contains another genomic region encoding ORF3, large parts of which also encode ORF2 and ORF4 (Meng et al., 1995; Murtaugh et al., 1995). This propensity for maintaining functionally intact, overlapping ORFs for essential viral structural proteins in the presence of high levels of nucleotide sequence diversity is an exceptional feature of PRRSV.",

All of the predicted proteins contain an amino-terminal MF sequence, equivalent membrane topologies and R/Q-rich endodomain features (Fig. 7a). R and R/Q-rich motifs are involved in RNA binding that can regulate mRNA splicing and transport (Bayer et al., 2005; Tan & Frankel, 1998), suggesting a possible role for the ORF5a protein. Mutational inactivation of ORF5a in EAV severely impaired replication, showing that maintenance of intact ORF5a is important for viability (Firth et al., 2011). Thus, the ORF5a protein is not a happenstance sequence but represents a highly conserved ORF present throughout the family Arteriviridae whose function is not yet known, but may be related to efficient arteriviral RNA processing, transport or packaging.",
