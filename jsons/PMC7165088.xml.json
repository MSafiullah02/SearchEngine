This implies that they cannot make decisions in complete autonomy since they must always consult their tutor. However, on July 4, 2019 the Italian Court of Cassation specified in its sentence no. 26311/2019 that resident doctors fully answer for their own conduct, and even if a mistake occurs as a consequence of an action that they were not in the position of performing, they are directly accountable for this action.",

During her hospital stay the woman had an abortion with septic shock, resulting in severe permanent damage, because the doctor in charge \u2013 the resident doctor - was not able to adequately manage the patient.",

While it is true that they have not full autonomy, nonetheless they are not mere executors of their tutor's orders. According to the Court, if the supervising tutors delegate a medical act to junior doctors and the latter feel unable to cope with the task because of their inexperience, they must manifest their refusal. Otherwise, junior doctors shall assume full and direct responsibility for their actions and for any damage these actions may inflict on the patient.",

It presents them with a choice whenever they are charged with a task: they stand at a crossroads between following their tutors' orders or disobeying them because they are scared at the prospect of making a mistake and, as a consequence, being involved in medico-legal disputes. Asking resident doctors to assess on a case-by-case basis their ability to handle certain clinical situations means recognizing them as doctors who have professional autonomy. Therefore, this acknowledgment inevitably \u201cneutralises\u201d the dichotomy \u201cmedical doctor/student\u201d.",

Working at a steady pace and experiencing episodes of workplace bullying are, for example, a few of the sources of stress for junior doctors.
