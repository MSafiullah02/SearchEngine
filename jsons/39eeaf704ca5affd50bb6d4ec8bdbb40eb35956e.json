The genomic RNA is a message for production of four nonstructural proteins which are translated in the cytoplasm of the infected cell as two polyproteins, P123 (1896 amino acids) and P1234 (2513 amino acids, produced by readthrough of an opal termination codon at position 1897). The P1234 polyprotein is processed by the nsP2 proteinase through a series of cleavage intermediates into the four final products nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4, named in order 5 0 to 3 0 along the genome. Since cytoplasmic, nonorganelle-bound proteinases are rare in animal cells, a virally encoded activity was predicted as early as 1981 [1] . The proteinase was localized to the C-terminal half of nsP2 by translation in vitro of RNA transcribed from deleted or truncated full-length cDNA clones of Sindbis virus. Deletions within nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 did not affect proteolysis, but deletions in the C-terminal half of nsP2 abolished proteinase activity, and deletions in the N-terminal half of nsP2 led to aberrant processing [2, 3] . At the same time, several mutations that rendered the proteinase temperature sensitive were found to lie in the C-terminal half of nsP2 [4] . Site-specific mutagenesis of Cys and His residues in this domain that are conserved among alphaviruses later showed that Cys481 and His558 are essential for proteolytic activity, and it was proposed that these constitute the catalytic dyad of a cysteine proteinase [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 777, "end": 780, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1170, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1173, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1315, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1586, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Name and History"}, {"text": "The only known substrates for the Sindbis nsP2 proteinase are the Sindbis non-structural polyproteins (P123 and P1234) and their cleavage intermediates (which include P12, P23 and P34). The consensus cleavage site is (Ala/ Ile/Val/Ser)-Gly-(Ala/Xaa)k(Ala/Tyr). Mutational studies have demonstrated that the invariant Gly in the P2 position is essential for efficient cleavage; changing this Gly to Ala led to substantially slower cleavage of the mutated site, and substitution with Val or Glu rendered the site completely uncleavable [6] . Similarly, an Ala or Gly was found to be essential in the P1 position for efficient cleavage in Sindbis virus (Cys was not tested) [7] . The enzyme is relatively insensitive to the identity of the residue in the P1 0 position, however [7] . It is thought that additional determinants of specificity must exist, since these are the only sites cleaved by the enzyme. In this regard it has been shown that different polyproteins containing the nsP2 proteinase differ in their preferences for the three cleavage sites, suggesting that cleavage-site recognition involves more extensive interactions than the simple recognition of a short linear sequence by the enzyme [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 534, "end": 537, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 671, "end": 674, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 775, "end": 778, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1206, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Activity and Specificity"}, {"text": "Sindbis nsP2 is a polypeptide of 807 amino acids encoded by nucleotides 1680\u00c04100 of the genome.

Both Cys481 and His558, the putative catalytic dyad, are followed by tryptophan residues, and Trp559 has been shown to be essential for proteolysis. These two aromatic residues may interact (stack) to maintain proper conformation of the catalytic pocket [5] . Substitution of Asn614 by Asp enhances cleavage; an Asn residue has been shown previously to be associated with the catalytic pocket in papain [8] . Mutations Phe509Leu, Ala517Thr, Asp522Asn and Gly748Ser have been shown to render the proteinase temperature sensitive in vivo; these mutations are believed to alter the structure of the protein [9] .

The activities of the enzyme have been studied both in vitro (referenced above) and in infected or transfected cells [6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15] . In many of these studies, site-directed mutagenesis was used to destroy cleavage sites or to inactivate the proteinase. These studies have shown that P1234 can cleave itself autoproteolytically in cis to give P123 and nsP4, whereas P123 can be cleaved only in trans. Cleavage of P123 by another P123 molecule or by P12 produces nsP1 and P23, whereas cleavage by P23 produces predominantly P12 and nsP3. Finally, enzymes that lack nsP3 (that is, nsP2 or P12) cannot cleave the nsP3/nsP4 site. These preferences lead to a temporal regulation of RNA synthesis during the infection cycle. Early in infection P123 and nsP4 are produced, and together with host factors these form a replicase complex that synthesizes negative-strand RNA. Cleavage of P123 in the replicase complex produces a replicase that synthesizes positive-strand RNAs very efficiently, but cannot make negative strands [14, 15] . As the concentration of trans-acting proteinases builds up, the non-structural polyprotein is cleaved while nascent at the nsP2/nsP3 site, and the products produced are nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and P34. Negative-strand RNA synthesis is then shut off, because the cleaved products cannot form a negativestrand replicase.
