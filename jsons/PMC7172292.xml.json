This mutation contributes to escape from the NP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.6, 7, 8 In fact, among the Oct 2017-Apr 2018 UK influenza A/H3N2 sequences available in influenza sequence databases (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data-GISAID: https://www.gisaid.org/), 462/500 had already acquired the V197I NP mutation compared to just 46/455 in 2016/2017.
