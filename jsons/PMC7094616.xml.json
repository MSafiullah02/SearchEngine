One of the arms of the host defensive response is the activation of the so called acute phase response (APR) that includes the production of inflammatory cytokines and a number of proteins such as c-reactive proteins (CRPs), serum amyloid proteins (SAA, SAP) and pentraxins (PTX). Those are collectively termed acute phase proteins (APP). APP are present in all animal groups studied, from arthropods to vertebrates [1,2]. Nonetheless, most of the research on APP has been conducted on mammalian models.",

The differential modulation of CRP, PTX and SAP upon microbial challenge makes those proteins ideal markers for disease prognosis and discrimination between bacterial and viral etiology. Furthermore, changes in APP expression after the administration of antiviral drugs and vaccines have been observed, suggesting the possible use of APP as reporters of the efficacy of antiviral treatments.",

Increased APP concentrations in serum of organisms infected with viruses causing respiratory illness can reach the hundreds-thousand-fold over healthy samples [27]. Increased levels of CRP have been found in patients infected with the most virulent types of influenza A virus. Thus, human influenza disease outcome has been associated with enhanced production of CRP, with the highest CRP levels correlating with the more severe symptoms and even mortality [20,21,24]. CRP induction may vary amongst different avian influenza A virus subtypes: H7N9 is a more powerful inductor of CRP and cytokine production than the H1N1 subtype [23]. In fact, the highly pathogenic influenza A H7N9 subtype induces high serum levels of CRP that are associated with a fatal clinical outcome [22].",

Such extrahepatic upregulation of SAA has also been reported in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected pig, particularly in the lungs [35]. Infection with pandemic influenza viruses causes increased levels of SAA in other non-human hosts [26]. SAA plays a part in the host response to equine influenza, with SAA concentrations peaking during the acute phase of the disease [34], in good correlation with the appearance of clinical signs. This observation can be applied to veterinary practice where elevated concentrations of SAA may serve as a marker of respiratory viral infection in cattle [36,37].",

Thus, it is not surprising that patients undergoing chronic hepatitis C infection showed higher levels of CRPs than healthy individuals [40]. Similarly, high levels of CRP have been reported in chronic hepatitis B patients in association to liver damage [38,39]. In fact, CRP is considered to be a useful predictor of mortality in hepatitis B infected individuals suffering from cirrhosis [61].

Two important viruses affecting fish farming, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) have been shown to alter crp gene expression in zebrafish where significant up-regulation of mRNA expression of crp gene isoforms has been observed in zebrafish 2 days after infection with VHSV and SVCV [55]. In parallel, the transcriptional activation of crp gene promoters by histone methylation was shown to increase from day 1 to day 5 post-infection with SVCV [69]. At the protein level, proteomic analysis of blood from SVCV-infected zebrafish revealed a peak of isoforms crp2 and crp5 expression at 24 hpi, returning rapidly to basal levels [55]. A similar response has been observed in carp infected with the herpesvirus CyHV, with a peak of serum concentrations of CRP already at 24 hpi that declined after day 5 [70].",

That is the case of the influenza virus vaccine where CRP response to vaccination is normally weak [77]. Nevertheless, a number of studies have explored the potential of measuring the changes in APP levels to assess the protective efficacy of a given vaccine. On this respect, it is important to note that the correlation between CRP levels and the efficacy of the vaccine may vary depending on host conditions, particularly age. Elder patients respond to herpes zoster vaccination with lower levels of CRP, which has been taken as an indication of vaccine failure [74]. A similar age-dependent behavior occurs in HIV-infected patients where inflammatory markers correlation with mortality is different among infants and adults [44]. Serum concentrations of CRP during HIV infection can be associated with viral loads and therefore with the efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine [78]. A similar situation is observed in non-human species: the CRP response of mice to influenza virus vaccination is also affected by age, with neonatal mice showing higher CRP levels than adult individuals [25].",

In fact, some adjuvant formulations by their own can lead to a rapid increase of CRP levels (that later return to basal levels) after injection, which is considered a sign of acute inflammation caused by vaccination [75]. Similar situations have been reported in veterinary preventive care studies. A commercial vaccine against two viral diseases of dogs (Nobivac\u00ae) induced only a 2-fold increase in serum levels of CRP [73] that went in parallel to increasing antibody titers against canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus. The work of Romiszewski and colleagues suggested that CRP profiles could be a reliable measure of the efficacy of vaccines for dogs.",

Human PTX3 and SAP binding to influenza virus inhibits virus-induced hemagglutination [30]. Interestingly, PTX3 and SAP can bind to virus-infected cells but not to uninfected cells, which suggest a selective effect of PTX and SAP during viral infection [28]. By analyzing influenza A virus mutants resistant to the inhibitory effect of PTX3, the amino acid residues in the hemagglutinin (HA) responsible of the virus sensitivity to PTX3 were identified [31], providing further evidence of the recognition of HA by PTX3 in mice. Treatment of influenza virus-infected mice with human PTX3 has been successful in reducing viral loads and increasing survival on the infected animals [30], hinting the potential therapeutic application of pentraxins. In recent years the use of recombinant PTX as antiviral drugs has emerged as a distinct possibility. On this respect, Han and colleagues demonstrated the protective effect of intranasal administration of recombinant PTX3 against murine coronavirus [42]. In the aforementioned study the gene knockout technology was applied to the investigation of the antiviral response of pentraxins, showing higher susceptibility to mouse hepatitis coronavirus MHV in PTX3-deficient mice [42]. Moreover, the observation that PTX3 could bind MHV particles in vitro prompted an in vivo study where mice were treated with recombinant PTX3, achieving a better clearance of the virus in the lung.",

A follow up study corroborated that SAA protected cells from HCV infection, blocking a step prior to virus entry into the cell [82]. It is worth to mention that the binding of APP to the virus particle does not always end up with the inhibition of viral replication. On the contrary, PTX3 binding to Ross River virus seems to facilitate virus entry into the cell [14]. Another instance of a \u201cpro-viral\u201d action of APP, porcine SAA has been reported to have an enhancing effect on PRRSV replication in vitro [35]. Why pentraxins can both inhibit and enhance viral replication is not fully understood. While the in vitro antiviral effects of pentraxins are often related to their virus binding capacity, the in vivo effect of APP on viral infectivity is usually mediated by the activation if the innate immune system and interferon pathways [83].

Particularly, measurements of serum CRP levels have been recommended to distinguish between bacterial and viral diseases [94,95] in those pathologies resulting in febrile condition in children [96]. Immunoassay tests for myxovirus A (MxA) and CRP were the bases of a clinical diagnostic protocol to determine the bacterial or viral etiology of acute respiratory infections [97]. Higher blood levels of CRP can be used to differentiate between bacterial and viral gastrointestinal infection [98,99] and therefore avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Combined high levels of both CRP and SAA are indicative of bacterial infection in cases on infectious mononucleosis, while elevated SAA (only) points to a viral infection [100]. In addition to the identification of a bacterial or viral origin of a disease the determination of CRP concentrations has been shown to distinguish between viral (dengue) and protozoan (malaria)-infected patients with very similar clinical signs [101].",

SAA and CRP concentrations are elevated in cats receiving interferon therapy against feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus. In that model SAA/CRP levels can be taken as evidence of the innate immune system being activated by the antiviral treatment [103]. In mice, on the other hand, lower levels of SAA in serum are associated with the inhibition of influenza virus replication in oseltamivir-treated individuals [27].",
