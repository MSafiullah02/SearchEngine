It is assembled and stored in the lamellar bodies, which are concentric or parallel lamellae of phospholipid bilayers. Lamellar bodies are extruded into the fluid layer lining the alveoli by exocytosis and form long stacked tubes composed mainly of phospholipid bilayers called tubular myelin. On cross section, tubular myelin has a lattice-like structure because the corners of the component tubes appear fused. Tubular myelin enters the air\u2013water interface quickly by adsorption and greatly reduces the surface tension of that interface (Hallman 2004). It is the major source of the monolayer surface film lining the air\u2013liquid interface in the alveoli. In this monolayer the hydrophobic fatty acyl groups of the phospholipids extend into the air, while the hydrophilic polar head groups bind water (Possmayer et al. 1984).\n\n",

However, the total surfactant pool size is not equivalent to the amount of active surfactant. Maintaining an adequate intra-alveolar surfactant pool is essential for lung function and is dependent on the dynamic cycle of surfactant metabolism (Nkadi et al. 2009). Surfactant pool size increases in late pregnancy, followed by a gradual decrease after birth to adult values (Zimmermann et al. 2005). During and shortly after birth, large amounts of surfactant are released into the alveolar space (Zimmermann et al. 2005). Among different species, humans have the smallest alveolar pool sizes, whereas the amount of saturated phosphatidyl choline in lung tissue is similar across species. The lower alveolar surfactant pool size makes the human lung particularly vulnerable to surfactant dysfunction in case of lung injury. The surfactant pool size in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is around 10 mg/kg or less, while healthy term infants have an estimated surfactant pool size of 100 mg/kg (Nkadi et al. 2009). The rate of synthesis of surfactant in preterm infants is also low (Zimmermann et al. 2005).",

Type II cells have beta-adrenergic receptors and respond to beta-agonists with increased surfactant secretion (Nkadi et al. 2009). Purines, such as adenosine triphosphate are potent stimulators of surfactant secretion and may be important for its secretion at birth. Mechanical stretch, such as lung distension and hyperventilation, has also been found to be involved in stimulating surfactant secretion (Nkadi et al. 2009). Hormones also play a role in surfactant secretion. Thyroxine accelerates type II cell differentiation while acting synergistically with glucocorticoids to enhance lung compliance and DPPC synthesis. Finally, both prenatally administered maternal glucocorticoids and exogenous surfactant administration after birth stimulate endogenous surfactant synthesis.",

SP-B promotes phospholipid adsorption and induces the insertion of phospholipids into the monolayer, thus enhancing the formation of a stable surface film (Creuwels et al. 1997). SP-C enhances phospholipid adsorption, stimulates the insertion of phospholipids out of the subphase into the air\u2013liquid interface, and may increase the resistance of surfactant to inhibition by serum proteins or by edema fluid (Creuwels et al. 1997; Griese 1999).",

In vitro studies (Moses et al. 1991; Clark et al. 1987) and animal studies (Sun et al. 1993; Davey et al. 1993) have demonstrated that meconium inhibits surfactant function and is likely to be partially responsible for alveolar collapse in meconium aspiration syndrome. Components of meconium that may contribute to altered surfactant function include cholesterol, free fatty acids, bile salts, bilirubin, and proteolytic enzymes (Moses et al. 1991; Clark et al. 1987; Sun et al. 1993; Lieberman 1966). In particular, phospholipase-A2 (PLA2) in meconium has been found to inhibit the activity of surfactant in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, through the competitive displacement of surfactant from the alveolar film (Nkadi et al. 2009). PLA2 is also known to induce hydrolysis of DPPC, releasing free fatty acids and lyso-PC which damage the alveolar\u2013capillary membrane and induce intrapulmonary sequestration of neutrophils (Nkadi et al. 2009).",

ALI/ARDS is characterized by sudden onset, impaired gas exchange, decreased static compliance, and a non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema (Nkadi et al. 2009). ARDS is characterized by an increase in the permeability of the alveolar\u2013capillary barrier due to injury to the endothelium and/or alveolar lining cells. Damage to the alveolar type I cells leads to an influx of protein-rich edema fluid into the alveoli, as well as decreased fluid clearance from the alveolar space. Neutrophils are attracted into the airways by host bacterial and chemotactic factors and express enzymes and cytokines which further damage the alveolar epithelial cells (Nkadi et al. 2009). Type II epithelial cell injury leads to a decrease in surfactant production, with resultant alveolar collapse.",

If the distribution is not proportionate to the number of saccules beyond each branch point, surfactant distribution will not be uniform. Any nonuniformity at a proximal branch point will be amplified at subsequent branch points. When exogenous surfactant is administered in clinical practice, its distribution is not ideal, but is often good enough because of the biophysical properties of surfactant and the small amount that is needed regionally in the lung for a treatment response (Jobe 2006).",

A randomized trial demonstrated that prophylaxis may be administered in small aliquots soon after resuscitation and confirmation of endotracheal tube position, with equivalent or greater efficacy (Kendig et al. 1998).

Also, in these trials, surfactant in the \u201crescue\u201d group was given relatively late, between 1.5 and 7.4 h, after birth. There are no trials comparing the effects of prophylactic intubation and surfactant administration shortly after birth to infants at high risk of RDS (with intubation primarily performed to administer surfactant) to very early selective administration (e.g., at 30\u201360 min of life) in intubated infants with early RDS or respiratory insufficiency. Therefore, in current practice, the benefits of prophylactic surfactant demonstrated in these trials might not be as large. A strategy of surfactant prophylaxis subjects infants without RDS to unnecessary intubation and surfactant administration and also to the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (Clark et al. 2001) (although admittedly some of these infants without RDS may still require intubation and ventilation for respiratory failure not due to RDS). In recent years, prophylactic surfactant administration to preterm infants at risk of RDS has been compared with the use of nasal CPAP (and attempting to avoid mechanical ventilation) as the primary method of respiratory management at birth. These studies are discussed in the next section.",

This approach can avoid unnecessary intubation, unnecessary surfactant administration, and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, while reducing healthcare costs and resource utilization. However, clinicians should closely monitor infants initially stabilized on CPAP to identify infants who have progressive respiratory failure, so that infants who require surfactant can be intubated and given surfactant as early as possible. Clinicians should also use information available prior to the birth of the infant to identify infants who are not likely to do well with initial stabilization on nasal CPAP, such as infants born to mothers who have not received antenatal glucocorticoids.",

            "text": "When a preterm infant has respiratory distress syndrome that is initially managed with CPAP or with supplemental oxygen through a hood, is it better to intubate him early, administer surfactant and extubate within an hour after brief mechanical ventilation, or to wait and see if the infant develops significant respiratory insufficiency, and if he does, only then intubate, give surfactant, and wean him off the ventilator gradually? Six randomized controlled clinical trials addressed this question and are summarized in a systematic review (Stevens Timothy et al. 2007). The rapid (within one hour) extubation attempted in these trials contrasts with the traditional approach \u2013 developed when surfactant therapy was first used \u2013 of keeping an infant on mechanical ventilation after surfactant administration, weaning ventilator support gradually as the pulmonary status improved, and extubating the infant from low ventilator settings. This approach of rapid extubation followed immediately by the use of nasal CPAP has been called \u201cINSURE\u201d (INtubate, SURfactant, Extubate to CPAP) and is intended to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury than can result from even brief periods of mechanical ventilation (Donn and Sinha 2006; Schmolzer et al. 2008). The six randomized trials, all of which are trials of \u201crescue\u201d surfactant administration, are summarized in a systematic review (Stevens Timothy et al. 2007). Most of these studies included infants with a gestation of 35 weeks and below and a birth weight of 2,500 g and below. Many of the infants in these studies were between 32 and 35 weeks (few were extremely premature). In these studies of infants with signs and symptoms of RDS, intubation and early surfactant therapy followed by extubation to nasal CPAP (NCPAP) compared with later selective surfactant administration was associated with a lower incidence of mechanical ventilation (typical RR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.57\u20130.79; typical ARD \u22120.19, 95 % CI \u22120.26 to \u22120.11), air leak syndromes (typical RR 0.52, 95 % CI 0.28\u20130.96; typical ARD \u22120.04, 95 % CI \u22120.08 to 0.00), and BPD (typical RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.26\u20130.99; typical ARD \u22120.08, 95 % CI \u22120.15 to \u22120.01). A larger proportion of infants in the early surfactant group received surfactant than in the selective surfactant group (typical RR 1.62, 95 % CI 1.41\u20131.86; typical ARD 0.38, 95 % CI 0.30\u20130.47). The number of surfactant doses per patient was significantly greater among patients randomized to the early surfactant group (WMD 0.57 doses per patient, 95 % CI 0.44\u20130.69). In stratified analysis by FiO2 at study entry, a lower threshold for treatment (FiO2 \u2264 0.45) resulted in lower incidence of air leak (typical RR 0.46 and 95 % CI 0.23\u20130.93; typical ARD \u22120.05, 95 % CI \u22120.10 to \u22120.01) and BPD (typical RR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.20\u20130.92; typical ARD \u22120.10, 95 % CI \u22120.19 to \u22120.02). A higher treatment threshold (FiO2 > 0.45) at study entry was associated with a higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment (typical RR 2.15, 95 % CI 1.09\u20134.13; typical ARD 0.12, 95 % CI 0.02\u20130.21). In another recent randomized trial (Rojas et al. 2009), infants 27\u201331 weeks gestation with RDS who were randomly assigned within the first hour of life either to intubation, very early surfactant, extubation, and nasal continuous positive airway pressure required less ventilation and had a lower incidence of mortality and air leaks (pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema) than infants assigned to nasal continuous airway pressure alone. These data suggest that for a preterm infant with RDS who is not on mechanical ventilation (and is being managed on CPAP or an oxygen hood), early intubation at a low FiO2 threshold (FiO2 < 0.45), surfactant administration, and rapid extubation to CPAP decreases the risk of needing mechanical ventilation, BPD, and air leak syndrome, although it results in more surfactant use. Whether the same INSURE approach should be followed when prophylactic surfactant therapy is used is not clear due to lack of evidence.",

Therefore preterm infants who do not receive prophylactic surfactant and subsequently develop clinical features of RDS should receive the first dose of surfactant as early as possible. Outborn infants are at highest risk of delayed administration. Tertiary referral units accepting outborn infants should attempt to develop systems to ensure that surfactant is administered as early as possible to these infants, either by the transporting team or, if appropriate, by the referring hospital. In inborn infants, delays in administration of surfactant occur if other admission procedures such as line placement, radiographs, and nursing procedures are allowed to take precedence over surfactant dosing soon after birth. Surfactant administration should be given priority over such admission procedures.",

Administering repeat doses of surfactant can overcome such inactivation. The results of two randomized controlled trials that compared multiple dosing regimens to single-dose regimens of animal-derived surfactant extract for treatment of established respiratory distress syndrome (Dunn et al. 1990; Speer et al. 1992) have been evaluated in a systematic review (Soll and \u00d6zek 2009). In one study (Dunn et al. 1990), after the initial dose of bovine lipid extract surfactant, infants assigned to the multiple-dose group could receive up to three additional doses during the first 72 h of life if they had a respiratory deterioration, provided they had shown a positive response to the first dose and a pneumothorax had been eliminated as the cause of the respiratory deterioration. In the other study (Speer et al. 1992), infants in the multiple-dose group received additional doses of poractant at 12 and 24 h after the initial dose if they still needed supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Approximately 70 % of the infants randomized to the multiple-dose regimen received multiple doses.",

Again, there were minor short-term benefits to using a low threshold with no differences in major clinical outcomes. However, in a subgroup of infants with respiratory distress syndrome complicated by perinatal compromise or infection, infants in the high-threshold group had a trend towards higher mortality than the low-threshold group. Based on current evidence, it appears appropriate to use persistent or worsening signs of respiratory distress syndrome as criteria for retreatment with surfactant.

In a second report (Bloom et al. 2005) that included two separate trials \u2013 a prophylaxis trial and a treatment trial \u2013 the trials were halted prematurely due to recruitment problems and hence had inconclusive results with no demonstrated differences in outcomes between the two products.

The dose of beractant was uniformly 100 mg/kg across all five studies. When only studies that used a 100 mg/kg dose of poractant were considered, the reduction in mortality was not statistically significant (typical RR 0.82, 95 % CI 0.44\u20131.58), emphasizing the fact that the most significant effect on mortality was seen with a 200 mg/kg dose of poractant (typical RR 0.29, 95 % CI 0.10\u20130.79). Two of these five studies (Speer et al. 1995; Ramanathan et al. 2004) also reported more rapid improvement in oxygenation with poractant compared to beractant. The difference in outcomes described above between poractant and beractant may well be related to the dose of phospholipids and not to other characteristics of the products.

One study (Horbar et al. 1990) reported an increase in the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and a case report documents a temporal association between the development of intraventricular hemorrhage and the administration of surfactant-TA to improve respiratory failure caused by pulmonary hemorrhage (Funato et al. 1992). However, the meta-analyses of multiple trials do not show an increase in the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage with surfactant therapy compared to placebo (Seger and Soll 2009; Soll 1998; Soll and \u00d6zek 1997, 2010).",

            "text": "There is well-described increase in the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage with surfactant therapy (Raju and Langenberg 1993; Tomaszewska et al. 1999). Although trials in which animal-derived surfactants were used reported a higher incidence (5\u20136 %) of pulmonary hemorrhage than trials of protein-free synthetic surfactant (1\u20133 %), direct comparison demonstrates no difference in the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. The overall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was low and the absolute magnitude of the increased risk is small (Raju and Langenberg 1993). However, moderate and severe pulmonary hemorrhage is associated with an increased risk of death and short-term morbidity. It is not associated with increased long-term morbidity (Pandit et al. 1999).The occurrence of pulmonary hemorrhage may be related to the presence of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (Garland et al. 1994). Seppanen et al. studied the association of neonatal complications with the Doppler-derived aortopulmonary pressure gradient (APPG) across the ductus arteriosus, which reflects pulmonary artery pressure during the first day of life. Infants in whom the APPG decreased after birth had a lower frequency of patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary hemorrhage than those whose APPG remained low (Seppanen et al. 1995). Another mechanism for the pulmonary hemorrhage may be a direct cytotoxicity, which has been demonstrated in in vitro studies and appears to be different for different surfactants and different dosages (Findlay et al. 1995).",

Two studies did not find antibodies specific to surfactant protein in the sera of preterm infants treated with bovine surfactant (Bartmann et al. 1992; Whitsett et al. 1991). In other studies, immune complexes or antibodies to the protein in exogenous porcine, bovine, or human surfactant have been identified in the sera of neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. However similar immune complexes or antibodies were also noted in control infants who did not receive surfactant, and no significant differences were noted between surfactant-treated and control infants (Chida et al. 1991; Strayer et al. 1989; Robertson et al. 1992). The presence of antibodies in control infants may be the result of leakage of surfactant proteins into the circulation (Chida et al. 1991).",

There are no randomized trials of exogenous surfactant therapy specifically for ARDS in neonates, but in older children with acute respiratory failure, surfactant use decreased mortality and duration of ventilation (Willson et al. 1999; Duffett et al. 2007). Because of this, and based on the pathophysiologic, clinical, and radiologic similarities between RDS and ARDS, it is reasonable to provide exogenous surfactant therapy to term infants with clinical and radiologic features of ARDS (severe respiratory failure with pulmonary opacification and air bronchograms on chest radiographs). The use of surfactant in ARDS is discussed in detail in Sect. 28.2.",

A new class of protein-containing synthetic surfactants is being tested for efficacy and might prove to have an important role in exogenous surfactant therapy in the future.While prophylactic surfactant administration to preterm infants at risk of RDS was previously the preferred practice compared to \u201crescue\u201d surfactant administration, emerging new evidence suggests that initial stabilization of preterm infants on nasal continuous positive airway pressure might be equally effective, requires fewer resources, and avoids ventilator-induced lung injury.Exogenous surfactant therapy has potential benefits in term infants with meconium aspiration syndrome.\n",

The composition of lung surfactant is critical to lung function, and the subcellular lamellar body of the type II alveolar cell has a major role in maintaining the composition of surfactant. The distribution of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A3 (ABCA3) is shown in red. It is possible that ABCA3 targets surfactant-containing vesicles to the lamellar bodies. The lamellar body is formed through the fusion of several multivesicular bodies, and its lipid bilayers are converted to tubular myelin as they are turned out into the alveolar space. Surfactant protein A, secreted primarily by a constitutive pathway that does not involve the lamellar body, is required for the formation of tubular myelin. Surfactant aggregate, such as tubular myelin, is the precursor of surfactant at the air\u2013water interface (inset). Cationic transmembrane proteins (surfactant protein B or surfactant protein C or both (not depicted in the monolayer\u2013multilayer film)) together with anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylinositol or both (green)) facilitate the entry of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholines (blue) into the monolayer at the interface, maintaining a low surface tension. During tidal breathing, tubular myelin surfactant is converted to smaller aggregates that are taken up by type II cells and alveolar macrophages. Arrows depict the direction of surfactant flux",
