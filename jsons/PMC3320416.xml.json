In brief, he assumed a uniform distribution of all possible incubation periods derived from these contact dates for each patient and randomly selected an incubation period from all contact dates for each patient to obtain a distribution of the incubation period for all 19 patients. The process is repeated 10,000 times to obtain an overall frequency distribution of the incubation period.",

When a uniform distribution is assumed for all possible incubation periods, the expected frequency for a day x as the incubation period is either 0 or 1/(total number of possible days). Taking the first patient (Canada 1) in (1) as an example, the expected frequency for 1, 2, 3, . . . , 18 days is 0, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 1/11, 0, 0, . . . , 0.
