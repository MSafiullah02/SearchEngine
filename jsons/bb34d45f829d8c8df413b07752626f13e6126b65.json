Podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells play critical roles in urine filtration, reabsorption and excretion. Notably, podocytes are particularly vulnerable to viral and bacterial attacks, and podocyte injury easily induces heavy proteinuria [5] . As recent research data showed, 43.9% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, especially those with AKI, had proteinuria [6] . Moreover, a recent study reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urine samples of patients with severe COVID-19 [3] . Furthermore, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the systemic circulation is also a key process that leads to AKI. According to published data, the length of time between the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples and AKI occurrence was approximately 7 days [1] .",
