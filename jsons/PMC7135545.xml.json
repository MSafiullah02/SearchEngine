Other reasons include overcrowding, poor nutrition, and inadequate health care, which are common among the socially marginalized. Migrants are a particularly vulnerable population. Not surprisingly, morbidity and mortality rates for HIV and TB are several times higher among migrants and in the northern border states of Mexico than in this country as a whole.

First, knowledge gets translated into new and better technologies, such as vaccines and drugs. This method is the best-understood mechanism through which it improves health. But knowledge is also internalized by individuals who use it to structure their everyday behavior in key domains, such as personal hygiene, feeding habits, sexuality, and child-rearing practices.
