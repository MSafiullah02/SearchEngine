This was a retrospective cohort study in preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g. Each BCV catheter was matched 1:3 with ECCs according to sex, birth weight, and year of insertion. The main outcome was the CLABSI density rate per 1000 days. Secondary outcomes included CLABSI episodes, CLABSI episodes per infant, and CLABSI/death. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether the type of catheter (ECC vs. BCV) was associated with CLABSI risk. Ninety-six catheters (21 BCVs and 75 ECCs) in 79 infants were included (993 catheter days). BCV catheters were associated with a reduced CLABSI density rate compared to ECCs (3.05/1000 days vs 21.1/1000 days; p < 0.001). ECCs were associated with increased CLABSI risk compared to BCV catheters in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 36; (95% CI, 2.5-511); p = 0.008).",

In general, UVCs are withdrawn electively as soon as possible after the 4th day of life (DOL) and always before the 10th DOL and substituted by an ECC or a peripheral cannula depending on the patient's clinical condition and the ongoing need for a CVC. ECCs are inserted through forearm veins without US guidance under sterile conditions and advanced to the distal third portion of the superior vena cava (SVC). CVC tip position is checked by a chest X-ray. A noncentral catheter tip position at the intrathoracic subclavian or brachiocephalic vein is sometimes accepted. During the study period, bilumen 2 French polyurethane ECC lines (Nutriline Twinflow\u00ae, Vygon; Aachen, Germany) were used. Non-pharmacological sedation methods (contention) and 24% sucrose solution are routinely used. Only neonatal nurses are qualified to place ECCs. Neonatal nurses work full time in the neonatal unit.

Indications include severe hemodynamic instability (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, septic shock), high-risk surgery (e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) surgery or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation), the need for multiple drug infusions, or exhausted peripheral veins. From 2014, we implemented in-plane US-guided supraclavicular BCV cannulation as the technique of choice for critically infants and neonates under 5 kg. In this study, all procedures were performed by a pediatrician with 10 years of experience in US-guided CVC placement in children (including more than 150 procedures using the supraclavicular BCV approach). A portable US machine (Sonosite Turbo, Fujifilm Japan) equipped with a linear 6-13-MHz transducer (L25x linear probe) was used. Prior to the procedure, the left and right BCV diameters were assessed. The optimal catheter size was selected by keeping a catheter:vein ratio of \u2264 1:3 to prevent blood flow obstruction and thrombosis [7, 8] . Doublelumen 3-and 4-French short (5-6 cm), noncoated catheters were used in all instances (Multicath 2\u00ae, Vygon; Aachen, Germany and Standard Unimpregnated CVC, Cookmedical; Bloomington, IN, USA) depending on the size of the vein. All procedures were performed using the conventional Seldinger technique under sterile conditions and pharmacological sedation. Nonintubated preterms were sedated with midazolam (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.5-1 mg/kg) while fentanyl (1 mcg/kg) was used in infants under invasive mechanical ventilation. Mepivacaine 2% was used for local anesthesia of the skin (maximal dose 5 mg). The cannulation side that provided a better long-axis view of the BCV was selected, and the patient was positioned with the neck extended and rotated 45\u00b0opposite to that side. For patients under mechanical ventilation, the ventilator settings were not manipulated during cannulation. The linear transducer was positioned in the supraclavicular area to obtain a long-axis view of the BCVand subclavian vein. The subclavian artery and the underlying lung pleura were identified before puncture. A 22-gauge echogenic introducer needle attached to a syringe was used to puncture the vein. The needle was inserted in plane from the lateral aspect of the transducer and directed under real-time visualization to the BCV. Blood was aspirated to confirm intravascular positioning, and a straight soft-tipped 0.018-in. guidewire was advanced into the vessel and checked by US visualization. The CVC tip was navigated and adequacy of tip position was assessed by real-time cardiac and vascular US using a predefined protocol [9] . A noncentral catheter tip position was not allowed. The procedure was completed as usual and the catheter was fixed using 5-0 non-absorbable surgical suture.",

The chi-square test was employed for comparisons of categorical variables; nonparametric tests (the Mann-Whitney U test) were used for comparisons of continuous variables. The occurrence of CLABSI was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator and log-rank test. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether CVC type (ECC vs BCV) is an independent risk factor for CLABSI. Potential risk factors for CLABSI with p < 0.1 as the entry criterion were selected by the step-forward method for the multivariate model, with the aim of controlling confounders. Assuming that infants have the same chance to receive either CVC type (BCV or ECC) and a matched design with an exposed:unexposed ratio of 1:3, a sample size of 20 BCV (and 60 ECCs) will provide a power of 0.8 (alpha error 0.05) to detect a 3-fold decrease in the CLABSI density rate. With a planned insertion of 5 BCV catheters/year, we chose a time window of 4 years to extract data from our cohort to convey with our sample size calculation. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The SPSS (IBM Corp., Arkmonk, N.Y., USA) statistical package version 22 was used.",

Another 38 VLBW infants were initially assessed for eligibility during the study period but excluded for several reasons (Fig. 1) . In one infant, BCV cannulation failed, and an internal jugular vein catheter was inserted; he was also prospectively excluded. All patients received a UVC for a median of 8 days [6] [7] [8] before ECC or BCV insertion. Preterm infants in whom US-guided BCV catheters were inserted had a lower gestational age and suffered from more morbidities (mechanical ventilation days, Table 2 . Compared to ECC insertion, the first-attempt success rate of US-guided BCV cannulation was higher (80.9% vs 42.6%; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2) , and the number of punctured veins ((1 [1] vs 2 [1] [2] [3] ; p = 0.006) and puncture attempts (1 [1] vs 2 [1] [2] [3] ; p < 0.001) were lower. Accidental arterial punctures and/or pneumothorax were not observed. BCV catheters were inserted later in postnatal life than were ECCs, but the infant's weight at the time of insertion was similar. Indications for CVCs differed between the study groups: ECCs were used mostly for routine care (maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and parenteral nutrition), whereas BCVs were inserted in cases of high-risk surgery (laparotomy for NEC in 6 infants and gastric volvulus in one infant), hemodynamic instability requiring inotropics and invasive monitoring (PDA postligation syndrome in 4 infants and septic shock in 2 infants), and vein exhaustion (6 infants). Most BCVs were electively withdrawn after completion of treatment; CLABSI and catheter dysfunction were frequent reasons for nonelective removal of ECCs. The indwelling time of BCV catheters was significantly longer than that of PICCs [15 (13-18) days vs. 8 (6-11) days; p < 0.001).",

The risk of CLABSI is greater in preterm infants than in older infants, children, and adults due to the unique vulnerability of immature infants, their prolonged CVC dwell times, and their high-intensity critical care needs [17] . Major efforts have been made to control risk factors and reduce the CLABSI-associated burden [18] [19] [20] . One aspect that might influence the CLABSI rate is the type of CVC and the insertion technique [1, 21] . In this observational study, we found a significantly lower rate of CLABSI when US-guided supraclavicular BCV catheters were used compared to standard ECCs in preterm infants. Importantly, such a difference has been observed despite BCV catheters being used in higher-risk infants and staying in place for a longer period [22] . Seemingly, the observed reduction in CLABSI was driven by a reduced incidence of CLABSI episodes caused by CoNS. While mortality of SCN sepsis is low, the detrimental effects on neurologic development are substantial and similar to those of more virulent bacteria [23, 24] . Therefore, we consider our finding of clinical relevance.",

In neonates, percutaneous CVCs are believed to carry a greater risk of CLABSI than ECCs, although supporting evidence is lacking [27] . Of note, no study has compared US-guided BCV cannulation with standard vascular access in preterm infants. One previous study by Habas et al. specifically assessed the risk of CLABSI with US-guided supraclavicular BCV cannulation against other CVC insertion sites (femoral, internal jugular vein, and infraclavicular subclavian vein) in older children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), with the authors reporting a reduced CLABSI density rate (BCV, 2.8/1000 days vs other-CVC, 8.96/1000 days; p = 0.006) [28] . In a retrospective analysis, Biasucci D et al. observed a remarkable reduction in CLABSI from 15/1000 to 1.5/ 1000 days after the implementation of a CVC insertion bundle in the PICU [29] . The bundle included systematic assessment of central veins using the RaCeVa protocol and resulted in a radical shift in the choice of CVC insertion site in favor of the BCV (from 0 to 85% after bundle implementation) [30] . Other innovative elements in their bundle included routine tunneling of the catheter, sutureless fixation, glue sealing of the exit site, and specific simulation training; therefore, it is difficult to ascertain the exact contribution of BCV cannulation to the observed decrease in CLABSI.",

However, the reasons why this technique may reduce the risk of catheter colonization and infection are less obvious. Coagulation activation and the formation of a fibroblastic sleeve along the catheter interfere with biofilm formation, bacterial growth, and colonization of the extraluminal side of the catheter [32, 33] . Additionally, the high first-attempt insertion success rate achieved with the US-guided supraclavicular approach might lead to less endothelial damage during insertion and reduced thrombogenesis. In fact, in our study, the number of puncture attempts was an independent risk factor for CLABSI. Moreover, blood flow stasis is a classic pathogenic determinant of thrombus formation; in this sense, among the veins amenable to percutaneous catheterization, the BCV is the largest and has the highest flow, which permits a high catheter-to-vein diameter ratio without flow disruption [34] [35] [36] . Exit sites in the supraclavicular area may also contribute to reducing contamination and avoiding site humidity, which facilitates easier adhesion of dressings [37] . In contrast to ECC lines, a large-bore CVC facilitates repeated blood sampling, avoiding peripheral venipunctures during catheter use, a factor that has been implicated in bacteremia and catheter colonization during the use of ECCs [38] .",

Additionally, insertion failure rates are relatively high, and progression to a central position is hazardous even in experienced hands [40] .

We consider that there are some important limitations for the widespread use of BCV cannulation in preterm infants. The insertion of a percutaneous CVC through the BCV in a preterm is a challenging and delicate procedure. To be performed safely, it requires a deeply sedated and motionless infant, which is not always feasible. In addition, to be fully implemented, this approach would require around-the-clock availability of staff with sufficient expertise in US-guided cannulation. Finally, studies supporting BCV cannulation have been performed by highly experienced groups (pediatric anesthesiologists and vascular access teams) and have consisted of case series with near 100% insertion success rates but without any comparison to standard techniques; therefore, a publication bias may be a concern [4, 31] . However, if our findings are confirmed in other studies, reduced CLABSI should be taken into account together with already known technical advantages in the decision to insert BCV catheters in preterm infants, and the indication of this new vascular access might be expanded.",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. This is a single-center nonrandomized retrospective study that included a limited number of preterm infants; accordingly, our results should be considered a proof of concept and taken with caution. As all observational studies, there is an inherent risk of confounding bias. We tried to reduce this risk by selecting matched controls. However, a more refined approach would have been to include all patients and perform propensity score matching [42] ; in our infant population, BCV cannulation was performed in selected infants by a unique experienced intensivist, whereas ECCs were inserted by a team of 10 nurses who might have heterogeneous levels of expertise [43] . Regardless, all nurses were certified neonatal practitioners and used the same protocol for ECC insertion. Infants with BCV catheters received more days of antibiotic therapy during CVC use, which might have had a protective effect on CLABSI and act as a confounder. However, the antibiotic protocol was common and the difference in antibiotic days coverage was driven by differences in indwelling time without an observable effect of antibiotics on CLABSI rate in the multivariate analysis. In addition, the CVC maintenance policy was the same for both types of catheters. Finally, as BCV catheters were inserted in patients in poorer condition and the indwelling duration was longer than that of ECCs, we think that there was no significant risk of bias favoring BCV catheters. Some aspects of our CVC insertion and maintenance policy are controversial. We used surgical suture for fixation of BCV catheters. This should be avoided whenever possible given that it may increase the risk of infection. Commercially available sutureless devices are a better option. In the same line, the use of low-dose heparin to maintain catheter patency is outdated and not supported by current scientific evidence [44] . Finally, our ECC CLABSI rate is relatively high compared to those reported by studies from other countries. For these reasons, our results may lack external validity [12, 22] .",
