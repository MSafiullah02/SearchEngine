One study in Saudi Arabia reported that 42% of the MERS\u2010CoV cases had contact with camels, but the number of cases included in the study was limited (n = 12) (Memish et al., 2014). A review by the MERS\u2010CoV World Health Organization Research Group revealed that among 51 investigated primary cases, 55% (n = 28) reported contacts with animals but just 10% (n = 5) reported contacts with dromedary camels (The World Health Organization Mers\u2010Cov Research Group, 2013). Among 517 primary cases in the ECDC line listing, only 23 reported to have had animal contacts: 12 had direct contact with dromedary camels; 10 visited a farm (unspecified type); and 11 had unspecified contact with animals (the list is not mutually exclusive). All but one case were male with a mean age of 56 years (range 25\u201382). In addition, five primary cases reported drinking dromedary camel milk.

From what we have been able to establish, the gender distribution among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appears to be balanced, and the same can be assumed for household contacts of primary cases. Therefore, the imbalance among primary cases is most likely the result of differentiated exposure rather than a biological gender difference in susceptibility. It is plausible that exposure to the source of infection differs between the sexes and across age groups. Because camel rearing is an exclusively male activity that is also popular among middle\u2010aged and retired men, this social activity could help explain the gender difference and age\u2010distribution among primary cases. Both greater susceptibility to infection and higher severity among people who have underlying medical conditions (comorbidities) could help explain the higher incidence among older age groups.",

The lack of systematic recording of exposure and a potential recall bias could be factors influencing these results. Animal workers, including slaughterhouse workers, do not seem to be over\u2010represented among MERS\u2010CoV cases. It is possible that animal workers develop functional immunity as a result of repetitive contacts with infected camels and therefore are at lower risk of developing severe illness. A matched case\u2013control study looking at seroconversion rate in animal workers compared to the general population would provide valuable information.",

MERS\u2010CoV is likely to be an acute infection in camels, and there is no evidence for prolonged viral shedding beyond a few weeks. Where full genome MERS\u2010CoV sequences from dromedaries are available, they are highly homologous to MERS\u2010CoV sequences recovered from human isolates.

When MERS\u2010CoV is injected into raw camel milk, the virus is stable but destroyed by heat treatment at 63\u00b0C for 30 min (van Doremalen et al., 2014). While live virus can be found in raw milk, it is still necessary to estimate virus concentrations and establish whether and for how long the virus remains infectious to humans.

While extensive farming is slowly declining, the other types of farming systems are growing. As a result of the rapid urbanization, Saudi camel farms have gradually concentrated around cities to respond to the increasing demand for camel milk and other camel products (Abdallah and Faye, 2013; Agricultural Research for Development, 2013a). A similar trend is observed in all the desert regions where rapid urbanization and increasing populations have increased the demand for commercial camel products (Agricultural Research for Development, 2013a). In East Africa, camel farming remains a predominantly extensive practice with the exception of Kenya and Djibouti (Faye et al., 2003).",

The critical next step is to confirm and eventually control the animal source of human infections. It is remarkable that, 2 years after the onset of this outbreak, there are still important gaps in the descriptive epidemiology of the disease. It is crucial to conduct the field epidemiology investigations that can disentangle the risk factors for infection and confirm the source of infection and the routes of transmission from the animal source to humans. A first step could be to re\u2010interview and reclassify all surviving case patients and the relatives of the fatal cases. This would be a time\u2010consuming exercise, but we believe it could generate important new hypotheses and insights that could help control this outbreak. Further microbiological experiments on milk, meat and urine should urgently be conducted to establish whether they are (effective) vehicles for virus transmission.",
