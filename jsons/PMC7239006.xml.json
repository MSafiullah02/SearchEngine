In 2002-2003, SARS-CoV infected 8096 people and killed 774, while MERS-CoV has infected 2494 people and killed 858 since 2012 [2]. Recently, on 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identified a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. On 3 March 2020, the WHO has affirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection had become pandemic; multiple infection routes (via the respiratory route, contact with fomites, and probably also faecal-oral) and high contagiousness [3], with the highest estimated R0 of 4.6, seem to be essential factors for this global outbreak.",

From the beginning of the epidemic in Italy (21st February 2020) to date, 7033 nasopharyngeal swabs were performed on hospital users, referred to pre-triage of the emergency department. These tests were justified by epidemiological (close contacts) and clinical (ageusia, anosmia, cough, fever, myalgia, weakness or SARI symptoms) criteria. Among the tests, 1065 were positive (15.14%), and 5968 were negative (84.86%). All involved workers reported contact modalities with these patients to the control room through the reporting system. Contacts of employees were also collected. Based on these reports, 560 HCWs\u2019 contact tracing complete forms were collected to determine all people who had contact with these workers. Moreover, based on the illustrated decision-making process in Figure 1, 1303 swabs were performed in the hospital setting during a 30-day observation period due to the high HCWs\u2019 close contact risk assessment. Of these, only 16 (1.38%) swabs were positive (2 after the second confirming test). Moreover, regarding swabs performed in home isolation by the Prevention Department, the other 7 HCWs were positive and communicated with the COVID-19 Control Room. Overall, 23 HCWs were infected by SARS-CoV-2, with an average age of 48.6 years. Among these, 16 were physicians (2 of whom were in training), 5 were nurses and 2 were social health assistants (SAHs). Regarding the most commonly reported symptoms, weakness was present in 72% of workers, diarrhoea in 60%, cough in 56% and fever in 52%. Almost half of infected HCWs complained about anosmia and ageusia, and these were referred to as the most common disorders.",

            "text": "Moreover, establishing preventive protocols is essential to provide safe guidance to HCWs and consequently reduce their work-related stress, which is a known factor able to influence work performance [9]. The reporting system is also essential to prevent nosocomial outbreaks from HCWs: reports through this platform have been mandatory both for professional and environmental close contacts. In our protocol, the COVID-19 Control Room has a central role to cooperate with extra-hospital Prevention Departments about suspected and confirmed cases of HCWs placed in home isolation; it also provides to evaluate all people who had contact previously with involved HCW and it ordains domiciliary nasopharyngeal swabs. It would be good to monitor all patients who in the hospital setting have had contacts with involved HCWs by their hospital wards for a 14-day period; instead, if patients have been discharged from the hospital, they should be monitored in home isolation by the Prevention Department. Compliance with all appropriate prevention procedures, together with detailed reporting systems, are crucial to avoid hospital outbreaks and yo achieve a very low prevalence among HCWs. In this regard, Wang et al. [10], in a retrospective single-centre case series of approximately 138 COVID-19 patients, estimated that 29% were HCWs working in the same hospital centre and infected during shifts due to occupational exposure to infected patients, compared with 0.4% during our observation period. In this regard, half of positive HCWs complained about ageusia and anosmia: they seem to be early symptoms, if present, and so great attention should be given to there from the outset. HCWs occupationally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be aware of the strategic importance of referring any close contact to the hospital management system, with a subsequent careful focus on all secondary contacts. Moreover, ward managers should ensure that there is effective performance of self-monitoring procedures, with particular regard to HCWs subjected to active surveillance.",
