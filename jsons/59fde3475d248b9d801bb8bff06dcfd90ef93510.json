The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.",

            "text": "As we write this paper, some countries managed to control the disease. Others 20 are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. And some countries are in the initial phase of the pandemic. South Korea had the first case entering the country on 20 January and after the initial outbreak was able to dramatically slow the spread of the disease, flattening the pandemic curve [3, 17] . Italy is one of the countries that has reported a large number of deaths related to the 25 COVID-19 at more than 13, 000. In Brazil the pandemic is in its early stages with the first case of infection reported on February 26th, 2020. One month after the first confirmed case in Brazil, 3,904 cases and 114 deaths have already been registered [18] . Other papers found in the literature have proposed more compartments in their models (like exposed, asymptomatic, and many others) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] . 35 Here, we decided to keep the model as simple as possible, since adding more compartments increases the number of unknown parameters to be estimated, which in turn hinders the accurate calibration of the model. In addition, to face the fast dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic, the model includes time-dependent coefficients. 40 The characterization of COVID-19 in the three countries is performed using the technique of inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ). Therefore, during the calibration of the models, the coefficients are treated as unknown probability density functions (PDFs). Once estimated, the PDFs of the coefficients, their means, standard deviations (SD), and shape provide important information on 45 model parameters that are essential in the characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the inverse UQ, we observed that different PDFs of the model coefficients were needed to explain the distinct dynamics of the COVID-19 in the three countries. In summary, the methods proposed in this work assist in the development of specific models for each country and in the quantification of 50 the level of uncertainties present in the model parameters and results.",

Most of them describe the spread of COVID-19 based on SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered) or SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) modifications. For example, [25] extended the SIR model partitioning the population in eight stages, [26] used an age-structured SEIR model, and stochastic models have also been used [27] . 65 In this work, the mathematical model proposed is a non-linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) [28, 29, 30] , based on the classic compartmental SIRD model [31, 32, 33] . We decided to keep the model as simple as possible since adding more compartments increases the number of unknown parameters to be estimated, which in turn hinders the accurate calibration of the model. In addition, to face the fast dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the model includes time-dependent coefficients. The model is described by the following equations:",

The estimation of notification of infected cases in S. Korea is very high, around 95%, while in Brazil and Italy the notification is around 10% and 30%, respectively. Therefore, the number of infected cases (I) in these 185 two countries is between 3 to 10 times the number of reported cases (I r ). These differences on percentage of notification correlates with the different dynamics observed so far in these three countries. Indeed, S. Korea has successfully tested its population and is an example of less underreported cases [45] , furthermore it is also an example of a country that has decreased the infection curve [3] . Brazil has the largest estimated value for underreported cases (see Table A In this work, the contact reduction, a(t), was modeled as a linear function that decays from 1 to r. After \u2206 days, a(t) remains constant at r. It is a simplification, where we only consider a single intervention in terms of restriction policy. Nevertheless, this single intervention was enough to recover the very distinct dynamics observed in the three countries. Multiple phases of social 235 distancing policies could be implemented in future works. Also, other timedependent functions could be used for a(t), instead of a linear one, such as the exponential decay used in [23] .",

Likewise, clinical studies of 250 new potential treatments [4, 6, 7, 8] , will also affect other parameters of the model. Our results, based on data collected until April 6, suggest that the percentage of deaths among infected patients (which is different from the estimation made using the notification of infected cases) in Brazil is around 1.5% and is closer to S. Korea than to Italy, 3.1%. The notification of infected cases in S. Korea is Period from symptoms to recovery (day) [7, 17] and \u03c4 2 vs. m. This is expected, since \u03b2 = m(1/(\u03c4 1 +\u03c4 2 )) models the mortality rate 325 of infected individuals. The observed significant negative correlations between \u03c4 3 and m vs. \u03c4 1 are also expected since the recovery rate \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 m)(1/(\u03c4 1 + \u03c4 3 )).",

For each time t, I r (t) and D(t) are also PDFs, in response to the process of forward uncertainty quantification. It should be noted that the same model, with different parameters, was able 145 to reproduce the very distinct scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, Italy, and S. Korea. Analyzing the results of the forward UQ, we note that the uncertainties of the simulations increase in the following order, S. Korea, Italy and Brazil. This order correlates with the estimated parameter \u03b8, that models the notification of positive cases, and with the phase of the COVID-19 pandemic 150 in each country. Therefore, earlier phases pose more challenges and uncertainties to the modeling of the pandemic, as well as the underreporting of cases. Due to the descriptive nature of the model, the analysis of the estimated parameters allows the identification of important characteristics of the phenomena.For instance, we observed that the transmission rate, b, is higher in Italy (0.37) Simulation results for Italy, S.

The percentage of mortality, m, is also higher in Italy (3.1%) than in S. Korea (1.8%). Brazil has once again a large SD, with estimated values for m between 1% and 2%.

In S. Korea we observe interesting negative correlations 195 between b and \u2206, the transmission rate and the time interval for the social response to mitigation policies, and t i , the start of the mitigation policies. This means that for higher transmission rates and higher delays for social response, the initial day of mitigation policies needs to be earlier. For Italy, the strong negative correlations between \u03c4 2 and \u03b8, and \u03c4 1 and \u2206 are less intuitive. Since 200 the mortality rate is inversely proportional to \u03c4 2 , a decrease in \u03c4 2 increases the ratio between the number of dead and infected individuals. However, data reflects the ratio between dead and reported infected individuals. Therefore, to reestablish the fraction observed in the data, the value of \u03b8 needs to be increased.The negative correlation between \u03c4 1 and \u2206 can be interpreted by the delay for205 reporting positive cases, I r = \u03b8I(t \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03c4 1 ). Large delays for notification (high values of \u03c4 1 ) demands fast social response to the mitigation policies, i.e., small values for \u2206. In Brazil, the same interpretations above for Italy explains the strong positive correlations between \u03b8 and \u2206, \u03c4 1 and t i , m and \u03b8, and \u03c4 1 and \u03b8. These correlations reveal the importance of the model for the reported infected 210 cases, I r , which plays extremely important roles in describing the dynamics in Italy and Brazil.

The number of infected people 295 in S. Korea has been declining for almost a month. Therefore, the simulations performed in this study suggest that non-pharmaceutical interventions are decisive in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, and underreporting challenges the management of the pandemic by adding significant uncertainties in the characterization of the COVID-19 dynamics. The results also highlight a delicate 300 situation for Brazil.
