The scenario led to numerous forms of fraud and corruption within SITA, at the expense of improving service delivery to citizens of South African [8]. Today, corruption and fraud cases are killing the dreams for a better South Africa for many citizens of South Africa [30, 31].

The continuous use of the same technology reinforce that technology in the organisation [24]. The technology, in such a way becomes taken for granted within the organization [24]. The technology now dictates behaviour so that it becomes an interpretive template for those that makes use of the IT artefact [24]. With regards to corporate governance, the BPMS acts as a corporate governance behavioural template, as indicated in Fig. 7.\n",
