            "text": "\nPasteurella multocida is the aetiological agent of fowl cholera, a widely distributed and economically important disease of poultry, particularly chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese (Rhoades and Rimler, 1989, Rimler and Glisson, 1997). The organism is also responsible for disease in wild birds, commercially raised game birds and caged birds (Rhoades and Rimler, 1989). Four capsular serogroups are recognised among avian strains of P. multocida, namely A, B, D and F (Rhoades and Rimler, 1987, Rhoades and Rimler, 1989, Rimler and Rhoades, 1987). Strains of serogroup A are recognised as the primary cause of fowl cholera, whereas isolates of serogroups B, D and F are less frequently associated with disease (Rhoades and Rimler, 1987, Rhoades and Rimler, 1989, Wilson et al., 1993). In addition, some avian strains of P. multocida are non-encapsulated and are not serogroupable (Rhoades and Rimler, 1987, Wilson et al., 1993). Sixteen somatic serotypes (1\u201316) are also recognised in P. multocida (Rhoades and Rimler, 1987, Rhoades and Rimler, 1989, Rhoades and Rimler, 1990a) and most of these have been demonstrated in avian capsular serogroup A strains (Rhoades and Rimler, 1987).",

In particular, a study of the population genetics of Australian strains using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) identified 56 electrophoretic types among only 81 field isolates (Blackall et al., 1998). Based on DNA\u2013DNA hybridisation and sugar fermentation patterns P. multocida has been subdivided into three subspecies, subsp. multocida, subsp. gallicida, and subsp. septica (Mutters et al., 1985) and all of these have been isolated from birds (Snipes et al., 1989, Hirsh et al., 1990, Fegan et al., 1995). However, conflicting results from ribotyping and 16S rRNA sequence data (Petersen et al., 2001) suggest that the precise phylogenetic relationships of strains representing each of these subspecies is complex and has yet to be satisfactorily resolved.",

Both whole-cell bacterins and live vaccines composed of attenuated strains are currently available but neither is entirely satisfactory. Bacterins only induce serotype-specific protection, whereas live vaccines sometimes cause disease (Bierer and Derieux, 1975, Schlink and Olson, 1987, Prantner et al., 1990) and there is increasing interest in the development of sub-unit vaccines (Kasten et al., 1995, Luo et al., 1999). Outer membrane antigens that might be considered as potential vaccine candidates include the heat-modifiable or OmpA and the porin or OmpH proteins (Vasfi Marandi and Mittal, 1996, Vasfi Marandi and Mittal, 1997, Luo et al., 1997, Luo et al., 1999). Both of these proteins are expressed in high copy number, are surface exposed and immunogenic (Hancock, 1991, Tagawa et al., 1993, Yi and Murphy, 1997, Zeng et al., 1999, Neary et al., 2001). The OmpH protein has been shown to be heterogeneous in strains of P. multocida representing somatic serotypes 1\u201316 (Luo et al., 1999) and there is evidence that anti-OmpH antibodies are protective in chickens (Luo et al., 1999) and mice (Vasfi Marandi et al., 1996). There is less information available about the OmpA protein of P.\nmultocida, but this protein also exhibits variation in other bacterial species (Duim et al., 1997, Webb and Cripps, 1998).",

Capsular type E was not detected among the population sampled. The P. multocida-specific primers were omitted from the capsular primer mixture because they interfered with the capsule-specific primers and resulted in a reduction of capsular PCR product (i.e. reduced band intensity). Therefore, isolates that were negative for capsular typing were confirmed as untypable P. multocida in separate PCR assays with the P. multocida-specific primers (Townsend et al., 2001).

The OMP profiles of the 100 isolates were analysed by SDS-PAGE and provisionally assigned to OMP-types based on profile similarity (described below). Isolates assigned to the same OMP-type were subsequently re-run on up to three or four occasions such that isolates of the same OMP-type were directly compared on the same gel. An OMP classification scheme was devised-based, firstly, on molecular mass variation of the two major proteins, OmpA and OmpH (OMP-type 1, 2, etc.), and, secondly, on variation of minor protein patterns (OMP-type 1.1, 1.2, etc.).",

The OmpH porin protein is tightly associated with peptidoglycan and is not released unless heated at a temperature of approximately 60 \u00b0C or higher (Rosenbusch, 1974). Therefore, the OmpH protein does not migrate into the gel unless heated at 60 \u00b0C or higher prior to SDS-PAGE. In contrast, the OmpA protein is not associated with peptidoglycan and freely migrates into the gel after heat-treatment at temperatures below 60 \u00b0C prior to SDS-PAGE. However, the OmpA protein undergoes a characteristic conformational change when heated at 100 \u00b0C that results in an increase in its apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE gels (Beher et al., 1980). Therefore, to identify OmpA and OmpH, one isolate representing each OMP-type was subjected to heat-treatment at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 \u00b0C prior to SDS-PAGE. The results for two isolates of OMP-types 3.1 and 10.2 are shown in Fig. 2\n. The OmpA (A) and OmpH (H) proteins for each OMP-type are indicated in Fig. 3\nand the results are described below.",

Profiles representing each of these OMP-types (with the exception of OMP-types 1.3 and 10.3) are shown in Fig. 3. The molecular mass of OmpA (A) varied from 36.9 to 37.9 kDa and that of OmpH (H) varied from 33.1 to 38.3 kDa. The distribution of OMP-types among the avian isolates is shown in Table 1. Isolates of OMP-types 2.2 (15%), 7.1 (11%), 1.2 (9%) and 4.1 (9%) were the most numerous and accounted for 44% of the total.

However, Townsend et al. (2001) described an alternative and highly specific multiplex capsular PCR assay that is based on nucleotide sequence variation within the five capsular biosynthetic loci. This PCR-based capsular typing method was used in the present study and found to be a reliable and rapid method for capsular typing large numbers of P. multocida isolates. Reference strains were used as internal standards and no cases of ambiguity occurred. The observed incidence of capsular serotypes in our sample was very similar to that described in the study of 246 isolates by Rhoades and Rimler (1987). In the latter investigation, capsular types A, F, B and D were associated with 67, 5, 2 and 2% of isolates, respectively, whereas 24% of strains were untypable. The significantly higher incidence of serotype A strains with respect to isolates of serotypes B, D and F in this and previous studies (Rhoades and Rimler, 1987, Wilson et al., 1993) suggests that the various serotypes differ in their virulence characteristics. Although virulence studies have shown that strains of serotypes B, D and F are potentially pathogenic (Rimler and Rhoades, 1987, Rhoades and Rimler, 1988, Rhoades and Rimler, 1990b), there is very little information about the comparative virulence of strains representing the different serotypes.",

Fifty-six percent of the isolates were represented by 15 OMP-types, whereas 44% of the isolates were associated with four OMP-types. The high degree of heterogeneity observed in the OMP profiles, and of OmpA and OmpH in particular, was not unexpected because previous studies have shown that avian P. multocida strains are extremely diverse (Snipes et al., 1989, Christiansen et al., 1992, Wilson et al., 1993, Wilson et al., 1995, Blackall et al., 1995, Blackall et al., 1998, Petersen et al., 2001). In particular, Blackall et al. (1998) identified 56 electrophoretic types among only 81 P. multocida isolates from Australian poultry by MLEE. In a previous study of Mannheimia haemolytica (Davies and Donachie, 1996), 184 strains were sub-divided into three distinct groups based on their OMP profiles and these were subsequently shown to represent phylogenetically distinct lineages by MLEE (Davies et al., 1997). However, no such demarcation was apparent among the OMP profiles of the avian P. multocida isolates.",

The exclusive association of isolates of the less common capsular types with specific OMP-types provided evidence that OMP-types mark individual clonal groups of P. multocida (Achtman and Pluschke, 1986). For example, isolates of OMP-type 1.3 were associated with capsular type F, isolates of OMP-type 10 were untypable, isolates of OMP-type 12.1 were associated with capsular type B and isolates of OMP-type 13.1 were associated with capsular type D (Table 1). Furthermore, almost all of the isolates representing each of these groups originated from a different regional laboratory. This is significant because a characteristic feature of clonal bacterial populations is that strains representing the same clone originate from widespread geographic origins (Selander and Musser, 1990). The association of capsular types B and D and certain untypable isolates, with specific OMP-types is also important because it demonstrates for the first time that strains of these uncommon capsular types, together with untypable isolates, probably represent specific clones of P. multocida. In contrast, Dziva et al. (2001) were unable to demonstrate a relationship between RAPD patterns and capsular serogroups in their study of Zimbabwean isolates of P. multocida (Dziva et al., 2001). Isolates of OMP-types 2.2 and 6.1 were associated with capsular types A and F. This observation is probably due to the close relationships of these two capsular types (Townsend et al., 2001).",

In this respect, avian P. multocida strains differ from many other pathogens because the majority of cases of disease were associated with a relatively large number of OMP-types/clones. A possible reason for this is that the isolates were recovered from a diverse range of lesions and tissues and were associated with different types of infection ranging from pneumonia and septicaemia to sinusitis, conjunctivitis and swollen head. High levels of diversity were also observed among Eschericha coli strains isolated from chickens with swollen-head syndrome and from birds with colibacillosis (White et al., 1990). It was suggested that the large number of clonal genotypes associated with these avian diseases was due either to the opportunistic nature of the infections or to the widespread occurrence of unknown virulence factors (White et al., 1990, Whittam, 1995). Swollen-head syndrome associated with E. coli is thought to be the result of a secondary infection subsequent to an initial viral infection caused by paramyxovirus, coronavirus, or pneumovirus. The high level of diversity observed among avian P. multocida isolates, together with the wide range of clinical symptoms and tissues of origin, similarly suggests that a high proportion of the isolates might represent opportunistic pathogens of relatively low virulence. In particular, isolates associated with conjunctivitis, sinusitis and swollen head could potentially be secondary pathogens following initial viral infection. Confirmation of this hypothesis will require the comparison of bacterial isolates from diseased birds with the normal avian flora.",

            "text": "The OmpA and OmpH proteins of avian isolates of P.\nmultocida were shown to be heterogeneous since numerous molecular mass variants were identified (Fig. 3). However, the OmpH protein (33.1\u201338.3 kDa) is clearly more heterogeneous than the OmpA protein (36.9\u201337.9 kDa). Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the OmpH proteins representing the 16 somatic serotypes of P. multocida has shown that the molecular mass heterogeneity of this protein is due to variation in the number of amino acids (318\u2013333) in the protein (Luo et al., 1999). However, most of this variation is confined to two discrete hypervariable regions (amino acids 60\u201380 and 200\u2013220) which are thought to correspond to external surface-exposed loops (Luo et al., 1999). Similar heterogeneity occurs in the corresponding P2 (OmpH) and P5 (OmpA) proteins of Haemophilus influenzae, and has also been shown to be due to differences in the size of hypervariable surface-exposed loop regions (Forbes et al., 1992, Sikkema and Murphy, 1992, Duim et al., 1997, Webb and Cripps, 1998). These surface-exposed loops are thought to interact with the host immune system and, by undergoing antigenic variation, provide the bacterium with an important defence mechanism (Yi and Murphy, 1994, Yi and Murphy, 1997, Neary et al., 2001). Furthering knowledge of the molecular basis of this diversity in P. multocida will lead to a better understanding of the role of these proteins in avian disease and contribute to the development of improved vaccines.",

A possible explanation for the high level of strain diversity observed in the study is that many of the isolates were associated with chronic infections, were recovered from a wide range of lesions and tissues, and represent opportunistic pathogens. The association of certain capsular types with specific OMP-types suggests that OMP profiles mark individual clones of P. multocida. In particular, isolates of the uncommon capsular types B and D and certain untypable isolates, represent distinct clonal groups. The OmpA and OmpH proteins exhibit extensive molecular mass heterogeneity that might provide a selective advantage to the pathogen by generating antigenic variation.",
