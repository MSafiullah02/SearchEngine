Thousands of human infections have been diagnosed in China along with many other countries, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3.",

            "text": "Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shared 79% sequence identify to SARS-CoV (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and they may both share the ACE2 as host receptor according to structural analyses. [4] SARS-CoV uses ACE2 as one of the main receptors for the entry into the host cells which plays a crucial role in the disease infection. [5] The target towards the interaction of the virus and receptor may be able to treat the disease. ACE2 is newly described as Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) component and modulates blood pressure. [6] The expression and distribution of ACE2 has been reported in heart, lungs and kidneys, which exhibits tissue-specific activity patterns. [7] [8] [9] Previous studies have also shown the expression of ACE2 in the placenta. [10] The placenta is a unique mixed organ, acting as heart, lungs, liver, kidneys for the fetus, which is formed only during pregnancy and plays a major role in preventing maternal-fetal transmission of pathogens. [11] It has been reported that members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) may pose greater risk in pregnant women than non-pregnant individuals and are responsible for severe complications during pregnancy. [12, 13] Considering the new SARS-CoV-2 seems to share similar pathogenic and cell receptor as SARS-CoV, the new coronavirus may have the vertical transmission potential to the fetus in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2. [14] Given the current lack of data of the potential and outcome of pregnancy infected by the SARS-CoV2, we use the promising scRNA-seq data to evaluate the expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface and different organs to give a better perspective of transmission potential of the virus to the fetus on the cellular level.

We obtained single cell transcriptome data sequenced by 10X Genomics of early placenta (6~14 gestational weeks) containing ~65,000 cells [15] , and replotted the cell clusters using the canonical markers and cell classification in the original literature ( Figure 1A) . And 32 subtypes were observed, of which four main cell types expressed ACE2 gene, including decidual stromal cells (dS) and decidual perivascular cells (dP) in decidua, and villous cytotrophoblast (VCT) and syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) in placenta ( Figure   1B ). The extravillous trophoblast (EVT) did not express ACE2 at this time. In another independent single cell study of trophoblasts in human placenta confirmed the expression of ACE2 in VCT and SCT ( Figure 1C ). [16] In addition, the EVT cells have extremely low level of ACE2 at early placenta (8 week) which was consistent with previous study, while the ACE2 expression was significantly increased in EVT at later stage of pregnancy (24 week) ( Figure 1C ). This suggests that the expression level of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface may be increased along with trimester of pregnancy.",

            "text": "this, the urgent question needs to be addressed is that whether the SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted vertically to the fetus and further cause clinically infection of fetus.Based on the scRNA-seq data of early human placenta (first trimester), we have identified the high expression of ACE2 in four main cell types including decidual perivascular (dP) cells and decidual stromal (dS) cells in decidua, villous cytotrophoblast (VCT) and syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) cells in placenta. However, the expression of ACE2 was at extremely low level in extravillous villous (EVT) at first trimester. The second study of human placenta confirmed the result and showed increasing expression of ACE2 in EVT at 24 week. The major function of the placenta is performed by trophoblast cells including VCT, SCT and EVT.[22] The SCT is the outer lining of the placental villi which has direct contact with maternal blood flowing into the intervillous space which also plays as the main site of maternal and fetal exchange.[23] The high expression of ACE2 in these cells suggests that placenta has the potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and may cause placenta dysfunction and pregnancy complications. Yet there is no scRNA-seq data of the third trimester of human placenta, the ACE2 expression in maternal-fetal interface may be increased along with trimester of pregnancy given the existing data shown.We then assessed the expression of ACE2 in the main organs including heart, lung, liver and kidney. The expression of ACE2 was detected in the main cell types of heart like Cardiomyocytes (CM) and Smooth muscle cells/Pericytes (SMC/Peri).",

            "text": "may not be responsible for the vertical transmission of virus, but may play essential role in neonatal infection via respiratory transmission. Alternatively, the arterial endothelial cell expression of ACE2 may contribute to the potential intrauterine infection of fetal lung. The data of a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung was analyzed, and we observed ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3 which indicating the high level ACE2 may make neonate vulnerable target of SARS-CoV-2. Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, a case was tested positive of SARS-CoV-2 just 36h after birth whose mother was with SARS-CoV-2.[27,28] Huang, et al(2020)has recently reported the result of pregnancy of nine pregnant women who had pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV2.[27] All the infants and samples including amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs showed negative result of the virus. However, given the small sample size, the short time between illness onset and delivery and the biased included pregnant women who were all at the late-stage of pregnancy and gave birth by cesarean section, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 still cannot be rule out in this study. Besides, the biophysical and structural evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV.[29] It's still crucial to pay special attention to pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the fetus with possible clinical infection by the virus.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the expression of ACE2 in human maternal-fetal interface and the main fetal organs. Although previous clinical studies have not observed vertical transmission of SARS-COV-2 among limited cases, this phenomenon still need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.",
