Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a byproduct or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 \u00b0C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol (less than 10 wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten. The creation of these masks could simultaneously be effective in reducing the transmittance of infectious diseases and pave the way for environmentally benign sustainable products.",

The geographical expansion of the disease beyond the initial epicentre has risen the need for effective and widely available medical facilities. It also proved that the conventional production lines cannot fulfil the demand during a pandemic. The transmission of COVID-19 occurs through cough or respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, and contaminated surfaces (Chan et al., 2020) . It is imperative that medical professionals are not infected, which will ensure the continued care of patients and those subclinical patients, during sickness and after recovery, do not transmit the virus. For e.g. the availability of personal protective equipment (PPEs) amongst Chinese health care workers led to very little spread of the ongoing coronavirus within hospitals. However, more than 25% of health care workers in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 infection potency and transmission is lacking. Filtering facemasks are non-pharmacologically used for decreasing the inhalation exposure to airborne particles associated with health hazards, like influenza viruses, thereby preventing rapid transmission of infectious diseases.",

Although health care workers usually use these respiratory protection devices, they are extended to non-occupational use and become actively sought after commodity during an epidemic or pandemic (Cohen and Enserink, 2009 ). At present, masks have become a universal requirement since there is a dearth of other personal protective measures like vaccines and antiviral drugs. Moreover, N95 respirators are generally in short supply and are not available in numerous countries during an ongoing pandemic (Loeb et al., 2009 ). The retailers of many countries report a shortage of masks whereas online retailers like Amazon are rising the prices exorbitantly (Website2) and course (2.5 -10 \u00b5m), denoted as PM 0.1, PM 2.5 and PM 10, respectively (Kadam et al., 2018) . The filtration occurs through interception, inertial impaction, diffusion, inter-Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 molecular/electrostatic/gravitational interactions of the target particles on the surface of the filter medium. For virion particles, whose diameter is very small (ca. 20 -400 nm), Brownian diffusion is the central filtration mechanism (Mao, 2017 ). An infected individual through breathing, speech, sneezing, and coughing, releases pathogenic aerosols. Facemasks, therefore, provide respiratory protection from the infected subject by the filtration capability of the media against the aerosol particles. Since the size of a coronavirus is in the range of 160 -200 nm (Pellett et al., 2014) , non-woven filter media would be much more effective than the woven counterparts (Chellamani et al., 2013) . In fact, non-woven filters exhibit higher barrier properties compared to cotton, petroleum-based polymers (e.g. polyester) and some woven filters of advanced nature. Non-woven filter performs its action through interactions between the target PM and individual fibres of the filter medium (Chellamani et al., 2013) . These nonwoven filter media can be manufactured by the process of electrospinning that is one of the most cost-effective and facile methods to create fibrous membranes having a variety of fibre diameter and porosity (Purwar et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Electrospun filter membranes have shown great potential for filtration applications through controlled manufacturing that allows tailored material structure for targeted applications (Lv et al., 2018; Neisiany et al., 2020) . Versatile fibres can be produced from an array of raw materials by the electrospinning process with the diameters in the range of tens of nanometres An electrospinning setup is shown in Figure 1a , constituting of a high-voltage power source, a syringe pump for producing the polymer solution jet, a grounded collector, a spinneret that is electrically conductive, and a polymer solution that is to be electrospun. The spinnability and the final fibre properties are factors of three aspects, namely, processing, polymer solution, and environmental parameters. The processing parameters include applied voltage, feed rate and air gap whereas polymer solution parameters include concentration, solution viscosity, polymer\"s molecular weight, and solvent\"s evaporation. The environmental parameters are related to temperature and humidity (Lee et al., 2018) . For the filtration of virion particles, the pore size of the filter membrane is the deterministic factor for its performance. Studies have shown that the pore size of randomly oriented electrospun nanofibre mats is affected by the diameter of individual fibres. For example, in a study by Ma et al. (Ma et al., 2011) it was reported that the average and maximum pore size of a nanofibre membrane were, respectively, ca. 3 and 10 times the average diameter of the individual nanofibers. Hence, a \"designer\" nanofibre membrane having preferred pore size and fibre diameter can be produced by modification of the electrospinning parameters. A wide range of biopolymers, including poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(lactic acid), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), alginate, chitin, chitosan, cellulose acetate, polycaprolactone or blends of these biopolymers, have been utilised to develop electrospun nanofibre membranes for filtration (Kadam et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2018) . It should be noted some of them are biodegradable while others are not. In addition, carbonisation of some of these biopolymers is possible and have been studied previously.",

Furthermore, gluten can also be electrospun into nanofibre membranes. In a study, 5 wt% gluten was blended with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and electrospun into nanofibre mats that exhibited a filtration efficiency of 99% towards gold and silver nanoparticles (Dhandayuthapani et al., 2014) . Another study successfully electrospun gluten (with PVA) into nanofibre membranes using various solvents such as ethanol, acetic acid, and 2-propanol (Aziz et al., 2019). The electrospun gluten nanofibre membrane can subsequently be thermochemically carbonised (i.e. pyrolysis) at high temperature and under an inert atmosphere to render them mechanically strong and to enhance the surface area of the individual fibres. It is, therefore, possible to make carbon nanofibre mats from gluten, which would serve as a great candidate for the development of the masks. The performance of masks should be demonstrated in mainly four areas, namely, filter efficiency, flammability, fluid resistance, and differential pressure (Oberg and Brosseau, 2008) . Hence, there is a possibility to establish a knowledge network consisting of the development of green carbon nanofibre mats from gluten and its integration with gluten biopolymer treated with lanosol to create novel fully bio-based masks that possess greater filter efficiency under cyclic or pulsatile breathing conditions. It is envisaged that the developed masks will simultaneously be fire resistant and biodegradable.",

The moisture resistance of gluten could be further increased by the addition of a renewably sourced wet strength additive of polyaminoamide epichlorohydrin (PAE). Hence, electrospun carbon nanofibre mat could be laminated by glycerol plasticised gluten films (containing lanosol) using a hot press that will render the entire structure strong, fire, and moisture resistant. The aforementioned properties should be assessed by mechanical analysis in a universal testing machine (ASTM D638), flammability characterisation in the cone calorimeter (ASTM E1354), vertical burn test (ASTM D6413 Flame resistance of textiles) and water vapour transmission rate by 25 cm 2 VF2201 permeability cups (ASTM D1653). It is envisaged that the laminate structure will have a tensile strength of ca. 15 MPa and the moisture resistance will improve by ca. 38% (Das et al., 2019a; G\u00e4llstedt et al., 2004) . Vacuum forming could be employed to shape the laminate structure into masks. In parallel, filter media adapter should be prepared by injection moulding lanosol added gluten without (or with only a small amount) plasticiser. The electrospun carbon mat should then be affixed onto the adapter, which should be assembled together with the vacuum formed structure to develop the final product of the facemask ( Figure 4) .

The availability of facemasks in societies is particularly important during the surge of novel diseases, like the current COVID-19 when vaccines and anti-viral drugs are things of the future. The provision for the obtainability of the proposed masks will prevent panic, discourage price intensification, and provide potential employment during a pandemic or epidemic. On the other hand, society will be benefited, as the materials used to manufacture the masks will replace petroleum-based plastics, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, since the raw materials for the development of the proposed masks are by-or co-products of industries, it will promote the sustainable use of resources. It will also be beneficial for companies as they will be able to sell their gluten products with higher added value. All the aforementioned aspects will not only aid in stabilising society during an outbreak but also enrich it by enhancing the resiliency to bounce back and thrive after the disaster.",

During disease outbreaks, it is a daunting task to match the supply and demand for masks. The current masks, that are made of non-renewable resources and are nonbiodegradable, are pernicious towards the environment. The disposal of single-use masks made from petroleum-based polymers creates harmful microplastics in the environment. In a recent study, microplastics have been found in Antarctic sea ice for the first time despite being geographically distant from sizeable plastic pollution sources (Kelly et al., 2020) . Thus, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 16 there is an urgent need to increase the disposal efficacy of masks by incorporating raw materials that are inherently innocuous towards the environment and provide superior performance properties, as well.

Pyrolysis or thermochemical conversion is the carbon-neutral (or negative) technique to valorise bio-based resources into carbons. These carbons are extremely resistant to decomposition by chemicals and combustion while being hypo-allergic, as well. Thus, the application of these carbons in developing products (here masks) will concurrently ensure public safety and bestow superior performance properties. On the other hand, although gluten is susceptible to degradation in outdoor environments, they remain intact in less harsh indoor applications. In fact, gluten is very robust in applications that are hydrophobic in nature, e.g. fats and oils. Additionally, the increasing precedence of gluten intolerance and consequently lowered production of wheatbased consumables create motivation for producing plastic products from this industrial sidestream. Furthermore, lanosol, a naturally-occurring compound, that imparts beneficial fire retardancy in gluten also renders it microbe-resistant, which is an important consideration when using gluten for making masks. The entire process of production to distribution of the masks can be made domestic involving minimal transportation that will simultaneously save energy and reduce pollution. The process that can be used to carbonise electrospun gluten nanofibre is often slow pyrolysis, which can potentially offset 2.2 million tons of CO 2 equivalent (Kung et al., 2014) . The resulting carbon from pyrolysis has a considerably lower carbon footprint compared to carbons from petroleum-based sources (Bartocci et al., 2016) . Similarly, gluten has a lower carbon footprint than oil-based polymers and some bio-based polymers (e.g. poly (lactic acid), PLA), as well.",

If the product ends up in the environment via land-fields in countries with less stringent waste-assortment policies, it must be ensured that the degradation products are safer than traditional polymers. Here, gluten represents an advantage, as it would not degrade into microplastics but rather into nitrogen-based components that could even work as a soil conditioner. In conclusion, successful research in mask development will provide societal support in pandemic preparedness by enabling the reduction of infectious disease transmission. Simultaneously, the process of mask development will promote the use of bio-based resources, curtail greenhouse gas emissions and abate the production of harmful microplastics. Thus, this research can contribute to the overcoming of multiple technological and societal challenges on natural resources exploitation in a high-value novel application.",

Electrospun membranes offer high filtration efficiency owing to large porosity (ca. 80%) contributed by concurrently open and interconnected pore structures and a high specific surface area (Zhu et al., 2019). Despite electrospun fibrous membranes possessing highly porous non-woven structure that aids in filtration application, their mechanical strength remains inferior owing to weak fibre-fibre interactions through physical entanglements. This issue can be somewhat alleviated by a partial alignment of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 electrospun fibres (Andersson et al., 2014;Strain et al., 2015). In a previous study, aligned electrospun nanofibers exhibited 250 and 450% improvement in tensile strength and modulus, respectively, in comparison with the randomly oriented nanofibers(Andersson et al., 2012).",
