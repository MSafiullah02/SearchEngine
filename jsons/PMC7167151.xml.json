This study also demonstrated that RSV infection occurred throughout the year, exhibiting a clear seasonal trend.

This result was consistent with that of a previous study in Suzhou,25 but different from that of a study in Changsha.26 The possible explanation for this difference was that the predominant species of HRV varies from location to location and year to year. A few distinct clinical characteristics were observed when different groups of patients were compared. HRV infection was more common than virus\u2010negative cases with a runny nose, throat sore, and wheezing and more prevalent in children with concurrent asthma and immunosuppression.

However, compared with virus\u2010negative cases, more children presented with sputum production, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. A previous study showed that the respiratory rate was an independent risk marker for in\u2010hospital mortality in community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by ADV infection.31 The APACHE II score, one of the most commonly used severity assessment tools for critically ill patients, also provides important prognostic information for ADV in SALRTI. The clinical course of admitted patients in this study showed a substantial proportion of severe illness with higher APACHE II scores in patients, requiring a greater number of therapeutic interventions such as mechanical ventilation (58.2%) during their ICU stay. Radiography could be helpful in the early diagnosis of ADV pneumonia even when lung rales were not evident on auscultation. Severe ADV pneumonia has been frequently described in immunocompromised patients.28 Respiratory infection caused by ADV in immunocompetent patients was usually thought to be mild and self\u2010limited.32 However, 89.1% (49 of 55) of ADV infection cases in this study were immunocompetent. With advancements in modern molecular techniques, ADV has been increasingly found to be involved in sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe CAP in healthy individuals,33, 34 thus warranting attention from clinicians.",

First, this study was conducted at a single center, which might lead to the underestimation of the overall detection rate for the selected viruses. Second, despite testing for a large panel of respiratory viruses, bacterial infection was not evaluated due to the difficulty in obtaining adequate samples for culture. Nevertheless, the role of bacterial pathogens in the development of SALRTI symptoms was taken into consideration.35 Further studies will thus be required to clarify their roles in SALRTI. Third, it should be considered that some respiratory viruses can be shed for long periods of time after infection or detection in asymptomatic children.36 Hence, the investigation of respiratory specimens from asymptomatic children would make the role of these viruses in SALRTI clearer.",
