In the author's laboratory the nonproductive interaction of Syrian hamster cells with human adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) has been studied. Ad12 induces undifferentiated tumors in newborn hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) at high frequency. Ad12 inefficiently enters hamster (BHK21) cells, and only small amounts of viral DNA reach the nucleus. Viral DNA replication and late transcription are blocked. In Ad12-induced tumor cells, multiple copies of viral DNA are chromosomally integrated. The integrated viral DNA becomes de novo methylated. Cellular DNA methylation and transcription patterns in Ad12-transformed cells and in Ad12induced tumor cells are altered. These changes may be related to the oncogenic potential of Ad12 in hamsters. In this chapter, concepts and techniques for the study of the Ad12-hamster cell system are summarized.",

In my laboratory we have studied human adenovirus (Ad) type 12 and its interaction with cells from the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) (3-5). Ad12 undergoes a fully productive cycle in human cells in culture but induces undifferentiated tumors in newborn Syrian hamsters (6-8). In crossing the barrier from human to hamster, Ad12 gains oncogenic potential. There is no evidence that human Ads are involved in human tumorigenesis (9-12). When Ad12 infects human cells, all infected cells are killed in the course of this productive interaction. Hence, there are no surviving cells that could be transformed into tumor cells. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ad12 has not been identified as oncogenic in humans. It cannot be ruled out that Ad12 could be involved, however rarely, in a hit-and-run mechanism in human oncogenesis. This possibility becomes more plausible when one considers that, among hamster tumor cells, revertant cells have been isolated that have lost all of the previously integrated Ad12 genomes but have retained their oncogenic potential. Ad12 infection of hamster cells in culture is completely abortive; the replication block lies before viral DNA replication. The infected cells continue to replicate and show no cytopathic effect. Thus, in rare instances Ad12-infected hamster cells can go on to develop into tumor cells and form tumors in animals.",

As one of the biological consequences of the abortive infection of hamster cells, Ad12 induces undifferentiated tumors in newborn hamsters. (Ad2 fails to do so.

Although this approach was not particularly revealing for understanding the nature of the immediate block for Ad12 replication in BHK21 hamster cells, it yielded the unexpected result that overexpression of the Ad12 pTP gene alone, without enhanced transcription of the E1A genes, led to Ad12 DNA replication. It is conceivable that above-threshold concentrations of Ad12 pTP were capable of exerting previously unknown functions in preparing the hamster cells for nuclear import and replication of Ad12 DNA (even in the absence of large amounts of E1A gene products and beyond the well-known role that pTP can play in the initiation of Ad DNA replication). The data may suggest a novel role of Ad12 pTP in supporting Ad12 DNA nuclear import and replication in a nonpermissive cellular environment.

The sites of viral DNA integration are different from tumor to tumor, except for tumors derived as intraperitoneal seed metastases. Ad12induced tumors are clonal. In all cells derived from one tumor, integration sites are identical. In the Ad12-induced hamster tumor cells, only some of the early Ad12 genes are transcribed at low efficiency. Viral transcription profiles are very similar from tumor to tumor (8). Late genes might be transcribed at extremely low levels, if at all. DNA array analyses of Ad12-induced tumor cells reveal both similarities and differences in cellular transcription patterns among different tumors (8). In an Ad12-induced hamster tumor cell line, about 1 kb of the adjacent cellular DNA showed changes in its methylation profile. Apparently, the insertion of foreign DNA into an established mammalian genome can alter DNA methylation at the site of foreign DNA insertion (38). In addition, foreign DNA insertion into an established genome can elicit alterations in DNA methylation and transcription patterns not only at the site of foreign DNA insertion but also at loci remote from the integration site (15-17).",

Methylation and transcription patterns can be altered in cis and in trans. The author pursues the concept that these changes are critically involved in causing the oncogenic phenotype (43).",

These revertants still retain their oncogenic potential when reinjected into hamsters (36,44) . Hence, mechanisms other than those enacted by proteins encoded in the Ad12 E1 region must play a role at least in the maintenance of the Ad12-induced oncogenic phenotype. These findings have led me to study alterations in the methylation and transcription patterns of cellular genes and repetitive sequences in Ad12-transformed and Ad12-induced tumor cells as alternate important parameters in research on viral oncogenesis (43).",

Cell line T637 exhibits epitheloid morphology and differs distinctly from the parent fibroblastic BHK21 cells. Each T637 cell carries approx 15 copies of Ad12 DNA, which are integrated into the hamster cell genome (14,15,24,25) at a single chromosomal location in a \"pearl necklace\"-like array (23). Upon continuous passage of T637 cells in culture, morphological revertants with a more fibroblastic cell morphology arise. Several of these revertants, designated TR, have been cloned and characterized (47).",

In the revertant TR12, only one copy plus a 3.9-kb fragment from the right terminus of a second copy of Ad12 DNA still reside integrated (26), probably at the same chromosomal location (48), which harbors the 15 copies of Ad12 DNA in cell line T637. The 15 copies of Ad12 DNA in cell line T637 are less intensely methylated than the persisting Ad12 DNA in the revertant cell line TR12 (48). Detailed analyses of the patterns of methylation in the Ad12 integrates in cell line T637 and in its revertant TR12 are now being completed (26). It is conceivable that the extent of DNA methylation of transgenic DNAs, e.g., of the Ad12 genomes in cell lines T637 and TR12, is related to their stability of integration in the recipient genome. Could hypermethylation stabilize foreign DNA integrated into an established mammalian genome like the single copy of Ad12 DNA in cell line TR12?",

The details of some of these methods are described, unless they are well-known, routinely applied procedures used in molecular virology and biology. Among the more routine-based methods, which are described in detail in several of our referenced publications and will not be repeated here, are construction of expression vectors, expression clones, Southern blotting, analyses of newly synthesized viral/cellular DNA in transfected and infected cells, Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (22), preparation of protein extracts slides (8,20) , determination of DNA methylation patterns by methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases like the HpaII-MspI system, HhaI a. o. (15,24,48) , arrays for the study of viral or cellular gene transcription (20), studies on viral DNA integration (8,14,24,25) , and fluorescence in situ hybridization technique (23). The bisulfite reaction (49,50) converts all unmethylated C residues into U residues, which are copied during PCR amplification into T residues, whereas the 5-methyldeoxycytidine (5-mC) residues are refractory to the bisulfite conversion reaction. Thus, a C residue in the eventually determined nucleotide sequence proves the presence of a 5-mC residue in this position in the original genomic nucleotide sequence. All bona fide C residues score as Ts. ",

The latter tumors are most likely of different origins; the former could be seed metastases within the animal's peritoneal cavity. Integration patterns of persisting Ad12 genomes have been determined by restriction cleavage of total intranuclear tumor cell DNA followed by Southern blotting and hybridization to intact Ad12 DNA or to the terminal fragments of the viral DNA (for methods, see refs. 8,24,25,37).

The solution is thereupon neutralized, the DNA ethanol-precipitated, dried, and redissolved in 20 \u03bcL H 2 O. 7. Amplify selected segments in the promoters by PCR with appropriate oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) primers. 8. Clone reaction products into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) after purification by using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and transfect into E. coli XL1BlueMRF' (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) applying standard procedures. 9. Isolate a number of clones and determine the nucleotide sequences with an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer.",
