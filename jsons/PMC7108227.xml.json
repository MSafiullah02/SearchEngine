            "text": "In healthy persons, seasonal influenza usually resolves without consequence, however each year approximately 200 000 hospitalizations and 36 000 deaths occur in the U.S. alone [1]. At greatest risk for secondary bacterial pneumonia are children under the age of 1, adults over 65, pregnant women and individuals of any age with comorbid illnesses [2]. Longstanding evidence for the role of influenza virus in bacterial pneumonia derive from studies of the four well-documented pandemics of the last 100 years. Whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) was the predominant bacterial pathogen associated with both the 1918 and 1968 pandemics, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 44% of deaths in 1957. In the most recent pandemic (2009), interestingly the majority of deaths were now in persons under 65 [3\u2022] with Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and other Gram negative rods identified as causative agents in addition to Spn and S. aureus. Despite the introduction of antibiotics and influenza vaccines in the period between the 1918 and 1957 pandemics, death from secondary bacterial pneumonia remains a significant problem and in fact, in part due to the rapid aging of the U.S. population, associated mortality has increased [2].",

Viral \u2018colds\u2019 predispose to bacterial rhinosinusitis in both adults and children [5, 6] and are among the most common infections seen in primary care [7]. In one prospective longitudinal study in children, 8% of viral URTI were complicated by acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [6]. Spn, H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococci and respiratory anaerobes predominate in both acute and chronic rhinosinusitis. In otitis media, or middle ear infection, virtually any URT virus, as well as some enteroviruses, can predispose the middle ear to invasion by bacteria that normally reside in the nasopharynx (NP) [8, 9]. The predominant bacterial pathogens of OM are Spn, nontypeable H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Whereas the URT viruses are unique in terms of specific histopathology and nature of the evoked immune response, the net effect of all viral infections that lead to OM is compromise of the protective functions of the Eustachian tube and thus there is a bounty of evidence to support the parental lore that \u2018my kid gets a cold and a week later has an ear infection\u2019 [10].",

Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal inherited disease that affects >60 000 persons worldwide is characterized by recurrent and chronic RTI [15] that are exacerbated by infection with common respiratory tract viruses [16]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus are the predominant causative agents of these exacerbations. Both viral and bacterial infections are also associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [17, 18, 19] with COPD expected to rank as the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030 (WHO, http://wwwwhoint/respiratory/copd/burden/en/.2015). A wide variety of URT viruses have been implicated as playing a role in bacterial exacerbations of COPD due to the \u2018usual suspects\u2019: H. influenzae, Spn, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. In further support, a recent study [20] found that 15 days after experimental RV infection of subjects with COPD there was a sixfold increase in both the 16S copy number and a 16% rise in the number of proteobacterial sequences detected in sputum compared to baseline values obtained from sputum collected before RV inoculation, with H. influenzae predominating.",

            "text": "Depending on the virus, bacterial species/strain and experimental system used, viral infection has been shown to promote bacterial adherence and airway colonization via a number of mechanisms. Using a ferret model, Peltola et al. [24] reported that influenza viruses of any subtype increased colonization of the NP by Spn, however only specific subtypes were associated with development of bacterial sinusitis or OM. These findings contribute to our understanding of why bacterial complication rates are greater during seasons when a particular influenza subtype predominates. As to mechanism, influenza viral neuraminidase has been shown to expose host cell receptors used for bacteria adherence due to its sialidase activity which alters epithelial cell surface carbohydrate moieties [1, 23] and is also known to enhance bacterial adherence via activation of TGF-\u03b2 which induces upregulation of expression of fibronectin and integrins to which bacteria bind [25\u2022\u2022]. Moreover, stimulation of type I interferons (IFNs) by influenza virus leads to decreased production of the chemokine CCL2 resulting in impaired recruitment of macrophages (required for pneumococcal clearance) thereby promoting Spn colonization in mice [26]. Influenza virus also primes mice for pneumonia due to S. aureus [27] where both bacterial and viral titers are enhanced during co-infection. The investigators of this latter study hypothesized that viral titers increase after bacterial co-infection due to enhanced virus release from infected cells, but that bacterial titers increase due to alveolar macrophage (AM) impairment [28].",

RSV infection also enhances adherence of P. aeruginosa to both normal and CF epithelial cells [31] and this effect can be extended to Gram positive bacteria. After RSV infection, all Spn serotypes tested showed a significant 2-fold to 10-fold increase in adherence to two cell lines [32]. Similarly, in children, the load of Spn in the NP increased coincident with community acquired pneumonia or infection with either RSV or RV [33]. High NP colonization density with Spn is also observed in adults with viral URTI or HIV infection [34].",

Influenza virus induced depletion of AMs via promotion of apoptosis is well-known to facilitate bacterial superinfection [36, 39]. Via tracking of dye-labeled AMs in a murine model, investigators showed that >90% of resident AMs were lost in the first week after influenza, with the remaining cells demonstrating a necrotic phenotype. Whereas >95% of the initial bacterial challenge dose was cleared within three hours by AM in non-influenza infected mice, in those with influenza co-infection \u223c50% of the bacterial inoculum remained recoverable at the same time point. In addition to reduction in cell numbers via depletion, phagocyte function can also be affected by viral infection. Influenza virus infection of AMs results in low level production of cytokines and chemokines necessary for recruitment and activation of neutrophils [36] and can suppress NADPH oxidase-dependent phagocytic bacterial clearance, thereby enhancing susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection [40].",

Prior to the use of combination anti-retroviral therapy, pneumocystis pneumonia was the most prevalent HIV-associated pulmonary disease, however since broad use of these potent drug combinations, in high income countries this has changed to community acquired bacterial pneumonia and in low income countries, tuberculosis (TB) prevails [44]. The hallmark of an HIV infection is severe depletion of CD4+ T cells which contributes to the fact that persons living with HIV are 20\u201337 times more likely to develop TB than those without HIV [45]. HIV virus has also been reported to facilitate infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis by a variety of effects on macrophage function including upregulated expression of Mycobacterium entry receptors, manipulation of macrophage bactericidal pathways, altered chemotaxis, induction of an immune response that results in a Th1/Th2 imbalance and an impaired tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptotic response, each of which inhibits bacterial clearance [46]. Similarly, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with immune system paralysis, characterized by increased IL-10 and NF\u03ba\u03b2 production, lymphopenia affecting natural killer cells specifically, depletion of IFN-\u03b3 producing T-cells early in infection and dysregulated cytokine production that results in increased tissue damage; each of which may enhance susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection [47]. MeV is another that results in generalized immunosuppression and, in severe cases, can predispose to bacterial pneumonia due to its ability to infect SLAM-positive lymphocytes and dendritic cells, induce T-cell apoptosis, alter lymphocyte trafficking, suppress proliferation of lymphocytes and result in a cytokine imbalance with increased levels of IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13, but suppressed levels of IL-12, the latter of which is associated with a prolonged Th2-biased immune response that leads to suppression of cellular immunity [48].",

Similarly, influenza A virus mediates release of pneumococci from a biofilm [50\u2022\u2022]. Intriguingly, when dispersed in this manner, the pneumococcal transcriptome undergoes tremendous and complex changes [51] with newly released bacteria demonstrating a more virulent phenotype.

Similarly, Hendricks et al. [54\u2022\u2022] showed that viral RTI, with induction of anti-viral interferons, promoted robust biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa via a mechanism of dysregulated iron homeostasis. RSV-infected cells increased apical release of the host iron-binding protein transferrin which was utilized by P. aeruginosa and induced biofilm formation by this microbe. These latter observations suggest a likely mechanism for the clinical observation that links URT virus infection with enhanced P. aeruginosa colonization in chronic diseases such as CF and COPD.",

As an example, Spn was shown to augment human RSV infection in vitro and in vivo [60]. In this study, three pneumococcal strains enhanced RSV infection of primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Further, nasal colonization of cotton rats, followed three days later by intranasal challenge with RSV, resulted in strain-specific enhancement of RSV replication in vivo. Additionally, H influenzae increased the susceptibility and inflammatory response of airway epithelial cells to viral infections [61] via its ability to enhance expression of ICAM-1, which can in turn be used by RV for attachment.",

Whereas viral vaccine development can present some formidable obstacles, vaccination against those viruses associated with increased risk for secondary bacterial infections is believed to be an ideal strategy to mitigate this risk [62]. In addition to prevention, early antiviral therapy (with agents such as rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir) has been proposed for several viral\u2013bacterial co-infections [2, 63]. There is also interest in attempting to abrogate the overly robust host inflammatory response commonly elicited during viral\u2013bacterial co-infection, wherein both controlling bacterial replication and quieting the host immune response has been suggested as an improved treatment strategy. Using a co-infection mouse model of influenza virus and Legionella pneumophila to separate \u2018resistance\u2019 (pathogen detection and elimination) from \u2018tolerance\u2019 (host adaptation to a given level of pathogen burden), Jamieson et al. [64] demonstrated that influenza can promote susceptibility to lethal bacterial co-infection even if that bacterial species is controlled by the host's immune system and suggest that this is due to the host's inability to tolerate tissue damage to the lung. Damjanovic et al. [65] showed that combined treatment with both azithromycin and dexamethasome best improved clinical outcome, bacterial clearance, cytokine reponses and immunopathology in a murine model of dual infection.",
