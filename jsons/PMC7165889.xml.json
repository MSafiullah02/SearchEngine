            "text": "Most members of the Gyrodactylidae are ectoparasitic on actinopterygian fishes and reproduce by hyperviviparity (Cohen 1977) in which a parent worm may concomitantly bear several generations in its uterus. At birth, the progenetic offspring is usually a pregnant worm with subsequent generations of worms already present in its uterus (see Cable & Harris 2002; and references therein). Gyrodactylids have a direct monoxenic life cycle, but contrary to most monogenoid species, transmission is via the preadult/adult stage. A free\u2010swimming ciliated larva, the oncomiracidium of most other monogenoids is absent in their life cycles.",

The limits of the Gyrodactylidae were expanded by Boeger et al. (1994) after phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Oogyrodactylidae was paraphyletic and that its members should be included in the Gyrodactylidae as basal clades.",

If the Gyrodactylidae originated relatively recently in continental South America as suggested by members of its basal clades occurring on loricariid catfishes that date back to only 66 Mya (Berg 1958), how did the viviparous lineage that developed from an oviparous ancestor become so diverse and widely distributed on different host groups in the various geographical regions and environments throughout the world? This paper tests the hypothesis that the viviparous Gyrodactylidae shows high diversification primarily as a consequence of extensive adaptive radiation. We accomplish this by evaluating the four criteria proposed by Brooks & McLennan (1993b) that they hypothesize must be met to identify a case of adaptive radiation:",

The second set of analyses was performed using the estimation of diversification rates using maximum likelihood (ML). In this model, ML estimates the mean diversification rate of a clade based on its age (t) and current species richness (N), by treating clade growth as a pure birth process. The ML estimation (e) of diversification rate is e = ln(N)/t (see Purvis 1996); 95% confidence intervals for each estimate of diversification were calculated by \u2212ln(1\u20130.975 1/N) and \u2212ln(1\u20130.025 1/N) (equations suggested by S.

This may suggest that the diverse group is, in fact, Gyrodactylus, and not the entire lineage of viviparous species. However, taxonomy of the viviparous clade is problematic, and all available evidence suggests that while most of the other generic groups are monophyletic, i.e. supported by well\u2010defined synapomorphies, the same is not true for Gyrodactylus (see Kritsky & Boeger, 2003).

This analysis showed that Gyrodactylus lacks monophyly, with species of Acanthoplacatus and Fundulotrema having developed from respective ancestors within Gyrodactylus. In this analysis, which used molecular data, the clade Gyrdicotylus+Gyrodactyloides appears to be the sister group of the clade including species of Gyrodactylus, Acanthoplacatus and Fundulotrema (Fig. 2).

The droplet serves to secure eggs individually or as clusters on hard surfaces where embryonic development occurs (Kearn 1986, 1998). Hard surfaces may include those provided by the host, such as the exoskeleton of a parasitic copepod in the case of udonellids (Aken\u2019Ova & Lester 1996) and the dermal bones of catfishes in oviparous gyrodactylids (Boeger et al. 1994); species of Acanthocotylidae may utilize other substrates such as sand grains or rocks or the eggs may be retained on the body of the parent worm (Macdonald & Llewellyn 1980; Kearn 1993). In all of these families, the ecloded larva lacks cilia and thus is incapable of actively seeking a new host. [It is not clear if the morphological stage that eclodes from the eggs of udonellids, acanthocotylids and oviparous gyrodactylids is a semaphoront comparable to the oncomiracidum or represents a stage more advanced in ontogeny. The term \u2018larva\u2019 is used to represent the stage of ontogenetic development that eclodes from the egg regardless of developmental stage.] It either autoinfests the host of its parent or is passively transmitted. In the latter case, natural hosts are usually demersal, and/or either the larva or the adult parasite may show behavioural adaptations that increase the chance of transmission (see Kearn 1998; Cable et al. 2002).",

This hypothesis is supported by the limited array of host groups parasitized by members of the Udonellidae (caligid copepods), Acanthocotylidae (demersal/gregarious rays, teleosts and agnathans) and the oviparous Gyrodactylidae (demersal/armored catfishes).

The model suggests that hosts harbouring one (or more) genetically diverse species of viviparous Gyrodactylidae have ample opportunities for infesting other sympatric host species (1st level, upper portion). In most cases, these host transfers result in extinction of the invading lineage because of the inability of the invader or its descendants to adapt to the environmental conditions imposed by the new host (2nd level, upper portion). However, should the invader possess appropriate genetic and/or morphological attributes for compatibility, the parasite rapidly colonizes the newly invaded host, undergoing genetic drift by parthenogenesis followed by sexual reproduction to form a less genetically diverse, albeit adapted, population. Features that allowed successful host switching quickly become fixed in the parasite population. Subsequent mutation and selection eventually results in genetic diversification and speciation as age of the new relationship increases (3rd level, upper portion); cospeciation between the new parasite lineage and that of the acquired host could subsequently occur. This scenario of host switching followed by peripheral speciation in other hosts is often repeated during development of respective gyrodactylid clades (4th level, upper portion). A similar scenario also occurs if a host and its parasites disperse geographically (lower portion of Fig. 4). Initial reduction in genetic and/or morphological variability due to inability of most variants to survive in the new environment occurs. However, as the parasite\u2010host system ages in the new area, the same mechanisms described above will promote variability, host switching and peripheral speciation among gyrodactylid lineages.",

That the invading ancestor was marine and oviparous is supported by the phylogenetic hypothesis of Boeger & Kritsky (2001), who indicated that all other gyrodactylidean families (Tetraonchoididae, Bothitrematidae, Anoplodiscidae, Udonellidae, and Acanthocotylidae), which include only oviparous monogenoids parasitic on marine hosts, are either basal to or form the sister group of the Gyrodactylidae. Berg (1958) indicates that the earliest known fossils of loricariid catfishes (hosts to members of the basal oviparous groups of Gyrodactylidae) date back to only 66 Mya. By this time, South America was isolated from Africa as well as from all other continental landmasses. While oviparous gyrodactylids from non\u2010Neotropical hosts would be expected if the Gyrodactylidae had originated prior to the fragmentation of Gondwanaland, no oviparous species is known from native hosts outside the Neotropics.
