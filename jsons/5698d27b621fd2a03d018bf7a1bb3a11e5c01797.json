It is vital that every patient has access to nutritional care as a part of primary healthcare services, even if social distancing measures are adopted. Therefore, we propose a simple remote nutritional screening tool and practical guidance for nutritional care in primary practice, and their implementation into telemedicine processes and digital platforms suitable for healthcare providers. The acronym for the tool is R-MAPP, as for Remote e Malnutrition APP, while the tool will be available also as an app. This protocol consists of two simple validated clinical tools for identifying nutritional risk and loss of muscle mass and function eMalnutrition Universal Screening Tool ('MUST') and SARC-F (5-item questionnaire: Strength, Assistance with walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs and Falls) -and additional practical guidance on nutritional interventions for family physicians.",

Also, chronic patients with previously prescribed nutritional support should be re-screened, monitored and their nutritional therapy should continue to be prescribed where indicated. Many consulting services can be done remotely by ensuring good digital communication channels between patients, family physicians and hospital physicians or specialists. National health services and health insurance funds should enable the use and reimbursement of referrals for a specialist's services that do not require the patient to physically attend the hospital. Such model is present in Croatia since the year 2015. The Spanish NHS has gradually included modality of e-consultation in different Spanish regions in primary care and hospital specialists during the last decade, and it has been recently included by the insurance companies during COVID -19 pandemics.",

For obese patients or those with sarcopenic obesity, ideal body weight should be used to calculate requirements. In terms of protein, caution is needed in patients with severe kidney disease (e. GFR30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and it should not be higher than 0.6 g/kg BW/d unless on dialysis which leads to higher requirements.",

Sarcopenia may be severe in post-ICU COVID-19 patients that present with ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) [31] . While there is no reliable pharmacologic intervention for sarcopenia, conservative measures are the mainstay of the treatment. These measures include physical therapy and/or resistance training together with nutrition support: supplementation with protein (1e1.5 g/kg/d), specific anabolic amino acids or their metabolites (b-hydroxy-b-methylbutyrate, leucine), and vitamin D (800e1000 IU/d). In sarcopenic obesity, we recommend an energy restricted diet, accompanied by supplementation with protein and the other key (pharmaco)nutrients, an approach that is even more challenging than the in case of malnutrition related sarcopenia [40, 41] . Supplementation with protein and key nutrients can be performed by use of oral nutritional supplements (medical nutrition) and/or food supplements. Duration and the appropriate dosage should be adapted individually for every patient.",

In COVID-19 patients, postextubation dysphagia can be observed, and could be extended for to up to 21 days after prolonged intubation particularly in older persons [31] . Clinical nutrition, which entails different modalities of feeding, from oral diet therapy to specialized artificial nutritional support (enteral or parenteral), is essential for the management of dysphagia. Changes in the consistency (modified texture) of foods and liquids and use of oral enteral formulas with adjusted texture 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64 may ease the ingestion process and help reduce the risk of aspiration [40] , while enteral tube feeding should be considered for individuals with an unsafe swallow. Another common clinical condition observed with older age is chronic wounds and decubital ulcers. Energy requirements for malnourished geriatric patients with chronic wounds are 30e40 kcal/kg BW/day, while protein intakes should be between 1.2 and 1.5 g/kg BW/d [43] . Some specific nutrients are important for wound healing and therefore pharmaconutrients like arginine, glutamine, zinc, b-hydroxy-b-methylbutyrate (HMB), and vitamin C should be considered, as well as high intake of proteins [44] .",
