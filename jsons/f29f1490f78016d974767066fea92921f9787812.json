As shown in figure 1, a worldwide search revealed a first significant increase in the search term \"wash hands\", culminating on March 13. \"Social distancing\" rises from March 9 to a first peak on March 22 and a second peak on March 30. Furthermore, terms may reflect an increased concern or fear of infection among the population, such as \"COVID-19 symptoms\". Searches have increased since February 23, 2020 and peaked on March 23. After the name COVID-19 was introduced in early February, the curve of the search term for symptoms of COVID-19 fits well with the course of the more general term \"coronavirus\", which Strzelecki shows in the representation of a second wave of interest [Strzelecki, 2020] . \"Panic buying\" was used as a substitute marker for concerns about supply shortages and generated an early peak on March 15 (figure 1*).",
