Three days later (day 5), he visited another clinic because of the worsening of his previous symptoms, headache, and sore throat. He underwent chest X-ray examination and blood test resulted in negative findings. On day 9, he was found lying on the floor with consciousness disturbance. He was immediately transferred to our hospital by ambulance. During emergency transport, he presented with transient generalized seizures for about a minute.",

Blood investigation showed an increased white cell count, neutrophil dominant, relatively decreased lymphocytes, increased C-reactive protein. Subsequent investigations included systemic CT demonstrating no evidence of brain edema. The chest CT showed that there was small ground glass opacity on the right superior lobe and both sides of the inferior lobe. On a further lumbar puncture examination, his cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless, and the initial pressure was greater than 320 mmH2O. The CSF cell count was 12/\u03bcL\u201310 mononuclear and 2 polymorphonuclear cells without red blood cells. Anti-HSV 1 and varicella-zoster IgM antibodies were not detected in serum samples. The RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a nasopharyngeal swab and CSF because we assumed that a SARS-CoV-2 was involved in the outbreak. Although the specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab, it was detected in CSF (Supplementary Table 1).",

Favipiravir had been administered via nasogastric tube for 10 days since day 2. Brain MRI was performed 20 h after admission to the ICU (Figure 1\n). Diffusion weighted images (DWI) showed hyperintensity along the wall of inferior horn of right lateral ventricle. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed hyperintense signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus with slight hippocampal atrophy. Contrast-enhanced imaging showed no definite dural enhancement. These findings indicated right lateral ventriculitis and encephalitis mainly on right mesial lobe and hippocampus. A differential diagnosis was considered to be hippocampal sclerosis accompanying post convulsive encephalopathy. Besides, T2-weighted image showed pan-paranasal sinusitis.",
