Kala-azar is a severe and frequently lethal disease if untreated after the onset of symptoms. In these regions, it results from canid zoonoses. These parasites are found exposed on the skin of foxes, wild canids and dogs, and transmitted to humans through a sand fly's bite. Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is then a re-emergent canid zoonoses, the epidemiological control of which involves: the elimination of seropositive infected dogs, insecticide treatment within domestic and peri-domestic habitations, and the systematic treatment of human cases [1]. Brazil is one of the four countries responsible for 90% of the total human cases (500,000 all over the world) [1]. As a tool for epidemiological control, the killing of seropositive dogs is widely practised in Brazil and China but unacceptable in Europe. Canine surveillance programs are very laborious, expensive and require continual vigilance [1] and sensitive serological diagnostic methods [2], [3], [4] to be effective. Furthermore, since many seropositive infected dogs are asymptomatic, owner compliance is complicated [1] even though the infectivity of asymptomatic dogs to sand flies has already been proven [5].",

Reports about an increase in survival rate [9] and a possible cure potential [10], however, stimulated research into dog therapy against ZVL. Treatment of infected dogs is now usual practise in Europe and is now being adopted in Brazil. Dogs therapies are still not recommended by WHO since both the human and canine treatment are performed with the same drugs and this fact raises the risk of rise in number of drug-resistant parasites [11]. Treatment promotes a clinical cure and better quality of life but amastigotes remain present [12], [13] meaning that dogs might remain infectious for sand flies, even several months after treatment [5], [14]. The presence of latent infections in dogs is typical and important in maintaining the long-term presence of the parasite in endemic regions [15].",

It is the first registered vaccine against leishmaniasis. It is composed of the FML (Fucose-Mannose Ligand) antigen of Leishmania donovani and Riedel de Haen saponin which contains the QS21 and deacylated saponins of Quillaja saponaria as the main adjuvant components [21], [22], [23], [24]. This formulation obtained under laboratory conditions and proved to be safe protective and highly immunogenic for hamsters [25], mice [26] and dogs [27], [28]. In a Brazilian area endemic for both human and dog visceral leishmaniasis, recent Phase III trials of efficacy using the FML-saponin in dogs induced 92% [27] and 95% [28] protection for dogs exposed to the disease (76% and 80% of vaccine efficacy, respectively). Protection induced by the FML-QuilA vaccine lasted up to 3.5 years after vaccination. At this time, vaccinees showed higher seropositivities and intradermal reactions, with no Leishmanial DNA nor parasites in bone marrow punctures. The FML-QuilA vaccine, then, induced a significant, long-lasting and strong protective effect against canine visceral leishmaniasis in the field [28]. On the other hand, dogs which received saline were PCR positive for Leishmania DNA, had amastigotes in bone marrow and FML-serology with no intradermal reaction [28].",

The impressive protection achieved by the FML-vaccines in the field Phase III assays [27], [28] and by Leishmune\u00ae to date [22] raise the perspective of their use in immunotherapeutic canine trials. This hypothesis is further supported by the recent results showing that the FML-saponin vaccine, among few others [31], [32], has been shown to be immunotherapeutic in mice [33] and in seropositive asymptomatic dogs from Brazilian endemic areas [34].",

The treated dogs showed stable anti-FML IgG1 levels, increasing IgG2 levels and 79\u201395% of positive DTH response, during the whole experiment [34]. Twenty-two months after complete vaccination, no deaths due to visceral leishmaniasis were recorded and 90% of the dogs were still asymptomatic, healthy and parasite free [34]. The dogs remain healthy up until five years after initial vaccination. On the other hand, 37% (17/46 dogs) kala-azar deaths were recorded in a control group that received no treatment during the 22-month period. All these dogs were FML-seropositive and asymptomatic at the beginning of the study. Our results indicate that the FML-vaccine was effective in the immunotherapy against visceral leishmaniasis of asymptomatic infected dogs. Normal proportions of CD4 and CD21 lymphocytes were detected in PBMC by FACS analysis, in dogs submitted to immunotherapy, suggesting their non infectious condition. As expected, treated animals showed significantly increased percentages of CD8 lymphocytes typical for a Quillaja saponin (QuilA) vaccine treatment [34].",

All dogs were healthy and seronegative for Leishmania antibodies in the FML-ELISA assay [35] and were further experimentally infected, by the i.v. route, with 2 \u00d7 108 amastigotes obtained from Leishmania (L.) chagasi MHOM/BR/1972/BH46 from infected hamster's spleens [36]. All animals became seropositive to the FML antigen, between months 5\u20136. Randomization of each one of the six litters was performed by draft in order to divide them into two balanced groups. One half of each litter received the saline control and the second half the vaccine. The saline control was then composed of: dogs 1,2,3 from family A; 7,8,9,10 from family B; 15,17 from family C; 20, 21 from family D; and dog 25 from family E. The vaccinated group included: dogs 4,5,6 from family A; 11,12,13 from family B; 14,16 from family C; 19,22,23 from family D; and dog 24 from family E. The control group was treated with sterile 0.9% NaCl saline solution, while the immunotherapy group received the Leishmune\u00ae enriched vaccine containing 1.5 mg of the FML industrialized antigen (Fort Dodge Animal Health) and 1 mg of Riedel de Haen saponin. The vaccine was given in three doses, injected through the sc route on the back, with a 20\u201330 days interval (essentially months 6, 7, 8). This formulation differed in adjuvant concentration from the Leishmune\u00ae vaccine formulation which contains only 0.5 mg of the saponin and is industrialized and registered in Brazil as a prophylactic vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (Patent: INPI number: PI1100173-9 (18.3.97). Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). All dogs were monitored for the following parameters: anti-FML IgG antibody levels, delayed type of hypersensitivity (DTH) against LD1S f/t promastigote lysate antigen, PBMC lymphocyte phenotyping and clinical signs. Animals were clinically evaluated on a monthly basis for: alopecia; onycogryphosis; cachexia; anorexia; isolation; apathy; skin lesions, popliteal and cervical lymph node enlargement, and loss of weight. A score system of clinical signs of infection was based on a series of factors including: the diameters of small (up to 1 cm), medium (1\u20131.5 cm), and large (\u22652 cm) lymph nodes. Weight loss was also considered mild (MW = 0\u20132 kg) or severe (SW = 2\u20135 kg). While to detection of alopecia; onycogryphosis; cachexia; anorexia; isolation; apathy or skin lesions was attributed value = 1, the scores for normal undetectable, small, medium, and enlarged lymph nodes were 0,1,2,3, respectively. Also, a score of 2 was attributed to mild loss of weight and 3 to a severe loss of weight.",

(L.) chagasi BH46 obtained from hamsters spleens. The animals were monitored monthly for their anti-FML IgG antibodies (Fig. 1A and B). Until month 5 after infection, no antibodies were detected; between month 5\u20136 (150\u2013180 days of infection), all animals started to give positive results in the FML-ELISA assay (cut-off Abs 492\u03b7m = 0,450) and in month 6, the first clinical signs were noted. At this point, the enriched-Leishmune\u00ae vaccine was injected in the immunotherapy group (months 6, 7 and 8), while the control group received only saline. Starting from month 7, soon after the first vaccine dose, and as expected for a saponin-containing vaccine, a rapid increase of IgG anti-FML antibodies was observed in vaccinees, while control dogs showed lower and stable titters (Fig. 1A). The ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences both between times (p\n < 0.0001) and between treatments (p\n < 0.0001). Differences started in month 5 (Student-Newman-Keuls method-SPSS for windows). In Fig. 1B, we observed the evolution of the individual anti-FML IgG absorbencies in each saline-treated control dog. Four control dogs (number 1,2,3 and 10) turned to seronegative at month 7, indicating the control and spontaneous resolution of infection. We further determined the isotype of the antibodies produced against the FML antigen in each group of dogs. Fig. 1C shows the IgG2 (TH1 T-cell response) and IgG1 (TH2 T-cell response) absorbencies with regard to anti-FML antibodies. The animals vaccinated with the enriched-Leishmune\u00ae vaccine, that induced high levels of specific IgG antibodies (Fig. 1A) also showed increased IgG2 and IgG1 responses over the saline control. Both groups showed the same antibody levels by the time of infection (month 0). While immunotherapy treatment induced a higher and stable IgG2 response in vaccines (TH1 type of immune response), the IgG2 response decreased in the untreated controls with the progression of infection. On the other hand, the IgG1 antibodies diminished after vaccination and showed a mild trend to increase in the untreated infected animals (TH2 immune response) (Fig. 1C).",

On the other hand, the in vivo parasite amplification of blood, bone marrow and lymph node samples in hamsters (months 6 and 11), and the bone marrow PCR analysis (month 9) showed higher sensitivity (Table 2). We recorded as positive, hamsters infected with dog samples 90 days before that either died of visceral leishmaniasis or had parasites in spleen or liver. Taking into the account the proportion of positive results among the total of evaluations, the saline treated group showed a higher percent of parasite evidence (35/93; 37.6%) than the Leishmune\u00ae treated group (28/96; 29.2%) (Table 3) indicating that for the saline treated animals the disease was in progress, whereas the vaccinated animals controlled their parasitaemia and probably their potential infectiousness to insects. This difference however, was not statistically significant. Of note, dogs 1,2,3 from the saline control and dogs 4 and 5 from the vaccinated group which did not show any parasite evidence belong to the same family and litter suggesting a possible genetic background for the resistance of these animals.",

Indeed, using a high inoculum (2 \u00d7 108 amastigotes), considered two million times higher than that delivered in nature [19], [43], three untreated control dogs (1,2 and 3) and three vaccined animals (dogs 4,5 and 6) only developed a mild infection. The heterogeneity in the outcome of canine visceral leishmaniasis infection and the spontaneous remission is well described in the literature, so finding dogs that were asymptomatic and spontaneously cured was expected to occur in both groups [2], [5], [42]. Interestingly, dogs 1,2,3,4,5,6 belong to the same family and the same litter, suggesting a genetically based resistance to the infection (recently proved in dogs [42], [43]), more than the low infectivity of the Leishmania strain. Being aware of that fact, we purposely randomized the SRD animals according to their family origin, distributing half of each litter in the saline control and the other half in the vaccine group. The determination of which dog composed each group was done by draft. This natural resistance did not impede however, the significant increase in the symptomatology and decrease in Leishmania-specific CD4+ counts of the saline controls, whose averages fell outside the IC95% of vaccinated dogs disclosing the protective effect of the immunotherapy treatment. Ramiro et al. [19] justified the use a higher inoculum to assure that the lack of infection in protected animals is due to the immune response achieved by vaccination and not to natural resistance to the disease. The absence of severe clinical signs and deaths, both in this investigation and in the work of Ramiro et al. [19], and the presence of animals resistant to infection, prove however, that the high inoculum does not itself guarantee susceptibility. This should be probably associated to natural inoculation through the phlebotomine bite [44] or to the variation in dog's genetic background associated to the described NRAMP1 gene [42] and/or the MHC classII DLA-DRB1 genotype, significantly associated with levels of anti-Leishmania IgG and parasite status assessed by PCR [43]. In any case, the mongrel dogs participating in the present Phase IIa trial indeed represent the susceptibility of a heterogenic dog population to the disease found in larger natural populations.",

The potential effect of the FML (Fucose-Mannose Ligand)-vaccine on immunotherapy of canine visceral leishmaniasis was first demonstrated in 21 L. (L.) chagasi naturally infected dogs that were seropositive to FML but completely asymptomatic at the beginning of vaccination [34]. While 37% of the untreated controls died, the vaccinees remained 90% asymptomatic, healthy, with normal CD4+ and CD21+ lymphocyte proportions until month 22, after vaccination [34]. These dogs also received the FML-saponin preparation (1 mg adjuvant) and remained healthy and asymptomatic for five years (unpublished results). We used an increased saponin concentration based on our previous effective results of immunotherapy in the murine model [33].",

            "text": "Different from previous results of experimental infection with L. (L.) donovani and natural infection with L. (L.) chagasi (90\u2013120 days) [18], [34], [45], [46], the anti-Leishmania antibodies in this investigation only became evident between 150 to 180 days. The literature estimates that seroconversion in nature occurs on average 94 days after infection and it takes more 105 days for the dog to become symptomatic and infectious for the insect vector (199 days) [2]. Our results indicate lower virulence of the L. (L.) chagasi strain that showed a delay in seroconversion [46]. Significant correlations however were found in untreated dogs, between the increase in anti-FML antibodies and the increase in clinical signs which itself is correlated with the increase in number of parasitological evidence and the decrease in Leishmania-specific CD4+ lymphocyte proportions. Both variables are highly associated with infectiousness to phlebotomine [2], [40]. This means that, in spite of use of a strain that shows a delay in seroconversion, the dog's infection simulated the natural infection in the field. On the other hand, after vaccination, a rapid and significant increase of IgG anti-FML antibodies was observed in vaccinees, as described first for the immunoprophylactic vaccine [27], [28] and as was expected for the use of a vaccine composed of QuilA saponin [47] and glycoproteins antigens [26], [48]. The higher anti-FML IgG2 response detected in dogs treated with the Leishmune\u00ae together with the reduction of the IgG1 antibodies indicate the induction of a protective/curative TH1 response [2], [19], [34], [49], [50], [51]. The response induced by Leishmune\u00ae was similar to that achieved in naturally infected dogs after immunotherapy with a FML-saponin vaccine, [34] and seems to be stronger than that reported by Ramiro et al. [19] for dogs vaccinated with LACK formulations, which only showed higher IgG2/IgG1 ratios between days 28\u201342, after infection. In the present study the maximal IgG2 predominance was sustained from month 9 to month 15.",

Although the clinical cure was not complete in the vaccinated dogs, the accumulated scores were much higher in untreated than in treated animals.

[19] used a prime boost with DNA plasmid and recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the LACK antigen (rVV-LACK) from L. (L.) infantum in dogs challenged with L. (L) infantum. IgG antibodies and clinical symptoms were found in 5/5 untreated controls, 4/5 LACK-DNA and 2/5 LACK-DNA + rVV-LACK treated dogs. The rVV-LACK formulation was also the best in decreasing liver and spleen parasite burden and enhancing in vitro lymphocyte proliferation against the LACK antigen. This group however, produced coincidental IFN\u03b3 and IL4 peaks that disappeared one month after infection [19]. The statistical significance of these results is however not available, probably due to the small number of animals. Rafati et al. [20] used a prime boost with DNA and recombinant protein of the Cistein proteinases a and b of L. (L.) infantum in combination with Montanide 720 and CPG on ten dogs further challenged with L. (L.) infantum. The vaccinated group showed IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 antibody synthesis, stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation, IFN\u03b3/IL10 secretion and DTH response enhanced over controls, with less positive results in culture and PCR for Leishmania DNA. No clinical signs were reported in neither group, probably due to the very low infective challenge (5 \u00d7 106 promastigotes) [20]. The main contribution of that study was the analysis of the immunogenicity of the vaccine and not of the efficacy. The immunogenic potential detected in the formulation was expected for the use of Montanide 720 and CpG sequences. Knowing the highly heterogenic degree of infection observed in canine visceral leishmaniasis [42], [43] no significant conclusion might be drawn from the study which used ten vaccinated dogs and only two control untreated dogs.",

Each prophylactic Leishmune\u00ae dose contains about 90 \u03bcg of QS21 saponin, as the main adjuvant active compound [24]. The therapeutic formula then includes 180 \u03bcg of QS21/dose. The use of 100 \u03bcg of QS21 showed perfect tolerability in mice vaccinated with the FML-saponin vaccine [26], [23], [55], [56]. Also, doses of 100 \u03bcg are considered tolerable and now recommended for use in humans submitted to melanoma immunotherapy [57]. A Babesia canis vaccine composed of parasite antigen and 1 mg of QuilA adjuvant that contains about 400 \u03bcg of QS21 Quillaja saponaria saponin [26] was reported [58]. This vaccine contains 2.2 times the QS21 concentration of the immunotherapic Leishmune\u00ae vaccine and led to 100% local pain, 20% of anorexia, 33% of listlessness and 93% of swelling. In spite of these results, its use has been reported since 1992 [58].",

No dead by anaphylaxis occurred, and only two dogs (0,1%) showed allergic reactions (facial oedema and itching) [29]. Transient alopecia on injection site occurred in only 0.28% of the dogs with total recovery and no need of treatment. All the mild adverse events in response to Leishmune\u00ae injection were transient and disappeared before the injection of the following vaccine dose [29]. In spite of the double adjuvant concentration used in the present work, the number of dogs showing pain (25%) and apathy (11%) were lower. No deaths, anaphylaxis, anorexia, allergy, vomit or diarrhoea events were detected indicating that reactogenicity did not increase in a dose-response. The difference in the reactogenicity of the 0.5 and the 1 mg vaccine might be related to the different evaluation protocols. While the 0.5 mg formulation was evaluated on a daily basis for 14 days after each injection by the dog owners [29], the immunotherapeutic vaccine was evaluated in experimental kennel dogs, by veterinarians on day 1,2,4 and 9 after each dose. Also, in the vaccination with the 0.5 mg vaccine, different sites for injections were used showing that subcutaneous injections in the neck induced less reactions [29]. In the present study, the neck was the injection site. This might explain the detected lower reactogenicity reported. In both studies, most of the adverse effects were mild and mostly disappeared within five days after injection. The only increased adverse effect of the immunotherapeutic formulation was the local swelling (from 15.9% in the 0.5 mg vaccine to 63% in the 1 mg vaccine), characteristic of the expected inflammatory response subsequent to the Quillaja saponaria saponin injection [23], [26], [58], which was in spite of that, mostly reverted by the fourth day after injection.",

The vaccine was considered tolerable and non toxic [29]. No other studies about dog vaccines reported such information. Of note and different from [29], here we report on the analysis of a new experimental vaccine. Regarding the cost-benefit analysis, one must keep in mind that treatment with the 1 mg saponin vaccine might be worthwhile, for its therapeutic potential and in spite of some undesirable side effects, especially given that zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is a fatal human and canine disease increasing in endemic areas and whose epidemiological control involves culling and euthanasia of Leishmania-infected dogs.",
