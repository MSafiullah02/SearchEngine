Virus emergence requires overlap between host populations, alterations in virus genetics to permit infection of new hosts, and adaptation to novel hosts such that between-host transmission is sustainable, all of which are the purview of the fields of ecology and evolution. A firm understanding of the ecology of viruses and how they evolve is required for understanding how and why viruses emerge. In this paper, I address the evolutionary mechanisms of virus emergence and how they relate to virus ecology. I argue that, while virus acquisition of the ability to infect new hosts is not difficult, limited evolutionary trajectories to sustained virus between-host transmission and the combined effects of mutational meltdown, bottlenecking, demographic stochasticity, density dependence, and genetic erosion in ecological sinks limit most emergence events to dead-end spillover infections. Despite the relative rarity of pandemic emerging viruses, the potential of viruses to search evolutionary space and find means to spread epidemically and the consequences of pandemic viruses that do emerge necessitate sustained attention to virus research, surveillance, prophylaxis, and treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Despite their limited genetic repertoires and typically specific host tropisms, viruses have a remarkable ability to infect new, often highly unrelated host types. The incidence and spread of novel viruses in host populations is termed virus emergence. In recent years, the incidence of newly identified viruses in human populations appears to be increasing, but whether this is a consequence of improved detection or more emergence events is a topic of considerable debate. [1] [2] [3] Nevertheless, there are some general patterns for virus emergence. Emergence events typically occur when novel host and reservoir populations experience significant changes in range, demographics, aggregation and dispersal behavior, contact rates, environmental and climatic conditions, or vector distributions. In humans, there appear to be several hotspots for emergence, typically regions of high human population activity and density. These emergence hotspots include the Eastern United States, Western Europe, Japan, and Southeastern Australia. 3 Sources of emerging viruses tend to be phylogenetically closely related organisms. For example, zoonotic viruses of wildlife are overrepresented among the emerging human viruses. 3 In addition, there is a tendency for emerging viruses to have RNA genomes. 4 This pattern may be a consequence of the high evolvability of RNA viruses. 5 Despite these generalities, efforts to predict potential emerging viruses have not progressed as fast as hoped.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 475, "end": 478, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 479, "end": 482, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 483, "end": 486, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1038, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1219, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1296, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1373, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Mechanistically, virus emergence is a three-step process.

This error-prone replication can produce viral quasispecies (i.e., vast populations of closely related genotypes). 5, 11 Although sequence spaces are unfathomably large (the sequence space of a 10-kb virus genome is 4 10,000 ), the immense virus populations can contain many alternative variants; thus, viruses can rapidly sample sequence space and locate high fitness combinations of mutations. 6 The quasispecies nature of viruses may facilitate virus emergence. The initial gain-of-function mutations permitting infection of novel hosts tend to be associated with host entry, namely the binding of the virus to a specific molecule on the host cell's surface. In many cases, changes in cell tropism can be accomplished through a few (or even one) nucleotide substitutions.

Given small viral genomes and large population sizes, the number of potential host range mutants in a sample can be surprisingly large. A 10-kb genome has a maximum of 3 \u00d7 10 4 potential independent single mutants, which is well below the average population size of viruses. Given that a considerable proportion of these mutants are not biologically feasible owing to lethal mutations, 76 two or three rounds of replication of a single virus can generate every possible viable mutation one step away from the parental genotype. A simple thought experiment illustrates the ease of generating host range mutants in high mutation rate viruses. A single sneeze can expel 20,000 droplets, with each droplet containing 1000 virus particles. 77 Assuming that a single nucleotide substitution A\u2192T in a 10-kb genome provides the ability to infect a novel host, there could be 10,000 virus particles in that sneeze that possess mutations allowing them to infect a novel host. Moreover, while most virus mutations are highly deleterious, even lethal, 76 host range-expanding mutations often incur minimal impacts on viral fitness on native hosts, although this is by no means universal. [78] [79] [80] [81] Since the effectiveness of purifying selection is proportional to the strength of selection, one consequence is that slightly deleterious mutations may persist for long periods in quasispecies swarms in primary host populations. 82, 83 Due to genetic drift and other stochastic processes, their frequencies in host populations could even increase. In our example, 10,000 host range mutants per sneeze could be a significant underestimate of the number of particles able to infect a novel host.

[86] [87] [88] While recombination frequencies vary considerably, some DNA viruses have extremely high rates of recombination. In one study of cauliflower mosaic virus, 53.8% of the genomes recovered after a single passage were recombinants. 89 In the brome mosaic virus, practically every virus is a recombinant. 90 Nonreplicative recombination uses enzyme-mediated breakage-repair mechanisms, similar to DNA-based genomes. 91 Thus, the function(s) of recombination in DNA viruses may be similar to the hypothesized functions of recombination in other clonal organisms. That is, recombination in DNA viruses may serve to repair DNA, remove mutations, break down linkage disequilibrium, and maintain genome integrity. 92 Moreover, recombination may allow viruses to capture and use host-encoded genes to manipulate hosts and increase infectivity (Fig. 2) . 93 For example, the Epstein-Barr herpesvirus likely acquired, via recombination, a homolog of human interleukin-10, called BRCFI. BRCFI inhibits the synthesis of antiviral cytokines and stimulates the production of B cells in which the virus replicates. 94 In contrast to DNA virus recombination, RNA virus recombination mainly occurs through a different mechanism, termed copy-choice recombination, although some RNA virus recombination can occur through nonreplicative mechanisms. [95] [96] [97] In copy-choice recombination, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase molecule switches from one template RNA molecule to another during the process of genome replication (Fig. 2 ). If the two templates contain divergent genetic information, these differences can be recombined into the same RNA molecule. Recombination frequency varies widely among the RNA viruses. This variation in recombination frequency may reflect the diverse nature of RNA genomes. RNA virus genomes may consist of +ssRNA, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA), or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Recombination is rare in -ssRNA viruses, 95 but frequent in retroviruses, particularly in HIV, where recombination rates can exceed mutation rates. 98 Recombination frequencies in the +ssRNA viruses are mixed. Some groups show high recombination rates (e.g., Picornaviridae), while, in others, recombination is rare or nonexistent (e.g., some Flaviviridae and Leviviridae). 84 Some of these differences may derive from mechanistic constraints on recombination. For example, -ssRNA viruses are often bound in ribonucleoprotein complexes, which limits opportunities for hybridization between complemen-tary sequences. Encapsidation of dsRNA viruses in nucleocapsids during genome replication prohibits recombination. However, in other cases, the rarity of recombination may have more to do virus and host life history. For example, recombination has not been observed among the tick-borne flaviviruses. Ticks usually feed once during each life history stage (as larva, nymph, and adult). Therefore, the likelihood of an infected tick feeding on a host infected by a different virus strain is low. Since recombination requires coinfection of the same host by multiple virus strains, the rarity of tick coinfection may explain the failure to detect recombination among the tick-borne flaviviruses. 99 Virus recombination has been shown to facilitate virus emergence. 88,100-109 A recombination event may provide a host receptor gene with a new genetic background, providing the recombinant virus with the ability to gain access into a host cell without triggering host active immunity. For example, the spike glycoprotein (host receptor) gene of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, an upperrespiratory virus of chickens, was replaced by a spike gene from an unknown source. 101 The chimeric virus gained the ability to infect and cause disease in turkeys, but as an enteric, not respiratory, virus.

[147] [148] [149] This virus contained nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M), and nonstructural protein (NS) segments from a swine influenza strain; hemagglutinin (H3), neuramidase (N2), and polymerase subunit (PB1) segments from the seasonal human influenza strain; and polymerase subunits (PB2, PA) from an avian influenza strain. 147 Subsequently, this virus reassorted with and acquired hemagglutinin (H1) and neuramidase (N1) segments from classical swine influenza. 147, 150, 151 In 2009, this H1N1 swine strain reassorted with an avian-derived H1N1 swine strain from Europe, acquired the M and N1 segments, and subsequently shifted hosts and emerged in human populations (Fig. 3 ).

An adaptive landscape is defined as a network of genotypes connected by mutational paths. 153, 154 This network of genotypes is visualized as a three-dimensional topology of peaks and valleys corresponding to the fitness values of the associated genotypes. The relevance of adaptive landscapes for virus emergence stems from the fact that most emergence events require a virus to significantly increase its fitness on the novel host such that between-host transmission can be sustained. When a virus emerges in a new host, it transitions to a new adaptive landscape.

This feature of virus evolution is especially prominent in within-host HIV evolution, where virus phylogenies show a ladder-like structure over time. Here, successive waves of virus genotypes expand and contract in response to host-imposed diversifying selection, particularly in the envelope (env) gene. 174 These phylogenies dramatically contrast with between-host HIV evolution, which show more branched distributions as different lineages survive and differentiate over time. 174 High viral mutation rates, however, may be a double-edged sword. While facilitating the acquisition of beneficial mutations, the high frequency of deleterious mutations may \"sandbag\" virus populations and slow adaptive evolution. 175, 176 The effects of mutation load are more pronounced in small populations or when populations pass through bottlenecks. 177, 178 By nature, viruses experience severe bottlenecks during between-host transmission. Only a tiny fraction of a virus population's within-host growth is expected to successfully encounter a new host. These bottlenecks can result in a loss of genetic diversity, mutation accumulation, and fitness losses. For example, in an evolutionary study of the potyvirus tobacco etch virus, strong bottlenecks imposed on serially passaged virus populations produced fitness losses of \u00df5% per passage. 179 Since the number of viruses transmitted between hosts is proportional to its within-host growth, viruses that grow poorly within a host have a lower probability of being transmitted. This point is especially pertinent for emerging viruses, because they are expected to be poorly adapted to novel hosts. 16 Because emerging viruses are often poorly adapted, within-host replication is reduced, and, correspondingly, the number of viruses released from the host is also reduced. This has two consequences. First, the number of viruses in transmission vehicles (e.g., sneeze droplets, fomites, etc.) is decreased, reducing the chance that they will be picked up by another host. Second, if a new host is encountered, the number of particles entering the host is also decreased, reducing the probability that the virus can establish itself in that host without being eliminated by the immune system, inactivated, or washed out of the organism. In fact, these effects are likely compounded during each transmission event in a vicious cycle, and likely give rise to stuttering transmission chains that eventually go extinct. 180, 181 In this sense, the population dynamics of preemerged viruses can be described by the source-sink paradigm of ecology, which will be discussed in greater detail later in this paper.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 523, "end": 526, "text": "174", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 698, "end": 701, "text": "174", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 932, "end": 936, "text": "175,", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "176", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "177,", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1065, "text": "178", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1555, "text": "179", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1861, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2679, "text": "180,", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 2680, "end": 2683, "text": "181", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus evolvability"}, {"text": "An enduring paradox in evolutionary biology is the harm done to hosts by the parasites that depend on them for survival.

In brief, every virus has an optimal virulence that maximizes between-host transmission. Increases or decreases in virulence will evolve insofar as they also increase virus transmission. 182 With respect to virus emergence, the relevance of virulence evolution largely stems from the supposed mismatch between virus virulence in a novel host and its optimal virulence in that host.

For example, Ebola virus (EBOV) is remarkable for its extreme virulence in humans. Mortality rates due to EBOV are approximately 50%. 183 Given that EBOV is spread through direct contact with infected individuals, EBOV's excessive virulence curtails the duration of infectivity and person-to-person contact rates, thus reducing the transmission potential of the virus. This reduction in transmission may be the reason why EBOV outbreaks are, so far, spatially limited to certain regions of Africa. However, EBOV outbreaks have been trending upward in both numbers of individuals infected and area affected. The most recent outbreak in West Africa resulted in 25,000 cases of infection and 10,000 deaths across three nations, which exceeds the totals for all previous EBOV outbreaks combined. 184 Reports examining EBOV evolution during the latest outbreak caution that the virus might eventually evolve greater transmission and fully emerge in human populations. 185, 186 Excessive virulence is not the only reason why a virus may fail to emerge. An insufficiently virulent virus may suffer the same fate because within-host growth is not high enough to effect transmission to a new host. In addition, the weakly virulent virus may lose in direct competition for resources with a more virulent genotype. An example of the competitive replacement of a weakly virulent virus by a more virulent genotype comes from the dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3). Before 1989, DENV-3 was endemic to the Indian subcontinent, but caused mild or no disease in humans. 187 After 1989, the virulence of DENV-3 changed and caused outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe, often fatal form of the disease. Messer et al. showed that the sudden onset of dengue hemorrhagic fever was caused by the competitive displacement of group A DENV-3 strain by group B DENV-3 strain in the Indian subcontinent. 187 Subsequent work showed that the group B DENV3 strain infects and disseminates in Ae. aegypti more efficiently than the group A DENV3 strain, suggesting that the invasive strain is transmitted more effectively. 188", "cite_spans": [{"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "183", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "text": "184", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1103, "text": "185,", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1107, "text": "186", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1690, "text": "187", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2023, "text": "187", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emergence and the evolution of virulence"}, {"text": "In a source-sink scenario, a primary host population (the source) contributes virus \"migrants\" to a secondary host population (the sink), where the virus is poorly adapted. 74, 189, 190 By definition, populations existing in sinks have a negative population growth rate; thus, they are expected to go extinct in the absence of migration. 75 The influx of migrants can provide genetic diversity and contribute to densitydependent growth in the sink population, allowing the acquisition and fixation of mutations increasing fitness in the secondary host. 75 Eventually, fitness gains are such that the virus is able to escape the sink by achieving positive population growth, even in the absence of migration. 189, 190 The difficulties encountered in the evolutionary transition required to turn an ecological sink into a source are probably the strongest constraining factors in virus emergence.

An illustrative example comes from outbreaks of an arbovirus-bluetongue virus (BTV)-among ruminants in Europe. In its native range, BTV is vectored by Culicoides imicola midges. 209 In recent years, a sub-Saharan strain of the virus expanded northward from Africa, first to Southern and Eastern Europe and then into Northern and Western Europe, leading to widespread mortality among livestock. 209 Changes in climate have been implicated as a major driver in the expansion of BTV's range. 210 The most compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis is the observation of BTV and C. imicola in regions that have warmed the most since the 1990s, but not in regions that stayed cool during this period. 210 The northward shift in BTV's range likely stemmed from the expansion of the African-Asian vector C. imicola northward, 211 where it came into contact with indigenous European Culicoides species. 209, 212, 213 BTV then switched vectors from C. imicola midges to C. obsoletus and C. pulicaris midges adapted to the cooler, wetter climes of Northern Europe. 212, 213 The overlapping Culicoides populations may have allowed BTV to increase its infection competence in the latter vectors. 213 Environmental variables of elevation, temperature, and rainfall had the biggest impact on BTV spread because they affected vector abundance and host availability. 214, 215 Temperature, in particular, affected the magnitude of BTV's basic reproductive number (R 0 ), a measure of the transmission potential of a disease. 216 R 0 was maximal when temperatures ranged from 20 to 25\u00b0C, but declined outside that range. 214 The connection likely stems from the fact that Culicoides midges show increased activity, reproduction, and feeding behavior at higher temperatures. 209, 217 In addition, milder winter temperatures promote midge overwinter survival and are crucial for the maintenance of BTV presence in any particular region. 218 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 530, "end": 533, "text": "209", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "209", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "210", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1055, "text": "210", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1178, "text": "211", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1255, "text": "209,", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1260, "text": "212,", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1264, "text": "213", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1415, "text": "212,", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "text": "213", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1543, "text": "213", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1711, "text": "214,", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1715, "text": "215", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1867, "text": "216", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1962, "text": "214", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 2112, "end": 2116, "text": "209,", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 2117, "end": 2120, "text": "217", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 2273, "end": 2276, "text": "218", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Environmental change and impacts on virus ecology"}, {"text": "In the spring of 1993, an unknown pathogen infecting humans appeared in the Southwestern United States, resulting in death in more than 40% of cases. 219 The causative agent was soon identified as a previously unknown hantavirus (Bunyaviridae), subsequently named Sin Nombre virus (SNV). 220 SNV's reservoir host was subsequently identified as the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus, a common inhabitant of the deserts and dwellings of the southwest. 221 Peromyscus population densities were shown to have increased threefold to 20-fold between 1992 and 1993. The Peromyscus population surge was linked to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation event of 1992, which resulted in increased temperatures and precipitation in the region during the fall, winter, and spring of 1992-1993. 219 The outcome was a trophic cascade. The increased precipitation recharged the thirsty soil and increased primary production. More plants led to increased rodent forage, such as seeds, berries, nuts, and insects. Improved forage augmented rodent survival and reproductive output. Greater rodent densities led to increased contact rates among rodents and pushed them to their range margins, such as human dwellings. The higher rodent densities likely facilitated increased SNV infection rates, triggering spillover infections in consanguineous human populations. 219 Rodent populations in the area subsequently crashed, reaching a nadir during the La Ni\u00f1a event (a dry and cold period) in the spring of 1996. 219 Human SNV infections diminished as well. 219 In 1997-1998, another El Ni\u00f1o episode appeared, and rodent populations resurged. 219 However, fewer human SNV infections were reported in 1998 than in 1993. 219 Curiously, human cases doubled the following year in 1999. 219 While rodent densities in 1999 were lower than in 1998, the density of SNVinfected rodents in 1999 was an order of magnitude higher than at any other time during this study. 219 This pattern was repeated in subsequent El Ni\u00f1o events. 222 The precise causes of this time-lagged infection prevalence are unclear, but it is hypothesized that prevalence of infection in Peromyscus populations is proportional to the population densities reached during the previous reproductive season. 223 The greatest SNV risk to humans, therefore, occurs 2-3 years following the increased precipitation event. 219 However, strictly speaking, SNV has not yet fully emerged according to the three-step process established earlier in this paper. Sustained human-to-human transmission has not yet been observed. 224 In fact, person-to-person transmission of hantaviruses has been documented only for the Andes virus. 225 Given that SNV is mainly transmitted to humans by exposure to rodent urine and feces, human sanitary habits may reduce the opportunities for human-to-human transmission of SNV. While the specific mechanism of Andes virus human-to-human transmission has not been established, some evidence suggests that close exposure among sex partners and family members may be responsible. 226 It stands to reason that hantaviruses may be optimized for indirect transmission but can gain the ability to be spread by bodily contact, as the Andes virus may have done. If a hantavirus, such as SNV, gains the ability to spread via direct human contact, the prospects for emergence are troublesome.

While it is unlikely that gene drives can result in vector extinction because of the evolution of gene-drive resistance, such gene drives could suppress vector populations below levels required for sustained virus transmission, breaking epidemics and preventing further virus dissemination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 287, "text": "234", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "235", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 560, "end": 563, "text": "236", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 913, "end": 916, "text": "237", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1070, "text": "238", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1256, "text": "238", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1464, "end": 1472, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "How can we defend against emerging viruses?"}, {"text": "Finally, education should factor into any plan to combat emerging infectious viruses.

The E1 and E2 glycoproteins dimerize and form 80 membrane-embedded trimeric spikes across the virus capsid surface, shown in dark blue.

(B)In replicative recombination or template switching, a polymerase molecule changes template during the process of replicating a nucleic acid strand. If the templates are derived from different sources, then novel genetic material can be introduced into the virus genome. (C) During the process of virus integration and excision from a host genome, viruses can acquire genetic material from the host. These genes can increase infectivity or aid in host suppression. (D) Reassortment occurs following coinfection of a host cell by multiple segmented viruses. Replicated genome segments are packaged into procapsids irrespective of the parent of origin.

Dates marked with dashed vertical lines on \"elbows\" indicate the mean time of divergence of the pandemic H1N1/09 segments from corresponding virus lineages. Reassortment events not involved with the emergence of human disease are omitted. Fort Dix refers to the last major outbreak of swine-derived influenza H1N1 in humans. The first triple-reassortant swine viruses were detected in 1998, but, to improve clarity, the origin of this lineage is placed earlier.

Each point is the mean of five replicate measurements of fitness. Bars are \u00b11 SE. Mutations incur a \u00df10% fitness cost on the original host, Pseudomonas phaseolicola, indicative of antagonistic pleiotropy. Mean fitness values are much more variable on the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes, but are approximately one order of magnitude lower than fitness on the original host. These data are suggestive of significant maladaptation between the bacteriophage and its novel host.
