First identified and isolated in the village of Sungai Nipah, Malaysia in 1999 during a severe disease outbreak in humans and pigs, NiV was initially diagnosed as a Hendra-like virus and named \u2018Nipah\u2019.1 During this outbreak the virus was isolated from multiple species, including humans, horses, dogs, cats, cattle, and rats.2, 3 Clinical symptoms in humans occurred in those with direct contact with pigs. Further investigation found that Malaysian outbreaks had begun in September 1998 and lasted until April 1999, resulting in 105 human deaths and culling of 1.1 million pigs.3",
