Poor body condition and signs referable to the respiratory system such as dyspnea, open-mouth breathing, elbow abduction, sternal recumbency, neck extension, reluctance to move, abnormal lung sounds, or lack of respiratory sounds may indicate cardiovascular compromise. Vascular and cardiac clinical abnormalities may be similar to those of the small companion mammal, including episodes of syncope, distended jugular veins, or abdominal distention. Exophthalmia can occur with severe venous congestion and may indicate a underlying cardiac disease.1 In addition, thymoma is a common cause of exophthalmus in the rabbit, especially if the patient has normal cardiac sounds evaluated through auscultation.8\n",

In addition, obese animals may also have a markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette caused by the accumulation of pericardial fat. The cardiac silhouette of exotic herbivores extends from the second rib to the caudal border of the fifth rib or from the third to the sixth ribs. The lung fields are relatively small and surround a wide cranial mediastinum. The aorta and caudal vena cava are normally visible as are pulmonary vessels. The tracheal carina is present at the fourth or fifth intercostal space. Abnormal calcification of the aorta may be best visualized on a lateral radiographic image.5 Cardiomegaly should be considered if the heart extends beyond 2.5 to 3 rib spaces (wide) on the lateral image.5 The diagnosis of cardiomegaly is usually consistent with cardiac chamber dilation or hypertrophy, pericardial effusion, or the presence of a cardiac mass. Cardiogenic edema may be evident via increased pulmonary densities, and tracheal elevation due to cardiac enlargement may occur.",

The normal cardiac activity of exotic herbivores results in a positive P wave, followed by a primarily upright QRS complex in lead II. The T wave is usually positive and reflects ventricular repolarization. The ECG of normal rabbits includes a pointed P wave in some breeds, peaked T waves, and a relatively long ST segment. The guinea pig ECG tracing more closely mimics that of humans when compared with other exotic herbivores because of the similarity of ion channels in the myocardium.11, 12, 16 An ECG should be used to diagnose arrhythmias when an irregular rhythm is detected on auscultation. Little is known about the ECG changes associated with cardiac diseases in exotic herbivores, and therefore the use of P-wave and QRS-complex morphology changes to assess cardiac chamber dilation or hypertrophy is not recommended. Radiographic images or, ideally, an echocardiogram should be obtained to evaluate cardiac size in small exotic herbivores if concerns exist.13\n",

The intensity of the murmur depends on the severity and direction of the regurgitation jet. Disease development is unknown in small exotic herbivores; however, it is believed to be a chronic process. As chronic degenerative AV valve disease progresses into congestive heart failure, the left atrium usually becomes severely dilated while the contractility of the enlarged left ventricle remains. Treatment for chronic degenerative AV valve disease is aimed at maintaining cardiac contractility, relieving congestion, and reducing vasoconstriction.14\n",

Fluid within the pericardial sac is often the result of neoplasia, but it can be due to coagulopathies, trauma, and atrial tears or may be iatrogenic (e.g., cardiocentesis). The effects of pericardial effusion depend on the rate and volume of the fluid accumulation and the compliance of the pericardium. Cardiac tamponade occurs when sufficient pericardial fluid accumulates within the pericardial space to increase the intrapericardial pressure above right atrial pressure, causing compression of the right side of the heart first, although the left side of the heart also can be affected as intrapericardial pressure increases. This impairment of ventricular filling leads to a decreased cardiac output and arterial hypotension.19, 24 Though rarely diagnosed in small exotic herbivores, pericardial effusion has been reported in guinea pigs, chinchillas, and rabbits.1, 25 Affected animals have been reported to present with ataxia and/or right-sided heart failure. Physical findings include muffled heart sounds, distended jugular veins, arterial hypotension, tachycardia, and pulsus paradoxus. The disease diagnosis is usually confirmed with echocardiography. Emergency pericardiocentesis is required to relieve cardiac tamponade.19 To reduce patient anxiety during the pericardiocentesis procedure, the animal can be premedicated with butorphanol and midazolam. Pericardiocentesis is contraindicated when patients have coagulopathies or if hemopericardium is due to an atrial tear. Because cardiac tamponade involves decreased preload, increasing intravascular volume cautiously with a fluid bolus is warranted. Attempts to lower venous pressures using medical therapy should be avoided. Treatment to lower venous pressures will exacerbate the condition by further reducing preload, resulting in significant reduction in cardiac output and hypotension.19\n",

End-diastolic volume is largely dependent on venous return, with atrial contraction contributing little to normal preload. Sustained tachycardia can result in myocardial failure.31, 32 A research investigation determined that pacing of a rabbit's right atrium or ventricle at rates between 350 and 400 beats/min over a period of several weeks produced myocardial depression and clinical signs of heart failure (malignant tachycardia).28 In small animals the most common cause of malignant tachycardia is a supraventricular tachycardia. The development of malignant tachycardia can occur through primary cardiac disease or a cardiac manifestation of another systemic disease process. Medical therapy includes calcium channel antagonists or \u03b2-blockers to slow the heart rate, as well as management of the underlying disease condition. Rapid ventricular tachycardia may respond to intravenous administration of lidocaine. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker also used to reduce AV conduction and, subsequently, heart rate. However, diltiazem depresses myocardial contractility and may cause hypotension. Other antiarrhythmic drugs, mexiletine and sotalol, have been tested experimentally in rabbits to treat ventricular tachycardias as well as atrial fibrillation, but their chronic use has not been evaluated in the pet rabbit.33 Dosages of cardiac drugs are found in Table 3.\n",

Blood culture/sensitivity should be obtained from affected animals. Abnormal findings from a complete blood count often include a neutrophilic leukocytosis. If an active bacterial infection is present, band neutrophils are often identified, whereas with chronic infections, a monocytosis is common. Echocardiography is the diagnostic test of choice for this disease, because collection of myocardial biopsy specimens is not an option for the majority of cases. Echocardiography usually reveals chamber dilatation and poor contractility, with the valve structure and function remaining normal. Treatment is aimed at improving cardiac contractility, relieving congestion, reducing vasoconstriction, sterilizing lesions, and eliminating the spread of infection.36\n",

When one is initiating furosemide treatment, a higher dose can be used to induce diuresis. Nitroglycerin, a venodilator, is recommended to reduce congestion. Augmentation of systolic performance is important with acute congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy and other disease processes affecting contractility (e.g., chronic mitral regurgitation). Positive inotropic agents are commonly used to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate.19 Though short acting and administered intravenously as a continuous-rate infusion, dobutamine and dopamine can be used to improve cardiac contractility. Both drugs are sympathomimetic agents that bind to \u03b21-receptors, thereby increasing production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate.37 Dopamine also affects \u03b11-receptors and therefore must be used with caution because of its effects on vasoconstriction and heart rate. A positive inotrope should be added to the treatment protocol if systolic function is moderately to severely impaired. Pimobendan is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and benzimidazole-pyridazinone derivative approved for the treatment of congestive heart failure in dogs. It is a calcium sensitizer with positive inotropic and vasodilator effects.38 Its use is has been reported in a rabbit with heart failure due to myxomatous disease affecting the mitral and tricuspid valves. The rabbit responded well to initial therapy and survived for 7 months despite the presence of advanced cardiac disease at the time of diagnosis.5 Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, is another example of a positive inotropic agent. It has been used successfully in rabbits to manage atrial fibrillation, mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and dilated cardiomyopathy.1 Strict cage rest and the reduction of stress within the patient's environment are also important when one is managing or treating a congestive heart failure patient.",

            "text": "Ideally, animals should be rapidly intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube to ensure a patent airway and allow for artificial ventilation. Intubation of small exotic herbivores is difficult because of their relatively small oral cavity, large fleshy tongue, distal glottis, and laryngospasms, as well as the relative ease of causing iatrogenic damage to the pharynx and larynx. If the airway is not readily accessed, a tightly fitting mask may be used for positive-pressure ventilation. A retrospective study on cardiopulmonary arrest in rabbits reported that 5 of 7 animals recovered when using only a tight-fitting mask during CPR. This study suggests that a tight-fitting mask is an effective method for providing ventilation and may negate the need for emergency intubation in many rabbit cases that require CPR.40 Blind intubation should not be used because this technique requires normal patient respiration. If possible, one may use a small endoscope to observe the tracheal opening for a fast, reliable method of intubation. Though not as effective, a small, flat-bladed laryngoscope can be used to assist with intubation. To properly intubate a small exotic herbivore, the animal should be placed in sternal or dorsal recumbency with its neck extended. The soft palate may need to be directed away from the epiglottis for adequate exposure of the laryngeal opening. A stylet placed inside the endotracheal tube can be used to facilitate intubation. If it is not possible to establish an adequate airway using the methods described above, a tracheostomy is the procedure of choice.41 Once a patent airway is in place, ventilation is initiated by use of an Ambu bag or a mechanical ventilator to deliver air or preferably 100% oxygen to the patient. The recommended ventilation rate for small exotic herbivores is approximately 10 to 24 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 10 to 15 mL/kg and a peak inflation pressure of 20 cm H2O. The volume of air/oxygen delivered should produce a visible chest rise of approximately 25% to 30% from resting state.39, 42, 43\n",

            "text": "Once the airway is established, circulation must be addressed. In the absence of a palpable heartbeat or peripheral pulses, chest compressions should be initiated. Circulatory arrest can be correlated to a lack of electrical activity, a severe bradyarrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ventricular flutter, fibrillation), or electromechanical dissociation.40, 42, 44 The critical patient should be positioned in lateral recumbency, with the resuscitator's hand placed near the fifth intercostal space over the costochondral junction. Chest compressions can be performed either with one hand or with both hands placed on either side of the chest. Each chest compression should compress the chest by 25% to 33%. This force of compression is needed to adequately move blood and maintain circulation. Adequate cardiac massage can result in palpable arterial pulses and improved membrane color and perfusion or can lead to spontaneous return of heartbeats. The number of chest compressions delivered per minute during CPR is an important factor in the return of spontaneous circulation to the patient and, ultimately, its survival with few to no neurologic side effects. The actual number of chest compressions delivered per minute is undetermined at this time for small exotic herbivores, but it should correlate to the recommendations in small animal (e.g., dog, cat) emergency medicine of 110 to 120 beats/min. In most studies, more compressions are associated with higher survival rates and fewer compressions are associated with lower survival rates; however, it is unrealistic to maintain rapid chest compressions for an extended period of time. Emphasis should not only be placed on proper compression technique and rate but also on minimizing interruptions. Even with optimal technique being used, closed-chest CPR is capable of producing only 20% of the cardiac output compared with spontaneous heartbeats.42, 45\n",

The severity of the acidemia is linked to the duration of the event, the amount of blood flow, and the arterial oxygen content during CPR. There are few published reports to support the use of bicarbonate to treat tissue acidosis. Moreover, a wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to bicarbonate administration. Severe alkalosis can shift the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve and inhibit oxygen release to the tissues. Bicarbonate can also produce excess carbon dioxide (CO2), which is capable of diffusing freely into myocardial and cerebral cells. This may contribute to intracellular acidosis and may inactivate simultaneously administered catecholamines.39 It is the restoration of tissue oxygenation with appropriate ventilation and tissue perfusion through chest compressions, as well as rapid return of spontaneous circulation, that restores acid-base balance produced in cardiac arrest.54\n",

ECGs are essential to monitor small exotic herbivores during cardiac arrest by allowing the clinician to determine the appropriate treatment and monitoring the return of spontaneous cardiac activity. Other equipment including pulse oximetry will not function because there is a lack of adequate pulsatile blood flow in peripheral tissue beds. After the initiation of cardiac compressions, detection of a pulse by oximetry indicates that chest compressions are being performed in an appropriate manner. Multiple human and small animal studies of arterial blood gas monitoring have shown that it is an inaccurate indicator of tissue hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or acidosis during a cardiac arrest event.57 Capnography is an important tool for monitoring the success of resuscitation, and monitoring end-tidal CO2 of a cardiac arrest patient can be used as an indicator of cardiac output generated during CPR. This indicator of cardiac output generated during CPR may be an early prognostic indicator for the return of spontaneous circulation. Studies have shown that patients who were successfully revived after cardiac arrest had significantly higher end-tidal CO2 levels than patients who could not be resuscitated.58 Higher end-tidal levels during CPR are associated with increased myocardial perfusion pressure, whereas low end-tidal levels represent ineffective elimination of CO2 due to low blood flow.58\n",

Cardiovascular and ventilatory support is necessary to maintain cardiopulmonary function and cerebral blood flow. Continuous ECG monitoring is vital, because myocardial hypoxia can lead to severe dysrhythmias. Alterations in rate or rhythm may also indicate other systemic abnormalities such as hyperkalemia or increased intracranial pressure. If an increase in intracranial pressure is suspected, treatment with mannitol is indicated. If a patient is unable to maintain adequate oxygen or CO2 levels, mechanical ventilation is recommended. The impairment of blood flow and ischemic damage to the gastrointestinal tract during cardiac and pulmonary arrest should always be a concern in small exotic herbivores. Any damage to the gastrointestinal tract in a small exotic herbivore patient may lead to impaired mucosal integrity, dysbiosis, translocation of bacteria, and toxins in the bloodstream. Poor perfusion to the kidneys can lead to acute renal failure; therefore, attentive monitoring of electrolyte status and urine output is recommended to prevent adverse health effects. It is very important to maintain adequate blood pressure in these patients using appropriate fluid therapy and vasopressors or inotropic drugs, as needed.39\n",
