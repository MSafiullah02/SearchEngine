Sediments from Bay of Vidy, Switzerland (rich in nutrients), Lake Bret (eutrophic) and Versoix River in Lake Geneva (nutrientpoor) were selected to design the microcosm. The microcosms were contaminated with waste water inoculums for 24 hours. Total coliform and E. coli concentrations decreased during the first five days where as enterococci concentrations remained constant for all three sediments. Growth phase was observed between days 5-12 for the FIB. The FIB showed persistence up to 50 days. Lake Vidy showed the maximum increase in indicator organism concentration. This study confirms earlier studies that nutrient availability increases the survival of microbes especially for E. coli. Also, microorganisms have increased survival in sediments around coastal environments.",

The section on occurrence and transport is organized into the following subsections: persistence and transport of FIB, particle association and transport of microbes, microbial quality of recreational beaches, occurrence of FIB and pathogens in watersheds, irrigation systems, estuaries, and wetlands, and novel indicators. In the section on detection methods, endpoint PCR and reverse transcription PCR, real-time PCR, loop mediated isothermal amplifications, array based genetic and phenotype based diagnostics which includes oligonucleotide arrays and genetic amplification arrays, and genotyping are discussed. The section on MST covers both genotypic and phenotypic MST methods. Environmental Occurrence, Persistence and Transport FIB are traditionally used to monitor the water quality for drinking and recreational activities. Understanding the behavior of FIB and pathogens in the environment is essential for assessing the human health risks and the environmental impacts.

            "text": "Occurrence of FIB and pathogens inwatersheds. Storm water runoff is one of the significant factors contributing to contamination of surface waters. The removal of indicator bacteria in storm water by nine different BMPs were compared in Charlotte, NorthCarolina(Hathaway et al., 2009). The BMPs included one wet pond, two storm-water wetlands, two dry detention basins, one bioretention area and three proprietary devices.It was observed that one of the wetlands and the bioretention area was most efficient at reducing bacteria concentrations from the influent. The two dry detention basins performed the worst showing negative removal of fecal bacteria. Three urban watersheds in Santa Barbara, California showed a high concentration of both FIB and human-specific Bacteroides marker(Sercu et al., 2009).These high concentrations were sourced to storm events and storm drains that varied up to five orders of magnitude within the same day for human Bacteroides marker concentration.In another study, indicator bacteria levels in 15 streams in 11 watersheds in southern California were monitored through one year(Tiefenthaler et al., 2009). This helped to set reference levels of E. coli and enterococci during dry weather and non-storm conditions. There were seasonal fluctuations with highest levels of FIB occurring during June through August.Studies were conducted to investigate the origin and distribution of fecal contamination in a bay in Lake Geneva, Switzerland). There were 23 sampling sites within the bay and 3 point sources at the wastewater outlets for E. coli, enterococci and total coliform. The wastewater outlet, situated at a depth of 30 meters, contributed to maximum fecal contamination to the bay area. Microbial contamination shows a sharp increase during flood conditions and was subject to flow rate and temperature of the river. FIB profile examined across the vertical water column indicated that higher FIB levels were present at the hypolimnion at 25 m depth with relatively less contamination at the lake surface, thereby making the water relatively safe for recreation purposes. Studies were also done to evaluate the sediments of the Bay of Vidy, Lake Geneva, Switzerland). E. coli and enterococci concentrations were around 3.1 X 10 5 CFU/g and 1.2 x 10 5 CFU/g respectively. There was a decrease of E. coli and enterococci with depth in the vertical sediment profile from 10 6 CFU at the surface to about 10 4 -10 5 CFU at 10 cm below the surface. Sediments near the waste water treatment plant outlet were monitored for 90 days and showed no decrease in FIB concentration with time. This suggests sediments act as reservoirs of fecal contamination.The Thomas-Brook watershed in Canada was monitored for fecal indicators and total suspended solids to study the spatial and temporal patterns of microbial load from five sub-watersheds(Sinclair et al., 2009). It was observed that runoff from agricultural activity contributed to higher bacterial load than residential runoff. Also, higherWater Environment Research, Volume 82, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2010 Water Environment Federation 889 concentrations of FIB were noted during storm events and in years with higher cumulative precipitation. Similarly, the occurrence of somatic coliphages, F+ specific RNA bacteriophages, and conventional indicator bacteria were examined over five locations of Swist river, Germany (Franke et al., 2009). River samples were taken over a year and surface runoff samples were taken in the same position after rainfall events. There was a high correlation between concentration of somatic coliphages and land use. The lowest median concentrations of somatic phages were detected where forests (400 PFU/l) surrounded the river while the highest median concentration was found around farmland (591,000 PFU/l). The median concentrations of F+ specific RNA bacteriophages in the river did not vary significantly to land use. In addition, indicator bacteria were not able to significantly correlate to the detection of coliphages and for human pathogen viruses. Occurrence of FIB and pathogens in irrigation systems. In a study conducted in the South Nation River Basin in eastern Ontario, Canada, water samples were analyzed for pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp.), parasites (Cryptosporidium and Giardia) and indicator bacteria (E. coli, enterococci, total coliforms and C. perfringens) (Wilkes et al., 2009). There was significant relation of pathogenic bacteria with indicator bacteria. Salmonella showed significant positive correlations at all seasons where as Campylobacter and L. monocytogenes had highest correlation during spring-summer. Cryptosporidium cysts showed significant correlation with indicator bacteria during winter where as Giardia showed less correlation with negative correlation in a few cases. The occurrence of enteric viruses in groundwater used for irrigation located in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, was monitored with reverse transcription PCR and cell culture PCR (Cheong et al., 2009). PCR based assays were developed to detect adenoviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses and rotaviruses. 17% of the groundwater samples collected were positive with adenoviruses and enteroviruses. However, noroviruses and rotaviruses were not detected in any of the samples. Results also showed that frequency levels of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and enterococci were below the frequency of the viruses in the groundwater samples. Since the occurrence of enteric viruses were not correlated with the levels of indicator bacteria, viral contamination of irrigation water may be undetected and present a potential risk to human health.",

Forty estuarine water samples were collected monthly between September 2006 and April 2007 and analyzed using ultrafiltration with reverse transcriptase PCR. Hepatitis A and norovirus were identified in 80% and 70% of the samples respectively. Both viruses were present during shrimp harvest season which poses a health risk to consumers of marine products. Also there was not an association between viruses with respect to fecal coliforms and E. coli; detection of these indicators in the samples were 49% and 34% respectively.Occurrence of FIB and pathogens in wetlands.Wetlands are often used as tertiary wastewater treatments for reuse of reclaimed water. Wetlands can remove human pathogens by sedimentation, attachment to plant roots, UV radiation and predation by protozoa. The efficiency of subsurface flow (SSF) and free-surface flow (FSF) constructed horizontal wetlands were evaluated for efficiency at removal of microorganisms from waste water(Graczyk et al., 2009). It was seen that SSF wetland performed better than the FSF wetlands with a pathogen removal efficiency of 30.9%. The three FSF wetlands had negative efficiency of -96.6%, -63.4% and -92.1%    implying that the effluent had higher concentrations of pathogens compared to the influent. This indicates that wetlands add pathogenic microorganisms from wildlife and birds, therefore, this form of tertiary treatment need to be reconsidered. However in a similar study using a marshland upwelling system in Louisiana, it was observed that fecal bacteria from waste water completely died off in four months).Vegetation can act as buffers to prevent transport of fecal contaminated rain water from polluting surface water drainages and reservoirs. Three herbage species, white clover, orchard grass and perennial ryegrass, at three canopy heights (short, medium and tall) were evaluated for their efficiency to disperse fecal bacteria in rain from an artificial rain device(Boyer and Belesky, 2009). White clover at the short canopy level demonstrated the greatest dispersion of fecal coliforms.Enterococcus gave the best results with no false positives when using the Luminex method). Human specific bacterial marker genes that worked well with qPCR were the Enterococcus esp marker and the Bacteroides thetaiotamicron. The Luminex method worked Methanobrevibacter smithii. However repeatability for M. smithii was poor. A study was carried out to evaluate the water in a high-altitude system receiving wastewater that was used for Water Environment Research, Volume 82, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2010 Water Environment Federation 891 irrigation and drinking in Mexico City for the presence of enterovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, coliphages and indicator bacteria(Espinosa et al., 2009). The irrigation water was positive for fecal indicator bacteria including fecal coliforms, enterococci and total coliforms. Coliphages corresponded most closely with the presence of FIB in the samples. In the drinking water samples no viruses were detected before chlorination. However fecal indicator bacteria were found with enterococci being the most frequent. Therefore, adequate disinfection treatment of wastewater was required for reuse as drinking water. Also, this study confirms coliphages can be used as alternate indicators of fecal contamination. Wastewater reused for irrigation should have coliforms within the acceptable limits of <1000 CFU as specified by WHO but this limit was exceeded in the present study area.Alternative indicators that are being considered include coliphages, human specific marker in Bacteroidales and human viruses. Sunlight inactivation of indicator bacteria was investigated at a sewage polluted marine beach. Concentrations of each organism measured during the day and night showed that occurrence was higher during light hours than dark hours except for the human Bacteroidales marker and enterovirus markers. The organisms tested included E. coli, enterococci, somatic coliphages, human enterovirus and human adenovirus. They also developed empirical models to determine the rates of sunlight inactivation for the various indicator microorganisms. From these models, the rates of sunlight inactivation for enterococci, E. coli and species including Salmonella enteritidis and S.typhimurium(Hadjinicolaou et al., 2009).
