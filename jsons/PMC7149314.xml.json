The susceptible target cell is the villous enterocyte (Saif, 1990). Thus active immunity against enteropathogenic viral infections depends on stimulation of local immune responses within the intestine. To date, only limited success has been achieved in the development of oral vaccines to prevent neonatal viral diarrheas, and commercial vaccines show limited efficacy in the field (Saif and Jackwood, 1990). Although use of live attenuated poliovirus is often cited as a model for an effective oral vaccine, the mechanism of viral pathogenesis and hence protective immunity differs from that needed to prevent viral diarrheas. Poliovirus undergoes primary replication in Peyer's patches or intestinal lymphoid cells (not epithelial cells), but the target cell for disease induction is the neuron (Melnick, 1990). Thus stimulation of circulating antibodies using either live oral or inactivated poliovirus vaccines can prevent the systemic spread of poliovirus to the central nervous system and the paralytic disease.",

Whether the problems encountered with oral administration of soluble protein antigens can be overcome by the use of improved mucosal adjuvants [muranyl dipeptide, immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMs), cholera or Escherichia coli enterotoxins, avridine, proteosomes, cytokines, etc.] or new and novel delivery systems (liposomes, live recombinant vectors, microspheres, DNA plasmids, virus-like particles) requires further investigation, and specific examples are given in this review.",

In this review, the impact of the site of viral replication (intestine vs respiratory tract), vaccine dose, and type (attenuated, inactivated) on the isotype, level, and distribution of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and protection against viral challenge in pigs is summarized and discussed.",

Virulent TGEV replicates in villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine, inducing severe villous atrophy and a malabsorptive diarrhea leading to nearly 100% mortality in seronegative, neonatal pigs. Attenuated strains of TGEV replicate in scattered villous epithelial cells in the distal portion of the small intestine of neonatal pigs and induce mild or no diarrhea (Frederick et al., 1976). They also replicate more extensively in the respiratory tract compared to virulent TGEV strains (Furuuchi et al., 1979). In contrast, PRCV strains replicate in the upper and lower respiratory tract, with little or no replication in the intestine, and generally cause subclinical infections or mild respiratory disease (Pensaert and Cox, 1989). TGEV infections remain a leading cause of piglet diarrhea and mortality in swine herds in North America, and commercial vaccines, even live attenuated oral TGEV vaccines, are of limited efficacy in the field (Saif and Wesley, 1992). In previous studies, PRCV induced partial protection against experimental challenge with TGEV (Van Nieuwstadt et al., 1989; Cox et al., 1993), but the mechanisms involved were not elucidated. These three antigenically related porcine coronaviruses with distinct differences in virulence and tissue tropisms (enteric TGEV-A or TGEV-V or respiratory PRCV) provided an ideal model to study interactions between bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT) and gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) in the induction of mucosal immunity and protection against virulent TGEV challenge (Brim et al., 1995; Saif, 1996; VanCott et al., 1993, 1994).",

Poor efficacy has frequently been encountered in the field using live oral or parenterally administered vaccines to prevent coronavirus and rotavirus-induced diarrhea in swine (Saif and Jackwood, 1990). Likewise, clinical trials of candidate rotavirus vaccines in infants have often failed in various aspects of safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy, especially when tested in developing countries (Kapikian and Chanock, 1990).

Three groups of 11-day-old TGEV seronegative pigs were oronasally inoculated with virulent TGEV, PRCV, or mock-infected cell-culture fluids, respectively, and challenged 24 days later with virulent TGEV (Brim et al., 1995; Saif et al., 1994b; Saif, 1996; VanCott et al., 1993, 1994). Immune responses in intestinal (gut lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and respiratory (bronchial lymph nodes, BLN) lymphoid tissues were assessed at challenge and postchallenge day (PCD) 4 by enumeration of IgA and IgG TGEV-specific ASC by ELISPOT and by lymphoproliferative assays (LPAs) using inactivated TGEV as antigen. The major ASC responses and percent of pigs protected are summarized in Table III\n. All pigs inoculated with TGEV-V developed diarrhea, shed TGEV in feces, and recovered. The presence of high numbers of IgA-ASC in the gut lamina propria (LP) and high LPA responses in the MLN at challenge (PCD 0) was associated with 100% protection against diarrhea after TGEV challenge. No significant increases were observed in numbers of ASC or LPA responses in the gut LP or MLN, respectively, after TGEV challenge (PCD 4), reflecting the lack of viral replication associated with complete protection. In contrast, pigs inoculated with PRCV had no clinical disease and shed virus in nasal secretions\nbut not feces. At challenge (PCD 0), the PRCV-exposed pigs had mainly IgG ASC and high LPA responses in the BLN, but low ASC numbers and LPA responses in the intestine (gut LP or MLN, respectively). About 58% of the pigs were protected against diarrhea (compared to 10% of controls) and only 17% were protected against fecal TGEV shedding (comparable to controls). After TGEV challenge (PCD 4), the numbers of IgG-ASC and to a lesser extent IgA-ASC increased rapidly in the intestinal lamina propria of the PRCV-exposed pigs, suggesting that virus-specific IgG-ASC precursors derived in BALT or systemic lymphoid tissues of the PRCV-exposed pigs may migrate to the intestine in response to TGEV challenge and contribute to the partial protection observed. The higher numbers of IgA-ASC in BALT of TGEV-exposed pigs compared to PRCV-exposed pigs at PCD 4 probably reflects TGEV replication and restimulation in the gut resulting in trafficking of IgA precursor cells from GALT to BALT (Husband, 1994; Mestecky, 1987; McGhee et al., 1992). Thus TGEV infections or vaccines that induce immunity via GALT and secondarily via BALT may prevent PRCV infections. Whether the more frequent use of live attenuated TGEV vaccines in the United States (which induce IgG ASC in BLN, Table IV\n) compared to Europe has had an impact on limiting the spread of PRCV infections in the United States is unknown, but at present PRCV infections appear to be less widespread among swine in the United States than in Europe. Thus our major conclusions were that functional compartmentalization exists in the BALT and GALT responses: immunization via BALT (PRCV infection) induced a systemic type of response (IgG-ASC) with low numbers of ASC and LPA responses in the gut and provided incomplete protection against TGEV-V. Immunization via GALT (TGEV-V infection) induced high numbers of IgA-ASC and high LPA responses in the gut and provided complete protection against TGEV-V induced diarrhea. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution of ASC and T lymphocytes should provide important insights to optimize oral vaccine regimens to elicit protective mucosal immune responses against enteric pathogens.",

            "text": "In a similar series of experiments, we also examined the effect of the dose (106 versus 108 pfu) of live TGEV-A administered oronasally to 11-day-old TGEV seronegative pigs, on primary and memory ASC responses in the MLN and BLN (Saif et al., 1994b; Saif, 1996; VanCott et al., 1993). Our findings (summarized in Table IV) revealed that the high dose of TGEV-A (108 pfu) induced 2\u20134 times more primary IgG ASC and about 5\u201320 times more memory IgG ASC in the MLN and BLN than the lower dose. Only the high dose of TGEV-A elicited low numbers of primary or memory IgA ASC in the MLN, but numbers were 9\u201315 times lower than after inoculation with TGEV-V. Of interest were the two- to fourfold higher numbers of primary and memory IgG ASC induced in BALT by the high-dose TGEV-A compared to TGEV-V consistent with reports that attenuated strains of TGEV replicate more extensively in the respiratory tract compared to virulent TGEV strains (Furuuchi et al., 1979). Thus the high degree of attenuation of TGEV vaccines leading to reduced viral replication in the intestine of the sow (Saif and Jackwood, 1990; Saif and Wesley, 1992) and the use of low doses (\u2264106 pfu/ml) of live attenuated TGEV vaccines orally in piglets (Saif et al., 1994b; VanCott et al., 1993) were major determinants in their failure to induce SIgA antibodies in sow's milk or IgA ASC in the piglets\u2019 intestines, respectively. Such factors presumably contribute to the corresponding lack of efficacy of TGEV vaccines in the field.",

The responses of mice to these constructs were as follows: (1) The two TGEV epitopes were immunogenic when injected intraperitoneally (IP) into mice as hybrid CIpG subunits, chimeric CS31A polymers, or recombinant bacteria; (2) the chimeric CS31A fibrillae elicited TGEV antibodies in the serum of mice reactive with TGEV peptides and native TGEV; and (3) mice inoculated orally with the recombinant bacteria produced IgA intestinal antibodies reactive against the CS31A fibrillae and TGEV SC peptide.",

The rationale for fusion with LT-B was to enhance the immunogenicity of the bivalent vaccine since LT-B also functions as an oral adjuvant. Studies of immune responses of rabbits inoculated with purified LT-B/SD fusion products expressed from Salmonella or the recombinant Salmonella revealed that neutralizing antibodies to TGEV were induced by the purified LT-B/SD and TGEV antibodies were elicited in serum and intestinal secretions after oral inoculation with the recombinant Salmonella. Thus, if similar TGEV neutralizing IgA antibody responses can be induced in the intestines of pigs by the recombinant bacterial vaccines, such vaccines warrant further study to access their ability to induce protective immunity to TGEV in pigs.",

Results of oral or IM inoculation of 3- to 5-day-old pigs with Wa human rotaviruses (G1, P1A) and homologous virulent rotavirus oral challenge at postinoculation day (PID) 21 are summarized in Table V\n. B-cell responses (ASC) were measured by ELISPOT for intestinal (lamina propria) and systemic (peripheral blood lymphocytes, PBL) lymphoid tissues at challenge (PID 21). The major findings were that the numbers of IgA ASCs in the intestinal lamina propria and PBL were significantly greater in virulent-rotavirus inoculated pigs (mimic natural infection) than in the other groups (attenuated, inactivated, controls) and were correlated (r = 0.9) with the high degree of protection against diarrhea (89% of piglets protected). The transient appearance of IgA ASC in the blood mirrored the IgA ASC responses in the gut and could serve as an indicator for IgA ASC intestinal responses after rotavirus infection. Piglets inoculated with attenuated rotavirus had partial protection against diarrhea (44% protected) and the second highest numbers of IgA and IgG ASC in the intestinal lamina propria. Interestingly pigs inoculated IM or perorally (PO) with inactivated rotavirus in IFA had a very high number of IgG ASCs in PBL, but few IgG or IgA ASCs in the intestinal lamina propria and, like pigs given inactivated virus PO, minimal protection (0\u201317%) against diarrhea. Thus, the vaccine type influenced the site, isotype, and level of the ASC response and, similar to the results of the TGEV studies, the degree of protection was correlated with the numbers of IgA ASCs induced in the intestine.",

            "text": "Although not yet evaluated in swine, a new strategy for rotavirus vaccines is the creation of recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by the coexpression of the four rotavirus capsid genes (VP2/4/6/7) in a baculovirus expression system (Crawford et al., 1994). The VLP vaccines administered with IFA have been tested in rotavirus seronegative mice and rabbits (Conner et al., 1996) and as a maternal vaccine to enhance passive immunity in rotavirus seropositive cows (Fernandez et al., 1996). The VLP vaccines were shown to be noninfectious (no RNA), stable, antigenically authentic, and highly immunogenic in the above species. They induced protective immunity against rotavirus shedding in vaccinated mice and rabbits (Conner et al., 1996) and passive immunity against rotavirus diarrhea in calves fed colostrum from the VLP-vaccinated cows (Fernandez et al., 1998). Thus VLP vaccines show promise as novel vaccines designed to induce mucosal immunity against rotavirus. Further research is needed to identify the optimal delivery systems and mucosal adjuvants for use with the VLP vaccines to most effectively stimulate mucosal immunity.",
