Both automated stainers used 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as the chromogen. Negative controls in which the primary antibody was omitted and positive controls on tissues with known positive immunoreactions for each antibody were used.

Bronchiolar injury was demonstrated by collections of fibrin within lumens that were associated with loss of cilia, bronchiole epithelial denudation, and focal deposition of fibrin on exposed basement membranes (Fig 2). Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia was present in only 1 of the 4 patients (25%) in this group. This light microscopy impression was supported by pancytokeratin immunostains, which demonstrated alveolar walls partially covered by hyaline membranes and lacking any type of epithelial lining cells.

            "text": "In the 8 SARS patients that we studied, the primary pathology in the lung was DAD. The histological correlate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), DAD has numerous possible causes, including infections, inhalants, ingestants, drugs, shock, sepsis, radiation, and miscellaneous injuries such as acute pancreatitis, burns, and uremia. Based on our SARS cases, we were able to show a correlation between pulmonary histological findings and the clinical course, with acute patterns of DAD seen in illnesses of 10 or fewer days\u2019 duration and organizing patterns of DAD seen in illnesses of more than 10 days\u2019 duration. So far, this contrast in histology based on duration of illness has not been emphasized in SARS. This finding generally fits with previously recognized concepts of histological phases of DAD in other settings.9, 10 Given that SARS-CoV has been identified as the cause of SARS,11 the etiology of DAD in these patients is presumably direct pulmonary epithelial infection by the SARS-CoV. However, the precise mechanism of alveolar wall damage remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "Some viruses can be identified in histological sections by their characteristic tissue response and cytopathic changes. For example, the combination of bronchiolar necrosis and smudge cells is virtually diagnostic of adenovirus pneumonia. Although SARS-CoV did not appear to produce a unique tissue response with characteristic cytopathic changes in this cohort, injury to bronchioles and alveolar epithelium was evident. Three of 4 patients with shorter illnesses demonstrated deposition of fibrin in bronchioles, accompanied by loss of cilia, bronchiole epithelial denudation, and focal deposition of fibrin along the exposed basement membrane, features similar to those described by Nicholls et al.12 The histological findings of bronchiolar injury correlated with small airway injury characterized by expiratory phase mosaic attenuation on high-resolution chest computed tomography in convalescing SARS patients (Yeun-Chung Chang, MD, and Jeffrey R. Galvin, MD, unpublished data). Interestingly, we saw strong pancytokeratin staining of hyaline membranes in the cases exhibiting acute-phase DAD. No type I or type II pneumocytes were evident on pancytokeratin immunostains beneath the hyaline membranes, suggesting massive type I pneumocyte necrosis. The paucity of pancytokeratin-positive cells lining alveolar walls on immunostaining in these 3 cases suggests that type I pneumocytes had been lost and the reparative function of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia had not yet started. These findings are consistent with recognized patterns of pneumocyte injury and proliferation in DAD,9, 10 as well as the recent description of pancytokeratin staining of hyaline membranes in DAD.13\n",

In the present study, hyperplastic type II pneumocytes showed rather striking cytological changes, including cytomegaly, nucleomegaly, clearing of nuclear chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and multinucleation. Ksiazek et al14 described cell rounding, a refractive appearance, and cell detachment in Vero E6 cells inoculated with oropharyngeal material from patients with SARS. Examination of the effected Vero E6 cells by electron microscopy revealed characteristic coronavirus particles within the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in vesicles. Although the cytological changes observed in our study may well be viral induced, specific light-microscopy markers of viral infection, such as intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions, were absent. Although severe and suspicious for direct viral effect, the cytological changes seen in our cases were within the spectrum of epithelial changes seen in non-SARS cases of DAD. In the absence of ancillary studies such as immunohistochemistry, the lack of a unique tissue response and cytopathic effect makes the diagnosis of SARS difficult at the light-microscopy level.",

In 1 case the multinucleated cells were also TTF-1 positive, further supporting the epithelial lineage of at least some multinucleated cells. Ksiazek et al14 have described multinucleated cells, or syncytia, in monolayers of Vero E6 cells infected with the new coronavirus.

In the latter group, cultures were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 case and for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in another case. Case 2, with a shorter course of illness, demonstrated invasive Mucor in the lung and a pseudomembraneous and superficially invasive Aspergillus tracheitis.
