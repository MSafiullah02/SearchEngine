This suggests, at least partly, an autoimmunology basis of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. A number of causal bases of autoimmunity from exposure to viral epitopes is well established, whether the route of administration be by exposure via infection or vaccination. Systemic respiratory viral infections can have numerous serious health effects, including dyspnea, hypoxemia, dysuria, meningitis, low blood pressure, shock and death. Sequalae of viral infections can include various short-term and sometimes permanent effects on the central nervous system, via direct injury to CNS tissue due to viral replication (viral neuropathology) or due to the host immune system learning to attack CNS tissue (viral neuroimmunopathology). The public health consequences from some viruses can include impaired immunity, encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases such as demyelinating disorders and relapsing events such as those seen in multiple sclerosis (MS).",

The etiology of the age-specific mortality seen in COVID-19 is largely unknown. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Other tissues are obviously also potential targets for viral immunopathology, including mucosal cells of the intestine, epithelial cells of the kidneys, brain cells (neurons), and cellular components of the immune system. In severe cases of SARS, and likely in SARS-CoV-2, this viral targeting leads acutely to pneumonia. Exposure to other viral and ambient antigens are known causal factors in chronic autoimmune diseases of the airways including asthma. The role of autoimmunity in enhancing the severity of secondary exposures following prior infection or vaccinations has been given little consideration.",

T-cells are trained to recognize a normal protein shape in the thymus.

Thus, the involvement of pathogenic priming in re-infection by COVID-19 is a theoretical possibility; of course no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has yet been tested in animals and therefore we do not yet know if pathogenic priming is in fact expected.
