The production of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) is one of these strategies and is used by many viruses (Miller and Koev, 2000). Another strategy is a translational read-through mechanism, in which a stop codon is skipped in-frame by a suppressor tRNA that can recognize the stop codon, and translation continues to produce a C-terminally extended protein (Lobanov et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Programmed \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshifting (\u2212 1 PRF) is a strategy to express a downstream ORF. In response to certain signals encoded in mRNA, a small percentage of ribosomes are induced to move back by one nucleotide and to continue translation in the new (\u2212 1) frame (Brierley, 1995, Giedroc and Cornish, 2009). As a result, a stop codon in the first ORF is skipped, and a C-terminally extended protein is produced at a certain ratio. This mechanism is used by many viruses, including those in Retroviridae, Nidovirales, astroviruses, Totiviridae, and Luteoviridae, to produce viral replicase protein (Brierley, 1995). Typically, \u2212 1 PRF requires two cis-acting RNA elements. The first element is a heptanucleotide sequence where the reading frame shifts. This sequence usually fits the consensus X XxY YYZ (the zero frame is indicated by a space; X is any identical base, Y is A or U, Z is not G, and lowercase indicates a consensus with some exceptions) (Dreher and Miller, 2006, Jacks et al., 1988). A second element is an RNA secondary structure immediately downstream from the shifty site (Brierley et al., 1989, Brierley and Pennell, 2001). This RNA structure is regarded as a physical barrier to stop translating ribosomes and to shift the reading frame (Namy et al., 2006). A pseudoknot or a very stable RNA structure is usually proposed for the second element (Giedroc and Cornish, 2009). In addition to these RNA elements, Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) requires a third RNA element that is located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (Paul et al., 2001). This far-downstream element is thought to base-pair with a bulge-loop in a stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site, where it facilitates frameshifting (Barry and Miller, 2002).",

Its genome comprises two positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecules, RNA1 and RNA2. Both genomic RNAs lack a cap structure at the 5\u2032 end (Mizumoto et al., 2003), and a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end (Lommel et al., 1988, Mizumoto et al., 2002, Xiong and Lommel, 1989). Instead, RNA1 contains an essential RNA element (3\u2032TE-DR1) that is required for cap-independent translation (Mizumoto et al., 2003). RNA1 encodes replicase component protein p27 and its N-terminally coincident but C-terminally distinct protein p88 (Xiong and Lommel, 1989). Both p27 and p88 are required for RNA replication and are contained in RCNMV RNA replicase complexes (Bates et al., 1995, Mine et al., 2010a, Mine et al., 2010b). RNA1 also encodes a coat protein that is expressed from sgRNA (Xiong et al., 1993a, Zavriev et al., 1996). RNA2 encodes a cell-to-cell movement protein (Xiong et al., 1993a).",

Several previous works identified two cis-acting RNA elements that are necessary and sufficient for \u2212 1 PRF in RCNMV RNA1. One element is the heptanucleotide sequence G GAU UUU, where frameshifting takes place (Kim and Lommel, 1994, Xiong et al., 1993b). The other element is a bulged stem-loop structure predicted to be adjacent to the shifty site (Kim and Lommel, 1998).

Our results show that a small stable stem-loop structure adjacent to 3\u2032TE-DR1 in the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 is required for efficient \u2212 1 PRF and that this stem-loop structure promotes \u2212 1 PRF via base-pairing with a bulge of the stem-loop structure adjacent to the shifty site.",

            "text": "Our previous study showed that several capped RNA1 mutants with deletions in the 3\u2032 UTR supported the accumulation of negative-strand RNA2 less efficiently than did the wild-type (wt) RNA1 in BYL, although these RNA1 mutants produced p27 to similar or even higher levels than did wt RNA1 (Iwakawa et al., 2007). This result suggests that the deleted regions are involved in the production of p88, which is translated via \u2212 1 PRF. To investigate whether the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 has the cis-acting RNA element(s) required for \u2212 1 PRF and the production of p88, we tested RNA1 mutants with a series of deletions in their 3\u2032 UTR (Figs. 1A and B, Iwakawa et al., 2007) for their ability to produce p88 in BYL. We used capped viral RNA transcripts because the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 contains RNA elements essential for cap-independent translation of both p88 and p27 (Iwakawa et al., 2007, Mizumoto et al., 2003). Capped RNA1 mutants were incubated in BYL at 17 \u00b0C for 4 h, and the accumulated levels of p27 and p88 were analyzed by western blotting using an anti-p27 antiserum. For this assay, we used the membrane fraction of BYL obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min because the level of p88 accumulated in BYL was below the detectable threshold (data not shown). An RNA1 mutant (R1-SM) that has mutations in the heptanucleotide shifty site was used as a negative control. d3\u2032SLB, d3\u2032SLC, and d3\u2032SLDE-5\u2032 accumulated lower levels of p88 than those accumulated in wt RNA1, whereas all the RNA1s tested accumulated p27 to similar levels (Fig. 1C, lanes 3\u20135). d3\u2032SLF that lacks the 3\u2032 terminal SL required for negative-strand synthesis (Iwakawa et al., 2007) accumulated p88 as efficiently as wt RNA1 (Fig. 1C, lane 7), suggesting that RNA replication, including negative-strand RNA synthesis and accumulations of dsRNAs, has no or little effects on the production of p88 via \u2212 1 PRF in BYL. These results suggest that the regions, including SLB, SLC, and SLDE, contain cis-acting RNA elements required for \u2212 1 PRF. To delimit the regions required for \u2212 1 PRF, we constructed RNA1 mutants with a series of deletions in the regions (Figs. 1A and D) and tested them as described above. Western blot analysis showed that the accumulated levels of p88 were much lower in RNA1 mutants with deletions in the stem of SLC than in wt RNA1 and in other RNA1 mutants despite their ability to accumulate p27 to a level similar to that in wt RNA1 (Fig. 1E, lanes 4 and 6). Deletions in SLB and SLDE affected the accumulation of p88 mildly (Fig. 1E, lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). Interestingly, deletion of 3\u2032TE-DR1c did not affect the accumulation of p88 (Fig. 1E, lane 5). This result suggests that the region of SLC, except for 3\u2032TE-DR1c, is involved in efficient \u2212 1 PRF.",

Five bases 897-GGGUA-901 in the bulge of the stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site (named here 5\u2032BulgeSL) can potentially base-pair to five bases 3562-UACCC-3566 in the loop sequence of SLCsSL (Fig. 5A). These long-distance base-pairings are possible in all dianthoviruses, although the sequences in the 5\u2032BulgeSL (831-AAGGUA-836) and the SLCsSL (3507-UACCUU-3512) of CRSV slightly differ from those of other dianthoviruses (Fig. 5A, data not shown). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5A, the RNA secondary structures of both 5\u2032BulgeSL and SLCsSL are quite similar to those of a bulged stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site and a stem-loop predicted in the 3\u2032 UTR of BYDV genomic RNA (Barry and Miller, 2002). Moreover, in BYDV, the long-distance base-pairing between them is required for efficient \u2212 1 PRF (Barry and Miller, 2002).",

These RNA1 mutants were analyzed in both BYL and BY-2 protoplasts as described above. 5\u2032BulgeSL-m1 and 5\u2032BulgeSL-m2 have mutations in the bulge of 5\u2032BulgeSL, 3\u2032SLCsSL-mLoop and 3\u2032SLCsSL-mLoop2 have mutations in the loop sequence of SLCsSL, and Restore-1 and Restore-2 have mutations in both the 5\u2032 bulge and the 3\u2032 loop, which restore the potential base-pairings between them (Fig. 5B). 5\u2032BulgeSL-m1 has the mutation in the central two bases that alters the amino acid sequence of p88, arginine to serine and valine to leucine at positions 259 and 260, respectively, but the mutation in 5\u2032BulgeSL-m2 does not alter it. All the RNA1 mutants with mutations that disrupt the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction accumulated much less p88 in BYL (Fig. 5C, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6) and failed to support the efficient accumulation of viral genomic RNAs in BY-2 protoplasts (Fig. 5D, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). By contrast, RNA1 mutants with mutations that restored the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction accumulated p88 as efficiently as did wt RNA1 in BYL (Fig. 5C, lanes 4 and 7) and supported the accumulation of viral genomic RNAs in BY-2 protoplasts (Fig. 5D, lanes 4 and 7). It should be noted that, although the C to U mutation in 3\u2032SLCsSL-mLoop2 still allows non-Watoson\u2013Crick base-pairing (G\u2013U), this mutation greatly reduced the accumulated level of p88 (Fig. 5C, lane 6). These results suggest that the stable long-distance RNA\u2013RNA base-pairing between 5\u2032BulgeSL and SLCsSL is required for efficient \u2212 1 PRF in RCNMV RNA1.",

            "text": "Long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interactions regulate various steps in the viral life cycle. For example, BYDV and Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) require RNA\u2013RNA base-pairings between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR to initiate translation (Fabian and White, 2004, Guo et al., 2001, Nicholson et al., 2010, Treder et al., 2008). Bacteriophage Q\u03b2 and TBSV require a long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction for RNA replication (Klovins et al., 1998, Panavas and Nagy, 2005). Viruses such as Potato virus X, Flock house virus, and Coronavirus require long-distance base-pairings for sgRNA transcription (Kim and Hemenway, 1999, Lindenbach et al., 2002, Moreno et al., 2008). In the case of RCNMV, an intermolecular RNA\u2013RNA interaction plays an essential role in sgRNA transcription (Sit et al., 1998). In addition to these roles, a long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction is required for \u2212 1 PRF in BYDV (Barry and Miller, 2002, Paul et al., 2001) and in RCNMV (Fig. 5). In many viruses, RNA pseudoknot structures predicted to be adjacent to the heptanucleotide shifty site alone seem sufficient for \u2212 1 PRF (Giedroc and Cornish, 2009). Such RNA pseudoknot structures are regarded as a physical barrier to stop translating ribosomes and facilitate \u2212 1 PRF (Namy et al., 2006). It is unclear why the downstream complex stem-loop structure (5\u2032BulgeSL) alone is not enough to facilitate \u2212 1 PRF in RCNMV RNA1 or in BYDV. Because the potential base-pairing between the bulge sequence and the large loop sequence within the 5\u2032BulgeSL, which could form an atypical pseudoknot, has no role in \u2212 1 PRF in RCNMV RNA1 (Kim and Lommel, 1998), 5\u2032BulgeSL might not be strong enough to stall the translating ribosomes efficiently. Kissing RNA\u2013RNA interactions between two stem-loops are more stable than a simple RNA helix of the same sequence (Weixlbaumer et al., 2004). Taking this into account, the long-distance base-pairings between the stem-loop in the 3\u2032 UTR and the 5\u2032BulgeSL seem to be required to stabilize the 5\u2032BulgeSL to allow for the stalling of the elongating ribosomes over the shifty site to promote \u2212 1 PRF in RCNMV RNA1.",

A model for the switch from translation to replication has been reported in BYDV, in that the passage of RNA replicase on the 3\u2032 UTR of the viral genome disrupts the structures of the 3\u2032 RNA elements, which are needed for two sets of the long-distance base-pairing required for cap-independent translation and \u2212 1 PRF (Barry and Miller, 2002).

The p88 bound in the 3\u2032 UTR might become a core for assembling the 480-kDa RNA replicase complexes with p27 and host proteins to initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis (Mine et al., 2010a, Mine et al., 2010b).

These previous results suggest that p27 is associated mainly with translating RNA1 with polyribosomes because puromycin, a peptidyl acceptor antibiotic, causes polypeptide chain termination and induces the dissociation of polyribosomes from mRNA (Blobel and Sabatini, 1971, Lehninger et al., 1993), and suggest that p27 does not bind to the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1. The lack of the association between p27 and the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 might allow translating RNA1 to continue to be a template for further translation for p27 until \u2212 1 PRF occurs by an unknown mechanism(s) that regulates the frequency of \u2212 1 PRF. Thus, the existence of RNA elements responsible for \u2212 1 PRF in the translation of p88 in the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 and the distinct binding properties between p27 and p88 might be important for regulating the ratio of p88 and p27.",

In this model, p27 interacts with its template RNA1 except for the 3\u2032 UTR. The production of sufficient amounts of p27 allows 5\u2032BulgeSL to access SLCsSL by an unknown mechanism. The formation of base-pairings between 5\u2032BulgeSL and SLCsSL facilitates the translation of p88 via \u2212 1 PRF. p88 interacts with the 3\u2032 UTR of its template RNA1. The interaction of p88 or the formation of the 480-kDa replicase complex disrupts the structures of the 3\u2032 RNA elements required for both cap-independent translation and \u2212 1 PRF, causing a switch from translation to replication of RCNMV RNA1.",

(A) At the early replication step, an auxiliary replicase protein p27 is produced via 3\u2032TE-DR1-mediated cap-independent translation. p27 interacts with translating RNA1 except for its 3\u2032 UTR (Iwakawa et al., 2011). The lack of the association of p27 with the 3\u2032 UTR containing 3\u2032TE-DR1 allows translating RNA1 to continue to be a template for p27. (B) Sufficient amounts of p27 on RNA1 allow 5\u2032BulgeSL to access SLCsSL by an unknown mechanism. (C) The interaction between 5'BulgeSL and SLCsSL facilitates the production of p88 via \u2212 1 PRF. (D) p88 binds to the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 through a translation-coupled manner by an unknown mechanism (Iwakawa et al., 2011). The p88 binding or the formation the 480-kDa replicase complex in the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 disrupts RNA structures required for both cap-independent translation and \u2212 1 PRF. The conformational change of RNA structure causes a switch from translation to replication of RNA1.",
