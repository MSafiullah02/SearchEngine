These are Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (referred to as COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or 2019-nCoV). All three have led to global health emergencies, with significant morbidity and mortality [2]. Before 2020, the largest outbreak was of SARS-CoV in 2003, which affected over 8000 individuals globally and was associated with 774 deaths (case fatality rate of 9.6%)i [3]. The overall cost to the global economy of SARS-CoV was estimated to be between US$30 billion and US$100 billion [4].",

With the predicted number of cases set to rise significantly, this represents a prodigious acute unmet medical need. Several national and international research groups are working collaboratively on a variety of preventative and therapeutic interventions. Potential avenues being explored include vaccine development, convalescent plasma, interferon-based therapies, small-molecule drugs, cell-based therapies, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [5]. However, drug therapy development is a costly and timely process with a high attrition rate [6]. The speed of the normal drug development pathway is unacceptable in the context of the current global emergency. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in repurposing existing drugs and expediting developmental antiviral treatments, such as those for influenza, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and filoviruses, to allow more rapid development [5]. The swift genomic sequencing of COVID-19 has facilitated this process, allowing comparison with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and other morbific viruses [7]. This strategy has identified several genomic regions of interest for therapeutic modulation, specifically the identification of highly conserved regions involving viral enzymes between different pathogenic coronaviruses.",

The logging of trials on registries has vastly facilitated the dissemination of information across several domains, including intervention, methodology, patient group, and outcome measures.

This search identified 100 studies that focused on forms of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), including herbal medicines, acupuncture and other forms of complementary medicine. These have not been further analysed due to a lack of scientific rationale, inadequate provision of information regarding active ingredients, and limited applicability to mainstream medical practice.

            "text": "As briefly mentioned earlier, many studies have focused on repurposing established antiviral therapies, especially those that showed prior efficacy against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir is the most common exploratory antiviral, appearing in 34 investigational studies (Table 1A: Antivirals). Both drugs function as protease inhibitors and are used extensively in the management of HIV-1 [9]. However, lopinavir has insufficient oral bioavailability for significant therapeutic activity, due to rapid catabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (specifically 3A4 isoenzyme) [9]. Thus, ritonavir is given concomitantly to inhibit this, significantly boosting the half-life of lopinavir. Lopinavir/ritonavir was investigated for efficacy against SARS-CoV in 2004 and found to be effective compared with a historical control [10]. However, efficacy was not seen in a randomised open-label study (see Glossary) (lopinavir/ritonavir versus standard care) in 199 patients with COVID-19 (Clinical Trial Number: ChiCTR2000029308, recruitment target stated as 160 participants in the registry; Table 1). No significant benefit was seen in either overall mortality or reduction in viral load [11]. The authors highlighted several limitations, including a lack of treatment blinding, with study participants and investigators being aware of treatment assignments, thus reducing study objectivity. While there are multiple other ongoing studies exploring lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19, none utilises a double-blind methodology to address this limitation.",

More recently, a nonrandomised open-label study examining the effect of hydroxychloroquine (EU Clinical Trial Numbervii: 2020-000890-25; recruitment target stated as 25 participants in the registry) reported on a cohort of 36 patients [17]. It reported a significant reduction in nasopharyngeal swab viral positivity 6 days after inclusion in the hydroxychloroquine group compared with control. However, in a deviation from their registry-described protocol, 16 patients were designated as controls and six patients received concurrent treatment with azithromycin to prevent bacterial superinfection. Selection of patients receiving azithromycin was based on clinical judgement. The subgroup receiving azithromycin all had negative viral swabs after 6 days compared with 57% (8/14) of hydroxychloroquine alone and 12.5% (2/16) of control [17]. This study is limited by its lack of randomisation and blinding, and small sample size. There is much interest in chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, with a further 34 studies registered (Table 1A: Antimalarials); however, only four report using a robust double-blind randomised controlled protocol to investigate efficacy.",

However, until recently, <5% of clinical trials for COVID-19 were registered in Europe (Figure 2). The rapid escalation of trial registrations in response to increasing disease incidence seen in China has unfortunately not occurred in Europe. Despite this, there are now encouraging signs. Initiatives focused on pan-European collaboration are being championed by the European Union with a priority on larger patient studies compared with the smaller studies registered in Chinax. Consequently, the median number of participants in European registered studies is 1200 participants, compared with 60 and 394 in China and USA, respectively. An example is NCT04303507 (chloroquine postexposure prophylaxis), which plans to recruit 10 000 participants (Table 1B). However, this may in part reflect a higher proportion of preventative studies currently being carried out that include large numbers of participants.
