Varying degrees of immunity and exposure may shift these distributions (30) . To examine whether the ongoing outbreak shifted from an epidemic concentrated in Wuhan and among travelers from Wuhan to an epidemic that was self-sustained in provinces across China we use age and sex data from different periods of the outbreak for individuals with reported travel history and no known travel history. We define two periods of the outbreak, an \"early\" phase, starting with the first reports in early December and ending a set number of days after the Wuhan shutdown. This was selected to be 8 days after the Wuhan shutdown, which conservatively corresponds to one incubation period + 1SD (see above) after the shutdown. After that date (i.e. 1 st Feb 2020; the \"later\" phase) we assume that most reported transmissions in provinces outside of Wuhan are the result of local transmission. We further divided our data in those that had cases with known travel history to Wuhan and those who did not. Then we produce the following summary statistics: We cannot exclude the possibility that shifts in distributions may be due to heightened awareness among the general population which may have increased reporting in female cases later in the epidemic. Further, more work will be necessary to understand the differential risk of severe or symptomatic disease to fully understand the age and sex distributions in this outbreak. For example, why there are relatively few reports of cases <18y old. However, as for other respiratory pathogens symptomatic and severe infection were more concentrated in older populations. We do not intend to make any general statements about differential risk but were more interested in shifts in reported cases across multiple geographies in China.",

In particular, two pieces of information are collected. First, we extract a series of migration scale indices for traveling out of Wuhan, from January 1st to February 10, both in 2019 and 2020. Second, we obtain the proportion of human movement from Wuhan were bound for each of 31 provinces in China. These proportions are available for January 1st -February 10, 2020. Based on this data we had access to both changes in mobility volume and changes in mobility direction. See more detailed descriptions of the human movement data here: (32, 33) .

Models were fit to province-level data. The three models were compared using differences in Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), where larger values indicate models with lower relative support, and BIC>4 considered the cutoff for substantial model improvement. We performed a detailed sensitivity analysis on the availability of RT-qPCR tests, doubling time, and incubation periods. We obtained qualitatively similar results for Model 1 (Poisson GLM fit to daily case counts), Model 2 (negative binomial GLM fit to daily case counts), and Model 3 (loglinear regressions fit to cumulative cases), see Table S2 . In addition, we provide a full time series analysis of the optimal lag structure for cases and mobility for each province. Additionally, although BIC is considered more conservative, model selection results were confirmed using AIC for model selection (see Fig. 4 and Table S2 ). Lastly, we validated our model selection results using elastic-net regression and n-fold cross validation as implemented in the R package GLMNET v. 2.0-18 (35, 36) .",

Epidemiologic history: (1) within 2 weeks of symptom onset, travel or resident history in Wuhan region or other places with sustained local transmission; (2) within 2 weeks of symptom onset, contact with persons from Wuhan city or other places with sustained local transmission who had fever with respiratory symptoms, (3) belong to a cluster or epidemiologic connection with COVID-19 infected persons.Confirmed: Need to satisfy criteria for probable case and have a RT-qPCR positive result from respiratory or blood samples, or genome sequencing highly similar with known SARS-CoV-2.available strains from lab test of respiratory or blood samples.Comparing predictive models of epidemic trajectoriesTo evaluate hypotheses regarding the effect of mobility and testing on COVID-19 dynamics, we fit three different Generalized Linear Models (GLM). Model 1 was a Poisson GLM to estimate daily case counts, Model 2 was a negative binomial GLM to estimate daily case counts, andModel 3 was a log-linear regression to estimate daily cumulative cases. BIC scores shown in Fig. 4b are calculated on a GLM of the form Y(t) = Y(t-4) + IT(t) + M(t-5) + IM(t) where Y(t) is either the number of new cases observed on day t (Model 1 & 2) or cumulative number of cases observed through day t (Model 3), Y(t-4) represents the number of cases (or the cumulative number under Model 3) four days prior (median doubling time outside Hubei province), IT(t) isan indicator function for RT-qPCR test availability that is 1 after 19th January 2020 and 0 before, M(t-5) is the Baidu Inc-estimated mobility between Wuhan and each province 5 days prior (median incubation period), and IM(t) is an indicator function which is set to 1 after 26th",

Relative importance of RT-qPCR testing vs. human mobility to improve a simple GLM of COVID-19 when estimating exponential growth in province-level cases. Relative improvement is measured as one minus the residuals of a GLM with lagged cases + RT-qPCR testing availability (y-axis) and a GLM with lagged cases + mobility from Wuhan. Values were normalized by the observed number of cases such that they ranged between 0 and 1. The resulting metric has a value of 0 for a model where the residual error vastly eclipses the observed data and a value of 1 when residual error is 0, i.e., a perfect model fit.

As seen with the AIC/BIC-based model selection, the regularized model included terms for lagged cases, the mobility and testing indicator variables, and mobility out of Wuhan. The out-of-sample log likelihood for the regularized Poisson regression was -9102and was -22519 for the negative binomial model. The significantly worse fit for the negative binomial model was primarily driven by two outlier predictions, removing those results in an out-of-sample log likelihood for the negative binomial model of -11625.
