Thus, patients completing the second extension had been taking omalizumab for 3 years. The study showed that omalizumab is both effective and safe. There was a persistent therapeutic effect in the current extension. The increases in forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV 1 ) from baseline seen in Extension 1 were maintained in Extension 2, indicating that lung function improved. The improvement was accompanied by sustained decreases in inhaled corticosteroid use.

Professor Partridge emphasised that patients do not increase their inhaled corticosteroid sufficiently and they increase their inhaled corticosteroid relatively late into the exacerbation.
