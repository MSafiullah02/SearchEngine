The cause of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is identified as a novel betacoronavirus, named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome has been almost entirely driven by 2019-nCoV via respiratory droplets, human-to-human transmission, posing pandemic potential with unfortunate characteristics of strong infectiousness, rapid dissemination, long incubation period, and general susceptibility [[3], [4], [5]]. In subsequent months, the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading globally and declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) [[6], [7], [8]]. As of April 4, 2020, more than 200 countries sufferred from the expansive spread of the virus 2019-nCoV in a global pandemic with massive and urgent crisis on healthcare, economic and social systems [[9], [10], [11], [12]], there were over one million confirmed cases with COVID-19 worldwide, of these, a total of 277,965 subjects were from the United States [[13], [14]]. According to official release on April 4, 2020 by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, more than 80,000 cases had been confirmed as COVID-19 with 3326 death cases [15].",

In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia was deemed to the category of \u201cPestilence\u201d, and the characteristics of its pathogenesis was \u201cdampness, toxin, stasis and closure\u201d [[19], [20]]. Over the past few months, TCM exhibited remarkable benefits against COVID-19 in China, and it was convinced that TCM achieved satisfactory therapeutic superiority for patients infected by 2019-nCoV with regard to preventive treatment of diseases, comprehensive therapies and rehabilitation by the accumulation of clinical experience and scientific evidence [[21], [22]]. As recommended in the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Revised 7th version) which was officially released by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, TCM could exert favorable effects for patients with different syndromes and distinct stages of COVID-19, contributing to infections in the periods of both medical observation and clinical treatment [23]. Recently, the latest official data showed that 91.5% of confirmed subjects with COVID-19 (74,187 cases) received TCM in China, and increasing results of clinical observation indicated that the total effective rate of TCM reached more than 90% [24]. These promising advantages were associated with its unique therapeutic principles including syndrome differentiation and treatment, boosting the individual's endogenous healing ability, balancing Yin and Yang, various therapies and personalized treatment in first-line clinic [[25], [26]].",

Compared to herbal decoction, CPMs had the advantages of stable quality, curative efficacy, considerable safety, rapid absorption, high bioavailability, convenience of taking, carrying and storing [[29], [30]]. Similarly, as an indispensable part of TCM, CPMs were substantial utilized in combination with western medicine for the management of COVID-19, and proposed as adjunctive and therapeutic options to fight the public health emergency of 2019-nCoV by national and provincial guidelines in China [[31], [32], [33]]. Given the paucity of published English research concerning CPMs against COVID-19 currently, the present review performed a descriptive analysis of recommended CPMs from both clinical trials and published literatures, based on the following aspects: information retrieved from their instructions (compositions, therapeutic effects, and clinical indications), medical evidence, pharmacodynamic mechanism, dominant components, applicable patients, clinical cautions and so on. As regarding to some types of CPMs without accessible published evidence for treating 2019-nCoV, we introduced the relevant results of infectious or health-threatening diseases. The aim of present review was to provide the scientific basis and share clinical experiences for promising choices of CPMs against COVID-19.",

Besides, some research demonstrated its characteristics of multi-target and multi-pathway in treating COVID-19 based on the approaches of network pharmacology and molecular docking. Among a series of involved signaling pathways, such as HIF-1 and PI3K-Akt were represented pathways against COVID-19 in terms of lung inflammation, virus infection and lung injury. Besides, core targets including TNF, MAPK1, JUN, IL6, STAT3, EGFR, etc. were closely correlation with the inhibition of cytokine storm in severe cases, and fatal risk of cytokine storms in the immune system of serious patients might result in organ failure and even death [[68], [69], [70]].",

Based on unique guiding principles of syndrome differentiation and treatment in TCM, its clinical superiority had considerable recognition and public acclaim in the furious battle for 2019-nCoV, the cumulative number of research revealed that its curative advantages involved in whole treatment process, namely prevent disease progression, alleviate clinical symptoms, improve the hospital stay and negative results of nucleic acid detection, and promote the physical recovery [[21], [22],101]. Notably, the majority of enrolled CPMs possessed the medical history approximately 20 years in clinical practice among Chinese citizens, therefore, the clinical applications of CPMs to tackle the epidemic were with definite therapeutic effects, clinical basis, social recognition and other superior factors. For example, Huoxiang Zhengqi Capsule and Lianhua Qingwen Capsule was over-the-counter medicines, and some CPMs were covered by national lists of essential medicine and basic insurance program in China.",

For instance, phillyrin, the natural lignan of Lianqiao, had antibacterial, anti-quorum sensing and anti-inflammatory activities for the control of infectious pathogens via the regulation the MyD88/I\u03baB\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, decrease the virus titers and I\u03baB\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 levels, reduction the expression of influenza hemagglutinin protein, and attenuation of lung tissue damage [[102], [103], [104]]. With regard to severe cases, the Chinses herbal injections could obviously alleviate clinical symptoms and correct complications. In particular, Xuebijing injection was widely used for treating patients with critical diseases including sepsis, severe pneumonia, severe acute pancreatitis, infection-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ARDS, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and so on [[104], [105]]. Moreover, our study highlighted that its clinical beneficial effects in severe cases was closely associated with the inhibition of cytokine storm, improve virus infection and lung injury, superior binding activities with 3CLpro and ACE2. In addition, three types of recommended herbal injectable dosage forms contained Hongshen (Ginseng Radix Et Rhizoma Rubra), ginseng was generally known for its tonic properties, and previous findings also suggested it might be a promising supplemental remedy against infectious diseases, this administration of ginseng could fast and accurate adjust excess or deficiency between Yin or Yang and restore their balance among critical patients [[106], [107], [108]].",

            "text": "When great attention was paid to the application of TCM in real-world, there were growing concerns related to the potential toxicity or inevitable ADRs of herbal medicines. The results of pharmacovigilance pointed out the risk factors of ADRs triggered by TCM including responsible Chinese materia medica, susceptible patients and clinical administration [109]. In this regard, our research should emphasize the following aspects, including poisonous composition, the safety status of Chinese herbal injection, special population, and irrational drug use. First, Angong Niuhuang Pill contained cinnabar (HgS) and realgar (As2S2) which were correlated to hepatorenal toxicity [110]. Fuzi (Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia) in Shenfu Injection was associated with narrow therapeutic window, its cardiac ADRs has been frequently observed that mainly manifested as palpitations, hypotension, arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and even shock [[111], [112]]. Second, compared with other dosage forms of TCM medications, Chinese herbal injections were associated with the higher risk of ADRs, especially serious side effects [[113], [114]]. Therefore, during the treatment of COVID-19, corresponding measures including drug safety monitoring and risk management for CPMs should be strengthened to achieve optimal benefits and minimal hazards. Third, the available evidence highlighted that special population including children, gravida and elderly people were particularly vulnerable to unfavorable drug responses, because their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles differed from the general population [115]. Indeed, clinical medication was complicated, the irrational uses reflected in misuse or abuse application of CPMs, overdose, repeated medication, dissolvant mismatch, pharmacologic antagonism, pharmaceutical incompatibility, herb-drug interaction and inappropriate syndrome differentiations and so on, these factors all would be culminating in drug-induced risk. The selection of treatments for individuals infected 2019-nCoV should be consistent with the theory of TCM. For example, it was not suitable to receive tonic herbs and Lianhua Qiwen Capsule for cases with COVID-19 simultaneously. Besides, Huoxiang Zhengqi Liquid contained ethanol, which could cause disulfiram-like reaction combined with cephazolin, cefoperazone, cefoperazone and sulbactam, latamoxef and so on [116]. To overall contain the COVID-19 pandemic, except for support medication and equipment supply, we suggested that pharmacists should play important role in the guarantee of medication safety including prescription checking and the rational use of CPMs.",
