In neonatal piglets, PEDV can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting, thereby leading to dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and death (Pospischil et al., 2002, Pensaert, 1999). Clinical outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea were first reported in 1971 in England, with its viral etiology determined in 1978 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978, Wood, 1977). Previously free of the virus, outbreaks of PEDV in North America were first reported in April 2013 (Alvarez et al., 2016, Stevenson et al., 2013). Spreading rapidly across the continent, PEDV caused a 6\u20137% decline in U.S. pork production in 2014 (Alvarez et al., 2015).",

            "text": "In the field, it has been observed that prior exposure of the sow herd to PEDV ameliorates the impact of PEDV infection in neonates, presumably via maternal immune mechanisms (Goede and Morrison, 2016). Based on these observations, it has been postulated that PEDV-specific IgG and IgA in colostrum and milk are critical for the protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV (Chattha et al., 2015, Song et al., 2015). Using TGEV as a model, the assumption is that lactogenic immunity against PEDV is induced by enteric infection following oral exposure (Song et al., 2007). Thereafter, IgA plasmablasts stimulated in the sow's gut migrate to the intestinal lamina propria and then to the mammary glands where they produce PEDV-specific IgA (Bohl et al., 1972a, Saif et al., 1972). Lactogenic IgA is effective within the intestinal tract of the neonatal pig because it has high affinity and is resistant to proteolysis (Song et al., 2015). However, as discussed by Langel et al. (2016), there are no published reports on the role of lactogenic antibody in the protection of piglets against PEDV. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to quantify the effect of lactogenic immunity in PEDV-inoculated piglets by comparing viral shedding, piglet growth, thermoregulation, and survival in litters with PEDV-immune vs na\u00efve dams.",

To verify their PEDV status, serum samples collected on DPI -7 were tested for PEDV antibody by PEDV fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) assay and a PEDV whole-virus indirect ELISA. To verify the absence of acute coronavirus infection, fecal swabs were collected immediately prior to receipt of animals and tested for PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) using agent-specific qRT-PCRs. Animals were housed throughout the experiment in the Iowa State University Livestock Infectious Disease Isolation Facility (LIDIF), a BSL-2 research facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). The facility is equipped with a single-pass non-recirculating ventilation system that provided directional flow from low contamination areas to high contamination areas and zones of negative pressure to prevent airborne contamination from area-to-area or room-to-room. Each room was ventilated separately and humidity and temperature was strictly controlled. Animals were closely observed (multiple times daily) from the time they entered LIDIF to the end of the observation period by researchers, animal caretakers, and veterinary staff.",

The inoculum used in this study was the 7th passage of the virus on cell culture. For this study, the virus was serially propagated on Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) in flasks using methods described elsewhere (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Chen et al., 2014). In brief, Vero cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-81\u2122, American type culture collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks (Corning\u00ae, Corning, NY) using maintenance medium (minimum essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies), 10 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies), 10 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin (Sigma-Aldrich).

Flasks were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 2 h to allow virus adsorption, after which 5 ml of post-inoculation medium was added to each flask without removing viral inoculum. Flasks were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 until cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed and then subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle (\u221280 \u00b0C).

Cell numbers and types reflect both the developmental stage of the mammary gland and the physiological and/or immunological conditions of the sow (Magnusson et al., 1991). After ingestion by piglets, maternally-derived lymphocytes are able to cross the duodenal and jejunal epithelium by intercellular migration for at least one week after birth (Bianchi et al., 1999, Tuboly et al., 1988, Williams, 1993). Once absorbed, these cells migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes and a variety of other tissues, including liver, lung, spleen, the lamina propria, and submucosal spaces of the duodenum and jejunum (Tuboly et al., 1988, Tuboly and Bernath, 2002, Williams, 1993). Thus, peripheral blood mononuclear T-lymphocytes and peripheral B-lymphocytes in piglets that received colostral cells showed higher responses to mitogens compared to controls (Williams, 1993). Research on the role of colostral immune cells in protecting piglets against coronaviruses is scant, but the transfer of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adult pigs into neonates was shown to delay the onset of TGEV enteritis (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984). The effects of colostral immune cells were not accounted for in this study, but maternal CMI may have been contributed to the protection against PEDV infection observed in Group 2 suckling pigs.",

This switch coincides with lower IgG and higher IgA concentrations in mammary secretions (Ash and Heap, 1975, Devillers et al., 2004a, Devillers et al., 2004b, Foisnet et al., 2010). After parturition, lactogenic immunity predominantly involves secretory IgA (S-IgA) produced from plasma cells in mammary gland tissues. Beginning shortly before parturition and continuing throughout lactation, IgA plasma cells preferentially migrate from mesenteric lymph nodes to the mammary glands (Roux et al., 1977). Mammary gland lymphocyte accumulation differs between gilts and sow, i.e. multiparous sows have more mammary tissue and are able to accumulate more plasma cells than primiparous females (Bischof et al., 1994, Sordillo et al., 1997, Sordillo and Streicher, 2002). Therefore, sows produce higher concentrations of S-IgA in mammary secretions (Cabrera et al., 2012, Klobasa et al., 1986). Like S-IgA, secretory IgM (S-IgM) is produced from IgM plasma cells in mammary gland tissues (Sordillo et al., 1997), but the mechanisms that regulates S-IgM plasma cell localization postpartum are not clear. (Note that multiparous sows were used in this study).",

            "text": "The enhancement of lactogenic immunity against enteric coronaviruses requires \u201cproductive\u201d enteric viral replication to stimulate the development of specific IgA plasmablasts, to increase in cell trafficking from the gut to the mammary gland, and to enhance the immunoglobulin production and secretion in milk (Langel et al., 2016). Thus, parenteral immunization of sows with modified-live TGEV vaccines increased IgG in colostrum, but not IgA (Saif and Jackwood, 1990, Bohl et al., 1972a, Saif et al., 1972). Following enteric infection, IgA plasmablasts migrate to the mammary glands where they contribute S-IgA to milk and colostrum (Bohl et al., 1972a, Roux et al., 1977). Bohl et al. (1972b) found that sows orally inoculated with virulent TGEV produced high titers of S-IgA in mammary secretions and protected their piglets against the clinical effects of TGEV, whereas highly attenuated oral TGEV vaccines resulted in lower S-IgA antibody titers in mammary secretions and inadequate lactogenic immunity in suckling piglets (Jackwood et al., 1995, Moxley and Olson, 1989, Saif, 1999a, Saif, 1999b). Thus, amongst the PEDV immune sows (group 2) used in this study, sows were previously exposed to PEDV orally through feed-back. Notably, significant differences were found among litters from PEDV-immune dams in the quantity of virus shedding (p\n \n<\n \n0.05) and return to normal body temperature (p\n \n<\n \n0.05), but not in piglet survival rate. Although these differences were detected, it was not possible to assign a causal role to antibody isotype or concentration in mammary secretions because of sample size. In addition, some potentially contributing factors were not accounted for, e.g., the amount of colostrum or milk consumed by each pig and the role of CMI. Given that the ultimate goal of this line of research is to provide specific guidelines for monitoring and maintaining lactogenic immunity against PEDV infection in sow herds, these remain important topics for future research.",

Upon reaching the luminal side of the epithelial cell, the pIgR molecule is enzymatically cleaved; a process that leaves a receptor fragment (\u201csecretory component\u201d) attached to the immunoglobulin molecule (Hunziker and Kraehenbuhl, 1998). The secretory component functions to protect the hinge region of S-IgA and S-IgM from protease cleavage, thereby extending their stability on mucosal surfaces (Hurley and Theil, 2011). The concentration of S-IgA and S-IgM in milk is dependent upon the rate of transportation across epithelial cells, but the rate of transport is dependent upon the expression of pIgR on mammary epithelial cells, which is under the control of hormones responsible for the initiation of lactation (Rosato et al., 1995, Scicchitano et al., 1986, Sheldrake et al., 1984). In sows, the hormonal regulation of the expression of pIgR on mammary epithelial cells has not been described, although it is known that pIgR density is highest from 0 to 3 days postpartum (Schnulle and Hurley, 2003).",

It has been reported that sows chemically induced to farrow trended toward the production of less colostrum and that the colostrum contained less fat (Farmer and Quesnel, 2009, Jackson et al., 1995, Milon et al., 1983). This is relevant because the sows in this study were induced to farrow using dinoprost tromethamine (Lutalyse\u00ae), a tromethamine salt of prostaglandin F2 alpha, on day 113 of gestation. It is possible that this procedure may have impacted the concentration and total quantity of colostral antibody. Although the results of this study showed that induction of sows did not affect the overall capacity of lactogenic humoral immunity to protect piglets against PEDV, this may be a consideration in the field when optimization of herd immunity against PEDV is an objective.",

In addition, IgG appears in the neonatal circulatory system within 48 h after birth (Curtis and Bourne, 1973, Porter et al., 1988, Watson, 1980). Depending on the sow's antibody profile, circulating maternal IgG can ameliorate the clinical effects of systemic infections, e.g., porcine parvovirus, porcine circovirus, and (Langel et al., 2016, Ostanello et al., 2005). Using a passive antibody model, Poonsuk et al. (2016) found that PEDV-inoculated neonates with circulating anti-PEDV antibodies returned to normal body temperature earlier and exhibited higher survivability compared to piglets without PEDV antibody. Although circulating antibody did not neutralize the negative effects of PEDV on growth nor reduce shedding of PEDV in feces, the results implied that colostral IgG contributed to the protection of neonates against PEDV.",
