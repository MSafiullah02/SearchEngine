Limited data support viral shedding in asymptomatic patients while increased levels of viral shedding may be more pronounced in those critically ill [28] [29] [30] .

Approximately 3.8% of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 occurred in healthcare personnel, and 14.6% of these cases were either severe or critical [34] . To be classified as severe, the following characteristics were required: PaO2/FiO2 b 300, oxygen saturation \u2264 93%, presence of N50% lung infiltrates within 24-48 h, respirations \u226530 breaths/min, or dyspnea [34] . Critical patients, defined as those with septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction/failure, and/or respiratory failure, accounted for approximately 5% of the study population with a case fatality rate of 49.0% [34, 24] . The highest case fatality rate was observed in those older than 80 years (14.8%) [34] .
