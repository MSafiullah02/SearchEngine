The authors reported the X-ray structure of unliganded SARS-CoV-2 Mpro\nand its complex with \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor after a modification from the previously designed inhibitor through incorporating P3-P2 amide bond into pyridone ring so as to increase its half-life in plasma. Finally the authors demonstrated that the crystal structure of Mpro\nprovides a basis for designing of a potent inhibitor to the protease with a marked tropism to the lung and with ease of administration through inhalation.",

The world health organization (WHO) named the disease \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and declared it as a world health emergency pandemic. Studying the crystal structure of targets for treatment is very crucial to know the mechanism of action of prospective drugs. A structural study on the coronavirus main protease 3CLpro inhibitor complex established designing of broad-spectrum halomethyl ketone inhibitors to the Coronaviridae family and demonstrated that these inhibitors form a thioether linkage with high affinity to the target3. Hilgenfeld\u2019s group reported earlier that a structure-based design of peptidomimetic \u03b1-ketoamides are also effective broad-spectrum inhibitors to the main and 3C protease of coronaviruses and enteroviruses as demonstrated by crystal structure of inhibitor-protease complex4. The 3CL protease of coronaviruses facilitates viral assembly by cleaving polyproteins and most active compounds prevent disease progression by inhibiting viral proteases 5.",

In order to confirm this, the authors solved the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 at 1.75 \u00c5 resolution and found that the crystal structure is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV Mpro only with a 0.53 \u00c5 r.m.s difference between the two free enzymes. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro forms a tight dimer and has a contact interface mainly between domain II of molecule A and the NH2-terminal residues of molecule B where this dimerization is important for catalytic activity. Unlike SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV Mpro dimer has a polar interaction between the two domains III involving a 2.60 \u00c5 hydrogen bond between the side chain hydroxyl groups of Thr285 of each protomer which is also supported by a hydrophobic interaction between the side chain of Ile286 and Thr285. In SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, threonine is replaced with alanine and isoleucine with leucine. As suggested by authors, Alanine replacements change the enzyme dynamics and increase its catalytic activity by allowing the two domains III to be in a close contact; although, the catalytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was only slightly higher with similar Kd of dimer dissociation (~2.5 \u03bcM).",

Further the binding of 13a with plasma proteins was reported to decrease to 97% as compared to 11r which showed 99% binding activity with plasma proteins. Provided these improvements, the structural modification resulted in loss of some inhibitory activities against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and 3C proteases of enteroviruses as evidenced by increased IC50 value.",

The authors determined the X-ray structure of \u03b1-ketoamide 13b and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex at 1.95 and 2.20 \u00c5 resolution. In one of the structures, the authors found that the key residue, Glu166, forms inactive conformation in protomer B while the 13b compound is bound in the same fashion as in molecule A.

Hilgenfeld\u2019s group assessed the pharmacokinetics of 13a and 13b and found that the absorption-distribution-metabolism-excretion of both compounds was similar with a 90% binding to human plasma proteins. The 13b showed less clearance compared to 13a and good tropism to the lungs with a well-tolerated administration through inhalation in mice. Taken together, the authors designed \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors with improved inhibition efficiency against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to suppress disease progression (Fig. 1). Their work provides insights into the development of more potent pyridone containing anti-coronaviral drugs. Future structural-functional studies are recommended to improve the efficacy of targeted therapies to tackle the emerging pandemics due to coronaviruses.",

The process of translation yields polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved to the main protease Mpro and nonstructural proteins (nsps). Mpro is involved in the producing of nsps. Nsps is essential for assembling the viral replication transcription complex (RTC) to engage in RNA synthesis. Once inhibitors, such as 11r, 13a, and 13b, act in the cell, they bind to Mpro and inhibit the activity of this enzyme, resulting in failure of virion assembly. Ultimately, host cell fails to release the new intact virions. Colored box highlight the modifications from 11r to 14b. Due to lacking Boc group, 14b could not cross the cellular membrane to inhibit viral replication",
