IBDV has a bisegmented double\u2010stranded RNA genome (segments A and B) 2. The large ORF of the segment A encodes a polyprotein that can undergo cotranslational self\u2010proteolytic processing and release three polypeptides, the precursor capsid protein (pVP2), the protease VP4 and the multifunctional polypeptide VP3. The small ORF in segment A encodes a nonstructural protein VP5 with a molecular weight of 17 kDa. Segment B contains a single ORF encoding the RdRp VP1 polypeptide. In 2007, a cDNA microarray was used to analyze the differentially abundant transcripts of IBDV\u2010infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), which provides an overview of the mRNA profiles of cells during virus infection 3. However, mRNA is not always the same with the protein level. Consequently, potential cellular factors involved in viral infection are more likely obtained from the proteomic profile of the host cellular response.",

In the past few years, iTRAQ has been used to explore and discover previously unidentified factors in the cell proteomic response to infection with porcine circovirus type 2 15, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 16, human immunodeficiency virus 1 17, human papilloma virus 18, simian immunodeficiency virus 19 and influenza virus 20. However, iTRAQ was rarely used to determine the subcellular proteomic response to IBDV infection. In this study, we utilized an iTRAQ\u2010based quantitative subcellular proteomics approach followed by bioinformatic analysis and Western blot coupled with quantitative real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR and colocalization assays to observe the differentially abundant proteins profiles of IBDV\u2010infected cells at 24 h after inoculation. We find that viral infection regulates the abundance and/or subcellular localization of more than 1000 host proteins in either the nuclear or the cytoplasmic fraction at the early phase of infection. These data provide clues to further understanding the replication and pathogenesis of IBDV and virus\u2013host interactions.",

In the current work, we used a subcellular iTRAQ proteomic approach to characterize differentially abundant proteins in the cytoplasmic/nuclear fractions of IBDV\u2010infected DF\u20101 cells. Comparative analysis of the results by MS revealed that in the cytoplasmic proteome of virus\u2010infected cells, altered cellular proteins included 17 increased proteins in abundance and six decreased proteins in abundance. In the nuclear proteome, 34 altered cellular proteins were identified, including 14 increased proteins in abundance and 20 decreased proteins in abundance. Additionally, IFA showed the interplay between the viral protein VP3 and cellular protein NF45. Clearly, further studies are necessary to understand the roles of the altered cellular proteins in IBDV infection.

Recently, progress was made in identifying how IFIT proteins inhibit through distinct mechanisms of action, and the replication of multiple families of viruses 36, such as hepatitis C virus 37, influenza A virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus 38. One of the IFIT family genes, IFIT5 (ISG58), is involved in anti\u2010viral responses through enhancing innate immune signaling pathways 27. In the present study, IFIT5 was revealed to be increased in abundance during IBDV infection (increased \u223c2.001\u2010fold in the cytoplasmic fraction). Therefore, it is conceivable that IFIT5 may be an important modulator in the antivial innate immune response during IBDV infection. STAT1 is a downstream target of the IFN pathway, which is central to the regulation of immune responses in viral invasion. Type I IFN binds to a common IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor that initiates a signaling cascade that results in the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and the induction of the expression of hundreds of IFN\u2010stimulated genes 33, 39.

Moreover, confocal microscopy analysis showed colocalization of hnRNP H1 protein with the viral protein VP3 in the cytoplasm of IBDV\u2010infected cells (Fig. 6B). VP3 has multiple functions that contribute to efficient virus replication 45. Therefore, we hypothesized that the increased abundance of hnRNP H1 may play an important role in the replication of IBDV. Among the differentially abundant proteins, we also found decrease in abundance of cellular proteins associated with RNA processing and biosynthesis, including 60S ribosomal protein l5 (RPL5, for RNA binding) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2, operates the metabolic coordination between cytosol and mitochondria). Notably the proteomic data further revealed that the key glycolytic enzymes, including aldolase C (ALDOC), were extensively decreased in abundance.

NF45/NF90 heterodimeric protein complex have involved multitudinous functions, one of the functions was transferred from the nuclear to the cytoplasm in many different cell types 53. In the infected DF\u20101 cells, we found predominantly the NF45 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 6). In addition, we also found that NF45 colocalized with VP3 and translocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm during IBDV infection (Fig. 6). This observation was similar to a previous observation of IBDV infection at 12 hpi 54 and consistent with the conclusion that the cytoplasmic accumulation of NF45 as a consequence of the viral infection occurs independently from the expression of IFN\u2010regulated genes.",

API5 is an antiapoptotic protein that is increased in abundance in various cancer cells, the roles of API5 may be to mediate protein\u2013protein interactions 55. Morris et al. 56 reported that API5 play an important role in dE2F1\u2010induced apoptosis. Proviral integration of moloney virus\u20102 can activate API5 through phosphorylation mechanism in order to inhibit the apoptosis of liver cells, and NF\u2010\u03baB is the key regulator in this antiapoptotic pathway 57. The antioxidant stress protein PRDX4 was decreased in abundance, suggesting that IBDV\u2010infected inhibits host cell oxidative stress. Virus\u2010induced oxidative stress is associated with the activation of phagocytosis and the release of reactive oxygen that positively modulate the immune activation and eradicate viral infection and immune\u2010induced cellular injury 58. Moreover, Tavender et al. 59 found that PRDX4, an endoplasmic reticulum localized peroxiredoxin and known to play an important role in disulfide formation, can be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.",

It has been reported to function as a chaperone in the viral chromatin assembly process in infected cells 62. This shuttling of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm is now recognized as a key mechanism for ensuring proper cell cycle progression 63. In previous report, others have identified NPM as a novel p53\u2010independent target of the ARF tumor suppressor protein 64.
