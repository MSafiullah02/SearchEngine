A second was to focus on the nucleic acid genome as the primary criterion for classification. Viral genomes take a variety of forms: DNA or RNA, double stranded or single stranded, segmented or not, plus (+) or minus (\u2212) polarity, circular or linear. The smallest genomes have a few thousand nucleotides (kb) containing genes for a structural protein and a few essential enzymes. Other larger viruses have genomes of more than 200 kb that include complex regulatory elements. The overall taxonomic system identified four characteristics to be used in the classification of all viruses:\u2022nature of the nucleic acid in the virion;\u2022symmetry of the capsid;\u2022presence or absence of an outer lipid envelope;\u2022dimensions of the virion and capsid.\n",

Efforts have focused on developing live-attenuated intranasally administered RSV and PIV vaccines.8 Historically, vaccines against these two viruses, based on inactivated virus or purified proteins, have been associated with more severe disease in vaccinees; live vaccines appear to induce immunity without disease enhancement. The attenuated viruses are currently designed in vitro by using reverse genetics technology, where infectious virus is produced entirely from cDNA. Pre-determined changes in the nucleotide sequence can be introduced into infectious virus by way of the cDNA intermediate.9 By using this technology, it may also be possible to create a chimeric vaccine strain that has genes, for example, for several different paramyxovirus F proteins.",

The antigenic differences of the HA and NA glycoproteins provide the basis of the classification of influenza sub-types.

Similarly, quantitation of HHV-6, 7 and 8 DNA is being investigated to define their pathogenic role. Clinical cut-offs or threshold values for appearance of clinical symptoms are being defined for CMV and for Epstein-Barr virus. These values represent the basis for the selection of limits of viral load for initiation of anti-viral treatment, according to pre-emptive therapy strategies.33 Molecular amplification assays have superseded viral culture for the diagnosis of HSV and VZV infections.",
