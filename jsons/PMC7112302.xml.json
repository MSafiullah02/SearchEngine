            "text": "Coronaviruses have made a remarkable career. Originally recognized as viral pathogens of veterinary importance but little medical (i.e., human) relevance, the appearance of SARS-CoV causing a worldwide epidemic with a large number of fatalities has changed everything. In 2003, the virus emerged in Chinese animal markets to circle the world in just a few weeks, teaching us important new lessons on perceived \u201cdifferences\u201d between animal and human pathogens. Just in case someone did not get the message, MERS-CoV repeated the coronavirus wake-up call 10 years later, providing yet another example for how easily animal viruses may be transmitted and adapt to new hosts including humans. Often, the tricks and strategies that viruses evolved to propagate in specific animal hosts may only need some fine-tuning (if at all) to enter the wide world of human crowds, air travel, and camel races. Here, we will summarize the insights gathered so far on an important aspect of virulence and host adaptation, the interactions of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with antiviral interferon (IFN) responses of human cells.",

            "text": "The coronavirus genome is composed of a linear, single-stranded, monopartite RNA with a cap structure at its 5\u2032 end and a polyA tail at the 3\u2032 end (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). The 5\u2032-terminal two-thirds of the CoV genome contain the open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b that together constitute the viral replicase gene. Translation is initiated at the start codon of ORF1a and may continue to ORF1b via a ribosomal frameshift mechanism, ultimately giving rise to two overlapping replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (Fehr and Perlman, 2015, Perlman and Netland, 2009, Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). Virus-encoded proteinases, namely two papain-like cysteine proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro), residing in nonstructural protein (nsp) 3 and a 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) associated with nsp5, proteolytically process the polyproteins into nsps 1\u201316 (Anand et al., 2003, Schiller et al., 1998, Thiel et al., 2003, Ziebuhr et al., 2007). A multitude of functions and enzymatic activities associated with specific nsps have been identified over the past years (for reviews, see Masters and Perlman, 2013, Ziebuhr, 2005). Moreover, ORF1b harbors several RNA-processing enzymes, including a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease and a guanosine N7-methyltransferase (associated with the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, of nsp14), an endoribonuclease (nsp15) and a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (nsp16) (Chen et al., 2009, Decroly et al., 2008, Fehr and Perlman, 2015, Ivanov et al., 2004, Kindler and Thiel, 2014, Minskaia et al., 2006, Perlman and Netland, 2009, Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003, Zust et al., 2011). The 3\u2032 ORFs are translated from a set of subgenomic (sg) RNAs and yield on one hand four canonical structural proteins like the spike protein (S), the envelope (E), the membrane (M), and the nucleoprotein (N). Moreover, sgRNAs express accessory genes, which vary in function and number between different CoV strains and are interspersed between the structural genes (Fehr and Perlman, 2015, Perlman and Netland, 2009, Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). Specifically, the genome of SARS-CoV expresses eight different accessory genes (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b), while MERS-CoV encodes five accessory genes (3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b). The schematic overview of the genome organization of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is depicted in Fig. 1\n.",

            "text": "The CoV life cycle starts with the attachment of the viral spike protein to particular cellular receptors, subsequently leading to fusion between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane or the endosome membrane of the host. CoV uses a range of receptors, with SARS-CoV employing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and MERS-CoV employing dipeptyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Li et al., 2003, Raj et al., 2013). Following membrane fusion, the viral RNA genome is delivered into the host cytoplasm, where translation of the two 5\u2032-terminal ORFs 1a and 1b is accomplished by the cellular translation machinery. Most of the newly synthesized nsps assemble with the N protein into a replicase\u2013transcriptase complex (RTC) responsible for viral genome replication and transcription. At the site of replicative organelles (Knoops et al., 2008), the RTC initiates minus-strand synthesis using the full-length genome as template, thereby either copying the entire template to generate full-length minus strands or to move discontinuously along the template to produce a nested set of sgRNAs with negative polarity. The minus strands of genomic and sgRNAs are subsequently used as templates to synthesize positive sense strands (mRNAs), specifically the genomic RNA (genome replication) and sg mRNAs (transcription) (Sawicki et al., 2007). The N protein then encapsidates the newly synthetized RNA genome and thereby forms a helical nucleocapsid. Virion assembly is triggered by the action of the M protein, which assists in incorporating the nucleocapsid, the envelope and the spike into virus particles. Budding takes place between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi and new viruses are released by exocytosis (McBride et al., 2014, Neuman et al., 2011, Ruch and Machamer, 2012, Ujike and Taguchi, 2015).",

All nucleated cells are able to respond to them as they express the IFN receptor (composed of the two subunits IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2) on their surface (Bekisz et al., 2004). The docking of IFN-alpha/beta onto its cognate receptor activates the so-called JAK\u2013STAT pathway. Thereby, the Janus kinases JAK1 and TYK2 are waiting to be activated on the cytoplasmic side of IFNAR2 and 1, respectively. The activated kinases then phosphorylate the signal transducers and transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2, which form a complex with IRF9 (ISGF3) that enters the nucleus to transactivate promoters of an antiviral gene expression program. Genes that are specifically upregulated by IFNs are collectively called ISGs (IFN-stimulated genes).",

They employ however a different receptor which is only expressed by epithelial cells (Sommereyns et al., 2008).

            "text": "The molecular events leading to the upregulation of type I IFNs are well established. As indicated earlier, molecular structures that are specific for virus infections (often called PAMPs, for pathogen-associated molecular patterns) are sensed by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) of the host, that in turn are triggering the upregulation of IFN genes. A prototypical PAMP relevant for coronaviruses is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a by-product of genome replication and transcription (Weber et al., 2006, Zielecki et al., 2013). dsRNA can be sensed by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in the endosome, and in the cytoplasm by the RNA helicases RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation antigen 5), as well as by the kinase PKR (protein kinase, RNA-activated) (Rasmussen et al., 2009, Yim and Williams, 2014, Yoneyama et al., 2016). RIG-I is thereby specific for long dsRNA molecules and short dsRNAs bearing a tri- or di-phosphorylated 5\u2032 end, whereas MDA5 senses long dsRNAs, preferentially with a higher-order structure (Binder et al., 2011, Goubau et al., 2014, Pichlmair et al., 2009, Schlee, 2013). PKR is activated by dsRNA as well as by short stem-loop RNAs bearing a 5\u2032 triphosphate end (Dabo and Meurs, 2012, Nallagatla et al., 2011). Also specific single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) can act as PAMPs, either if they are in the wrong location or if they display particular features. TLR7 senses GU-rich ssRNA in the endosome (Heil et al., 2004). RIG-I can be triggered by polyU/UC rich or 3\u2032 monophosphorylated ssRNAs stretches, and MDA5 was found to bind ssRNA stretches of negative-sense RNA viruses and hypomethylated 5\u2032 capped mRNAs (Luthra et al., 2011, Malathi et al., 2007, Malathi et al., 2010, Rasmussen et al., 2009, Runge et al., 2014, Saito et al., 2008, Zust et al., 2011).",

The kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon then phosphorylate IRF3 (IFN regulatory factor 3), a transcription factor that activates genes for IFNs and other immunoregulatory cytokines. Signaling by TLR7, by contrast, requires the adaptor proteins MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88) and TRAF3 to channel to the kinase IKKalpha. This kinase then phosphorylates IRF7, a transcription factor that covers a gene spectrum similar to IRF3. TLR7/MyD88 also recruits the adaptor protein TRAF6 that eventually activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB via the kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta. NF-kappaB drives transcription of genes for proinflammatory cytokines but also enhances IFN gene expression.",

ISGF3 binds to the ISREs (for IFN-stimulated response element), specific promoter sequences of the so-called ISGs. Of note, there are actually several types of \u201cISREs\u201d that are responding to different types of triggers and transcription factors. First, there are the ISREs that purely respond to IFN signaling and ISGF3, as it would be expected from the name. A prominent example is given by the promoter of the human antiviral protein MxA (Holzinger et al., 2007). Second, there are the\u2014somewhat mislabeled\u2014ISREs that do not respond to IFN at all, but only to the IRF3-, IRF7-, and NF-kappaB-related signal transduction that occurs much earlier, directly after virus infection has triggered a PRR. The IFN-beta promoter belongs to this class of ISREs (Freaney et al., 2013, Schmid et al., 2010). Third, there are mixed-type ISREs that can be activated by both virus infection and IFNs. An example is the promoter of the gene for the antiviral protein IFIT1 (also known as ISG56) (Fensterl and Sen, 2015). The different ISRE classes can be distinguished as IRF-specific ISREs (responding only to PRR signaling), ISGF3-specific ISREs (responding only to type I or type III IFNs), and universal ISREs (responding to both infection and IFNs) (Schmid et al., 2010). Many ISGs are controlled by additional promoter elements ensuring basal levels of expression already in the absence of IFN. Moreover, low levels of IFN itself are constitutively secreted by many tissues (tonic IFN), ensuring physiological homeostasis and priming of cells for a rapid response against pathogens (Gough et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The cellular basis for the relatively low (SARS-CoV) and high (MERS-CoV) IFN sensitivity is currently unknown. Several prominent (i.e., potent) ISG products were studied in the context of human pathogenic coronaviruses, but only some of them were found to have an effect. The IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITMs) proteins 1, 2, and 3 restrict the entry of many enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV (Huang et al., 2011b) as well as reoviruses (Bailey et al., 2014). They act by altering the site of membrane fusion, but the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated (Bailey et al., 2014). Strikingly, while IFITMs are inhibitory for the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV, they appear to boost infection with the related, low pathogenic coronavirus HCoV-OC43 (Zhao et al., 2014). In particular, IFITM2 or IFITM3 acts as entry factor for HCoV-OC43 by facilitating\u2014rather than impeding\u2014membrane fusion. Human MxA (for Myxovirus resistance protein A) is a well-known antiviral host factor with activity against a wide range of (mostly) RNA viruses (Haller et al., 2015). It blocks early replication steps of influenza viruses but was found have no effect on SARS-CoV (Spiegel et al., 2004). The kinase PKR is an ISG product acting as a signaling PRR on one hand (see earlier), but its main function in antiviral defense is the inhibition of protein synthesis. After binding viral dsRNA, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation to activate itself, and subsequently phosphorylates eIF-2alpha that is thereby converted from a translation initiation factor to a translation inhibitor (Yim and Williams, 2014). PKR has a broad antiviral spectrum. Nonetheless, PKR has no bearing on the replication of SARS-CoV, although it is involved in virally induced apoptosis (Krahling et al., 2009). Also the 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family members are triggered by viral dsRNA (Chakrabarti et al., 2011). In the dsRNA-bound state they synthesize short chains of 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylates that activate the latent RNase L. RNase L then cleaves virus and host ssRNAs, predominantly at single-stranded UA and UU dinucleotides (Wreschner et al., 1981). Interestingly, the small 3\u2032-monophosphorylated cleavage products of RNase L are recognized by the PRRs RIG-I and MDA5, thus amplifying the IFN response in an infection-dependent manner (Malathi et al., 2007). Polymorphisms of the OAS-1 gene might affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV (Hamano et al., 2005), but to our knowledge, there is no direct data on antiviral effects of the OAS/RNase L system on human coronaviruses. For the mouse coronavirus MHV-A59, however, it was shown that mutants deficient in the ns2 gene are highly sensitive against RNase L (Zhao et al., 2012) (see also later).",

Most likely, active and passive evasion mechanisms such as the ones described later are responsible for the relative insensitivity of at least SARS-CoV against IFN and potent antiviral ISGs. Although our review will focus on the human pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we will draw additional conclusions from well investigated other coronaviruses whenever adequate.",

In fact, it was recently shown in a mouse model of SARS that the delay in IFN induction is responsible for the activation of proinflammatory monocyte-macrophages and cytokines in the lung, resulting in vascular leakage and impaired adaptive immune responses (Channappanavar et al., 2016). Thus, the high levels of dsRNA that are produced during replication (Weber et al., 2006, Zielecki et al., 2013) do not result in an adequate IFN induction. One of the reasons (besides the active measures described later) is certainly the storage of coronaviral dsRNA inside double-membrane vesicles (Knoops et al., 2008, van Hemert et al., 2008, Versteeg et al., 2007). Moreover, the N protein sequesters IFN-inducing RNA PAMPs (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Lu et al., 2011). However, the fact that infection with coronaviruses activates the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing host factors PKR and OAS (Birdwell et al., 2016, Krahling et al., 2009, Zhao et al., 2012), as well as the existence of numerous mechanisms dedicated to suppress dsRNA-dependent IFN induction (see later) strongly suggest that dsRNA stashing alone is not sufficient and that some dsRNA or other PAMPs are exposed to PRRs, thus necessitating the presence of additional, active mechanisms.",

For the mouse coronavirus MHV-A59 it was shown that IFN induction in pDCs occurs through TLR7 (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007), suggesting the same to be true for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Indeed, GU-rich ssRNAs from the SARS-CoV genome were shown to activate an excessive innate immune response via TLR7 (Li et al., 2013). Moreover, the membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV are able to activate a TLR-like pathway and NF-kappaB signaling, respectively (DeDiego et al., 2014, Wang and Liu, 2016).",

            "text": "Besides these \u201chiding\u201d or \u201cdisguising\u201d strategies, active mechanisms targeting specific host factors are in place (Table 1\n). SARS-CoV was shown to inhibit IRF3 by preventing its hyperphosphorylation, dimerization, and interaction with the cofactor CBP (Spiegel et al., 2005). Curiously, IRF3 initially enters the nucleus of infected cells, but later returns to the cytoplasm. SARS-CoV also inhibits the nuclear import of the related transcription factor IRF7 (Kuri et al., 2009). In this context, the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain of nsp3 (the largest coronaviral protein) of SARS-CoV and the mildly pathogenic HCoV-NL63 both interact with IRF3 and block its activation (Devaraj et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2009). Moreover, PLpro was shown to drive the deubiquitination (or inhibit ubiquitination) of RIG-I, TBK1, and IRF3 (Clementz et al., 2010, Devaraj et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2012). IRF3 activation is also prevented by the M protein of SARS-CoV through inhibiting complex formation between TRAF3 and TBK1 (Siu et al., 2009). Since M was also found to activate a TLR-like signaling pathway (Wang and Liu, 2016), a final picture of M protein function in the context of IFN induction/inhibition remains to be provided. IFN induction is also disturbed by the SARS-CoV nsp1, nsp7, nsp15, ORF3b, ORF6, and ORF9b proteins, respectively (Frieman et al., 2009, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Shi et al., 2014, Zust et al., 2007). The anti-IFN function of nsp1 is based on its ability to mediate host mRNA degradation, while sparing viral mRNAs at the same time, and to block host mRNA translation (Huang et al., 2011a, Narayanan et al., 2008, Tanaka et al., 2012). Nsp1 also has a function in evasion from IFN signaling (see later), providing a possible reason why nsp1 mutants are particularly IFN sensitive (Wathelet et al., 2007, Zust et al., 2007). While the mechanisms of other SARS-CoV IFN induction antagonists like nsp7, nsp15, ORF3b, and ORF6 proteins remain to be characterized, for the ORF9b protein it was shown that it drives degradation of MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF6 by interacting with the host factors PCBP2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 (Shi et al., 2014).",

The ORF4a protein inhibits IFN induction by interaction with dsRNA and the RLR cofactor PACT (Niemeyer et al., 2013, Siu et al., 2014). Like the ORF4a, the ORF4b, 5, and M proteins of MERS-CoV were shown to prevent IRF3 translocation (Yang et al., 2013). The ORF4b protein, in particular, inhibits IFN induction by binding to TBK1 and IKKepsilon (Matthews et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2015). In agreement with the data on SARS-CoV, the PLpro of MERS-CoV has deubiquitinating activity and inhibits IFN induction (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014, Mielech et al., 2014), and the nsp1 mediates host mRNA degradation (Lokugamage et al., 2015). In contrast to SARS-CoV, however, infection with MERS-CoV additionally activates repressive histone modifications that downregulate ISG expression (Menachery et al., 2014a).",

            "text": "Several proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were found to interfere with the signal transduction chain that leads from IFN docking onto its receptor to the upregulation of ISGs by ISGF3, the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 complex (Table 2\n). The ORF3a protein was shown to decrease levels of IFNAR, most probably by ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation (Minakshi et al., 2009). The ORF6 protein was the first factor described for SARS-CoV that affects IFN signaling in infected cells, disrupting nuclear import of STAT1 (Frieman et al., 2007, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). The ORF6 protein binds to the nuclear import factor karyopherin alpha 2 and tethers it (together with karyopherin beta 1) to intracellular membranes (Frieman et al., 2007). There, they become unavailable for their normal cellular function, the import of, e.g., STAT1. The phosphorylation of STAT1 is impeded by the multifunctional nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV, which otherwise drives degradation of host mRNAs and inhibits translation (see earlier) (Wathelet et al., 2007). For MERS-CoV, the ORF4a, 4b, and M proteins inhibit ISRE activation after stimulation with IFN (Yang et al., 2013). The mechanisms are currently unknown. The ORF4a protein, which also acts as an inhibitor of IFN induction (see earlier), had the strongest activity. Lastly, the repressive modifications that are imposed by MERS-CoV onto the cellular histones are also a strategy to dampen ISG expression (Menachery et al., 2014a).",

            "text": "Despite having some sensitivity toward IFN, especially MERS-CoV (see Section 4), viral strategies to increase IFN resistance are also in place (Table 3\n). The sequestration of viral dsRNA in DMVs (Knoops et al., 2008, van Hemert et al., 2008, Versteeg et al., 2007) not only reduces cytoplasmic exposure to PRRs and hence IFN induction but also limits activation of antiviral dsRNA-responsive ISG products like PKR. However, PKR is eventually activated by SARS-CoV infection, but has no effect on viral replication (Krahling et al., 2009). Interestingly, other coronaviruses cope differently with PKR. The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) expresses a weak inhibitor or PKR (nsp2) and additionally upregulates the phosphatase subunit GADD34 to reduce phosphorylation of the PKR downstream target eIF-2alpha (Wang et al., 2009). By contrast, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV; a member of the Arteriviridae that are related to the Coronaviridae and other nidoviruses) does not inhibit but rather requires PKR for optimal replication and gene expression (Wang et al., 2016). Thus, the interactions and interdependencies of coronaviruses with PKR are complex and far from being understood. With respect to the antiviral OAS/RNase L system that is also activated by dsRNA, the mouse coronavirus MHV-A59 was shown to expresses an ns2 protein that antagonizes by degrading the product of the OAS enzyme, 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate that would activate RNase L (Zhao et al., 2012). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not possess an ns2 homolog (Silverman and Weiss, 2014), but the MERS-CoV ns4b was recently demonstrated to cleave 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate (Thornbrough et al., 2016). Although ns4b-mutated MERS-CoV was not attenuated in cell culture, it provoked increased RNAse L activity in infected cells (Thornbrough et al., 2016). A critical factor for IFN resistance of SARS-CoV (and of the low pathogenic HCoV-229E) is the ADP-ribose-1\u2033-monophosphatase (ADRP) domain that is contained within the nsp3 protein (Kuri et al., 2011). Virus mutants lacking a functional ADRP domain (also called macrodomain) display an increased IFN sensitivity. ADRP-like macrodomains are encoded by other coronaviruses and several other positive-strand RNA viruses (Gorbalenya et al., 1991). Also for MHV-A59, a role of the ADRP domain in pathogenesis was shown (Eriksson et al., 2008, Fehr et al., 2015), but this seems not be related to IFN sensitivity.",

For SARS-CoV, the catalogue of IFN antagonists may be nearly complete by now and that of MERS-CoV may follow soon. Nonetheless, we are still far from comprehensively understanding the manifold interactions of human pathogenic coronaviruses with the IFN system. Many of the factors described here were identified by overexpression studies, and still lack the final biological assessment through generation and characterization of adequate virus mutants. It would also be interesting to see at which infections stage, in which subcellular compartment, and with which comparative intensity the IFN antagonists act, and whether and how they interact with each other. It is however safe to state that coronaviruses, which have the largest RNA genome known to date, do not rely on single virulence factors but employ several layers of anti-IFN strategies. Otherwise they would not be able to exist, thrive, and even expand to new hosts in the presence of powerful antiviral IFN responses.",
