For long, mathematical modeling has served as a simple and yet efficient tool to investigate, predict, and control spread of communicable diseases through individuals. A myriad of works on epidemic models and their variants have been reported in the literature. For better prediction of the dynamics of a particular disease, it is important to adopt the most suitable model. In this paper, we study some of the widelyappreciated deterministic epidemic models in which the population is divided into compartments based on the health status of each individual. In particular, we provide a demographic classification of such models and study each of them in terms of mathematical formulation, near equilibrium point stability properties, and disease outbreak threshold conditions (basic reproduction ratio). Furthermore, we discuss the various influential factors that need to be considered during epidemic modeling. The main objective of this article is to provide a basic understanding of the mathematical complexity incurred in deterministic epidemic models with the aid of graphical illustrations obtained through implementation.",

Several lives have been lost due to lack of knowledge on the dynamical behavior of epidemic outbreaks of contagious diseases and measures to confront them [1] , [2] . For decades, scientists have toiled to understand the transmission characteristics of such diseases so as to devise control strategies to prevent further spread of infection. The field of science that studies such epidemic diseases and in particular, the factors that influence the incidence, distribution, and control of infectious diseases in human populations is called epidemiology. In this regard, mathematical modeling has proven to serve useful in analyzing, predicting, evaluating, detecting, and implementing efficient control programs. Such analytical models accompanied by computer simulations serve as experimental tools for building, testing, and assessing theories and understanding the relationship between various parametric values involved. Practical use of epidemic models depends on how closely they realize actual biological diseases in real world. To keep the models simple and tractable, many assumptions and relaxations are taken into consideration at each level of the process. However, even such simplified models often pose significant questions regarding the underlying mechanisms of infection spread and possible control approaches. Hence, adopting the apt epidemic model for prediction of real phenomenon is of great importance.",

            "text": "Models that are useful in the study of infectious diseases at the population scale can be broadly classified into two types: deterministic and stochastic. Early models that were developed to study specific diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, and rubella were deterministic in nature. In deterministic models, the large population is divided into smaller groups called compartments (or classes) where each group represents a specific stage of the epidemic. Such models, often formulated in terms of a system of differential equations (in continuous time) or difference equations (in discrete time), attempt to explain what happens on the average at the population scale. A solution of a deterministic model is a function of time or space and is generally uniquely dependent on the initial data. On the other hand, a stochastic model is formulated in terms of a stochastic process which, in turn, is a set of random variables, X(t; \u03c9) \u2261 X(t), defined as {X(t; \u03c9)|t \u2208 T and \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126} where T and \u2126 represent time and a common sample space, respectively. The solution of a stochastic model is a probability distribution for each of the random variables. Such models capture the variability inherent due to demographic and environment variability and are useful under small population sizes. More specifically, they allow follow-up of each individual in the population on a chance basis [3] , [4] . Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), and stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are three types of stochastic modeling processes which have been deeply covered in [5] . Figure 1 shows the different classes under which epidemic models have been studied in the literature. The connecting blue lines in the figure highlight the main scope of this report.",

            "text": "Needless to say, both deterministic and stochastic epidemic models have their own applications. Deterministic models are used to address questions such as: what fraction of individuals would be infected in an epidemic outbreak?, what conditions should be satisfied to prevent and control an epidemic?, what happens if individuals are mixed non-homogeneously?, and so on [6] . While such models are preferable in studying a large population, stochastic epidemic models are useful for a small community and answer questions such as: how long is the disease likely to persist?, what is the probability of a major outbreak?, and the like [5] . Hence, stochastic epidemic models are generalized forms of simple deterministic counterparts. However, unlike deterministic models, stochastic mod- Figure 1 : Classification of various classes of epidemic models. els can be laborious to set up and may need many simulation runs to yield useful predictions. They can become mathematically very complex and result in misperception of the dynamics [3] . To this end, we focus on some widely-used deterministic models which are relatively easier to conceive, set up, and implement using various computer softwares at disposal. Deterministic epidemiology is believed to have started in the early twentieth century [7] . In 1906, Hamer was the first to assume that the incidence (number of new cases per unit time) is proportional to the product of the number of susceptible and infective individuals in his model for measles epidemics [8] . The exponential growth in mathematical epidemiology was boosted by the acclaimed work of Kermack and McKendrick which was published in 1927 [9] . This paper laid out a foundation for modeling infections where all members of the population are assumed to be initially equally susceptible to the disease and confer complete immunity only after recovery. After decades of neglect, the Kermack-McKendrick model was brought back to prominence by Anderson et al. in 1979 [10] . Since then several models have been developed addressing aspects such as passive and disease-acquired immunity, vaccination, quarantine, vertical transmission, disease vectors, age structure, social and sexual mixing groups, as well as chemotherapy [11, 12, 13, 14] . Improved models have also been designed for diseases such as measles, chickenpox, smallpox, whooping cough, malaria, rabies, diphtheria, filariasis, herpes, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS [14] , [15] .",

Based upon this assumption, the standard disease incidence rate is defined as \u03b2S I/N and the overall rate of recovery is given as \u03b3I. In spite of the above simplifying assumptions, the resulting non-linear system does not admit a closed-form solution. Nevertheless, we shall see how significant results can be derived analytically.

However, recent studies include differentiation of susceptibility to infection (DS) due to genetic variation of susceptible individuals, variation in infectiousness, and disease spread in competing populations [31] .",

In these models, we assumed that the infected and susceptible individuals mix homogeneously. An increasingly important issue in epidemiology is how to extend these classical formulations to adequately describe the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of susceptible and infected people and in the parameters of the spread of the infection observed in both, experimental data and computer simulations. Diffusion or migration of individuals in space are simply of two types: migration among different patches and continuous diffusion in space. In the former type, migration of individuals between patches depend on the connectivity of the patches. Models with migration between two patches [44] and n patches [45] have been reported in the literature. The latter type, on the other hand, takes into account the fact that the distribution of individuals and their interactions depend not only on the time t, but also the location in a given space.",

However, Capasso et. al [46] showed that it is likely possible for a DFE and EE to be stable simultaneously. Futhermore, periodic oscillations have been observed in the incidence of various diseases including mumps, chickenpox, influenza, and the like. The question that arises is why are classical epidemic models unable to capture these periodic phenomena? The main reason is the nature of the force of infection. Classical models frequently use mass incidence and standard incidence which imply that the contact rate and infection probability per contact are constant in time.",

Aiming at filling such a gap, this work introduced some widely-appreciated epidemic models and studied each in terms of mathematical formulation, near equilibrium point stability analysis, and threshold dynamics with the aid of Mathematica. In addition, important factors that may be considered for better modeling were also presented. We believe that this article would serve as a good starting point for readers new to this research area and/or with little mathematical background.",
