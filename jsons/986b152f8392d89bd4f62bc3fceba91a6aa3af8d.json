We extend a standard epidemiological SEIR model in order to: (a) identify the role of demographics (population size and population age distribution) on COVID-19 fatality rates; (b) quantify the maximum number of 15 lives that can be saved according to different testing strategies, different levels of herd immunity, and specific population characteristics; and (d) infer from the observed case fatality rates (CFR) what the true fatality rate might be. Different from previous SEIR model extensions, we implement a Bayesian Melding method in our calibration strategy which enables us to account for data limitation on the total number of deaths.

However, information on deaths still present less uncertainty than data on infections (15), and that is why we calibrate the epidemiological model using the evolution of the number of deaths, and account for overreporting by including all causes of death that are not COVID-19 (See Fig S2) . In addition, 15 COVID-19 deaths by age show a sizable age gradient (15, 16), which is quite similar to the age gradient observed in standard mortality rates, making it important to acknowledge that the fatality rate from COVID-19 increases with age. To account for the age difference, we fitted through an OLS the log of the age-specific mortality rates for the coronavirus using a quadratic function by age (see Fig. S2 in the supplementary material). As the number of infected cases by age are likely 20 underreported (17), actual mortality rates by age from COVID-19 are probably lower. Therefore, in order to control for the unknown number of infected people who were not developing symptoms (i.e. asymptomatic) and were not tested against the virus, we have introduced in the calibration process an adjustment factor (details on the model and the calibration are in the section 1 of the supp. material). 25",

While for SARS-CoV-1 the peak viral shedding occurred 5 after patients were very ill with respiratory symptoms that could easily be traced, identified and isolated (1), viral shedding for COVID-19 is long and observed in asymptomatic individuals (3) making it difficult to control human-to-human transmission, with many countries only realizing the spread of the disease when they were already seriously hit (4) . With the rapid undetected spread and lack of fast response or testing availability, most countries, with few exceptions 1 , relied heavily 10 on widespread social distance measures and lockdowns, while restricting testing to symptomatic individuals. These measures are effective to control the infection, but have important socioeconomic, psychological and health consequences, and unless herd immunity considerably develops, most likely a second wave (or waves) of infection will arise as people slowly return to their activities (5) . In addition, due to the major role of infectious asymptomatic individuals, 15 restricting testing to the symptomatic makes it difficult to estimate the true case fatality rates and appropriately measure the death toll, since the less tests you make, the lower the number of detected persons and the higher the case fatality rates (6) .",

We account in a combined fashion for those last three factors by extending a standard epidemiological (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) compartment model by (a) accounting for the age structure of the population and age-specific mortality rates, (b) explicitly modeling the mortality rate of the COVID-19 25 epidemics and (c) introducing isolation periods during incubation (E) and the infectious period (I) after testing (see Fig. S1 for a schematic diagram of the SEIR model implemented).

In addition, the recovery period is on average 11 days (IQR [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , the time the virus affects individuals is 14.5 days , and the transmission rate 0.432 (IQR 0.325-0.489). Fig. S3 shows the posterior distribution of the basic reproduction number \u211b 0 . Our results show that the most probable \u211b 0 values range between 2.6-5 5.1, with a mean value of 4.51, very close to the basic reproduction number estimated for Wuhan (20) (for a detailed description of the calibration procedures and the epidemic parameters of the model see section 1. 2 and Table S1 in the supp. material). In addition, our calibration shows that 56% of the infected individuals are on average asymptomatic, with the distribution of the infected individuals according to their symptoms shown in Table 1 As the role of the asymptomatic individuals is particularly important for the spread of COVID-19, taking into account that on average 56% of infected individuals are asymptomatic gives a picture of the potential for infection spread. By multiplying the modeled fatality rate by the fraction of symptomatic people among all infectious people, the distribution of the true fatality rate is derived 20 5 ",

Because we are particularly concerned with the aftermath of the virus, we present all results for day 365, i.e., after one year of outbreak for each country (the daily 5 distribution is available upon request). We first estimate the impact of COVID-19 death toll in the absence of a lockdown policy and no available vaccine, assuming a well-mixed population. For comparability reasons, we apply in all countries the same initial number of imported and infected individuals, which follows a temporal Poisson process Pois(\u03bbt), with \u03bb = 10. This implies that countries receive a monthly average of 300 infected individuals. The age of imported cases is 10 assumed to be a random number drawn from a uniform distribution with a minimum age of 18 and a maximum of 65 which corresponds to the age of potential workers (average age of the infected individuals is 41.5 years old, which does not necessarily coincide with the average age of the population analyzed). people infected depends on country size and the fatality rate depends on the age distribution of the population. Fig. 1 shows in panel A an example with extreme cases on how the transmission rate is faster in countries with a small population size like Iceland (over 340 thousand inhabitants) compared to larger countries like Brazil (over 210 million inhabitants) and China (over 1400 million inhabitants). This implies that in a context of no lockdown policy, no available vaccine, 20 and assuming a well-mixed population, small populations get infected faster than large populations. As a consequence, the peak of the mortality rate will be sooner in small populations relative to larger ones (see Table S2 for the average death toll of COVID-19 after one year in the world). Panel B shows the positive relationship between the average fatality rate and the mean age of the population for 200 countries in the world. Younger populations (mean age < 30 years) face 25 a fatality rate of around 0.2%, whereas older populations (mean age > 40 years) face a fatality rate close to 0.9%. When comparing to the grey dots that represent deaths unrelated to COVID-19, it is clear that COVID-19 is not the main cause of death in younger populations, but has the potential to double the number of deaths in ageing populations, if no policies are implemented (see Table   S2 ).

Herd immunity and serological survey can increase the amount of lives 9 saved both through decreasing the transmission rate and increasing the number of recovered, since people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies in their plasma that can attack the virus and be used for treatment of severe patients (23, 24). Panel A in Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the average COVID-19 fatality rate and the mean age of the population for five different levels of testing and three possible degrees of herd immunity. It may come as a 5 surprise that the fatality rate does not change much across different levels of herd immunity, but this is due to the fact that both the number of deaths and the number of infected individuals decrease, affecting the numerator and the denominator that compose the fatality rate. However, the herd immunity level does change the percentage of lives saved relative to the population size. Fig. 3 panel B shows that, for a given level of testing, the higher is the herd immunity level in a 10 population, the greater is the percentage of lives saved (relative to the initial susceptible population). Moreover, this effect is more intense in large populations and for greater levels of testing. The fact that the fatality rate is rather insensitive to different levels of herd immunity reinforces the importance of looking not only into the fatality rates as a way to assess the impact on lives lost, but also considering the proportion of lives saved. .

Rates in Brazil and Niger suggest that less than 9% of the total infected individuals are tested. Thus, in these two countries the total number of infected people is more than ten times higher than those being reported. In the US, the CFR value suggests that around 15% of the infected individuals are tested and therefore the likely total number of infected people is more than six times higher than those reported. In 20 Austria, which is a country that started testing at high proportions, the CFR value suggests that around than 25% of the infected individuals are tested. As a result, the total number of infected individuals is at least more than four times the total infected individuals tested, which coincides with the lower bound estimated by a recent study (25). We extend the analysis to the whole world, with results detailed in the supplementary materials (see Fig. S12 and Table S7 ). Overall, only 25 testing the critical and severe cases implies that CFRs are above 10% in countries with a mean age of the population above 42 years and close to 2% in countries with a mean age of the population below 25 years. Once the level of testing reaches all symptomatic individuals (i.e. 44% of all infected), we observe CFR values that are lower than 2.5% in all countries. This implies that CFRs can be reduced by half by testing at least 72% of the total infected population (relative to the 30 symptomatic individuals). Additionally, intervention day, population size, and herd immunity are 13 factors that influence the total number of people infected, as shown in Table S4 and Figs. 4 and S10. However, conditional on being infected, the probability of dying from the epidemic (fatality rate) just depends on age. Thus, given the demographic characteristic of each population -e.g. the mean age of the population-we can infer through the case fatality rate the total number of people infected in each country, which is a feature that may help us shed light on the number of 5 people infected.",

CFRs can be reduced by half by testing at least 72% of the total infected population and the number of infected in some countries is at 15 least ten times higher than those being reported. Countries that test only severe and critical COVID-19 cases have CFRs above 10% in countries with a mean age of the population above 42 years and close to 2% in countries with a mean age of the population below 25 years, so younger countries experience lower impacts in terms of fatality rates relative to older ones. Smaller countries are more vulnerable to a faster spread of the virus and herd immunity is important, but 20 affects more the proportion of lives being saved than the fatality rates.

Under-reporting is occurring because there is no common agreement across countries on how COVID-19 deaths should be counted. Indeed, many countries are only counting as COVID-19 deaths those individuals who were tested positive, despite the fact that many people who died with COVID-19 symptoms were not tested.

There are some key features of the mortality pattern shown by COVID-19. First, early statistics on death by COVID-19 have shown a sizable age gradient (3), which is quite similar to the age gradient observed at old age in standard mortality rates. For this reason, it is important to consider in the model that the fatality rate of COVID-19 is increasing with age. To account for the age pattern, we regressed through an OLS the 2 .

Our analysis and calibration were performed with the use of Julia 1.3 (Julia Lab) and R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). We calibrate the model to the evolution of the total number of deaths in the province of Hubei (China). We run our model assuming that the first COVID-19 case appeared at November 17th, 2019 (t = 1), the first death occurred on January 11th, 2020 (s = 1 and t = 56), and the epidemic curve started to flatten on February 12, 2020 (T = 33 and t = 88). The maximum discrepancy e max is set at 150 deaths in order to allow for sufficient output variability. Moreover, we set the pooling weight, \u03b1, at 0.5 in order to give a similar importance to the model and the data. Since the age distribution of the population in Hubei (China) resembles that of China, we scaled down the Chinese population to the total population size of Hubei. However, we keep the death tolls reported from official statistics, since the majority of the cases belong to Hubei. Next, we detail the steps of the Bayesian Melding algorithm: 5 Our model M (\u0398) might not be invertible because the parameters \u03b2 and \u03c3 are highly correlated. 6 The error distribution of es is the result of assuming that the difference between the model's deaths and the observed deaths at any time t is i.i.d. according to a N (0, 1).",

We sample 500 quadruplets from the discrete distribution (\u03b8 i , w(\u03b8 i )) Table S1 summarizes the marginal posterior distributions of the model parameters (\u0398). 7 Parameters \u03c3 \u22121 and \u03bd \u22121 measure the average durations that a representative individual spends in states E and I, respectively. 8 Parameter \u03b2 measures the transmission rate and 1 \u2212 \u03b5 accounts for the proportion of asymptomatic individuals among the infected. We obtain that the mean incubation period is slightly higher than the median incubation of 3.0 days reported for pediatric patients (2) and one day shorter than the average incubation period of 5.2 days reported for patients older than 50 years by (7) . Our calibration gives that the recovery period ranges between 6 and 15 days, with an average period of 11 days. By adding the incubation and recovery periods we obtain that the time the virus affects individuals ranges between 7.7 (1st Qu.) and 19 days (3rd Qu.), with an average time of 14.5 days. The transmission rate takes values between 0.325 and 0.489, where the average is 0.432. Figure S3 shows the posterior distribution of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ). This plot shows how frequent an R 0 value is obtained across the 500 combinations of the parameters drawn from the discrete distribution (\u03b8, w(\u03b8)). Our results give that the most probable R 0 values range between 2.6 (1st Qu.) and 5.1 (3rd. Qu.). The mean value of R 0 , which is represented by a vertical red line in Fig. S3 , is 4.51. Thus, the mean R 0 is very close to the basic reproduction number estimated for Wuhan (9) , while the most frequently obtained value is between 2.5 and 3.0. The last row in Table S1 reports the 1st and 3rd quartiles and the median and mean values for the fraction of asymptomatic individuals, 1 \u2212 \u03b5. Our calibration suggests that 56 percent of the infected individuals are on average asymptomatic and with 50% probability the fraction of asymptomatic individuals range between 44.65% and 68.31%. Moreover, following (10) and assuming that among the symptomatic individuals roughly 80% are mild, 15% are severe, and 5% are critical, our model suggests that the distribution of the infected individuals according to their symptoms is: Multiplying the modeled fatality rate m c by the fraction of symptomatic people (\u03b5), the distribution of the true fatality rate is derived. Figure S4 shows the inferred COVID-19 fatality rate after the calibration process. We obtain that the average fatality rate exceeds 1% at age 60, 5% at age 80, and 10% at age 90, which is sixty percent lower than the fatality rates reported by (18).",

For comparability reasons, we apply in all countries the same initial number of imported cases and, hence, we use the onset of the outbreak to adjust the epidemic curve to each country. Thus, by assuming similar initial characteristics for all countries, this strategy will allow us to understand, in future work, whether the rapid spread of the virus was due to the number of undetected and infected cases or to the number of days since the first undetected and infected case appeared in the country. Let us consider that the number of imported and infected individuals follows a temporal Poisson process, Pois(\u03bbt), with \u03bb = 10. This process, which is shown in Figure S5 , implies that each month a country receives on average 300 infected individuals and, therefore, an outbreak can occur at any time in the year. Let us also assume that the age of the infected individuals is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution with a minimum age of 18 and a maximum of 65, U(18, 65), which corresponds to the age of potential workers. This age range implies that the average age of the infected individuals is 41.5 years old, which does not necessarily coincide with the average age of the population of each country we consider. Also, these two assumptions yield that the average period to observe the first death after the first infected cases enter in the country is 18 days. Figure S6 shows that the model is capable of tracking well the evolution of the total number of deaths in eight different countries (United States of America, Italy, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Brazil), which have different demographic characteristics. At the end of the period analyzed circles deviate from the model prediction because of the implementation of lockdown measures. These countries are chosen because they had more than 300 deaths by April 3rd, 2020 -the date at which the first data was collected-and because their case fatality rate was greater than 2.5%. 9 These two assumptions imply that neither 9 The case fatality rate calculated as the ratio between the total number of deaths and the total number of 8 .

The impact of alternative intervention days is analyzed in the next subsection. Under the assumption t I = 45, we show in Figure S9 the impact of testing on the fatality rate by mean-age of the population and on lives saved by population size. Panel A in Figure S9 shows that countries with aged populations (i.e. higher mean-age) have higher average fatality rates than countries with younger populations. However, given that the fatality rate only informs about the ratio between total deaths and total infected individuals, Panel A in Fig. S9 does not represents well how many people are saved by various testing strategies. The proportion of lives saved is defined as the relative difference between the total deaths without testing and the total deaths for a specific level of testing. Panel B in Figure S9 shows the average proportion of lives saved by testing and isolating after one year. Comparing across levels of testing Figure S9 shows that by testing and isolating individuals who develop severe or critical symptoms, the death 14 .",

We define the case fatality rate (CFR) as the ratio between the total number of deaths and the total number of infected individuals that are detected. Note that information about the total number of deaths and the total number of infected and detected individuals are provided in country reports. In our case we derive the CFR dividing the (true) fatality rate by the fraction of infected individuals who are tested. Figure S11 shows the CFR that would be reached for a given level of testing, that is maintained after one year since the onset of the epidemic outbreak, in eight selected countries (Italy, Spain, Austria, USA, China, Brazil, India, and Niger). By using the CFR in day 365, the CFR value reported is the maximum that a country will reach under a specific level of testing. 12 Equivalently, each country curve, depicted in Fig. S11 , also shows the maximum level of testing for a given CFR value. The gray area represents the level of testing for the symptomatic individuals. For each country curve, the CFR values at the left-hand side of the gray area correspond to testing infected individuals who only develop critical and severe symptoms, or 20% of the symptomatic individuals. The CFR values at the right-hand side of the gray area correspond to testing 100% of the symptomatic individuals. While the true fatality rates and the CFRs only coincide when the level of testing is one hundred percent, which corresponds to the far right point in the diagram.",

Thus, according to Fig. S11 the CFR values in China, India, Italy, and Spain suggest that these countries are mainly testing individuals who develop critical and severe symptoms (see the crossed circles over each country curve). Hence, the total number of infected people is at least ten times higher than those being reported in China, India, Italy, and Spain. The CFR values in Brazil and Niger suggest that less than 9% of the total infected individuals are tested. Thereby, the total number of infected people is more than ten times higher than those being reported in these two countries. In the US, the CFR value suggests that close to 15% of the infected individuals are tested (see the crossed circle over the orange curve) and therefore it is likely that total number of infected people is more than six times higher than those being detected. In Austria, which is a country that started testing at high proportions, the CFR value suggests that around 25% of the infected individuals are tested (see the crossed circle in third curve starting from the top). As a result, the total number of infected individuals is at least more than four times the total infected individuals tested, which coincides with the lower bound estimated by (5) for Austria. q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qqq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q We extend the analysis to the whole world by showing in Figure S12 and Table S7 the average CFR across countries by mean age of the population and testing level.

This is because the day of intervention, the population size, and the herd immunity affect on the total number of people infected, as shown in Table S4 and Figs. S9 and S10. However, conditional on being infected the probability of dying from the epidemic (or fatality rate) just depends on age. Thus, given the demographic characteristic of each population -e.g. the mean age of the population-we can infer through the case fatality rate the total number of people infected in each country.",

Source: Own calculations. Note: The gray area represents the level of testing for the symptomatic individuals. Specifically, the CFRs at the lefthand side of the gray area correspond to testing only 20% of symptomatic individuals, which are the critical and severe cases and a strategy adopted by many countries, while the CFR at the right-5 hand side of the gray area correspond to testing 100% of the symptomatic individuals. The true fatality rates and the CFRs only coincide when the level of testing is one hundred percent, which corresponds to the far-right point in the figure.The reported CFR values by countries on April 21st, 2020, represented by the crossed circles in 10 the figure, were 13.3% in Italy, 10.4% in Spain, 3.2% in Austria, 5.4% in US, 5.5% in China, 6.3% in Brazil, 3.2% in India, and 3.1% in Niger. The current reported CFR values for China, India, Italy, and Spain, when compared to our estimated values and given that not all the infected individuals are yet recovered or dead, suggest that these countries are mainly testing individuals who develop critical and severe symptoms.
