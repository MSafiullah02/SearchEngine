In industrialized countries, acute respiratory infections cause enormous direct and indirect healthcare costs, in addition to being a major cause of morbidity. They can also be an important cause of mortality among children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients [Glezen et al., 2000; Barsaoui et al., 2001; Bianco et al., 2002]. The causative agents of acute respiratory infections encompass a wide variety of microorganisms. Viral causes may be responsible for more than 35% of lower respiratory tract infections [Barsaoui et al., 2001; Siritantikorn et al., 2002]. Respiratory syncytial virus, followed by parainfluenza, and influenza viruses are the most common viruses to cause lower respiratory tract infections [Shann, 1986; Puthavathana et al., 1990; Siritantikorn et al., 2002]. Indeed, respiratory syncytial virus may be responsible for more than 78% of lower respiratory tract infections among children [Barsaoui et al., 2001; Carballal et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2001; Zambon et al., 2001; Siritantikorn et al., 2002].",

Influenza viruses may also be an important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in both children and the elderly, but with a shorter duration of illness [Zambon et al., 2001]. Adenoviruses, generally, are quite notorious in causing outbreaks among military recruits [Sanchez et al., 2001] but have also been reported in children <5 years of age [Larranaga et al., 2000]. Although human rhinoviruses are the most common upper respiratory pathogens, inducing the majority of common colds worldwide, recent evidence has suggested an association between human rhinoviruses with asthma exacerbations, including severe episodes requiring hospitalization. This indicates that human rhinovirus infections can result in serious disease [Miller et al., 2007; Louie et al., 2009]. Current evidence supports the notion that human rhinoviruses infect the lower airways, inducing a local inflammatory response [Papadopoulos et al., 2000]. Such evidence suggests that the role of human rhinoviruses in other lower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and cystic fibrosis, should be re\u2010examined with more sensitive molecular techniques.",

Furthermore, the American Thoracic Society criteria were used for lower respiratory tract infections in adults [American Thoracic Society, 2001, 2005]. Patients were admitted to Mubarak Al\u2010Kabir Hospital, Kuwait. The specimens included nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal aspirate. They were collected in the hospital and processed at the Virology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University for the presence of viral nucleic acid using PCR techniques. The study population included 542 male and 472 female patients. Of the 1,014 patients with lower respiratory tract infections, 155 (53.8%) presented with bronchiolitis, 100 (34.7%) with pneumonia, and 33 (11.5%) with croup. The age of the patients ranged between 3 days and 76 years. The majority of samples were collected during autumn and winter.

Duplex PCR (dPCR) was designed to detect influenza A and B viruses.

Triplex PCR (tPCR1) contained three other primer sets, which targeted the fusion protein gene of respiratory syncytial virus (from nucleotides 6227 to 6466), the hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase gene of parainfluenza virus\u20101 (from nucleotides 7372 to 7551), and the fusion protein gene of parainfluenza virus\u20103 (from nucleotides 5073 to 4907) [Grondahl et al., 1999]. The third PCR was also a tPCR (tPCR2), and was designed to detect human rhinoviruses, human coronavirus\u2010229E, and human coronavirus\u2010OC43. tPCR2 contained three other primer sets which targeted the VP4 protein of human rhinoviruses (from nucleotides 452 to 566) [Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1997], and N protein of human coronavirus\u2010299E, human coronavirus\u2010OC43 (nucleotides 762\u20131219 and 655\u20131025, respectively) [Vabret et al., 2001].",

Also very importantly that 50.5% who had rhinoviruses were infants aged <1 year. Significantly, 42% of the patients infected with rhinoviruses had pneumonia and 36.8% had bronchiolitis.

Also Gruteke et al. 2004 found that nasopharyngeal aspirates were important for the isolation and detection of any respiratory virus.",
