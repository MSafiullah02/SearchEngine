            "text": "The world was made aware of a newly discovered coronavirus via an email from Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian virologist working at the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The email was published on the website of the professional emerging diseases (ProMED) network on 20-September-2014 (ProMED, 2014). That first case was a 60 year old man from Bisha in the KSA and, thanks to the email, the rapid discovery of a second case of the virus, this time in an ill patient from Qatar, was transferred to the United Kingdom for care (Fig. 1\n) (Bermingham et al., 2012). As of 20th January 2015, there have been 969 detections of viral RNA or virus-specific antibodies reported publicly, 955 confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with over a third of the positive people dying (n\n = 351, 37%; data from public sources including the WHO and Ministries of Health). First known as novel coronavirus (nCoV), the following two to three years were a slow discovery process revealing a virus that appears well established among dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. From infected DCs, the virus is thought to infrequently infect exposed humans. Concern was raised early on that patenting of the first viral isolate would lead to restricted access to the virus and to viral diagnostics (Sciencemag, 2014). However, sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics were available (Abdel-Moneim, 2014) almost immediately. Virus was also made freely available subject to routine biosafety considerations, supporting many of the research findings described herein. In search of an animal host, bats were implicated in August 2013 (Memish et al., 2013a) but in that same month a DC link was reported (Reusken et al., 2013c) and that link has matured into a verifiable association. In humans, overt disease was finally given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome and the acronym MERS. From these animal-to-human spillover events, the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV; see Section 3 for variation in naming) spread sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older males with underlying diseases. The proportion of infected people who are confirmed to have died from MERS-CoV infection is much higher than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, influenza virus or many other pathogens. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, which in 2012\u20132014 usually commenced in March (Mackay, 2014, Maltezou and Tsiodras, 2014). This spread may be linked to some seasonal environmental changes, change in host animal behaviour, or perhaps simple coincidence between season and successive hospital outbreaks. Approximately a fifth of all cases to date have involved healthcare workers (HCWs), spiking alongside periods of increased total case numbers. Social media, blogs and the mainstream media have kept close tabs on the spread of MERS-CoV to 23 countries in Europe, Asia and the United States of America (USA; Fig. 2\n), mostly with an origin in the KSA from where 88% of viral detections have occurred. Twitter in particular has provided a global forum through specific hashtags like #MERS and the Arabic hashtag #\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0627 or #Coruna. An engaged world has helped understand how the virus has affected the KSA and its neighbouring countries and allowed outsiders to view science musings take shape, collaborations form, local news and commentary trend and new results be discussed in real time. Social media provides new avenues for scientists to express experienced opinion, to more widely communicate their research and to engage with public health entities, the public themselves and the mainstream media. This degree of engagement was not possible in 2002/2003 when the SARS global outbreak began its rise to 8100 human cases including 770 deaths (proportion of fatal cases, or PFC, of 9.5%). The ubiquity of social media appears to have changed what the public expects from a State when it communicates about new or existing infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, and how quickly they expect that to occur.",

MERS-CoV may be identified in patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction which can precede death in over a third of infections (Arabi et al., 2014, Assiri et al., 2013a, Hijawi et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012). Extrapulmonary disease manifestations include circulatory, renal, hepatic and hematologic dysfunction. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen in 20\u201333% of cases (Assiri et al., 2013a, Mailles et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013b, Zumla and Memish, 2014), manifesting as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not seen at all in one family cluster (Omrani et al., 2013) nor among symptomatic children in another (Memish et al., 2014a). On occasion, fever and gastrointestinal upset may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline to be are later followed by more severe systemic and respiratory signs and symptoms (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014, Mailles et al., 2013). Rarely, MERS-CoV has been detected in a person with fever but no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms (Memish et al., 2014a). The extent to which infection by other gastrointestinal pathogens affect this variability is unknown.",

Only on rare occasions have studies described upper respiratory tract (URT) signs and symptoms. In one example, approximately 15\u201325% of cases presented with rhinorrhoea and/or sore throat MERS, 2014e, Memish et al., 2013b, Payne et al., 2014, Zumla and Memish, 2014). To date, MERS has been an opportunistic disease. Severe MERS has been defined by admission to an intensive care unit; use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mechanical ventilation or vasopressors; cases being reported as critical or severe; a fatal outcome (Arabi et al., 2014). The relative speed of disease progression may relate to MERS-CoV reaching earlier peak viral loads and infecting different cells than the SARS-CoV (Drosten, 2013). Nonetheless, it is also apparent that MERS is not restricted to those with comorbidities. With increased laboratory testing, particularly of contacts of confirmed MERS cases, a number of MERS-CoV positive individuals without comorbidities have been detected who experience a mild illness or no symptoms at all (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2014). This demonstrates that MERS, like most respiratory viruses, is associated with a wide spectrum of symptoms and degrees of severity.",

In a smaller study the incubation period ranged between one and nine days, with 13\u201314 days between when illness began in one person and subsequently spread to another (Memish et al., 2013b). The length and nature of the prodrome is undefined to date. The first WHO case definition (World Health Organization, 2014a) defined probable cases of MERS based on the presence of febrile illness, cough, requirement for hospitalization with suspicion of LRT involvement and included roles for contact with a probable or confirmed case or for travel or residence within the Arabian peninsula. If strictly adhered to, only the severe syndrome would meet the case definition and be subject to laboratory testing, which was the paradigm early on (Assiri et al., 2013a). From July 2013, the revised WHO case definition included the importance of seeking out and understanding the role of asymptomatic cases (World Health Organization, 2014d). Apart from reports from the WHO and KSA Ministry of Health, asymptomatic or subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection have also been documented in the scientific literature (Drosten et al., 2014b, Memish et al., 2014b). In one such case, a HCW shed virus for 42 days in the absence of disease (Al-Gethamy et al., 2014).",

Acute renal failure can occur in MERS patients, doing so sooner than it did among SARS patients (Eckerle et al., 2013). Progressive impairment of renal function and acute kidney injury can start 9\u201312 days after symptom onset among MERS patients, compared to a median of 20 days for SARS patients (Chu et al., 2005, Eckerle et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012). This may be due to direct infection of renal tissue by MERS-CoV (Arabi et al., 2014, Zaki et al., 2012).

A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother subsequently developed antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection (Payne et al., 2014). Her exposure history to a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive relative and an antibody-reactive husband, her incubation period and her symptom history met the WHO criteria for being a probable MERS-CoV case (Payne et al., 2014).",

The first full sequence defined a single-stranded, positive sense, 30,119 nucleotide (nt) long genome (Fig. 3\n) (van Boheemen et al., 2012, Zaki et al., 2012). Based on analysis of 42 complete sequences, the genome is predicted to be evolving at 1.12 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site (Cotten et al., 2014). This permitted a predictive calculation of the time to most recent viral ancestor (tMRCA) for most of the variants, which suggested MERS-CoV first appeared around March 2012 (ranging from December 2011 to July 2012) (Cotten et al., 2014). Comparison of the first open reading frame's (ORF 1ab) amino acid sequence to that from its closest betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, found there was less than 80% identity which supported the conclusion that MERS-CoV was a novel and distinct virus. This genomic region is a key taxonomic identifier of CoV species. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode at least ten open reading frames bracketed by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (Raj et al., 2014b). Structural proteins include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (van Boheemen et al., 2012). Nonstructural proteins (nsps) from the products of ORF1a and ORF1b have been predicted, following identification of conserved domains and after comparative analysis with other coronaviral proteins. The nsps include a papain-like protease (PLpro; nsp4 (Kilianski et al., 2013, Lin et al., 2014) transmembrane domains (nsp4, nsp6), a 3C-like protease (3CLpro; nsp5 (Kilianski et al., 2013)), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; nsp12), a helicase (nsp13) and an exonuclease (nsp14) (van Boheemen et al., 2012).",

While the error rate can be higher than for traditional Sanger sequencing, the near-complete genomic length covered by just a single run (e.g. 90% of the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 genome) and the depth of coverage at each nucleotide is such that deep sequencing corrects for erroneous nucleotide (Raj et al., 2014a, van Boheemen et al., 2012). Subgenomic sequencing, a mainstay of viral genotyping and molecular epidemiology to this point, has been used rarely for MERS-CoV identification or confirmation, despite assays having been suggested early on Corman et al. (2012b). Such an approach is simpler, more accessible to a wider range of laboratories and faster. It's utility has since been demonstrated using molecular assays to amplify and sequence a 615 nucleotide long fragment of the spike S2 domain gene fragment (Smits et al., 2015). This assay agreed with the results generated by the sequencing of full genomes and defined additional sequence groupings within an existing MERS-CoV clade. With the addition of more genomes over time from both humans and from DCs, two clades have become apparent; A and B. Clade A contains only human-derived MERS-CoV genomes (Fig. 4\n) (Cotten et al., 2013b).",

An alignment of 56 complete or near-complete MERS-CoV genomes sampled from 2012 to 2014 differed by 0\u20130.38%. For comparison, an alignment of 31 complete HCoV-NL63 genomes from samples collected between 1983 and 2009 shows they diverge by 0.5% at the nucleotide level (data not shown; theoretically equates to 145nt for a 27,553nt genome). There is as yet no study which attaches clinical relevance to the clades or smaller groupings of MERS-CoV nor any of the genomic variation noted to date (Drosten et al., 2015). It is interesting that Clade A contains only the African green monkey kidney (Vero; innate immune deficient cells) cell-culture passaged EMC/2012 variant and two variants of the Jordan-N3 variant from 2012, but no camel-derived MERS-CoV genomes (Cotten et al., 2013b). When the MERS-CoV genome of the variant from Bisha was re-sequenced directly from the original URT sample, the comparison of trimmed genomes (EMC/2012 vs. Bisha_1) revealed 115 nucleotide differences (0.38% difference) resolving Bisha_1 into Clade B (Cotten et al., 2013b). This is unusual because when a Jordan-N3 virus was intentionally serially passed through Vero or MRC5 cell culture (Jordan-N3/2012 MG167), only 2nt changes occurred within the entire coding region of the resultant sequence, despite eight passages (Frey et al., 2014). For comparison, after three passages through Vero cell culture, no genetic changes were found in a DC MERS-CoV variant of Qatar_2_2014 (Raj et al., 2014a).",

This lineage may represent additional diversity of MERS-CoV variants remaining to be discovered in DC from outside the Arabian peninsula. A virus sequenced from a Neoromicia capensis bat was more closely related to MERS-CoV than previous bat sequences had been, providing a link between human, camel and bat viruses as members of the same CoV species (Corman et al., 2014a). Despite usually comprising \u22641% of the total genome, in silico comparison shows that viral genetic changes among variants permit geographic tracking of the spread of variants and identification that Riyadh, in particular, harbours a wide range of MERS-CoV variants (Fig. 4) (Cotten et al., 2013b). This process of molecular epidemiology can also imply some physical direction to the movement of MERS-CoV around the region and over time (Cotten et al., 2014).",

Higher viral loads occur in the LRT compared to the URT, especially with increasing time from onset of symptoms (CDC, 2014, Drosten et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013b). Since the majority of disease symptoms appear to have been manifesting as systemic and LRT disease, this may not be surprising (Assiri et al., 2013a). However at writing, no human data exist to define whether the virus replicates solely in the LRT, the URT, has a preference for one over the other, or replicates in other human tissues in vivo. Sampling of the URT has been frequently noted from the largest human MERS-CoV investigative studies (Gautret et al., 2013, HPA, 2013, Memish et al., 2014b, Memish et al., 2014d) and, if noted, for other smaller investigative MERS-CoV testing (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2013b). In a macaque monkey model, MERS-CoV RNA was shed from both the URT and LRT (deWit et al., 2013). In a human case, throat swabs were positive for six days, and again after a gap (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014). In another case, a 40-year old female HCW shed MERS-CoV RNA from the URT (Ziad A. Memish, personal communication) for at least 42-days between April and June 2014 (Al-Gethamy et al., 2014). She did not show signs of disease during her time shedding virus. In a study of MERS cases in an intensive care setting, three of 12 patients shed virus for 12\u201322 days (Arabi et al., 2014). Elsewhere, viral RNA was detected in human oronasal swabs for 16 days (Drosten et al., 2013) and in pharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates for 24 days (Spanakis et al., 2014). Over three quarters of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their lower respiratory tract specimens (tracheal aspirates and sputum) for at least 30 days while only 30% of contacts were still shedding RNA in their upper respiratory specimens (Memish et al., 2014e).",

Lung biopsy or autopsy tissues can also be tested if available (World Health Organization, 2013b). From the URT, which is a less invasive and convenient sampling site, a combined nose and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate is recommended (CDC, 2014).

When viruses are sought, they include some of the following: human herpesvirus (HHV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs), influenzaviruses (IFVs), endemic HCoVs, adenoviruses (AdVs) and metapneumovirus (MPV) and co-detections with MERS-CoV do occur (Bermingham et al., 2012, Drosten et al., 2013, HPA, 2013, Memish et al., 2013b). When included, other viruses are often absent in the samples positive for MERS-CoV (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014, Bermingham et al., 2012, Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014, Omrani et al., 2013) but have been found in samples negative for MERS-CoV during such rare MERS investigations (Reuss et al., 2014). Tests on the first human case in the KSA used a LRT sample to isolate MERS-CoV in culture, conduct immunofluorescence for some viruses (negative for IFV, PIVs, RSV and AdVs) and RT-PCR for other viruses (negative for AdV, EVs, MPV and HHVs) (Zaki et al., 2012). RT-PCR also detected MERS-CoV. A case exported to Greece in April-2014 was tested (and found negative) for IFVs, Legionella and Pneumococcus (Tsiodras et al., 2014). Other bacterial testing has been conducted but the impact of bacterial co-presence is also unclear (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014, Devi et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2013b, Tsiodras et al., 2014). Two MERS cases that travelled from the KSA to the Netherlands were negative for RSV, AdV, bocavirus (BoV), PIVs, HCoVs, HRV, IFVs, RSV and MPV (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014). Testing for other respiratory pathogens is strongly recommended (World Health Organization, 2013b) but limited data address the occurrence of co-infections or alternative viral diagnoses among both cases and contacts suspected of MERS-CoV infection. Little is known of other causes of MERS-like pneumonia in the KSA or of the general burden of disease due to the known classical respiratory viruses including endemic other human coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Despite widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a source for MERS-CoV, no strategic and widespread sero-surveys have been conducted in humans using samples collected post-2012. The development of robust serological assays hinges on the accessibility of a reliable panel of well-characterised animal or human sera including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV and to likely agents of cross-reaction (Meyer et al., 2014a). Obtaining these control materials has been problematic and has slowed the development and commercialization of assays for human testing (Meyer et al., 2014a). One company has produced an ELISA kit to detect IgG in camels using a recombinant S1 receptor-binding subunit of MERS-CoV S protein as the antigen and produces a diagnostic reagent for immunofluorescence (Drosten et al., 2014b, EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AGf, 2014). Sero-surveys are essential to determine a baseline of animal and community exposures to MERS-CoV among countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Early sero-surveys of humans used conventional immunofluorescent assays (IFA) in which antibodies, if present in patient sera, attach to MERS-CoV infected cell cultures to identify the presence of IgG, IgM or neutralising antibodies (Corman et al., 2012b, Drosten et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012). No sign of MERS-CoV antibody was found among 2400 sera from patients visiting the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, KSA from 2010 through 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012), and no sign of prior MERS-CoV infection was found among 130 healthy blood donors screened at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah (collected between January and December 2012). Eight of 226 slaughterhouse workers were positive by IFA, but those results could not be confirmed by neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of cross-reactive antigen by IFA (Aburizaiza et al., 2014). An absence of MERS-CoV antibodies among slaughterhouse workers may reflect the killing of older DCs which are less often MERS-CoV positive (see Table 1\n), the rarity of infected animals, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs (Aburizaiza et al., 2014), a weak immune response by humans who do not get severe MERS, or an overall low risk of MERS-CoV transmission by contact. IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera which could not be resolved by an NT test (Chan et al., 2013b). The need for well-validated assays was further emphasised when publicly released MERS-CoV antibody test results indicated that a handshake and two face-to-face meetings were sufficient for MERS-CoV transmission between two people in the USA (CDC Newsroom, 2014, Sampathkumar, 2014). These results were subsequently retracted because they did not withstand further confirmatory analysis with the less rapid, but highly specific, NT assay (CDC Newsroom, 2014).",

Recombinant lentiviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein and luciferase are also safer and simpler diagnostic alternatives to working with infectious MERS-CoV (Perera et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2013). A pseudo particle neutralization (ppNT) assay has seen widespread use in animal studies and is at least as sensitive as the microneutralization (MNT) test (Hemida et al., 2013, Hemida et al., 2014a, Hemida et al., 2015, Perera et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2013b). In a study of sera collected at the King Fahd Hospital, Eastern region of the KSA (158 from children with LRT infections between May 2010 and May 2011 and 110 from 19 to 52 year old male blood donors) no evidence of MERS-CoV neutralising antibody could be found using the ppNT assay (Gierer et al., 2013). Similarly, in a study of four herdsmen in contact with an infected DC herd in Al-Ahsa, eight people who had intermittent contact with the herd, 30 veterinary surgeons and support staff who were not exposed to the herd, three unprotected abattoir workers in Al-Ahsa and 146 controls who were not exposed to camels in any professional role, none had serological evidence of past MERS-CoV infection using the ppNT assay (Hemida et al., 2015).",

            "text": "MERS-CoV does not appear to be easily transmitted from DCs to humans, or perhaps it does not trigger a detectable immune response if only mild disease or asymptomatic infection results. A study of such cases is an important missing link for interpretation of these negative human serology data. A Jordanian outbreak of acute LRT disease in a hospital in Al-Zarqa in 2012, which predated the first KSA case of MERS, was retrospectively found to have been associated with MERS-CoV infection, initially via RT-rtPCR, but subsequently, and on a larger scale, using positivity by ELISA and IFA or MNT test (Al-Abdallat et al., 2014, Hijawi et al., 2013, Payne et al., 2014). The ELISA used a recombinant N protein from the group 2 betacoronavirus (Pipistrellus) bat-CoV HKU5 to identify antibodies against the equivalent cross-reactive MERS-CoV protein and was validated using 545 sera including some from people known to have had previous HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HRV, HMPV or influenza A(H1N1) infections (Al-Abdallat et al., 2014). A protein microarray expressing the S1 protein subunit has also been validated and widely used for DC testing (see Table 1) (Reusken et al., 2013a) but not for human screening to date. Using the most immunogenic portion or subunit of a specific viral antigen is considered the best approach for producing reliable serological assays (Meyer et al., 2014a). Detection of MERS-CoV infection using ELISA or S1 subunit protein microarray (Reusken et al., 2013a) has usually been followed by confirmatory IFA and/or a plaque-reduction neutralization (PRNT) test (Aburizaiza et al., 2014, Drosten et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2013c) or MNT test (Meyer et al., 2014b, Perera et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2013c). The confirmatory methods ensure the antibodies detected using more subjective screening methods that may also employ a spectrum of potentially cross-reactive antigens, are able to specifically neutralise the intended virus and are not more broadly reactive to other coronaviruses found in DCs (bovine CoV, BCoV) or humans (HC0V-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV).",

It is noteworthy that diabetes is also one of the underlying diseases among two thirds of MERS-CoV positive people and that renal damage features among patients with severe disease (Assiri et al., 2013a). When a pseudovirus expressing the MERS-CoV S protein was used to examine the binding of S to the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ACE2), MHV (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule; CEACAM1) or HCoV-229E (CD13) which were expressed in non-permissive 293T cells, it did not enter those cells, indicating these were not the receptor molecules for MERS-CoV (Payne et al., 2014). When ACE2 was expressed in otherwise non-permissive BHK cells, only SARS-CoV could infect them (Muller et al., 2012). Additionally, blockade of ACE2 by antibodies only prevented SARS-CoV infection of cells otherwise permissive to that virus while MERS-CoV could still infect them (Muller et al., 2012).",

The receptor's identity was confirmed by the use of soluble DPP4 to competitively inhibit MERS-CoV infection of Vero cells as well as by transient expression of DPP4 in COS-7 cells which rendered them permissive to MERS-CoV (Memish et al., 2014f, Raj et al., 2013). Anti-DPP4 antibodies also blocked human and DC MERS-CoV variants from infecting otherwise permissive human bronchial epithelial cells or Huh-7 cells respectively (Raj et al., 2013) while inhibitors of the DPP4 function did not, indicating that structure, rather than function, was important for MERS-CoV attachment (Raj et al., 2013).",

            "text": "DPP4 RNA-positive cells were detected by RT-PCR derived from goat lung, alpaca kidney, camel umbilical cord, bat kidney, human lung and monkey kidney (Eckerle et al., 2014). DPP4 protein was also found on epithelial cells of different species from organs including the kidney and renal ducts, small intestine, lung, umbilical cord, liver, prostate, activated leukocytes and in elevated levels in a soluble form in the blood of those with allergic asthma (Lun et al., 2007, Raj et al., 2013). Limited DPP4 expression was found in the lung of MERS-CoV non-permissive animals including mice and Syrian hamsters, but it was present. DPP4 expression was also seen in ferret, DC, sheep, goat and cow bronchial/bronchiolar tissues and renal tubular tissues (Coleman et al., 2014b, van Doremalen et al., 2014). When the structure of DPP4 from animals was modelled, a host-barrier restriction was predicted to exist among different mammals; DPP4 was present but some animals do not support MERS-CoV infection (van Doremalen et al., 2014). When a human DPP4 was \u201chamsterized\u201d by exchanging five key MERS-CoV S-protein-interacting residues and introduced into non-permissive BHK cells, they were not rendered permissive, whereas introduction of the human DPP4 into BHK cells successfully permitted their infection (van Doremalen et al., 2014). Because of the high affinity of MERS-CoV for human DPP4, similar to that for animal DPP4 molecules, it is possible that the MERS-CoV which was detected in humans in 2012 was already modestly adapted to humans and that both DCs and horses, and to a lesser extent goats, should all be considered as sources for intrusion of the virus into human populations because of their degree of binding affinity (Barlan et al., 2014, Raj et al., 2014a). To date, no sign of natural MERS-CoV infection has been found in goat, sheep, cow or alpaca, despite small seroprevalence studies. However, the DPP4 data suggest the possibility and these animals should be further examined as potential animal hosts (see Table 1 for detail on DCs).",

            "text": "Neither mice nor Syrian hamsters have supported natural MERS-CoV replication (Coleman et al., 2014b, Drosten, 2013). To get around the divergence between murine and human DPP4, a mouse model was constructed by introducing a human DPP4 gene (Zhao et al., 2014). An adenoviral vector carrying the gene transduced cells in the mouse airway resulting in animals that were receptive to MERS-CoV infection for 17\u201322 days. Infection induced pneumonia in the animals and viral clearance followed 6\u20138 days after infection (Zhao et al., 2014). The model found limited cross-protection afforded by prior exposure to SARS-CoV. Using this model, a Venezuelan equine encephalitis-based replicon expressing MERS-CoV spike protein was shown to be an efficacious vaccine candidate, producing a protective immune response (Zhao et al., 2014). Subsequently a transgenic mouse model was created in which the human DPP4 was globally expressed resulting in a fully permissive model of severe MERS (Agrawal et al., 2015). A report of a mouse model for infection by a MERS-CoV close relative, batCoV HKU5, noted that vaccine designs for any emerging CoV should include elements from that particular virus since different members of the same genus are insufficiently similar to elicit immunological cross-protection (Agnihothram et al., 2014). Use of transduced knockout mice revealed that TLR-dependent and IFN-signalling pathways were important for control of MERS-CoV replication (Zhao et al., 2014). Pre-infection delivery of poly I:C, IFN\u03b2 or IFN\u03b3 speeded the clearance of MERS-CoV from infected mice and did so more effectively than if poly I:C was given post-infection (Zhao et al., 2014). IFN\u03b12b given with ribavirin improved clinical status and virological control in macaques, in association with reduced systemic and local levels of proinflammatory markers and viral load (Falzarano et al., 2013). T-cells were shown to be necessary for virus clearance in mice and immunodominant epitopes attracting CD8 T-cell responses are present in the MERS-CoV S protein (Zhao et al., 2014). The mouse model has shown that immune-deficient mice succumbed to more severe disease, as do humans with comorbidities that may affect their immune function.",

            "text": "To date the only non-transduced animal model for MERS-CoV infection is the rhesus macaque monkey; an expensive animal to house and work with. A multi-site infection protocol delivered 7 \u00d7 106 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of MERS-CoV to 6\u201312 year old macaques via a combination of intranasal, oral, ocular and intratracheal routes attempting to recreate the disease seen in humans (Yao et al., 2014). This resulted in a transient mild-to-moderate clinical disease, including a leucocytosis, with acute localised-to-widespread radiographic changes consistent with pneumonia (Munster et al., 2013). Three days after infection, viral RNA was detected in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa and also at day six in the tonsils, trachea, bronchus, mediastinal lymph nodes and lung, but mostly at reduced levels to those from day three (deWit et al., 2013). By day six, virus was mostly undetectable in the URT, generally decreasing in quantity by day three and at its highest load one day after inoculation (deWit et al., 2013). This is much shorter than has been found when serial samples from a human case were analysed (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014). Shedding from the respiratory tract continued until day six in two of three macaques (deWit et al., 2013). Levels of viral RNA remained high in BAL samples on day one and three (deWit et al., 2013). Virus or viral RNA was not found in the kidney, nor were pathological kidney changes or kidney failure noted among macaques (deWit et al., 2013, Yao et al., 2014). Microarray analysis of MERS-CoV infected macaque samples identified a rapid innate immune activation with increased expression of genes involved in proinflammatory processes and cell recruitment including interleukin 6 (IL-6), chemokine C-X-C ligand 1 (CXCL1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) (deWit et al., 2013). By day six post inoculation, gene expression in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lung had returned to baseline (deWit et al., 2013). While the viral dosage and spread of delivery may be unrealistic, we have since learned that much milder disease is not uncommon among MERS-CoV-positive humans, especially those who are younger and do not have underlying comorbidities. The macaque model fulfilled the need to see a purified viral preparation produce disease akin to that seen among some human cases (Munster et al., 2013). The direct LRT component of virus delivery in this model likely reflects some proportion of the human route of virus acquisition and some of the notable human disease involving the LRT. However, it may also bias against study of any potential URT response to first contact between virus and host and therefore overlook routes of ingress and the length and nature of the prodrome. While MERS-CoV is believed to the cause of MERS in humans, such causality can only be extrapolated from these studies in the macaque model (Munster et al., 2013).",

These comprised bronchial epithelial cells that had been differentiated at the air liquid interface to contain basal, secretory, columnar and ciliated cells that generated mucous (Kindler et al., 2013). This system aimed to recreate the main epithelial lining which is possibly the site of first contact between host and MERS-CoV (Kindler et al., 2013). Pre-treatment of cultures with interferon \u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) and IFN\u03b33 proved effective at reducing the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E (Kindler et al., 2013). When IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 was added to ex vivo bronchial or lung tissues one hour after MERS-CoV infection, virus titre and RNA levels decreased more noticeably for MERS-CoV than for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also elicited a comparatively poor proinflammatory and cytokine response, but to the same extent as when pre-treated (Chan et al., 2013c). MERS-CoV failed to induce IFN\u03b2 or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) or to upregulate IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1 or regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) mRNA (Chan et al., 2013c). However, MERS-CoV was perhaps a better replicator in these tissues than SARS-CoV and it's targeting of Type I and Type II alveolar cells within the lungs indicated its potential to hinder lung regeneration after infection, since Type II cells are important for repair (Chan et al., 2013c). By comparison, HCoV-229E, a generally more mild pathogen, did not replicate in lung tissue while influenza A(H5N1) virus, known to be associated with viral pneumonia, did (Chan et al., 2013c).",

            "text": "Further immunobiological analysis using cell lines supported that MERS-CoV grows better, but is more sensitive to IFN\u03b2, than SARS-CoV. MERS-CoV is also a very weak inducer of IFN, most likely through an immune dampening effect that both it and SARS-CoV mediate via retention of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Zielecki et al., 2013). MERS-CoV was again shown to be more sensitive to IFN\u03b2, although this was based on pre-treatment of cells, a situation that does not mimic clinical reality for human cases of MERS (Zielecki et al., 2013). Kindler et al. noted that the comparatively limited transcriptional response after infection of HAE cultures by any CoV, with no induction of IFN\u03b2 and only mild induction of proinflammatory cytokines, may mean that MERS-CoV is already adapted to growing in these cells (Kindler et al., 2013). Professional cytokine-producing cells such as plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells and macrophages were lacking in the HAE system but were present in the ex vivo tissues above. These cells are needed to see the full extent of the immune response to CoVs (Kindler et al., 2013). Use of an embryonal lung fibroblast cell line (HFL), to allow growth of HCoV-229E, identified more IFN\u03b2 and IP-10 induction than that by MERS-CoV. In polarised Calu-3 cells, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV differed in their elicitation of cytokine gene transcription (Lau et al., 2013). In a three-way virus comparison of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, 15 cellular mRNAs were analysed in response to type I IFN and type III IFN and CoV infection (Kindler et al., 2013). Proinflammatory gene (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8) mRNA (and IL-8 protein) levels were increased in MERS-CoV infections compared to SARS-CoV, while innate antiviral genes (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 [and protein] and IP-10) were comparatively decreased from 30 h post-infection (Lau et al., 2013). Apart from a reduced innate antiviral response, timing of the response also differed, with MERS-CoV appearing to delay cytokine induction. MERS-CoV produced less IL-8 or IFN\u03b2 at 48 h compared to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV also grew less efficiently and destructively than MERS-CoV in Calu-3 cells, as it did in primary bronchial and primary kidney cells and it took longer to reach peak viral production (Eckerle et al., 2013, Kindler et al., 2013).",

Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV grew with similar kinetics in Calu-3 cells (Zielecki et al., 2013), but Josset et al. noted MERS-CoV induced more significant cytopathic changes accompanying earlier and distinctive changes to the global transcriptome (Josset et al., 2013). Fourteen-fold more differentially expressed genes were noted from MERS-CoV; uniquely down-regulated genes related to antigen presentation and lymphocyte signalling and up-regulated related to cAMP-mediated signalling and ubiquitination (Josset et al., 2013). The increased relative growth of SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells compared to using HAE cultures above might reflect the latter's variable expression of the SARS-CoV receptor (Josset et al., 2013). While Kindler et al. found little IFN\u03b2 produced up to 24 h after infection in HAE cultures, Josset et al. identified upregulation of IFN\u03b15 and IFN\u03b21 from 18 h in response to MERS-CoV infection of the Calu-3 cell line, perhaps indicating some post-pattern recognition differences in IFN induction between cell types (Josset et al., 2013, Kindler et al., 2013). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV upregulated viral recognition and innate immune pathway activation genes (IL17-related and interferon regulatory factor [IRF]) and down-regulated metabolic genes (Josset et al., 2013). Because of the rapidity of MERS-CoV host cell expression changes, post-infection treatment with a kinase inhibitor was not as effective as pre-treatment (Josset et al., 2013), reinforcing the challenges faced in treatment of MERS cases who present once disease processes are well engaged.",

Interestingly, MERS-CoV antigens were not found to co-localise with macrophages in infected ex vivo lung tissue (Chan et al., 2013c). In contrast to the work in the HAE system, dendritic cell infection resulted in up-regulation of IFN\u03b1 (though not IFN\u03b2) and of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 (Zhou et al., 2014). Also, infection triggered significantly higher levels of IP-1o and RANTES than the equivalent dose of SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2014). In clinical practice, two MERS patients in France were found to differ in their IFN\u03b1 responses (Faure et al., 2014). Patient 1, who died, did not mount a robust type I IFN response while Patient 2, who survived, did mount a response; particularly notable in Patient 1 was the absence of IFN\u03b1 and comparatively little RIG-I, MDA5, IRF3, IRF7, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 (Faure et al., 2014). IFN\u03b1 promotes the antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response to clear virus. Patient 1 also had a comparatively increased level of IL-1o (with its immunosuppressive role (Sabat, 2010)), a spike in CXCL10 (a proinflammatory role) late in the course of disease and both patients had raised IL-17A (also proinflammatory).",

            "text": "An animal as source and intermediate host(s) were considered very early on in the MERS outbreak with three of the first five cases having contact with DCs (Albarrak et al., 2012, ProMED, 2012, Reuss et al., 2014). While unclear at that time, approximately 12 MERS-CoV detections from a community outbreak in Hafr Al-Batin between June and August 2013 were possibly triggered by the index case having had DC contact (Memish et al., 2014g). Today, animal MERS-CoV infections must be reported to the world organization for animal health (OIE) as an emerging disease (2014f). Animal contact with humans was defined in a summary of the first MERS cases as being direct and within 10 days prior to symptom onset (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013). This definition made no specific allowance for acquisition through a droplet-based route, which is still assumed to be the most common route for acquisition of a virus that predominantly causes respiratory disease (Assiri et al., 2013a, Assiri et al., 2013b, Zumla and Memish, 2014). Providing some support for a droplet transmission route, one report identified viral RNA in an air sample collected in a barn housing an infected DC (Azhar et al., 2014b). The precise route by which humans acquire MERS-CoV remains unproven. From early on and continuing throughout the MERS epidemic in the KSA, older human males have featured prominently, especially among index cases, implying behavioural factors may play a role (Penttinen et al., 2013), and these factors may provide important clues as to why so few human cases report DC contact and are reported to have had contact with an infected human, leaving this group without any obvious route of acquisition (Fig. 7\n). Whether the above definition of animal contact is sufficient to capture exposure to this respiratory virus remains unclear. Cases are sometimes listed in WHO disease notices as being in proximity to camels or farms, but individuals may have denied coming into contact with the animals. No alternative path for acquiring infection is reported in many of these instances. Fewer than half of human cases have reported camel contact (Gossner et al., 2014) but what constitutes a definition of \u201ccontact\u201d during these interviews is unclear. In a May 2014 WHO update and risk assessment, specific wording focused on consumption of camel products while equivalent wording was not used to ascribe risk to a potential droplet route for acquisition of MERS-CoV from DC. For example:\u201cUntil more is understood about MERS, people at high risk of severe disease (those with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons), should take precautions when visiting farms and markets where camels are present. These precautions include: avoiding contact with camels; not drinking raw camel milk or camel urine; and not eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked\u201d (World Health Organization, 2014c).\n",

Nonetheless, to date the only MERS-CoV-specific data pointing to bats originate with a 190nt amplified fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of the MERS-CoV genome identified in the fecal pellet from an insectivorous Emballonuridae bat, Taphozous perforatus, commonly called the Egyptian tomb bat, from Bisha, KSA (Memish et al., 2013a). While very short, the sequence of the fragment defined it as a diagnostic discovery and at writing no better sequence match exists on the GenBank sequence database. Unfortunately further sequence from this sample could not be obtained because the cold chain was broken when samples shipped to the USA for study thawed and decayed.

Camel densities are greatest in and around the horn of Africa, specifically Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan (Gossner et al., 2014). Near the KSA, Yemen has the highest density of camels, and within the country the Ha\u2019il region is most densely populated with DCs (Gossner et al., 2014) despite there being no human MERS cases from this region. Contact may be commonplace and could occur in variety of ways (Fig. 8\n). There are several large well-attended festivals, races, sales and parades which feature DCs and DCs are also kept and bred close to populated areas in the KSA (2014d). DC milk and meat are widely collected and consumed and the DC is an animal of ritual significance after the Hajj pilgrimage. However, MERS-CoV infection frequency appears much lower than does the more widespread and frequent habit of eating, drinking and preparing camel products. Daily ingestion of fresh unpasteurised DC milk is common among the desert Bedouin and many others in the KSA. Apart from its nutritional value, other perceived health benefits and availability, camel milk has been reported as an adjunct to standard type 1 diabetes management (Agrawal et al., 2009, Mohamad et al., 2009). DC urine is also consumed or used for supposed health benefits including a belief that it will keep hair parasite-free and has reported application as an aspirin-like anti-platelet-aggregation substance (Alhaidar et al., 2011) and as a specific anti-cancer and immune modulation substance (Al-Yousef et al., 2012).",

DCs were sampled from a mostly Canary Island-born (originally imported from the Horn of Africa in the 15th century) herd and from Omani DCs (mostly imported in high numbers and with high turnover, from Africa) retired from racing and tested using a protein microarray that expressed a portion of the receptor-binding S1 subunit of the S proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 (Reusken et al., 2013a, Reusken et al., 2013c). A range of other animals was also tested. All non-DC sera tested negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. A neutralising antibody assay found that 10% of strongly seropositive Canary Island DC sera could neutralise the virus while all of the Omani DC sera had high levels of specific MERS-CoV neutralising antibody (Reusken et al., 2013c). This indicated that DCs had in the past been infected by MERS-CoV, or a very similar virus, but its spread to camels beyond these borders remained unclear.",

Other animals tested include sheep, cows, pigs, horses, birds, water buffalo, goats, Bactrian camels, llamas and guanaco (south American camelids). Many of these animals have only been tested in small numbers and rats, mice, cats, and baboons (wide-ranging in Saudi Arabia and known to come into contact with humans and travel to caves possibly frequented by bats) have yet to be tested at all (Alagaili et al., 2014, Alexandersen et al., 2014, Meyer et al., 2014b, Perera et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2013b, Reusken et al., 2013c).

Subsequently, diagnostic detection of MERS-CoV RNA and recovery of infectious virus has occurred from DC samples (Alagaili et al., 2014, Azhar et al., 2014a, Chu et al., 2014, Haagmans et al., 2014, Hemida et al., 2014a, Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014, Raj et al., 2014a) and from some of these, the full or majority length genomes of MERS-CoV have been sequenced (Chu et al., 2014, Haagmans et al., 2014, Hemida et al., 2014a). These findings confirmed that DC versions of MERS-CoV were at least as similar to and just as genetically phylogentically interleaved, as were variants detected from different humans over time and across distance (Fig. 4).

In adults, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody suggesting re-infection is also possible (Hemida et al., 2014a). Viral loads among positive camels can be very high (Alagaili et al., 2014, Hemida et al., 2013, Hemida et al., 2014a, Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014) and camels have been found positive both when ill with URT respiratory signs (Adney et al., 2014, Azhar et al., 2014a, Hemida et al., 2014a, Memish et al., 2014f) or not obviously unwell. These findings indicate camels can host natural MERS-CoV infections. Furthermore, stored camel sera have revealed signs of MERS-CoV in camels which date back over two decades (Alagaili et al., 2014, Alexandersen et al., 2014). Older sera have not been tested and so precisely how long camels have been afflicted by MERS-CoV, whether the virus is enzootic among them, only introduced to them 20-years ago from bats, or they are the subject of regular but short-lived viral incursions perhaps occasionally from humans themselves, cannot yet be answered.",

            "text": "The next step was to prove a direction for infection; were DCs transmitting virus to humans or were humans infecting camels? At a Qatari site, a farm owner and his employee became ill in mid-October 2013 and tested positive for MERS-CoV RNA in a sputum and throat swab sample, respectively. RT-rtPCRs found MERS-CoV RNA in 11 of 14 positive camel nasal swabs at the farm; six (43%) met the international criteria of being positive by two or more assays (Haagmans et al., 2014). These results indicated a recent outbreak had occurred in this herd; the first indication of MERS-CoV RNA found within DCs with a temporal association to human infections. Three positive DC samples were confirmed by sequencing a 358nt portion of the S gene; these sequences were identical to each other, with close homology to other human and camel MERS-CoV sequences (Haagmans et al., 2014). The DCs and human contacts yielded ORF1a and ORF4b sequences differing by only a single nucleotide each, clustering closely with the Hafr-Al-Batin_1_2013 variant (Haagmans et al., 2014). Subsequently, another case study found evidence of a concurrent human and camel infection and the direction of that infection was inferred to be from the ill DCs and to their human owners (Azhar et al., 2014a, Drosten et al., 2014a, Memish et al., 2014f). Partial genome sequences indicated that a human and a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive camel had been infected by a variant of the same virus, harbouring the same distinct pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms (Memish et al., 2014f). All nine camels in the owner's herd, serially sampled, reacted in a recombinant S1 antigen ELISA, with the two animals that had been RT-rtPCR positive showing a small, verifiable rise in antibody titre (Memish et al., 2014f). A rise in titre theoretically begins 10\u201321 days after camel infection (Memish et al., 2014f). While samples were few, the authors of this and a subsequently published study of the same farmer and camel herd in which samples were collected a few days earlier, suggested that the rise in titre in camel sera which occurred alongside a declining RNA load, while the patient was actively ill and hospitalised, indicated that the camels were infected first followed by the owner (Azhar et al., 2014a, Memish et al., 2014f). Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) antibodies were also present and rising in one of the two RT-rtPCR positive animals but no animal's antibodies could neutralise BCoV infection (Memish et al., 2014f).",

When three adult DCs were infected intranasally, intracheally and conjunctivally with 107 TCID50 of MERS-CoV in a study in the United States, an amount similar to that shed by an infected camel, mild URT disease and mostly URT-localised virus replication resulted (Adney et al., 2014). Infectious virus was also detected in the trachea and one of four lung lobes tested as well as in retropharyngeal, mediastinal, mesenteric, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. URT shedding of infectious virus continued for seven days after inoculation while viral RNA could be detected for 35 days in nasal swabs. Small quantities of viral RNA, but not culturable virus, were detected in exhaled breath but no virus or viral RNA was detected in serum or whole blood and no viral RNA could be detected in faeces or urine for 42 days post inoculation (Adney et al., 2014). A strong neutralising antibody response was produced by the camels from 14 days post inoculation.",

Parturition in DCs occurs in the winter months (early in the Gregorian calendar year) which may be a driver of the subsequent spike in human cases seen during 2013 and 2014 (Memish et al., 2014f). Juvenile camels appear to host active infection more often than adult camels and this may help explain why the slaughter of camels, which must be five years of age or older, does not contribute to significantly to exposure among slaughterhouse workers (Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014). Small numbers of tested DCs from Australia were not seropositive, but expanded virological investigations of Australian (a source of export) and African camels as well as bats may lead to findings of a more ancestral viral variant or more seropositive animals and geographic areas. Identifying the animal source for zoonotic spread is important to inform options for reducing human exposures (Corman et al., 2014b, Hemida et al., 2013).",

This is in keeping with HCoV-229E being capable of retaining viability in water for 2 days up to a predicted 588 days depending on the type of water and temperature (Gundy et al., 2009). MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22 \u00b0C but pasteurization ablated MERS-CoV infectivity (van Doremalen et al., 2013). In a subsequent study, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in the milk, nasal secretion and faeces of camels from Qatar (Reusken et al., 2014a).",

At 30 \u00b0C and 80% RH, MERS-CoV remained viable for 8 h and for 24 h at 30 \u00b0C, 30% RH (van Doremalen et al., 2013). By comparison, influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) could not be recovered in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells beyond 4 h under any conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2013). Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability decreased by 89% at 70% RH but only decreased 7% at 40% RH when an aerosol was generated at 20 \u00b0C while influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) decreased by 62% and 95% respectively (van Doremalen et al., 2013). MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated by SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2011) however for context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m, thus MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient (Knibbs et al., 2014). Such findings expand our understanding of the risks associated with bioaerosols for transmission of respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms. The nature and quality of air exchange, circulation and filtration is an important variable in risk measurement and reduction. Droplet spread between humans is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission and the need for droplet precautions has been emphasised after the Al-Ahsa hospital outbreak (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2014, Assiri et al., 2013a, Assiri et al., 2013b, Zumla and Memish, 2014). By extrapolation, aerosol-generating events involving camels (urination, defecation, and the processes of preparation and consumption of camel products) should be factored into risk measurement and reduction efforts and the need to define whether a more stringent level of personal protective equipment should be worn by HCWs and animal handlers remains a priority.",

            "text": "When the MERS-CoV detection tally sat below 120, analyses of the basic reproduction number (R\n0) \u2013 the average number of infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population \u2013 returned values below 1, indicating that a pandemic was not likely (Bauch and Oraby, 2013, Breban et al., 2013, Cauchemez et al., 2014, Poletto et al., 2013). With more data and correction for observation bias, this conclusion was maintained (Chowell et al., 2014). These analyses reflected charting of small public data sources and indicated that while cases could climb suddenly, such as during the Al-Ahsa outbreak (Assiri et al., 2013b), the climb was not logarithmic. Methods used in these studies vary but some make allowance for more extensive case numbers than may have been publicly reported (Cauchemez et al., 2014, Poletto et al., 2013). If R\n0 was greater than 1, sustained case climb would be expected. The impact of incomplete case contact tracing, limited community testing and clinically defined cases in the absence of laboratory confirmation might affect some R\n0 calculations and make it difficult to identify patterns among case occurrence. The implication is that more positives among these population groups could have occurred and thus a greater transmission efficiency and higher R\n0 value may be possible. When narrowing an analysis to index cases (the case with the earliest onset date of a cluster) and inferring secondary case numbers, one study predicted that the R\n0 could be slightly above 1.0 (0.8\u20131.3 with an upper bound of 1.2\u20131.5 depending on method used) (Cauchemez et al., 2014). This study hypothesised that a high proportion of infections were not being detected (Cauchemez et al., 2014). Similar analyses are awaited following the Jeddah-2014 outbreak.",

Index or sporadic cases have been older and it has yet to be established whether infections thought to have been acquired from an animal source produce a more severe outcome than those spread between humans (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013). Strategic sero-assays have yet to investigate the extent to which milder or asymptomatic cases contribute to the MERS-CoV transmission chain.

It is impossible to predict whether a MERS-CoV vaccine for human use will fall victim to a lack of commercial interest or remain relevant in the time it will take to be developed, however a vaccine for use in camels is a more practical option given the identity shared between human and camel viral variants and the apparent rarity of MERS-CoV spillover to humans. If applied to young camels ahead of their first virus acquisition, such a vaccine may be capable of eradicating MERS-CoV from herds. But if the source of camel infections is bats, newly imported camels or other herds, any vaccine would need to be used in an ongoing manner and be able to reach feral camel herds as well. Care of hospitalised patients remains supportive, with vigilance for complications (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013). No empirical use of antimicrobial agents has improved severe disease nor have high dose steroids succeeded in reversing the progression of respiratory disease (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013). The development and registration of drugs for human use is not suitably rapid to use effectively against an emerging infectious agent (de Wilde et al., 2014, Dyall et al., 2014).

In another study, 33 drugs with the ability to impart >50% inhibition upon MERS-CoV growth in culture have been described as candidates for future clinical MERS intervention studies (Dyall et al., 2014). These were also identified following investigation of pre-existing, FDA-approved clinical drugs and encompass 13 different classes of therapeutic (Dyall et al., 2014). A novel molecule, K22, showed promise both directly and as an example that it was possible to target and specifically disrupt very conserved viral replication processes such as double membrane vesicle-associated RNA replication, without causing cellular toxicity (Lundin et al., 2014).",

Macaques were infected with 7 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV and, 8 h after infection, they were treated with substantial amounts of subcutaneous IFN-\u03b12b along with intravenous ribavirin, followed by ribavirin doses intramuscularly every 8 h and with IFN-\u03b12b every 16 h until 72 h after infection (Falzarano et al., 2013). Treatment prevented any signs of increased respiration, leucocytosis (neutrophilia) or reduction in oxygen saturation seen in the untreated animals plus treated macaques had very little to no radiographic evidence of pneumonia (Falzarano et al., 2013). The viral load in daily BALs did not differ between treated and untreated macaques but loads were reduced in the treated animal's post-mortem tissues and fewer tissues were MERS-CoV RT-PCR positive. Since MERS seems to be a prolonged disease that is well engaged upon presentation for medical help, it is unclear how this drug cocktail could be delivered early enough to moderate severe disease. When trialled on five critically ill patients with comorbidities and a median time between hospitalization and treatment of 19 days (range 10\u201322 days), no response to treatment was evident (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014). When used as a primary treatment of an infected physician and as prophylaxis for his wife, it was unclear whether the cocktail had any effect (Khalid et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The WHO took the lead in collating data and providing an official voice for the emergence of MERS from 23rd September 2012 (Hartl, 2013, World Health Organization, 2014b). Through Global Alert and Response (GAR) Disease Outbreak News (DON) releases, the WHO kept the world updated with detailed, deidentified case information provided soon after they had been forwarded on to them from each country's Ministry of Health or equivalent, as per the transparency required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. However there were often delays in the posting of such information, most notably during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak when no new case details were confirmed by the WHO as originating from KSA for more than six weeks. Cases announced via the KSA Ministry of Health website have often had data inconsistencies including errors, format variations, have often lacked key information including dates, have presented deaths with insufficient information to permit linkage with the announced case and over one hundred cases remain devoid of all key data, excluding them from most epidemiological analyses. This was a particular problem during periods when rapid case accumulation became a concern for the global community. When available, WHO DONs fill in vital missing detail, with additional important demographic data like age, sex or essential dates permitting improved understanding of when illness onset occurred, when cases were hospitalised, whether they were asymptomatic and if the newly announced case was a contact of another case, an animal or an animal product. However DONs are only effective when the underlying data is forwarded to the WHO. Such comprehensive data permits other calculations, for instance the likely laboratory turnaround time, the possibility for nosocomial spread occurring and the location of cases as a determining factor in whether a cluster has become an outbreak or a local epidemic. WHO data can be viewed by the public but are also relied upon by WHO Member States\u2019 epidemiology analysts. Such experts report to many levels of Health management and government who seek to understand threats to their own population so as to make the most informed judgements. The decisions which follow may include the need to raise alert levels, prepare laboratory capacity, create educational materials, free specific response funds, ramp up messaging, manage and alter border controls or issue travel alerts. The activities of the WHO have been essential for global preparedness against MERS. The WHO rapidly and comprehensively adopted, updated and publicly promoted diagnostic tools and testing algorithms, case definitions and guidelines for investigations, research study protocols, IPC guidance, travel advice, risk assessments and summary updates via a purpose-built coronavirus-focussed website. Their social media unit strove to answer questions posed by everyone and anyone through Twitter, which in turn allowed users to take control of further disseminating the information they found most interesting, informative, relevant or concerning to others in their social networks; a process that can also be informative to public health bodies who seek to provide their clients the detail they desire. The role of WHO as a nexus for collaboration laid the groundwork for the accumulation and advancement of knowledge about MERS and the MERS-CoV through the formation of, and reporting by, the IHR (2005) Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV. Their role is to advise the WHO Director-General on the need for action and, as yet, no Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been declared. The IHR Emergency Committee has met eight times to date. Upon request, the WHO has also sent risk assessment teams to the region to gauge the MERS situation. Gregory H\u00e4rtl, Coordinator of the Department of Communications for the WHO, noted that \u201cthe more answers public health experts can provide now, the greater the public's trust in these institutions will be if and when the virus should become easily transmissible between humans and cause more widespread morbidity and mortality\u201d (Hartl, 2013). This is a comment that applies equally well to the emergence of any infectious disease. By comparison, officials within the KSA were widely and regularly criticised for moving slowly, shunning collaborations and failing to show proactive action in commencing local research into MERS, 2014c, Editorial, 2014, Holmes, 2014, Kupferschmidt, 2014, Reuters, 2014, World Health Organization, 2014f).",

This shift correlated with a change in the KSA Minister of Health, requests for help in containing the Jeddah-2014 outbreak and a new WHO risk assessment, which included mention of camels (World Health Organization, 2014e). Shortly thereafter, the KSA Deputy Minister for Public Health and lead author of most peer-reviewed MERS-CoV research, Professor Ziad Memish, was also asked to step down.

At this stage, many who follow infectious disease clusters, outbreaks and pandemics through social media are well informed by exposure to a distillation of the most recent events, reports, commentary and news stories from all over the world. Professionals who use this communication medium are clearly appreciated by their funding stakeholders, the public. Social media and blogs communicate with a much broader audience than is usually reached by the traditional scientific literature and they are more accessible to the local and global communities who contribute to the funds that researchers so dearly seek. Sometimes these forms of mass communication are useful to those seeking information about a disease outbreak in their own country. Sometimes they are entirely misleading. The public audience may not spend the time and mostly do not have the background expertise to interpret the densely presented, often slow to appear, scientific and public health literature. The space between the scientific literature and mainstream media is occupied by those science communicators who may, sometimes with and sometimes without relevant scientific training, be as up-to-date on their topics as the best academic epidemiologist. The President John F. Kennedy quote, \u201cOne person can make a difference, and everyone should try\u201d seems an apt one to describe these dedicated people who, often without any paid incentives, devote their personal time, effort and money to better understand and communicate about infectious disease. Frequently updated data repositories such as the small FluTrackers group constantly compile, actively curate and condense worldwide news sources into threads of information that often assemble into patterns that can predict emerging infectious disease events well before they reach the mainstream media, and their line list of MERS-CoV detections (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. 2014) has been a cornerstone of case numbering, detail and clarity; Crawford Kilian's H5N1 blog (Kilian, 2014) outstrips its name by providing links to other reliable sources as well as excerpts and highly eloquent and thought-provoking commentary on a range of microbial infectious disease stories, of which MERS-CoV is just one; Michael Coston's Avian Flu Diary (Coston, 2014) also focusses and comments on emerging infectious diseases augmented by astute and experienced public health commentary, resources and a large inventory of past posts that are used to good effect when creating new and informative ones; the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) is an internet-based reporting system maintained by a panel of authoritative professionals and rapporteurs who prepare daily digests of the latest infectious disease happenings which they freely circulate using widely read emails (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, 2014); for a more workforce-oriented view of MERS and infectious disease, Shane Granger's Random Analytics provides an excellent perspective of the less frequently discussed impact of infectious diseases on humans (Granger, 2012); my own blog, Virology Down Under seeks to distill some of the more complex virology-related happenings and present data on emerging viral disease in a more graphical, accessible and open access way (Mackay, 1997, Mackay, 2013); Maia Majumder who applies an engineering systems expertise to the epidemiology of the disease (Majumder, 2014). These are just a few resources and each is part of an interconnected web of other sources, contacts and personal experience that exist on the internet; they have all chased and tracked the emergence of MERS-CoV as doggedly as a professional science writer. Each resource is as distinct yet complimentary source of information that together are sometimes referred to as flublogia. While it is often overlooked and perhaps underestimated by some professional scientists and clinicians, flublogia compiles or uses publicly available, deidentified data and adds publicly relevant interpretation which is greatly appreciated, much more widely read and far, far more often cited than anything seen in the professional scientific literature. It is also a factual source of such information (Lau et al., 2014, Salathe et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The MERS-CoV appears to be an entrenched camel virus infecting the URT which may have its origins among bats. Human infection may result from rare zoonotic spillover to humans. Many potential animal, human and environmental sources await further testing but thanks to quick action, the sensitive and rapid molecular diagnostic tools required to achieve this goal have been in place and available since the virus was made known to the public. Serological tools for research application, after a much slower start, are now emerging as robust, validated and ready for wider use, with care. Commercial unavailability remains an issue for more widespread use and so collaboration with the relevant research groups must be the immediate option for future studies. The MERS-CoV can spread from human-to-human but seems to do so only sporadically and sustained chains of transmission have not been evident to date. There is also no evidence that MERS-CoV is a virus of pandemic concern, despite many opportunities for it to become so. But vigilance is key for a virus with a genetic makeup that has only been observed for three years. Of those known to be infected, over a third have died. Central to future vigilance is continued screening, sequencing, analysis and timely data sharing. While whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV, it remains a tool for experts and collaborations have again been key for less equipped or experienced researchers to decode the MERS-CoV as it moves through people, over time and across distance in the KSA and beyond its borders. A recently described routine genotyping target which is equivalently informative will also aid this vigilance. Nonetheless, figures modelling efficiency of transmission will need confirmation once better serological and RT-rtPCR-based studies of humans, covering more of the community, have been conducted. It has become very clear that the MERS-CoV may spread poorly from human-to-human, but that spread is at its most effective around a hospital environment. Indications are that this can be traced back to poor IPC practices and protocols (Brown, 2014, Editorial, 2014, Zumla and Hui, 2014). The virus has its greatest impact on those with underlying diseases and such cases, sometimes suffering multiple comorbidities, are likely to visit hospital for treatment, creating a perfect storm of exposure, transmission and mortality. Educational programmes will be important tools to combat the spread of MERS-CoV. While MERS and SARS have some similarities they also diverge significantly. Characteristics including the higher PFC among MERS cases (above 50% in 2013 and currently at 30\u201340%; well above the 9.5% of SARS), the association between fatal disease and older males with underlying comorbidities, the very broad tropism of MERS-CoV, its rapid in vitro growth, rapid induction of cytopathogenic change, robust yet distinct transcriptional responses, use of a different receptor, its induction of a more proinflammatory but reduced and delayed innate antiviral response and its sensitivity to external IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 all signal differences from SARS-CoV to some degree.",

From those studies conducted thus far that screen people beyond the most severely ill, there appears to be a 2\u20133% prevalence of MERS-CoV in the KSA with a 5% chance of secondary transmission within the household. Despite two mass gatherings that have afforded the virus many millions of opportunities to spread, there have, remarkably, been no reported outbreaks of MERS or MERS-CoV during or immediately after these events. Nonetheless, hospitals across the KSA continue to describe MERS cases and so the other 22 countries who have experienced MERS and the rest of the world remain on alert for imported cases, especially during and after mass gathering events including Umrah, Ramadan and Hajj pilgrimages.",

            "text": "The localised MERS-CoV epidemic reminds us of the importance of communication at all levels and perhaps the need to rethink how stakeholders are informed of the progress of chasing down and studying new disease threats. In May 2014, two cases of MERS-CoV were imported into the USA. A third person was proposed to be the first local transmission event but was subsequently declared a false-positive. These cases served as an excellent example of \u201cgumshoe epidemiology\u201d working alongside excellent public communication, comprehensive laboratory support and a well-prepared clinical capacity. Social and mainstream media and press conferences comprehensively informed the public of the extensive findings generated by expert health care supported by laboratory analysis. And yet lessons were still learned about balancing real-time transparency and the need for suitable laboratory confirmation of results. This case highlighted the effectiveness of social media in communicating digestible information to expectant stakeholders compared to the use of a generally slower and more elite peer-reviewed scientific publication pipeline which is often better suited to detailed research description over the long haul, but with some exceptions, a process unsuited for informing a concerned global and always-online public of potential threats to its immediate health or providing context to those threats. However, while MERS-CoV is not a rapidly spreading global contagion, it may evolve further to become that or another may emerge in the future and vigilance and rapid communication will be key to a timely response and early containment. Every time a new virus emerges, we learn more, requiring us to re-examine what we previously \u201cknew\u201d. One constant in all this however is the human; it is we who fan the flames of a disease cluster until it becomes an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Viruses do not emerge and gain a foothold without our aid, or our lapses in vigilance. MERS highlighted that some paradigms can be stumbling blocks to seeking and communicating knowledge and containing and understanding the spread and nature of a virus. It also served as yet another reminder to us that global human and animal health, politics, agriculture and economies are all intimately interwoven and it takes just a single tiny virus to tip a very fine balance.",
