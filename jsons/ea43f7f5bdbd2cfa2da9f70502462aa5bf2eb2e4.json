However, the high mortality in a wide range of larvae and juveniles caused by NNV is an intensive threat. Nevertheless, there is limited transcriptomic information available in relation to the molecular immune mechanism of sea perch against NNV infection. In this study, transcriptome sequencing libraries were generated from RGNNV-infected or mock-infected LJB cells. In total, 4.51 \u00d7 10 7 and 4.485 \u00d7 10 7 clean reads were generated from the control group and RGNNV-infected group, and 39,954 unigenes were annotated by six databases. And the number of unigenes was slightly different from previous reports in which the fish were infected with different pathogens (Lu et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2016) . to escape the antiviral response, including counteracting the activity of ISG15 (Guerra, C\u00e1ceres, Knobeloch, Horak, & Esteban, 2008; Yuan & Krug, 2001) . Several studies have addressed NNV persistent infections in many fish, indicating NNV has developed some mechanisms to antagonize host innate antiviral responses (Lu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) . We speculated that RGNNV might counteract the antiviral activity of ISG15 to escape the host antiviral response in LJB cells. Zinc finger protein 395 (ZNF395) is one of the most downregulated genes (decreased by 18.11 times) in this study. ZNF395, as a novel hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, contributes to the maximal stimulation of a subset of ISGs, such as ISG15, IFIT1/ISG56, IFI44, CXCL10 and CXCL11 (Schroeder, Herwartz, Jordanovski, & Steger, 2017) . In this study, in line with the down-regulation of ISG15, the expression of ZNF395 was also decreased. Given these results, it is possible that the declining level of ZNF395 may impair host antiviral responses by reducing the expression of ISGs involved in the innate immune response during RGNNV infection. It was known that ZNF395-mediated activation of ISGs was depended on IKK signalling (Jordanovski et al., 2013) . In present work, the expression levels of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, the catalytic subunits of IKK, were also repressed post-RGNNV infection. Further experiments would be necessary to determine the association of ISG15, ZNF395 and IKK signalling in sea perch. In addition, among these DEGs, HSPB1, also named HSP27, was down-regulated, similar to our previous study . HSPB1 has been reported to be widely involved in pathophysiology of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Overexpression of HSPB1 protected cells from oxidative damage and apoptosis triggered by Cd exposure (Mun\u014dz-Fontela, 2005) . In our previous study, overexpression of LjHSP27 inhibited RGNNV-induced apoptosis, supporting the vital role of HSP27 as an anti-apoptosis protein . It has been known that many DNA and RNA viruses can trigger oxidative stress and induce host cell death in infected cells (Casavant et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2015) .

A significant negative correlation was also found between Mdm2 and Ljp53 in this study. Thus, we speculated that RGNNV might repress the expression of Ljp53 by activating Mdm2 during RGNNV infection. As Mdm2 has been initially identified as a required host factor for viral replication(Raja et al., 2017), we cannot exclude an ambivalent role of Mdm2 during infection, as a result of its multiple functions and interactions with other host factors.In contrast, there was a positive correlation between Mdm4 and Ljp53. Previous study reported that Mdm2 targeted Mdm4 for proteasomal degradation in response to DNA damage(Kawai et al., 2003).
