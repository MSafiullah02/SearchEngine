            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is highly transmissible via the respiratory route and is associated with significant mortality, has been attributed to pulmonary infection with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003). Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses with genomes of \u223c30 kb in size (Enjuanes et al., 2001). Sequencing of its genome shows that SARS-CoV expresses the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003). S-proteins are expressed on the surface of CoVs to mediate virus\u2013host cell interactions leading to host cell infection (Cavanagh et al., 1986; Luo et al., 1999; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). An important property of S-protein is the high degree of glycosylation (Cavanagh, 1995). Whether and how the carbohydrate structures on S-proteins benefit the virus are unclear. Lectins that recognize microbial carbohydrate structures and target microbes for destruction and clearance (Weis et al., 1998), form an important arm of host innate immunity and it is possible that the highly glycosylated S-protein is recognized by such lectins.",

            "text": "The collectins are multimeric molecules assembled from identical or similar polypeptides and are a group of host lectins that recognize a wide range of microbial pathogens (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003). Each collectin polypeptide is composed of a middle collagen-like region flanked by an N-terminal cycteine-rich segment and an \u03b1-helical neck region that links the C-terminal Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain to the collagen-like region (CRD) (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003). Three polypeptides form a collagen-like triple helix in the middle of the molecule and the neck region bundles the C-terminal CRDs into clusters of three. These trimeric structures are further assembled through disulfide formation at the N-terminal segments to form the different collectin molecules (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003). Thus assembled collectin molecules display clustered CRDs at the periphery which, as shown by electron microscopy, can afford dimensions and flexibility to achieve multivalent binding to sugar residues on microbial pathogens (Voss et al., 1988; Lu et al., 1990, Lu et al., 1993, Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 1995, Holmskov et al., 2003). Three collectins are well-characterized in man, i.e. mannan-binding lectin (MBL), surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) (Lawson and Reid, 2000; Crouch and Wright, 2001; Jack et al., 2001). MBL is found predominantly in the blood circulation whereas SP-A and SP-D are expressed mainly in the lung at the alveolar surface associated with the surfactant monolayer (Lawson and Reid, 2000; Crouch and Wright, 2001; Jack et al., 2001). SP-A and SP-D are also found in extra-pulmonary tissues (Lu, 1997; Madsen et al., 2000).",

MBL-deficiency leads to poor complement activation and defective microbial opsonization for phagocytosis during childhood (Super et al., 1989). MBL\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit higher mortality compared with wild type mice upon Staphylococcus aureus challenge (Shi et al., 2004). Compared with wild type mice, SP-A\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit decreased killing of B. streptococcus and Haemophilus influenzae, display elevated lung inflammation as well as decreased oxidant production and macrophage phagocytosis (LeVine et al., 2000). SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased lung inflammation and oxidant production but decreased macrophage phagocytosis (LeVine et al., 2000). Deficiency in either SP-A or SP-D expression leads to increased inflammation and reduced pathogen uptake by alveolar macrophages. The latter is consistent with that both pulmonary collectins and the serum collectin MBL promote pathogen uptake by macrophages (LeVine et al., 2000; Kudo et al., 2004). In the present study, we investigated whether the lung collectins are able to recognize the SARS-CoV S-protein.",

The purified S-protein migrated as a protein of \u223c200 kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and was recognized by an anti-myc antibody (Fig. 2\n). The size of the purified S-protein under reducing conditions is consistent with that reported in a previous study (Li et al., 2003). However, it is much larger than the predicted molecular mass of \u223c130 kDa (1194 residues). Like other coronavirus S-proteins, the SARS-CoV S-protein is also characterized by a large number of potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites, i.e. 18 sites on the surface domain (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003). As shown in Fig. 2B, Asn-linked glycosylation contributes substantially to the observed increase in molecular mass of S-protein. Expression of S-protein in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of Asn-linked glycosylation, blocked the secretion of S-protein to the culture media; S-protein could not be isolated from the media of these cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2). However, when the cell lysate was examined by Western blotting, S-protein was detected in these tunicamycin-treated cells as a protein of \u223c130 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 4). In contrast, S-protein detected in the lysate of transfected 293T cells, which were not treated with tunicamycin, remained \u223c200 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 3). This indicated that the reduction in the size of S-protein in the tunicamycin-treated cells was due to loss of Asn-linked glycosylation which also prevented its functional maturation and secretion.",

The heavily glycosylated nature of the SARS-CoV S-protein prompted us to examine whether it is recognized by these host lectins. The lung alveoli represent the primary host interface with SARS-CoV. Two important arms of host innate immunity are present at the air\u2013epithelial interface of lung alveoli, i.e. the lung surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-D) and alveolar macrophages. Hence, the interaction between S-protein and SP-D was investigated. SP-D selectively recognizes maltose and mannose residues on microbes but shows little affinity for GlcNAc (Lu et al., 1992). Purified S-protein was immobilized on 96-well plates and incubated with human SP-D. Bound SP-D was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-SP-D antibody or a rabbit polyclonal anti-SP-D antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A\n, SP-D was shown to bind to immobilized S-protein in a dose-dependent manner. Binding was detectable at \u223c150 ng/ml SP-D and approached saturation at 625 ng/ml SP-D. The binding was completely blocked in the presence of 10 mM EDTA implying that the CRDs of SP-D, which require Ca2+ to bind to selected sugar ligands, was involved (Fig. 4A).",

At concentrations between 1.5 and 6.25 mM, maltose showed dose-dependent inhibition of SP-D binding to S-protein. Therefore, binding of SP-D to S-protein clearly involves the SP-D CRDs and the carbohydrate structures on S-protein. Although the purified S-protein contains the SP-D \u2018neck\u2019 sequence and the myc and His tag sequences, there are no potential glycosylation sites on these sequences. The carbohydrate-dependent SP-D binding to S-protein rules out SP-D recognition of these regions. Inhibition by other sugars was also examined. As shown in Fig. 4C, SP-D binding to S-protein was inhibited by mannose as well as maltose. However, it was not significantly inhibited by galactose and GlcNAc. These results further confirm the involvement of SP-D lectin activity in S-protein binding.",

Interestingly, ACE2 was detected on macrophages but not on DCs (Fig. 5A\n). We then examined S-protein binding to macrophages and DCs. As shown in Fig. 5B, S-protein could bind to macrophages. Although ACE2 was not detected on DCs, S-protein was also shown to bind to DCs with a distinct pattern from macrophages (Fig. 5B). This could involve other DC receptors (Jeffers et al., 2004; Marzi et al., 2004). Pre-incubation of S-protein with SP-D did not inhibit S-protein binding to macrophages indicating that the carbohydrate structures on S-protein are probably not involved in the observed S-protein binding to macrophages. SP-D showed no enhancement of S-protein binding to macrophages. SP-D also showed no inhibition or enhancement to S-protein binding to Vero cells (Fig. 3B, right panel). However, pre-incubation of S-protein with SP-D increased S-protein binding to DCs. These findings reveal that S-protein binds to macrophages and DCs by distinct mechanisms.",

The production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), a major pro-inflammatory cytokine which is intracellularly retained in the presence of brefeldin A, was examined by flow cytometry. As a positive control, these cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As shown in Fig. 5C, macrophages showed TNF-\u03b1 production upon stimulation with S-protein as well as LPS showing that macrophages were activated by S-protein. DCs were also effectively activated by LPS as shown by the induction of TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 5C), but were not activated by S-protein. It is not clear whether S-protein activates macrophages through ACE2, which is expressed on macrophages but not on DCs. Cytokine production by DCs and macrophages, upon S-protein stimulation, was also examined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6\n, while S-protein was consistently a weaker stimulus than LPS, it induced IL-6, IL-8 as well as TNF-\u03b1 from macrophages. However, it did not induce significant cytokines from DCs. This is seemingly in contrast with the reported cytokine induction from DCs by live SARS-CoV virus (Law et al., 2005). However, it should be noted that live SARS-CoV are a more complex stimulus which could activate more complex signaling than S-protein in these cells. Nonetheless, the ability of S-protein to activate macrophages may contribute to the pathology of SARS through excessive pulmonary inflammation.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV infects human hosts through the respiratory system and its interplay with the host innate immune system in the lung alveoli is likely to exert a major influence on the outcome of SARS-CoV infection. At the air\u2013epithelial interfaces of lung alveoli, a surfactant monolayer is present. A primary function of the surfactant is to reduce surface tension at the end of expiration to prevent the collapse of the lung alveoli (Hawgood and Clements, 1990). It is also known that the surfactant contains two collectin molecules, i.e. SP-A and SP-D, which recognize carbohydrate structures on a wide range of microbial pathogens leading to killing and clearance of these microbes (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003). Coronaviruses infect host cells through the highly glycosylated surface S-proteins. We therefore decided to investigate whether and how the carbohydrate structures on S-protein may interact with these surfactant collectins. To preserve the natural carbohydrate moiety on S-protein, it was expressed in eukaryotic cells. S-protein was expressed without the transmembrane and internal domains to permit its secretion into the medium and allow its purification as a soluble probe. To express S-protein as a trimer, its C-terminus was fused with the \u2018neck\u2019 sequence of SP-D, which is known to form strong triple coiled-coils and to cluster associated structures into parallel trimers. This strategy was initially to reflect the multiplicity of S-protein on the virus but a recent report showed that SARS-CoV S-protein in fact forms trimers naturally (Li et al., 2006).",

Our results suggested that these potential glycosylation sites are probably mostly occupied as the purified S-protein exhibited a molecular mass of \u223c200 kDa which is \u223c70 kDa larger than that expected from its amino acid sequence (1194 residues or \u223c130 kDa). Blocking of Asn-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin reduced S-protein to 130 kDa and completely prevented its secretion into the medium. This implies that glycosylation contributed to approx. one-third of the molecular mass of the purified S-protein and SARS-CoV replication requires proper S-protein glycosylation. The carbohydrate structures on S-protein might therefore represent a unique class of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000). Carbohydrate structures on many microorganisms are PAMPs that are recognized by host C-type lectins, including collectins (Sastry and Ezekowitz, 1993).",

            "text": "In the present study, we demonstrated that the pulmonary surfactant-associated collectin SP-D could bind to the SARS-CoV S-protein. The effective inhibition of SP-D-binding to S-protein by EDTA and sugars such as maltose and mannose suggest that SP-D binds to the carbohydrate moieties on S-protein. We similarly examined whether S-protein was recognized by SP-A, another surfactant-associated collectin. Due to the low level of binding detected, we were unable to conclude whether S-protein is also recognized by SP-A (data not shown). We showed that the serum collectin, MBL, was unable to recognize S-protein. One possible explanation for the apparently selective recognition of S-protein by SP-D may be that S-proteins display sugar residues that are preferentially recognized by SP-D. These two collectins exhibit different sugar specificity. For example, SP-D shows little affinity for GlcNAc to which MBL binds effectively (Lu et al., 1992; Holmskov et al., 2003). The disparities between SP-D and most other collectins in overall dimensions may also contribute to their differences in carbohydrate recognition. SP-D has long collagen-like helices which enable its CRDs to extend more than 90 nm apart whereas SP-A and MBL have much shorter collagen helices which can only extend their CRDs maximally less than 30 nm apart (Lu, 1997; Holmskov et al., 2003). C-type lectins, including collectins, mainly recognize specific sugar residues that are terminally presented and non-reducing (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003). While such sugar residues are common on extracellular microbial pathogens, viral glycoproteins are synthesized using the host eukaryotic cell machinery and most peripheral sugar residues are expected to be modified by terminal sialic acid residues. Therefore, despite the high degree of glycosylation of S-protein, suitable terminal sugar residues that are recognized by CRDs are probably infrequent and scattered. The much extended dimensions of SP-D, compared with MBL and SP-A, may enable it to bind to these scattered sugar residues more efficiently.",

Macrophages play essential roles in the onset and control of inflammation. S-protein is a major surface protein on SARS-CoV and we showed that S-protein binding to macrophages could activate the production of TNF-\u03b1 from these cells. The observed macrophage activation by S-protein was not due to contamination of purified S-protein with microbial endotoxins since the purified S-protein showed no activation of TLR2 and TLR4 as judged using luciferase assays for NF-\u03baB activation (data not shown) (Chen et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2005). The purified S-protein showed no activation of DCs, also suggesting that the observed macrophage activation by purified S-protein is not due to contaminating microbial endotoxins as these microbial structures would also activate DCs. It is unclear how S-protein selectively activates macrophages but not DCs although it binds to both cell types. This may be attributed to the involvement of different receptors on the surface of these cells. For example, ACE2 is expressed on macrophages but not on DCs. However, soluble ACE2 was not available to verify whether this receptor was involved in the observed S-protein activation of macrophages.",
