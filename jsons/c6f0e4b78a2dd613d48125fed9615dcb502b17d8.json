Firstly, a rumor propagation model with two language spreaders, in which the immunologic mechanism is considered in the ignorant, is proposed on heterogeneous networks. Secondly, the basic reproduction number and the dynamic behaviors are analyzed by using the next-generation matrix method and Lyapunov stability theory, respectively. Moreover, two control strategies are designed to effectively suppress the spread of the rumor. The one is continuous control strategy. By applying real-time control to the spreaders, the rumor spreading time can be greatly reduced and the rumor can die out in a short time. The other is event-triggered impulsive control strategy, which can effectively reduce the consumption of resources and ensure the extinction of the rumor. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis and the feasibility of control methods are verified by numerical simulations.",

With the rapid development of Internet information technology, rumor propagation is no longer limited to word of mouth, but relies on the new media of the Internet, such as BBS, SMS, Microblog, QQ, WeChat, Twitter and other social network platforms. For the past few years, a number of emergencies caused by rumors have erupted in China, which have brought huge economic losses to the country and seriously disturbed people's life order. For example, in 2003, the rumor that banlangen could cure SARS caused residents in many cities around the country to frantically buy up banlangen, which caused a great social panic. In the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan, the rumor that iodized salt could protect against radiation caused the run on salt. These rumors seriously destroyed the social order and caused social panic. With the advent of information dissemination, there are more and more emergencies caused by rumors. Therefore, it is very significant to study and master the law of rumor propagation in the new era, which can help the government department to prevent and control rumors.",

            "text": "Since the form of rumor transmission is similar to disease transmission, based on the disease transmission model, the rumor propagation model is established. In the basic rumor propagation model, the population is divided into three categories: Ignorants (people who do not know the rumors), Spreaders (people who know and spread rumors) and Removers (people who know rumors but do not spread them). Early studies on rumor propagation took the classical Daley-Kendall (DK) model in [1, 2] and Maki-Thomson (MT) model in [3] as examples, which were applicable for the phenomenon of rumor propagation in small-scale social networks with direct contact. In the DK model, the authors assumed that the rumor was spread through the contact of rumor spreaders with other groups in the population. Maki and Thomson [3] modified the DK model and proposed that rumors were spread through two-way contact between the rumormongers and other people in the crowd, thus deriving the MT model.",

            "text": "In large-scale social networks, the probability of rumors spreading among individuals is diverse, and the dynamic behaviors of rumors spreading are also varied. Therefore, the study of rumors spreading mainly explores the laws between them. Zanette [4] was the first one to apply the theory of complex networks to analyze the rumor propagation, and then he studied the MT model with small-world network under dynamic and static conditions in [5] , in which he found that the network structure would have a momentous impact on rumor propagation. Moreno [6] studied the rumor propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, respectively, and gave the mean field equation of rumor propagation in homogeneous and scale-free networks. Later, there are an increasing number of scholars [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] to study the rumor spreading issues in complex networks. Kawach [12] pointed out that the memory mechanism of the stifler would affect the spread of rumors and change the spread rate in the process of spreading. Zhao [13] studied the rumor propagation model with forgetting and memory mechanisms. The rumor propagation models with rational consciousness [14] , psychological differences [15, 16] , media reports [17] , official refutation [18] and other factors were also considered. In addition, since individuals may not respond to rumors in time, [19, 20] studied the rumor propagation models with contact lag between susceptible and infected people. Since various individuals have distinct abilities to spread and absorb information, it is of greater practical significance to study the rumor propagation model [21] [22] [23] [24] under heterogeneous networks. In [25] , a rumor propagation model based on heterogeneous network was proposed, and two control strategies not only show a good resistance to rumor propagation, but also can effectively reduce the cost of suppressing rumor. In [26] , based on a scale-free network, the authors considered the network topology with psychological factors and applied such control strategies as unified immune control, modular surface control and optimal immune control to inhibit the spread of rumors.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 9 , if we choose \u03b1(k i ) = 0.7, \u03c1(k i ) = 0.195, \u03b3 = 0.05, \u03b2 1 = 0.001, \u03b2 2 = 0.02, p = 0.01, d = 0.01, \u03bc = 0.005, the rumor Spreaders 1 and Spreaders 2 exist continuously. In order to effectively suppress the spread of rumor, we use continuous control mechanism to control the rumor. Based on Theorem 6, we obtain that the rumor will disappear when we choose \u03c4 \u2265 0.12. Choosing k 1 = 1 and k i \u2208 [1, 50] , the simulation results are shown in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively. In addition, when we choose \u03b1(k i ) = 0.6 + 0.002k, (1), if we choose \u03b1(k i ) = 0.5, \u03c1(k i ) = 0.45, \u03b3 = 0.001, \u03b2 1 = 0.008, \u03b2 2 = 0.008, p = 0.01, d = 0.01, \u03bc = 0.002, by simple calculation, it is derived that r 01 > 1 and r 02 > 1. As Fig. 13 shows, the rumor will persist continuously. In order to suppress rumor propagation, the event-triggered impulsive control scheme is applied. The event-trigger function is defined as g(t) = e(t) 2 \u2212 \u03c2 2 X (t k ) 2 \u2212 \u03c3 (t\u2212t 0 ) 2 , where \u03c2 = 5, \u03c3 = 1. If we select = 0.5, q = 0.13, Theorem 8 is satisfied. The state trajectories are shown in Fig. 14 , in which the rumor finally dies out by using the event-triggered impulsive control. The trigger signal is shown in Fig. 15 , in which 1 means triggered and 0 means not triggered. The simulation shows that the rumor will die out when we control the rumor spreaders at some discrete instants. Compared with continuous, this control scheme is more practical. Remark 8 In order to analyze the correctness of the theorems, three cases for model (1) with different parameters are simulated. In each case, the simulation results verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. When the rumor spreaders continuously exist, we propose two kinds of control schemes to suppress the spreading of the rumor. Figures 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 show that the control methods are effective. In fact, the eventtriggered impulsive control reflects that we only need to decrease the rumor spreaders at some discrete instants. This method is more resource-efficient and practical.",
