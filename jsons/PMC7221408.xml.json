Perhaps as a consequence of these efforts, and in part due to social anxiety regarding infection and contact with healthcare providers,3 there are likely to be a number of unforeseeable epidemiologic aftereffects. As people accommodate to social distancing recommendations by public health and government officials, avoid healthcare institutions and clinics\u2014or resort to (sometimes limited) telemedical evaluations, we will likely observe a shift in the epidemiology of stroke and other medical conditions.4 Milder symptoms of an acute cerebrovascular event\u2014which could have historically prompted patients to seek medical attention, receive acute treatment and aggressive secondary stroke prevention\u2014may now be minimized to the point that these patients will not present to the emergency room or notify their primary care physician. Because of this psychosocial consequence of a pandemic, it is possible that the reported incidence rate of acute ischemic stroke may decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the reported incidence rate of more severe cerebrovascular events (e.g., strokes due to large vessel occlusion) will remain stable, as these severe symptoms cannot be ignored by patients or family members.",

CUH is a 574-bed, tertiary care, Comprehensive Stroke Center in southern New Jersey that serves as a referral base for 5 Primary Stroke Centers in the region, for whom CUH offers formal telestroke services. Acute ischemic stroke was diagnosed clinically by a vascular neurologist as long as symptom onset occurred in the preceding two weeks (or onset was unknown), or if there was radiographic evidence of acute infarction on unenhanced computed tomography (CT) or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI). Patients were compared between two treatment periods: (1) pre-COVID-19, which included patients admitted on dates between October 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020; and (2) COVID-19, which included patients admitted on dates between March 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020. March 1, 2020 was selected as the start date of the COVID-19 period as it was the date of the first New Jersey resident to develop COVID-19 symptoms, with serologic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. (By March 20, 2020, the state of New Jersey was placed into lockdown by government authorities, however social distancing had become encouraged long before this.) To be included in this observational cohort, all patients underwent a non-contrast head CT to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage or other structural brain lesions that could explain the patient's neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not required.",

Secondary outcomes included stroke severity (according to NIHSS and the number and proportion of patients diagnosed with an acute LVO), the distribution of stroke etiologies, time from evaluation to imaging and treatment, use of MRI, length of hospital stay, and discharge disposition. Linear regression was used to estimate the association between the COVID-19 period and length of hospital stay, while logistic regression was used to estimate the association between the COVID-19 period and categorical outcome variables. These models were adjusted for age, baseline NIHSS, and presence of LVO. An adjusted logistic regression model was also used to estimate the odds of LVO during the COVID-19 period, adjusting for age and NIHSS. For the secondary outcome of in-hospital mortality, logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of this outcome based on the COVID-19 period, and this was adjusted for age, NIHSS, and LVO. \u201cTransition to comfort measures\u201d was deliberately excluded from this model as it perfectly predicted in-hospital mortality and hospice care.

The small sample size raises the possibility of type I error. It is possible that more severe neurologic deficits, as captured by the NIHSS, may be more common among patients with stroke in the era of COVID-19. However, our single-center experience and preliminary results may be underpowered to detect these and other significant differences. It would have been more appropriate to compare identical periods in 2019 (e.g., 3/1/2019 \u2013 4/15/2019) to the COVID-19 period in 2020, however we chose the immediately preceding months as the \u2018control\u2019 period due to a more than doubled staffing of vascular neurologists and growing telestroke referral base by mid-2019. By the fall of 2019, we had already witnessed an increase in our center's acute stroke volume, therefore comparing identical weeks in 2019 and 2020 may have falsely underestimated the anticipated stroke rate from 3/1/2020 \u2013 4/15/2020. Selecting March 1, 2020 as the start date of the COVID-19 period was also somewhat arbitrary. However, it was selected based on emerging public health data that month, and allowed for data to be analyzed by month as well as by day. A post hoc analysis of data stratified by March 20, 2020 was also performed with similar results as shown in Tables 1 and 2, with notable exceptions being a loss of significance in the difference of new stroke diagnoses between periods. That said, higher NIHSS and the presence of LVO remained more common among patients admitted after 3/20/2020 (median NIHSS 9 vs. 5, p=0.06; 46% LVO vs. 22%, p<0.01). Due to the early release of these results, we also lack long-term outcome data regarding functional disability and readmission rates\u2014which may be higher during the COVID-19 period due to a higher proportion of discharges to home.

In this prospective observational cohort, we observed a significant decline in the number of new acute stroke diagnoses at our tertiary care, Comprehensive Stroke Center in southern New Jersey. New Jersey is second only to New York as the state with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases31\u2014with more than 85,000 cases as of April 20, 2020\u2014therefore our results may not be presently generalizable to institutions where SARS-CoV-2 is ubiquitous. However, these findings may be quickly observed at other institutions as more and more cases of COVID-19 are diagnosed and patients learn to avoid hospital systems. Unsurprisingly, the number of patients with LVO did not appreciably change during the COVID-19 period when compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This supports our hypothesis that patients with milder symptoms may be intentionally avoidant of seeking treatment at healthcare facilities. This effect may manifest both in the number of calls to emergency medical services, and in the number of patients who present to the ED via private vehicles. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this study is the first to confirm anecdotal reports7 that stroke admission rates may decline because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Additionally, with the focus of our healthcare system shifted towards identifying patients with SARS-CoV-2 and preserving healthcare resources, patients with mild stroke symptoms will possibly be discharged prematurely without a complete stroke evaluation or a secondary stroke prevention strategy. Furthermore, the utilization of DWI-MRI is decreasing, therefore patients have to have more severe focal neurological deficits to be diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke, when head CT is the sole imaging modality being used. Consequently, this has the potential to impact estimates of stroke-related disability. Larger studies representing multiple populations are underway and may better elucidate the clinical implications of missed stroke diagnoses and other social consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",
