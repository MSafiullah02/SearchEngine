IB causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry because it causes poor weight gain and feed efficiency in broilers and suboptimal egg production and egg quality in laying birds. In addition, high mortality (<30%) sometimes occurs in young chickens due to kidney manifestations of some nephropathogenic strains. The disease process is often complicated by secondary bacterial infections that cause increased mortality of birds and condemnation at processing [1], [2].",

Cross-protection tends to decrease as the degree of amino acid identity between the spike (S) glycoprotein S1 subunit of two IBV strains decreases [3]. However, some strains occasionally confer broad protection against many heterologous serotypes. The concept of protectotypes [4] has been suggested as a valuable method that should be considered during the development of strategies to control IBV infections, and strains possessing cross-protective ability are generally considered to be useful vaccine candidates. To date, the Massachusetts (Mass) and 4/91 strains have been primarily used as live vaccines due to their epizootic distributions and cross-protective ability [2], [5].",

More recently, the QX-like nephropathogenic strain [9] appears to have become widespread in China [10], Korea [11], Russia [12], and many countries in Europe [13], [14], where flocks are commonly vaccinated with Mass or 4/91 vaccines.

These results were identical with previous classification of Korean IBV isolates [15] and suggested that tissue tropism of IBV correlated with genotype based on the S gene sequence. However, Korean group II was subsequently divided into two separate subgroups identified as KM91-like subgroup and QX-like subgroup. The IBV isolates detected in the 1990s to the early 2000s in Korea belonged to the KM91-like subgroup containing the K2parent, while IBV isolates obtained after 2003 belonged to the QX-like subgroup that included the QX strain, which is a representative Chinese strain related to nephritis [10].

In fact, long-term passage in embryonated eggs is necessary to reduce the virulence of IBV, and most commercially available IBV vaccines (e.g., H52, H120, 4/91 and GA98) are produced by more than 50 serial passages [5], [21]. In a previous study, the 120th passage virus of the Mass serotype (the H120 strain) did not induce any mortality in day-old chicks [5]. However, in this study, 120th passage virus of the K2parent did not induce mortality in day-old chicks by intraocular administration, but still induced mortality (<30%) in day-old chicks after coarse spray administration (data not shown). Therefore, we found that nephropathogenic strains required additional egg passages when compared to Mass strains for complete attenuation. On the other hand, the 170th passage virus (K2p170) was considered to be completely attenuated because it was non-pathogenic to day-old chicks. To our knowledge, the K2p170 seems to be the most highly egg passaged strain commercial IBV vaccine strains in the world [5].",

[24] demonstrated that the S protein is a determinant of cell tropism of IBV, and it has been suggested that some amino acid residues contributed to attenuation of IBV [25], [26]. However, amino acid changes in the S protein of K2p170 were not identical to these substitutions, even though K2p170 undergo distinct alteration of biological features including restriction in the tracheas and lack of renal pathogenicity. In agreement with previous studies conducted to determine a region that leads to the pathogenic phenotype of IBV [15], [27], our findings suggest that the renal tropism and pathogenicity of K2p170 are not related to the S1 gene, but to other genes [28]. Further genetic investigation of K2p170, such as comparison of the entire genome of attenuated IBV strains with its parent strains [29], may provide a better understanding of the pathogenicity related to renal tropism of IBV.",

It is likely that some damage to the tracheal mucosa is necessary for the development of local immunity against IBV [21]. The level of damage was found to be comparable to that of commercial vaccines (H120 and Ma5), and was in agreement with recent studies conducted to determine the attenuation phenotypes of the GA98 serotype vaccine via evaluation of tracheal lesion scores following challenge [21]. Moreover, K2p170 caused limited damage to the respiratory tract and did not affect the growth performance of broilers, even after coarse spray. In addition, no virulence reversion of the K2p170 occurred in SPF chickens, as demonstrated by the absence of clinical signs and mild histological lesions following in vivo back passage. These findings suggest that K2p170 is useful for hatchery spray vaccination, which is a method of mass vaccination for IBV that is used worldwide [2]. On the basis of its safety in day-old chicks demonstrated, delivery of K2p170 in ovo can be further attempted as a novel vaccination route of choice for IB vaccines [30].",

In the present study, the K2p170 induced strong local immunity following replication in the trachea, as evidenced by the complete protection of the tracheas against the homologous K2parent strain. Despite restricted replication in the trachea, neutralizing antibodies to the K2p170 were induced (NI of K2p170 was 4.5), and K2p170 induced complete protection of the kidneys. These findings indicate that K2p170 is highly immunogenic. As seen in a previous study describing the genetic stability of Korean nephropathogenic strains sharing 96% homology of the S1 gene for 10 years [15], we observed only eight amino acid changes in the S1 protein of K2p170. Interestingly, most altered residues were located outside of the hypervariable region (HVR), which is associated with the neutralizing epitope [1]. Because the S1 protein has been identified as a major inducer of protective immune responses, our findings lead to the conclusion that the genetic stability of K2p170 contributes to maintenance of constant immunogenicity, even after prolonged passage in embryonated eggs.",

In efficacy studies, K2p170 provided almost complete protection against distinct QX-like subgroup strain of Korean group II (K1277/03) and significant protection against heterologous IBV strains belonged to Mass group (Mass41) and Korean group I (K107/04). It has been proposed that the use of a combination of two commercial vaccines, Mass and 4/91, could be partly effective against heterologous IBV strains, including QX-like strains [32]. However, the use of multiple strains of live vaccines should be practiced with caution due to concerns regarding the formation of variant viruses by recombination with field strains resulting from the spread of vaccine strains [33]. Conversely, the results presented here suggest that single administration of the K2p170 is markedly effective and economical due to its cross-protective ability. It will be important to determine the range of cross-protection conferred by K2p170 against other heterologous IBV strains.",
