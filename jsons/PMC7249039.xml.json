Children and adolescents living in isolation, in abusive homes, are in danger during this time of economic uncertainty and stress12.

Detection of viral nucleic acid takes place by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method inside authorized laboratories, with biological safety class 2. However, RT-qPCR kits can give some false-negative results, depending on swab sampling and extraction method, and on the possibility that virus, even if present in the individuals, is not detectable in nose\u2013pharynx mucous membrane16. Recently, some studies described a discrepancy between the diagnostic power of RT-qPCR and CT, the latter being more sensitive8. Incidence of false negatives at molecular tests sometimes force repetition of the same, up to three times in clinically suspected Covid-19 patients and/or with a Covid-19 CT scan pattern8. New, more user-friendly molecular tests are on the horizon for \u201cout of the Lab\u201d SARS-CoV-2 RNA screening, utilizing Heating Unextracted Diagnostic Samples Obliterate Nuclease and cards to run Clusters of Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) methods, as DNA Endonuclease Targeted CRISPRs Trans Reporter17. In this context, a great debate is ongoing about the role of serological assays able to detect IgG, IgA, or IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 in serum, plasma, or capillary blood, to have a clear picture of the outbreak size in each country, to assess the degree of immunization and to support the decision to re-admit people at work18. Several serological assays have been developed since the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), rapid antibody immunochromatographic tests, point-of-care test (POCT)-fluorescence assays, and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs)18. More than 120 different diagnostic kit brands have been proposed on the market, many are CE (European Community) approved; to date, very few are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved19,20. Serological tests to detect antibodies against viral antigens are not yet widely used during this pandemic, but rather in a \u201cleopard spot\u201d manner in publics and private laboratories; however, they could be as useful as they were during SARS epidemic of 200221 and some studies demonstrate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM presence in clinically confirmed cases with negative RT-qPCR results22. Serological tests are cheaper than molecular tests, require a shorter analytical time, and productivity can be much greater than molecular tests in case of automated instruments in medium-large hospital laboratories, employing CLIA and ELISA.",

            "text": "Serological tests for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection in patient\u2019s blood are currently important to: (a) trace contacts; (b) activate serological surveillance at the local, regional, and national level; and (c) identify those who have already had contact with virus23. Assuming there is protective immunity, serological information can be used to decide return at work of infected workers, especially people who work in environments in which they can potentially be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., health professionals). Unfortunately, majority of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) companies do not report nature of the antigen/s utilized in the assays and then it is difficult to understand whether antibodies detected with different kits and methodologies have a neutralizing effect on the virus, possibly through binding with the viral spike protein S subunits receptor-binding domain (RBD)24,25. In addition, serological tests can be used retrospectively in post-mortem diagnosis and, finally, they can be eventually used together with molecular tests for improving their diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, in the near future, serological tests could play a role in the efficacy evaluation of any identified vaccines26. Although IgM antibodies generation may occur as rapidly as the viral genetic material in the respiratory tract, generally the timing of immunoglobulin production (from 4 days after the onset of symptoms, to 10\u201314 days) limits its applicability in the acute phase diagnosis27,28. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that molecular tests represent an \u201cinstantaneous\u201d picture of possible virus presence, whereas serological tests display virus presence during a wider phase of the infectious process, whether or not it reaches a clinical relevance. Moreover, in particularly serious cases, the use of serological tests in titration of convalescent patients hyperimmune plasma cannot be excluded (once the antibodies ability to neutralize the virus has been established), after considering all possible side effects of this treatment29. About that, FDA is coordinating a national effort to develop blood-based antibody-rich Covid-19 therapies. Serological tests, through the study of humoral response profile and clinical observations, may also contribute to definition of IgG serum concentration suitable for a subject to be immune, as well as the persistence time of any immunization.",

At first, Card 1 was the only available method for serological screening of nurses, physicians, and other healthcare workers. The test was performed on about 1200 people, and to evaluate Card 1 serological specificity and sensitivity, we collected blood samples related to people analyzed by RT-qPCR, at least after 4 days from the execution of the nasopharyngeal swab. We selected 307 samples as follows: 82 with RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal-positive swabs (mean age 63.4 \u00b1 15.7 years) and 225 with RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal-negative swabs (mean age 54.5 \u00b1 19.5 years). On this cohort, specificity was 100% but sensitivity was lower: 53.6% and 76.9% for IgM and IgG, respectively. Although commercial manufacturers claim their tests have high sensitivity and specificity, many of them have not published \u201con field\u201d validation studies yet. Later on, with other tests becoming available, we decided to compare the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM detection sensitivity and specificity among different methods and kits: two immunochromatographic card tests (named Card 1 and Card 2; Fig. 1a), one immunofluorescence chromatographic card test (Card 3; Fig. 1b), and one chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay (CLIA). At this purpose, we collected 43 positive samples from Covid-19 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 63.1 \u00b1 13.0 years) and 40 control subjects, negative to nasopharyngeal swabs RT-qPCR (mean age 49.9 \u00b1 12.8 years).",

Moreover, viraemia does not appear to be a significant feature of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 and where viral RNA has been detected, this has been at a low level. Nevertheless, viraemia may be a feature in more severe Covid-19, although current data are conflicting. About that, however, it is strongly recommended to wear face masks, gloves, disposable coats, and protective glasses (mandatory safety set in Italian clinical laboratories). Regarding immunochromatographic cards, they are fully manual and the reading is subjective, whereas immunofluorescence cromatographic cards set up is manual but the reading is accomplished through a fluorescence detector. Traceability is complete in CLIA and in fluorescence assays; furthermore, both of them are able to send results directly to Laboratory Information System. We strongly suggest to revise the cut-off values reported on datasheets by companies, because sometimes they are calculated in a small number of subjects belonging to a specific ethnicity or region.

Nevertheless, different strategies can be chosen depending on the target: support to diagnosis with IgM, or serological screening and epidemiology studies with only IgG.

The flowchart shows two different paths as follows: in the first, there are subjects who have always been asymptomatic; in the second, there are patients who have overcome the disease. Serology is integrated with nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR swab when necessary, to exclude topical virus presence. It is true that there is no 100% guarantee of virus-free among the groups tested with serological and molecular assays, but in the flowchart we propose a 2-week preventive quarantine and a second serological IgG/IgM assay before re-admitting people at work. Taking into account that no test method is perfect and there are still a lot of unknown elements for this virus, social distancing should be kept for a longer time, especially before a valid vaccine or therapy are established. In fact, it will be still highly suggested that people finally labeled as \u201creturn to work,\u201d should continue to use personal protections such as face mask, frequent hand-washing, and keeping necessary physical distances with each other. The median day of serum conversion for both IgG and IgM has been calculated 13 days after symptom onset27,40, so the preventive security measures, together with the double IgG and IgM serological testing (one at the beginning of the quarantine and one after 2 weeks), can be helpful for recovery of activities in less time and in safety. Obviously, the span of natural immunization is still unknown and will be determined in the future, through clinical and serological follow-up; for this reason, we prudently suggest a time of 3 months for testing IgG-positive subjects, considering a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic duration of at least 6 months (reported during 2002 SARS epidemic)41.",
