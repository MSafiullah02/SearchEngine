As a result, organizations are rapidly expanding utilization of video conferencing platforms, telehealth, and other tools to deliver remote care and abide by social distancing measures.",

For one, patients who can be safely monitored remotely may be given the option for a remote-visit if possible. Secondly, facilities have to redirect resources and staff to attend to a surge of acute cases associated with COVID-19 which may limit the capacity to deliver elective procedures involved in clinical research. Third, non-essential staff, including clinical research staff are increasingly being required to work remotely in order to reduce exposure risk.",

Travel remains a major burden associated with cancer clinical trials participation [3] , and may contribute to disparities in whom they serve [4] , and may be amplified in patients who live in rural areas [5] . Efforts to address this potential barrier to participation have largely focused on addressing indirect costs, such as lodging and gas [6, 7] . However, there is also an urgent need to re-consider the need for high frequency in-person safety monitoring. The level of safety monitoring that is considered \"good practice\" may be unnecessary for certain investigational therapeutics or a subset of low risk clinical trial participants [8] . Uren and colleagues observed that remote monitoring for complex phase III clinical trials was feasible and led to an overall cost saving for the sponsor and reduced burden on facility resources [9] . Importantly, reducing intensity of in-person visits for cancer clinical trials may help promote equity in recruitment and improved access. COVID-19 is forcing our hand. It is demanding research institutions to undertake care of patients on clinical trials remotely, when possible. It is pointing out that in some cases, we place undue, and unnecessary burdens on our patients if they wish to avail themselves of clinical trials. And it suggests that in the right circumstances, less may be more. This challenging time in our history may permanently inform the way we think about and design therapeutic cancer clinical trials in order to make them more patient-centered and inclusive.",
