What factors precipitated their emergence? Why did they emerge at this time? What are the spillover mechanisms? What is their geographic occurrence? What are the potential impacts on humans and domestic species? The more recent description of Nipah virus-attributed disease in humans in Bangladesh reinforces the need for a comprehensive understanding of the ecology and, more broadly, epidemiology of these agents. This chapter describes the emergence of Hendra and Nipah viruses and the search for their natural hosts, discusses the impacts of emergence, and suggests factors putatively associated with emergence.",

She was observed to be ill on September 7, 1994 and moved to the Hendra training facility for intensive care, but died 2 days later. Over the following 14 days, 12 of 23 thoroughbreds in the facility and a neighbouring stable became ill and died acutely or were euthanised terminally ( Fig. 2 ) (Murray et al. 1995a) . Clinical signs included fever, facial swelling, severe respiratory distress, ataxia, and terminally, copious frothy (sometimes blood-tinged) nasal discharge. There were four non-fatal cases, two of which retained mild neurological signs. A further three horses in the stable were subsequently found to have seroconverted without apparent clinical signs.

Two horses were infected on the Mackay property, both fatally Rogers et al. 1996) . The first horse, a 10-year-old heavily pregnant thoroughbred mare died on August 1, 1994 after exhibiting severe respiratory distress, ataxia, and marked swelling of the cheeks and supraorbital fossa over a 24-h period. The second horse, a two-year-old colt in an adjoining paddock was reported to have licked the muzzle of the dead mare. The colt died 11 days later, again after a 24-h clinical course, during which he exhibited aimless pacing, muscle trembling and haemorrhagic nasal discharge (Allworth et al. 1995) . Serological studies were an integral part of the outbreak investigations of the Brisbane and Mackay incidents. No evidence of Hendra virus infection was found in 800 domestic animals surveyed on the case properties or on incontact properties. They included 387 horses, 287 cattle, goats and pigs, 23 dogs, 64 cats, and 39 poultry Rogers et al. 1996) . Particular effort was directed towards surveying the broader horse population in the state of Queensland, with a further 2,024 horses from 166 properties sampled in a structured survey (Ward et al. 1996) . With the exception of the seven horses that survived infection in the Hendra outbreak, none of the surveyed domestic animals showed serological evidence of exposure to Hendra virus. The negative surveillance findings (based on a highly sensitive serum neutralisation test) provided a high level of confidence that Hendra virus was not being sustained by in-contact domestic animal transmission, was not established in the Queensland horse population, and that the outbreak was unlikely to have originated from domestic species. Because of the temporal clustering of the Mackay and Brisbane incidents, efforts were made to identify possible links between the two properties. These investigations, undertaken in late 1995, and focused primarily on horse movements, personnel movements, and management practices, found no evidence to directly link the two outbreaks.",

            "text": "The first reported outbreak (13 cases, nine fatal) was in Meherpur in April-May 2001. The index case, a 33-year-old farmer, developed symptoms on April 20, and died 6 days later. Four other persons in the same household became cases 10-18 days after the index case. A further four of the cases were relatives of the index case. The second reported outbreak of 12 cases (eight fatal) occurred in Naogaon in January 2003. The index case was a 12-yearold boy. Cases occurred in eight households. A cluster of cases occurred in one household after the head of the household became ill and later died. Two weeks later, his wife and his three eldest daughters became ill; his wife and one daughter died. In both the Meherpur and Naogaon outbreaks, handling or exposure to patient secretions was a risk factor for illness (Hsu et al. 2004 ). The third reported outbreak occurred simultaneously in Goalanda (Rajbari district) and seven other districts between January and February 2004. A total of 29 cases were reported, of whom 22 died. There was a predominance of young boys in the Goalanda cluster, suggesting that a specific activity (such as climbing trees or ingesting fruits contaminated with the secretions of infected bats) may have led to exposure (Anonymous 2004a) . The fourth reported outbreak occurred in the Faridpur district in April 2004. Of 36 identified cases, 27 were fatal. This outbreak differed from previous outbreaks in two important ways. Firstly, at least six patients developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome, in contrast to the previously observed predominant fever/neurological presentation; and secondly, the epidemiological evidence clearly indicated that person-to-person spread (possibly through large droplet transmission) was the primary mode of transmission. A fifth reported outbreak (12 cases, 11 fatal) was reported in January 2005, in the northern district of Tangail. Cases predominantly exhibited fever and neurological symptoms. Drinking raw date palm juice was the only surveyed exposure significantly associated with illness. Bats reportedly frequently drink from the open pots into which dripping juice is collected overnight, and bat excrement is reportedly common on or in the pots (Anonymous 2005b) .",

            "text": "The pattern of the Bangladesh outbreaks suggests a sporadic, geographically scattered introduction of infection to humans. Nucleotide sequence data also supports a different epidemiology in Bangladesh. Overall, the nucleotide sequences of the genomes of the Nipah viruses isolated in Bangladesh in 2004 and in Malaysia in 1999 share 92% identity. While the size and distribution of the open reading frames and the sequences of key regulatory elements are conserved, the amount of genetic diversity present in sequences obtained in Malaysia and Bangladesh varies (Harcourt et al. 2005) . Those obtained from human cases in Malaysia suggest a single source of human infection from the porcine amplifying host (AbuBakar et al. 2004; Chan et al. 2001; Chua et al. 2000) ; those from Bangladesh cases formed a cluster clearly distinct from the Malaysian sequences, but differed from each other by approximately 0.8%, suggesting possible multiple introductions of virus into humans. As yet, sequence data are unavailable from virus isolates obtained from putative person-to-person transmission chains to suggest genetic changes potentially associated with adaptation to the novel human host. Sequence changes in SARS coronavirus isolated from palm civets and from humans suggest active selection of novel genotypes, including genotypes potentially adapted to a novel human reservoir host Song et al. 2005) . Such genetic adaptation is a significant transition point in the evolution of specific human pathogens by which agents can emerge as pandemic threats, such as HIV and influenza A subtypes (see the chapter by Childs et al., this volume; Childs 2004 ).",

Zoonotic infections of horses were previously unknown, yet it quickly became evident that the infection and consequent death of the trainer was attributable to his close contact with the index horse case. When the aetiological agent was established as a novel virus of the family Paramyxoviridae , the search for its origin began. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the virus had not resulted from single or multiple point mutations from a closely related virus, and that emergence from a natural host was the most probable explanation of its origin (Murray et al. 1995b ). Serosurveillance of wild-caught wildlife, initially in the Brisbane index case paddock, and later the Mackay index case property, was undertaken to evaluate this hypothesis. Negative findings prompted broadening of the sample base to include sick and injured wildlife in temporary captivity. Apart from increasing the number of species and locations sampled, this approach offered the advantages of a convenient and cost-effective sample, and access to that subset of the greater wildlife population in sub-optimal health. Access to the latter was of particular interest, because if infection in a natural host was associated with disease or debility, then infected animals would be over-represented in this group and thus more readily detected. Species that were common to the two locations and able to move readily between the two locations were given the highest surveillance priority .",

The knowledge that viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae had previously been isolated from bats elsewhere (Henderson et al. 1995; Pavri et al. 1971 ) reinforced this focus. Of 27 flying foxes screened using this approach, 40% had antibodies neutralising Hendra virus (Field 2005 )a major breakthrough in the search for the origin of Hendra virus. Subsequently, virus was isolated from two species (Halpin et al. 2000) . Investigations of the role of flying foxes in the ecology of the virus continued, and subsequent studies showed evidence of previous exposure to Hendra virus in all four mainland Australian flying fox species across their range. Species ( Pteropus alecto ) and increasing age were risk factors for infection in flying foxes. Retrospective studies identified evidence of infection in flying foxes well before the first known spillover to horses (Field 2005) . These features suggest a major role for flying foxes in the ecology of Hendra virus, and are consistent a mature host-agent relationship. Subsequent studies identified neutralising antibodies to Hendra virus in multiple flying fox species in Papua New Guinea to the immediate north of Australia .

Molecular and serologic evidence indicating that Nipah and Hendra viruses were closely related made Malaysian bat species a logical surveillance priority. Malaysia has a great diversity of bat species: at least 13 described species of fruit bat (sub-order Megachiroptera ), including two flying fox species, and 60 described species of insectivorous bats (sub-order Microchiroptera ) in peninsular Malaysia alone (Medway 1978) . Wildlife rescue networks are less extensive in Malaysia than in Australia, thus an opportunistic sampling methodology was not a realistic option in the Nipah virus investigations, as it was in Australia with Hendra virus, and wild-caught bats were the primary survey target. Over a 5-week period, bat populations at multiple locations across peninsular Malaysia were sampled, with sampling locations including but not limited to the outbreak areas. Neutralising antibodies to Nipah virus were found in bats from five species, but predominantly in Pteropus hypomelanus and Pteropus vampyrus (Johara et al. 2001 ). Subsequently, Chua et al. (2002) recovered Nipah virus from the urine of P. hypomelanus and from partially eaten fruit which had been contaminated by bat saliva or, less likely, bat urine. Current research priorities include investigation of the population dynamics of P. vampyrus in Malaysia and across its range, and the dynamics of Nipah virus infection in P. vampyrus and P. hypomelanus (Daszak 2005) .",

Firstly, respiratory spread has not been demonstrated experimentally in any species, and the spatial pattern in naturally infected horses has not been consistent with respiratory spread. Secondly, Hendra virus has been isolated from the kidney and urine of horses and cats experimentally infected with Hendra virus, and cat-to-cat transmission and suspected cat-to-horse transmission have been attributed to exposure to infected urine (Westbury et al. 1996; Williamson et al. 1998) .

Although Hendra virus has yet to be isolated from flying fox urine, the previously described isolation of Nipah virus from the urine of free-living P. hypomelanus (Chua et al. 2002) supports urine as a plausible route of excretion for Hendra virus. The urine hypothesis is also supported by the experimental studies described above that attribute cat-to-cat and probable cat-to-horse transmission to exposure to infected urine. Another plausible hypothesis is that the ingestion of spats (the fibrous remains of masticated fruit dropped by feeding flying foxes) is the mode of transmission to horses. The quantity of these spats under food trees bearing fibrous fruit (such as the Ficus species present in the Brisbane index case paddock) can be substantial, and they may represent an attractive source of salivaladen virus to grazing horses. The viability of virus in spats is also likely to be prolonged due to slowed desiccation, heat and ultraviolet action. Hendra virus has been isolated from the oral cavity of experimentally infected horses (Williamson et al. 1998 ) and as previously noted, the closely related Nipah virus has been isolated from fruit partially eaten by bats (Chua et al. 2002) , supporting saliva as a plausible route of excretion of Hendra virus from flying foxes.",

The infectious dose, the routes of infection, and the physiological risk factors for infection in both species are unknown or incompletely understood. Managing the risk of spillover to horses is further constrained by the lack of knowledge of the incidence of infection and the temporal pattern of infection (and thus excretion) in flying foxes. Regardless of the mode of transmission to horses, it is evident from natural infections and experimental studies that horse-to-horse transmission is not readily effected. The apparent exception is the first recognised outbreak in the Brisbane stables that involved 20 equine cases. However, the temporal pattern of infection in this outbreak suggests that the index case was the source of infection for all cases and that no secondary infection occurred . Indeed, it is probable that horse-to-horse transmission in this instance was inadvertently facilitated by husbandry practices or other actions in the stable that resulted in the direct transmission of infected body fluids. Two plausible scenarios have been proposed: that a common syringe and needle was used to administer medication to the index case and to other (subsequently infected) horses; or that a cloth, bridle or other piece of equipment contaminated with infectious oral secretions from one horse was used on other (subsequently infected) horses. Likewise it is evident that horse-to-human transmission does not readily occur. Many people were potentially exposed to infection in the investigation of the Brisbane outbreak in particular, yet only the trainer and a strapper succumbed: both were closely involved in nursing the index case. It is also evident that bat-to-human transmission does not readily occur. After the identification of flying foxes as the origin of Hendra virus, a serologic survey of persons with high occupational or recreational exposure to flying foxes found none of 149 had neutralising antibodies to Hendra virus . Whether the apparently low infectivity for horses and humans is a reflection of the innate infectivity of Hendra virus, the instability of the virus outside the host, or of ineffective contact is unclear, although experimental studies support the former.",

Epidemiological (Nor et al. 2000) and experimental (Middleton et al. 2002 ) findings indicate that pigs are highly susceptible to infection, and thus once infection is introduced to a farm, on-farm spread is rapid. The primary mode of on-farm transmission was believed to be via the oro-nasal route; the primary means of spread between farms and between regions was the movement of pigs. Secondary modes of transmission between farms within localised farming communities may have included roaming infected dogs and cats, and sharing of boar semen (although at present, virus has not been identified in porcine semen). Trucks transporting pigs may also have introduced the virus onto farms (Nor et al. 2000) .",

They argue that the introduction of pathogens via global air travel and trade, the encroachment of human activities into wilderness regions, urbanisation, climatic changes and agricultural intensification are common drivers of emergence. For zoonotic diseases associated with wildlife reservoirs, anthropogenic factors that alter wildlife population structure, migration patterns and behaviour may also drive emergence of disease in human populations (Daszak et al. 2000 (Daszak et al. , 2001 . For example, human population encroachment into wildlife habitat may increase the risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne encephalitides by driving the loss of less competent reservoir hosts and promoting a more efficient one, namely the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000) . Likewise, the introduction of a \"new\" infection into a human or domestic animal population may follow the incursion of humans (accompanied by their domestic animals) into previously remote natural habitats where unknown disease agents exist in harmony with wild reservoir hosts. Upon contact with new species, an agent may jump species barriers, thereby spilling over into humans or livestock. Unlike the natural host, the new host may have no natural immunity or evolved resistance. Additionally, high population densities and management practices may facilitate the rapid spread of pathogens throughout livestock populations. Infection may be transmitted to humans directly from the natural host or via an intermediate host.",

The close phylogenetic relationship between Hendra and Nipah suggests a common progenitor. However, it also appears that flying fox populations in Australia and Malaysia have been separate for a length of time sufficient for the respective viruses to evolve further in geographic isolation. So what precipitated their emergence? Can environmental factors be identified that altered flying fox ecology and facilitated the movement of henipaviruses (and other bat-associated zoonoses) (Breed et al. 2005) beyond their natural ecological niche, precipitating their emergence? Disease emergence requires, in addition to the presence of an agent, an effective bridge from the natural host to a susceptible spillover host. Such bridges result from anthropogenic or natural changes to the agent, the host, or the environment. Available data on many fruit bat species suggests that populations in Australia and Asia are in decline and disruption throughout their range. In South-East Asia, anthropogenic activities (primarily habitat loss and hunting) have been identified as constituting the major threats. Deforestation, whether for agricultural land, commercial logging, or urban development, is widespread and results in loss or abandonment of roosting sites, and the loss of feeding habitats. Secondarily, habitat loss due to clearing is commonly exacerbated by tropical storms, the remnant forest being particularly prone to high wind damage (Mickleburg et al. 1992) . Hunting, whether for consumption or crop protection, and at both a local and a commercial level, results in the abandonment of roost and feeding sites (Mickleburg et al. 1992) . A scenario emerges of bat populations under stress, of altered foraging and behavioural patterns, of niche expansion, and of closer proximity to man. In eastern Australia, the increasing urban presence of flying foxes [thought to be due to more reliable and abundant food resources (Parry-Jones and Augee 2001)] and the associated changes in flying fox population dynamics, represents a similar emergencepromoting scenario for Hendra virus.",

            "text": "Worldwide, there are approximately 60 species of bats in the genus Pteropus (family Pteropodidae , sub-order Megachiroptera ). Their distribution extends from the west Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius, Madagascar and Comoro, along the sub-Himalayan region of Pakistan and India, through southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, southwest Pacific Islands as far east as the Cook Islands, and Australia (Fig. 3 ) . Although other genera of Pteropodidae are present on mainland Africa (i.e. Eidolon , Hypsignathus , Rousettus , etc.) and in Asia (i.e. Rousettus ), the genus Pteropus is restricted to Madagascar and surrounding islands in Africa; megachiropterans are absent from Europe and the Americas. Three of the four species of flying foxes found on mainland Australia are also found outside Australia. Black flying foxes ( P. alecto ), spectacled flying foxes ( P. conspicillatus ) and little red flying foxes ( P. scapulatus ) also occur in New Guinea, with the regional distribution of P. alecto extending to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi, Lombok, Kangean and Baeween, and P. conspicillatus extending to the Indonesian island of Halmahera (Hall and Richards 2000; Mickleburg et al. 1992; Nowak 1994) . Thus the distributions of two Australian species overlap with those of the island flying fox ( P. hypomelanus ) and the Malayan flying fox ( P. vampyrus ) in New Guinea and Indonesia. These species, at the northern extent of their range, overlap the Indian flying fox ( P. giganteus ) , whose distribution extends eastward from Thailand and Burma across to India and Pakistan. Where distributions overlap, roosting camps are commonly shared. Such a scenario would facilitate the transmission of infectious agents between neighbouring species, leading to the plausible existence of related viruses in flying fox populations across their range, as previously hypothesised (Daszak et al. 2000; Halpin et al. 2000) . Based on maximum species diversity, flying foxes are believed to have originated from Sulawesi and eastern New Guinea (to the north of Australia) and to have radiated to their present distribution (Hall and Richards 2000; Mickleburg et al. 1992; Nowak 1994) . Thus, by extension, if henipaviruses have co-evolved with flying foxes, it is likely that they exist across their entire geographic distribution. This hypothesis could readily be tested by screening long-isolated populations from the western extent of the global pteropid range.",

Quarantine of infected premises, movement controls on stock, and disinfection have proved effective strategies . A Hendra virus vaccine is not currently available and development of one is not foreseen. Australian veterinarians have a high awareness of Hendra virus, and Hendra virus exclusion is routinely undertaken for horses exhibiting an acute respiratory syndrome. Veterinarians involved in these disease investigations wear appropriate protective equipment and use a limited necropsy approach, as horses have been the source of infection for all four human cases. Putative risk factors for infection in horses have been previously proposed -breed (thoroughbred), sex (female), age (>8 years), pregnancy status (late pregnancy), housing (paddocked), season (late gestation or the birthing season of local flying foxes), and the presence of favoured flying fox food trees in the index case paddock . In the two 2004 cases, the putative association with age, paddock status, season and flying fox food source was maintained (Field et al. 2007) . A considerable research focus on the ecology of Hendra virus has yet to define the route of virus excretion or any temporal pattern of infection in flying foxes. This information, and knowledge of the actual mode of flying fox-to-horse transmission would facilitate a risk management approach to spillover infection in horses.",

            "text": "In strong contrast to Hendra virus, the Nipah virus outbreak in peninsular Malaysia in 1999 had an enormous economic and social impact. Nipah virus was highly infectious for pigs, with all classes of pigs susceptible. The pattern of on-farm infection was consistent with respiratory transmission; betweenfarm spread was generally associated with the movement of pigs. The extensive post-outbreak surveillance program in Malaysia showed that farms that did not receive pigs generally remained uninfected even when neighbouring farms were infected. Human infections were predominantly attributed to contact with live pigs; none was attributed to contact with bats. Horizontal transmission was not a feature of infection in humans (although the potential for person-to-person transmission was noted previously). Recommended host management strategies primarily target pig-to-pig transmission, secondarily the flying fox-pig interface (that is, the natural host-spillover host interface). The central strategy is the implementation of sound farm management practices, such as monitoring herd health and early recognition of disease syndromes. The latter includes maintaining the high level of farmer and veterinarian awareness of the disease generated by the outbreak. A second key strategy is the strict application of farm-gate biosecurity (Daniels 2000) , with clearly defined protocols for the introduction of new stock. These may include quarantine and/or exclusion testing. A Nipah virus vaccine is not currently available and development of one is unlikely in the near future. Overarching the above is a strategy of advanced planning for emergency management of disease outbreaks. This involves established surveillance, detection, and emergency response capabilities. The pre-existence of the latter in Malaysia enabled the implementation of effective quarantine, movement controls, and culling to bring the outbreak under control. The Malaysian pig population is now free of Nipah virus infection.",

The removal of fruit orchards and other favoured flying fox food trees from the immediate vicinity of pig sheds greatly reduces the probability of flying fox-pig contact. Similarly, the wire screening of open-sided pig sheds is a simple and inexpensive strategy to prevent direct contact between flying foxes and pigs. Indirect contact (with flying fox urine, faeces or spats, or with partially eaten fruit) can be avoided by ensuring roof run-off does not enter pig pens (Chua 2003) . The emergence (or detection) of apparently directly transmitted infection from the natural reservoir to humans and subsequent person-to-person transmission (as appears to be the case in Bangladesh) presents a new and formidable risk management challenge.",

Hence the name equine morbillivirus was tentatively ascribed to the virus.

Under the four plausible future scenarios developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Report (Anonymous 2005a) , these rates of change in biodiversity are projected to continue or to accelerate. There is increasing realisation of the interconnectedness of the ecosystem and human health, and the relationship between the environment, human and non-human hosts, and pathogens. Daszak et al. (2000) argue that most emerging diseases exist within a finely balanced host-agent continuum between wildlife, domestic animal and human populations. Taylor et al. (2001) , in examining risk factors for disease emergence, conclude that emerging diseases are three times more likely to be associated with zoonotic pathogens than with non-zoonotic pathogens. An ecosystem health approach recognises the critical linkages between human activity, ecological change and health, and fosters a multidisciplinary approach that considers a range of influencing factors such as medical, environmental, economic and socio-political factors. The complexity of the emergence and epidemiology of the henipaviruses warrants such a broad, cross-disciplinary ecosystem health approach if the associated mechanisms are to be understood and future risks managed.",

Their ability to dramatically impact human and animal health, and the associated societal and economic consequences, has been clearly illustrated. Horizontal transmission of henipaviruses in humans, absent in Australia and Malaysia, appears to be an alarming feature of Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh. If transmission in humans becomes efficient, the potential exists for a worst-case emergence scenario. Further, if henipaviruses, and the necessary and sufficient precipitating emergence factors exist across the distribution of all pteropid species, the emergence of further novel agents can be expected unless factors associated with emergence are addressed.",
