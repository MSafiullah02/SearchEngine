Having only three hospitals in Italy dedicated exclusively to infectious diseases, L. Sacco Hospital in Milan, the National Institute for Infectious Diseases -INMI Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome, Domenico Cotugno Hospital in Naples, in the first phase of the outbreak, we needed to redesign the organization of emergency radiology units in local hospitals to create dedicated tracks for evaluation of individuals with suspected infection and for patients with known diagnoses. Separation between those subjects who had or were suspected to have COVID-19 and other presumed non-infected patients admitted to the emergency room was the first priority. Having entered the second phase with fewer individuals presenting to the emergency room and an increase in the number of hospitalized patients, the creation of dedicated and protected internal access paths to radiology services was necessary.",

Ease of disinfection of the equipment and accessibility to bedridden patients were the main reasons for this choice, as suggested by the authors [1] . CXR can easily differentiate between normal and severely abnormal chest, reducing the need for CT exams, and it is also useful for monitoring inpatients, together with lung US, performed by the anaesthesiologist. However, CXR sensitivity is low, particularly at an early stage of the disease [3] .",

However, considering the high volumes of COVID-19 patients and the length of the sanitization procedures of CT scanner room in the interval between two consecutive patients, many Italian hospitals dedicated CT equipment to COVID-19 patients only. If this was not possible, they established specific internal protocols, to scan COVID-19 positive patients consecutively and sanitizing CT scanner room at the end of the shift. In few hospitals where dedicated CT scanners were not available, or the patient volume was too high, a mobile CT device was rented.",
