For general communities, epidemic modeling based on social networks is being recognized as a useful tool. However, disease propagation may occur in a healthcare facility in a manner different from that in a urban community setting due to different network architecture. We simulate stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on social networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed social networks in the hospital have hierarchical and modular structure in which dense substructure such as departments, wards, and rooms, are globally but only loosely connected, and do not reveal extremely right-skewed distributions of the number of contacts per individual. We show that healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors (i.e. transmitters) of diseases on these networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority rather than patients or nurses is more effective.",

There have been many modeling reports on disease spreading on complex social networks (Meyers et al., 2003; Christley et al., 2005; Keeling and Eames, 2005; Meyers et al., 2005; Pourbohloul et al., 2005; Watts et al., 2005; Colizza et al., 2006; Green et al., 2006; Riley, 2007; Volz and Meyers, 2007) . A central theoretical finding is that hubs, namely, those who have contacts to relatively many others, communicate and enhance disease transmission. Diseases spread to a great extent with larger probability on heterogeneous networks such as scale-free networks in which the number of contacts that each individual maintains is highly heterogeneous (Hethcote and Yorke, 1984; Anderson et al., 1986; Albert et al., 2000; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001) . Such heterogeneous networks are operative in sexually transmitted diseases (Liljeros et al., 2001) and computer viruses (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001) .",

First, social networks of healthcare facilities may be structured differently from networks of urban communities or the whole world. In terms of size, a hospital is typically much smaller than an urban community. In terms of microscopic structure, contact patterns in a hospital are regulated by hierarchy defined by departments, wards, and rooms. To our knowledge, efficient containment strategies for social networks with such modular structure have not been established. Second, a healthcare facility is composed of individuals of distinct roles, such as patients, visitors, and healthcare workers. Healthcare workers can be subdivided into different classes, such as nurses and medical doctors. Susceptibility, mortality, infectiousness, and many other factors that affect how diseases spread depend on the type of individuals. For example, junior doctors may visit more wards than nurses do, possibly carrying pathogens from ward to ward (CDR weekly 2005) . Patients may be less active but likely have larger case fatality (i.e. fraction of death among infected individuals) than healthcare workers (Leung et al., 2004; Forrester and Pettitt, 2005) . In urban community social networks, the role of different types of individuals in disease propagation may not be so clear-cut.",

The average of the distribution shown as each vertical cross section, i.e. for each value of \u03bb, corresponds to the solid line in Fig. 3a . Above a threshold infection rate, the distribution has two masses. One thin mass is concentrated around zero and indicates that, despite a large infection rate, the epidemic can quickly decline to extinction owing to demographic stochasticity of state I individuals (i.e. minor epidemic). The other mass is centered around a positive value of the final size and corresponds to the major epidemic. Precisely speaking, the major epidemic consists of two peaks. This is because one ward, which is devoted to the psychiatry department, has 42 (of 605) individuals and is connected to the rest of the network via only two junior doctors. These doctors examine patients from departments to which they previously belonged, in addition to patients from the psychiatry department. Suppose that the disease starts from the index case in this ward. Disease must pass through the narrow channel composed of the two doctors to spread to the rest of the population. This event occurs with a somewhat low probability even for very large infection rates. This causes the lower peak of the upper mass around 0.9 in Fig. 3b , which is eminent for \u03bb \u2265 0.8. We confirmed that a two-mass distribution, possibly with subdivisions of each mass reflecting modular structure of the network, underlies each of the following numerical results. In addition, whereas an epidemic whose final size is near the mean value rarely occurs because of the two-mass distribution shown in Fig. 3b , a larger mean final size indicates a larger probability of major epidemic. Therefore we will show only the mean values of the final size in later figures, Both for nosocomial pathogens such as MRSA (Forrester and Pettitt, 2005) and other pathogens such as SARS (Leung et al., 2004) , the case fatality of hospitalized patients is much larger than that of healthcare workers. The final sizes shown in Fig. 3a and 3b represent incidences, that is, infection events. Frequency of observing severe manifestations or deaths needs to be discussed separately. To highlight differential mortalities between healthcare workers and patients (Leung et al., 2004) , we assume that only patients, not nurses or medical doctors, always die after being infected for some time (see Discussion for justification). The nurses and doctors in state R are assumed to be cured after being infected. These individuals are counted for the final size but not for the final fraction of mortality. Consequently, the final fraction of mortality is defined to be the final fraction of state R among the patients only. The fraction of mortality and its distribution, shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d , respectively, change little from those for the final size.",

Under the intervention, we reassign the patients without destroying the team structure; we will relax this condition in the next intervention method. Suppose that both teams t 1 and t 2 examine a patient in ward w 1 and another patient in ward w 2 . In the example shown in Fig. 4a , teams t 1 and t 2 trade one of their patients. Then team t 1 examines two patients in ward w 1 and team t 2 examines two patients in ward w 2 , thus allowing each team to visit just one ward.

With this modification, doctor Dr 1 and nurse Ns 1 in Fig. 4a , for example, is connected by two edges. Equivalently, we increase the transmission rate of this single edge twofold to account for the doubled contact rate between them, which comes from the fact that Dr 1 and Ns 1 examine twice patients together (two patients after the intervention versus one patient before the intervention). The edge duplication is also done for a Pt-Dr edge whenever the number of doctors that examine the patient on this edge decreases as a result of intervention. Consequently, the number of Pt-Dr edges and that of Ns-Dr edges return to those of the original network. This implies that the quality of the medical service that we measure by the number of Pt-Ns and Pt-Dr edges does not degrade due to the intervention.

Accordingly, we duplicate the edge between Pt 1 and Dr 1 . In addition, we compensate the contact rate, or the number of edges, between nurses and doctors by duplicating the corresponding Ns-Dr edges, as in intervention 1. Taking the edge duplication into account, the numbers of Pt-Dr and Ns-Dr edges, as well as those of Pt-Pt, Pt-Ns, and Ns-Ns edges, are preserved. A byproduct of this modification is that the service quality assessed by the amount of the Pt-Ns and Pt-Dr edges is restored. The total number of edges after modified intervention 2 is 3004 (see Tab. 1 for the number of each type of edges), which is close to 3046, the number for the original network. The persisting reduction in the number of edges comes from that of Dr-Dr edges.

For an extremely large infection rate for which more than two-thirds of the population becomes infected, intervention 3 is more efficient at control than intervention 2. Our claim that introducing single rooms may be ineffective is consistent with an observation analysis (Cepeda et al., 2005) and a modeling study (Bootsma et al., 2006) of MRSA.",

The degreebased vaccination is superceded by the betweenness-based vaccination for a wide range of \u03bb, agreeing with the previous modeling work by Holme et al. (2002) . The betweenness-based vaccination is effective because interward communication is inhibited after vaccination of key individuals. These key individuals are mostly medical doctors and sometimes nurses. In our simulations, the two doctors who connect the nearly isolated ward to the remainder of the network, whom we mentioned in Sec. 3.2, have the largest and the third largest betweenness centrality values. These doctors are actually vaccinated in the betweenness-based protocol. A disease does not enter a subnetwork if the entire network is fragmented after removing such key individuals. Even if the network is not fragmented after vaccination, a chain of transmission has to make detours, which makes disease spreading less likely. This is presumably because important shortcuts owned by central individuals have been cut out.",

Therefore, the common result that scale-free networks boost epidemics owing to hubs, which hold for well-mixed networks with right-skewed degree distributions (Hethcote and Yorke, 1984; Anderson et al., 1986; Albert et al., 2000; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Meyers et al., 2003; Christley et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2005) , seems to be rather irrelevant to the current situation, as has been pointed out for other situations (Holme et al., 2002; Watts et al., 2005; Green et al., 2006; Ichinomiya, 2007) . For our networks, we have shown that the vaccination protocols based on the betweenness centrality, which target individuals that tend to maintain shortcuts, are more effective than that based on the degree. The network structure identified in this work may serve as a basis for network-based quantification studies.",

Therefore, vaccinating healthcare workers may be more effective than vaccinating patients in preventing nosocomial infection (Carman et al., 2000; Meyers et al., 2003) . These results are consistent with ours. We have further distinguished roles of different classes of healthcare workers, namely, medical doctors and nurses, which was ignored in an observation study of nosocomial infection in which only patients were considered (Liljeros et al., 2007) . We also examined the effects of individuality in terms of their position in the networks. We suggest that healthcare workers, doctors in particular, with large betweenness centrality values are of high mobidity in nosocomial infection. Because the betweenness centrality is an ad hoc measure for our purpose, there may be alternative measures more directly related to mobidity of individuals.",

In this situation, a powerful vaccination strategy based on only the local information is ring vaccination in which vaccinations are provided along chains of contacts reconstructed by querying friends' names (Ferguson et al., 2001; Cohen et al., 2003; Pourbohloul et al., 2005) . An alternative strategy is to abandon heterogeneous contact rates at the level of individuals and employ a population-based approach in which distributions of contact rates are approximated using discrete population groups such as age groups (Wallinga et al., 2006) . However, the use of global information can be practical in the nosocomial setting because healthcare facilities are limited in size. In addition, the information about contacts between individuals may be more available than in the case of urban community infection. We have obtained this information by analyzing medical records.",

First, we have neglected the weight of edges, or equivalently, heterogeneity in the transmission rate of individuals, except partial consideration in interventions 1 and 2 and in the sensitivity analysis. In reality, a Pt-Pt edge may be stronger than a Pt-Dr edge because the patients in the same room spend much time together, whereas a doctor examines a patient possibly for a couple of minutes per day. We have ignored this factor because the information available is limited (but see Bansal et al. 2006 ) and because the actual edge weights will depend on the type of diseases. Related to this, we have assumed frequency-dependent transmission in which the infection rate is proportional to the number of edges involved. Although this assumption is valid for sexually transmitted diseases (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2004) , whether this assumption holds for nosocomial pathogens is not known.",

Nosocomial pathogens such as MRSA and VRE cause asymptomatic infection in which carriers, of which there are many types, do not necessarily infect others. In the SIR model, incubation periods are ignored and all the individuals are as susceptible and infectious as others at a common infection rate. However, given the robustness of our results against heterogeneous infection rates for different individuals shown in Sec. 3.3.4, we expect that our finding is extended to more general situations of disease spreading. Modeling dynamics of particular nosocomial pathogens is an important future problem.",

In reality, the members of a hospital change on a very short time scale due to, for example, admission and discharge of patients (Bootsma et al., 2006; Liljeros et al., 2007) In conclusion, the present study examined the spread of nosocomial infection in explicitly structured and observation-based social networks in a hospital, emphasizing the importance of controlling medical doctors as a potential major vector of diseases. Despite the necessity of various improvements, we believe that our exercise highlights specific hierarchical structure of social networks of hospitals and associated disease spreading patterns. ",
