As shown in Fig. 2C, the radius of gyration of the molecule was 59 \u00c5, much larger than that expected for a 99 kDa globular protein (Fig. 2F), and Kratky plot showed that the protein was partially extended in solution (Fig. 2D). This is in consistent with the model that the NTD and CTD do not interact, and the two NTDs in the dimer are likely to move freely in solution. A representative structure of NP45-365 based on CORAL simulations is shown in Fig. 2E. Due to the flexible nature of the linker region, this structure represents only a model of the conformational ensemble and does not represent a structure per se. However, the model captures features of the conformational ensemble and allows for the qualitative analysis of gross structural features. The most prominent feature of the model is that the flexible linker does not adopt a fully extended conformation, suggesting the existence of residual structures within the linker.",
