These predictions implicitly assume a full social mixing, which is not plausible generally. Here I am showing a counterexample to the these predictions, based on random propagation of an epidemic in Barab\u00e1si-Albert scale-free network models. The start of the epidemic suggests R 0 = 2.6, but unlike \u2126 \u2248 70% predicted by the SIR model, they reach a final extent of only \u2126 \u2248 4% without external mitigation. Daily infection rate at the top of the curve is also an order of magnitude less than in SIR models. Quarantining only the 1.5% most active superspreaders has similar effect on extent and top infection rate as blind quarantining a random 50% of the full community.",

The model assumes a homogeneuous environment and full social mixing. The implicit assumptions are: 1) the expectation number of new infections caused by an ill person is constant in the entire population -this number is a model parameter, R 0 , and 2) anyone in the society can be infected by anyone else with the same probability. The persons are initially susceptible (S), after they get the disease and become ill (I), and they infect new persons. Among these, the susceptible persons develop disease and spread again, and those who have been recovered (R) and have immunity do not get ill again and do not spread the disease again. The resulting differential equations predict an exponential initial phase, where the trend reflects R 0 . If R 0 > 1, the epidemics develop, and if R 0 < 1, it decays out.",

Current estimates of the COVID-19 disease suggest R 0 = 2.2-2.6, indicating that 60-70% of the population will be rapidly infected before the pandemics cease, and the duration of the hump will be roughly 3 months in the UK ( [3] ). These predictions quantitatively much rely on the assumed homogeneity of the society and on the full random mixing during the propagation of the disease. Here I am showing a simple example where infections are transmitted via a scale-free social network, and in this case the propagation scenarios can follow a much milder evolution after the early steep upslope than in the homogeneous model. This can base a less pessimistic scenario of the prognosis of the epidemic develompent, despite of its intensive start.",

On one hand, this is due to the local pre-immunisation of network. If a person gets infection at a step, it must have come from a connection. When the infected person transmits the disease, that pre-immunised connection will not more be susceptible. This way, the susceptible connections is reduced by at least 1 from the first step. Also, the development of the epidemics applies an optimal immunisation to the network. [5] proposed that in case of limited immunisation, the probability that a certain node is chosen to be immunised is proportional to its degree. In all steps in the scale-free models, the susceptible persons get the disease -and then, immunitywith a probability that is proportional to the number of their connections, and hence, distributes a fractional immunity in an optimal way.

Again, left and right panels q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq qq q qqq q q q q q q q q show closed communities and opened communities with transmitted infections from outside, respectively. These quarantines are effective in slowing down the upslope and the final extent of the epidemic by a factor of 3-6, but it has to be noted that the persons remain in quarantine along the entire simulation, also at the end point. In the open scenarios (C+ and D+) this factor is \u22483, which is a factor of 1.5 in the case when half of the community is in quarantine and unavailable for the infection (C+).",

Initially, the epidemic curve rises steeply in scale-free networks, reflecting that the infection rapidly finds the superspreaders, who transmit the illness to many persons in the population. Therefore, the initially observed exponential increment rate can much exceed the average transmission rate in the population, because the we mostly observe the disease propagation driven by superspreading events. Since R 0 is estimated from the realised transmissions at the initial part of the curve, the overrepresentation of superspreading events here overweights the transmission rates of the superspreaders, and heavily biases the estimated R 0 .",
