The features evaluated in more than one study with the lowest LRs (<0.60) for diagnosing of heart failure were the following: the overall clinical judgment, no prior history of heart failure, no dyspnea on exertion, the absence of rales, and the absence of radiographic pulmonary venous congestion, or cardiomegaly. The single finding that decreased the likelihood of heart failure the most was a BNP <100 pg/mL. While the findings of this study are useful when assessing dyspneic patients suspected of having heart failure, no individual feature is sufficiently powerful in isolation to rule heart failure in or out. Therefore, an overall clinical impression based on all available information is best. If the appropriate constellation of findings with high LRs for heart failure are present, that may be sufficient to warrant empirical treatment without further urgent investigations''",

When measured, serum level should be collected at 12-24 h after the last dose (post-distribution phase). While the upper normal limit is 2.6 nmol/L [2.0 ng/mL], higher digoxin levels may be seen in asymptomatic patients. Low-dose digoxin, resulting in serum levels 0.5-0.9 nmol/L [0.4-0.7 ng/mL] is associated with possible survival benefit compared to !1 nmol/L [!0.78 ng/mL] in HF patients MECHANISM-digitalis acts by inhibiting the membrane-bound Na/K ATPase transport system. This leads to intracellular loss of K and gain of Na. Increase in intracellular Ca leads to \" cardiac contractility. Digoxin also exerts a vagotonic action, which slows conduction through the SA and AV node and helps to control heart rate PRECIPITANTS OF DIGOXIN TOXICITY-toxicity is not merely related to serum levels, but also digoxin dosing (e.g. acute overdose), other medications (e.g. non-potassium sparing diuretics), and conditions (e.g. renal insufficiency, acute coronary syndromes, cardiac amyloidosis, hypothyroidism). For instance, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hypomagnesemia and acidosis predispose to toxicity even at low-serum digoxin levels because of their depressive effects on the Na/K ATPase pump. In contrast, hyperkalemia occurs in acute toxicity and is directly related to prognosis HEART SOUNDS TECHNIQUE-S1, S2, and physiological splitting of S2 are best heard over the base.

Two exceptions are the systolic murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which usually becomes much louder, and the systolic murmur of mitral valve prolapse, which becomes longer and often louder (click moves closer to S1) POSITIONAL CHANGES-most murmurs diminish with standing due to reduced preload. However, the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy becomes louder and the murmur of mitral valve prolapse lengthens and often is intensified. Squatting (or usually passive leg raising, both \" venous return and \" systemic arterial resistance) produces opposite effect ISOMETRIC EXERCISE (\" systemic arterial resistance)-murmurs caused by blood flow across normal or obstructed valves (e.g. mitral or pulmonic stenosis) become louder.

Occlude a collapsed superficial vein just below the site of suspected reflux from deep to superficial system. With patient standing, observe refilling of vein. Rapid refilling despite occlusion suggests incompetence of valves in the deep venous system, while slow refilling with occlusion and rapid refilling after occlusion is removed suggests incompetence of valves in the superficial venous system)RATIONAL CLINICAL EXAMINATION SERIES: DOES THE CLINICAL EXAMINATION PREDICT LOWER EXTREMITY PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE?

Check for return of rubor as the legs are lowered. Abnormal if angle of circulation <08 i.e. legs below table), venous filling time (raise leg to 458 for 1 min with patient supine position for vein to collapse. With patient then sitting up and legs dangling, determine the time for vein to refill. Abnormal if >20 s) (LR+ 3.6, LR-0.8) APPROACH-''for screening patients who require further testing to diagnose peripheral arterial disease, the most useful individual symptoms and signs are: claudication, femoral bruit and a pulse abnormality on palpation. The absence of claudication and the presence of normal pulses decrease the likelihood of moderate to severe disease. When considering patients who are symptomatic with leg complaints, the most useful individual findings are the presence of cool skin, the presence of at least 1 bruit and any palpable pulse abnormality. The absence of any bruit (iliac, femoral and popliteal) and the presence of normal peripheral pulses reduce the likelihood of peripheral arterial disease''JAMA2006 295:5 DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH-ABI <0.9 is sufficient for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease as it suggests >50% stenosis of peripheral vasculature (sens 90%, spc 98%). Patients with large vessel disease (distal aorta or iliac arteries) may only have abnormal ABI after exercise. Patients with non-compressible vessels should have toe-brachial index done.

The sensitivity of palpation appears to be reduced by abdominal obesity.

In view of the low sensitivity, the absence of a systolic bruit is not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. In view of the high specificity, the presence of a systolic bruit (in particular a systolic-diastolic bruit) in a hypertensive patient is suggestive of renovascular hypertension. In view of the lack of evidence to support characterizing bruits as to pitch, intensity and location, bruits should be reported only as systolic or systolic/diastolic'' JAMA COPD-RAD, # amplitude, multifocal atrial tachycardia HYPERCALCEMIA-short QT HYPOCALCEMIA-prolonged QT WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE SYNDROME-short PR (<120 ms), delta wave, prolonged QRS (>120 ms), symptomatic tachycardia.
