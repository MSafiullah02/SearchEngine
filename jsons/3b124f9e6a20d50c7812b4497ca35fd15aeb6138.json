[8] [9] [10] The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes neurologic damage are multifaceted, including direct damage to specific receptors, cytokinerelated injury, secondary hypoxia, and retrograde travel along nerve fibers. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Much like its expression on lung epithelial cells, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier can allow viral binding at this important site, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f facilitating viral entry into the central nervous system by attacking the vasculature. 16, 17 The binding of SARS-CoV-2 at the pulmonary epithelial cells also generates a global systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), producing increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1); activating glial cells; and producing a massive proinflammatory central nervous system state. 13 In particular, IL-6 levels have been correlated with increased disease severity in COVID-19. [11] [12] [13] These systemic effects combined with localized lung alveolar damage result in severe hypoxia, which can lead to cerebral vasodilation and may decompensate into cerebral edema and ischemia. 13, 14 Finally, SARS-CoV-2 travels retrograde along the olfactory nerve and bulb, which provides an avenue between the nasal epithelium and the central nervous system and may also explain the common complaint of anosmia. 15 The prevalence of neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 patients has become more apparent, though pre-existing neurologic conditions have been linked to more severe COVID-19",

            "text": "Acute cerebrovascular disease remains one of the more common and serious neurologic complications seen in COVID-19 populations. However, this final common manifestation has a multifactorial etiology. SARS-CoV-2 causes a global inflammatory response and a hypercoagulable state evidenced by increased D-dimers, prolonged prothrombin time, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. 20, 27 In an Italian cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted with confirmed infection, the rate of ischemic stroke was 2.5%, despite venous thromboembolism prophylaxis on admission. 28 In comparison, the rate of ischemic stroke in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China was estimated to be as high as 5%. 24 Similarly, there was a 3.7% incidence of ischemic stroke in Dutch COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. 29 Interestingly, COVID-19 has also led to younger patients presenting with ischemic stroke, including large vessel J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f occlusions. 30 Additionally, COVID-19 patients can develop significant hypoxia leading to decreased cerebral oxygenation and infarcts, particularly in those with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease. 13, 14 Infection, inflammation, and hypercoagulable states can further increase the risk of ischemic stroke, which can be even more pronounced in older patients. [31] [32] [33] When evaluating COVID-19 patients with stroke-like symptoms, it is important to protect the healthcare team while expediting this time-sensitive emergency. The American Heart Association has addressed this with guidelines for a protected code stroke, emphasizing screening guidelines, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management. 34 However, once diagnosed with a stroke, patients should still receive the standard of care based on their institution with consideration of intravenous thrombolytic medications and endovascular thrombectomy in the appropriate clinical scenarios, without any alteration to intervention criteria. 35, 36 ",

[52] [53] [54] Lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin interact with many common medications in patients with prior strokes including antihypertensives, antiplatelets, statins, and anticoagulants. [52] [53] [54] [55] These also carry an increased risk of neurocognitive impairment in longer courses. [55] [56] [57] Ribavirin and interferon alpha have both neuropathic and neuropsychiatric sequelae, while interferon caries a risk of retinopathy. 58, 59 Similarly, antimalarials also carry the risk of neuropsychiatric side effects and less commonly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ataxia, seizures, and limbic encephalitis. 60 A complete summary of mechanism of action, neurologic effects, and medication interactions can be found in Table 2 .
