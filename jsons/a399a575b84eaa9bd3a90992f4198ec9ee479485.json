The true denominator of individuals with COVID-19 remains unknown as a fraction of cases are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, leading to undertesting and under-reporting, and subsequently biasing estimates of prevalent disease, risk factors and incident cardiovascular events. Additionally, there is considerable heterogeneity in defining myocardial injury across studies. Variability also exists within demographics (including age, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors) and clinical comorbidities from region to region and across countries, leading to tangible differences in risk. Thus, we need consistent testing of populations for COVID-19, systematic data collection and biomarker testing, standardised definitions and consistent reporting from countries to more accurately estimate rates of myocardial injury and its associated clinical implications.",

What remains unknown is the mechanism of myocardial injury as we are limited in the degree of myocardial characterisation in most cases. It is highly probable that there are a number of different aetiologies 2 8 that may vary by individual case and overlap in many instances. Putative mechanisms include: 1. Myocardial injury may be due to unmasking of underlying cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of baseline cardiovascular comorbidities is high with COVID-19 (table 1) , particularly in those with more severe disease. If there is pre-existing cardiovascular disease, the lack of cardiac reserve would predispose to injury in setting of a physiological stress response. 2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) either due to plaque rupture, demand ischaemia or vasospasm is certainly conceivable. Given haemodynamic changes and exaggerated inflammatory response frequently seen with COVID-19, risk for ACS is heightened. 8 ",

Mononuclear infiltrates in myocardial tissue consistent with myocarditis have been described in postmortem case reports of COVID-19. 8 Although myocarditis has been suspected in many cases of COVID-19, definitive confirmation requires tissue histology and immunohistochemistry and has not been frequently pursued; hence, the true frequency of myocarditis remains unknown. Consensus statements in heart failure (HF) recommend endomyocardial biopsy for cases of fulminant HF, unexplained new-onset HF that fails to respond to usual care or when a specific diagnosis would alter management; suspected myocarditis in COVID-19 may meet these criteria. However, immunosuppression for lymphocytic myocarditis has not shown consistent benefit and whether this applies to COVID-19 is unknown. 5. Stress cardiomyopathy is frequently precipitated by acute emotional or physical stress, and can be triggered by increased sympathetic stimulation, high catecholamine states, microcirculatory dysfunction, vasospasm and proinflammatory states, all of which can occur with COVID-19. It remains a diagnosis based on identification of an acute trigger and exclusion of other cardiovascular disease. A clue may be in the biomarker profile, in which case peak troponin is disproportionately low relative to the degree of cardiac dysfunction, while B-type natriuretic peptide levels are markedly elevated.",

Moreover, it remains unclear whether myocardial injury serves as the intermediary between COVID-19, systemic disease and mortality, or whether myocardial injury is a marker of systemic organ failure and a by-product of advanced disease. A look into ClinicalTrials. gov finds many ongoing and upcoming trials of investigational agents for COVID-19. These range from the widely discussed hydroxychloroquine to block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, antivirals including remdesivir, combination protease inhibitor lopinavir/ ritonavir, recombinant ACE2 that may protect against lung injury, IL-6 receptor antagonists, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, interferon, steroids and a number of other agents. 2 8 However, the balance of risk-to-benefit is impacted by efficacy and appropriateness of treatment. For example, immunomodulatory treatments may not be the best option when the mechanism of myocardial injury is stress cardiomyopathy or ACS, unless there is a non-cardiac indication for administration.",

However, this is often restricted by the need to reduce additional exposure and in the setting of non-myocarditis causes of myocardial injury, the diagnostic utility may be low. Given these concerns, advanced imaging with cardiac MRI would be the preferred non-invasive modality for tissue characterisation and can serve as a surrogate for biopsy to differentiate between aetiologies of myocardial injury.
