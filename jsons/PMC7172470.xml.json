            "text": "CD13, aminopeptidase N, is a cell surface antigen used in human leukocyte typing (Riemann et al., 1999) and functions as a membrane-bound metalloproteinase that catalyzes the removal of N-terminal amino acids from polypeptides and small peptides (Mizutani et al., 1993, Hooper, 1994). CD13 is expressed in epithelial cells in liver, kidney and intestine, in placenta, brain and spleen, and in a variety of hematopoietic cells. Recently, roles for CD13 in metastasis and in the degradation of extracellular matrix components by tumor cells were reported (Saiki et al., 1993, Fujii et al., 1995). In addition, CD13 was identified as a receptor for tumor-homing peptides in the vasculature of tumors and appears to play a role in the aberrant angiogenesis of tumor tissues. Therefore, CD13 was proposed as a useful target for the delivery of drugs to tumors that aim at inhibiting angiogenesis (Pasqualini et al., 2000). Furthermore, CD13 is a receptor for cytomegalovirus (CMV; Soderberg et al., 1993, Giugni et al., 1996) and certain coronaviruses (Delmas et al., 1992, Yeager et al., 1992) and future antiviral strategies directed against these viruses may also benefit from including CD13 as a target (Larsson et al., 1998).",

The antigen is present on early hematopoietic progenitors including progenitors of the B- and T-lymphoid lineages, and expression is progressively reduced with increasing maturation of these cells. The antigen is not detectable on mature lymphocytes from peripheral blood, spleen and tonsils (Spits et al., 1995). CD13 is often upregulated on malignant cells, particularly on blasts from acute and chronic B-cell leukemias (ALLs and CLLs), including infant pro-B cell leukemias (Makrynikola et al., 1995). The pro-B ALLs frequently express CD19, CD22 and CDw75 as lymphoid markers and CD13, CD15, CD33, CDw65 as myeloid markers (Stong et al., 1985, Greil et al., 1994). The expression of myeloid markers on a pro-B cell background is unusual and highly characteristic for these particular leukemias. Therefore, special terms including \u2018biphenotypic expression\u2019 and \u2018mixed-lineage phenotype\u2019 have been coined to designate this property.",

            "text": "The mixed lineage phenotype provides a unique opportunity to direct novel immuno-therapeutic approaches against the pro-B ALLs that are often refractory to other forms of treatment. In particular, infants with leukemias associated with translocations t(4;11) and t(11;19) affecting the MLL-gene on chromosome 11q23 have poor prognosis and new therapeutic approaches for these leukemias are needed (Behm et al., 1996, Heerema et al., 1999). Immunotherapeutic approaches targeting individual antigens on tumor cells have suffered in the past from the fact that the same antigens were also present on normal cells. By contrast, the mixed-lineage antigen spectrum is preferentially found on the tumor cells and therefore offers novel possibilities to specifically target the tumor cells. The long-range objective of our research is to contribute to the development of immunotherapeutic approaches against leukemic blasts with chromosomal translocations t(4;11) or t(11;19) to the MLL gene. For this purpose cDNAs coding for antibodies or antibody fragments reactive with several of the component antigens of the mixed lineage spectrum are needed.",

            "text": "The immediate purpose of the present study was to generate recombinant single chain Fv fragments (scFv) that bind human CD13 in its native conformation on intact human leukemic blasts. To our knowledge, no reports on scFvs reactive against hCD13 on intact cells have been published, although a number of anti-human CD13 hybridoma antibodies have been reported (Goyert, 1997). A standard procedure for the generation of scFvs consists in the bacterial expression of the antigen followed by biochemical purification and the use of the purified antigen for the immunization of mice. However, hCD13 is heavily glycosylated (Look et al., 1989) and an authentic glycosylation is not achieved by bacterial expression. Therefore, mice immunized with bacterially expressed antigen may produce antibodies reacting only with the recombinant protein, but not with the antigen in its native conformation on human cells (Chowdhury et al., 1998, Huls et al., 1999). An alternative strategy that avoids the use of bacterially expressed hCD13 would involve the preparation of cell surface membranes from CD13 positive human cells, such as CD13-expressing leukemia cells (Stong et al., 1985, Greil et al., 1994). The disadvantage of this approach is that the immunized mice are likely to produce an excess of antibodies against other human cell surface antigens and antibodies against hCD13 may be of low abundance. Anti-hCD13 scFvs would, therefore, be difficult to isolate from combinatorial phage libraries prepared from immunized mice without further specific modifications of the procedure added to maximize the probability of isolating scFvs against the desired antigen. To avoid these problems, a novel procedure was designed here with the purpose of maximizing the yield of anti-hCD13 scFv antibodies while avoiding the production of antibodies against other human cell surface antigens. Indeed, this procedure produced recombinant scFvs against human CD13 at high frequency. An advantage of the new procedure is that it does not require the extensive biochemical purification of the antigen, which can result in the partial or total loss of its native conformation. We anticipate that this procedure will be applicable to a number of other conformation-sensitive cell surface antigens.",

Shapiro, St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) harboring human CD13 cDNA (Look et al., 1989) was digested with SpeI/EcoRV and the insert was ligated to SpeI/EcoRV digested pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands), resulting in construct pcDNA-hCD13. For stable transfection of Sf21 cells, the EcoRV/NotI fragment of hCD13 cDNA was ligated into pIZT-V5-His (Invitrogen), resulting in pIZT-hCD13. To express soluble hCD13, a cDNA fragment lacking the transmembrane and intracellular domains was amplified by PCR from pIZT-hCD13. The primers used for this amplification were: CD13-Fc-EcoRV (5\u2032-tac gat atc aga aga aca aga acg cca ac-3\u2032) and CD13-Fc-NotI (5\u2032-ctg ggc ggc cgc tcg tgt ttt ctg tga acc ac-3\u2032).

Therefore, Sf21 insect cells were transfected with a cDNA construct coding for hCD13 and a mixture of stably transfected clones was used for the panning procedure. This mixture expressed hCD13 with sufficient stability as judged by flow cytometry and obviated the need for single cell subcloning. The mean fluorescence intensity of Sf21 cells stained with anti-CD13 antibody was \u223c50\u2013100 fold greater than the intensity of the same cells stained with an isotype-control antibody or that of non-transfected Sf21 cells (Fig. 1).",

Individually isolated phages were clonally purified and their specificity of binding was evaluated by cellular ELISA. As a result, 12 of 14 individually isolated phages from the third round of panning specifically reacted with NIH/3T3 cells stably expressing hCD13 and showed no binding to non-transfected NIH/3T3 cells (data not shown). Characterization of the cDNA inserts of these phages revealed that two different scFv clones, anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, were isolated multiple times independently, using both variants of the panning protocol. Both had identical light chain variable regions (VL), but differed in four amino acid positions of their heavy chain variable regions (VH). Two of these changes were located in the complementarity-determining regions 1 and 2 and the other two were found in framework 3 (Fig. 3\n).",

E. coli strain HB2151 was chosen for high level expression of the scFvs. Intact recombinant scFvs were secreted to the periplasmic compartment, as visualized by Western blot with an antibody reactive against the hexa-histidine tag (Fig. 4A\n, lane 2). No antigenic material was observed in the supernatant (Fig. 4, lane 1) or in periplasmic extracts from non-transformed E. coli HB2151 cells grown under the same conditions (Fig. 4, lane 3). A periplasmic extract from E. coli HB2151 harboring a nonrelevant scFv served as a positive control. From previous work (M. Peipp; unpublished observations), it was known that this latter scFv was efficiently secreted into the periplasmic space. Typically, 5\u20136 g of packed bacterial cells were obtained from a culture volume of 1 l, resulting in \u223c100\u2013150 \u03bcg of purified soluble scFv. The scFvs contained a hexa-histidine tag as a C-terminal extension, which allowed affinity purification with magnetic Ni-NTA beads. The protocol for the preparation of the periplasmic compartment and the purification with NTA beads was reduced to a one-step procedure resulting in the typical yield described above. The one-step purification procedure resulted in scFvs essentially free of contaminants detectable by staining with Coomassie blue (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Both purified soluble scFvs reacted with the hCD13 antigen on intact cells, as shown by FACS analysis (Fig. 5\n; data shown for scFv anti-hCD13-1), indicating that the two scFvs reacted with hCD13 in the native state.",

Therefore, to determine molecular binding constants for scFvs anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, it was necessary to generate the antigen in its native conformation and in a pure state. To achieve these objectives, the antigen was fused to the Fc-domain of a human IgG1 antibody, since this procedure was known to generate soluble antigens in a native conformation (M. Peipp, unpublished data). In this procedure, chimeric molecules are secreted from mammalian cells and receive the post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation) characteristic of mammalian cells. For the purpose of secretion, sequences coding for a leader peptide from a murine immunoglobulin \u03ba light chain were fused to the coding sequences for the extracellular domain of hCD13 (Fig. 6A\n). For the purpose of high level expression, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the construct and soluble human CD13 (s-hCD13) was then produced in high quantities for several days after transfection. The chimeric protein was collected from the culture supernatant and purified by affinity chromatography on a protein A agarose column. Using this procedure, typically 50-100 \u03bcg of the recombinant protein were recovered from 1 l of culture supernatant. The chimeric molecule reacted on a Western blot with an antibody against the Fc-portion (Fig. 6B), and no contaminants or breakdown products were visible by staining with Coomassie blue (Fig. 6C). The material reacted in an ELISA with the commercial anti-hCD13 (WM-47) antibody, as well as with the two isolated scFvs (data not shown). Thus, the integrity of the antigenic epitope in the chimeric s-hCD13 molecule resembled that on intact cells and this material was considered suitable as a ligand for the determination of molecular binding constants of the scFv antibodies.",

Sequential rounds of loading were performed until the total amount coupled corresponded to \u223c800 relative units (RU). Then the scFvs were allowed to flow over the chip in the fluid phase, and the association and dissociation reactions were monitored by surface plasmon resonance. This procedure allowed a reliable measurement of the association (k\na) and dissociation rate constants (k\nd). The affinity K\nD was determined for each scFv antibody from the quotient k\nd/k\na. The procedure was performed with several different concentrations of the same scFv in the fluid phase and with separate chips for anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3 (Fig. 7\n). Each scFv was also injected over a blank inactivated surface and this signal was subtracted from the signal obtained on the s-hCD13 surface to remove contribution from potential unspecific binding. The resulting affinities were 7.27\u00d710\u221210 M for anti-hCD13-1 and 32.9\u00d710\u221210 M for anti-hCD13-3, suggesting that anti-hCD13-3 had a lower affinity (Table 2\n). Therefore, the sequence differences in the VH regions of both scFvs may have resulted in measurably different affinities. The numerical values of the affinities were in the nanomolar range and below, which is typical for high affinity antibodies resulting from a secondary immunization (Griffiths et al., 1994). Thus, the novel procedure reported here was efficient in capturing scFvs with high affinities from immunized mice.",

In the majority of these cases, the libraries were panned subtractively with tumor- and non-tumor cell lines and the resulting scFvs were analyzed without prior knowledge of their identity and without specific features of the procedure designed to augment the efficiency of isolating antibodies against predetermined specific antigens. Only a few cases have been reported where scFvs against pre-selected specific cell surface antigens have been isolated by panning with intact cells (Portolano et al., 1993; Hoogenboom et al., 1999). The key feature of the procedure described here is the presentation of a defined single human antigen in its native state on membrane fragments purified from a transfected murine cell line. When membrane preparations from the hCD13-transfected NIH/3T3 cells were injected into recipient mice, we reasoned that the human CD13 antigen would be the major immunogenic molecule recognized by the immune system. A second important point was the screening strategy where hCD13 was the major common antigen between the material used for the immunization and the cells used for panning, allowing a more stringent positive selection on intact cells. To the best of our knowledge, a method employing a similar combination of steps has not been previously reported.",

            "text": "It is of interest to contrast the advantages and disadvantages of our procedure with those previously reported. One frequently employed method is the panning of complex non-immune (naive) or synthetic libraries (Griffiths et al., 1994, Vaughan et al., 1996, Knappik et al., 2000). The advantage of this procedure is that one universal library can be used to screen for scFvs reacting with many different antigens (Nissim et al., 1994). Synthetic libraries do not necessarily represent the naive repertoire, but often also contain high affinity scFvs because generation of these libraries includes hypermutation of the CDR3 region. Such libraries have been expanded to considerable complexity and libraries containing up to 109\u20131011 different scFvs have been reported (Vaughan et al., 1996, Knappik et al., 2000). One disadvantage of this approach is that the libraries, in spite of hypermutated CDR3 regions, have not been isolated from animals undergoing a secondary or tertiary immune response against a specific antigen. Although high affinity scFvs have been isolated using this approach, the probability of finding scFvs against a specific antigen is reduced, entailing the need to screen a large library of 109\u20131011 different clones (Perelson, 1989). Another disadvantage is that the isolation of specific binders to a defined antigen on the cell surface may be compromised using non-immune or synthetic libraries, because it has been reported that non-immune antibody libraries contain binders to dominant epitopes (Noronha et al., 1998, Hoogenboom et al., 1999). The binders to dominant epitopes may be preferentially amplified during screening and decrease the probability of isolating the desired binders to specific, predetermined antigens, especially when screening is performed using complex antigens, such as whole cells. In our procedure, mice were immunized with a specific antigen (hCD13) and then given multiple boosts until a secondary and possibly even a tertiary immune response was well underway. This strategy increased the likelihood of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo and subsequent isolation of high affinity antibodies against hCD13. Furthermore, two different scFvs reacting specifically with hCD13 were obtained after screening a library of only 106 clones. Thus, the strategy described here allowed us to isolate high affinity scFvs against our antigen of choice from comparatively small libraries. The procedure should be useful for the preparation of scFvs against other conformation-sensitive cell surface antigens, for which cloned cDNA is available.",

Existing procedures involving subtractive whole cell-panning without the labor-intensive refinements added here may be sufficient or superior for this purpose. In addition, the scFvs isolated here are murine scFvs, with known disadvantages when used in human clinical applications. Although some of these disadvantages can be relieved by chimerizing or humanizing the murine scFvs, it may still be preferable for a majority of clinical applications to generate human scFvs from the beginning. Finally, we do not wish to detract from the major advantage of large combinatorial or synthetic naive human scFv-libraries. Clearly, their major advantage is, that from one library human scFvs against many different antigens can be isolated without the need for prior immunization. For a majority of general applications these existing procedures may be equal or superior to the procedure reported here. The strength of the novel procedure specifically lies in the generation of recombinant scFvs against conformation sensitive antigens, such as CD13, for which cDNAs are available, but for which no recombinant scFvs have previously been obtained, that recognize the antigen in its native state on intact cells. In this case, the advantage of our procedure is, that it avoids the need for an extensive biochemical purification of the antigen, which may destroy the conformation-sensitive epitope. This epitope may only exist when the antigen is present in its native conformation on the cell surface and may disappear when it is purified away from its nearest neighbor membrane components. For this narrow segment of applications, the procedure reported here presents significant progress, as demonstrated for the example of CD13, for which no scFvs had previously been isolated, that recognized the antigen in its native state.",

Their affinities were high in comparison with published values (Griffiths et al., 1994). Antibodies with affinities in the nanomolar range or higher are high affinity antibodies (Vaughan et al., 1996). However, caution must be exerted when comparing the numbers obtained here with previously published figures, since different measurement procedures were utilized. In our case, soluble scFvs were used that were monovalent and association and dissociation rate constants were measured by surface plasmon resonance. In this method, one of the two binding partners was immobilized (in the solid phase); the other was freely mobile in the fluid phase. Reactions with immobilized partners have different kinetic parameters compared with reactions where both interacting partners remain in the fluid phase (Nieba et al., 1996). Furthermore, many published affinity constants were obtained by measurement procedures in which both the antibody and ligand were in fluid phase. Therefore, the numerical affinity values reported here are not strictly comparable to previously published values and are not intended to represent absolute values. They must be considered approximate values. With this proviso they indicate that scFvs of high affinity have been isolated by our procedure.",

These purposes include human cell- and tissue-typing (Goyert, 1997) and the intervention against cytomegalovirus including the removal of hCD13-positive cells from transplants in order to reduce the likelihood of transmission of hCMV with the transplant (Larsson et al., 1998). These scFvs may also become useful in the design of novel therapeutic approaches against human cancers aimed at interfering with angiogenesis (Pasqualini et al., 2000). Anti-hCD13 antibodies have been used successfully by other authors in a mouse model as active agents against HL60 myeloid leukemia cells (Xu and Scheinberg, 1995). While it is clear that scFvs of murine origin represent problems in human clinical applications, they may still be clinically useful, as demonstrated by antibodies against human CD20, that have recently been approved as human therapeutical agents and that were derived from murine monoclonal antibodies. In our perspective, these scFvs and the corresponding cDNAs may become valuable for the design of novel therapeutic strategies against t(4;11) and t(11;19) leukemia cells.",
