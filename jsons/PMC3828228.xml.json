As of May 15, WHO reported a global total of 40 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with MERS-CoV, including 20 deaths, in 6 countries: Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Kingdom. So far, those who were infected with MERS-CoV had either lived in or visited the Middle-East.

For instance, it is currently known that MERS-CoV is not as infectious as SARS-CoV in terms of human to human transmission.3 On the other hand, MERS-CoV is more virulent than SARS-CoV. Infection with MERS-CoV, unlike SARS, often comes with multiple organ failures,2 including rapid kidney failure. The receptor responsible for viral-entry in the case of MERS-CoV has been found to be different from that of SARS-CoV. There are still many questions related to MERS-CoV/HCoV-EMC that need to be answered.

That paper described a model developed by measuring predicted disorder of two shells proteins of coronaviruses. The model grouped the analyzed viruses by the hardness of their shells. The categorization was found to be correlated with the various transmission modes. For example, the SARS-CoV was found to have moderate levels of disorder suggesting that it belonged to the category B, which explained the virus\u2019s moderate ability to spread via respiratory mode but yet having sufficiently large \u201coral-fecal\u201d component to last outside the physiological environment for a reasonably long period of time. The immediate question that then arises is: Where does MERS-CoV stand in this case? As a result of the recent availability of protein sequence data for this virus, we are able to report on its categorization and the potential implications of this categorization based on the analysis of the propensity of viral proteins for intrinsic disorder. Here, we applied the model that was developed and described in the previous paper4 to the MERS-CoV to provide a glimpse into the evolutionary nature of this virus using protein intrinsic disorder at its shell as a dissecting tool.",

The availability of MERS-CoV genetic and protein sequence information made it possible to evaluate the PID levels of its M- and N-proteins. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1, which suggests that MERS-CoV falls into the disorder group C, which includes coronaviruses with higher oral-fecal component.

In fact, there is a close similarity between the N-terminal halves of the IBV and MERS-CoV N-proteins, whereas the C-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV N-protein is strikingly similar to the C-terminal domain of the Bat-HKU5 N-protein.

An entirely different approach has been described in our previous paper.4 It involves examining the hardness of the viral shells.

SARS-CoV is thus analyzed as having moderate oral-fecal and respiratory transmission. Signs of higher respiratory transmission were detected by the model in coronaviruses such as IBV and HCoV-229E (group A), but such higher levels of respiratory transmission could not be detected in SARS-CoV, and, even less so, in MERS-CoV.

This hypothesis is not only supported but it also explains much of the perplexing data pertaining to MERS-CoV. For example, it was not clear why the SARS-CoV spread relatively easily when someone is infected, whereas, in the case of MERS-CoV, fewer people in contact with the infected individuals became infected themselves. Our model explains that the evolution of MERS-CoV is such that it facilitates a larger oral-fecal transmission potential for its survival, but SARS-CoV, on the other hand, needs a larger respiratory transmission level and lower oral-fecal transmission to be successful, with the respiratory and oral-fecal routs of the SARS-CoV transmission still being relatively moderate. We will see that the higher oral-fecal potential of MERS-CoV explains much of the underlying reasons for its virulence, its high adaptability to a broad range of animal hosts, and its apparent lack (or at least highly diminished efficiency) of human-human transmission in comparison with SARS-CoV.",

As seen in Table 1 and Figure 1, while PEDV resembles more SARS-CoV in its shell disorder (PID: 51% for N and 8% for M in PEDV vs. 50% for N and 8% for M in SARS-CoV), TGEV (PID: 43% for N and 14% for M) resembles MERS-CoV (PID: 43% for N and 9% for M) especially with regard to the amount of disorder in their N-proteins. This similarity gives some hints on the behavior of MERS-CoV, where this virus was able to infect animals possessing behaviors that confer advantage to the virus in its oral-fecal spread, and the virus was thus able to spread rapidly. It should be reminded that higher oral-fecal transmission means higher chances of infection via close contacts and touch.69 The inherent behaviors of a wide variety of animals are likely to confer larger advantages to such viruses with larger oral-fecal transmission. We will see later that this factor has implications for the evolution of virus in acquisition of its adaptability to cells of a wide variety of animals.",

Firstly, we need to bear in mind that even TGEV is known to have some fecal-respiratory potential.70\n,\n71 There is however, a difference with regard to MERS-CoV: It has a harder outer shell (PID of 9% in M-protein) than that of TEGV (M-protein has PID of 14%).

The answer is that apparently TGEV does not need to survive in the external environment for long since it spreads very rapidly among pigs4 and having a more disordered shells has been known to offer viruses ways to evade the immune systems.50 This softness seen in the M-protein of TGEV could not be detected in the MERS-CoV, which has a PID of 9%.

Given the hard encasement of MERS-CoV detected by the model, there is no reason to dismiss this as a possibility either as a major or minor route of transmission since oral-urine transmission often entails the virus to remain in the external environment for extended period. Besides, virus has to enter the gastro-intestinal regions, where it is exposed to digestive acid and enzymes, before reaching the renal-urinary tract.",

            "text": "An interesting and related note is the fact that the other known coronavirus that causes renal-failure is avian IBV. The puzzling fact here is that the model has put IBV to be in group A, which is listed as having highest preference for respiratory transmission alongside HCoV-229E. However, IBV, unlike 229E, has a hard outer shell with its M-protein possessing PID of 9.8%, which is comparable to that of MERS-CoV (9.1%) even though IBV has a highly disordered inner shell (its N-protein has a PID of 56%) just like HCoV-229E. This may signify the presence of high urine-respiratory transmission in the case of IBV. The similarity in the PID scores for IBV and MERS-CoV M-proteins could reflect the need of both viral particles to remain in the environment for at least a reasonable period of time. It should also be kept in mind that while oral-fecal mode is an important mean for a virus to spread rapidly in many animals such as swine, higher respiratory transmission may be crucial for a virus to be highly infectious in birds as seen not just in IBV but also in viruses such as influenza A H5N1. There may also be advantages in transmission via urine by flying animals such as birds and bats since the fluid released during flight could provide wider contamination of areas with vegetations, possible nesting areas and edible fruits.",

            "text": "Just as we have seen that there are reasons to look into the possibility of oral-urine spread for MERS-CoV, there are also reasons to look into the possibility of MERS-CoV to be transmitted via saliva. Many viruses that have known association with oral-fecal transmission are also known to spread by oral-saliva routs (e.g., hantavirus and Nipah virus). In the case of Nipah virus, humans get infected after consuming raw fruits that were previously eaten by infected bats. Since MERS-CoV has the ability to infect bats and since of its close relatives, bat HKU4 and HKU5, are viruses infecting bats and flying foxes, the oral-saliva route needs to be scrutinized. Several factors that have been detected by the model allow us to believe that the transmission of MERS-CoV by saliva is quite possible. The first has to do with the fact that MERS-CoV is categorized into disorder group C. Another involves the prediction that its outer shell is hard. Related to these, it has been found that viruses that are in close contact with saliva are usually accompanied by a hard rigid shell as previously detected by disorder predictors, e.g. rabies (unpublished data from database mentioned in previous papers)50 and EIAV.49\n,\n50 These observations are consistent with the biochemistry of saliva since salivary enzymes, that include glycosidases and proteases, can damage the surface proteins and shells proteins found in the virion surface.74 Therefore, a hard shell is necessary to protect the virion from such damage especially if the virus has to remain in the saliva for a longer period.",

An interpretation of this is that bat coronaviruses have the best fitness when they have a specific level of respiratory and oral-fecal transmission as dictated by the inherent nature of bats, but the viruses may vary in their ability to survive outside as seen by the varying hardness of the outer shell reflected in the disorder of their M-proteins. Interestingly, the level of disorder for the shell proteins of MERS-CoV is lower than that of HKU4/5, especially for the N-protein.

On the other hand, experimental data show that the virus is highly adapted to cell-lines from a diverse range of animals including humans. By detecting a higher oral-fecal levels of transmission, the model is able to link the data coming from various sources. While having an oral-fecal transmission mode may have allowed the virus to enter into and move rapidly among a large number of animal species and thereby, acquiring its adaptability, it can also become or remain highly virulent in some species since the oral-fecal route acts as a natural barrier to quick transmission in those species. Evidence of this hypothesis can be seen in commonness of high virulence found in many viral diseases that rely largely on oral-fecal transmission for spread.",

Given the high pathogenicity of the virus, such an extrapolation must be made at the individual researcher\u2019s own risk and should not be used as an excuse to let our vigilance down against the possibility of a SARS-like outbreak. There are several complex reasons for this. In order to make predictions with full confidence, one needs to assume that the model used has incorporated entity\u2019s entire past. Unfortunately, such completeness is impossible in any model and the best that a model can offer is to provide a glimpse of an entity\u2019s past, in this case, the evolutionary past of MERS-CoV. Furthermore, it should be reminded that many coronaviruses in disorder group C still have adequate respiratory components to be, at least, troublesome. An example is HKU1, which is known to spread widely among children since children are in environments where contacts and touch assist the transmission.82 Lastly, many viruses, such as Nipah virus, hantaviruses, and Ebola virus,76\n,\n77 that rely heavily on the oral/fecal/urine route are capable of repeated comebacks over decades in terms of causing outbreaks in humans, since, like MERS-CoV, they are highly adapted, and many have no lack of potential animal reservoirs, even if they are temporary. Over time, the death tolls arising from the repeated outbreaks may exceed that of a pandemic or epidemic. Obviously, there is no way for anyone to be certain if this will be the case for MERS-CoV, but it is a possibility to look out for.",
