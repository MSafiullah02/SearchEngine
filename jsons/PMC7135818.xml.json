Symptoms can intensify to include chest pain and dyspnea [2], [6], frequently resulting in patients seeking medical attention at the peak of their infectivity. Transmission remains sporadic among humans, and true incidence is unknown at the present time. However, if individuals are infected, the current case-fatality rate for avian flu is thought to be greater than 50% in humans [2] and greater than 90% in birds and other mammals.

Although human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus remains sporadic [7], [8], the virus has the potential to transform itself into subtypes for which little immunity exists. Genetic reassortment can also occur when one individual is simultaneously infected with both the rare H5N1 virus and with another, more common human subtype. The result is a subtype that lacks innate immunity but possesses a high degree of transmissibility to humans. Although H5N1 has shown no human reassortment to date, the potential for pandemic spread exists if more effective, sustained human transmission occurs. Similar scenarios were seen in the other influenza pandemics: Asian flu (H2N2) in 1957 and Hong Kong flu (H3N2) in 1968, whose combined death toll was greater than 100 000 deaths in the United States alone [9].",

Common signs and symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, sore throat, cough, and rhinitis. Although less common, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms have also been reported.

In Singapore, at the height of the SARS epidemic, medical providers modified their infection-control procedures to better contain nosocomial spread of the virus [14]. In addition to wearing standard PPE, providers wore disposable hats, disposable shoe covers, and positive air-powered respirators. Staff were trained on the need for this awkward uncomfortable equipment. Operating suites were also specially modified to decrease the spread of the infection, and traffic flow was reduced by cancelled elective surgeries. Operating rooms (ORs) with positive pressure and at least 25 exchanges per hour were designated to be used. Whenever possible, ORs with separate air-conditioning and humidification systems were selected. Airflow outside these rooms was limited; all doors except for one were closed and sealed with tape to minimize personal movement. After each procedure with a known infectious patient, the OR was decontaminated and the air was allowed to circulate for at least 1 hour. All nondisposable equipment was double-bagged, with the inner biodegradable bag inserted directly into the sterilizer.",

The most senior anesthesiologist inserted tracheal tubes. In all cases, muscle relaxants where used to minimize the duration of the procedure and the risk for further spreading infected secretions by coughing [15]. The use of regional anesthesia and avoidance of airway manipulation in the case of infected patients requiring surgical procedures are also recommended [16]. When general anesthesia was required, hydrophobic filters were placed on both the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the anesthesia circuit. These filters, the gas, or end-tidal carbon dioxide sampling line, and the trap were discarded after each case. Instrumentation of the airway, if necessary, was performed using either a cuffed endotracheal tube or a laryngeal mask airway [16]. In the Toronto outbreak of SARS, anesthesiologists also used mechanically powered, air-purifying respirators and double-gloving techniques with decontamination between removals of each layer of PPE. Some infection-control questions were not specifically addressed but desire consideration. Should rolls of tape be disposed between cases? What are the proper procedures to disinfect touch-screen monitors and equipment? What personal items, beepers, laptops, PDAs, pens, etc, are allowed in a contaminated OR? What have we learned from the recent epidemics?",
