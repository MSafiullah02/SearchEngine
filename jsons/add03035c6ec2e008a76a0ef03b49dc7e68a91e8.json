The common indications for it in our center are Cancer of larynx or hypopharynx, resulting in stridor, Laryngeal edema due to radiation, and Bilateral vocal cord fixation in the midline (adducted cords) due to post-cricoid cancers or abductor paralysis in post thyroidectomy patients. In the present situation of the COVID-19 Pandemic, it is advisable to avoid all aerosol-generating procedures. Tracheostomy is a highly aerosolgenerating procedure, which warrants temporary modifications in its approach during an emergency [1, 2, 3, 4 ].",

As soon as we decided to do tracheostomy, the Operating Theatre(OT) staff were alerted to prepare the OT. In all the cases, we took radiographs of chest and neck for its anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views, and an appropriate dose of steroid was given to support the patient till the surgical airway was created. Although these procedures should be ideally performed in negative pressure ORs [1] ,this was not feasible in our hands due to resource limitations. Hence all cases were performed in an OR with a closed door, and before the patient reached the OR, the surgical and anesthetic teams were donned with PPE, including an N95 mask and a face shield. Buddy check was performed to ensure completeness of donning.",

We believe that the most crucial factor in minimizing a COVID infection risk is to reduce the duration of exposure to aerosolized secretions intraoperatively. This was achieved by the surgeon's expertise, wherein the average incision to cuff inflation time remained less than 5 minutes. The most critical challenge while performing a tracheostomy with a PPE is fogging, which may lead to discomfort to the surgeon and prolongation of the procedure. To an extent, anti-fogging solutions may help, but in such a situation, again it is the experience of the surgeon that counts the most since he or she engaged in a problematic situation of fogging uses two more senses i.e. proprioception to palpate the trachea at every step and cognition to listen and respond to the anesthesia machine and fed backs from the anesthesia colleague for any fall in saturation.",
