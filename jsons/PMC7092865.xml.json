Since SUD does not seem to differentiate between DNA and RNA, the availability of potential binding sites will depend on the sub-cellular localization of the protein. Oligo(dG) sequences, so called G-strings, have been identified as binding sites for transcription factors in eukaryotic cells [19], [20]. Since there is no evidence for a nuclear localization of Nsp3 in the host cell [8], [14], we focused on potential cytosolic interaction partners. Oligo(G) sequences are found in 3\u2032-UTRs of several mRNAs including the mRNA for the human pro-apoptotic protein Bbc3 (Accession No. U82987; [21]), the transcript variant 1 of the mRNA for the human MAP kinase 1 (NM_002745), the mRNA for the human RAB6B protein, a member of the Ras oncogene family (NM_016577), and the mRNA for TAB3, a component of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (NM_152787). These proteins are prime candidates for an interference of the virus with cellular signaling pathways. Changes in the stability and/or translation efficiency of these mRNAs due to the binding of a regulatory factor should result in an altered response of the infected cell to extracellular signals.",

As a control for the specificity of the RNA\u2013protein interaction, an RNA probe (bbc3-A14) containing an A14-string instead of G14 was prepared in a similar manner. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to probe the interaction between SUD proteins and RNAs. To prevent non-specific binding of radioactive RNA probes to the proteins, a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled tRNA was added to the reaction mixtures. As can be seen from Fig. 4\nA, full-length SUD is able to retard the mobility of the radioactive bbc3-G14 RNA in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 1\u20134). An anti-Nsp3 antibody that had been tested for specific interaction with SUD (see Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6), but not an irrelevant anti-T7 RNA polymerase antibody, supershifts the migration of the SUD\u2013RNA complex (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8, respectively), implying direct and highly specific interaction between SUD and bbc3-G14. Both full-length SUD (Fig. 4A, lanes 2\u20134 and 6) and SUDc5b (Fig. 4B, lane 1) are able to retard the electrophoretic mobility of free bbc3-G14 RNA due to RNA\u2013protein complex formation. In contrast, bbc3-A14 RNA is unable to form a similar complex either with full-length SUD (Fig. 4B, lane 4) or with SUDc5b (Fig. 4B, lane 5), thus confirming the specificity of the RNA\u2013protein interaction. Interestingly, the appearance of an additional, extremely slow-migrating band was observed with SUDc5b and bbc3-G14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 1, asterisk), but not with bbc3-A14 RNA (lane 5). This is possibly due to a multimerization of a specific RNA\u2013protein complex. The ability of SUDc5b to form multimers in presence of (dG)8 was confirmed by dynamic light-scattering (Fig. S3B). No interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA), included as a further control of specificity, with bbc3-G14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 2) or with bbc3-A14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 6) was detectable.",

It is conceivable that binding of SUD to these RNAs will result in an alteration of their stability, or translation efficiency, as it has been demonstrated for eukaryotic trans-acting factors such as HuR, CP1, and TIA-1 [23], [24], [25], [26], and thereby will interfere with cellular signal transduction. Bbc3 is a pro-apoptotic protein that is induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli. It is subject to transcriptional regulation by multiple cell death-signaling pathways [21] and has been demonstrated to mediate apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells [27]. Blocking Bbc3 production at the translation level could override the transcriptional activation and render a cell less sensitive to apoptotic signals. Similarly, an interaction of SUD with the TAB3 mRNA may contribute to the recently described NF-\u03baB activation and the increased CXCL10 (interferon \u03b3-inducible protein 10) levels observed in the blood of SARS patients [28]. In addition to the spike, nucleocapsid, Orf3b, Orf6, Orf7a, and PL2pro proteins [12], [28], SUD could thus be another component of SARS-CoV involved in the modulation of host-cell signaling pathways.",
