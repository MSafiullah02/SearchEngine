The panel was presented a web-based questionnaire that included clinical scenarios specific to IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was created and iteratively improved by three of the authors (DTR, MTA, CAS) and then distributed electronically to the respondents. The panelists included the membership of IOIBD in addition to other invited specialists in IBD. Respondents rated each of the patient scenarios on a scale of 1 to 9, such that statements rated 1-3 are considered inappropriate, 4-6 are uncertain, and 7-9 are appropriate. After the first round of anonymous voting, the first webinar occurred and related content was reviewed as summarized above and the results of the first round of voting were reviewed. The subsequent discussion focused on scenarios that had a median in the uncertainty range and those with a high standard deviation (SD). The goal of the discussion was to understand views of the panel in preparation for a second round of voting, not necessarily to achieve consensus. The second round questionnaire was nearly identical to the first, except for clarifying a few of the original scenarios and adding two additional sections that were not covered in round one (how to manage patients in IBD clinical trials and when to restart medications if they were being held for active COVID-19 infection). Table 1 is a list of the statements from the second round of voting. The final appropriateness category is based on the second-round voting median. The mean, standard deviation (SD) and disagreement index (DI) were also calculated.",

However, important for IBD, the small intestine is also known to express ACE-2; in a patient that was infected with SARS-CoV-2, ACE-2 and the virus were found in stomach, duodenal, and rectal biopsies. 7 Moreover, single cell transcriptomics of the gut, corroborate that ACE-2 is expressed in the GI tract. 8 The virus has also been found in stool of infected patients for longer periods of time than in sputum, although in smaller amounts. 9",

In terms of the therapies we use for IBD and the potential effect on SARS-CoV2, previous experience with high dose steroids as a treatment for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was not effective and delayed viral clearance. 12 Therefore, steroids are not recommended as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, but the doses that were used in these studies are much higher than the doses that are used in IBD. 12 With respect to thiopurines, 6-MP and 6-thioguanine have potential antiviral activity against MERS and SARS, at least in vitro. 13 Many IBD patients are using monotherapy with biologics or the novel small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, tofacitinib. Anti-TNF therapy may impact viral immunity given that there is a small increased risk of herpes zoster and hepatitis B virus reactivation. While high IL-2R and IL-6 serum levels have been associated with severe COVID-19 cases, no effect on TNF levels was noted. 16 IFN-\u03b3 and TNF production by CD4+ T cells have been associated with severe SARS-CoV and, therefore, inhibition of TNF has been proposed as a treatment of the cytokine release syndrome that can occur in some of these patients. 17, 18 Vedolizumab primarily inhibits \u03b1-4, \u03b2-7 lymphocyte homing of Th17 and Th9 cells as well as regulatory T cells to the intestine. Viral infections are rare with vedolizumab therapy. 19 In patients who had concurrent hepatitis B or C infection, there was no viral reactivation and there was sustained virologic control in SIV-infected macaques after antiretroviral and vedolizumab therapy 20 Vedolizumab has been used for clinical therapy in patients with IBD and early clinical trials in HIV have not shown effects on viral load. 21 With respect to ustekinumab, this agent can prevent Th1+ T cell priming and IFN-\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells and suppress Th17+ T cell activation and cytokine production. There has been no increase in viral infections in IBD or psoriasis patients receiving ustekinumab in large post-marketing registries. 22 Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6R antibody, is currently being tested in patients with severe COVID-19 and may reduce the severity of ARDS. 23 ",

Unfortunately, patients with lymphopenia caused by SARS-CoV-2 have a worse prognosis and have an increased risk of death associated with the virus. 14,15 At the current time there are no specific data available on methotrexate and COVID-19, but in theory the pulmonary toxicity of methotrexate may be of interest in the setting of a virus that involves the respiratory tract.",

Thus, tofacitinib might inhibit viral immunity, but on the other hand, it might help with the severe inflammatory response that ultimately leads to death. In certain studies, tofacitinib can inhibit interferon secretion.When considering management of IBD medications, one must also take into account the half-life of the drugs. In general, five and a half half-lives are required to achieve very low levels of drug. Corticosteroids have a half-life of about 24 hours, but it is dosedependent and the higher the dose, the longer the biological effect. Thiopurines have been studied in IBD patients and the median 6-thioguanine elimination half-life is 6.8 days with very low levels of 6-thioguanine present by 40 days.25 Studies of vaccine responses in patients on thiopurines demonstrate that patients were able to mount normal immune responses.26  Methotrexate has a six-hour half-life and takes less than three days to eliminate. Tofacitinib has a half-life of between three to six hours depending on whether it is immediate or extended-release.27  Studies in normal volunteers treated with tofacitinib, however, found defects in immune function for a month after drug withdrawal.28  For the subcutaneous and IV-based biologics, the half-life is much longer. The half-life of adalimumab is between 10 and 20 days while the half-life of infliximab is between is 7 to 12 days. The median half-life for ustekinumab is approximately 19 days in patients with CD while the serum half-life of vedolizumab is 25 days. Thus, even after cessation of these immune therapies, there may be continued effects on the patient and implications for the infection.",
