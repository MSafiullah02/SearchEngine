In normal rabbits with no ocular or respiratory disease, the most frequently isolated organisms from the conjunctival cul de sac include Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bordetella species, and Pasteurella species. However, Pasteurella multocida is a cause of conjunctivitis, epiphora, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and dacryocystitis in rabbits.24 Other infectious agents that have been associated with conjunctivitis in rabbits include S. aureus, Pseudomonas species. Haemophilus species, Treponema paraluiscuniculi, mycoplasma, chlamydiae, and myxoma virus. In a colony of rabbits with chronic conjunctivitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, nonhemolytic Escherichia coli, Coynebacterium pyogenes, Haemophilus species, Neisseria species, and Lactobacillus species were isolated from conjunctival samples. Mucopurulent conjunctivitis and blepharitis with corneal ulceration have been associated with S. aureus infection in a rabbit.28 Treatment with topical gentamicin ophthalmic ointment and systemic gentamicin was curative. Other causes of conjunctivitis in rabbits include foreign bodies, entropion, distichia, trichiasis, and high ammonia or dust content in the environment. Dental disease, including root elongation and dental abscesses, is also associated with conjunctivitis.",

The discharge often has a white, gritty appearance and may be intermittent and resistant to treatment with topical antibiotics. Root elongation of the maxillary incisors is a common underlying cause.16 The elongated roots can cause an obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct at its flexure just caudal to the roots of the incisors. Radiographs of the skull are needed to assess the incisors; excess curvature of the incisor roots is abnormal. In one report describing two affected rabbits, radiographs revealed a cystic dilation of the nasolacrimal duct immediately caudal to the duct flexure, and the incisors were more arched than in normal rabbits.24 Irrigation of the nasolacrimal system in affected rabbits yielded opaque, white, gritty fluid. On cytologic examination, numerous macrophages, lipid-laden mesothelial cells, lipid droplets, and small numbers of bacteria and erythrocytes were present. The fluid cleared when ether was added, suggesting the presence of triglycerides or cholesterol. However, the role of lipid secretion in the pathogenesis of the obstruction was unknown. Bacteriologic culture of fluids used to irrigate the nasolacrimal ducts of both normal and affected rabbits yielded similar bacterial isolates; therefore, microorganisms apparently are not important in the pathogenesis of epiphora in rabbits. Bacterial isolates included Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Moraxella, and Neisseria species; Oligella urethralis, Streptococcus viridans, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Inflammation was present in the nasolacrimal system of one rabbit.",

After instilling a topical ophthalmic anesthetic, use a 23-gauge lacrimal cannula or a 24-gauge Teflon intravenous catheter to flush the duct (Fig. 39-2\n). Recurrence of the obstruction is common, and duct irrigation may need to be repeated every 2 to 3 days or weekly until a few consecutive clear irrigations are obtained. If topical antibiotic therapy is used, a broad-spectrum medication such as triple antibiotic solution is recommended. Topical nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory ophthalmic medications, such as 0.03% flurbiprofen or 1% diclofenac, may help minimize irritation caused by the procedure. In rabbits with chronic or severe infections, concurrent topical ophthalmic and systemic antibiotic therapy may be needed. Suggested combinations include systemic enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer Corporation, Shawnee Mission, KS) and topical ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan, Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) or gentamicin. In rabbits with evidence of underlying incisor root elongation, removal of the incisors can be considered in severe cases.",

Ophthalmic examination reveals a circular membrane that originates at the limbus (the junction of the cornea and sclera) and gradually advances over the cornea. In severe cases, only a small central opening is present, allowing visibility of an otherwise normal globe. The membrane does not adhere to the cornea. The cause of this condition is unknown, although trauma has been suggested. Progressive membranous occlusion in rabbits has been compared with pterygium in humans. However, in humans the membrane is triangular and adherent to the cornea, whereas in rabbits it is nonadherent and circumferential from the limbus. Treatment with topical antibiotic or antibiotic-steroid medications has no effect. Surgically resecting the membrane and treating with topical antibiotics after surgery usually result in quick recurrence of the membrane. However, resecting the membrane a few millimeters beyond the limbus and treating with a topical antibiotic-steroid combination after surgery may prevent recurrence. Good results have also been obtained with surgical resection and the use of topical cyclosporine. Another described surgical technique is to incise the membrane into four quarters and suture each quadrant of the membrane to the inside of the eyelids.35 With this technique, recurrence may be prevented for at least 1 year.",

Many rabbits infected with E. cuniculi are asymptomatic, but neurologic signs can include convulsions, tremors, torticollis, paresis, and coma. Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection has also been associated with phacoclastic uveitis. In one report, examination of phacofragmentation fluid from a rabbit revealed the presence of E. cuniculi DNA.38 Most affected rabbits are young (less than 2 years), and dwarf rabbits appear predisposed to disease. Clinically, a white mass is often seen protruding into the anterior chamber (Fig. 39-4\n). Careful examination of the anterior segment of the eye with slit lamp biomicroscopy may reveal a break in the anterior lens capsule. The break is frequently hidden by inflammatory material and it may appear as if only the iris is involved in the inflammatory process. A focal cataract is often present in the area of the anterior lens capsule break. Signs of a severe pyogranulomatous anterior uveitis are usually present, such as conjunctival hyperemia, a swollen hyperemic iris, miosis, aqueous flare, and low intraocular pressure. The posterior segment of the eye is initially normal; however, if left untreated, severe uveitis and cataract formation can lead to blindness and possible phthisis bulbi or glaucoma. An abscess in the iris caused by P. multocida initially may resemble phacoclastic uveitis. Measuring serum antibody titers for E. cuniculi and P. multocida may aid in the differential diagnosis. Treatment of choice is surgical removal of the lens by phacofragmentation. Because of the rabbit's ability to regenerate a lens after this procedure, inserting an artificial lens after phacofragmentation is not recommended. Systemic treatment of E. cuniculi with albendazole (30 mg/kg PO q24h for 30 days, then 15 mg/kg PO q24h for an additional 30 days) has been reported.38 More recently, fenbendazole (20 mg/kg q24h for 28 days) has proved effective in both preventing experimental E. cuniculi infection in rabbits and treating naturally infected, seropositive rabbits.39 If the lens is not removed surgically, control of the uveitis with topical steroidal (such as 1% prednisolone acetate) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well as systemic fenbendazole or albendazole is necessary. Enucleation may be indicated if the uveitis cannot be controlled medically and a chronic painful eye is present.46\n",

Ophthalmic examination of 6000 Sprague-Dawley rats revealed a focal linear retinopathy in 3% and a fundic coloboma in 0.5% of animals examined.18 Spontaneous corneal degeneration has been described in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats,4 and corneal dystrophy has been described in Fischer 344 rats.22 Experimental infections also lead to ophthalmic abnormalities. Blepharitis with crust formation in the medial canthus and partial periocular alopecia were observed in mice experimentally infected with Trypanosoma brucei.36\n",

Sialodacryoadenitis virus is a highly contagious coronavirus that replicates in the respiratory tract epithelium, causing rhinotracheitis, bronchitis, and alveolitis. The virus also causes sialoadenitis of the submandibular and parotid salivary glands and necrotizing dacryoadenitis of orbital and harderian lacrimal glands. Exophthalmos, epiphora, and keratoconjunctivitis may result. The infection usually resolves within 1 week in immunocompetent animals. In a study of athymic rats, infection persisted for more than 3 months, indicating that normal T-cell function is required for host defenses against the virus.42 Infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus may also result in uveitis and multifocal retinal degeneration.20 Complications from infection include corneal opacification, anterior and posterior synechiae, cataract, and glaucoma. Specific therapy is not available, and treatment is supportive only. Other causes for red tears include infection with parainfluenza virus type 3 or Sendai virus as well as pain or stress. Ammonia vapor from soiled bedding can act as an ocular irritant, predisposing animals to secondary infection. Keeping the housing areas well ventilated is important in preventing infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus.",
