The Biological Weapon Convention (BWC) was established in 1972, banning the development, production and stockpiling of microorganisms and toxins that can lead to mass destruction. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention classified bioterrorism agents into three major categories: Category A, B and C. The categorization depends upon the following criteria: (1) the easy dissemination (person-to-person) of biologically active infectious agents, (2) a major public health concern and causing a high case fatality rate both in humans and/or livestock, and (3) the creation of panic and terror among people [1].",

            "text": "Prior to the development of high-end diagnostic tools, basic microscopy techniques used to be a primary tool in the diagnosis of disease. Microscopy played a pivotal role in diagnosis of bacterial pathogens and helped to enumerate pathogens in different samples (e.g., blood, urine, sputum, stool). Different stains (e.g., gram-stain, Rhodamine, Indian ink) on histopathological specimens differentiated and classified several bacterial strains. The non-cultivable viruses, like rotaviruses, hepatitis A virus, and Norwalk virus, were also identified through microscopic techniques. Diagnosis was based on the morphological features of bacteria and virus particles, which required large amounts of samples, In the case of viruses, a high viral titer (105 to 106 virus particles/ml) was needed. In addition, sample losses were high during sample preparation (electron microscopy, EM), either due to sample dehydration or charging of biomolecules (bacteria and viruses), which used to result in reduced contrast and performance. Further, microscopic techniques required expertise and trained manpower. Advancement in the technology led to the development of transmission electron cryomicroscopy, for which specimens are preserved at \u2212150 \u00b0C for maintaining the amorphous texture and for avoiding any ice-crystal damage. Nonetheless, the technique requires a high amount of sample (~1 mg/ml of virus particles). In addition, bacteria are far too thick for transmission electron cryomicroscopy to allow resolution of structural details [2\u20134]. The amalgamation of EM with cell culture practices greatly contributed in the diagnosis of bacterial and viral pathogens.",

With different types of immuno-based and chip-based biosensors, biothreat agents are quickly and sensitively detected. Scientists are encouraged to use nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), for real-time detection of DNA and RNA using fluorescent dyes through multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, in which multiple pathogens can be diagnosed in a single run. PCR amplification cannot produce a large amount of high-throughput data, but next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms provide an unbiased-in depth analysis of near-complete genomes. Molecular diagnostic techniques (Microarrays, PCR and NGS) are time saving and precise in the detection and discovery of micro-organisms in a given sample. Development of quantitative, multiplex platforms is imperative for the specific diagnosis of such pathogens, and these platforms can be easily used as point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostic tools. With automation and miniaturization, microfluidics-based chips can be easily used as a POC platform. In addition, microfluidics integrated with various other techniques such as PCR, ELISA, and isothermal amplification enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the POC platform within financial and time constrains. These molecular diagnostic tools can be used in surveillance programs intended for biodefense preparedness.",

The antigen-antibody binding activates an intracellular calcium ion channel, and aequorin will emit light [35, 36]. The, CANARY technology was commercialized by PathSensors Company for developing the BioFlash-E Biological Identifier and by Zephyr for screening liquid and powder samples for biological threat agents and toxins. The biosensor is a stand-alone, state-of-the-art device that can be used for both indoor and outdoor applications with an LOD of less than 100 CFU/ml within 5 min and 2\u201315 min, respectively [35]. The various types of advanced biosensors and their applications in the detection of biowarfare agents and infectious pathogens were extensively reviewed elsewhere [37].

Following the detection of SARS-CoV in 2003 and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009, NAAT has become an integrative part for clinical diagnostics and detection of bio threat agents [47, 48]. Real-time PCR, quantitative-PCR (q-PCR), and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) are widely used for the detection and quantification of pathogens [49]. The q-PCR platform quantifies the amount of amplified product in \u201creal-time\u201d by using fluorescent dyes such as SYBR green and light emission upon extension primers, or using probe-based detection systems such as TaqMan\u2122, scorpion probes, and molecular beacons. In RT-PCR, the complementary-DNA (cDNA) copy is synthesized by using reverse transcriptase, which can be amplified later by using gene-specific primers and polymerase enzyme. The human and avian influenza A viruses can be detected in patient samples by using RT-PCR [50, 51].",

The pyrophosphates generated during the addition of nucleotides by DNA polymerases act as substrates for APS enzyme to produce adenosine triphosphate. Adenosine triphosphate is used for the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin by luciferase, and this conversion leads to the emission of light, which is captured by highly sensitive CCD cameras. Therefore, the amount of light produced is proportional to the number of nucleotides added to the growing chain. Apyrase degrades any unincorporated nucleotide.",

The 100\u2013300 bp-long DNA ligated with adaptors is amplified on a solid surface through \u201cflowcells\u201d for bridge PCR amplification. The clonal amplification results in approximately more than 1 million copies of each 100\u2013300 bp-long template. The laser excitation captures the emitted light and records the first base, the reaction is called \u201creversible terminator reaction\u201d. Thereafter, the cycle continues, and multiple sequence reads are recorded, aligned and compared to the reference template. Unlike 454 Pyrosequencing, which produces 1 million reads, the Hi-Seq platforms produces 120\u20131500 GB reads in 3\u201310 days, whereas the MiSeq platforms can produce up to 0.3\u201315 GB reads within 1\u20132 days for clinical testing or laboratory purposes [96].

The technique is mostly similar to Roche or Illumina sequencing but differs by using DNA ligases during sequencing. After the library preparation and colony formation, sequences are detected by a modified probe named \u201cinterrogation probe.\u201d The probe is an octamer consisting of degenerate sequences covalently attached to a fluorescent dye. The first two bases are specific to the DNA template and provide 16 different combinations for annealing (e.g., AT, AG, AA, AC). The interrogation probe provides a free 5\u2032 phosphate group instead of providing a free 3\u2032 hydroxyl group for ligation during each step of reaction by thermostable DNA ligases. The fluorescent signals are recorded by four different channels before the last 3 bp are cleaved for the next cycle. The newly synthesized sequence is removed, and a new complementary primer binds to the n \u2212 1 region of DNA sequence and continues the annealing and ligation cycles. Following this approach, every DNA sequence is sequenced twice, thereby providing accuracy of 99.94% to the system. The read length of this technique ranges from 25 to 35 bp-long sequences [98]. The longer duration time (7\u201314 days) and requirement of skilled personnel are drawbacks of this system [99, 100]. Strain-specific polymorphisms of B. anthracis and Y. pestis were studied by using SOLiD high-throughput-sequencing [101] with high genome coverage and low error rates (>99.99 accuracy).",

ISFET sensors are used to measure the changes in the H+ concentration after every addition of a nucleotide by DNA polymerases during a sequencing step.

It is based on the identification and amplification of the target sequence in the sample with the help of two single stranded oligonucleotide probes (extension probe and template probe). The template probe contains a T7 polymerase promoter sequence and a transcription template. These probes hybridize together with the target RNA or DNA and form a three-way junction or \u201cT-like\u201d structure. The Bst DNA polymerase, which lacks 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease activity is obtained from Bacillus stearothermophilus, which can amplify the nucleic acid at 70 \u00b0C. Once amplified, the target RNA or DNA is used for synthesizing the complementary strand using the extension probe. Thereafter, T7 RNA polymerase synthesizes multiple copies of RNA from the formed DNA duplex (Fig. 13.2). An enzyme-linked oligosorbent assay quantifies the SMART-generated product. Amplicons are captured and detected by biotinylated probes and separated by microfluidics or through molecular beacons [125, 126]. SMART detects genomic DNA (10 ng) and total RNA (0.1 ng) from E. coli in a few hours [127].",

Initially, the recombinase enzyme pairs with the primer and binds to the target sequence, the SSBs then bind the displaced DNA strand and form a \u201cD\u201d loop like structure to stabilize the DNA. This displaced DNA provides a free 3\u2032-hydroxyl site for DNA polymerase to bind and amplify the target sequence. Therefore, both the strands are amplified exponentially within 20 min. The amplified product can be visualized either by fluorescent probes or non-fluorescent probes. RPA can be easily multiplexed by using multiple primer set and can detect more than one disease simultaneously within min (Fig. 13.3). Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV-AY277672 Europe 1 strain) in patient samples was detected within 35 min using isothermal amplification [128]. A commercialized RPA kit (TwistAmp) was launched by TwistDx Inc.; Cambridge, UK, for the rapid detection of pathogens, like Y. pestis, within 1 h with a limit of detection for ssDNA and dsDNA up to 4.04 \u00d7 10(\u221213) and 3.14 \u00d7 10(\u221216) M [129].

In this technique, the low copy number of DNA can be amplified up to 109 copies of target DNA within 1 h at an isothermal temperature. The basic principle is based on highly processive strand displacement DNA polymerases (Bst DNA polymerases) with four primer pairs (recognizing six different regions of target DNA), which amplifies the DNA and ensures the selectivity of target identification. During the initial amplification, the four pairs of primers along with DNA polymerase amplify the DNA, forming a stem loop-like structure. The stem-loop structure becomes the template for cyclic amplification with two additional primer pairs and progresses to elongation and recycling. These additional primer pairs ensure the specificity of subsequent amplification, thereby providing a threefold amplification at every half cycle. The final amplified product consists of cocktail of stem-loop DNAs with different stem lengths and multiple loop structures (Fig. 13.6).",

To further move in the \u201csample-to-result\u201d analysis, 3M and Focus diagnostics developed a direct amplification disk that can amplify and detect pathogen in ~1 h.",

A number of FDA- approved and commercialized kits and devices have been launched for the rapid and quick detection of biothreat agents to strengthen the biodefense preparedness program. Although techniques like microarrays and NGS have potential to revolutionize the detection of biothreat agents, they are time-consuming and generate huge amounts of data that require skilled personnel for interpretation. Therefore, devices or platforms should be designed that are simple and user friendly and low in cost and maintenance for use in various biothreat detection surveillance programs in the field.",
