However, in 1996, the sole manufacturer of these vaccines ceased production. As vaccine stores were depleted, U.S. military trainees again experienced large outbreaks of adenovirus disease, with some deaths reminding public health officials of the impact of adenoviruses.20, 21, 22 In one comprehensive 2006 study, Russell and colleagues documented 98% Ad4 attack rates among 180 susceptible military recruits during 4 weeks of training.23 The importance of these pathogens has been further emphasized through the recent emergence of multiple novel Ad3, Ad7, and Ad14 strains and the subsequent epidemics and deaths they caused.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\n",

Superficial erosions and subepithelial infiltrates of the cornea may occur.39 Preauricular lymph gland swelling and involvement of cervical and submaxillary lymph glands may be observed.39 Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is associated with Ad8, Ad19, Ad37, and, rarely, other types.70, 71, 72, 73, 74 In addition, Ad19 and Ad37 have been isolated from the genital tract of young adults with EKC, and the possibility of sexual transmission has been considered.75, 76 Numerous epidemics of EKC have been associated with ophthalmology practices, where spread from contaminated ophthalmic solutions, fingers, and instruments has been implicated.70, 72, 74, 77, 78\n",

The first acute specimen should be collected as early as possible after onset of illness and the convalescent specimen should be collected 2 to 4 weeks later. Serologic tests for adenoviruses have included complement fixation (CF), HI, SN, indirect immunofluorescence, and enzyme immunoassay (EIA).169 The classical CF test measures adenovirus-group specific antibodies, and though once widely used, lacks sensitivity. The EIA also measures adenovirus group-specific antibodies, but is more sensitive than the CF test and is readily automated and therefore more widely used today.40, 101, 219 HI and SN assays also are more sensitive than CF, but because they measure type-specific antibodies, they are not suitable for routine diagnosis and most reagents are not commercially available.40 Although valuable for outbreak investigations and essential for seroprevalence and vaccine efficacy studies, serology is rarely used today for clinical diagnosis because of the inconvenience of serum collection and the 2- to 4-week delay needed to obtain convalescent serum.",

In a retrospective study of 45 bone marrow transplant recipients treated with cidofovir for adenovirus infections, 31 (69%) had successful outcomes; however, in 18 (40%) of the 45 patients, cidofovir-associated toxicity developed.233\n",

Of 92 episodes of respiratory illness, 24 required hospitalization. The documented hospitalization rate for ARD due to adenovirus Ad4 was 5/100 soldiers per week.15 At large basic training posts, this rate translated to approximately 500 to 800 ARD admissions per week, which had a devastating impact on military hospitals.15, 19 Excess medical costs and the fact that soldiers had to be \u201crecycled\u201d owing to lost training time resulted in significant economic loss to the military. Serious disruptions to training schedules led to administrative attempts to control epidemics, such as sleeping head-to-foot and keeping military units separated (cohorting).19 The impact of adenovirus infections in the military led to the development of adenovirus vaccines.",

Some thought that improved military barracks with modern heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems may have significantly reduced the risk of transmission of the adenoviruses and subsequent disease in susceptible people. The assessment of current risk was hampered by the lack of modern seroprevalence data for Ad4 and Ad7 among new military entrants and the lack of studies of adenovirus carriage, transmission, infection, and disease because the vaccines had been so successful. The U.S. Department of Defense also found it had lost the capability to perform serologic studies for adenovirus infections. Unfortunately, with the loss of the vaccines, adenovirus-associated ARD increased in all uniformed services, including the U.S. Air Force.",
