Its ability to infect hepatocytes and to induce hepatitis correlates with the expression of its cellular membrane receptor, CEACAM-1, previously known as Bgp1a or MHVR, on these cells [7]. We have reported the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) in sera from various mouse strains after MHV-infection [9]. The autoAb were directed to a 40 kDa protein present in mouse liver and kidney identified as fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), a soluble cytosolic enzyme that mediates the hydrolytic formation of fumarate and acetoacetate [9]. We later examined whether the autoimmune response to FAH induced by MHV was based on molecular mimicry and whether the epitope spreading [10], [11], [12] was involved.",

Results indicated that various regions of the enzyme are recognized as soon as 15 days after infection and that the autoimmune response is not restricted to peptides homologous to viral proteins [13]. As the spectrum of peptides recognized by the autoAb of a given mouse did not change significantly with time, it was likely that the MHV-elicited autoimmune response did not induce an epitope recognition spreading. It was suspected that the induction of the autoAb was not solely related to molecular or structural mimicry, but was mainly due to the tissue damages caused by the MHV infection. In other words, the danger signals [14], also called DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) or alarmins, probably played a key role in the autoimmune process.",

The sera were then assayed for autoAb and total IgG 20 days later.

In fact, inoculation of susceptible mice with enterotropic virus such as MHV-A59 causes liver lesions as early as 40 h after infection. The injury during the acute phase of hepatitis includes liver focal necrosis, cells undergoing hyaline degeneration and polymorphonuclear leukocytes invasion [22]. Liver regeneration may take place 10\u201314 days after infection, ranging from complete curing to chronic damage with intermediate stages [22]. On the other hand, CCl4 metabolization by cytochrome P450 in the hepatocytes produces the highly reactive trichloromethyl radical, which leads to lipid peroxidation and membrane damage, as well as inflammatory response and secretion of cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils [23]. Intriguingly, even if both liver injuries produce violent cell death and thus the potential release of endogenous adjuvants (damage-associated molecular patters, or DAMPs) [20], CCl4 did not elicited an autoimmune process, and only autoAb restricted to FAH were detected after MHV infection.",

Moreover, it was demonstrated that regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells (Tregs) are defective numerically and functionally in AIH [30] and that protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation induced by the ectopic expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the liver was mediated by MBP-specific Tregs [31].",

Here we show that a simple and common phenomenon, i.e., a viral infection followed by a toxic liver injury, may induce certain signs of AIH disease. Additionally, current data indicate that some endogenous danger signals, or DAMPs, may be involved in the production of autoAb to FAH induced by MHV infection [Duhalde Vega et al., manuscript in preparation]. Besides, it has been reported that uric acid could augment humoral immune responses [32] and that various Toll-like receptors associated with the modulation of Tregs may bind alarmins \u2013 such as heat shock proteins, high-mobility group Box 1 proteins and chromatin-Ig complexes \u2013 liberated by injured cells [33], [34]. Thus, it is suggested that endogenous adjuvants liberated by the virus and the hepatotoxic agent could join some Toll-like receptors and inhibit Tregs so inducing some of the AIH signs described in this work.",
