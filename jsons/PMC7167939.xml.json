Fig. 4a depicts the detection rate of each respiratory virus in scheduled nasal swab samples. The most commonly detected virus was HRV, found in 29/205 (14.1%) of swabs from cases (19/32 subjects, 59.3%) and 27/215 (12.6%) from controls (16/32 subjects, 50%). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis result showed no significant difference in virus detection rate between the case and the control (p = 0.840). Of interest, we observed that among infants with prolonged/recurrent rhinitis, HRV\u2010positive infants had a higher rate of wheeze (6/19, 31.6%) compared with HRV\u2010negative infants (2/12, 17%). However, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.166), likely due to the relatively small sample size in the current analysis.",

The only other published study which utilized a duration cut\u2010off is the BAMSE cohort study 13, which reported a lower prevalence rate of 3.5% in the first year and 3.8% in the second year of age.

Our observations support the proposal by the European population\u2010based cohort study MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy study) that eczema, wheeze and rhinitis may coexist even in the absence of IgE sensitization, and that IgE sensitization may not be a dominant causal mechanism involved in comorbidity of these disorders 21. Another possible explanation would be that there was localized IgE production which was still undetectable by SPT 22 or that the clinical rhinitis phenotypes precede the development of atopic sensitization 23.

Regardless, both methods have been shown to produce comparable results 27.

This suggests that whilst these subjects did not persistently shed respiratory virus more than controls during symptom free intervals, an extended period of respiratory viruses shedding within a month since the onset of symptom episodes (of at least 2 wk) was observed. These findings may provide clues to the mechanisms of prolonged rhinitis in early life. Whilst it has been shown that respiratory viruses shedding may persist beyond 2 wk of onset of symptoms in 25% of children aged 2\u20139 yr old 28, respiratory virus shedding rarely persists beyond 2 wk following the start of respiratory infections in infants 29. This persistence of virus shedding observed in our prolonged/recurrent rhinitis subjects may be an inherent inability of the subjects in clearing respiratory virus infection, or that prolonged/recurrent rhinitis subjects were more susceptible to new infections following each rhinitis episode. On the other hand, it is also possible that respiratory viruses play a role in the symptomatology of prolonged/recurrent rhinitis in this age group.",
