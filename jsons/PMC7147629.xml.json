Concurrently, crop residues (Ward, 1978; Watson et al., 2015) and corn co-products from ethanol production (Klopfenstein et al., 2008) represent feed resources for beef production that are becoming more abundant, and opportunities to expand their use remain. Investigating alternative management strategies to increase pasture stocking rate and maintain beef production on finite resources is warranted. A practical approach to increase stocking rate may be to replace a portion of the grazed forage by supplementing low-quality crop residues mixed with co-products. Theoretically, replacing approximately 50% of the grazed forage with supplemental feed would support a 2-fold increase in stocking rate. Therefore, the objectives of this multiyear experiment were to evaluate the effects of supplementing modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) mixed with low-quality crop residues to cow-calf pairs grazing smooth bromegrass pastures on (1) cow and calf performance and (2) production economics.",

Cows were maintained on dormant smooth bromegrass pastures and received ad libitum access to alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and smooth bromegrass hay during calving. Mean calving dates were March 13, March 25, and March 25 for calves born in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. Cows were vaccinated approximately 1 mo before calving against bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens type C (Scour Bos 9; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN). Within 24 h of parturition, calving date, calf birth weight, and sex were recorded, and male progeny were band castrated. Approximately 3 wk before initiation of the experiment, all calves were vaccinated against Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium sordellii, C. perfringens types C and D (Ultrabac 7; Zoetis Inc., New York, NY), and cows and calves were transported from the Dalbey-Halleck Research Unit to Agricultural Research and Development Center (approximately 121 km).

Ground cornstalks were chosen as a supplement ingredient to provide rumen fill, and MDGS was added at a minimal level necessary to encourage consumption of the low-quality forage. Based on data with confined cow-calf pairs fed average-quality forage (IVDMD = 53%; Meyer et al., 2012), predicted total forage DMI was calculated as 2.58% of average pair BW throughout the grazing period. Therefore, total estimated DMI was calculated retrospectively based on average pair BW for each treatment. It was anticipated grazed forage intake would be greatest early in the grazing season and decline with seasonal advancement. As a result, pairs were supplemented at 0.6% of BW (DM) at experiment initiation with increasing levels throughout the season on a weekly basis to account for (1) declining grazed forage quality and quantity and (2) increasing consumption by the calf. To encourage pairs to begin consuming the supplement, a 50:50 ratio of MDGS to cornstalks (DM) was initially fed, with cornstalks increasing and MDGS decreasing by 2 percentage unit increments daily until the 30:70 ratio was obtained (10 d). Before the beginning of the experiment, large-round cornstalk bales were ground (Mighty Giant; Jones Manufacturing Co., Beemer, NE) to pass through a 2.54-cm screen. Ground cornstalks and MDGS were stored separately in a partially enclosed commodity bay with concrete flooring before feeding. The supplement was mixed fresh daily using a truck-mounted feed mixer (Roto-Mix, Dodge City, KS), and water was added to reduce the DM content to 30% to enhance palatability and prevent sorting.",

The analysis was completed to model a 200-pair cow-calf enterprise located in eastern Nebraska with the primary assumption that pasture for summer grazing was available for one half (100 pairs) of the cowherd. With limited resources, grazing additional rented pasture sufficient for the remaining 100 pairs or double stocking and providing supplement during the summer grazing season were options considered. For the budget analysis, it was assumed that there would be no decrease or increase in net income between management options because performance and herd inventory would remain unchanged.

Freight expense for shipping cattle to and from pastures was calculated at $2.48/km ($4.00/loaded mile) assuming 3 semitruck loads for 100 pairs. It was assumed that pasture for 100 pairs could be rented 16.1 km (10 miles) away. Feed costs were compiled using data from weekly published feed price reports (USDA-AMS, 2015). Calculated cost for grinding baled cornstalk residue was $12.00/907 kg. Feed needs included a 5% shrink for MDGS and 10% for cornstalks. Yardage expense associated with checking and maintaining fence and caring for cattle was charged at $0.10/pair daily for CON cattle on pasture and $0.20/pair daily for SUPP cattle on pasture to account for increased equipment costs of mixing and delivering the feed. However, equipment necessary for feeding was considered already owned by the enterprise. It was assumed that supplement would be fed in a bunk. Allowing for 0.9 m of linear bunk space for each cow-calf pair requires 50 bunks that are 3.6 m in length. Therefore, bunk costs were included with a total one-time cost of $20,000 (50 bunks at $400/bunk) but were prorated across their assumed lifetime of 10 yr.

Calculated harvest efficiency was numerically greater in the SUPP pastures, ranging from 36.2 to 64.3%. Visual observation suggested that the pairs used the SUPP pastures to a greater degree early in the grazing season and depended more on the supplemental feed later in the season. This greater utilization early in the season maintained the brome in a more vegetative state throughout the grazing season.

Forage production measured on July 10, 2014, was 9,312 kg/ha for the CON pasture and 10,558 kg/ha for the SUPP pasture. We conclude that the grazing pattern and higher harvest efficiency in the SUPP treatment actually had a positive effect on the pastures. A partial explanation for increased forage production in the SUPP pastures might be added N from the supplement. The supplemented feed contained 2% N and supplied 18.5 kg of N/pair during the grazing season. At 19% protein in the gain (NASEM, 2016), the calves removed about 4.3 kg of N and the cows would have removed about 0.10 kg of N/yr. Assuming one half the gain came from the supplemental feed, then about 2.2 kg of N was removed by a pair. The net excretion would be 16.3 kg of N/pair or 23 kg of N/ha. This may explain the greater forage production in 2014 because of carryover of N deposited by the pairs during the previous 3 yr. It also suggests that forage production in the SUPP treatment pastures during this experiment may have been greater than that in the control pastures.",

This may be a feasible management practice to increase stocking rate when pasture for grazing is limited. This technique is likely more applicable in higher-rainfall areas that support the growth of productive cool-season grass species such as smooth bromegrass than on rangelands in more subhumid to semiarid climates, because there are fewer potential risks of overgrazing. Likewise, in such areas ethanol co-products and crop residues are more abundant, and increased competition between uses of land (cropping or pasture grazing) may exist. The price relationship between pasture and feed supplement ingredients dictates the economics of supplementation to increase stocking rate.",
