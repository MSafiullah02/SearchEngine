Plants have been used medicinally for centuries and the medicinal plant trade is still prominent today. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 80% of people living on the African continent, equating to more than a half billion people, use traditional medicines to meet their primary health care needs. Nonetheless, the industry is not yet exploited to its full capacity. In South Africa, for example, around 3 000 medicinal plant species are frequently used in plant-based medicines, however less than 40 indigenous species have been commercialized to some degree (van Wyk, 2008).",

The standard treatment seeks to suppress the HIV replication cycle and halt disease progression. Antiretroviral therapy is significant in improving the life of people living with HIV, however the drugs have many disadvantages, including resistance, toxicity, limited availability, and lack of curative effect (Chinsembu and Hedimbi, 2010a). The potential of HIV becoming resistant to anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment has become an increasing concern since it was first reported decades ago (De Clercq, 1995). As pathogens become drug resistant, the need for development of new medicines is being realized all over the world. These shortcomings open avenues for the use of natural products in the management of HIV/AIDS.",

Initially publication titles were screened for suitability and plant species, active compounds and their mode of action were documented from primary literature sources. Ethnobotanical surveys in other African countries such as Ethiopia (Asres et al., 2001), Uganda (Lamorde et al., 2010), Cameroon (Mbaveng et al., 2011), Zimbabwe (Viol et al., 2016), Namibia (Chinsembu and Hedimbi, 2010) and Zambia (Chinsembu, 2016) also assisted in identifying plants traditionally used for management of HIV or HIV symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: (1) plants should have a record of traditional/popular use for infectious or viral diseases, HIV treatment or symptoms similar to HIV infection, (2) if not traditionally/popularly used, plants should be closely related to plants with popular use and HIV activity identified by means of in vitro assays, (3) plants should have been identified scientifically, (4) should be native to the southern African region and (5) anti-HIV activity should be within acceptable ranges. Clinical relevant concentrations have been defined as IC50 of<50 or<100 \u00b5g/ml for extracts and at<5 or<25 \u00b5M for individual compounds and have been applied as a selection criterion in this study (Agarwal et al., 2014; Butterweck and Nahrstedt, 2012; Cos et al., 2006; Gertsch, 2009). Since traditional refers to plants with a long history of use, and HIV being a relatively new disease, the use of these plants are referred to as \u201cpopular\u201d or \u201cpopularly used\u201d against HIV.",

Most of the tests are performed on the enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and protease (PR), proteins involved in activation of viral genes or cells that are infected with viruses or pseudoviruses, and the activity determined by an indicator such as MTT or luciferase activity. The MTT assays are based on the reduction of the yellow coloured 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of metabolically active cells. In metabolically active cells, blue formazan is produced which is measured spectrophotometrically to indicate cell viability in assays of cell proliferation and cytotoxicity (Cos et al., 2002; Shoemaker et al., 2004). These targets aim to determine the inhibition or reduction of viral infection on various levels, and present various advantages and disadvantages to be considered in evaluating anti-viral activity (\nTable 1).",

            "text": "RT converts the viral RNA genome to viral DNA using its polymerase domain (RNA dependent DNA polymerase activity), while the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain degrades the RNA component from the intermediary RNA/DNA complex. The enzyme also has a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase function and most clinically available RT drugs, therefore target this enzyme. Numerous studies focused on the HIV-1 RT enzyme and various protocols have been employed measuring ethyl-3H thymidine triphosphate (3H TTP) by RT using polyadenylic acid-oligodeoxythymidilic acid (polyA-oligodT) as template primer in the presence and absence of a test substance such as isolated compounds or plant extracts (Ali et al., 2002, Bessong et al., 2005). Various kits are used for determining the inhibition of enzymes and viral components such as the Capture ELISA kit (GenxBio Health Science, India) (Chinnaiyan et al., 2013) and HIV-RT colourimetric enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA) kit obtained from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany (Chukwujekwu et al., 2014, Eldeen et al., 2011, Kapewangolo et al., 2013, Klos et al., 2009, Tshikalange et al., 2008a, Wang et al., 2014) or a purified recombinant HIV-1 RT enzyme (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (Kapewangolo et al., 2013). Several interactions and measures have been identified to optimise the assay conditions. It has been found that HIV-1 RT uses magnesium or manganese divalent ions as a co-factor (Bolton et al., 2002) and that palladium and iron might also affect the assay as they are responsible for irreversible inhibition of RT and subsequent reduction in virus proliferation (Filler and Lever, 1997). Since ions of various metals are accumulated by plants and therefore present in plant extracts, these ions may be present in and might affect the outcomes. Most methodologies describing the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by crude plant extracts do not take into consideration the effect of metal ions in regulating the activity of HIV-1 RT (Bessong and Obi, 2006). Consequently, it would be important to determine metal ions in plant extracts prior to screening in order to avoid false inhibitory observations at the screening stage.",

The protease enzyme has also been investigated in various assays such as the fluorometric detection of HIV-PR activity using HIV-II PR HIV-FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) (AnaSpec Inc., USA) and a recombinant HIV-1 protease solution (Bachem, Switzerland). The glycohydrolase enzymes are found in the eukaryotic host cell's Golgi apparatus and are responsible for glycosylation of proteins. Inhibition of the glycohydrolase enzymes decreases the infectivity of the HIV virion, as the HIV envelope proteins are highly glycosylated during the life cycle of the virus. Glucosidase was found to be partly responsible for the glycosylation of HIV gp120 (Harnett et al., 2005, Kapewangolo et al., 2013, Klos et al., 2009). Escherichia coli expressing recombinant HIV-1 PR has also been used to detect the inhibitory effects of samples on HIV-1 PR by observing the bacterial growth curve (Jiang et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2014).",

Cell based assays are commonly used with various different cell types and viruses. The CXCR4-tropic (NL4-3) or CCR5-tropic (NL-AD87) wild-type reference viruses (Louvel et al., 2013) and HIV-1c binding and entry assay on PBMCs have been described (Leteane et al., 2012). The utilised format \u201ciFIGS\u201d (Infection format of \u201cFusion-induced gene stimulation\u201d) represents an in vitro infection system in human HeLa cells. Thereby, upon infection with HIV, the reporter gene will be induced in a quantifiable fashion as beta galactosidase allows quantification of inhibitory effects of compounds or extracts (Lubbe et al., 2012). HIV-1 pseudovirions and viruses has been used (Ngwira et al., 2015, Prinsloo et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2014) and Hela-Tat-Luc cells that are stably transfected with for instance a plasmid pcDNA3-TAT together with a reporter plasmid LTR-Luc indicates protein activation. Therefore the HIV-1 LTR is highly activated in this cell line as a consequence of high levels of intracellular Tat protein (Tshikalange et al., 2008b). Isolated HIV strains (strain HTLV-IIIB/LAI) obtained from the culture supernatant of a HIV-infected HUT-78 cell line have been tested and cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay (Cos et al., 2002). African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) have also been used (Dang et al., 2011) and linked to cytotoxicity assays on MT-4 cells (Maregesi et al., 2010a, Maregesi et al., 2010b).",

            "text": "In vitro assays have an important role in determining anti-HIV activity, mindful of the pitfalls and false positives that might arise from compounds in plant crude extracts. The lack of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) characteristics and the lack of direct correlation with in vivo/clinical doses, limit the scope of application of in vitro bioassays and add to the challenges faced by in vitro screening (Agarwal et al., 2014). It is often inaccurate to relate in vitro results from enzyme or protein inhibition assays to the in vivo situation, and these should be considered in screening of botanicals and botanical preparations. The hydrolysis and phase-II transformation of compounds within the in vivo system contribute to the incompatibility of in vitro results to the in vivo situation. Hydrolysis of flavonoids may result in formation of non-conjugated analogues able to induce a specific biological response to an even larger extent than the non-hydrolysed extract. Hydrolysis will also provide a site for conjugation which will result in excretion of the conjugate in the urine and the bile (Day et al., 1998). The type of flavonoid, the position and nature of the sugar may also affect the metabolism in the intestine and passing to the large intestine for absorption there (Barrington et al., 2009, Hollman, 2004). Once the aglycone is absorbed it is quickly metabolised to form phase-II conjugates, mostly sulphates and glucuronides or O-methylation, which have a major impact on their activity as well as the ability of the body to excrete compounds (Barrington et al., 2009, Hollman, 2004). These phase-II conjugates, obviously are not representative of the compounds in the original plant extract or botanical preparation anymore, and challenge the results obtained from in vitro assays. Well-known flavonoids such as kaempferol, apigenin and galangin are only present in low concentrations in plasma as they are nearly exclusively present as conjugated glucuronides in the systemic circulation after phase-II biotransformation (Barrington et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2003, Hollman, 2004). Quercetin is often reported in anti-viral assays and is known for its specific absorption and hydrolysis patterns. Quercetin glucoside is absorbed in the small intestine, whereas quercetin rutinoside is absorbed from the colon after deglycosylation (Hollman, 2004). Caffeic acid and ferulic acid, also well-known anti-viral compounds are examples of compounds subjected to transformation, both metabolised to glucuronides although not very effectively (Spencer et al., 1999). No glucuronides have, however, been observed for chlorogenic acid and anthocyanidin glycosides which are rapidly absorbed and able to withstand deglycosylation reactions in humans (Hollman, 2004).",

The structural diversity and adaptation ability to various environmental conditions have resulted in development of a range of defense compounds with various biological activities, therefore plant secondary metabolites represent a huge source for novel anti-HIV drugs that may be functional against HIV. Guided fractionation of these crude extracts has provided a platform for the discovery of novel and known anti-HIV compounds. With the emergence of drug resistant HIV variants in patients receiving ARV treatment, the search for novel effective inhibitors of HIV has accelerated. A condensed summary of some of the most active and most studied classes of plants compounds are provided in\nTable 2.",

Narciclasine inhibits protein synthesis at the step of peptide bond formation whereas pretazettine strongly inhibits the activity of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RT), from various oncogenic viruses by binding to the enzyme (Fennell and van Staden, 2001). Other important compounds known to treat other ailments from this family include crinine and galanthamine with central nervous system activity due to their resemblance to morphine and codeine skeletons (Fennell and van Staden, 2001).

Some of the dicaffeoylquinic acids (DCQAs) and the dicaffeoyltartaric acids (DCTAs) are selective inhibitors of HIV-1 IN at concentrations between 150 and 840 nM. The compounds that have been reported to date include 3,5-DCQA, 1-methoxyoxalyl-3,5-DCQA (1-MO-3,5-DCQA), 1,5-DCQA, 3,4-DCQA and 4,5-DCQA, as well as a related dicaffeoyltartaric acid (L-chicoric acid) (McDougall et al., 1998). Some of the caffeoyl- and galloylquinic acids is nonspecific in its anti-HIV activity and binds to the gp120 protein to inhibit virus replication, preventing binding to the CD4 receptor. They are also not specific to the HI virus as similar anti-viral activity was also observed with HSV type 1. The galloyl derivatives were previously shown to inhibit the in vitro activities of both HIV-RT and cellular DNA polymerases, in particular DNA polymerase a (Mahmood et al., 1993). McDougall et al. (1998), however, strongly argue that the activity of these compounds is not linked to HIV-RT, but that they are several times more active on the HIV IN enzyme. Some caffeoylquinic acids showed activity against HIV-1 IN, but caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid were not active, and show the selective nature of this wide variety of related compounds. Chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, which was not active on HIV-1 IN reduced the amount of HBV-DNA more effectively than that of the viral antigens (Wang et al., 2009) also showing the potential use of the CQA's to treat other viral infection. The CQA's have been reported in numerous studies to have potent activity against HSV as well (Khan et al., 2005, Lall et al., 2005, Meyer et al., 1997, Thompson, 2006). Furthermore, it was shown that very active and abundant anti-HIV compounds such as 5-O-chlorogenic acid (5-CGA) is highly bioavailable as it is absorbed in the stomach and jejunum followed by absorption along the small intestine and also the large intestine (Farah et al., 2008). Other compounds such as 3-CQA, 5-CQA, 3,4-DCQA, 3,5-DCQA, and 4,5-DCQA are all present in the plasma with low concentrations of caffeic, ferulic, isoferulic, and p-coumaric acids (Farah et al., 2008) and might not be realistically recorded in in vitro assays which are often reported at much higher concentrations.",

A more possible explanation is however their pro-oxidant activity as they can be oxidized to form quinones when oxidized by peroxidase/H2O2 or tyrosinase/O2. These quinones can be very toxic in cells due to creating oxidative stress, but are kept in their unoxidised state by antioxidants such as glutathione or ascorbic acid (Moridani et al., 2011). Flavonoids act as pro-oxidants in producing a quinone which produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are very effective in the defense of herbivores and pathogenic attack. Addition of 0.2% caffeic acid or 0.2% 5-CQA to mice, resulted in a significantly increased level of Glutathione S-transferase (GST), probably due to their pro-oxidant activity and electrophile-responsive element (EpRE) activation. Similarly many cinnamic acids have been shown to be potent inducers of NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase (Clifford, 1999). The DCQA's and DCTA's are bis-catechols and do not appear to inhibit HIV-1 RT within the cell, but acting directly through inhibition of IN (McDougall et al., 1998).",

Many studies have relied on the traditional uses of medicinal plants in treating viral infections and various accounts of very active plants have been documented (Bessong et al., 2005). Where anti-HIV activity could be linked to isolated compounds from southern African plants, it is often compounds previously identified for anti-HIV activity in plants from other regions of the world. It is therefore evident that similar compounds or compound groups have been identified as the active principles in plant preparations from various regions in the world and the repeated identification should be supported by progression into in vivo studies, especially in the southern African region where affordable and safe medicines are needed urgently.",

Enough evidence has been accumulated in various studies to warrant further investigation into the active principles and chemical profile of anti-viral plants with specific focus on the three mentioned groups. A systematic review by Liu and Yang (2005) assessed the beneficial effects and risks of herbal medicines in patients with HIV infection and AIDS, and concluded that there is inadequate evidence to support the use of herbal medicines in HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients. However, potential beneficial effects need to be confirmed in large, rigorous trials (Liu et al., 2005). Few southern African plants or plant compounds are currently in clinical trial studies. For example, S. frutescens, indigenous to Lesotho, South Africa, southern Namibia and southeastern Botswana has a wealth of preclinical data (van Wyk and Albrecht, 2008). A phase I study has shown that S. frutescens is well tolerated and that it showed no significant side effects (Johnson et al., 2007). Recently the results of an adaptive two-stage randomized double-blind placebo controlled study were published. The study evaluated the safety of consuming dried S. frutescens by HIV seropositive adults with CD4 T-lymphocyte count of>350 cells/\u03bcL. Sutherlandia frutescens did not change HIV viral load, and CD4 T-lymphocyte count and was similar in the two arms at 24 weeks; however, mean and total burden of infection was greater in the S. frutescens arm attributed to two tuberculosis cases in subjects taking isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). The study concluded that possible interaction between S. frutescens and IPT needs further evaluation, although no other safety issues relating to consumption of S. frutescens were identified (Wilson et al., 2015). The equally good activity of some of the compounds such as the chlorogenic acids on other viruses such as HSV also support intensified in vivo studies to support developing these plant extracts or compounds into anti-viral treatments. Apart from S. frutescens entering clinical studies, no other plants from this region have advanced to this stage, even though the majority of HIV infected individuals are treated with medicinal plant preparations from this region. The low number of plant extracts and compounds in advanced studies support the need for more focus on developing the research potential identified in the published studies to reach the commercial market. By evaluating and advancing more herbal preparations and compounds for testing in vivo will ensure that more treatments reach the commercial markets.",

This could be attributed to the lack of long term funding and infrastructure and is supported by many plants tested in facilities not within the southern African region. From screening literature, it would therefore seem as if common compounds or compound groups from southern African plants, of which many are well-known and previously confirmed for their anti-viral activity from plants from other areas of the world, are repeatedly identified as anti-HIV agents. It is therefore argued that the presence of well-known and well-researched plant compounds with anti-HIV activity from southern Africa should direct future focus in development of anti-viral agents for rapid development of affordable anti-HIV treatments. This should also be followed-up in in vivo studies as this information is lacking and anti-HIV activity is only dependent on the in vitro assay results currently available. In this review current information on southern African plants with traditional use against viral infections and specifically HIV treatment or HIV related diseases or symptoms is presented with the aim to develop treatments for people living with HIV/AIDS, as there is an urgent need to fast track in vivo testing and HIV/AIDS clinical trials of candidate drugs developed from compounds isolated from plants for effective and affordable alternatives to current treatment options.",
