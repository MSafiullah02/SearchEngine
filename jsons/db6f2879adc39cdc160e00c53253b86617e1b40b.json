The second day, if all those exams and physical examination had ruled out COVID-19 infection and related syndromes, the patient was admitted to the GK center. After arrival, the patient washed his/her hands with hand sanitizer and stored in a locker all personal belongings. Peripheral pulse oximetry was placed to assess oxygenation status, and the stereotactic head frame was fixed. The patient was transferred to radiology procedural suit and back by traveling on a wheelchair. Stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging was acquired, and radiosurgery was performed with the Leksell GK Perfexion (Elekta AB instruments, Stockholm, Sweden). At the end of the procedure, the frame was removed, and the patient was discharged home. Finally, the GK and radiology rooms were sanitized and disinfected carefully.",

It can be performed in outpatient setting as a single-session procedure, opposite to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, which requires between 10 and 30 hospital visits. Second, GK radiosurgery does not require endotracheal intubation or the use of high-speed instruments, lowering the risk of exposure to infectious aerosols and bone dust present in open surgical procedures. [2] Treating patients at their oncological reference center instead of being referred to distant centers is also relevant. As an example, we are able to make direct online comparison between a patient's latest brain imaging and stored exams/plans using the Leksell GammaPlan software (Elekta AB instruments, Stockholm, Sweden). This allows to distinguish new metastatic lesions from remnants of previous treatments or presumed radiation necrosis, as well as to make more accurate dosimetric prescriptions together with our radiotherapists and medical physicists. Finally, patients can be directly assessed by their personal oncologist while at their reference center.",
