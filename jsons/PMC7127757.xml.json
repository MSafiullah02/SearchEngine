The system includes a total of 12 hospitals in a compact geographic region surrounding and including St. Louis, Missouri, and we included readmission to any of these hospitals in our analysis. People treated within this health-care system are, in nearly all cases, readmitted to one of the system's participating hospitals.

We relied on logistic regression for identifying variables independently associated with 90-day readmission. Based on univariate analysis, variables significant at P < .10 were entered into the model. To arrive at the most parsimonious model, we used a stepwise backward elimination approach. We evaluated colinearity with correlation matrices. We report adjusted ORs and 95% CIs where appropriate. We conducted a cross-validation of the model to assess for overfitting. We reran the logistic model on 90% of the sample, sequentially dropping 10% of the population with each run. We contrasted the mean accuracy of these analyses with the overall accuracy of the model developed with the entire cohort. All analyses were performed with SPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM).",

Previous pneumonia studies have shown that inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy due to infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with increased risk of mortality.18 Micek et al19 recently demonstrated that inappropriate initial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in the ED setting was associated with a significantly greater risk of hospital readmission. Multivariate analysis using hospital readmission as the dependent outcome identified antibiotic exposure in the previous 30 days, presence of peripheral vascular disease, and increasing CURB-65 (confusion, blood urea nitrogen > 7 mmol/L, respiratory rate > 30/min, BP < 90 mm Hg, systolic or diastolic BP \u2264 60 mm Hg, \u2265 age 65 years) scores as predictors for readmission. Like the Department of Veterans Affairs study,16 pneumonia-related variables did not predict readmission. However, Micek et al19 also found that antibiotic exposure in the previous 30 days was independently associated with inappropriate antibiotic therapy, thus providing a link between inappropriate therapy and hospital readmission. However, it is likely that for most patients, infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a marker for greater underlying disease severity and comorbidities, further supporting a plausible link between pathogen type and readmission risk.13, 20, 21\n",

Moreover, such data could more objectively identify hospitals caring for patients at higher risk for readmission because of case mix, potentially mitigating financial penalties for readmission in those patients. The latter is supported by a study by Shorr et al,22 who found that patients with health-care-associated pneumonia were more than seven times as likely to be readmitted to the hospital compared with patients with community-acquired pneumonia. These investigators showed that admission from long-term care, underlying immunosuppression, prior antibiotic exposure, and prior hospitalization within the preceding 90 days were predictors for readmission. None of these risk factors would be amenable to direct intervention by the treating clinicians to reduce the likelihood of readmission. These investigators were also unable to establish a relationship between appropriateness of antibiotic therapy and being rehospitalized, thus illustrating that care delivery may have only a limited causal role in driving rehospitalization. The absence of a nexus between initial antibiotic therapy for the index pneumonia and readmission underscores that nonmodifiable patient or pathogen characteristics are likely key determinants of whether a subject with pneumonia is eventually readmitted. Our data would support this hypothesis by identifying pneumonia pathogen characterization as an important risk factor for readmission.",

It is possible that we did not identify all patient variables and processes of care that are important determinants of 90-day readmission in this population. Moreover, the retrospective nature of this investigation did not allow an assessment of specific treatment considerations such as the response to antibiotic therapy and pneumonia recurrence, and limited our ability to identify readmissions to nonsystem hospitals. Second, we focused on pathogen type as a determinant of readmission and not the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. This was purposefully done, given the established strong association between antibiotic-resistant bacteria and host-specific risk factors (eg, prior antibiotics, recent hospitalization), as well as with the administration of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy.11, 12, 13, 18, 19 Pathogen type seems to be a simple marker encompassing these risks, to include the administration of inappropriate therapy, and is in line with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services goal to discover more easily identifiable objective measures to assess patient risks and quality of care.23 Third, we simply categorized pathogens into broad categories without determining whether certain pathogens, or pathogen subtypes, were more likely to be associated with 90-day readmission.",

Several studies have identified early posthospital follow-up visits as important means of preventing readmissions.9, 10 Additionally, even though all patients had respiratory cultures obtained, it is possible that some of these cultures may represent inadequate specimens. Moreover, a proportion of the culture-negative samples may have been due to inadequate specimen collection. This could have underestimated the number of patients with antibiotic-resistant pathogens in our study, potentially influencing our results. Finally, the patient population at Barnes-Jewish Hospital may not be representative of that at other centers. This is supported by the high percentage of S aureus infection we observed, likely due to the high prevalence of health-care-associated risk factors in the population.21 However, a strength of our study is that we did not limit inclusion to patients with a specific type of pneumonia but included all types, except for those due to opportunistic pathogens.",
