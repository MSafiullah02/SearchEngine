The general biological lesson is that the overwhelming source of human genetic variation is between individuals and not between ethnic groups. In the paper this becomes even clearer by the finding that there are no absolute genetic differences between ethnic groups: the differences that exist are in relative frequencies only. The methodological lesson is that for genetic risk assessment it follows that investigators can use standard epidemiological study designs, provided self-reported ethnic background is taken into account: for such risk assessment one should not worry about genetic admixture'. The most enlightening aspect of the paper, however, is the insight that it gives in the Genetic structure of human populations'\u2013the very title of the paper.\u201d\n",

You, the reader, could reasonably be wondering\u2014where is the British Medical Journal? Where is Nature? Was there nothing of interest in either publication all year? Perhaps these absences are the most troubling results of all. We have sent the editors of both journals a very nice Christmas card as consolation. Better luck next year.",

            "text": "\n\u201cWe feel strongly that advances in medical knowledge only rarely can be conceptualised as single best papers. There are enough papers with outstanding, even unassailable, scientific methods that it would be artificial to choose among them. As for topics, there are many different kinds of excellence. Some papers are about health problems with a high burden of suffering and others about rare conditions; some are about promising new observations and others penetrating syntheses of existing knowledge; some help guide public health practices, others clinical practice, and still others are basic observations about the biology of disease. The weight of evidence, on which clinical and public health decisions depend, consists almost always of many different kinds of contributions and rarely an individual paper. Singling out one for recognition is, in our opinion, artificial. We suppose that there are exceptions from time to time, such as the Watson/Crick paper on the structure of DNA. Probably those exceptions are less common these days, with good reasons, because the research enterprise is larger and more robust than it was when the DNA discovery was made. We understand that others see value in best in the world' recognition, especially for individual investigators (not papers). Witness the wide attention given to the Nobel Prize. But we think Nobel Prizes illustrate the problem. They are for only one kind of contribution, basic science research. For example, Sir Austin Bradford-Hill, through his work in biostatistics and especially the first modern RCT [randomised controlled trial], has had profound effects on clinical research in this century, yet never received a Nobel Prize. So it is just too out of character for us to pretend that we see the world in the way this project does and to send a selection would be disingenuous. We know you do not want that from us. Perhaps outstanding papers should be recognised in the many different categories we mention, something like the Academy Awards in film-making.\u201d\n",
