            "text": "The term acute lung injury (ALI) refers to a syndrome of diffuse pulmonary inflammation and increased capillary permeability that manifests in acute refractory hypoxemia and lung infiltrates. Although references date through the last century, the first formal description of the syndrome is attributed to Ashbaugh in 1967.1 Historically, reports of the syndrome have included terms such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and shock lung, thus emphasizing specific patient populations or predisposing conditions. More recently, hyaline membrane disease of newborns has been recognized as sharing the same radiographic and histologic findings, and being mediated by the same cellular and soluble factors, as the syndrome seen in adults with septic shock. To incorporate all continuums of patient populations and the vast variety of primary insults that lead to the final common pathway of diffuse pulmonary parenchymal damage, the more inclusive terms acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are now favored. The first American European Consensus Conference2 defined ALI as (1) acute onset of bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema; (2) the absence of evidence for left atrial hypertension; and (3) reduced ratio of arterial oxygen tension (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2), Pao2/Fio2. The syndrome is called ALI when Pao2/Fio2 >300 and ARDS when this ratio falls below 200. The consensus definitions of ALI/ARDS have allowed for extensive clinical and translational research into the mechanisms of lung injury and repair.",

Neutrophils are recruited to injured sites by the expression of adhesion molecules including intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and E-selectin on activated endothelial cells, and plasma levels of these adhesion molecules correlate with the degree of organ dysfunction.30 Once recruited to the alveolus, neutrophils in patients with ALI demonstrate activation of the transcriptional regulatory unit nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), which in turn increases neutrophil expression of IL-1\u03b2 and other proinflammatory mediators implicated in tissue injury. Accordingly, both the persistence of alveolar neutrophils and the activation of NF-\u03baB within neutrophils31 correlate inversely with survival. Following activation, neutrophils orchestrate a process of oxidative burst which generates hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that destroy invading pathogens. This free-radical stress also culminates in oxidized host phospholipid membranes that alter mitochondrial and cellular function and compound tissue injury. Neutrophils may play a key role in the apoptosis (or programmed cell death) of immune cells in the lung through regulation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) pathways.32\n",

This controversy is at least in part due to the recognition that these processes contribute to organ injury but are also key mediators of host defense.

Alveolar macrophages are the resident immune cell in the lung, and represent the innate host defense system and as such initiate many of the processes leading to the intense inflammatory response of ALI (Fig. 6-1\n). Importantly, key macrophage activity may precede the clinical recognition of the disease. Alveolar macrophages recognize pathogens or their products through various cell surface receptors. In the most well-characterized system, pathogens or their products initially bind to CD14 which in turn recruits Toll-like receptor (TLR) subtypes that are specific for the toxin.33, 34, 35 Together, toxin binding to CD14/TLR leads to activation of the macrophage and a subsequent intense inflammatory response. In addition to CD14 on the cell surface, macrophages release a soluble form of the receptor, sCD14, which activates cells that do not express CD14 (most notably endothelial and epithelial cells). The importance of sCD14 is demonstrated by the finding that the concentration of this protein in alveolar fluid is highly associated with the number of neutrophils in the lung.36\n",

Whether the noted changes represent an injury to the endothelial cell or an activation of this cell line is controversial. Most likely, there is a continuum of altered endothelial processes that, if allowed to persist unabated, lead to irreversible loss of normal function. Because endothelial cell changes in ALI involve a loss of normal cell function and the extent of endothelial changes is related to the severity of disease, the term endothelial injury will be used throughout this chapter. This view is exemplified by findings that von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf, normally found in large concentrations only within endothelial cells) is released from injured cells into the vessel lumen and into the alveolar space. The extracellular concentrations of vWf are predictive of the development of ALI in those at risk,45 and of outcome in patients with established ALI.46, 47\n",

VEGF stimulates the expres sion of several adhesion molecules on the luminal surface of endothelial cells, particularly intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM), and the selectin family of glycoproteins. Together, these adhesion molecules function to slow neutrophil transport within the vessel and initiate rolling and adhesion of neutrophils on the endothelial surface (Fig. 6-2\n). Additional chemotactic molecules on the basolateral surface and beyond then promote transmigration through the permeable endothelium. VEGF is downregulated by endothelial-derived factors and this function is lost during sepsis; hence, the loss of normal endothelial function contributes to further endothelial injury. Importantly, manipulations to decrease expression of VEGF lead to decreased organ injury and improved mortality in live-infection models of sepsis, demonstrating the importance of VEGF and the related adhesion molecules in the progression of disease.49 Consistent with these findings, the concentrations of endothelial-neutrophil adhesion molecules are more strongly associated with mortality in humans than are measures of neutrophil activation.30\n",

The epithelial surface is lined mainly with type I pneumocytes that maintain the structural integrity of the alveolus through barrier function. The remaining cells in the lung epithelium are type II pneumocytes, whose diverse functions include ion transport regulation, surfactant production, and regeneration of type I pneumocytes. Defects in epithelial function lead to alveolar fluid accumulation in two ways\u2014increased permeability and decreased fluid transport out of the alveoli. However, the epithelial barrier is less permeable than the endothelium, even after injurious exposure,53 suggesting that defects in alveolar liquid clearance play a large role in the accumulation of extravascular lung water. Indeed, the rate of alveolar fluid clearance is impaired in patients with ALI, and inversely related to prognosis.54 Transepithelial transport of fluid occurs in several fashions, the best described being along an osmotic gradient formed by active transport of sodium via a Na+/K+-ATPase on the basolateral surface of type II pneumocytes.55 Experimental evidence shows that hypoxia leads to displacement of the Na+/K+-ATPase from the basolateral surface\u2014a condition that is rapidly reversible with alveolar instillation of the beta-adrenergic agonist, terbutaline.56 Although the role of Na+/K+-ATPase in human ALI is still unclear, beta-agonist administration decreases total lung water in ALI patients, lending support to this hypothesis. Alveolar fluid clearance is impaired by several factors in addition to hypoxia. The generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, possibly caused by free-radical deactivation of transport proteins, diminishes epithelial fluid transport.57, 58 Epithelial function is likely impaired through a loss of epithelial cells through the process of apoptosis.58\n",

In contrast, there is a significant body of evidence that surfactant, a secretory product of the epithelium, is altered in composition and function in human ALI. Normal lung surfactant is composed of phospholipids, neutral lipids, apoproteins, and the surfactant proteins (SP)-A, B, C, and D. During ALI, the total amount of surfactant phospholipids is reduced, with marked decreases in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol61, 62; these changes are associated with increased surface tension of surfactant liquid61 and the severity of respiratory failure.63 In addition to deficiencies in phospholipids, there is marked depletion of SP-A and SP-B during ALI. The net deficiency of proteins and phospholipids is due to decreased production by type II pneumocytes as a result of inflammation64 and increased destruction by oxidant stress65 and proteolytic cleavage.66 The findings of abnormal surfactant composition and function have led to more than 200 clinical evaluations of exogenous surfactant,67 yet no trial has provided a convincing mortality benefit.

Despite the intense effort spent in researching the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of ALI, criticism of human studies has evolved and some consideration of sampling techniques must be mentioned. In most instances, cytokines participate in cell signaling through interaction with cell surface receptors and in this regard may have very localized effects. In parallel, because various anatomic barriers compartmentalize the immune response,68 cytokine concentrations may be quite different in the serum, alveolar space, or lung parenchyma. Furthermore, systemic cytokines may represent \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d69 or overflow of cytokines from various sources,70 making interpretation of these factors complex. There is evidence, however, that the alveolar compartment is disrupted during intense inflammation and airway sampling yields cytokine concentrations that are similar to more invasive sampling.71 With this in mind, as well as the capacity to perform repeated measurements in patients safely and easily, most regard bronchoscopic sampling of alveolar fluids as the best method available to assess the role of cytokines in ALI.72\n",

INF-\u03b1 has been identified in BAL fluid in some, but not all, studies of human ALI. This discrepancy may be related in part to timing of samples because this cytokine may be prevalent in the airway fluid for less than 24 hours. INF-\u03b1 exerts its effects through interaction with TNF receptors I and II on the surface of macrophages and other immune cells,73 or is shed as a soluble receptor. INF-\u03b1 interactions with these soluble receptors are complex because the receptors may either potentiate INF-\u03b1 effects by stabilizing the cytokine, or attenuate INF-\u03b1 effects by interfering with INF-\u03b1 binding to active receptors.74 The local effects of INF-\u03b1 collectively function to increase inflammation within the tissue by activating endothelial cells, thereby increasing vascular permeability and allowing the passage of immune cells, immunoglobulin, and complement into the tissue.

In keeping with its role as an integrative cytokine, IL-6 reduces the effects of INF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 by inhibiting their production80 and stimulating their natural antagonists.81 However, the most widely described anti-inflammatory cytokine is IL-10. This counter-regulatory protein is synthesized in lymphocytes and monocytic cells in response to bacteria and inflammatory cytokines, and inhibits inflammatory cytokines, inhibits class II major histocompatibility protein expression, and suppresses monocyte procoagulant activity in experimental systems. IL-10 is found in BAL fluid during ALI, and lower levels of this cytokine are associated with a poor prognosis.82 Although this suggests that failure to decrease inflammation leads to increased injury, increasing IL-10 in pneumonia models leads to impaired bacterial clearance and increased mortality.83\n",

Although these studies provide irrefutable evidence of the involvement of many biochemical and cytologic processes, none has clearly prevailed as primary mediators amenable to therapy in human disease. Attempts at blocking or reversing suspected agents in patients have been generally unsuccessful and, at times, lethal. At least four issues may explain this apparent inconsistency. First, ALI induces a complex and redundant inflammatory milieu, and ameliorating any one factor is unlikely to stop the cascade of events. Second, inflammation and organ injury likely begin hours or days prior to the clinical recognition of the disease such that the primary mediators are no longer actively involved at the time of therapy. Third, the inflammatory process is, in fact, a reaction to a primary inciting event; a reduction in inflammation impairs host defense mechanisms. Fourth, and related to the latter issue, the host response is a tightly controlled response involving an initial proinflammatory response rapidly followed by an exuberant anti-inflammatory response. Both responses are increased during the first days of lung injury; however inflammatory antagonists predominate in the alveoli within 24 hours of disease onset.84 It is becoming clear that the balance of inflammatory agonists and antagonists in patients at risk for lung injury may be more important than any one factor.85, 86 Further, exogenous attempts at altering inflammation may disrupt this balance and lead to either excessive inflammation or impaired host defenses, both of which may increase mortality.87\n",

Briefly, renin is produced by a variety of stimuli, including decreased glomerular pressure as encountered during shock. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin, which is subsequently transformed to angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE subtype I (ACE-1).

These findings were initially explained as a demonstration of shedding of ACE-1 from injured endothelium, but there has been gradual acceptance that RAS is actively involved in the process of acute lung injury. Certainly RAS is upregulated in critical illness and patients have increased concentrations of Ang II in serum. It is also clear that this peptide mediates many of the pathogenic processes implicated in lung injury. Ang II promotes inflammation through activation of the NF-\u03baB pathways,90 as well as through the recruitment of immune cells via increased expression of VEGF91 and of intercellular adhesion markers.92 Furthermore, through the AT-1 receptor, Ang II promotes collagen formation in lung fibroblasts93 and apoptosis in epithelial cells94 and hence is responsible for features seen during the fibroproliferative phase of ALI. Most strikingly, AT-1 receptor blockers may decrease neutrophil infiltration, improve oxygenation, and prolong survival in an animal model of ALI.95\n",

An early study showed that patients managed with attempts to decrease extravascular lung water had more ventilator-free days than those whose fluid management was based on pulmonary capillary wedge pressures123\u2014whether this was an effect of net fluid management or of the monitoring techniques was unclear. Increasing plasma oncotic pressure while decreasing total body water by co-infusing furosemide and albumin may also improve ICU-related outcomes.124 The large ARDSnet Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial utilized a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design including conservative or liberal fluid treatment strategies guided by either central or pulmonary artery catheters.104, 106 Patients who were randomized to conservative fluid management experienced more ventilator-free days and fewer ICU days\u2014this effect was true regardless of how fluid management was monitored. Although mortality did not differ between the two catheter groups, those managed with pulmonary artery catheters experienced more complications, illustrating the potential for iatrogenic complications in ALI. Taken together, multiple trials have shown that minimizing hydrostatic pressure improves physiology and ICU-related outcomes; the assuredness of this conservative fluid management is likely more important than the methods used to achieve it. These findings add support to the significance and complexity of pathology leading to the accumulation of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema fluid in ALI.",

Pathogenic bacteria are recognized by a family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which present the pathogen to the cell surface receptor CD14. Together, these receptors mobilize NF-\u03baB to the nucleus where it facilitates gene transcription of several proinflammatory factors. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (INF-\u03b1) stimulates other immune cells and leads to the production of nitric oxide, which promotes both killing of engulfed bacteria as well as tissue injury. Stimulated macrophages also produce interleukin (IL)-6, which activates endothelial cells, and IL-8, which recruits neutrophils to the site of injury.",
