            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, a member of the coronavirus family of respiratory viruses that includes SARS-CoV-1 and MERS. COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, has evolved into a global pandemic with more than 2,900,000 people infected. It has had an acute and dramatic impact on health care systems, economies, and societies of affected countries within these few months. Widespread testing and tracing efforts are employed in many countries in order to contain and mitigate this pandemic. Recent data has indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that the virus can be detected in wastewater. This indicates that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large populations at relevant scales. Collecting raw sewage data, representing specific districts, and crosslinking this data with the number of infected people from each location, will enable us to derive and provide quantitative surveillance tools. In particular, this will provide important means to (i) estimate the extent of outbreaks and their spatial distributions, based primarily on in-sewer measurements (ii) manage the early-warning system quantitatively and efficiently (and similarly, verify disease elimination). Here we report the development of a virus concentration method using PEG or alum, providing an important a tool for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage and relating it to the local populations and geographic information. This will provide a proof of concept for the use of sewage associated virus data as a reliable epidemiological tool.",

SARS-CoV-2 is one of more than 37 coronaviruses in the Coronaviridae family, within the order Nidovirales, and it is currently causing a major pandemic with over 2,900,000 people infected globally. It causes COVID-19, a disease that has daunting effect on health care systems, economies, and societies of affected countries. As a member of the Coronaviridae, which includes viruses known to cause respiratory and/or intestinal infections, SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily via micro droplets, reflecting its survivorship in humid environments (Chin et al. 2020 regarding polio by analyzing two unique data sets collected during a \"natural experiment\" All rights reserved.

In recent studies, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was reported to be present in wastewater in treatment facilities (Hindson et al. 2020; Medema et al. 2020; Naddeo and Liu 2020; Wurtzer et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020). Despite this, we are still lacking sufficient studies regarding the fate of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the different stages of wastewater collection and treatment. Presence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater provides a valuable epidemiological data source (Lodder & de Roda Husman, 2020). Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a new discipline concerned with mining chemical and biological information from municipal wastewater. WBE has been applied for populations around the globe to measure chemicals consumption and exposure patterns (Choi et al. 2019). It was proven to be useful for preclinical identification (i.e., before the population exhibited symptoms) of Aichi virus (Lodder & de Roda Husman, 2020), for monitoring antibiotic resistance on a global scale (Lodder & de Roda Husman 2020), for quantitative polio surveillance (Berchenko et al. 2017), and also as fecal indicators (Gu et al. 2018, Saeidi et al. 2018). In particular, in our previous work, (Berchenko et al. 2017) we obtained valuable epidemiological information",

Fresh 1 ml of raw sewage was taken directly into lysis buffer for RNA extraction. The rest of the sample was stored at -20 o C or -80 o C for virus concentration and RNA extraction stages.Sample concentration and analysis: Viral particles from approximately 0.25-1 liter of sewage/wastewater /effluent samples were concentrated using first centrifugation to remove sediment and large particles. Secondary concentration of the supernatant was performed using polyethylene glycol (PEG) or alum (20mg/l) precipitation, followed by additional centrifugation. The mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C with 100-rpm agitation for about 12h, then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 45 min at 4\u00b0C to pellet the virus particles. Virus particles were then resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The aqueous phase (containing virus particles) was collected and filtered through a 0.22\u00b5m filter. Ultra-15 centrifugal tubes with a molecular weight cutoff of 30 kDa (Amicon) were used to further concentrate the sample to a final volume of 1 ml. Samples were stored at -20/-80\u00b0C until further analysis. After primary and secondary concentrations, viral RNA was extracted from the samples using viral RNA extraction kit (RNeasy mini kit-QIAGEN and EasyMAG -bioMerieux, France) and then stored at -80\u00b0C.

Furthermore, the change observed in the Jerusalem sampling points from the end of March to 21 to April may demonstrate the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in the community.
