It is impossible to ignore his unfettered glee in pardoning white collar criminals (one of whom is Michael Milken, whose company once threatened to sue me for calling him a junk bond king) and in punishing any and all political opponents even if it means blatant lying, fabricating evidence, and manufacturing conspiracy theories. A dissimulating deification of the military is part of Trump\u2019s fascist imaginary\u2014a virtual space created after reality-based television \u2018it\u2019 factors presented in cin\u00e9ma verit\u00e9 mode, emphasizing events in such a way that they have a magnetic pull on viewers, usually through the makeshift milieu of the twitterverse but also in televised mass rallies that appeal to the scurrilous far-right of das Man. These are usually mudslinging conservatives, and persons of pedestrian discernment who feel nothing but pride when they are compared to troglodytes or paleo-Nazis. Trump\u2019s rallies also include frequent shout-outs to farmers, coal miners, truckers, and police officers where he can brag about rewarding white collar criminals with pardons and ennoble the racist, misogynist, and homophobe, Rush Limbaugh, whom he presented with the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor to the disgust of anyone with a thread of decency. Trump does not love America; he is tearing apart its moral fabric; he is forming the American public on the basis of social media\u2019s fake news and bringing vile and excremental ideas into the mainstream. Trump is as fake as the dreamy models in a Charlotte Tilbury \u2018pillow talk\u2019 advertisement although he is definitely not as easy to look at.",

Yet he remains energetic enough to pitch an \u2018us against them\u2019 ideology that has helped to shore up his electoral base. Trump\u2019s anti-globalist, anti-immigrant, and nationalist perspectives, his shamefaced retreat from the Constitution and the rule of law, his damning of the media outlets that give him unfavorable coverage as \u2018enemies of the people\u2019, and his pusillanimous, two-faced commitment to the betterment of the working-class have given heft to the possibility of American fascism being realized in a single generation, more so than at any other time since the decades prior to World War II.",

Devega (2020) remarks: \u2018Trump also manifests a condition where he thinks of himself a type of god. He leads a political cult united by cruelty and collective narcissism\u2019. Even prior to this, it was clear that Trump has a God complex. Consider the comment by Justin Frank: \u2018Trump does have a god complex. Trump reveals this through his constant use of the phrase \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d The only person who can say something like that is a person who believes they are a god, because only God can be all-knowing and see the future\u2019 (in Devega 2020) We can imagine without undue strain that Trump is a charlatan and Master of Chaos. He lives in his own self-contained world with its own laws, logic, and symbolic order, twisted into fanciful distortion when set against a system of intelligibility that requires a logic external to his vainglorious inner world that purports to bear any resemblance to sanity. Here the invariant coordinates of Trump\u2019s narcissism lead him directly into the vicinity of demagoguery and the playground of madmen. Frank points out, I believe correctly, that in addition to being an anger and rage addict, \u2018[o]n a basic level Donald Trump is the Jim Jones of American presidents\u2019 (in Devega 2020). And his base is drinking the poison carefully calibrated by Mar-a-Lago chefs into a Kool Aid Unsweetened Sharkleberry Fin Powdered Drink Mix.",

            "text": "Social life is heterogeneous and Trump and his critics certainly inhabit separate orders of reality resulting from a lifetime of different preunderstandings of the world. Both groups have been emplotted in the narrative of citizenship in different, often violently contrasting, ways. For Trump\u2019s base, the world is driven by the \u2018deep state\u2019 which is set up to keep elites in power at any cost, while Trump is putatively dedicated to destroying the deep state (notwithstanding the idea that Trump may, in fact, be the very apotheosis of the deep state he is attempting to demolish). For Trump\u2019s critics, the USA is hewed to democratic principles and organizations after centuries of hard-won struggle, and Trump is quickly unraveling these accomplishments with his temper tantrum presidency. Here opposing ideological predilections from these two distinct political tribes are sedimented over time into our cultural memory, spawning vastly different worldviews. Trump is sometimes described as an abusive father in relation to his Republican administration family, who, after being themselves tormented and publicly harassed by Trump, eventually begin to cross the dividing line to identify with their abusive father and then begin to abuse others in a similar fashion. Likewise, the Democrats began to perceive Adam Schiff as their father figure who was going to save them from Trump through the Mueller Report and then the impeachment process. Predictably, Democrats sat at home nervously waiting for Schiff\u2019s heroic endeavors to come to fruition instead of taking to the streets to protest. Was this the plan all along? All this was made possible by the narratives that framed the daily news both in the mainstream press and in a great deal of the social media. So now the two families have ramped up their antagonism toward each other and we are seeing what amounts to a postdigital rendition of the Hatfields versus the McCoys.",

Richard Wolf writes:The left needs to respond in three key ways. First, it should stress how world war and holocaust resulted the last time post-crash capitalism used nationalism for scapegoating. Second, it should expose scapegoat politics as aimed to deflect working class anger from a crash-prone capitalism. Immigration, trade, tariff policies, or European integration define capitalism\u2019s preferred terrain of debate, not a critical left\u2019s. The left\u2019s core response to capitalist nationalism should be this: capitalism is the problem and transition to a new, different, and fundamentally democratic system is the answer. (Wolff 2020)",

Social justice warriors are feared by those whose intellectual trajectory leads them to feed off the ideological ordure common among paleoconservatives\u2014that belief in egalitarianism and embracing progress under liberal auspices leads straight to work camps or the executioner. Social justice and totalitarianism appear inextricably braided together, eliciting a warning from the right that the left is coming to take away their freedoms and to eat their babies. This makes the right much more forthrightly hostile toward the left and as their souls begin to rot, they become plagued by their own imposing paranoia, turning themselves into vendors of downfall, desolation and degeneration, intellectual charlatans, and deskbound pedants unable to grasp the nettle of crisis-prone capitalist relations of production in triggering the alienation of the masses and culminating in the political cataclysms of the twentieth century. Their threadbare, aerosol theology has turned Christianity into a pagan ritual, and they would prefer to wear a red MAGA hat to a torrid Trump rally, enraptured by Trump\u2019s Adderall-infused embroidering of narcissistic narratives onto the political events of the day, than to read a line or two from Paul\u2019s epistles, or letters, to his various congregations (the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians).",

Maybe they assume that God keeps a tiny globe on his office desk that brandishes a big pin with \u2018number one\u2019 taped to its head, designating the location of the USA. Now that would not be such a bad idea if the pin could actually perform double duty as an acupuncture needle and bring some political ballast to the country. Trump has reconstituted the notion of American exceptionalism, remaking it into a Trumpist exceptionalism, which is little more than a con game where established institutional policies and practices are all delegitimated and then rejiggered for its main purpose: to keep Trump in power. This requires that institutions be structurally repurposed\u2014a process the Nazis called gleichschaltung which can be translated to mean \u2018reconstructing, reordering, re-gearing\u2019 (Lifton in Moyers 2020). The Nazis \u2018got rid of those who were unreliable, not reliable Nazis, [and] replaced them with reliable Nazis. And the institutions became sources of Nazi concepts and Nazi behavior\u2019 (Lifton in Moyers 2020). Trump has reorganized many US government institutional structures by replacing top administrators and directors with his most fanatical supporters who often lack any relevant skills to justify their appointments. It is unequivocally true that American evangelical Christianity (which is notoriously anti-Catholic) is a syncretic religion merging or assimilating American-style free market capitalism into its belief system, and thus asserting wide divergence on interpreting Jesus of the New Testament with regard to differentiating wealth, the idea that some people are poor while others are rich. But this syncresis is, nevertheless, not authorized in relation to other forms of capitalism, such as Keynesianism, since Fox News could never condone such a heresy.",

This is especially true during wartime, when the nation itself and the Bible join together to become a collective \u2018object of worship\u2019 revealing the destiny of America as an unerring march toward victory in its undiminished conquest of evil. In contrast, open exceptionalism views America as just one of many nations, none of which can lay claim to being God\u2019s sole or privileged instrument of salvation. The founding process of America was, for these early settler colonialists, an event that was caused by God\u2019s direct intervention into history, hence, predisposing \u2018authentic\u2019 Christians against liberals and progressives that has continued over the centuries right up to this day. Christian principles, therefore, had to be integrated into governmental bureaucratic operations in order to keep the nation from falling apart and the struggle is still ongoing, evoking the nation\u2019s putative providential past. A recent report by Max Boot, cited by Mathew Chapman (2020), reveals that American jingoists are nothing short of delusory when it comes to boasting about the current world-historical greatness of the United States. Blaming decades of Republican anti-government ideology for its failure to handle the current Covid-19 pandemic, Boot offers a sober assessment of the nation\u2019s status as a whole:\u2018\u2026.we lag in almost every measure of societal well-being among the wealthy nations (now 36) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),\u2019 wrote Boot. \u2018As of 2016, we had the second-highest poverty rate, the highest level of income inequality and the highest level of obesity. We spent the most on education but produced less-than-average results. We were also below average on renewable energy, infrastructure investment and voter turnout. We are the only OECD nation that doesn\u2019t mandate paid family leave. One area where we do lead is gun violence. Our homicide rate is nearly 50 percent above the OECD average.\u2019 (Boot in Chapman 2020)",

The US bombings of Cambodia created the conditions of possibility for the Khmer Rouge to take over the country and begin 4 years of mass killings.

As far as their splendid inattention to any hermeneutics of suspicion goes, or their bad faith theology is concerned, I am not preoccupied with lingering aporias or irresolvable paradoxes braided into various scriptural garments and insistently thrust into our national brainpan. Nor am I occupying a position that pushes paradoxicality to the point that denies all claims to truth. And I\u2019m not working alongside a Skunk Works project with a bunch of technologically determinist nerdballs and end-timers who are desperately trying to create an app that will enable the public to connect directly with God. The closest that this Sky Marshall Commando Cody cyber breed of industry oddballs has come to creating such an app is when they created a Twitter account for Donald Trump\u2019s self-worship. As devotees of Donald Trump struggle to survive the Covid-19, from the dirt paths of tumbledown hillside ghettos to the luxury vinyl tiled floors of high-end shopping plazas in major metropolises, the pastor of church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by the name of Rev. Tony Spell, is defying an order from Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards against large gatherings in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, because the good Reverend Spell believes the handling of the coronavirus pandemic is \u2018politically motivated\u2019 (Palma 2020). In fact, he noted that on Sundays he brings in 27 buses packed with parishioners. He recently boasted: \u2018I had 1,170 in attendance Sunday\u2019 (Palma 2020). He further justified his actions by claiming that his church heals a wide array of ailments: \u2018Our church is a hospital where the sick can come and get healing\u2026 he said. Cancers are healed here, people are healed of HIV in these services. \u2026 And tonight, we\u2019re also going to pass out anointed handkerchiefs to people who may have fear, who may have a sickness \u2014 and we believe that when those anointed handkerchiefs go, a healing virtue is going to go on them as well\u2019 (Palma 2020). The self-promoting pastor has since been charged with a misdemeanor violation of the governor\u2019s orders. As political power tilts towards the malignant forces of authoritarian capitalism, it is no secret that big-box revivalist preachers want in on the action, even if that puts the lives of their flock and other constituencies at potential risk during a pandemic. As a Catholic who has visited a wide array of religious sites all over the world and occasionally witnessed events that appeared to defy scientific explanation, I am not against the idea of miracles, but I am against pitting triumphalist faith against scientific common sense.

Drawing on the work of Vincent Miller, Campbell and Garner note that \u2018across Amish and other Mennonite communities there is a common practice of discernment and understanding around technology and media.\u2019 And that this discernment is \u2018grounded in an ecclesiology structured to produce full accountability between individual members of the church and the will and discernment of the larger group\u2019 (Campbell and Garner 2016: 137). Miller\u2019s work is instructive on the importance of communitarian decision-making. As indicated by Campbell and Garner, Miller implicates technology here in the perception of time in that,we tend to focus on a more instrumental view of time (chronos), which allows us to order, manage, and control the world, rather than a more relational view of time (kairos) that comprises moments of meaning within a narrative of life. It is this relational view of time, seen in the New Testament (e.g., Gal. 4:4; Titus 1;1\u20133) to represent defining moments in history, that is captured in the approach to appropriate technology. Rather than concentrating on managing time and relationships, we should work on using and applying technology to create meaning and true relationships in our individual and communal lives. In this respect, the Amish community\u2019s approach to technology is connected to an experience or notion of time that serves the community rather than the other way around.

Would it privilege the individual over against the community?\u2019 For the Amish community, therefore, \u2018the community rather than individuals makes technological decisions; technology is not necessarily evil, so it can be used with caution; and the use of technology can potentially undermine the community and its core values\u2019 (Campbell and Garner 2016: 137\u2013138).

Examples include the construction of sites of worship such as cathedrals; the development of written texts such as the Bible or prayer books; (\u2026) the technological environment we inhabit shapes the way we worship and the way we behave in the context of worship and the Christian life.

It is indispensable to my portraying the debates over liberation theology since it sets an emotional tone, provides an invocatory power and creates a dramatic resonance among the class that enables them to appreciate the project of liberation theology even, and sometimes especially, among atheists.

The argument that guns do not kill people, people kill people, that is sometimes hijacked to describe media technology reminds me of the logic embedded in the argument that technology is neutral. But technology cannot be separated from the myriad ways in which it is situated in its deployment. Technology does not stand above history as some insurmountable universal tool, like the lightning bolt of Zeus; it is not forged solely through the inner determination of capital, nor should it be capable playing the final role of the arbiter of history. Each use we make of technology has to be understood within its contextual specificity. In the case of using the film Romero in the classroom, one has to consider the ideological presuppositions of the viewers, the interplay between long-past and present-day structural determinations that make manifest our ability to interrogate the themes, and what aspect of the political informs the pedagogical praxis of the educator\u2014just to name a few considerations. To argue that technology is neutral could easily promote the idea of placing religious symbols in public spaces and to make the argument that religion must have a privileged place in the public sphere if civilization is to be kept in place. And we must continually ask: How can a Christian claim to be against Christian nationalism, while failing to protest and vociferously denounce the banning of immigrants from Muslim countries from entering the USA?

His work, Cybertheology (2016), is heavily grounded in the work of Teilhard de Chardin and Marshall McLuhan. Spandaro argues that it is precisely Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s theological framework that provides the necessary theological mindset and aggregate of conceptual religious categories to enable us to understand both the history of technology and technological advances up to the present, in particular the Web. For Spanaro, the Internet marks an important connective stage in humanity\u2019s journey of spiraling upwards toward God, guided by a cyberspatial eschatology provided by a cyberspatial eschatology provided by avatars of episteme who glide down the corridors of Google fame like the ghosts of Hogwarts, cloaked in robes festooned with algorithms.

Saving one\u2019s soul is favorably compared by Spanaro to saving a personal computer file. The Web, which has become part of a divine milieu, operates out of a particular system of intelligibility (participative logic and user-generated content) that only theological intuition can most fully explain. The virtual world now represents the divine intellect, of a type of self-thinking thought (thought that thinks itself) such that what was once theological has now become technological. Technology has helped to bring civilization closer to the Omega point, an open vision of transcendence, a point of divine convergence with the noosphere and the cosmic Christ. This journey, strangely enough, began with a microphone placed on a church altar which allowed the congregation to enter into an immediate relation with the speaker. The author frequently turns to McLuhan for an explanation: \u2018We observe in the liturgy that the acoustic amplification overloads our auditory sensorial channels, lowering the threshold of attention to the visual and individual experience of the liturgy so that it isolates the individual in a sound bubble within the architectural space\u2019 (Sparado 2014: 72). Of course, Spadaro also addresses the problems of \u2018forking\u2019 with the use of open source software and discusses issues inherent to what he calls open source theology. While I find some of Spanaro\u2019s observations provocative, the entire work, which is admittedly Christocentric, does give off the odor of Christian triumphalism on one too many occasions. I immediately wanted to know whether the theological probes (a term I have borrowed from McLuhan) used by Spanaro can be applied, say, to Buddhism, or to Islam, or possibly to Umbanda (Santer\u00eda, Candombl\u00e9) or Wicca. And I am highly skeptical that the creation of the Internet has, according to Spandaro, proven Marx\u2019s critique of political economy to be wrong. Are we truly on an evolutionary path to cosmic intelligence via self-organization, auto-catalytic networks and biotechnological advances? Can we find Christ in technology and evolution, as Teilhard de Chardin proclaims? Do we need to wait for theologians to set the terms for merging with the pleroma or can we robustly engage the transhumanists without the Vatican\u2019s approval? Or is there a way for Christian communities and transhumanists to work together cheek by jowl?",

While clearly Trump should be adjudicated into a penal colony, that is very unlikely to happen while Trump is still president and considered by inveterate end-timers to be chosen by God to rule the American Throne with an iron fist. A critique of Trump from a Christian perspective, using Christ\u2019s teachings as a measure would, for instance, be the most effective way to reveal the danger he poses to democracy and civilization itself. For example, the crumbs that Trump threw to his base with his tax cuts can be revealed to be a charade when one considers the emphasis that the Bible places on economic conditions and poverty. Meacham writes:[Martin Luther] King had been deeply influenced by the theologian Walter Rauschenbusch and his 1907 book \u2018Christianity and the Social Crisis,\u2019 which argued that Jesus called the world not simply to contemplate but to act. \u2018The Gospel at its best deals with the whole man, not only his soul but his body, not only his spiritual well-being, but his material well-being,\u2019 King wrote in a Rauschenbusch-inspired passage. \u2018Any religion that professes to be concerned about the souls of men and is not concerned about the slums that damn them, the economic conditions that strangle them and the social conditions that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion awaiting burial\u2019 (Meacham 2020)",

What is the relationship between the owners of the means of technological production and those struggling for a socialist alternative to capitalism (McLaren and Jandri\u0107 2020b)? I have no problem with technology being invented or used to pursue worldly dreams that might help ease the needless suffering of humanity, or to participate in finding hope in a hopeless world, but it is clear to me that more needs to be done to liberate technology from the white-knuckled vice-grip of corporate Christian fundamentalists and to liberate Christianity from the perils and pitfalls of technological \u2018progress\u2019 and to encourage a more nuanced and granular understanding of how technology might enable a project of faith and hope\u2014including how the Gospel messages themselves might be better embodied (enfleshed) through technological advances, without having to retrofit humanity on a massive scale with biomechatronic body parts.",

That\u2019s what\u2019s paradoxical. There are people who hope for things but do not do anything to achieve that outcome. When a person is denying helplessness by hoping that things will work out, they are also acting helpless by hoping that somebody else is going to save them and somehow everything will work out. Hope can be an abdication of responsibility as a way of protecting oneself against anxiety. The hope-peddlers are behaving as though they are addicted on an unconscious level to death, because they are denying the work that is necessary to stay alive by protecting the USA.

This has driven many politically progressive Christians to embrace a fatalistic despair and to cling to an abstract hope divorced from the arena of concrete struggle. For Americans facing an epic choice during the presidential election in November 2020, the stakes are brutally high. Hope is not something that can be invoked as a magical talisman that calls upon supernatural forces to intervene on our behalf. To activate revolutionary change, hope must always be bonded with struggle. And if this includes communing with God in cyberspace, then I can only wish that the ultrahumanist vision of our dear Jesuit paleontologist, Teilhard de Chardin, will lead to the eventual enhancement and deepening of biological life rather than its transcendence. It is time for a de-transcendence, a time for us to meet the poor on their own terms, a time for us to repristinate the commons and expand its democratic sphere, a time to deepen its connection to the people rather than be blown through the history of pain and suffering like Benjamin\u2019s Angel of History, with a storm caught in its wings, its neck wrenched backwards, forced to look upon the dung heap of humanity's glorious achievements.",
