            "text": "For the past 150 years urbanization has been a major historical trend, driving changes in economic development, education, criminal justice, transportation and housing, to name a few (Moore, Gould, & Keary, 2003; Vlahov & Galea, 2003; Lawrence, 1999; Satterthwaite, 2000). Today, city life is the norm for an ever growing proportion of the world's population. Recent projections suggest that half of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2007 and three-quarters by 2030 (United Nations Population Division, 2002; Gelbard, Haub, & Kent, 1999). The urban environment influences every aspect of health and well-being: what people eat, the air they breathe and the water they drink, where (or if) they work, the housing that shelters them, their sex partners and family arrangements, where they go for health care, the danger they encounter on the street, and who is available for emotional and financial support. In the modern era, cities have been both the source of serious threats to the health of the public and the source of many public health innovations. More than ever, to understand what causes health and disease and to improve the health of the public requires an improved awareness of how characteristics of cities affect health and well-being. In this paper we first discuss the dominant approaches that are used in the study of urban health and then propose an integrative framework that can build on these approaches and guide public health inquiry into how urban characteristics affect health. We draw primarily on the US experience in discussing this framework but hope that our rationale for inclusion of specific elements in the framework can have broad applications to a range of countries. We intend this framework to serve as a model that can guide interventions aimed at improving health in cities.",

            "text": "Research on the association between city living and health arises from several disciplines, including anthropology, urban planning, epidemiology, and sociology, and has focused on assessing differences between and within cities. Researchers have generally used one of three different approaches to considering the association between cities and health. The first, and most common approach, contrasts urban to non-urban (frequently rural) areas (e.g., van Niekerk, Weinberg, Shore, De V. Heese, & van Schalkwyk, 1979; Farbos, Resnikoff, & Peyramure, 2000; Telfair, Haque, Etienne, Tang, & Strasser, 2003). This work isolates living in urban areas as a primary determinant of interest and has often produced conflicting results. For example, while higher rates of mental illness have been documented in urban compared to rural areas in the United Kingdom (Paykel, Abbott, Jenkins, Burgha, & Meltzer, 2002), rural-urban differences in mental health have not been observed in Canada (Parikh, Wasylenki, Goering, & Wong, 1996) even though the studies used comparable methodology. In the US, some studies have documented urban-rural differences in mental health (Blazer et al., 1985) while others have found no differences (Blazer, Kessler, McGonagle, & Swartz, 1994). A study in Taiwan found a lower prevalence of mental health problems in urban compared to rural areas (Hwu, Yeh, & Chang, 1989). Studies of the prevalence of heart disease and cancer by urban vs. rural regions have similarly showed inconsistencies (e.g., Yamamoto & Watanabe, 2001).",

We refer to this body of work in this paper as the study of urban health. Much of this work has suggested that urban residents have worse health than non-urban residents, a disparity sometimes called the urban health penalty (Gould, 1998; Freudenberg, Galea, & Vlahov, under review). However it is now evident that cities have positive as well as negative effects on health and well-being. For example, social and health services are frequently more available in cities than they are in non-urban areas (Sorgaard et al., 2003) which may contribute to better health and well-being among urban residents. In contrast, particulate pollution is higher in cities, particularly heavily industrialized cities, than it is in non-urban areas (Grima, Micallef, & Colls, 2002; Jedrychowski, Maugeri, & Bianchi, 1997). Particulate pollution has been associated with respiratory and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality (Shima, Nitta, Ando, & Adachi, 2002; Crimi et al., 1999).",

In part, this limitation reflects the difficulty of parsing the complex set of questions that are embedded in the concept of urban health into evaluable components. Cities may have both positive and negative effects on health, suggesting that a full understanding of urban health needs to tease apart the factors that influence health and evaluate the circumstances, and the contexts, in which one factor may be more or less important than another. In addition, particular urban characteristics may have both positive and negative effects on health. For example, while city parks and green space may have a salutary effect on health (Takano, Nakamura, & Watanabe, 2002), these same areas may provide breeding sites for vectors that transmit infectious diseases (Miller, 2001).",

However, if the same city were gentrifying and old housing was being renovated, the demolition and rebuilding could expose urban residents to displaced rodents, changing neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, and loss of well-established neighborhood social resources, all of which could affect health. Therefore, a fuller understanding of urban health will necessitate studies that include an appreciation of the dynamic nature of cities, the specificity of context, and a detailed consideration of the pathways by which changes in the urban context affect health.",

Thus, the inter-city studies of urban health suggest that municipal-level factors (e.g., policies) may be important determinants of the health of city residents (Rondinelli, 1986; Jerrett, Eyles, Dufournaud, & Birch, 2003). Studies that have focused on differences within cities suggest that intra-urban factors (e.g., residential segregation) play a role in shaping health (Acevedo-Garcia, 2001). Ultimately however, it is the multiplicity of factors at different levels that shape the health of urban residents. For example, municipal-level policies determine transportation routes that may pollute local neighborhood environments or increase accident rates while at the same time improving access to emergency medical services. State and federal authorities, influenced by national political and economic factors, allocate funds for the establishment of new roads or other types of transportation in cities. All levels play a role in determining how transportation affects the health of urban residents. While this complex causal chain is not unique to urban health, it is particularly germane given the complexity of the urban context.",

Here, we propose a framework that posits that urban populations are defined by size, density, diversity and complexity, and that health in urban populations is a function of living conditions shaped by municipal determinants, and national and global trends. We propose a framework that can be used in all three dominant research strands discussed above, i.e., to study intra-urban differences in the health of populations, to compare the health of groups across cities, or to frame contrasts between urban and non-urban populations. The rest of this paper discusses the proposed framework and how the different levels of influence may contribute to health in cities.",

            "text": "Before considering the components of the model presented in the columns, we note that in the bottom row we highlight the role of enduring social structures and conditions. This reflects the prevailing political and economic systems that underlie all aspects of living in particular countries. For example, in the US, representative democracy and capitalism provide the context in which social conditions that affect health can change. In other countries, more authoritarian governments, more robust working class movements, or more centrally planned economies provide a different context in which conditions that affect health can change. While social structures are not immutable, they usually change on a slower time scale than what we call major national and international trends. Since social alterations occur only in the context of these political, social and economic structures, it is important to understand how they enable or constrain other determinants that may influence the health of urban populations. For example, free market capitalism, whether in its more regulated or unfettered models, shapes the opportunity structures in which individuals, corporations, and governments take action related to health. Being ultimately interested in modifiable urban living conditions and their proximal determinants, we do not here focus further on these more enduring social structures, but acknowledge their overall importance in shaping the other components highlighted in this framework. In the past, social movements seeking to modify these structures have made important contributions to improved living conditions, suggesting that such efforts may again emerge in the future (Hamlin, 1998; Piven & Cloward, 1979). In the proposed framework we also denote, using vertical arrows, the fact that enduring structures are likely to play a role in shaping the other key elements in the framework, including national and global trends, municipal determinants, public health practice, and more proximal urban characteristics.",

The number of legal immigrants entering the US during the 1980s doubled compared to the 1950s. In 2000, 31.1 million US residents, 11.1% of the population, were foreign born and 13.2 million of these, or 4.7% of the overall population, came to the United States between 1990 and 2000 (Bureau of the Census, 2001). Immigration to western countries has had a disproportionate effect on cities for much of the past century, with most immigrants settling in urban areas upon arrival to a developed nation (Briggs, 1998).",

Studies show that immigrants bring lifestyles and support systems that protect them against some of the adverse outcomes that other low-income urban residents experience, such as infant mortality and diabetes (Morales, Lara, Kington, Valdez, & Escarce, 2002). However, some of these protections fade after a generation or two of exposure to urban conditions (Durkin, 1998; Allensworth, 1997). On the other hand immigrants from some regions are often burdened with poverty and a higher prevalence of some diseases (e.g., tuberculosis) than long-term residents of the host country (Sakala, 1987; Cowie, Field, & Enarson, 2002). Providing health care to the growing number of immigrants, especially in big cities, can also be a problem (Wakabayashi, 1990). Children of immigrants face the task of balancing old and new worlds, a tension that, albeit relatively poorly studied, may affect health (Hernandez, 1999). Many immigrants to the US lack insurance coverage, face language and cultural barriers to medical care, and fear that encounters with public authorities, including health care providers, may lead to legal problems including deportation (Morales et al., 2002; Smith, 2001).",

Overtaxed sanitary systems directly may lead to rapid spread of disease in cities as has been the case many times in North America during the past century and as continues to be the case in the developing world today (Ezcurra & Mazari-hiriart, 1996; Gutierrez et al., 1996; Lesne, 1998). Also, the population strain on available jobs may result in falling wages, higher unemployment, or other declines in socio-economic status for persons previously living in a given city; these factors have frequently been associated with poor health (Lin, Rogot, Johnson, Sorlie, & Arias, 2003). Immigration has also been associated with widening income disparities in cities (Slottje & Hayes, 1987). In some cities, immigration has become a contentious political issue, leading to conflict over public resources, including health care (The Atlantic Monthly, 1996).",

            "text": "Suburbanization, or the movement of people from city center to surrounding areas, has been one of the hallmarks of growing urban areas in wealthy countries over the past 50 years. For example, between the 1940s and the 1990s, millions of middle class Americans left cities for the surrounding suburbs (Dreier, Mollenkopf, & Swanstrom, 2001). This migration led to dramatic reductions in population size, density, diversity and resources in many cities. The population of Cleveland, Ohio, for example decreased from 915,000 people in 1950 to fewer than 500,000 in 2000 (Dreier et al., 2001). These changes had substantial implications. Even though Cleveland now has 400,000 fewer people (and a smaller tax base) than it did 40 years ago, mostly poorer than before, it still has to maintain the same streets, sewers and water lines (Dreier et al., 2001). The exodus also deprived cities of many of the people who had been civic leaders, depleting urban social capital. As conditions in inner cities further deteriorated in the 1970s and 1980s, many middle class minorities also left, making it even harder for these communities to cope with changing economic and social circumstances (Wilson, 1987, Wilson, 1996). Residential suburbanization supported a parallel movement of jobs. Lower land costs and an educated workforce encourage some employers to move, reducing job opportunities in the city (Altshuler, Morrill, Wolman, & Mitchell, 1999). Suburbanization also put new demands on the physical environment\u2014factories once confined to urban industrial zones now polluted wider areas, new highways increased automobile traffic and pollution, and new housing reduced the amount of open space and tree cover that had surrounded cities (Frumkin, 2002). The evolution of large areas of urban development extending well beyond the traditional metropolitan boundaries has been referred to as \u201curban sprawl\u201d and associated with a number of problems including increased pollution, changing exercise patterns, and poor water quality (Frumkin, 2002).",

In the last two decades, for example, problems such as HIV infection, tuberculosis, drug use and violence (Wallace, & Wallace, 1993, Wallace, & Wallace, 1997; Wallace, 2001) have moved both within and between metropolitan regions. During the period of tuberculosis (TB) resurgence in New York, the TB incidence rates in suburban counties were associated with the proportion of residents commuting to the city, as well as with the county's population density and poverty rate (Wallace, 2001). Various urban lifestyles spread first from city to suburb and then to the country as a whole. For example, heroin, crack and HIV infection first spread in urban sub-populations in the 1970s and 1980s, but were then disseminated throughout the country. On a more positive note, consumption of tropical fruits and vegetables, and exercise trends, starting in big cities, have also now proliferated throughout the country (Popkin, 2001; United States Department of Agriculture, 2002).",

The federal government did not provide help to the city in what is still considered, to this day, the most difficult period in New York City's modern history (Tabb, 1982). Some health researchers argue that these government decisions contributed to the resurgence of TB in the late 1970s and to the rapid spread of HIV infection and crack addiction among the city's most vulnerable populations (Brudney & Dobney, 1991; Wallace & Wallace, 1991).",

In the last 25 years, more government functions have devolved to state and local governments; taxes have been cut at the federal, state and local levels, some environmental and consumer regulations have been loosened, and many previously public services (e.g. sanitation, water, health care) have been privatized (Katz, 1989; Gans, 1995). This devolution of responsibility to lower levels of government has contributed to underfunded social and public health systems failing to meet emerging health threats. For example, limited regulation of municipal water supplies has been considered at least in part responsible for water-borne disease outbreaks in different North American cities (Krewski et al., 2002; Corso et al., 2003; Garrett, 2001). Fire station closings in New York City have been associated with an increase in significant structural fires in the City (Wallace & Wallace, 1999).",

Since many manufacturing corporations were located in or near cities, their departure led to reduced municipal revenues, unemployment and population loss. Combined with the losses of people and jobs to the suburbs, these changes had significant effects on some cities. For example, between 1975 and 1995 Detroit lost a third of its population but doubled its poverty rate (World Resources Institute, 1996). Also, in the first half of the 20th century, manufacturing jobs had attracted immigrants and provided a pathway out of poverty for many urban residents and sustained municipal tax bases and economies (Bluestone & Harrison, 1982; Wilson, 1987, Wilson, 1996). Their loss contributed to urban unemployment and underemployment, poverty, and increasing racial and class segregation (Wilson, 1996; Jargowsky, 1997; Goldsmith & Blakely, 1992; Massey & Denton, 1993).",

Lack of transportation has been identified as one determinant of low employment levels in inner cities (Wilson, 1996). Effective traffic management reduces automobile injuries and deaths and speeds the delivery of emergency medical services. Studies show that more densely populated cities have worse cardiovascular survival, perhaps due to the longer response times of emergency medical and fire services trying to reach persons after unexpected cardiac events (Lombardi, Gallagher, & Gennis, 1994).",

Despite an unprecedented period of economic prosperity in the 1990s, the number of people who were homeless actually increased during that period in the US (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2002). For example, New York City, which led the 1990s\u2019 national prosperity in the US, had a shortage of 250,000\u2013500,000 housing units at the end of the decade (Coalition for the Homeless, 2002). While homelessness has many determinants, most observers agree that the fundamental cause of the increase in homelessness was a decreasing supply of affordable low-income housing (Foscarinis, 1991). Housing investors made higher profits in high and middle income housing markets, government reduced support for subsidized housing, and the housing market was unable to meet this pressing demand, placing hundreds of thousands of mostly urban residents at risk for homelessness. Homelessness has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes (Brickner & Scallan, 1986).",

Cities today generally have higher concentrations of poor people, people of color, and recent immigrants compared to non-urban areas (Bureau of the Census, (2002), Bureau of the Census, (2001)), contributing to the higher prevalence of poverty-associated diseases. More millionaires also live in urban than in non-urban areas, contributing to greater income disparities in cities that have been associated with adverse health outcomes (Blakely, Lochner, & Kawachi, 2002). Second, changes in the knowledge, skills, culture or behavior of people living in cities can also influence health. For example, as urban middle class residents join fitness centers, they increase their own levels of physical activity and set an example for other groups to follow (Managed Care Interface Stats & facts, 2000).",

A recent review of published reports on health interventions designed to reduce selected health problems in US cities found that the first and last strategies, changing individuals and health care services, were the most frequently used methods and that few interventions intervened on more than one or two levels (Freudenberg et al., 2000).

In discussing how factors such as global trends and municipal factors affect the social and physical environments that proximally define the urban context, this framework places the health of urban populations within the larger regional, national, and global context. This framework then illustrates how the health of urban populations, rather than being only a product of local forces (such as, for example, the built physical environment), inevitably reflects larger processes. In recognizing that there are multiple determinants of the health of urban populations, our framework adds to the growing study of population health as a distinct field that incorporates considerations ranging from the broader economic context to individual behavior and genetics as potential determinants of the health of populations (Kindig & Stoddart, 2003). In so doing, this framework suggests that some influences on urban health may have broad applicability around the world. For example, the framework suggests that policy makers in both developed and developing nations need to consider the health impact of policies designed either to promote, or discourage, suburbanization.",

For example, we can consider the question of how mass transit systems affect health. Our framework allows one level of analysis relating to the congestion and confinement of people in subways where the risk of air-borne transmission of infectious diseases, dispersion of bio-terror agents, commission of violent crime, or emission of debilitating noise can affect people across racial, ethnic, income and neighborhood boundaries. This approach considers the health effects of unique urban features. Alternatively, investigators could work on another level, examining municipal determinants (e.g., how the mass transit system is managed and financed, local incentives and penalties for automobile use), and national trends (e.g., declining federal support for cities and mass transit). Each level of analysis suggests directions for intervention to improve health.",

Global trends in liberalization or restriction of trade then affect movement of food between countries and markets. Within cities, efficacy of food inspection mechanisms depends to a large extent on municipal policies and resources made available for regular food inspections. In turn, food intake has been shown to differ between neighborhoods within cities (Diez-Roux et al., 1999). Therefore, factors at multiple levels all ultimately affect food choices in cities and contribute to health or disease. Researchers studying the issue of how food affects health in urban areas can consider global and national levels, municipal levels, and inter-neighborhood variability, as they are related to the risk for heart disease, cancer, obesity, or chronic hunger within cities. Findings can guide national or state food policies, municipal-level interventions, or community campaigns.",

While we think that there is much to be gained by considering the US experience, it is worth emphasizing that the relative importance of characteristics of the urban environment that may affect health may vary substantially in different cities and in different parts of the world. For example, in many rapidly growing urban areas, the provision of safe water and sanitation is likely to account for a greater proportion of the morbidity and mortality in a specific city than are all the other factors identified here. As cities become more established, an aging physical infrastructure and strains on health and social services can both influence health behaviors and access to resources. Many of these international differences of necessity are substantially simplified in the framework. Different enduring structures, for example, can make for critical differences in the substance and style of municipal governance, with implications for public health practice, characteristics of cities, and health. In addition, the course of urbanization in different cities worldwide may have different implications for health. A newly urbanizing city is likely to be under different, and probably more substantial, strains than is a long-established urban area. Therefore, when applying the proposed framework to a consideration of how cities may affect health it is important for the public health researcher or practitioner to consider both place, i.e., the particulars of a given city, and time, i.e., the trajectory of urbanization in a particular city. There are no simple solutions that can summarize the relations between the different factors that can affect health in different countries. Rather, specific investigations and interventions would benefit from a systematic assessment of relevant local and temporal contexts, which the framework proposed here can guide, in order to inform intervention efforts in a given urban area. We hope that this paper stimulates the development of other frameworks that may better reflect how the urban context shapes health across countries and continents.",

First, cities continue to grow and a majority of people in both developed and developing nations will be living in urban areas throughout the 21st century (United Nations Populations Division, 2002). Second, although some estimates of the prevalence of various health conditions suggest that the burden of disease in cities is greater than that in non-urban areas, this has not always been the case historically and is certainly not a consistent observation across cities and diseases today (Judd et al., 2002). Similarly, although academic discourse often assumes that cities have a deleterious effect on health, there are also many positive and health-enhancing aspects of cities and the urban context. Third, in order to understand urban health we must shift our focus of inquiry away from disease outcomes toward urban exposures, namely, the characteristics of the urban context that influence health and well-being in cities. Fourth, the study of urban health must acknowledge the reality of complexity. There are no simple solutions, no magic bullets for the multidimensional health problems facing cities today. This complexity can itself cause or exacerbate problems, where a response to one part of a problem can precipitate an accident or disastrous unintended consequences (Perrow, 1999). Approaches that recognize the importance of studying interactions at multiple levels are a useful tool for the study of urban health (Diez-Roux, 2000; Vlahov & Galea, 2003). Fifth, many disciplines need to contribute to the study of cities. New methodologies in epidemiology, geography, and the quantitative social sciences, insights from anthropologists, psychologists and historians, and the technical contributions of engineers, architects, and urban planners are among the strands that will contribute to a science of urban health.",
