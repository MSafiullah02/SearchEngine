[1] [2] [3] [4] As a respiratory virus infection, the transmission of the SARS coronavirus could be affected by environmental factors, including meteorological variables, such as air pressure, relative humidity and temperature. Such weather factors may be possible elements in the prediction of infectious disease transmission, including mosquito and rodentborne diseases, respiratory infections, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and more recently, SARS transmission. [10] [11] [12] [13] In developing emergency plans to contain the spread, transmission and resurgence as well as to prevent further international spread of new communicable diseases including SARS, it is important to set up early warning systems, using practical indices as markers for infectious disease transmission dynamics. These indices include pathogen infectivity, contact degree and frequency, population immunity and environmental factors. The use of weather variables may provide an additional potential tool for such projection. Given the need to remain vigilant about SARS worldwide, and the resurgence of the disease in late May 2003 in Toronto 14 and 2004 in Beijing, 15 the study of the association of weather to SARS transmission is timely. This paper quantifies the relationship between weather variables and the number of cases of SARS occurring on a daily basis in the epidemic of 2003 in Beijing and Hong Kong. The above study period was chosen for Beijing because, from 21 April to 20 May 2003, the Chinese government publicly opened its disease surveillance system, and the dataset over this period is believed to be more reliable than data collected outside these dates.

It is known that large droplets are the likely primary mode of transmission; however, in some circumstances, clusters of SARS cases suggest an aerosol transmission or direct contact. Therefore, transmission may be heterogeneous. Experience in Toronto, 19 Taiwan, 20 and elsewhere 21 also indicates that the primary mode of SARS transmission is through respiratory droplets and direct contact with patients and their contaminated environment.

SARS has since spread rapidly around the world, with cases reported from 30 countries over five continents. From 1 November 2002 to 7 August 2003, there were 8422 reported cases, with 916 deaths. The countries and regions most seriously affected were China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada.1 Hong Kong and Beijing were chosen as target cities in this study because they were the worst hit with the most SARS cases (1755 and 2521, respectively) occurring during the epidemic, but with different climatic conditions (subtropical and temperate).Target cases for this study were laboratory-confirmed cases from both Beijing and Hong Kong, and the World Health Organization (WHO) definition was followed.
