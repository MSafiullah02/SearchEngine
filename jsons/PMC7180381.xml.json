Prevention and control strategies currently focused on vector control, including insecticide treatment, environmental management and social mobilization have not been effective in practice. It is widely recognized that no strategy alone can fully address the problem. However, some intervention tools have helped reduce the disease burden. For example, timely access to clinical services and appropriate care can reduce mortality dramatically [12], indoor residual spraying (IRS) and indoor space spraying (ISS) may be effective in reducing mosquito populations and exposure to arboviruses [11]. In addition, personal protection, clinical diagnosis and management, laboratory-based surveillance and vaccination, can be effective [12]. Vaccines are available to protect against Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever [13], and the first dengue vaccine, even though limited in its applications, was licensed in 2015 [14].",

Similarly, a new strain of CHIKV emerged in East Africa in 2004, spreading to Asia and then to the rest of the tropical world in 10 years [8].

In 2007\u20132010 yellow fever emerged and expanded into the south and southeastern parts of Brazil, where yellow fever vaccination was not common. Then, in 2014\u201315, it emerged in Central Brazil, infecting many travelers. Cases of yellow fever were exported from Brazil to Europe, Peru and the USA. The virus continued to spread in 2017\u201318 into the areas of Bahia, Rio and Sao Paolo and was detected in 4266 municipalities, causing small urban epidemics [15]. The death toll increased to 235 persons in 2017 and 409 in the first half of 2018. In Africa, yellow fever spread from Angola to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016\u201317, and emerged in Nigeria and Uganda in 2018 [16]. More dramatically, 11 cases were imported from Angola to China, which is the first time in history that confirmed yellow fever was introduced to Asia [6]!",

He suggested that all at-risk countries should have an enhanced passive disease surveillance system based on well-defined case definitions supported by serological and virological laboratory testing. Three major arbovirus pathologies should be monitored: systemic febrile syndrome, haemorrhagic disease syndrome, and meningo-encephalitis syndrome. An active laboratory-based syndromic surveillance network is also badly needed.

As an example, laboratory testing for dengue is important in order to distinguish the disease from other febrile illnesses such as malaria, leptospirosis or influenza, other arbovirus diseases such as Chikungunya, Zika, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis or yellow fever, and even from typhoid/paratyphoid (Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi spp bacteria). Recently, WHO has recommended the serotesting of individuals in dengue vaccination settings to screen out those with no evidence of past infection.",

Standard dengue diagnostics assays include RT-PCR, virus neutralization assays, immunoassays to detect DENV NS1 antigen, and assays to detect anti-DENV IgMs [ref]. The most sensitive and specific assays are RT-PCR and the NS1 ELISA assay. Low-cost point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are currently not adequate for the clinical and vaccination settings, while ELISA, RT-PCR and other strategies with much higher levels of performance are are too slow and costly. The latter tests are needed in public health surveillance and research settings. These diagnostic approaches are instrument-dependent and require appropriate facilities and highly trained technical staff to perform complex diagnostic tests, unfortunately none of which are available in resource-limited areas. Dengue diagnostics will greatly benefit from a Dengue POC test that meets the WHO ASSURED criteria (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, Rapid, User-friendly and Delivered to those in need) [20]. Note that laboratory diagnosis of dengue can be achieved with a single serum specimen obtained during the febrile phase of the illness by testing for DENV nucleic acid, non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and anti-DENV IgMs. The current POC RDTs detect both anti-DENV IgMs and IgGs as well as the NS1 antigen. This has the potential to change the current situation in resource-limited areas and improve dengue clinical management.",

Inoculation of ZIKV in the brain of mouse embryos triggers an endoplasmic reticulum stress which perturbs the physiological unfolded protein response (UPR) within apical cortical progenitor cells that control neurogenesis. Sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to apoptosis. Thus, it is likely that, in pregnant women, ZIKV crosses the placental barrier, gets to the brain of the f\u0153tus and crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier, then targets apical cortical progenitor cells, which leads to the blockade of UPR and the arrest of neurogenesis, and, as an obvious consequence, to microcephaly. Microcephaly has not been observed in Africa; it appears to be a specific property of the Brasilian ZIKV strain, and is most likely related to the prM mutation identified by Yuan et al [22].",

A retrospective case-cohort study was undertakern to analyze vaccine safety among dengue seropositive and seronegative trial participants. This work used anti-NS1 results from month 13 of follow-up that were obtained using an anti-NS1 IgG ELISA developed for this purpose. The data confirmed the substantial benefit of CYD-TDV vaccination in those who are dengue seropositive and aged 9 years or older, reducing symptomatic dengue, hospitalized dengue and severe dengue by ~80%. However, in individuals of any age without evidence of prior dengue infection, the vaccine elicited an increased risk of severe dengue, as announced by Sanofi Pasteur in November 2017.

The vaccine should elicit equal protection against the four DENV serotypes, which has been extremely difficult to achieve, in view of competition between strains and/or ADE of some strains: the question has been raised of whether it really is a must to develop tetravalent vaccines? 2. Whether antibodies are associated with protection or risk (ADE) seems to depend on titer, homotypy versus heterotypy, etc. How can that be understood and controlled? 3. Why does severity of the disease, especially that of the post-vaccination adverse events, vary with age? And 4. What is the feasibility and what will be the cost of a necessary pre-vaccination screening?",

As outlined by Dr Anna Durbin (John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) many hurdles still remain before licensure of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine can occur. The transmission of ZIKV has declined so much that it will be difficult to perform a Phase 3 efficacy study.

An active laboratory syndromic surveillance system, such as was developed in the past by WHO for influenza or for poliomyelitis, is badly needed. It is hoped that such a system will be set up rapidly. But we also need more effective mosquito control tools to use in conjunction with vaccines, timely access to clinical serices and appropriate care.
