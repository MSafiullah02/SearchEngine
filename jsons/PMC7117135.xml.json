IBV is an enveloped virus, with single-stranded, positive sense, 5\u2032 capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated RNA genome that is approximately 27 Kb (Boursnell et al., 1987). The 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and four accessory proteins. Genetic diversity in IBV is the result of recombination events and/or mutation, including substitutions, deletions and insertions that occur in the genome. The S1 subunit of the spike protein is particularly variable especially during viral replication. The 5\u2032 end of the genome encodes the replication genes, which are translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed into 15 non-structural proteins (nsp) via proteolytic cleavage (Thiel et al., 2003). For IBV, as for other coronaviruses, the recombination events are thought to result from a unique template switching copy choice mechanism during RNA replication, while the high mutation rates are attributed to the minimal proof reading capabilities of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011).",

            "text": "The S1 gene of IBV is highly variable among different viral strains, which results in the diversity of IBV serotypes/genotypes, this is because the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein is responsible for inducing neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies in chickens (Cavanagh, 2007). Since IBV was first described in 1936, many IBV genotypes/serotypes and variants have been identified (Jackwood, 2012). It is believed that only a small proportion of these have become widespread and predominant in countries with significant poultry industries, it is believed that the majority of these strains have either disappeared or become endemic in certain geographical areas (Khataby et al., 2016). In the last few years, one of the most predominant IBV genotypes circulating in the chicken flocks worldwide is thought to be the LX4 strain (also known as QX-like) (Liu and Kong, 2004, de Wit et al., 2011, Jackwood, 2012). The LX4 genotype is thought to have originated in the mid-1990s in China (Liu and Kong, 2004). Subsequently, it has been shown to be the predominant genotype circulating in chicken flocks in China (Han et al., 2011). Recently, the prevalence of this genotype has been reported in many European and Asian countries (de Wit et al., 2011, Jackwood, 2012, Promkuntod, 2016). LX4 genotype is becoming one of the most important genotypes of IBV resulting in major economic problems in IB-vaccinated flocks in many countries of the world (de Wit et al., 2011). It appears that this genotype is still able to spread rapidly among susceptible flocks in other countries of the world.",

All the viruses were isolated from the chicken flocks suspected to be infected by IB. Information about the regions, years and the organs from which the isolates were obtained are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Viruses were isolated by inoculating and blind passaging in the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, China) until characteristic IBV lesions were observed (Liu and Kong, 2004). Each of the virus stocks was prepared by propagating in 9-day-old SPF chicken eggs, as described previously (Sun et al., 2011). After 48 h incubation, the eggs were chilled for 12\u201318 h at 4 \u00b0C and the allantoic fluid collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until RNA extraction for genome sequencing.",

So we analyzed the genetic diversities by constructing the phylogeny first using the sequences from the N gene to the 3\u2032 UTR. In the neighbor-joining tree, all the viruses clustered separately into seven groups (Groups I to VII) (Fig. 4\n). Of the 110 viruses, 59 were clustered together in Group I which included the viruses isolated between 2007 and 2015. Thirty-four viruses formed Group II which mainly included the viruses isolated between 2005 and 2015. Viruses in Groups III to VII showed higher diversities and some viruses showed close genetic relationship with 4/91 or H120 strains, indicating possible recombination events during the origin of these viruses.",

Strains 4/91 and ck/CH/LHLJ/130822 were selected as potential parental viruses of ck/CH/LHLJ/130744 for SimPlot analysis because they were closely related ck/CH/LHLJ/130744 between the 5\u2032 UTR and the M gene (Fig. 3) and the N gene and the 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. 4), respectively. SimPlot analysis confirmed the aforementioned results, and it clearly showed that ck/CH/LHLJ/130744 arose from a homologous RNA recombination event from a template switch (Fig. 5\nA). A crossover point (nt 26144\u201326161) was found located at the 5\u2032 end of the N gene (Fig. 5B) in strain ck/CH/LHLJ/130744. Similarly, strains H120 and ck/CH/LHLJ/130822 were selected as potential parental viruses of ck/CH/LJL/140734 for SimPlot analysis. It was also shown that ck/CH/LJL/140734 arose from a homologous RNA recombination event (Fig. 5C) and a crossover point (nt 26682\u201326721) was found to be located at the 3\u2032 end of the N gene of strain ck/CH/LHLJ/130744 (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that recombination events might account for the genetic diversities at the 3\u2032 end of the genomes of the viruses in Groups IV and VI.",

            "text": "The complete genomes of 110 LX4 genotype IBV strains were analyzed and compared to each other and to that of three reference types including Beaudette, H120 and M41 as Massachusetts type, 4/91 as a 793/B type and ck/CH/LDL/97I as ck/CH/LDL/97I type. The latter is another very important genotype that first emerged in China and spread to other regions of the world (Ababneh et al., 2012, Marandino et al., 2015). This comparison revealed that most of the viruses (108 out of 110) had a previously known genomic organization (5\u2032-UTR-Gene 1 (ORF1a, 1b)-S-Gene 3 (3a\u20133c)-M-Gene 5 (5a and 5b)-N-UTR-3\u2032), although various lengths of genomes have been found which may be the result of insertions/deletions. Interestingly, different genomic organizations were found in two of the IBV strains, ck/CH/LLN/98I and ck/CH/LJL/08-1, respectively. The 3a gene of ck/CH/LLN/98I was previously found to be absent because of a nucleotide change at the start codon in the 3a gene (Liu et al., 2008b). We sequenced the complete genome in this study and confirmed the previous result. An identical genomic organization lacking the 3a gene was also observed in another IBV strain, ck/CH/LHLJ/111043 (Xu et al., 2016). In this study, we found another novel IBV strain, ck/CH/LJL/08-1, lacked the 5b gene which was also the result of a nucleotide change at the start codon. Novel IBV strains which lacked either all or most of the genes coding for accessory proteins at the 3\u2032 end of the genome have been also isolated in Australia (Mardani et al., 2008). These novel IBVs grew at a slower rate and reached lower titers in vitro and in vivo and were markedly less immunogenic in chicks. Further, although the novel IBVs induced histopathological lesions in the tracheas of infected chicks that were comparable to those induced by classical strains, they did not induce lesions in the kidneys (Mardani et al., 2008). However, the nucleotide sequences of all the essential genes of the novel IBV strains that lacked the accessory genes differed significantly from those of their counterpart IBV strains with a full accessory gene complement, suggesting that these sequences were not derived by mutation or recombination with the more commonly isolated classical strain. In contrast, lack of 5b in ck/CH/LJL/08-1 was the result of a nucleotide change, and therefore had a very similar backbone and high nucleotide sequence similarity to most of the classical IBV strains. It has been demonstrated that Gene 5 (including 5a and 5b) of IBV is not essential for replication using the reverse genetics system in the non-pathogenic strain Beaudette (Casais et al., 2005). Recently, it has been suggested that IBV accessory protein 5b is a functional equivalent of nsp1 of Alpha- and Beta coronavirus and is indispensable for limiting interferon production by inducing a host shutoff which plays an important role in antagonizing the host's innate immune response, thereby indicating that 5b may be an important virulence factor of IBV (Kint et al., 2016). It is not possible to determine if the 5a gene was ever present in strain ck/CH/LJL/08-1 or whether it was deleted as a result of a mutation during their circulation in commercial poultry. The biological characterization, including growth properties, virulence and immunogenicity, of strain ck/CH/LJL/08-1 requires further investigation.",

            "text": "In the mid-1990s, a disease characterized by \u201cproventriculitis\u201d emerged and spread in chicken flocks in China, especially in commercial broilers. In most cases, IBV could be isolated from the proventriculus of the diseased chickens; hence, many researchers in China suggested that a novel pathotype of IBV was the etiological cause of the disease although infection of both SPF and commercial chickens with the IBVs isolated from the proventriculus had not resulted in similar disease progression as observed in field conditions. QXIBV was isolated in 1997 and was among the strains considered to be an etiology causing proventriculitis (YuDong et al., 1998). However, it was not recognized as a novel genotype of IBV at that time. During the dynamic surveillance of IBVs in China, we found that QX-like IBVs were prevalent in many regions in China and they represented a new genotype (LX4 strain as representative) which were nephropathogenic (Liu and Kong, 2004, Liu et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2008a, Liu et al., 2009). Subsequently, this genotype of IBV has spread in chicken flocks in many parts of the world (de Wit et al., 2011, Jackwood, 2012, Promkuntod, 2016). In this retrospective study, we looked at ck/CH/LHLJ/95I isolated in 1995 in China and, to our knowledge, this is the first isolate of the LX4 genotype. The strains of the genotype appeared in different locations in China in the 10 following years, e.g. ck/CH/LHLJ/95I in Heilongjiang in 1995, QXIBV in Shandong in 1996 (YuDong et al., 1998), ck/CH/LLN/98I in Liaoning in 1998, LX4 in Xinjiang in 1999 and ck/CH/LSHH/03II in Shanghai in 2003. It could be argued that either there were more independent introductions of the genotype from an as-yet-unidentified source into commercial poultry at regions geographically distinct from China or the introduction of a single variant occurred at a particular time. It is difficult to answer this question by analysis of only the S gene although generally, the S gene of LX4 genotypes isolated before 2006 are genetically different from those of strains isolated after 2006. Phylogenetic and SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequences of the 110 LX4 genotypes suggested that IBV strains isolated before 2006 were genetically different not only at the S gene but at other part(s) of genome as well. These differences occurred between isolates from similar time periods and from those isolated later, possibly indicating that there were independent introductions of the LX4 genotype into commercial poultry in various regions of China and that these viruses evolved in parallel. The topology of some regions in the genomes of most of the IBV strains isolated before 2006 were clearly different from each other and from those IBVs isolated after 2006 (Fig. 3). Most of these regions have no obvious sequence similarity to their counterparts in other IBV or other coronaviruses (data not shown), indicating that the origin of these strains was not mutation, but might be from recombination events between strains which have not yet been determined, similar to that of Turkey coronavirus (Jackwood et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Interestingly, nearly all the strains of the LX4 genotype isolated after 2006 had similar topology as assessed by phylogenetic and SimPlot analysis which was different from those of most viruses isolated before 2006. Only few strains isolated after 2006 showed diversity at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. Those variations were the result of a recombination event with the vaccine strains which were commonly used in China. Comparatively, two strains (ck/CH/LXJ/02I and ck/CH/LJL/05I) isolated before 2006 showed similar topology to those of strains isolated after 2006 by SimPlot analysis, suggesting that strains isolated after 2006 might be derivatives of these strains after evolution. The disappearance after 2006 of most of the LX4 genotype with various topologies in commercial poultry is unexpected. In most cases, IBV variants persist only transiently, particularly if they are targeted by vaccination (Mardani et al., 2008, de Wit et al., 2011). This may be the case for some of our strains and not for others, such as LD3 and LH1, which were isolated in Heilongjiang and Shandong provinces in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and ck/CH/LHLJ/95I and LX4, which were isolated in Heilongjiang and Xinjiang provinces in 1995 and 1999, respectively. No novel vaccines were introduced into the commercial poultry industry in China in the mid-2000s. Hence, as-yet-unknown factor(s) contributing to the disappearance of some of the virus strains identified here could have been a result of their reduced capacity for replication in chickens. For example, mutations in these strains resulted in the attenuation of these viruses which meant they could not compete with \u201cfitter\u201d viruses (Mardani et al., 2008). In contrast, the LX4 genotype viruses isolated after 2006 may be fitter for replication in chickens and consequently adapted in poultry.",

Most of these viruses disappeared because they were not \u201cfit\u201d to adapt in chickens and lost the competition to others. Finally, those of the \u201cfit\u201d viruses were still evolving and have become widespread and predominant in commercial poultry in China after 2006. In addition, few of these viruses experienced recombination with those of the vaccine strains at the 3\u2032 end of the genome.",
