The Ebola virus infected 318 cases and caused 280 deaths.1 Fever and bleeding were the major symptoms observed at that time; therefore, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) was initially termed Ebola hemorrhagic fever. To date, there have been 33 sporadic outbreaks worldwide, including 23 human-to-human transmission epidemics, three laboratory-induced outbreaks, and seven animal-to-human transmission outbreaks.2 The Ebola virus is spread easily by close personal contact and by the use of contaminated needles and syringes in hospitals and clinics.2, 3 The current epidemic began in Guinea in December 20134 and spread rapidly to surrounding countries in West Africa (Sierra Leone and Liberia). On August 8, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).5 By March 25, 2015, 24 907 probable and 10 326 confirmed cases had been reported in West Africa. Sierra Leone was the most affected country, with 11 841 confirmed cases and 3747 deaths.6\n",

In 2014, the United Nations Development Program declared the Human Development Index in Sierra Leone to be 0.374, ranking it 183rd in the world, and gave life expectancy as around 45.6 years.7 During the outbreak, Ebola infection spread rapidly in Sierra Leone, particularly in the capital, Freetown. By March 25, 2015, there were 3382 confirmed cases of EVD in Freetown, comprising 39.65% of cases in the whole country.8 In response to the EVD outbreak, the Sierra Leone government established an emergency response system via the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) and the National Ebola Response Centre (NERC). The latter is responsible for the coordination and management of medical treatment for EVD patients among 29 Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), Ebola holding centers (EHCs), and Community Care Centers (CCCs); these have been run by medical teams from the USA, UK, France, Australia, South Korea, China, and Cuba.9 The Sierra Leone \u2013 China Friendship Hospital (Jui Government Hospital), built by the Chinese government, is a well-equipped hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. A Chinese medical team comprising 123 medical staff started working in this hospital on September 15, 2014.",

            "text": "Since the start of this EVD outbreak in the early days of 2014, the fatality rate has been around 70.8%.13 Of the 288 confirmed EVD patients in this study, 134 patients had a known outcome and the case fatality rate was 73%. Thus, the findings indicate that these EVD patients had a higher mortality. There are many explanations for this observation. First, antiviral drugs specific to Ebola virus infection are not available. Second, Ansumana et al. documented a clinical experience wherein conventional intravenous fluids and empirical treatment using antibiotics or/and antimalarial drugs could efficiently reduce the mortality rate to 23.4%,14 suggesting that supportive treatment for EVD patients as early as possible, including sufficient rehydration and electrolyte balance, plays a critical role in reducing patient mortality. However, a shortage of medical equipment for handling high-risk blood samples made it difficult to identify the severe cases and give them supportive treatment early enough to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including hypokalemia,15 which is frequent in EVD cases. Third, during the early days of Ebola virus infection, medical staff were presented with non-specific symptoms in EVD patients, and a higher infection rate occurred among the medical staff. In addition, intravenous fluids and blood sampling may lead to needle stick injuries, which increases the risk of Ebola virus transmission for medical staff. All these reasons led to a high rate of EVD incidence in medical staff. For example, nearly 200 doctors and nurses died from the Ebola virus infection in Sierra Leone between May 23 and October 31, 2014,16 which resulted in tension and fear of the disease not only in the general population, but also among the medical staff. This is one of the reasons for the decrease in number of volunteers.17 Fourth, under the hot and humid climate in Sierra Leone, medical staff wearing PPE can only work continuously for 1\u20131.5 h because of sweat-induced dehydration and the loss of the protection role of the PPE. This working time limitation meant that more medical staff were needed to take care of the patients; however, no further medical staff were available in the clinical setting, which increased the workload for existing medical staff. From October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the study hospital was an EHC and was then designated as an ETC; however, no difference in mortality rates was observed between the EHC and ETC periods. Thus, comprehensive clinical therapeutic strategies are urgently required.",

Furthermore, it was found that the mortality of EVD patients was positively associated with patient age in the 134 EVD patients with a known outcome. Interestingly, the plasma viral load was closely associated with the survival time in all 288 confirmed EVD patients. Thus, the findings of the present study, in combination with previous reports from this study group,22, 23, 24 indicate that older patients and those with high viral loads exhibited a higher fatality rate and shorter survival time, which is in concordance with the findings of Schieffelin et al.20 and Bah et al.21\n",

When the probable patients were confirmed as suffering from EVD, the majority were transferred rapidly to other ETCs. As a result, clinical follow-up data for most of the confirmed cases who were admitted to other ETCs were not available. (2) Laboratory test data were not available for all probable and confirmed cases throughout the EHC period and during the early days of the approved ETC because the conditions for routine blood testing were not good enough to protect the testing personnel from viral infection. Thus, there was a tendency to be more conservative in not conducting laboratory tests on blood samples and intravenous fluids from the patients. (3) In addition, during the period as an EHC, the lack of staff experienced in the disease, communication problems between patients and the medical staff (lack of English or lower educational level, such that some patients did not fully understand the questions asked by doctors), the lower proportion of intravenous rehydration, and the lack of laboratory tests (viral loads were available for all of the patients) further contributed to the incomplete medical records.",

Luckily, none of the Chinese medical team staff were infected with the virus during their clinical duties. This could be explained as follows: first, precise specifications and protocols were formulated and strictly enforced during the clinical duty of all of the medical staff to prevent virus infection. Second, the Chinese medical team staff were from the Beijing 302 Hospital, the leading and largest hospital specific for infectious diseases in China; staff at this hospital successfully managed patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the SARS epidemics in 2003, those with A/H1N1 influenza in 2009, and patients from other epidemics. Based on this experience and expertise, we followed not only the regulations and protocols suggested by the WHO, but also proposed a series of other protocols to prevent Ebola virus infection during clinical duties. In particular, we put forward some important concepts including \u201cTaking off PPE is more important than wearing it in the clinic\u201d and \u201ctake off the PPE in different zones, according to the rules of order\u201d.
