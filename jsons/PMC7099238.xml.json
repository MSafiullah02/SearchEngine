It cannot be stressed enough that even bacterial URTIs have a high rate of spontaneous resolution. This has two important implications: antibacterials will help only a small proportion of patients, even when the infection is known to be bacterial, and levels of resistance must be very high before there will be a noticeable effect on outcomes.[7] This explains the apparently paradoxical recommendations by many authorities that the antibacterial of choice \u2212 when required \u2212 is a narrow spectrum drug, even if resistant bacteria are known to be common.",

However, the combination of \u2018routine\u2019 antibacterial prescribing and belief that the patient expects to be prescribed an antibacterial has created a positive feedback loop whereby the prescriber may feel reluctant to discuss not using antibacterials with many patients.

The rationale is that only a small proportion of patients benefit, that resistance in the main bacterial pathogen, S. pneumoniae, is mostly low level and the pathogen will respond to amoxicillin, and that coverage is superior to that of cefaclor, roxithromycin and cotrimoxazole. In the patients who is allergic to penicillin, choices are more restricted. Second and third generation oral cephalosporins, such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, ceftibuten, cefdinir, cefprozil and loracarbef can be used, although all have less activity against strains of S. pneumoniae with reduced penicillin susceptibility than amoxicillin when pharmacodynamic factors are taken into account.[35] Intramuscular ceftriaxone can also be used. Cephalosporins should be avoided if there is a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins. The rates of resistance to cotrimoxazole (>30%) are now too high in most countries for this agent to be recommended. Newer macrolides such as roxithromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin can be used, but their activity against H. influenzae is limited, and rates of resistance in S. pneumoniae range from 5 to 20% or more.",

            "text": "We have entered a new era in the management of upper respiratory tract infections: it is the era of minimal antibacterial prescribing. The general practitioner must take a leading role in winding back the high community expectation of a \u2018pill for every ill\u2019 when that pill is an antibacterial. Even though we do not yet have the bedside tests to distinguish with certainty that patients might benefit from antibacterials at the time of consultation, there are now simple algorithms and lists for providing confidence. There is also a good deal of educational material to assist patients and parents in understanding that URTIs are largely self-resolving and in recognising the downsides of inappropriate antibacterial use. Every opportunity should be taken to re-educate the public about the minor role of antibacterials in URTI.",
