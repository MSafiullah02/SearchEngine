Remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton at the microbial interface promotes pathogen survival and dispersal through a variety of mechanisms. These include intracellular motility of Listeria monocytogenes and escape of autophagic recognition (Tilney et al., 1990), adhesion of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli to the intestinal epithelium (Shaner, Sanger, & Sanger, 2005), and nuclear entry and nonreplicative spread of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (Ohkawa, Volkman, & Welch, 2010).",

Replication of VACV results in the formation of wrapped viruses (WV) at the early endosome/trans\u2010Golgi network, which are transported to the cell periphery via microtubules in a kinesin\u20101\u2010dependent manner (Hollinshead, Hollinshead, Rodger, Van Eijl, Law, Hollinshead, Vaux, & Smith, 2001; Rietdorf, Ploubidou, Reckmann, Holmstrom, Frischknecht, Zettl, \u2026 Way, 2001; Ward, 2004; Ward and Moss, 2001). Here, they fuse with the plasma membrane in an exocytic event leaving an extracellular WV that remains tightly associated with the cell surface. The nucleation of actin in the cytoplasm beneath WV results in comet\u2010like structures of F\u2010actin (also referred to as actin tails) that propel virus particles across the surface of the infected cell (Cudmore, Cossart, Griffiths, & Way, 1995; Frischknecht, Moreau, Rottger, Gonfloni, Reckmann, Superti\u2010Furga, & Way, 1999b; Moreau, Frischknecht, Reckmann, Vincentelli, Rabut, Stewart, & Way, 2000; Wolffe, Weisberg, & Moss, 1998). Infected cells typically exhibit virus\u2010tipped membrane protrusions that are rich in F\u2010actin.",

It is likely that actin\u2010based motility contributes to virus spread via a variety of mechanisms. For example, the repulsion of superinfecting virions allows nonreplicative transmission across early stage\u2010infected cells, thereby increasing the overall rate of cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread (Doceul, Hollinshead, van der Linden, & Smith, 2010). It has also been observed that when VACV\u2010induced actin nucleation is abrogated, WV remain trapped at the cell surface in pits (Horsington, Lynn, Turnbull, Cheng, Braet, Diefenbach, \u2026 Newsome, 2013), indicating that actin nucleation provides a force necessary to resolve exocytosis of virus particles.",

            "text": "Actin nucleation is instigated by the VACV type Ib transmembrane protein A36 that resides in the outer membrane of WV. Following fusion of this outer WV membrane with the plasma membrane, A36 becomes phosphorylated at Tyr112 and Tyr132 by the action of Src\u2010 and Abl\u2010family tyrosine kinases (Frischknecht, Cudmore, Moreau, Reckmann, Rottger, & Way, 1999a; Newsome, Scaplehorn, & Way, 2004; Newsome, Weisswange, Frischknecht, & Way, 2006; Reeves, Bommarius, Lebeis, McNulty, Christensen, Swimm, \u2026 Kalman, 2005). Phosphorylation of A36 leads to the recruitment of a host of cellular proteins, the core cascade comprising of Nck, WIP/WIRE and N\u2010WASP, which act to stabilize and activate the Arp2/3 complex at the cytoplasmic surface of EV (Moreau et al., 2000; Snapper, Takeshima, Anton, Liu, Thomas, Nguyen, \u2026 Alt, 2001). Optimal virus\u2010induced actin nucleation also utilizes other host factors such as Grb2, FHOD1, casein kinase 2, clathrin, the clathrin adaptor AP2, and is accompanied by activation of the small Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 (Alvarez and Agaisse, 2013; Alvarez and Agaisse, 2014; Humphries, Dodding, Barry, Collinson, Durkin, & Way, 2012; Scaplehorn, Holmstrom, Moreau, Frischknecht, Reckmann, & Way, 2002). The critical signal output that results from A36 tyrosine phosphorylation is actin nucleation, and drug inhibition of actin dynamics during viral infection phenocopies, to a large extent, the effects of genetic ablation of A36 or substitution of the Tyr112 and Tyr132 to phenylalanines (VACV\u2010A36YdF) (Horsington et al., 2013).",

Despite their surprisingly similar sequence homologies [only differing by four amino acids; (Vandekerckhove and Weber, 1978a)], recent reports have revealed that \u03b2\u2010 and \u03b3\u2010CYA have different functions and display distinct subcellular localization patterns (Artman, Dormoy\u2010Raclet, von Roretz, & Gallouzi, 2014; Dugina, Zwaenepoel, Gabbiani, Clement, & Chaponnier, 2009; Joseph, Srivastava, & Pfister, 2014; Pasquier, Tuset, Sinnappan, Carnell, Macmillan, & Kavallaris, 2015). \u03b2\u2010actin is predominantly found in basal areas of the cell, cell\u2010cell contacts and stress fibres, while \u03b3\u2010CYA is more apically abundant, and concentrated at peripheral structures such as lamellipodia and the leading edge of motile cells (Chaponnier and Gabbiani, 2004; Dugina et al., 2009]. Differential localization may contribute to the functional diversity of these isoforms, as \u03b3\u2010CYA has been shown to be specifically required for directional cell migration, while \u03b2\u2010CYA contributes to cell attachment and microparticle formation (Latham, Chaponnier, Dugina, Couraud, Grau, & Combes, 2013). The aim of this study was to determine if there are isoform\u2010specific functions of \u03b2\u2010 and \u03b3\u2010CYA during the well\u2010characterized phenomenon of VACV\u2010induced actin nucleation.",

We therefore examined z\u2010sections of infected cells to determine if the preference of actin isoforms along the apical\u2010basal axis was reflected in their localization to actin comets on the apical or basal membrane. A z\u2010stack of images of infected cells (Figure 1c) with VACV\u2010induced actin comets (Figure 1d) was taken via confocal microscopy. These data led us to conclude that VACV\u2010associated actin comets are composed of both CYA isoforms irrespective of their basal or apical localization.",

To this end, we established knockdown of \u03b2\u2010CYA and \u03b3\u2010CYA in HeLa, GBM (glioblastoma) and hCMEC/D3 cell lines. Treatment of HeLa, GBM and hCMEC/D3 cells resulted in isoform\u2010specific knockdown when compared to the scrambled siRNA condition (Figure 2a). Densitometry analysis showed that \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown caused a significant reduction of \u03b2\u2010CYA to about 31, 8, and 44% compared with levels in the scrambled siRNA control in HeLa, GBM, and hCMEC/D3 cells, respectively (p < .05, n \u2265 2; Figure 2b). \u03b3\u2010CYA siRNA treatment produced a comparatively less efficient knockdown of \u03b3\u2010CYA to about 52, 35, and 55% in HeLa, GBM, and hCMEC/D3 cells, respectively (p < .05, n \u2265 2; Figure 2b). Interestingly, knockdown of \u03b2\u2010CYA led to a corresponding significant increase in \u03b3\u2010CYA in HeLa and GBM cell types. This suggests that under knockdown conditions, cells overexpress one isoform to compensate for loss of the other. This has not been observed for CYA isoforms in other studies, either using the same cocktail of isoform\u2010specific siRNA (Dugina et al., 2009) or using only one of those sequences (Pasquier et al., 2015). This could be due to their use of different cell types, varying doses of siRNA or incubation times, and/or the use of only a single CYA\u2010specific siRNA in one of the studies.",

We compared the length of \u03b2\u2010CYA staining to VACV\u2010comet length, which revealed an average ratio of 0.68 \u00b1 0.14 (under \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown) and 0.81 \u00b1 0.12 (scrambled control).

Infected cells were picked at random (by their characteristic peri\u2010nuclear virus factories) and of those, cells with 10 or more actin comets were counted. Treatment of cells with siRNA targeting \u03b2\u2010CYA resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of infected cells containing at least 10 actin comets (Figure 4a). There was no significant difference seen in the \u03b3\u2010CYA\u2010depleted and scrambled siRNA\u2010treated cells. In addition to a reduction in the number of actin comets under \u03b2\u2010CYA depletion, we also recorded a reduction in their length (Figure 4b), which is related to the stability of actin comets and EV release (Horsington et al., 2013; Weisswange, Newsome, Schleich, & Way, 2009). VACV\u2010WR was used to infect hCMEC/D3 or HeLa cells treated with siRNA specific for either \u03b2\u2010CYA or \u03b3\u2010CYA, which were then fixed 8 hpi. In both cell types examined, VACV\u2010induced actin comets produced in \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown cells were significantly shorter compared to those produced in the \u03b3\u2010CYA knockdown or scrambled siRNA\u2010treated cells. There was no significant difference in comet length between the \u03b3\u2010CYA knockdown and scrambled siRNA\u2010treated cells. Despite the decrease in comet length observed under conditions of \u03b2\u2010CYA depletion, live\u2010cell imaging of infected cells labelled with Lifeact\u2010GFP revealed no significant difference in the speed of virus motility (Figure 4c). Surprisingly, knockdown of \u03b3\u2010CYA elicited a two\u2010fold increase in virus motility (0.17 \u03bcm/s compared with 0.8 \u03bcm/s). In summary, we observed that actin comets produced under \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown are shorter although their speeds remain the same relative to the controls. There was no significant difference in length of actin comets produced by \u03b3\u2010CYA knockdown and scrambled siRNA\u2010treated HeLa cells. This implies that while \u03b2\u2010CYA is necessary for the initiation of VACV comets, the ratio of \u03b2\u2010CYA to \u03b3\u2010CYA in a cell may determine the speed of VACV motility, whereby the presence of \u03b3\u2010CYA in the actin comet has a moderating effect on virus speed.",

HeLa cells under either CYA knockdown were infected with either the vaccinia reference strain VACV\u2010WR, or the mutant strain VACV\u2010A36YdF. VACV\u2010A36YdF contains point mutations of the two tyrosine residues in A36R involved in recruiting actin polymerisation machinery, rendering A36 incapable of being tyrosine phosphorylated. The mutant virus is therefore unable to induce actin comets (Rietdorf et al., 2001) and a subsequent reduction in release of extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) from the cell is observed (Horsington et al., 2013). Supernatants from infected cells were collected and plaque assays were performed to determine the infectious EEV titre of each condition (Figure 5a). In cells infected by VACV\u2010WR, EEV release into the supernatant (measured in plaque forming units or pfu/mL) was significantly reduced under \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown. These results are consistent with our previous observations that disrupting actin\u2010based motility leads to a corresponding reduction in EEV release. Cells infected by VACV\u2010A36YdF showed greatly reduced EEV release when compared with VACV\u2010WR as has been previously reported (Horsington et al., 2013). However, no difference in EEV release of VACV\u2010A36YdF was observed under either CYA knockdown condition. All phenotypes associated with actin\u2010based motility are ablated in VACV\u2010A36YdF, and \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown does not exacerbate defects in EEV release in a VACV\u2010A36YdF. This suggests that \u03b2\u2010CYA also disrupts EEV release through actin\u2010based motility rather than other WV protein interactions known to affect EEV release (Smith, Vanderplasschen, & Law, 2002).",

We visualized N\u2010WASP and Src in VACV\u2010infected cells treated for CYA siRNA knockdown (Figure 5b,c). Depletion of \u03b2\u2010CYA or \u03b3\u2010CYA did not lead to overt changes in the recruitment of Src or N\u2010WASP to virus particles, suggesting that the phenotypes we have observed in virus motility are downstream of these critical signalling molecules.",

GBM cells (selected over HeLa due to their amenability to forming monolayers) were subjected to either CYA knockdown and allowed to near confluence, at which point a plaque assay was conducted with VACV\u2010WR. Three days post infection, plaque assays were fixed and the diameter of plaques was measured (Figure 5e). Confounding expectations, plaques produced by VACV\u2010WR treated with \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown were significantly larger than those compared to plaques produced in cells under \u03b3\u2010CYA knockdown or treated with scrambled siRNA. These results indicate that knockdown of \u03b2\u2010CYA produces a complex phenotype and that other mechanisms may compensate for the expected reduction in plaque size elicited by the reduction in actin\u2010based motility.",

N\u2010WASP is an actin nucleation\u2010promoting factor that is recruited to the site of actin comet formation during VACV egress (Frischknecht et al., 1999b; Moreau et al., 2000). The VCA domain of N\u2010WASP recruits the Arp2/3 complex and two actin monomers, branching off from an existing actin filament. If the VCA domain were to have a preference for the \u03b2\u2010CYA isoform, that would explain the dependence on \u03b2\u2010CYA for actin\u2010based virus transport. Two bacterial expression plasmids were constructed: one expressing a glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST)\u2010tagged VCA domain and another expressing a GST\u2010tagged VCA domain containing two arginine\u2010alanine substitutions in its actin\u2010binding region, VCA\u2010R410A/R438A (called VCA\u2010RA/RA), which effectively abrogate actin binding (Co, Wong, Gierke, Chang, & Taunton, 2007). GST\u2010tagged VCA proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified and used to enrich for actin by passing cell lysates over the bound, immobilized protein and probing for actin isoforms. As expected, actin bound to GST\u2010VCA and did not bind to the GST\u2010VCA RA/RA (Figure 6a). The next step was to examine whether the actin that bound to the VCA domain was specifically one CYA isoform. Both anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010CYA and anti\u2010\u03b3\u2010CYA antibodies bound to an immunoblot of cell lysates passed over GST\u2010VCA protein (Figure 6b), suggesting that the VCA domain does not specifically bind to one CYA over the other.",

For example, while \u03b2\u2010CYA localises to stress fibres and cell\u2010cell contacts, \u03b3\u2010CYA is abundant in lamellipodial structures and is important for cell motility (Dugina et al., 2009). Studies have identified isoform\u2010specific functions during multiple cellular processes (Artman et al., 2014; Hajkova, Nyman, Lindberg, & Karlsson, 2000; Joseph et al., 2014; Pasquier et al., 2015), as well as distinct requirements in the replication cycle of viruses like coronaviruses (Wang, Fang, Xiao, Chen, Tam, & Liu, 2009) and the classical swine fever virus (He, Ling, Liao, Li, Han, Zhao, \u2026 Qiu, 2014). While these reports revealed a role for \u03b2\u2010CYA in the early stages of viral infection, from viral gene expression and replication to assembly, our study supports a requirement for \u03b2\u2010CYA in the initiation of actin comets induced by VACV during the late stages of infection.",

As is typical for siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown, the loss of \u03b2\u2010CYA expression was not complete, with a reduction to approximately 20% (on average for both cell types tested) of control levels, which suggests a threshold at which reduced levels no longer supports actin nucleation. Levels of \u03b2\u2010CYA recruited to VACV particles correlated with comet length, even under \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown, and at least some accumulation of \u03b2\u2010CYA was evident at the viral surface in all cases. Indeed due to the variability of knockdown at the cellular level, we could observe cells with low \u03b2\u2010CYA expression that gave rise to few virus\u2010associated comets. These results are consistent with an absolute, albeit dosage\u2010sensitive, requirement for \u03b2\u2010CYA in VACV actin nucleation and actin\u2010based motility. Previous studies have also demonstrated significant morphological and functional changes in various cell types with incomplete knockdown of CYA isoforms, such as taking on a less or a more contractile phenotype, or an increase/decrease in lamellipodial structures, stress fibres, and cell motility (Dugina et al., 2009; Pasquier et al., 2015; Shum, Pasquier, Po'uha, O'Neill, Chaponnier, Gunning, & Kavallaris, 2011).",

This is as expected, as both the generation of intracellular enveloped VACV, as well as their transport to the cell periphery, is independent from release of EEV particles (Horsington et al., 2013; Lynn, Horsington, Ter, Han, Chew, Diefenbach, \u2026 Newsome, 2012; Payne and Kristensson, 1982; Ward and Moss, 2001). The translocation of enveloped virus particles to the cell surface was performed by quantifying B5\u2010positive extracellular virus. \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown resulted in a higher percentage of multinucleated cells compared with scrambled siRNA and \u03b3\u2010CYA knockdown in both infected and uninfected HeLa cells (results not shown). This has also been previously observed in uninfected HaCaT cells (Dugina et al., 2009). This made it challenging to find singular infected cells to quantify the number of virus particles reaching the surface and/or number of actin comets produced per cell. While the depletion of \u03b3\u2010CYA by siRNA can suppress microtubule dynamics in SH\u2010EP cells expressing GFP\u2010labelled tubulin (Po'uha, Honore, Braguer, & Kavallaris, 2013), we did not observe any difference in the number of virus particles either being released or being transported to the cell periphery under \u03b3\u2010CYA depletion. As the major effects observed by Po'uha et al (2013) were a decrease in microtubule shortening rates and a delayed metaphase\u2010anaphase transition, this may have been insufficient to grossly perturb the microtubule\u2010based transport of VACV. Reducing levels of \u03b3\u2010CYA did lead to increased speed of VACV undergoing actin\u2010based transport but this did not lead to additional phenotypes in virus release or cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread. The knockdown of \u03b3\u2010CYA in HeLa cells causes a compensatory increase in the levels of \u03b2\u2010CYA (Figure 2b), which indicates that comets with greater speeds observed in \u03b3\u2010CYA\u2010depleted cells may be caused by a shift in the ratio of CYAs in favor of \u03b2\u2010CYA. This observation is in agreement with the previously shown ability of \u03b2\u2010CYA to polymerize at faster rates than \u03b3\u2010CYA in a reconstituted system (Bergeron, Zhu, Thiem, Friderici, & Rubenstein, 2010).",

Reductions in actin comet length have been observed previously, either due to mutations in the viral A36 envelope protein, or mutations in cellular N\u2010WASP, which abrogates its ability to bind to actin monomers and reduce its stability during actin polymerization (Horsington et al., 2013; Weisswange et al., 2009). As we also observed a significant reduction in the length of actin comets during \u03b2\u2010CYA depletion, we hypothesized that altered binding, such as a preference for \u03b2\u2010CYA by N\u2010WASP, may contribute to the actin nucleation phenotype. To test this model, we expressed GST\u2010tagged fusions of the VCA domain of N\u2010WASP (its actin\u2010binding region of N\u2010WASP; see Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007 for a review), or a mutated version of the domain with abrogated actin\u2010binding ability (VCA\u2010RA/RA; Co et al., 2007). The ability of these tagged proteins to bind to actin was examined, and no preference for either CYA isoform was observed by immunoblot. Additionally, phosphorylation of the N\u2010WASP VCA domain has been shown to enhance actin polymerization activity (Cory, Cramer, Blanchoin, & Ridley, 2003), a post\u2010translational modification that may not be present in bacterially\u2010expressed GST\u2010VCA domains. Nonetheless, our results do not support a specific binding affinity of the WH2 domains of N\u2010WASP for \u03b2\u2010CYA as the underlying mechanism that results in a requirement for this isoform in VACV actin\u2010based motility. A recent genome\u2010wide siRNA screen performed during infection of HeLa cells with the bacterial pathogen Listeria, also known to employ actin\u2010based motility for infection (Lambrechts, Gevaert, Cossart, Vandekerckhove, & Van Troys, 2008), showed that siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of \u03b2\u2010CYA, but not \u03b3\u2010CYA, impaired infection (Kuhbacher et al., 2015). These findings suggest that specificity for actin isoforms for actin nucleation might be at the level of the Arp2/3 complex, rather than with its activator N\u2010WASP.",

An enhancement of directional cell migration during \u03b2\u2010CYA depletion, as well as a reduction in migration during \u03b3\u2010CYA depletion, has also been observed previously (Dugina et al., 2009). This increase in motility during \u03b2\u2010CYA knockdown could also be playing a role in VACV virus\u2010induced cell motility, contributing to an increased plaque size. The VACV protein F11 is also responsible for virus\u2010induced cell migration, through its inhibition of RhoA signalling (Cordeiro, Guerra, Arakawa, Dodding, Esteban, & Way, 2009; Valderrama, Cordeiro, Schleich, Frischknecht, & Way, 2006). This may explain why we have not observed a corresponding reduction in plaque size during \u03b3\u2010CYA knockdown. Interestingly, \u03b2\u2010CYA synthesis has also been associated with Rho signalling (Latham, Yu, Tullio, Adelstein, & Singer, 2001) and the use of a Rho kinase inhibitor can cause the selective disorganization of \u03b2\u2010CYA bundles while leaving \u03b3\u2010CYA undisturbed (Dugina et al., 2009). Clearly there is a strong link between \u03b2\u2010CYA and Rho signalling, such that the depletion of \u03b2\u2010CYA may have a significant effect on Rho and its downstream signalling targets. The use of ROCK inhibitors under conditions of \u03b2\u2010 and \u03b3\u2010CYA knockdown may, in future studies, clarify the complex networks involved in this process. It is evident, however, that cell motility is an important determinant of VACV plaque size.",

            "text": "This work contributes to the emerging paradigm that not all actin isoforms are equivalent. Studies have shown a specific interaction of \u03b2\u2010CYA with viral membrane proteins like the classical swine fever virus E2 protein (He et al., 2014) and the coronavirus M protein (Wang et al., 2009). While we have not observed a physical interaction between a specific actin isoform and a VACV protein, our results indicate that \u03b2\u2010CYA plays a role in the N\u2010WASP\u2010mediated nucleation of actin beneath VACV particles.",

Clearly blocking all actin functions would be highly detrimental to a cell. Our results indicate that specific pathogenic mechanisms can be successfully targeted, even for such a fundamental process as actin nucleation, by inhibiting one isoform of a highly conserved group of proteins. Our data was unable to uncover the precise mechanism by which \u03b2\u2010CYA actin is required during VACV\u2010induced actin nucleation, but they suggest a link between the activity of a particular nucleator, N\u2010WASP, and an actin isoform, \u03b2\u2010CYA. This raises the tantalizing possibility that nucleators may be subject to regulation by isoform availability, which is consistent with the highly localized distributions of \u03b2\u2010CYA and actin\u2010CYA at the subcellular level.",
