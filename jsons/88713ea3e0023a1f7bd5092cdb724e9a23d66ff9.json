            "text": "Iceland is free of the major infectious diseases of horses. However, in 2010 an epidemic of respiratory disease of unknown cause spread through the country's native horse population of 77,000. Microbiological investigations ruled out known viral agents but identified the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) in diseased animals. We sequenced the genomes of 257 isolates of S. zooepidemicus to differentiate epidemic from endemic strains. We found that although multiple endemic clones of S. zooepidemicus were present, one particular clone, sequence type 209 (ST209), was likely to have been responsible for the epidemic. Concurrent with the epidemic, ST209 was also recovered from a human case of septicemia, highlighting the pathogenic potential of this strain. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into one training yard during February 2010 provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses that then transmitted the strain to farms throughout Iceland. This study represents the first time that whole-genome sequencing has been used to investigate an epidemic on a national scale to identify the likely causative agent and the link to an associated zoonotic infection. Our data highlight the importance of national biosecurity to protect vulnerable populations of animals and also demonstrate the potential impact of S. zooepidemicus transmission to other animals, including humans. IMPORTANCE An epidemic of respiratory disease affected almost the entire native Icelandic horse population of 77,000 animals in 2010, resulting in a self-imposed ban on the export of horses and significant economic costs to associated industries. Although the speed of transmission suggested that a viral pathogen was responsible, only the presence of the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus zooepidemicus was consistent with the observed clinical signs. We applied genomic sequencing to differentiate epidemic from endemic strains and to shed light on the rapid transmission of the epidemic strain throughout Iceland. We further highlight the ability of epidemic and endemic strains of S. zooepidemicus to infect other animals, including humans. This study represents the first time that whole-genome sequencing has been used to elucidate an outbreak on a national scale and identify the likely causative agent.",

This isolation of the population has meant that Icelandic horses have remained free from most common contagious diseases of Equidae, including equine influenza, equine rhinopneumonitis, equine viral arteritis, Rhodococcus equi infection, and strangles (Streptococcus equi subsp. equi infection) (1) (2) (3) . As such, the population is extremely vulnerable to these and other infectious agents, and strict biosecurity measures are in place to maintain a high health status.",

Data from 180 (90%) of these premises that responded confirmed that the disease was already widespread throughout Iceland by the first week of April 2010, with affected premises in the south, west, and north of Iceland. These data provided evidence that all horses residing at these premises appeared to be susceptible to the infectious agent, with a morbidity of 100% but low mortality. Dry cough was usually the first clinical sign noted, most often coexisting with symptoms of mucopurulent nasal discharge and mild conjunctivitis, although rectal temperature remained normal in most horses. Laryngoscopy revealed laryngitis and inflammation of the upper trachea. The incubation period was between 2 and 4 weeks and the duration of clinical signs varied from 2 to 10 weeks.",

Three other horses at farm 16 had a history of similar clinical signs 2 to 6 weeks earlier. Network analysis of affected farms identified a single common training yard (yard A) as a primary center of transmission (Fig. 1) . Two horses leaving yard A on 19 February transmitted the disease both to farm 16 and to a stable in the Reykjavik area. All horses (n \u03ed 20) that left yard A in March transmitted the disease to new premises (n \u03ed 18). These new premises each had up to 50 horses stabled and became secondary centers of transmission. However, two horses from yard A which had returned to farm 16 on 4 February were not incubating the disease. Therefore, it is likely that the transmission of the infectious agent to horses at yard A began between 5 and 19 February 2010.",

Clade 4 (ST306) contained 37 isolates obtained from eight horses from the Institute for Experimental Pathology, Icelandic Veterinary Institute at Keldur, Reykjavik, that were sampled over a 50-day period from 13 September to 1 November 2010. Six of these horses had signs of respiratory disease over the sampling period. Clade 3 (ST248) contained 52 isolates obtained from 14 horses and a dog. The horses were resident at 8 different farms, and the isolates were recovered over a 160-day period between 19 May and 25 October 2010. Twelve of the horses had signs of disease, including two with pyrexia. The remaining two horses were both from farm 17, had died with signs of interstitial pneumonia identified postmortem, and were infected with ST248 or both ST248 and ST209 (Table S2 ). Clade 2 (ST246) contained 28 isolates obtained from 14 horses residing at 10 farms over a 162-day period between 6 May and 14 October 2010 and also one human isolate. Two of the horses infected with ST246 had died with evidence of pneumonia or interstitial pneumonia at postmortem examination. All 12 of the remaining horses had clinical signs of disease, including 2 with pyrexia at the time of sampling. Finally, clade 1 (ST209) contained 81 isolates from 45 horses residing at 21 premises across Iceland over a 152-day period between 10 May and 8 October 2010. ST209 was also recovered from a human and a cat.

Following the resolution of the epidemic, we hypothesized that the ST209 strain had become endemic within the Icelandic horse population and that the genetic variation that had accrued since the epidemic could be exploited to estimate the time of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) shared by the Icelandic ST209 population. To determine if the ST209 strain persisted within the Icelandic horse population, we sampled an additional 36 healthy horses 3 years after the epidemic. A total of 175 S. zooepidemicus isolates were recovered. Of these, 20 isolates were identified by quantitative PC (qPCR) as ST209 and had been obtained from four healthy horses stabled at different farms throughout Iceland (Table S2) . WGS of the isolates from each of the individual horses indicated that they were very closely related. However, isolates from the different horses clustered separately, with longer branch lengths relative to the isolates recovered from the epidemic in 2010. We analyzed a subset of our data set, for which the date of isolation was known, with the Bayesian phylogenetics software BEAST (13) . Removal of strains with identical sequences that were recovered from the same animal on the same date produced a data set of 59 ST209 isolates with 434 polymorphic core genome positions (Table S2 ). This data set comprised 4 isolates from 2013, 48 isolates that were recovered during the epidemic in 2010, and 7 non-Icelandic isolates which shared an identical or closely related ST to ST209. BEAST includes a number of relaxed molecular clock models that permit modeling of variations in substitution rates on different branches of the tree, allowing correction for the observed rate variation in our data. Utilizing these models, we found that a strict clock with a skyline population model was the best fit of our data, and the mean substitution rate per core genome site per year was calculated as 2.0 \u03eb 10 \u03ea6 . This substitution rate is similar to core genome rates reported for other streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes (1.1 \u03eb 10 \u03ea6 ) (14) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.6 \u03eb 10 \u03ea6 ) (15), and many other Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (3.3 \u03eb 10 \u03ea6 ) (16) . Interestingly, this rate is faster than that for the closely related host-restricted pathogen Streptococcus equi (5.2 \u03eb 10 \u03ea7 ) (17), with which S. zooepidemicus shares \u03fe97% DNA identity (11) . This difference most likely reflects the unusual lifestyle of S. equi, which can persist within the guttural pouches of recovered horses (17) . The analysis provided a median estimate for the TMRCA of the Icelandic ST209 strains of July 2008 (95% highest posterior density, August 2007 to May 2009) (Fig. 5) .",

ST246 strains were recovered from two fatal cases of pneumonia at farms 21 and 29 in different areas of Iceland, and ST248 strains were recovered from two horses that died from pneumonia at farm 17 (one of which was coinfected with ST209). However, ST246 or ST248 isolates were each recovered from only 14 horses on 8 and 10 farms, respectively. In comparison, ST209 isolates were recovered from 45 horses that were sampled on 21 farms across Iceland. The genetic diversity of ST246 and ST248 strains was significantly higher than that of ST209, suggesting that these other strains were endemic within the Icelandic horse population and were not likely to be responsible for the widespread occurrence of respiratory signs associated with the epidemic in 2010. ST306 strains were only recovered from 8 horses at the Icelandic Veterinary Institute. Even then, the nucleotide diversity of these isolates was significantly higher than that of ST209 isolates. Our data suggest that ST306 had persisted within this closed population of horses for several years and that it was highly unlikely to have caused the epidemic of respiratory disease in 2010. S. zooepidemicus can cause severe disease in humans (6, 7, (18) (19) (20) and other animals (21) (22) (23) , and transmission from animals to humans has been demonstrated (6, 19) . The epidemic ST209 strain was recovered from a cat and from a blood sample from an Icelandic woman who had suffered a miscarriage (E1462/10 and E2609/10, respectively) (Fig. 5) . A closely related strain of S. zooepidemicus ST209, Hum3, was recovered from a psoas abscess in a Finnish man in 2011 (24) , suggesting that ST209 strains of S. zooepidemicus may have increased potential to cross host boundaries to cause zoonotic disease. Several other cases of human infections in Iceland during 2010 may have been caused by the ST209 strain, but unfortunately these isolates were not available for sequencing. The other two isolates of S. zooepidemicus, E2828/10 and E2827/10, that were recovered from humans during the epidemic period were ST246 and ST2, respectively. Both of these STs are representatives of endemic Icelandic strains, highlighting that the prevalence of zoonotic transmission of S. zooepidemicus may be underreported.",

Although the epidemic agent was generally transmitted through the coughing of infected horses, coughing was not observed at yard A before April 2010, most probably due to a relatively long incubation period permitting apparently healthy horses to return to their original premises posttraining. Instead, the most likely route of transmission of the epidemic strain at yard A was a water treadmill, which horses used on a daily basis. The water used in the treadmill contained no disinfectant and was changed on a once-or twice-weekly basis, providing ideal conditions for the transmission of S. zooepidemicus between the visiting horses. The addition of chlorine coupled with regular cleaning and disinfection of water treadmills may minimize or eliminate the transmission of S. zooepidemicus or other infectious agents via this route.",

Our data suggest that the ST306 isolates of S. zooepidemicus likely persisted in the horses at the Icelandic Veterinary Institute, accruing nucleotide diversity over time within this isolated population. Analysis of S. equi isolates recovered from persistently infected animals identified that they had an increased rate of substitution and that isolates from the same animal could accrue substitutions, amplifications, and deletions (17) . Therefore, it is possible that a mixed population of ST209 variants, which could have originated from one or more horses, may have been introduced to Iceland at a date much closer to the start of the 2010 epidemic. However, it is also possible that the proposed transmission of ST209 strains, for example, via the submerged treadmill at yard A, provided conditions that led to a selective sweep of a more diverse population of ST209, with the successful variants establishing the epidemic. In this manner, the introduction of ST209 into Iceland may have predated the calculated TMRCA.",

The import of horses to Iceland has been prohibited since 1882 for biosecurity reasons. Although the import of used riding equipment is also prohibited, it is difficult to control. Therefore, contaminated tack represents a possible industryrelated route of introduction of the ST209 strain into Iceland. The ability of ST209 strains to cross host boundaries provides an alternative import mechanism whereby the infection of a human may have facilitated onward anthroponotic transmission to horses resident in Iceland.

Multiple isolates recovered from the same clinical sample or the same horse sampled over time optimized the isolation of the epidemic strain in the face of concomitant colonization. Six Icelandic isolates recovered from cases of S. zooepidemicus disease in companion animals (two cats and one dog) and in three people that occurred during the epidemic, and Icelandic isolates from seven horses, one dog, and two sheep that predated the 2010 epidemic were included in the analysis. Ten archived Icelandic isolates of S. zooepidemicus from seven horses, two sheep, and a dog were included to provide an insight into the identity of historical isolates of S. zooepidemicus from Iceland. We also included the sequenced genomes of 38 strains of S. zooepidemicus from outside Iceland that were representative of the known species diversity as a whole, as defined by MLST (41) , including the published genome sequences for S. zooepidemicus strains MGCS10565 (10), H70 (11), BHS5 (42), and ATCC 35246 (43) .",

Adapter ligation was followed by overlap extension PCR using the Illumina 3 primer set to introduce specific tag sequences between the sequencing and flow cell binding sites of the Illumina adapter. DNA was quantified by qPCR and sequenced on the Illumina GAII and HiSeq platforms according to the manufacturer's protocols, generating index tag end sequences. For isolates recovered post-2011, DNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA library prep kit, according to the standard protocol.

Illumina reads were mapped onto the relevant reference sequences by using SMALT (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/), with H70 (GenBank accession number FM204884) for the total population and a de novo assembly of clade 1. A minimum 30-fold depth of coverage for more than 92% of the reference genomes was achieved for both reference sequences (Table S2 ). The default mapping parameters recommended for reads were employed but with the minimum score required for mapping increased to 30 to make the mapping more conservative. Candidate SNPs were identified using SAMtools mpileup (44) , with SNPs filtered to remove those at sites with a mapping depth of less than 5 reads and an SNP score below 60. SNPs at sites with heterogeneous mappings were filtered out if the SNP was present in less than 75% of reads at that site (16) . Identification of the core genomes was performed as previously described (16, 45) . Recombination was detected in the genomes by using Gubbins (http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/gubbins/) (46) . Figure S1 summarizes the Gubbins output for clade 1 (ST209) isolates. Phylogenetic trees were constructed separately using RAxML v7.0.4 (47) for all sites in the core genomes containing SNPs, with a general time-reversible (GTR) model with a gamma correction for among-site rate variations (16) . The genetic variation within each of the four clades, with isolates from duplicate horses removed (Table S2) , was summarized using their nucleotide diversity (8) , , calculated using the DendroPy Python library (9) . The variances of the nucleotide diversity estimates were calculated as described in reference 48 and used to compute confidence intervals using a normal distribution approximation. We used the Bayesian software package BEAST (v1.7.4) (49) to investigate the temporal, spatial, and demographic evolution of the ST209 population, with replicate samples removed from the analysis. To estimate the substitution rates and times for divergences of internal nodes on the tree, a GTR model with a gamma correction for among-site rate variation was used. All combinations of strict, relaxed log normal, relaxed exponential, and random clock models and constant, exponential, expansion, logistic, and skyline population models were evaluated. For each, three independent chains were run for 100 million generations, sampling every 10 generations. A maximum clade credibility tree was created from the resulting combined trees created using the treeAnnotator program, also from the BEAST package.",

We also thank the personnel at the Department of Bacteriology at Keldur for their technical assistance. The Icelandic human isolates were obtained from the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Landsp\u00edtali University Hospital, Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. The human isolates from the United Kingdom were provided by Androulla Efstratiou at Public Health England. Bovine isolates were provided by Adrian Whatmore of the Animal and Plant Health Agency. The human isolate from Finland was a kind gift from Sinikka Pelkonen and Tamara Tuuminen of the Finnish Food Safety Authority and University of Helsinki, respectively. We are grateful to Alistair Darby of the University of Liverpool for providing the genome sequence of S. zooepidemicus strain 1175. We also thank the core sequencing and informatics teams at the Sanger Institute for their assistance.S.R.H., J.P., and M.T.G.H. were supported by the Wellcome Trust (grant 098051).",
