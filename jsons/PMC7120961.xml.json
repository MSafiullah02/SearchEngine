This reported prevalence is likely to be substantially underestimated, particularly given the increased recognition of interstitial lung diseases in the pediatric population in recent years, due to: (1) a recently developed classification system for categorizing pediatric interstitial lung disease; (2) increased recognition particularly of the unique interstitial lung diseases which occur in infants; and (3) increased use of thoracoscopic lung biopsy in pediatric patients for definitive diagnosis. Additionally, although the prevalence of any single specific interstitial lung disease is low, the combination of the varied types of interstitial lung diseases in the pediatric population may be sizable as a collective group. A national registry or large prospective multicenter studies focusing on evaluation of the true prevalence of interstitial lung disease in infants and children is currently needed.",

Three major challenges include, first, interstitial lung disease is less common in infants and children compared with adults. Therefore, most clinicians and radiologists are less familiar with considering and recognizing interstitial lung disease in this patient population. Second, the clinical manifestations of interstitial lung disease particularly in infants and the young child are often subtle, highly variable, and typically nonspecific, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles, and hypoxemia. Lastly, there are currently no pathognomonic clinical or laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in pediatric patients. Some of the major uncertainties involving interstitial lung disease in this population include: (1) the paucity of information regarding the natural history of interstitial lung disease in childhood; (2) the lack of understanding of the role of specific host factors in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease; and (3) the absence of information on prognostic indicators in interstitial lung disease in childhood, and more particularly in infants. Due to the above stated challenges and uncertainties, evaluation and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in childhood and particularly in infants has been markedly limited in the past.",

            "text": "Two main factors led to the development of a new classification for new childhood interstitial lung \u00addisease (ChILD). First, there has been substantial confusion and difficulty associated with the \u00addescription and classification of specific interstitial lung \u00addiseases in infants and young children with multiple terms used for similar abnormalities and sometimes the same term used for differing conditions; and there has been a tendency to attempt to fit these pediatric disorders into the diagnostic schema used for adults. As the adult ILD classification became more refined and as more knowledge was gained about certain forms of infant ILD, it became clear that using the adult classification was both suboptimal and limiting as conditions common in adults are rare or nonexistent in infants and children and recently recognized infant conditions have no place in the adult classification. Second, the adult ILD classification system did not acknowledge the important role of heritable and genetic disorders that have become widely recognized as an important component of ChILD. The recognition of the role of genetic disorders of the surfactant system was pivotal in changing this understanding. And, now genetic underpinnings are being sought for a wider group of ChILD. Classifying ILD in the pediatric patient based on the adult ILD classification system is no longer a viable approach.",

            "text": "Recognition of the substantial differences between pediatric and adult ILD led to the evolution of the current and evolving classification system for ChILD. A European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force addressed this issue in a retrospective review of 185 pediatric cases of chronic interstitial lung disease in immunocompetent patients; most, but not all, had lung biopsy and histologic material which was not reviewed as part of this project; the diagnoses made at initial examination were accepted. The ERS review divided the diagnoses made clinically into four categories based on a proposal by Fan and Langston [6]: (1) Diffuse lung parenchymal disease of unknown association (drug reaction, aspiration, connective tissue disorders, infection, environmental disorders); (2) idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [NSIP]), cellular/fibrotic, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), diffuse alveolar damage/acute interstitial pneumonia (DAD/AIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) to include familial cryptogenic fibrosing \u00adalveolitis, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI); (3) other forms of interstitial pneumonia to include lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Langerhans cell granulomatosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), sarcoidosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, idiopathic/infantile pulmonary hemosiderosis; and (4) congenital disorders (DIP, LIP, lipoid pneumonia, NSIP/UIP, and surfactant deficiencies). Although this concept was an important step toward improved understanding and diagnosis of ChILD, there was clearly a need for further refinement, particularly as diagnostic criteria were not provided for these entities, disorders of immunocompromised children were not addressed, and the requirement for chronicity excluded severe and rapidly progressive conditions. Additionally, adult terminology continued to be used in large part for quite different entities including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), conditions that are common in adults, but vanishingly rare in childhood. This study was a major advance in redirecting thinking about ChILD, and it is important for this reason, but does not truly present a new classification system, nor did it resolve many of the issues leading to diagnostic confusion.",

This new pediatric interstitial lung disease classification system was validated for infants and very young children in a retrospective review of 186 lung biopsies done between 1999 and 2004 [2] with accompanying clinical histories and images from children under age 2 contributed by 11 pediatric institutions in North America. The importance of this new classification system lies in its acknowledgment of the unique nature of ILD in infants and the overlap of other lung disorders seen in infants and young children with the varied spectrum of conditions seen in older children and adults. Based on this new classification system, ChILD is classified into three main groups: (1) disorders of infancy; (2) other categories (not specific to infancy); and (3) unclassifiable. This expandable and flexible system for categorization has gained wide clinical recognition. This chapter uses this classification scheme (Table 8.1) as its organizing principal focusing initially on those disorders seen almost exclusively during infancy and not in older children or adults.\n",

Due to their rapid clinical course of respiratory \u00adfailure, most infants with this type of interstitial lung disease die during the first 2 months of life despite supportive management including advanced ventilation \u00adsupport strategies, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and therapeutic interventions for PHT. Infants with acinar dysplasia, the rarest of these conditions, present at birth and their survival is shortest. While most reported cases are female infants, male infants may be affected as well. Those with CAD typically present within hours of birth and require continuous and often maximal supportive measures for survival with such support they may survive weeks, but cannot be weaned from these measures. Infants with ACD/MPV typically present within the first few days of birth, but a few have a delayed presentation at weeks or sometimes a few months of age. Once they present, their course with respiratory failure and PHT rarely ameliorates and death by 1 month following presentation is the usual outcome.",

In addition, the majority of infants with ACD/MPV have other congenital anomalies most commonly involving the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (including absence of the gallbladder), and/or genitourinary system. A search for the genetic basis of ACD/MPV has resulted in the recent recognition of mutation/microdeletion of the FOXF1 gene in a proportion of ACD/MPV cases and the recognition of familial cases highlights the need for genetic testing and counseling in cases with suspected ACD/MPV. As genetic abnormalities have not been found for acinar dysplasia or CAD, and as all ACD/MPV cases have not yet had a genetic mechanism identified, the definitive diagnosis of these developmental disorders currently rests on pathological analysis of lung tissue from biopsy and/or postmortem specimens.",

For CAD (Fig. 8.2) and ACD/MPV (Fig. 8.3), lung size is typically normal or even large particularly when there has been long-term ventilatory support. Histologically, CAD (Fig. 8.2) suggests growth arrest in the canalicular stage of lung development showing acinar formation with simplified lung structure and sometimes, but not always, reduced capillary density. Histologic changes in ACD/MPV (Fig. 8.3) are less clearly reminiscent of a specific stage in lung development, but there is lobular underdevelopment with variable and sometimes marked alveolar enlargement and reduced capillary density. In addition to the structural changes in the lobule, there are vascular changes including prominent medial hyperplasia of small pulmonary arteries and malposition of pulmonary veins adjacent to arteries and small airways, as well as sometimes prominent regional or diffuse lymphangiectasis.",

A family history of lung disease may be present in such infants and is common in those with SpC mutations. On laboratory examination, PAS-positive material identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be potential clues in the diagnosis of surfactant dysfunction disorders. Genetic analysis is considered the definitive diagnostic test, although lung biopsy is often done for categorization and for prognosis and treatment considerations while awaiting the results of genetic testing. Lung biopsy is also definitive for those without as yet recognized genetic mutation and often guides the workup of those with rare genetic disorders in this category. The current treatment for infants with surfactant dysfunction disorders presenting with interstitial lung disease varies based on the degree of clinical symptoms and the underlying genetic defect. Aggressive chronic ventilation for infants with respiratory failure is currently most often performed for infants with a SpC mutation and lung transplant is the only effective therapeutic option for infants with SpB mutation. Those with ABCA3 mutations have a more varied presentation and course, at least in part depending on the specific mutation involved. In older children with ABCA3, there is a high incidence of pectus excavatum [27]. There are a few cases of SpB and ABCA3 mutations that have been noted anecdotally to respond to hydroxychloroquine therapy.",

These changes typically are described as one of several possible histologic patterns seen in these disorders, including PAP pattern, desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) pattern, CPI pattern, and NSIP pattern, all of which in this setting suggest an underlying surfactant dysfunction mutation. While each of these patterns may be seen with any one of the specific surfactant dysfunction mutations, PAP is uncommon and when seen suggests an SpB abnormality, DIP is more often seen with SpC or ABCA3 abnormalities, and CPI is more characteristic of SpC but may also be seen with ABCA3 mutations. An NSIP pattern is more often seen in older infants and children with SpC or ABCA3 abnormalities. Histologic variants outside these typical definable patterns also occur, but all are marked by the key features of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, an element of proteinosis, and an element of lipid accumulation most often as a few scattered cholesterol clefts. Electron microscopic examination of lung tissue can be helpful as well, as ABCA3 and SpB have specific ultrastructural abnormalities of lamellar bodies in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. ABCA3 has tiny lamellar bodies with a prominent dense inclusion and SpB shows reduced numbers of lamellar bodies with reduced lamellations and sometimes fusion of lamellar and multivesicular bodies.",

Affected infants are usually term and typically present with clinical symptoms of persistent tachypnea, retractions, hypoxemia, and crackles without substantial cough or wheezing by 3 months of age often beginning after an initial period of well-being and sometimes following an uncomplicated viral respiratory infection. Infant pulmonary function test may show evidence of substantial hyperinflation and bronchoscopy and BAL are usually normal. The treatment for NEHI is currently supportive and aimed at preventing hypoxemia and infection while maintaining nutritional support. Many affected infants develop failure to thrive with time. Corticosteroids are not helpful for improving symptoms in infants with NEHI as underlying inflammation is not a component of the disorder, evidenced by the lack of inflammatory cells on BAL or in lung tissue at biopsy. Despite persistent symptoms and a prolonged need for oxygen therapy, infants with NEHI usually have a favorable long-term outcome with no reported deaths directly related to NEHI, no respiratory failure, and no progression to end-stage lung disease or lung transplantation. However, some patients with NEHI have long-term morbidity with persistent symptoms due to hyperinflation and reactive airway disease and may relapse with hypoxemia during intercurrent respiratory infection.",

On plain chest radiographs, the affected lung is hyperlucent and relatively underperfused while maintaining normal or decreased lung volume, although it can be normal in appearance. CT findings of constrictive/obliterative bronchiolitis are characterized by: (1) air trapping, accentuated on expiration; (2) mosaic attenuation pattern; (3) bronchial wall thickening; (4) bronchiectasis; and (5) diminished small vessels. Although these CT findings should suggest a diagnosis of constrictive/obliterative bronchiolitis in children, other more common entities, such as acute viral bronchiolitis, should be considered unless air trapping and bronchiectasis are both present. Follow-up imaging study can be helpful in differentiating the changes of chronic postinfectious airway injury from acute viral bronchiolitis.

Most cases (75%) affect boys in an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, and girls account for 25% of cases and show both autosomal recessive inheritance and sometimes skewed lyonization of the X-linked gene. The genetic mutations result in impaired phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity leading to reduced superoxide production and impaired oxidative burst. This impaired phagocyte oxidative function results in impaired intracellular killing of catalase-positive bacterial organisms including Staphylococcus, Burkholderia cepacia, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas sp, as well as fungal organisms, particularly Aspergillus and Nocardia and Mycobacteria. CGD affects approximately one in 200,000\u2013250,000 live births in the United States. Affected children typically present within the first 2 years of life with recurrent infections in various locations due to this inability in intracellular killing of catalase-positive organisms. In children with CGD, the lungs are the most common location of infection followed by skin and gastrointestinal tract. Liver or bones may also be affected resulting in hepatic abscess and osteomyelitis, respectively. Approximately 80% of patients with CGD present with recurrent pneumonia from Aspergillus, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacteria. The definitive diagnosis of CGD is based on the neutrophile oxidative burst test or previously on the nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) test; genetic testing is also available. Early diagnosis of CGD in children is important because they can then be placed on \u00adprophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and appropriate patient education can occur so that prompt and proper treatment can be achieved when infection does occur. With advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CGD in children, their prognosis has improved and affected children now often survive into adulthood.",

In the past decade, bone marrow transplant has been increasingly performed to restore hematologic and immunologic competence after chemotherapy or radiation therapy in children with various neoplasms, immune deficiencies, and genetic disorders.

Graft-versus-host disease has been classified traditionally into two forms: acute and chronic. The acute form of GVHD usually develops within the first 100 days after bone marrow transplant and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In contrast, the chronic form of GVHD occurs later, more than 100 days after transplant.

The connective tissue diseases, now called rheumatologic disorders and auto immune disorders, have myriad manifestations in the lung with histologic changes in the interstitium, airways, vasculature, and pleura. It is this multicompartment involvement that characterizes such disorders histologically, sometimes with more specific lesions that implicate a specific disorder. Pleuritis (c) is a common feature of these disorders and may be active with cellular infiltrates or be present as pleural fibrosis with less prominent infiltrates. Airway changes may include lymphocytic or follicular bronchiolitis, constrictive bronchiolitis with \u00adsubepithelial fibrosis narrowing the bronchiolar lumen (d) and bronchiectasis.

These changes are \u00adpresent in all cases regardless of the underlying abnormality or the histologic pattern. While a variety of histologic patterns have been described in surfactant dysfunction mutations, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (surfactant C (j)), most cases do not present a single clearly defined pattern. An atypical proteinosis pattern is more frequent with surfactant B mutations (surfactant B (h, i)), a chronic pneumonitis of infancy pattern is more frequent with surfactant C mutations (surfactant C (j)), and ABCA3 shows proteinosis in a chunky fashion (r, s); however, no pattern is specific to a particular abnormality. While mutation analysis is the definitive diagnostic modality, ultrastructural changes in the lamellar bodies of type 2 pneumocytes can be quite helpful for more rapid categorization for prognosis and treatment decisions. These changes are quite specific for ABCA3 where there is a paucity of lamellar bodies (ABCA3 (p)) and those present are tiny, poorly lamellated, and contain a dense central inclusion (ABCA3 (t)). SpB mutations also show characteristic ultrastructural changes with fusion of lamellar and multivesicular bodies (surfactant B (f)) and absence of tubular myelin (surfactant B (g)); there are also reduced numbers of lamellar bodies, which are typically poorly lamellated (not shown). There are no characteristic lamellar body ultrastructural findings with SpC mutations, the type 2 pneumocytes may appear normal (surfactant C (m)), or there may be mild changes in the size and distribution of lamellar bodies (surfactant C (n))",

TTF-1 Histologic changes in the lung with TTF-1 mutations (d\u2013k) clearly vary, but there is limited information on the variety of changes seen. These images are from one case with quite severe lung disease that shows histologic abnormalities within the spectrum of the surfactant dysfunction mutations with diffuse involvement with lobular remodeling (d), intralveolar and distal airway debris with prominent numbers of cholesterol clefts (e), diffuse alveolar epithelial hyperplasia (f), proteinosis seen here as globular eosinophilic material (g), and mild patchy interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates (h). In addition to these changes that clearly link this disorder histologically with the surfactant dysfunction mutations, there may be other changes with metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium with lepidic spread i, somewhat atypical features (j), and mucin content (Movat stain (k)) that suggest the possibility of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma",

(c) CT reveals the classic centrally, anteriorly accentuated ground glass opacities of NEHI. (d) Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI): Cases of NEHI generally have a near normal histologic appearance, illustrated in the left upper two panels with hematoxylin and eosin stain where there are mild nonspecific changes including mild prominence of airway smooth muscle and a mild increase in alveolar \u00admacrophages; however, occasional cases may show prominence of airway-associated lymphoid tissue and mild peri-airway lymphocytic infiltrates, illustrated in the right upper two panels with hematoxylin and eosin stain, which overshadow the similar mild airway smooth muscle and macrophage increase. With this quite bland background, the histologic hallmark of NEHI is an increase in the proportion of neuroendocrine cells in small airways (lower four panels with immunostain for bombesin), where they often appear clustered in small groups and sheets, rather than as isolated cells; neuroepithelial bodies (bottom right) may be enlarged and/or numerous",

(Image courtesy of Dr. Paul Guillerman, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, Houston, TX.) Cases of PIG typically show at least some element of alveolar growth abnormality in the background as seen in (b) with enlarged airspaces. In PIG, the lobular interstitium is widened by an accumulation of bland appearing cells with abundant pale to bubbly cytoplasm (b\u2013d). Other features vary depending on the underlying conditions affecting the infant. There may be mild and patchy alveolar epithelial hyperplasia (b\u2013d); it is not a necessary feature and is almost never prominent and diffuse; there also may be \u00adpulmonary arterial changes of hypertensive vasculopathy (not illustrated). The large pale interstitial cells are immunopositive for vimentin (e), but not for macrophage or epithelial markers, suggesting that they are mesenchymal in type. Definitive diagnosis requires the \u00adidentification of these large bland interstitial cells by electron microscopy. These cells widen the alveolar interstitium (f); they have bland nuclei and a paucity of cytoplasmic organelles (g), and their cytoplasm contains abundant monoparticulate glycogen (e). The cells stain similarly to the glycan-rich matrix of early fibrosis with Movat pentachrome stain (h) and as fibrous tissue with trichrome stain(not shown), although there is no actual collagen deposition by electron microscopy. While in occasional cases the intracellular glycogen may be demonstrated by PAS staining with PAS-positive, diastase-sensitive interstitial staining (not illustrated), in most the glycogen is washed out during processing and the PAS stain is not positive",
