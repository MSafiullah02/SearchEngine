Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020 in all 3,139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without shelter in place orders. Results: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to < 10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% over the counties with no SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. Conclusions: Shelter in place orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US. Counties with a large population or a high population density were found to benefit the most from a shelter in place order.",

            "text": "Keywords: Shelter in place, social distancing, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Machine Learning, Statistics Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) originated in the province of Wuhan, China in December 2019, after which it spread rapidly across the globe due to infected persons exhibiting little to no symptoms within the first five days of contracting the virus. [1] The devastation and infection rate triggered by the virus caused the World Health Organization to declare it a global pandemic. There are currently over 170 countries infected with COVID-19, and all 50 states in the United States (US) have confirmed cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the US, community transmission has become the prominent mode of transmission of the virus. [2] It has therefore become imperative that the effectiveness of the primary forms of limiting social contact employed by local and national governments be evaluated. Enough data at the county level is now available to provide a fair assessment of the efficacy of the presidential guidelines on March 16, 2020, instituting a form of \"social distancing\" by limiting gatherings to 10 or fewer people. Data is additionally sufficient to assess the efficacy of county-level SIP orders versus counties that did not issue any SIP orders after the March 16 guidelines.",

[3] The data included in this study includes latitude, longitude, population, median age, number of physicians, median income, population/sq. mile, and water use per capita. Counties were placed into one of two bins: (1) counties that had confirmed cases of COVID-19 before March 16 guidelines and experienced a SIP order on or after March 19 (186 counties, referred to as wSIP); (2) counties that had confirmed cases before March 16 and experienced no SIP order (60 counties, referred to as noSIP). A Student t-test was used to compare two groups for significance. ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test was used to compare multiple groups. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. All data are reported as mean \u00b1 95% confidence interval. There were no statistically significant differences in the US census data between wSIP and noSIP apart from latitude (p<0.0001) and the number of physicians (p = 0.04). wSIP had a latitude of 39.47 \u00b1 0.75, which places it in the northern US, versus noSIP with a latitude of 34.6 \u00b1 1.16, placing it further south. The difference in number of physicians is a function of latitude with a lower mean number of physicians in the south (1,697 \u00b1 500) versus the north (2,677 \u00b1 538).",

            "text": "Compound growth was calculated using the equation: (final confirmed cases/first confirmed cases)^(1/number of days). Figure 1 shows the compound growth rate for wSIP (1.39 \u00b1 0.044) and noSIP (1.30 \u00b1 0.059) before the presidential guidelines on March 16, the compound growth rate after March 16 for wSIP (1.30 \u00b1 0.023) and noSIP (1.21 \u00b1 0.016), and the compound growth rate for wSIP (1.19 \u00b1 .011) after the SIP orders went into effect. The lower compound growth rates seen in noSIP data are due to the difference in latitude between the two datasets and suggest that southern states experienced a slower spread of the virus at the onset. This makes sense, given that before March 16, the hotspots for COVID-19 were northern states such as Washington, New York, and Illinois. The noSIP compound growth rates were normalized to the compound growth rate of wSIP data before March 16 to account for geographical differences. The normalized compound growth rates after March 16 were shown to be statistically similar between the wSIP and noSIP groups (p>0.05, Figure 1 ). This indicates that the presidential guidelines had the same magnitude of effect on reducing the compound growth rate by 6.6% \u00b1 1.4% between wSIP and noSIP before the wSIP group instituted a SIP. After instituting a SIP order, the wSIP group compound growth rate decreased an additional 7.8%, for a total decrease of 14.4% \u00b1 1.6% from the compound growth rates before March 16. This indicates that the effects from the presidential guidelines and SIP orders were additive in the US. This is reasonable considering the virus is thought to spread by viruscontaining airborne droplets and orders for social distancing limit the interaction of people who could potentially be infected. [5] A study modeling the effect of social distancing from China indicated a strong association with both a decrease in the rate the virus spreads and the implementation of social distancing. [6] A random forest machine learning model was trained to predict the compound growth rate after a SIP order was given in a county. Random forest was chosen as it has been shown to have the highest accuracy in disease prediction. [7] The model achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 92.3% on the test dataset. The three most important features were population, longitude, and population per square mile in predicting the compound growth rate after a SIP order was instituted in a county. The data for these features was split into four equal groups to explain how these features matter for the model in predicting the compound growth rate after a SIP was issued. Counties that instituted a SIP with a longitude between -79.7102\u00b0 and -97.2363\u00b0 had the l argest decrease in compound growth rate at 10.4% compared to 8.2% for counties outside of that longitudinal range. Counties with the highest populations between 143,962 to 984,8011 saw the largest percent reduction after instituting a SIP, at 10.5% compared to counties with a lower population between 7457 and 142,151 at 8.2%. Similar to population, population/sq. mile showed the largest reduction in compound growth rate in counties with a population/sq. mile between 405.8 to 1,755.5 at 11.6% compared to counties with a lower population density of 2.1 to 405.6 at 8.9%.",
