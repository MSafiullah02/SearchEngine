On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been humongous. The world is staring at an uncertain future and finding it extremely difficult to win the war against this virus. Health care delivery systems have been overwhelmed in many countries because of the rapidity of the spread of infection and substantial mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 infection. At the time of writing, there are more than 18 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases with more than 110,000 deaths globally.",

As per the epidemiological data from two parts of the country, namely Karnataka[2] and NCT of Delhi (unpublished data), a 1-year prevalence is more than 25%. Thus, at least one in four persons in India suffers from migraines. Even with a conservative estimate, at least 25% of these patients visit the physicians or hospitals periodically for the treatment of their migraine. Further, 2\u20134% of emergency department (ED) visits occur due to nontraumatic headaches[345] and out of that, about 35% of the visits occur due to migraines. It has been estimated that about 1.2 million migraine patients visit ED in Canada per year.[6]",

            "text": "Telemedicine should be practiced to minimize direct face-to-face visits. There shall be three groups of patients suffering from migraines. First will be those with diagnosed migraines which are infrequent. They need reassurance and minimal intervention. The second group of migraine patients will be those with frequent migraines with headache frequency falling in episodic range (4\u201314 headache days/month) and those with chronic migraine (>15 headache days/month). Both these groups shall need regular periodic consultations and optimization of their therapy. Great effort must be made to facilitate therapies that they can avail at home effectively so than the chances of their visits to ED or the clinic are minimized. Then, there will be patients with newly diagnosed migraines who will not only need viable treatment options but a lot of educational support as well. Headache disorders are primarily diagnosed by clinical history and only in a small proportion of patients additional investigations are required to rule out the secondary cause. Therefore, telemedicine can play a big role in the diagnosis and management of headache disorders provided physicians are aware of the diagnostic criteria and current treatment guidelines of migraine [Figure 1]. Also, physicians should be aware of the red flags which may suggest a secondary cause that may necessitate a face-to-face evaluation. Studies have already shown that telemedicine consultations when compared to face-to-face consultations, lead to an equally high satisfaction rate for the patients[7] and non-inferior outcome,[8] even in pediatric headaches.[9] American Academy of Neurology telemedicine workgroup has also shown the utility of telemedicine in chronic neurological diseases.[10] India has got one of the largest numbers of smart-phone (502.2 million)[11] and internet users (451 million).[12] Most Indian families, therefore, can access and use telemedicine. With the current availability of various apps which can facilitate real-time interactive audio and video communication between patients and doctor who are placed remotely from each other, teleconsultations are possible. There have been concerns about the use of prescriptions, patient\u2019s confidentiality and privacy, issues regarding physicians licensing, malpractices, and modalities of reimbursement. All these issues are complex. However, due to the current unprecedented situation where social and physical distancing for both patients and doctors are needed, telemedicine is possibly the easiest way to provide effective and satisfactory treatment to migraine patients. Hence, the professional bodies, organizations of doctors, and health authorities must facilitate such an approach and advocacy groups should advise the government for reframing laws, regulations, coding, and reimbursement options. Even in the foreseeable future when staggered ease of lock-down will be contemplated by the government, patients need not travel long distances to come to doctors\u2019 clinics or hospitals; thereby, decreasing the chance of their exposure to COVID-19 infection. Physicians can also supply some common educational material or provide references for good and reliable internet sites where many of the frequently asked questions about migraine and its management are answered. However, since a large number of Indian population is illiterate or does not know English, resource material in vernacular languages or verbal communication including posting a simple video of dos and don\u2019ts for migraine sufferers can be of much value.",

Therefore, any new-onset severe headache or worsening of existing headache in terms of frequency and severity or change in the character of existing headache under current circumstances must raise suspicion of COVID-19 infection. These patients must be asked about their exposure risk and should be assessed in detail for co-existing symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pains, sore throat, chills, nausea and vomiting, nasal congestion, and diarrhea that have been associated with COVID-19 infection.",

The reason may be an abundance of migraine triggers. Recurrent migraine triggers play a significant role not only in precipitating migraine attacks in susceptible individuals but also in maintaining a continuous cycle of pain which may be difficult to disrupt. This is more so in the time of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown which has resulted in anxiety, depression, social isolation, and changes in daily routine and activity. Following the lockdown in India, a lot of movement of migrant workers across the states has taken place. These individuals are also vulnerable to recurrent migraine attacks due to unusual physical exertion, hunger, and considerable mental stress (which all are potent migraine triggers). Due to the increased frequency of attacks in either group, these patients are prone to overuse acute medications and also many of them may visit ED simply because they become non-responsive to the usual acute medications. Hence, it is important that acute therapies for treating migraine attacks should be used judiciously in these patients. The patients should be advised to use acute medications in the early phase of headache with adequate doses so that they get an optimum response.[15] Inadequate treatment of acute attacks is an important cause of migraine chronification.[16]",

There were some initial concerns about the uses of Ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients as WHO suggested that NSAIDs may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms.[17] However, this recommendation was retracted later. As per the latest FDA guideline, it has been suggested that there is no scientific data that suggests the role of NSAID in worsening of COVID-19 symptoms, although the agency is further investigating in the matter.[18] However, because of changing dynamics of COVID-19 pandemics and convergence of new data from affected countries, recommendations may change and clinicians should be vigilant about updating themselves with changing recommendations. Triptans and antiemetics like metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, and prochlorperazine can also be considered for acute therapy. Sometimes, these can be advised in combination to ameliorate a severe acute attack.[19] Some of the newer acute treatment options that have been approved by the FDA in 2019 namely small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists called Gepants (ubrogepant and rimegepants) and 5HT-1F agonist called \u201cditans\u201d (lasmiditan) are not available in India yet but have been used in the US as acute therapy of migraine. New neuromodulation devices have been shown to be effective for both acute and preventive therapy of migraines and can be home delivered in the US and Europe. However, most of these devices are costly and are not available in India. Table 1 lists the acute treatment options.",

To limit these emergency visits, a number of strategies have been suggested which however do not have an adequate evidence base. It has been suggested that NSAIDs, neuroleptics, longer-acting triptans, and anti-epileptics like valproate may be advised for a short period of 5\u20137 days to break the headache cycle.[19] It is advisable to add a proton pump inhibitor to decrease gastric irritation when the NSAIDs are given for a longer period of time. These have been tabulated in Table 2. Another useful drug in this situation that has been used clinically during non-COVID times, namely corticosteroids should be avoided. CDC recommends this because corticosteroids have been shown to prolong viral replication in MERS-COV patients.[20] An alternate route of drug administration for acute medications may also be tried such as intranasal lidocaine, ketorolac, and dihydroergotamine. Unfortunately, these are not easily available in India. However, side effects potentials of these drugs are high and hence only a patient who can understand the potential risk-benefit of these treatments can be considered for this. By and large, opioids and barbiturates should be avoided. Physicians should refrain as far as possible to use drugs like tramadol and ergotamine preparations (ergotamine with combinations like barbiturates and caffeine) as there is a great risk of producing medication overuse headache which shall be very difficult to treat in the home setting.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) such as candesartan and lisinopril have been found to be useful as a migraine preventive.[21] There have been some concerns regarding their use because angiotensin receptor type 2 has been shown to be the entry point of the human cells for SERS-COV. However, at the moment there are no clinical or experimental data showing an adverse outcome of using ACEI, ARB, and renin-angiotension-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonist in COVID-19 patients. Hence, in patients who are already on these medications because of cardiovascular disease or migraine and incidentally acquire COVID-19 infection, the clinician should judge the risk-benefit ratio for the continuation of these agents in these patients on a case to case basis.[22] However, ACEI and ARB may not be considered as the first choice in migraine patients who need to be started on a new preventive medication.",

            "text": "Many patients of migraines on single preventive therapy may not derive adequate benefit especially those with chronic migraines, and hence, the combination of preventive medications may be needed. Literature is scanty in this regard. However, a combination of propranolol and flunarizine is available in India. Propranolol or flunarizine can also be combined with amitriptyline in many of these patients. It is better to combine drugs with different mechanisms of action.[23] Further, drugs like melatonin and other nutriceuticals like magnesium, riboflavin and coenzyme Q can also be combined with first-line agents if they do not produce an adequate response.[24] Botulinum toxin and greater occipital nerve blocks are minimally invasive procedures and require close contact with the patients. They should be avoided in the current situation. Recently monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CGRP and CGRP receptors have been approved by the FDA as preventive therapy for episodic and chronic migraines. Three of these mAbs namely erenumab, galcanezumab, and fremanezumab can be self-injected by autoinjector at home subcutaneously every month.[2526272829303132] However, these products are yet to be approved in India. Because of their high cost, these are generally recommended for those patients who have failed at least two first-line preventive drugs given at optimum dose and duration of time.[33] However, because of their salutary effects, there are reports of patients braving the odds of lockdown for getting these medications from the hospitals in Italy.[34]",

Working for grueling shifts of 6\u20138 h wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), self quarantining themselves for the next 16\u201318 h and then again reporting for duty has been an extremely demanding task for them. In a recent study,[36] it was found that 81% of HCW developed de novo PPE associated headaches. More interestingly, a preexisting primary headache and PPE wearing for >4 h were independently associated with the development of PPE associated headaches. 90% with pre-existing primary headaches reported that with PPE usage their background headaches became uncontrolled resulting in poor performance. I have been telephonically contacted by six doctors and nurses in the last month who are on COVID-19 ICU duty that their migraines were getting out of hand. A simple 10-point advice prepared by us can help the HCW with migraine as how to manage their migraines during the COVID-19 pandemic [Table 4].",

Migraine patients prefer a regulated routine life because by the experience they know that it helps. Lifestyles and daily routines have however been modified to a large extent due to lockdown. However, migraine patients should be advised to try to stick to a routine as much as possible. For example, persons working from home should continue to do work as they were doing from the office and take the necessary breaks. They should eat at regular intervals. They should stop the work at the stipulated time and may change their clothes as they were doing after coming home. Maintaining regular sleep cycle, doing aerobic exercises, taking regular meals, maintaining good hydration by drinking adequate fluids, reducing stress by doing meditation, yoga, and avoiding known triggers can be very rewarding in preventing migraine attacks. A regular and good diet is also important to boost up immunity. Social isolation can be circumvented by interacting in social media, talking to friends and relatives. It is important to share how one is feeling. Suicides have been reported after the onset of the pandemic due to panic, isolation, fear, and psychological trauma and previous experience with the SARS epidemic has also shown a spike in suicide rates especially among the elderly.[37] Chronic migraine patients, especially those with aura have increased suicidal ideation and attempts and these are independently associated with migraine frequency.[38] Hence, during the COVID-19 pandemic where there is likely to be an increased frequency of migraine attacks due to multiple factors, these patients shall be at higher risk of suicides than the general population. Physicians should suggest helplines and other internet-based resources to migraine patients for their mental health problems. Finally, the general care for preventing the COVID-19 infection should be reemphasized by the physicians, namely social distancing, frequent handwashing with soap or sanitizer, minimal face touching, and general hygiene. Sanitizers and soaps with strong odors should be avoided as they can trigger a migraine attack.",
