The coordination environments of catalytic and structural sites are rather well defined (Auld 2001). However, a consensus is lacking on what defines regulatory zinc sites structurally. Binding of zinc to such sites has to occur in a range of physiological zinc(II) ion concentrations. Only now are concepts emerging to indicate how cellular zinc is buffered and what the physiologically relevant concentrations of zinc(II) ions are. With this knowledge, one can begin to discuss the significance of what are presumed to be regulatory zinc sites in proteins.",

            "text": "In the cell, each metal ion is maintained in a certain range of concentrations in order not to interfere with the functions of other metal ions (Maret 2010). Once metal ions exceed their normal physiological concentrations, they bind at sites where they normally do not bind. The ranges of physiological free metal ion concentrations are largely determined by the relative affinities of divalent metal ions for proteins as described by the Irving\u2013Williams series in inorganic chemistry: Mg < Ca < Mn < Fe < Co < Ni < Zn > Cu. Consequently, zinc(II) ions bind much stronger to proteins than transition metal ions such as iron(II) and manganese(II) or alkaline earth metal ions such as Mg(II) and Ca(II). The total cellular zinc concentrations are rather high, i.e. hundreds of micromolar. Cellular buffering of zinc results in free zinc(II) ion concentrations in the range of tens to hundreds of picomolar (often given as the \u201czinc potential\u201d, pZn = \u2212log[Zn2+] = 10\u201311) (Colvin et al. 2010). These concentrations are commensurate with the affinities of zinc(II) ions for cytosolic zinc-requiring metalloproteins, which are picomolar or lower (Maret and Li 2009). Accordingly, reported micromolar zinc inhibition of cytosolic enzymes is not physiologically significant because the free zinc(II) ion concentrations are the determining factor and not the total zinc concentrations.",

These recent developments, in particular quantitative data about cellular zinc(II) ion concentrations, the control of cellular zinc homeostasis, and the role of zinc(II) ions as cellular signalling ions, led us to re-examine the structure and function of putative regulatory zinc sites in proteins.",

In search for enzymes that are strongly zinc-inhibited, several were found to be inhibited much tighter than reported (Maret et al. 1999). Many, but not all of them, contain a catalytic cysteine residue, e.g. caspases, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), aldehyde dehydrogenases, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Zinc at nanomolar concentrations inhibits these enzymes. Among the ones investigated, caspase-3 was found to be inhibited the strongest with 50 % inhibition at concentrations below 10 nM zinc (Maret et al. 1999).",

Most of the enzymes that rely on a catalytic cysteine are stored in buffers containing both a reducing agent and a chelating agent to preserve their activities. For assaying zinc inhibition, these agents must be removed. Thiols bind metal ions and can be replaced with the reducing agent triscarboxyethylphosphine. The enzymatic assay to detect zinc inhibition has to be sufficiently sensitive to perform measurements at enzyme concentrations near or below the inhibition constants. Zinc(II) ion concentrations cannot be readily controlled below nanomolar concentrations unless metal-buffering agents are employed. The zinc content of buffers and other reagents, the zinc concentrations of chelating and reducing agents, and the pH all need to be known. Without control of these parameters unexpected results can be obtained: either zinc ions are found in 3D structures of proteins when none are expected or inhibitory zinc ions are absent in 3D structures despite of experimental evidence for zinc inhibition.",

However, these values are based on activity assays that are usually performed above the K\nm value for the substrate to attain maximum velocities. If the substrate and zinc compete for the same site, there will be significant competition at high substrate concentrations and the measured K\ni value will be quite different from the true K\ni value. In the case of human receptor PTP \u03b2, an inhibition analysis at varying concentrations of both substrate and zinc gave a K\ni of 21 pM (pH 7.4) for zinc (Wilson et al. 2012). The inhibition is competitive, indicating binding of zinc in the active site containing the catalytic cysteine (residue 1094). Additional ligands of zinc could be an aspartate (1870) and/or a histidine (1871) located on the conformationally flexible WPD loop.",

However, the assay and co-crystallization conditions are most likely significantly different as the enzyme was assayed in 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 while the crystallization was performed in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH not reported). A structure in the absence of zinc (RCSB PDB 2HHN) was also reported. It was obtained after the crystals were soaked with 4 mM dithiothreitol to reduce the catalytic cysteine.

            "text": "Another family of cysteine proteinases are caspases. Zinc inhibition of caspase-3 was noted with a K\ni value of about 100 nM (Perry et al. 1997), but the inhibition occurs with an IC50 of <10 nM zinc (Maret et al. 1999). The compound PAC-1 binds zinc with a K\nd of 42 nM and activates procaspase-3 by removing the inhibitory zinc(II) ions (Petersen et al. 2009). Caspase-6 is also an executioner caspase. Zinc inhibits the human enzyme allosterically at a site involving Lys-36, Glu-244, and His-287 as ligands with a K\ni of 150 nM (pH 7.5) (Velazquez-Delgado and Hardy 2012). When zinc binds to the allosteric site and locks the enzyme in the helical conformation, the histidine and cysteine residues in the catalytic dyad are 9 \u00c5 apart and hence do not bind zinc. However, when the enzyme adopts the canonical conformation, zinc is thought to bind to the catalytic dyad. Recruitment of the \u03b5-amino group of lysine as a ligand is quite unusual. It may also occur in zinc-inhibited glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, where a catalytic lysine, an aspartate and another lysine are part of the active site (Ou et al. 2006). The enzyme is inhibited with an IC50 of 100 nM, but only at slightly alkaline pH 8.4 (Maret et al. 2001). This pH effect could indicate the ionization of the lysine(s) in the active site. Zinc inhibition of caspase-6 at two sites demonstrates that zinc inhibition of enzymes is more subtle than presently acknowledged and can regulate activity at least at two levels on the same enzyme\u2014without accounting for the interaction of caspases with zinc-binding domains of inhibitory proteins. The zinc inhibition constant of the executioner caspase-9 is 300 nM (pH 7.5). Caspase-9 binds two zinc ions. The model indicates that His-237, Cys-239, both forming the catalytic dyad, and Cys-287 bind one zinc and that His-224, Cys-229, -230 and -272 bind a second zinc (Huber and Hardy 2012). The second site has the characteristics of a structural zinc site. Caspases-3, -6, -7, -8, -9 are all involved in apoptosis and have the catalytic Cys\u2013His dyad, but they differ with regard to the third active site residue possibly involved in metal binding, which is Asp, Glu, or Cys. Based on sequence homology among caspases, the zinc-binding site in caspase-3 comprises His-121, Asp-123, and Cys-163.",

The free zinc(II) ion concentration in muscle of 32 pM (Ray 1969) indicates that zinc inhibits the enzyme under physiological conditions and that the enzyme needs to be activated by removing the inhibitory zinc.",

Since free thiols are rare in extracellular enzymes, the amino acids involved in metal binding of extracellular proteins are mainly glutamate (aspartate) and histidine. Some subcellular vesicles have relatively high free zinc(II) ion concentrations. Micromolar zinc(II) ion concentrations inhibit bovine carboxypeptidase A at a second zinc-binding site next to the catalytic zinc (K\ni = 0.5 \u03bcM). Zinc also inhibits serine proteases such as kallikreins with inhibition constants ranging from 10 nM to about 10 \u03bcM. In the case of carboxypeptidase A, the inhibitory zinc binds to only one protein ligand (Glu-270) but is also held in place by a hydroxy bridge to the catalytic zinc ion. In the kallikreins, the zinc ligands are either two histidines or a histidine and a glutamate. A third ligand may further stabilize the zinc/protein interaction. A case can be made for physiological significance of these interactions because some kallikreins are found in seminal and prostatic fluids, which contain about 10 mM zinc. Presumably, the inhibitory zinc dissociates when these enzymes are secreted and diluted. Secreted zinc(II) ions are also involved in intercellular zinc signalling. Zinc(II) ions released into the synapse from zinc-rich neurons inhibit the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor postsynaptically. The inhibition constant is <10 nM (pH 7.3) (Paoletti et al. 1997).",

At least three different principles now demonstrate how zinc(II) ions inhibit enzymes: inhibition through binding at the active site of enzymes that are not zinc metalloenzymes or are magnesium metalloenzymes, allosteric inhibition, and inhibition of zinc enzymes such as carboxypeptidase by binding of a second zinc(II) ion near the catalytic zinc(II) ion. An inhibitory role may seem counterintuitive as zinc activates proteins in the form of zinc metalloenzymes. However, regulatory activation is generally not considered because zinc enzymes are thought to always contain their metal ion. This tenet is based on the observation that isolated zinc enzymes usually have a full complement of zinc. The issue whether or not the zinc content of zinc metalloenzymes varies dependent on physiological conditions has not been tested rigorously, in particular because zinc proteins are now rarely isolated from their original tissues but instead prepared from heterologous expression systems. Zinc(II) ions may also modulate (activate or inhibit) catalytic activity in co-catalytic zinc sites of zinc enzymes with dinuclear sites.",

The K\ni values are in the range of the K\nd values for zinc in zinc enzymes. Active sites of many enzymes contain two metal-binding amino acid side chains, i.e. catalytic dyads of Cys\u2013Cys, His\u2013His, Glu(Asp)\u2013Glu(Asp), Cys\u2013His, Glu(Asp)\u2013His, Cys\u2013Glu(Asp), and sometimes catalytic triads with three of these amino acids. Enzymes such as serine and cysteine proteinases or ribonucleases, e.g. angiogenins (Iyer et al. 2013) (Table 1) are therefore prone to be metal inhibited. From the limited number of structures available (Table 1), the coordination environments of inhibitory sites at the active sites or allosteric sites of enzymes do not appear to differ significantly from the typical ligand environments of catalytic zinc in zinc metalloenzymes except for a tendency for lower coordination numbers in regulatory zinc sites. It appears that zinc binding is employed to keep some enzymes in an inactive state and that they need to be activated by removing the inhibitory zinc(II) ions, i.e. a function opposite from that of catalytic zinc (Fig. 1). One can also argue that the composition of the active sites of many enzymes makes it necessary to control free zinc(II) ions at very low concentrations to avoid wide-spread zinc inhibition at active sites. Therefore, weak interactions of zinc with cytosolic proteins are thought not to be physiologically relevant and reference to free cellular zinc(II) ions as weakly or loosely bound zinc is misleading.\n",

There is no knowledge on whether or not zinc is regulatory in any of these proteins. Without insight into the structure of regulatory sites, such sites are not accounted for in bioinformatics approaches. Ligands of regulatory (inhibitory) zinc sites cannot be readily identified in the primary sequences of proteins. The reason is that such sites often do not have the relatively short amino acid spacers between the ligands that made the recognition of signatures and prediction of catalytic and structural sites so successful. The active sites of proteins are often made from amino acids that are brought into proximity in the 3D structure but are distant in the primary structure. Thus, the recognition of inhibitory zinc sites faces the same challenges as the identification of active sites in proteins. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the number of such sites from bioinformatics approaches but it appears that zinc/protein interactions are even more numerous than indicated by the estimate of about 3,000 human proteins. For identification of regulatory sites, several approaches need to be employed and combined, namely quantitative data about binding constants, structural characterizations, investigations of the zinc(II) ion concentrations and their fluctuations in the cell, and correlations with functional outcomes and metabolic effects for zinc-inhibited enzymes such as aconitase (Costello et al. 1997) and ornithine transcarbamoylase (Shi et al. 2001) (Table 1).",

For the sake of being comprehensive, coordination dynamics are essential for another mechanism of zinc enzyme inhibition. In metalloproteinases, a fourth zinc ligand, either a cysteine or an aspartate, is employed to keep the enzyme inhibited (Springman et al. 1990; Guevara et al. 2010).
