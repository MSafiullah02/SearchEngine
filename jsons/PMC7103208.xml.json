            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are a heterogeneous group of potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with the unique capacity to prime naive T-cell responses [1]. In order to fulfil their role as sentinels of the immune system, they express several families of specialized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for particular pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) all reacting directly with pathogen components [2], [3], [4]. In addition, many other receptors exist such as Fc receptors and activated complement component receptors, reacting with complexes of pathogen antigen with antibody or complement. Another element essential to DC biology is their migratory behaviour in response to chemokine gradients. DCs are the main cellular element controlling T lymphocyte activation and regulation. Furthermore, they are involved in B-cell responses, possibly through the delivery of native antigen to B lymphocytes [5], [6], [7], but certainly through the production of B-cell stimulatory factors important for B-cell proliferation, differentiation and isotype switching [8], [9]. DCs also play a functional role for NK cell activation [10], [11], and are in a two-way communication with neutrophils [12].",

An important element therein is the functional and phenotypic differentiation of \u201cconventional DC\u201d (cDC) from \u201cplasmacytoid DC\u201d (pDC). The term cDC summarizes all DC subsets with \u201cprofessional antigen presenting\u201d function, while pDC represent the \u201cprofessional interferon-\u03b1 producers\u201d [13]. Indeed, pDC are also referred to as \u201cnatural interferon producing cells\u201d (NIPC), a functional entity first described 25 years ago [14]. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that also pDC have important antigen-presenting functions and that the two DC subsets complement each others by having a distinct regulation of MHC class I- and II-dependent antigen presentation [15], [16], [17]. Furthermore, DCs show a high level of heterogeneity, particularly in the specialized roles of various DC subsets dependent on their tissue localization and local immunological environment, which guides their function (Table 1\n).",

Being strategically located at sites of pathogen entry, such as mucosal surfaces and dermal layers, DC can rapidly interact with pathogen PAMPs resulting in cell activation, pathogen uptake and degradative processing of the pathogen (antigen). A critical element therein is the concomitant uptake of antigen with PAMP recognition. The latter represents the \u201cdanger\u201d signalling which the DC requires to be activated. In the absence of the \u201cdanger\u201d signal, the DCs tend to function more as tolerogenic DC, inducing lymphocyte anergy. Such processes are involved in responses to self-antigens and tolerance of food antigens.",

The latter relates to a prolonged capacity for efficient presentation of the endocytosed and processed antigen [18]. With completion of the DC maturation process, important biological changes occur to the DC. Chemokine receptor expression is modified, enabling migration to the inductive sites of the adaptive immune system. For example, the CCR1 and CCR5 receptors for inflammatory chemokines such as CCL3 and CCL5 are down-regulated, while the CCR7 receptor for CCL19 and CCL21 is up-regulated [8]. The latter provides DC with the signal for entry into the inductive sites of the adaptive immune system such as the lymph node. DC activation also results in an increase of cell surface MHC and co-stimulatory molecule expression\u2014such as CD80 and CD86\u2014as well as the production of immunoregulatory and/or inflammatory cytokines. MHC class II antigenic peptide complexes are stabilized on the cell surface to ensure efficient stimulation of T-cell responses. Overall, the induced functional changes are usually associated with increased T-lymphocyte stimulatory capacity, although this depends on the stimulus received [19].",

This has also been possible through the availability of antibodies against cell surface markers classified in three international swine CD workshops [20], [21], [22] and studies using crossreactive antibodies\u2014summarized in Table 2\n.

            "text": "Similar to other species, porcine DC can be generated by stimulating blood monocytes with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). After 3\u20137 days of culture, non-adherent or loosely adherent cells with dendritic morphology can be harvested [23], [24]. Generation of monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) in vitro can also employ a GM-CSF/IFN-\u03b1 combination. This can prove more potent than the GM-CSF/IL4 method when seeking DC for restimulating virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells [25]. Addition of IFN-\u03b1 to the GM-CSF/IL-4 cocktail also influences the DC, resulting in an enhanced T-cell stimulatory capacity in mixed leukocyte cultures [26]. In fact, cytokine modulation is important for manipulating the type of DC generated. TGF-\u03b2 permits the generation of cells with Langerhans cell characteristics [24], while PAMPs modulate mRNA expression levels for particular TLRs [27]. Bautista et al. [28] have also demonstrated that IL-4 can be replaced by IL-13 for the generation of MoDC. Phenotypically, porcine MoDC are characterized as CD1+CD14+CD16+CD80/86+CD172a+ and MHC class II+\n[23], [24], [28], [29], [30] (Table 1). From a comparative immunological point of view, it was unexpected to find CD14, because human CD14 is considered to be a typical monocyte/macrophage rather than a DC marker [8]. Nevertheless, MoDC from other species such as cat, cattle and dog have also been shown to express CD14 [31]. Of the other markers, the CD172a was expected due to its classification as the porcine swine workshop cluster 3 (SWC3) antigen expressed on cells of the myelomonocytic lineage [32]. It is expressed on many monocytic and granulocytic cells quite early during their differentiation [33]. Functionally, this marker represents the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP-\u03b1). Altogether, the co-expression of CD172a and CD1 along with relatively high levels of both CD80/86 and MHC class II represent phenotypic characteristics of porcine MoDC but no marker clearly differentiating them from monocyte-derived macrophages has been identified.",

Addition of stem cell factor to the GM-CSF/TNF-\u03b1 cocktail increases the yield of DC obtained [37]. In contrast to GM-CSF, Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) stimulation induces the differentiation of both cDC and pDC, similar to the situation with human and mouse BMHC [13] (Guzylack-Piriou and Summerfield, unpublished data). Furthermore, Flt3L-induced BMHC-derived cDC phenotypically and functionally differ from GM-CSF-derived DC either generated with monocytes or BMHC. Flt3L induces the differentiation of CD14\u2212 cDC which are more sensitive to stimulation by TLR2/TLR6, TR3, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR7 ligands in terms of cytokine responses and maturation [38] (Guzylack-Piriou and Summerfield, unpublished data).

After in vitro culture, these cells strongly up-regulate MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, and their dendritic morphology becomes clear. Based on these characteristics, we have proposed that this population contains the precursors of blood cDC. These cells have variable expression of CD1 and CD16 and can be differentiated from monocytes by lower levels of CD172a (Fig. 1 and [40]). Although the majority of porcine blood monocytes are CD1\u2212CD4\u2212CD14+CD16+ CD172a+ (Table 1 and Fig. 1), a detailed analysis of the monocytic population has identified at least four subsets based on CD14 and CD163 [44]. It is currently not clear how the blood cDC population phenotypically defined as CD172a+CD4\u2212CD14\u2212 cell relates the CD14\u2212CD163+ monocytic cell. CD163 is proposed as a macrophage marker, which is up-regulated during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages [45] but down-regulated if monocytes are induced to differentiate into DC by GM-CSF/IL-4 [30]. This would argue for two distinct subsets of cells, a point which is not surprising considering the diversity of the DC family, but still requires further clarification (see also Dominguez et al., this volume).",

            "text": "With the major site for pathogen entry being through the mucosa of the respiratory and digestive tract, it is not surprising that most lymphocytes are in the mucosalassociated lymphoid tissues (MALT). Consequently, it is essential to regulate the mucosal immune responses against harmless microorganisms and food antigens in contact with the mucosae. This is a major role played by mucosal DC and is reflected by their anatomical localization in the mucosal tissues. They can mediate tolerance to self-antigens and harmless entities, while acting as sentinels sensing the danger posed by invading pathogens and deleterious entities. The first report on porcine mucosal DC described a putative DC in Peyer's patches (PP) as MHCII+ cell lacking T- and B-cell markers [60]. In the lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine the presence of an MHCII+CD172a+CD11R1+ CD16+ DC subset was demonstrated [46]. Bimczok and colleagues [47] further characterized DC in other immunological sites of the gut and proposed four phenotypically distinct subsets of DC based on the expression of CD11R1 and CD172a. LP DC are mainly CD172a+ CD11R1+, PP DC are mainly CD172a+CD11R1\u2212 in subepithelial domes and CD172a\u2212CD11R1\u2212 in interfollicular regions, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) DC are mostly CD172a\u2212 CD11R1+. Interestingly, only the CD11R1+ DC subsets were present in lymph, suggesting that DC migration to MLN originates largely from the LP. With respect to antigen sampling a rare population of LP DC extending cytoplasmic processes between enterocytes have been described [61]. In the PP, it appears that antigen transfer from M cells to DC is an important process, as many DC in the subepithelial dome have been demonstrated to be adjacent to M cells [61].",

This would indicate a possible down-regulation of this molecule during the maturation and migration process, and would be supported by the observed expression of CD172a on MoDC, BMDC generated using either GM-CSF or Flt3L, as well as circulating blood DC [23], [37], [38]. Nevertheless, with in vitro maturation studies using MoDC, BMDC as well as blood DC [23], [57], [58], [63], [64] no loss of CD172a was observed indicating that additional factors would be required for this process.

Considering that the capacity of gut DC to produce retinoic acid (RA) is a requirement for many of these functions and that gut DC are likely to be themselves under the influence of RA derived from gut epithelial cells, we have tested whether porcine MoDC can acquire the function of gut mucosal DC. After treatment of porcine MoDC with RA the DC acquired the capacity to promote a4b7 integrin and CCR9 on T lymphocytes, to secrete TGF-\u03b2 and to promote IgA responses [75]. We have extended these studies and also demonstrated that RA induces the expression of retinaldehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of RA. The drug-mediated inhibition of this enzyme in RA-treated DC abrogated their capacity to promote mucosal homing receptors expression on lymphocytes (Saurer and Summerfield, unpublished data). This underlines the important role of tissue-specific factors in governing DC function.",

Since this was associated with high levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 and only few IFN-\u03b1 producing cells were identified in other organs it appears that during an enteropathic virus infection IFN-\u03b1 would almost exclusively originate from gut pDC triggered locally. The rapid IFN-\u03b1 response of pDC as early as 6 h after infection would imply that pDC are present in mucosal tissue fulfilling their role as sentinels. This relates to the recently identified CCR9 expression and migration of mouse pDC to the small intestine under steady-state conditions [76] and also to the presence of pDC identified as CD172a+CD4+ cells in tonsils and MLN of healthy pigs [49].",

Fibrocytes have been described for mice, humans and pigs [25], [79], [80], and represent 0.5\u20131% of nucleated cells in peripheral blood. They express CD13 and CD34, which would suggest a haematopoietic origin, possibly myeloid. The presence of CD14, CD16 and CD172a on porcine fibrocytes [25], and the differentiation of human fibrocytes in vitro from a blood-derived CD14+ population [81] support this hypothesis. Porcine fibrocytes originate from a CD163+ PBMC subpopulation [82]. Fibrocytes are important during wound healing, rapidly entering sites of injury together with inflammatory leukocytes [80]. They are also an important source of cytokines and chemokines important for T lymphocyte and DC development. These include IL-6, IL-10, macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, MIP-1b and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [83].",

These cells activate CD4+ T cells, but also efficiently stimulate virus-specific CD8+ CTL. In fact, fibrocytes are effective at low ratios with T lymphocytes, ratios at which MoDC are less efficient [25]. Porcine fibrocytes also respond to TLR ligands by producing large quantities of IL-6 [82]. These TLR ligands include LPS (TLR4-ligand), lipopeptide (diacylated form recognized by TLR1/TLR2 heterodimers; triacylated form recognized by TLR2/TLR6 heterodimers), and TLR7 ligands [82].",

Similar to human DC, both porcine MoDC and blood cDC have been reported to be unreceptive to the TLR9 ligand CpG-ODN, when analysed for MHC class II and CD80/86 expression [58]. Nevertheless, MoDC express TLR9 mRNA [27], [38], and CpG-ODN can induce the mRNA of TLR4, TLR9, IFN-g and IL12 p35, as well as increased levels MHC class II as well as CD80/86 [27]. Such discrepancies between the studies may have been caused by sequence differences in the ODN employed or may reflect differences in the responsive status of the cells employed. For example, the relatively modest increase of CD80/86 and MHC class II expression on MoDC after TLR stimulation is synergistically enhanced in the presence of IFN-\u03b1 [64]. In this study it was also shown that a full phenotypic maturation only occurred during antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. We have also observed that in contrast to MoDC, Flt3-ligand derived BMDC are clearly more responsiveness to a range of TLR ligands including TLR2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 (Guzylack-Piriou and Summerfield, unpublished data).",

While polyIC, LPS, LTA, and CpG induced the Th1 promoting cytokines IL12 and IFN-g, the Th2-like cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 were induced only by LPS and LTA (Table 3). Raymond et al. [27] also demonstrated that similar to human and mouse DC, the cytokine response of porcine DC can be modulated by cytokines. For example, IL-12p35 mRNA can be enhanced with TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 and reduced with IL-10 treatment of DC. Along the same line, the Th1/Th2 cytokine profile will depend on the type of antigen encountered [88]. At the protein level MoDC have been reported to produce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 after stimulation with poly(IC), LPS, OprI and Pam3Cys (both TLR2 ligands), while production of IL-10 and IL-12 has been difficult to detect by ELISA [34], [35], [75], [87]. Related to the stimulation by these specific TLR ligands is the cytokine response of MoDC to heat-inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in terms of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 secretion [26]. MoDC also produce type I IFN after stimulation with poly(IC) and mRNA transfection [28], [36], [87]. The latter is dependent on the secondary structure of the mRNA molecule forming dsRNA structures [36].",

This relates to the fact that the DC family has a high diversity to deal with the varying environments and signals it receives in vivo from the local tissue environment and from pathogens. With in vitro analyses, it is only possible to reproduce a small fraction of this diverse scene. Therefore, what we are observing in vitro is true for the conditions being created, but can not be taken as a general rule for all DC subsets under all conditions in vivo.",

However, the notable trait of pDC is their ability to produce INF-\u03b1 Similar to the human and mouse immune system, porcine pDC are the most potent producers of INF-\u03b1 after stimulation with certain PAMPs. These PAMPs are the CpG type A motifs [58] and TLR7/8 ligands such as R837 [89]. Such characteristics show a particularly close relationship to the human DC system [13]; pDC respond to TLR7 and 9 ligands, whereas cDC such as MoDC tend to recognize more TLR2-4 ligands. In contrast, murine DC and macrophages also respond well to TLR9 ligands, although it is again the pDC which produce large quantities of IFN-( [13]. Dependent on the stimulus, porcine pDC also produce large quantities of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and as mentioned above IL-12 [58], [89]. It is this IL-12 induction, which distinguishes porcine pDC from their human counterparts [13].",

Generally, such receptors recognize viral replication occurring in situ\u2014being cytosolic, these PRR will detect the intermediates, which are also usually cytosolic. While RIG-I can sense 5\u2032-triphosphorylated singlestranded RNA, MDA-5 appears to be more specific for dsRNA, but the fine specifity within the helicase system is not entirely clear [91]. Although these receptors are ubiquitously expressed, their important role in the interaction of cDC with viruses has been demonstrated [92]. This is different with the endosomal PRR, all members of the TLR family including TLR3, 7, 8 and 9, which are expressed only on cells playing a specialized role in innate immune responses such as DC. TLR3 represents a receptor for dsRNA, TLR7 and 8 for single-stranded RNA and TLR9 for CpG-motif containing DNA. TLR3 will not only sense viruses with dsRNA genomes but also endocytosed dsRNA replicative intermediates produced during the replicative cycle of singlestranded RNA viruses, released from dying cells in the vicinity.",

This monocytotropic, haemorrhagic RNA virus replicates efficiently in cDC without apparently inducing their activation or maturation [87]. The lack of DC activation is not due to the absence of a trigger, because the virus generates a dsRNA intermediate in infected MoDC theoretically capable of stimulating RLRs. CSFV actively prevents the cDC response to dsRNA through its non-structural Npro protein targeting the IRF-3 pathway [96], on which cDC depend for induction of IFN [97]. In contrast, in pDC CSFV will induce IFN-( production [57]. As mentioned above, these cells do not rely on IRF-3 due to their high levels of constitutive IRF-7 [13]. The production of large quantities of IFN-( in the serum of CSFV-infected pigs [98], [99] presumably originating from pDC [99] indicates the importance of pDC for systemic IFN-( responses, particularly when cDC activities are impaired by the pathogen. In fact, a number of RNA viruses encode proteins interfering with cellular antiviral machinery and therefore prevent activation of cDC [100].",

Use of inactivated virus and subunit structures has demonstrated that this activation is independent of viral nucleic acid [106], excluding a role for TLR3 and TLR7. Moreover, mutation of the glycosylation site in the M protein yields a virus incapable of inducing pDC, but still capable of replication [107]. Also studies in our own laboratory support the conclusion of triggering through a cell surface receptor-inhibitors of endosomal acidification such as chloroquine and bafilomycin prevent CpG-induction, but not TGEV-induction of IFNa production by pDC [63].

Nonenveloped viruses such as FMDV-an RNA virus of the Picornaviridae related to poliovirus and rhinoviruses\u2014are less efficient to activate pDC. It should be noted that these viruses either fail to replicate in DC, or produce only an abortive infection [109], [110], [111]. Nevertheless, pDC can be efficiently activated by FMDV under particular conditions. In the presence of opsonizing factors such as virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig), which mediate FcgRII-enhanced uptake of virions, pDC activation was observed-an event dependent on the presence of intact and active viral RNA [63]. Such an activity would provide important antiviral innate defences at a time early post-vaccination when the adaptive response had begun producing specific antibody, but is inadequate to protect the host from disease or virus replication. This function of pDC would have an additional advantageassisting cDC in promoting the development of an efficacious adaptive immune defence for protecting the host. FMDV can also infect cDC including skin DC and MoDC [109], [112], which results in low levels if IFN-\u03b2 secretion.",

On the other side, T lymphocytes provide important signals to DC. With porcine MoDC cultures we have observed that after the co-culture of cytokine-matured DC with T cells in the presence of antigens, a further upregulation of MHC class II expression was obtained reaching levels clearly above those obtained with any stimuli in the absence of Tcells [64]. Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 pre-treatment of the DC was as efficient as TNF-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b1 cocktails to sensitize the DC for this process. These in vitro observations indicate that MoDC maturation is a regulated multistep process. From a practical point of view this means that although TNF-\u03b1 alone is not sufficient to induce MoDC maturation, the T-cell responses induced by TNF-\u03b1-treated DC can compensate to provide stimuli reaching those obtained with more potent maturation cocktails such as TNF-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b1 or TLR ligands [64].

For example, the Th1/Th2 profile will be influenced by the type of antigen presented as well as by the cytokine environment [88]. Another example of such modulation is the observation that cholera toxin-treated DC have the capacity to suppress T-cell proliferation [34]. This was associated with decreased MHC class II expression and increased IL-10 secretion of the DC and was reversible by addition of TNF-\u03b1 suggesting an immunoregulatory process. PRRSV has also been described by several authors to modulate DC and monocytes towards reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity after in vitro infection [102], [103]. Also here reduced expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules together with increased IL-10 levels have been described [101], [102], [103], [115]. Such studies are valuable to understand viral pathogenesis but care must be taken to avoid any contamination of the cultures with mycoplasma as MoDC cultures apparently efficiently support mycoplasma growth, which can result in a potent antiproliferative activity [116].",

In this sense, B cells should show only an indirect requirement for APC such as cDC. Nevertheless, APC produce a number of cytokines, which have a direct stimulatory effect on B cells. These are classical cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-(/\u03b2, but also more recently identified cytokines such as the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL)-members of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily [9]. In addition, several studies also demonstrated the \u201cdelivery\u201d of native unprocessed antigen by DC to B cells [5], [6], [7]. Our own studies with porcine DC in an in vitro model of FMDV-specific Ig synthesis demonstrated an important direct role of APC's during antigen-specific restimulation of immune B lymphocytes. Purified B cells produced virusspecific Ig only in the presence of Tcells and APC. Monocytes and MoDC but not pDC supported B-cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells. While IL-2 could replace T-cells, addition of BAFF could compensate for a lack of APC. In fact, blocking of BAFF receptor abrogated the APC-derived help for B-cell responses [41]. In addition, DC also influence isotype switching. As mentioned above, RA-treated MoDC promote virus-specific IgA secretion in vitro\n[75].",

An important role is certainly played by the \u201cm\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\u201d of FcR expressed on DC, antibody and antigen. This permits an amplification of antigen uptake and presentation, and can also mediate efficient cross-presentation of antigen for stimulation of MHC class I-restricted T-cell responses. Furthermore, the FcR-system sensitizes DC for inflammatory and antiviral cytokine responses. One example is the response of pDC to FMDV mentioned above (Table 4). These pDC only respond by producing IFN-( to FMDV when the virus is complexed with antibodies [63]. Another example is with CSFV, where pDC sensitized with cytophilic antibodies show enhanced IFN-( production in response to lower virus quantities than when no cytophilic antibodies are present [57]. In both cases FcgRII is involved.",

Although the library of reagents for such studies is still restricted compared to that for mouse and human studies, knowledge of porcine immunology is well advanced. With the unveiling of the sequence for the porcine genome, there will be clear advantages for using the pig. In particular, the MoDC model has a number of advantages and applicability. Large numbers of DC can be generated without killing the animal. For example, a typical figure of 30\u201370 million DC can be generated using monocytes isolated from 400 ml of blood. The facility to repeat blood sampling with the pig enables the use of these DC in antigen presentation assays, to monitor autologous T-cell responses in immunization experiments with outbred animals [113]. Moreover, with the MoDC being in an immature state, another advantage is the possibility to study DC maturation in response to cytokines, TLR ligands and infections.",

This approach allows us the much sought ability of studying DC migrating from peripheral sites over periods of several days [47], [56], a procedure not possible with humans and certainly cumbersome with mice considering their size and the quantities of material obtained. Moreover, the pig is more closely related to the human\u2014both genetically and physiologically\u2014when compared to mice. This is reflected by immunological similarities such as the PRR and their cellular distributions [58], [59]. Finally, the advantages which porcine immunology has to offer have gained a further boost with the advent of novel technologies such as RNA interference (RNAi) [38], which can be combined with the generation of transgenic pigs [117].",
