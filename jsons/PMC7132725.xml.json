Because of this, hospital surge capacity (having adequate resources for managing a sudden, unexpected increase in patients requiring acute medical care) and surge capability (having adequate specialized resources to treat specific patient groups, such as burned or highly contagious patients) must be addressed.4 The first step in this process is to assess U.S. hospitals' preparedness for infectious disease emergencies and current surge capacity and capability. This will identify gaps that hospitals can begin to address to become better prepared for an infectious disease emergency.

Braun and colleagues7 examined a national sample of hospitals undergoing Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations accreditation survey and used a variety of hospital preparedness indicators. Most recently, Trust For America's Health (TFAH) conducted a national survey of infection control professionals (ICP) representing U.S. hospitals in 2005 to examine infectious disease emergency preparedness.8 All of the previously published studies provide a broad view of hospital preparedness and discuss readiness indicators in relation to whether a hospital has a plan for surge capacity issues. Rarely are the hospital readiness indicators quantified in relation to the number/amount of beds and equipment available for disaster response. In addition, previously published studies have grouped hospital preparedness by region,5 state,6, 8 or as an aggregate sample.7 No published articles report hospital preparedness in relation to bed size.",

It was hypothesized that larger-sized hospitals (in terms of the number of beds in a facility, as reported by the ICP) would report the ability to care for a larger influx of patients more readily than would smaller-sized hospitals. It also was hypothesized that most U.S. hospitals do not have the surge capacity needed to care for an influx of potentially infectious patients in terms of staff to care for the patients or medical equipment/supplies needed.",

This may be a reflection of the general shortage of health care providers that not only affects routine patient care, but also disaster planning. Smaller-sized hospitals report less health care worker surge capacity than do larger facilities, which is logical given that smaller hospitals have fewer staff from which to draw during a disaster. It is critical, however, that hospitals of all sizes continue to develop plans for obtaining extra staff to respond during an infectious disease emergency, because this will affect a hospital's ability to care for patients. One way to accomplish this is for hospitals to include provisions for health care worker incentives to encourage them to come to work during an infectious disease emergency, something that less than half of U.S. hospitals report including in their disaster plan.",

Another unique finding from this study is that smaller-sized hospitals have less negative pressure surge capacity and are less likely to have developed plans for the rapid set-up of negative pressure than are larger-sized hospitals. Local/regional planning efforts that aim to spread out the burden of potentially contagious patients among several hospitals by way of a coalition or in nearby facilities may aid smaller-sized hospitals in handling an infectious disease outbreak. A bioterrorism attack or outbreak of an emerging infection involving an agent that is transmitted by way of the airborne route would require the use of negative pressure rooms and would be expected to exceed hospitals' current capacity to house potentially contagious patients. It is important that U.S. hospitals of all sizes continue to develop plans for negative pressure surge capacity.",

Almost all ICPs report that their hospital cannot accommodate an influx of any patients who require mechanical ventilation or that their facility can handle fewer than 10 such patients. Smaller-sized hospitals have less ventilator surge capacity than do larger-sized hospitals; this is likely related to the decreased ability of many small hospitals to provide large volume intensive care. Many potential bioterrorism agents and emerging infections cause diseases that result in severe respiratory distress or failure that would require prolonged intensive care for patients, including the use of mechanical ventilation. Without ventilator surge capacity, patient care could be compromised severely and result in increased morbidity and mortality. Most U.S. hospitals also report a lack of NIOSH-approved respirators, and half do not have sufficient numbers of surgical masks to handle a 3-day influx of patients. Although ventilators, respirators, and masks will have some availability through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic National Stockpile, there will be a delay before such resources are made available at the local level and the amount available might not meet the demand. The U.S. hospitals need to plan for surge capacity for ventilators, respiratory protection equipment, and other essential medical supplies until federal resources are made available. If not, significant ongoing discussion regarding altering or adjusting standards of care should become a more predominant theme.",

Smaller-sized hospitals have less surge capacity than do larger-sized hospitals in relation to health care worker and medical equipment/supplies surge capacity, however. In addition, this study indicates that Midwest hospitals are less likely than are those in the West or Northeast to have plans for negative pressure surge capacity, and have less ventilator surge capacity. Hospitals in the South are less likely to have plans/provisions for health care worker incentives.

Characteristics of the non-responders or their facility could not be assessed directly, which is a common issue in survey research. It also is possible that some respondents provided information about the same hospital, which may decrease data validity and reduce sample size. There was a higher than expected response rate from ICPs in Northeastern hospitals and those in larger-sized facilities based on the American Hospital Association hospital demographics.9 This likely is due to the increased interest and awareness surrounding infectious disease emergency preparedness in the Northeast (due to the 2001 terrorist events) and in larger-sized hospitals (due to the employment of more ICPs which leads to oversampling and the possible perception that these facilities will bear the largest responsibility for treating victims). Another limitation is that all ICPs were invited to participate in this survey, regardless of whether they were a member of their hospital's disaster planning committee or had any knowledge of their facility's disaster plan. The answer option, \u201cI don't know,\u201d was chosen a fair amount of the time. It is not known whether the survey question items assess issues that hospital disaster planning committees are not addressing or whether the ICP who answered the survey was not a member of their disaster planning committee or was not familiar with the details of their facility's surge capacity plan. If multiple ICPs in a given hospital are collectively unfamiliar with the emergency response plans for their facility, this could indicate a further area of concern.",
