Recent studies showed that \u02dc9% of community-acquired pneumonia in Europe is associated with the infection of influenza viruses [2]. Moreover, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus can cause hospital infection, resulting in death in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit [3]. Influenza A/H1N1/pdm 2009 and influenza B viruses may co-infect patients during the epidemic season [4]. Thus, influenza A/H1N1 virus infection is still a significant health problem with significant morbidity and mortality.",

Thus, early differentiation of severe form of influenza A/H1N1 infection from mild or moderate infection plays a critical role in the determination of treatment strategy for influenza A/H1N1 patients.",

However, the assay is not routinely available in health resource limited regions. Even in hospitals with routine screening for influenza A/H1N1 virus RNA, it still takes at least one or two days to get the results. Previous observations showed that white blood cell counts and differentials, a quick, routine laboratory test, may be useful to early define the severe illness caused by influenza A viruses, as lymphopenia occurred in the majority of severe form of influenza A/H1N1 infection [1,[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. However, these data were mainly from developed countries; whether the clinical use of lymphopenia as a clue to define severe influenza is globally applicable remains further study. In addition, data on the dynamic change of lymphocyte counts during the course of severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 have been rarely reported.",

Since this study included pregnant women and the total white blood cell counts are usually increased because of the elevation of neutrophils during pregnancy, leading to the relatively decreased proportion of lymphocytes. Therefore, lymphopenia was defined when absolute lymphocyte counts were <0.8 \u00d7 109/L, which was set up by the calculation of 20% \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 109)/L, in which 20% represents the lower normal limit of lymphocyte proportion of the whole white blood cells and (4 \u00d7 109)/L represents the normal lower limit of white blood cell counts.",

Therefore, in managing patients with fever and flu-like symptoms, routine blood tests, including white blood cell counts and differentials, should be performed. When the absolute lymphocyte counts are significantly reduced (<0.8 \u00d7 109/L), this should alert to the possibility of severe influenza infection and trigger the early implementation of appropriate treatment regimen, particularly in the season of influenza A. Meanwhile, further examinations including virologic tests and chest radiography should be performed in a timely manner, which will play an important role in early identifying and treating severe form of influenza A virus infection.",

She had normal peripheral lymphocyte counts (1.73 \u00d7 109/L) before 3 days the onset of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 infection, although the relative percentage (11.7%) of lymphocyte was decreased (Table 1), which may be attributed to the elevation of total white blood cells (14.8 \u00d7 109/L) and increased proportion (83.2%) of neutrophile granulocyte. The white blood cell counts became normal (5.8 \u00d7 109/L) after 2 days and the proportion of lymphocytes was normal (28.8%) one day before the onset of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 infection. Suspected hospital acquired infection in this patient had us possible to closely observe the longitudinal change of lymphocyte counts. On the first day of onset of infection, the patients presented with fever and flu-like symptoms and her blood cell counts showed normal total white blood cells (6.8 \u00d7 109/L), but significant decline of the proportion (8.7%) of lymphocytes and reduced absolute lymphocyte counts (0.59 \u00d7 109/L) (Table 1). The chest X-ray radiography showed the pneumonia in the lower lobe of right lung and diagnosis of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 infection was established on the 2nd day of illness based on the positivity of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 viral RNA. The patient received quick antiviral and comprehensive supportive treatment. As the health condition improved, the lymphocyte counts increased. The dynamic changes of lymphocyte counts in this patient demonstrate that the severe lymphopenia can occur at the very early stage, almost same as the onset of symptoms. The very early occurrence of lymphopenia is also validated by the findings in two other patients (patient nos. 15 and 18), in whom the severe lymphopenia was observed on the second day of the illness (Table 1).",

The infections characterized with non-pneumonia mainly include acquired immune deficiency syndrome caused by HIV infection, severe measles [22], West Nile encephalitis [23], Ebola virus infection [24], and disease caused by chikungunya virus [25]. The lymphopenia occurred in above diseases can be easily differentiated from that occurred in influenza A/H1N1 since these infections have their own clinical features. On the other hand, pulmonary infections caused by other pathogens with lymphopenia may mimic the clinical presentations of H1N1 influenza. These infections include severe acute respiratory syndrome [26,27], Legionnaires disease or human parainfluenza virus type 3, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus as well as other types of influenza A virus such as avian influenza A H5N6, H7N9 or H3N2 [[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome has been eradicated even since 2004; diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome is not considered when a patient is characterized by systematic toxemia and pneumonia and lymphopenia. The differentiation of influenza A/H1N1 from other pulmonary infections which mimic clinical presentations and lymphopenia can only be made by the isolation of specific pathogens by culture or molecular techniques or specific serologic assays, all of which are not easily accessible or cannot provide quick results for the differentiation at the early stage of the diseases. However, as the treatment of severe influenza A/H1N1 and pneumonia caused by avian influenza A viruses is almost same, lymphopenia in a patient with influenza like illness, in combination with the pneumonia findings of chest radiograph, can serve as a clue to early define a severe pulmonary infection that requires urgent management before the availability of results of the specific laboratory tests.",

First, this study did not include laboratory-confirmed mild or moderate pandemic influenza A/H1N1 patients without pneumonia as a control group, because such patients were not hospitalized in our hospital. This had us impossible to compare the incidence of lymphopenia between the mild or moderate and severe infection, since lymphopenia can also occur in non-severe influenza A patients [1,8,9]. Second, severe influenza A/H1N1 infection has other laboratory abnormalities such as partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide [9], which were not presented in details in the present study. Third, because lymphopenia can also be observed in other non-infectious and infectious diseases as mentioned above, it is impossible to set up a cutoff value to distinguish lymphopenia in severe influenza A/H1N1 infection from that in other diseases. Thus, lymphopenia cannot be used alone to define severe influenza A/H1N1 infection; it should be used in the combination of typical clinical presentations. Even though, it still has the potential to exaggerate the severity of illness. However, compared with the delayed identification of severe influenza A infection, which may delay the necessary therapies, we consider that the risk associated with delayed diagnosis and treatment exceeds that of over-diagnosis of the severe infection.",

In the conventional viral infection, the proportion of lymphocytes in the circulation is usually increased. However, we showed that most patients with severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 had marked lymphopenia (Table 1). The lymphopenia might be resulted from the redistribution and migration of lymphocytes to respiratory system to combat against the virus. A report showed that infiltrated cells in the lung of a patient died of influenza A/H1N1 were predominantly lymphocytes [34]. This observation supports the hypothesis of the redistribution of lymphocytes. The recovery of lymphocytes in the circulation during the second and third weeks after the illness onset (Table 1) indicates that the lymphocytes re-enter the circulation from inflamed tissues. Additionally, lymphopenia may also be associated with apoptosis induced by viral infection [26].",
