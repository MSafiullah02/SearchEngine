The accompanying editorial, \"A guide for a brave future for lung ventilation/perfusion tomography: the most important pulmonary nuclear medicine technique\" [8] , also acknowledges that the technique for V/P SPECT has remained largely stable, but notes the development of cameras and software for V/P SPECT . Both the updated guideline and the editorial seem to overlook improvements that have evolved with nebulizers, which have produced smaller size droplets than older nebulizers. The value of using the best available nebulizer to reduce central deposition and hot spots which may limit interpretation was recognized in the previous guideline [2] . One equipment manufacturer, for example, has described a nebulizer which produces droplets with a median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) as small as 0.28 mcm [9] .",

If interfering particle deposition occurs, consider additional diagnostic options\" [10] . According to the updated guideline, hotspots with 99m Tc-labeled carbon particles are seen in some patients with severe airway obstruction [1] . Also, in describing pitfalls in image interpretation of V/P SPECT , the updated guideline comments that on rare occasions in patients with emphysema 99m Tc-labeled carbon particles are trapped in bullae in which perfusion is absent. This causes a pattern that may be mistaken for a mismatch [1] . Further, the updated guideline observes uneven aerosol distribution and reduced 99m Tc-labeled carbon particles penetration in grade 2 COPD patients as well as impaired 99m Tc-labeled carbon particles penetration to the periphery and a central deposition in large airways, usually with large areas of reduced/absent ventilation in grade 3 COPD patients [1] .",

This choice of nomenclature in the published updated guideline is surprising and appears counter to the instructions to authors for submitting publications to many biomedical journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, and the Journal of Nuclear Medicine [11, 12] , which generally recommend the use of generic names. The instructions for these journals, for example, recommend that the generic name should be used throughout a publication. When a proprietary name is used, the proprietary (brand) name (including the manufacturer) generally should be mentioned only once following the first use of the generic name.",
