Thus, 3-deazaadenosine, a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and an attractive target for the design of antiviral drugs, has shown significant activity against HSV-1, HIV and oncogenic DNA viruses [4]. 3-Deazaadenine derivatives of cyclopentyl adenine drugs aristeromycin and neoplanocin A retained their strong activity against HSV-1, vaccinia virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) with lower cytotoxicity [5], [6], [7], [8]. Also, 3-deazaguanosine has shown a wide spectrum of activity against DNA and RNA viruses as well as antitumoural activity [1]. C-2 and C-3 halogenated 3-deazapurine derivatives showed anti-HBV activity, a broad spectrum of antitumour properties [9] and strong ability of subtracting Mycobacterium tuberculosis adenosine kinase [4]. C-7 fluorinated and C-2\u2032 methylated derivatives of the naturally isolated antibiotic tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) have shown strong inhibition of NS5B, a nonstructural hepatitis C protein, while C-7 halogenated also exhibited substantial activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [10], [11], [12]. Acyclic derivatives of sangivamycin (7-deazapurine broad spectrum antibiotic) showed the same antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HCMV as the reference drug ganciclovir, without cytotoxic effects. In addition, compound BMK-Y101 and its prodrug are preclinical candidates for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [12]. Furthermore, C-2 fluorinated, C-7 alkylated and 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy derivatives of 9-deazaadenosine have shown a broad spectrum of antitumoural activities with lower cytotoxicity in relation to 9-deazaadenosine [13], [14].",

Condensation reaction in situ of silylated 3-deazapurine bases (A, B and C) and 5,6-di-O-acetyl-2,3-di-O-benzyl-l-ascorbic acid (dAdBAA, synthesized as previously described [15]) with Friedel\u2013Crafts catalyst, trimethylsilyltrifluoromethane sulphonate (TMSOTf) afforded the new 3-deazapurine derivatives of l-ascorbic acid (1\u20134, Scheme 1) containing ethylenic spacer between two moieties. 2,6-Difluoro-3-chloro-3-deazapurine base (B) was synthesized in six steps as previously described by Liu, M.-C. et al. [9] while 3-bromo-3-deazapurine base (A) was synthesized by cyclization reaction of 3,4-diamino-5-bromopyridine with diethoxymethyl acetate (DEMA). 3-Bromo-3-deazapurine derivative of l-AA (1) was isolated as N-9 regioisomer and as a mixture of Z and E isomers in the ratio 4:1, while reaction between 3-deazapurine base B and dAdBAA resulted in two regioisomers, N-9 as a Z isomer (2) and N-7 as a mixture of Z and E isomers (3) in the ratio 3:1. 6-Chloro-3-deazapurine derivative of l-AA (4) was isolated as N-7 regioisomer in equal Z and E isomer amounts. Ammonolysis of compounds 1, 2 and 4 in dioxane and methanol gave compounds 5\u20137, bearing a hydroxy group at the C-4 of now imino-l-ascorbic acid (imino-l-AA). Also, substitution of the fluorine atom with amino group at the C-6 position of the 3-deazapurine base occurred in the synthesis of 3-deazapurine derivative of imino-l-AA (7). Compound 4 underwent debenzylation with boron-trichloride (1 M in dichloromethane) which yielded the compound 8, 3-deazapurine derivative of l-AA with free hydroxy groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions of l-AA, as mixture of Z and E isomers in the ratio 10:1.",

Condensation reaction of 7-deazapurine base (7-DP) D and dAdBAA in Vorbr\u00fcggen reaction conditions gave N-1 regioisomer of compound 9 (Z:E = 3:1) (Scheme 2\n). 6-Chloro-7-iodo-7-deazapurine derivative of l-AA (10) was not isolated under Vorbr\u00fcggen conditions, but was successfully obtained via reaction under Mitsunobu reaction conditions. Reaction between 7-deazapurine base E and 6-hydroxy-2,3-di-O-benzyl-4,5-didehydro-l-ascorbic acid (HdBAA) with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afforded compound 10, 6-chloro-7-iodo-7-deazapurine substituted with 4,5-didehydro-5,6-dideoxy-l-ascorbic acid at N-9 position in the isomer ratio Z:E = 9:1 (Scheme 2). Ammonolysis of compounds 9 and 10 in similar procedures as for the synthesis of 3-deazapurine derivatives of imino-l-AA (5\u20137) gave 7-deazapurine derivatives of imino-l-AA 11 and 12, bearing the amino group at the C-4 chiral position of the lactame moiety (Scheme 2). As opposed to the structure of analogue derivatives of deazapurines and imino-l-AA described in this paper (5\u20137, 11 and 16\u201319) which contain ethyl spacer between deazapurine and lactame moieties, compound 12 contains ethylenic spacer between those two moieties with the double bond between C-5 and C-6 atoms. Structural difference of the products 11 and 12 may be explained by the mechanism from which these lactams arise. The mechanism of the formation of the lactams from l-ascorbic acid involves nucleophilic attack of the ammonia to the carbonyl group at C-1 of the lactone moiety with concomitant lactone ring opening and formation of the keto-enolic tautomers that subsequently close to form lactams [24]. Thus, our findings of the two structural different compounds 11 and 12 may be in accordance to that mechanism; the keto tautomer undergoes the nucleophilic attack of the amino group, followed by ring closure and formation of the lactame derivative 11, whereas the enolic tautomer undergoes the same nucleophilic attack followed by a consecutive shift of the double bond and formation of imino-l-AA derivative 12.",

Also, compound 3 did not show any cytostatic effects on normal human embryonal lung (HEL) cells, embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3) nor against immortalized cells, i.e. cervical carcinoma (HeLa), Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK). However, removal of benzyl protection groups at C-2 and C-3 positions of l-AA moiety as in compound 8 and conversion of l-AA into imino-l-AA as in analogue 7, resulted in loss of anti-HCMV activity. Compound 3 and its N-9 regioisomer (2) have exhibited comparable effects against Punta Toro virus, but concomitantly showed cytostatic effects on the monkey cell line Vero. In addition, compound 2 exerted moderate activity against Coxsackie B4 virus in Vero cells and no cytostatic effects on cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) used in the antiviral assays. The 7-deazapurine derivatives of l-AA (9, 10) and of imino-l-AA (12) showed no marked cytostatic nor antiviral activities. In contrast, the 9-deazapurine derivatives of l-ascorbic acid (13, 15) and of imino-l-ascorbic acid (18) exhibited marked effects against the murine leukemia cell line (L1210/0) at micromolar concentrations (IC50), while the 2,6-dimethoxy-9-deazapurine and l-ascorbic acid derivative (13) also displayed effects against CEM/0 cells. In addition, the 9-deazahypoxanthine derivative disubstituted with two l-ascorbic acid moieties (15) had strong activity against HeLa cells. Conversion of l-ascorbic acid moiety of compound 15 into imino-l-ascorbic acid, resulted in gaining compound 18 which showed activity against the pancreatic carcinoma cell line (MiaPaCa-2). The 9-deazapurine derivatives 13, 15 and 18 did not shown any cytotoxic effects on embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3). Furthermore, the 9-deazahypoxanthine derivative disubstituted with two l-AA moieties at N-1 and N-7 positions (15) exhibited even stronger activity against Punta Toro virus than compounds 2 and 3, with 3- and 22-folds lower EC50's than dexstran-sulphate (DS-10000) and ribavirin, respectively.

The antiviral assays, other than HIV, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (5-fold compound dilutions) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (\u223c3 \u00d7 105 cells/cm3) cells were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200 \u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds.

After 72 h of incubation, the cell growth rate was evaluated by performing the MTT assay: experimentally determined absorbance values were transformed into a cell percentage growth (PG) using the formulas proposed by NIH and described previously [25].
