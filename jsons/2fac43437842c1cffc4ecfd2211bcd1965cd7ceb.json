Effectiveness to others for mask usage is based on the protection factor of a mask type. It is the protection provided to people in contact with a sick individual wearing a mask. Effectiveness to self is based on the penetration level of a mask type. It is the protection provided to a healthy individual when in close contact with an infectious person.

Since N95 respirators were not designed for use by children, the adults only scenario is more realistic; however the all age groups scenario allows us to understand the importance of children wearing masks and the use of a more protective mask.
