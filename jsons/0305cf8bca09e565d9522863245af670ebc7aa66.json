The LIAISON \u00ae SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was designed 28 to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 proteins in a standardized 29 automated chemiluminescent assay.

DiaSorin has developed an automated serology based assay for 50 the measurement of IgG specific to SARS CoV-2 Spike protein, and tested its clinical 51 performance in collaboration with Italian health care professionals who provided access 52 to large numbers of samples from infected and non-infected individuals. The assay 53 delivers excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is able to identify samples with high 54 levels of neutralizing antibodies. This will provide guidance in assessing the true 55 immune status of subjects, as well as meeting the pressing need to screen donors for 56 high titer convalescent sera for subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic use. 57 58 SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, has spread at an 59 alarming rate since the first case tracked back to mid-November of 2019 in Wuhan 60 China (1). Contraction and subsequent transmission accrues most prevalently from 61 community exposure, non-human exposure, or amongst relatives living in proximity to 62 symptomatic or asymptomatic infected individuals. Due to the lack of readily available 63 diagnostics, inferior means of infection control, or the inability to triage and isolate both 64 acute and suspected cases consequent to space limitations, the Covid-19 pandemic, in 65 placing increasingly excessive demands on the global healthcare network, has unveiled 66 a number of critical limitations (2). 67 No safe vaccines have been developed for SARS-CoV infections to date, and the 68 lack of currently available effective antiviral therapies, in spite of years of ongoing 69 research, are certainly hampering efforts to combat this pandemic. In addition, the 70 current molecular-based diagnostic tools utilized to diagnose infection, though serving 71 adequately as the only means available, are not suitable for mass screening, and 72 though many serological assays have been developed, no scientific data are available 73 to authenticate their effectiveness.

Serology tests are now being utilized to gain an initial assessment of infection 237 prevalence with reported numbers of ~20% and ~3% from New York and California, 238 respectively (19). In California, a negative test with the LIAISON assay would have an 239 accompanying NPV of >99.5%, and in NYC a NPV of >97.5%, regardless of cut-off, 240 indicating that staying at home and avoiding exposures would be the best PPV of 80% derived from the higher cut-off, though overall less sensitive, would provide 243 a positive test result, affording more confidence of the subject's true positivity, while the 244 lower cut-off would present some ambiguity as regards any subject's real level of 245 protection (PPV of 62%). In New York, however, regardless of the cut-off, the PPV of 246 89-95% affords a much greater degree of confidence that an individual would have 247 protective levels of antibody. When testing in a hospital setting, the lower cut-off may be 248 preferable to ensure a higher NPV, even though the overall specificity may be 249 decreased.",
