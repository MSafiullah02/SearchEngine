The types of infections that occur in patients with PID diseases are dictated largely by the nature of the immunodeficiency, which can be defined by dysfunction of cellular or humoral defenses. An increasing number of PID diseases, including those with both cellular and humoral defects, have antibody deficiency as a major feature, and as a result can benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In fact, the most common PID diseases worldwide are antibody deficiencies and include common variable immunodeficiency, congenital agammaglobulinemia, hyper-IgM syndrome, specific antibody deficiency, and Good syndrome. Although immunoglobulin replacement therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of these conditions, a thorough understanding of the specific infections for which these patients are at increased risk can hasten diagnosis and guide additional therapies. Moreover, the infection trends in some patients with PID disease who have profound defects of cellular immunity, such as autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (Job/Buckley syndrome) or dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, suggest that select patients might benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy even if their immunodeficiency is not limited to antibody defects. In this review, we provide an overview of the predisposition to infections seen in PID disease that may benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy. W ith the ever-increasing sophistication of diagnostic tools, more than 300 distinct primary immunodeficiency (PID) diseases are now recognized. 1 clinical and immunologic characteristics that confer susceptibility to specific infectious processes. The most common PID diseases worldwide are predominately those that involve antibody deficiencies, 2 which include common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), congenital agammaglobulinemia, hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM), specific antibody deficiency, and Good syndrome. Many patients with these conditions require immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy to prevent life-threatening infections and related chronic complications. This is also true of patients with immune defects that extend beyond the humoral compartment, such as many with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), even after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or those with autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) and dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency. Thus, many more patients than those with selective antibody deficiencies may benefit from Ig replacement therapy. In this review, we characterize the predisposition to specific infections conferred by PID diseases in which antibody deficiency is a prominent component, with the goal of hastening diagnosis and guiding the use of Ig replacement therapy for these highly vulnerable patients (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1713, "end": 1714, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2952, "end": 2961, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Common variable immunodeficiency (or CVID) is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency and is characterized by profound antibody dysfunction. 3 This diagnosis represents a heterogeneous group of genetic etiologies all characterized by the shared phenotype of reduced serum levels of IgG, low IgA and/or IgM, and impaired antibody response to vaccination. B-cell numbers are typically present at low or normal levels, whereas CD4 T-cell numbers may be decreased in some patients. 4 CVID is believed to result from the absence of B-cell maturation into long-lived isotype-switched memory B cells and plasma cells due to a variety of potential mechanisms that are poorly understood. Many patients with CVID experience heightened susceptibility to both infections and autoimmune and inflammatory complications (e.g., autoimmune cytopenia, enteropathy, and lung disease). 5 Notably, patients with CVID with the lowest levels of isotype-switched memory B cells (CD27 + IgD\u2212 IgM\u2212) have been reported to have the greatest risk of these complications. 6 Because antibody deficiency is the prominent feature of CVID, Ig replacement therapy is the standard of care, although this treatment does not seem to alter the course of autoimmune and inflammatory complications in many patients. 5 The most common infections in patients with CVID involve the respiratory tract, reported in 84% in one large study, with bronchitis and sinusitis the most frequent manifestations and pneumonia also occurring in more than half of patients. 7 Recurrent sinopulmonary infections in patients with CVID are typically caused by encapsulated organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) 8 or viral pathogens such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and influenza virus. 9 When pulmonary infections are severe and recurrent, patients may develop irreversible lung damage such as bronchiectasis, which occurs in one-third or more of patients. 7, 10, 11 Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma are under recognized causes of infections in these patients and may involve atypical locations such as the joints. Notably, Ig replacement therapy has been shown to reduce the incidence of pneumonia, the onset of bronchiectasis, and other severe respiratory tract infections in CVID, although its role in limiting sinusitis is less clear. [12] [13] [14] In CVID patients with bronchiectasis, chronic pulmonary symptoms and recurrent infections may persist despite standard Ig replacement. 15, 16 In these patients, there may be benefit in aiming for higher IgG troughs or steady-state levels, and a decrease in pneumonia has been observed for every 100 mg/dL increment increase in IgG trough level up to 1000 mg/dL. 14, 17 Higher IgG trough levels can be achieved through either more frequent Ig replacement dosing or administration of higher doses per treatment.

Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma infections can cause pneumonia as well as destructive septic arthritis. 28 Patients with XLA are also susceptible to infections with Campylobacter and Helicobacter, which can be responsible for cellulitis, ulcers of the lower extremities, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis in addition to GI infections. 29, 30 In the setting of transient neutropenia, patients with XLA can present with Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus sepsis. 31 Prophylactic antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), may be particularly useful in preventing infections during bouts of neutropenia.

In fact, PJP pneumonia is the presenting manifestation of hyper-IgM syndrome in almost half of diagnosed patients. 39 This association with PJP pneumonia is likely due to the role of CD40L in T-cell effector function, including activation of macrophages and other immune cells to kill intracellular pathogens, and thus such patients effectively have a combined (B-and T-cell) immunodeficiency.

[68] [69] [70] [71] Before the identification of the molecular defect, many patients with variants in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 gene (or DOCK8) were categorized as having autosomal-recessive HIES. 72 It should be noted that many of the DOCK8-related family members activate Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (RAC) family members and CDC42 to initiate actin reorganization, which plays a crucial role in many immune processes, such as phagocytosis. 73 Patients with DOCK8 deficiency present with severe viral skin infections (warts, Molluscum contagiosum), severe atopic disease (food allergy, eczema), recurrent S. aureus skin infections, and pneumonias. 72, 74, 75 These patients may also have an increased risk of malignancy, in particular, lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma. 72 The key laboratory findings include a decrease in numbers of T and B cells, elevated IgE levels, and eosinophilia. The main treatment for patients with DOCK8 deficiency is HSCT. 76 Before undergoing stem cell transplantation, patients with DOCK8 deficiency should be treated with Ig replacement therapy as well as prophylactic TMP-SMX to decrease the risk of lung and skin infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 167, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 333, "end": 337, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 338, "end": 342, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 343, "end": 347, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 428, "end": 430, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 694, "end": 696, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 904, "end": 906, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1273, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1276, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1314, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1518, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1523, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1528, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1533, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1718, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1976, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2184, "text": "72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2188, "text": "74,", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2191, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2307, "end": 2309, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2490, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1190, "end": 1197, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Hyper-IgE syndrome"}, {"text": "The primary immunodeficiency treatment consortium has proposed formal diagnostic criteria for SCID. \"Typical\" or \"classic\" SCID is characterized by profound T-cell lymphopenia (CD3 T-cell count <300 cells/\u03bcL) together with a < 10% phytohemagglutinin (PHA) response compared to control values or identification of maternal T cells in the infant circulation. 42, 77, 78 Partial or \"leaky\" SCID, including Omenn syndrome, is diagnosed based on T-cell lymphopenia adjusted for age (age <2 years, <1000 cells/mm 3 ; age 2-4 years, <800 cells/mm 3 ; age >4 years, <600 cells/mm 3 ) and PHA response <30% of the control value. 79 Although B cells are present in many types of SCID (common gamma chain deficiency [IL2RG], JAK3 deficiency), antibody production is greatly impaired in the absence of adequate costimulation by CD4+ T cells. Patients with SCID often present with chronic respiratory infections, protracted diarrhea, and chronic candidiasis. Common pathogens include bacteria such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas; viruses such as parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and CMV; protozoa; and fungi such as PJP and Candida albicans. 80 All patients with SCID must be treated with prophylaxis for PJP as well as Ig replacement.
