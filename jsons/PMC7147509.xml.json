That businesses operate in the context of some larger system,\nnot a vacuum, is today part of the accepted business perspective. However, we ought to\nrecognize that scanning and the related processes of contingency planning presume our\nability to discern future patterns. Many well\u2010known business mistakes, such as the Big\nThree's disastrous handling of the energy crisis in the 1970s, can be attributed as much to\ninadequate managerial skills as ignorance about environmental trends. After all, it was not\nany existing predators that eradicated the dinosaurs, but instead it was something never\nbefore seen and hence could not have been anticipated. The fact that the meteor was not in\nthe dinosaur's vernacular did not prevent a meteor from changing the course of earth's\nhistory. The scope of our environmental scanning activities expands as our knowledge\nincreases. Such scanning is informed by new developments that have often been prospering\njust below the corporate radar screen.",

As devastating as it\nwas for many businesses, strategic planners would have to be psychic to have anticipated the\ndisease and to incorporate it in the planning process. However, it would be useful to\ndelineate lessons that can be learned from the recent SARS (and other) outbreaks, and\ndiscuss how strategic management may benefit from an appreciation of these lessons. In\npreparation for unforeseen external events organizations should have a plan in place to\nreduce the influence on the organization and provide an operation manual in the event of a\ncrisis. However, many Fortune 1,000 firms do not have a crisis\u2010management\nplan at all (Hickman and Crandall, 1997). As seen\nwith the SARS outbreak this lack of preparedness can have devastating effects on business\nand warrant inclusion in our business definition of a crisis. A crisis is defined as a low\nprobability/high consequence event, caused by human actions, that threatens the most\nfundamental goals of an organization (Weick, 1988).\nMitroff and Pearson (1993) categorized crises\naccording to two dimensions: normal to sever and technical/economic to human/social.\nHowever, their crisis analysis included only industrial health problems, not epidemics.\nThere is a need to broaden the scope of crisis to include epidemics. Our paper aims to\nprovide this addition.",

Given the substantial growth in these economies, it is not surprising that\nthe US Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration recently predicted that\nthe greatest commercial opportunities will be found in the Big Emerging Markets such as The\nPeople's Republic of China (China), India, Singapore, Mexico, Vietnam, or South Africa\n(Qureshi, 1996). China provides perhaps the\nclearest illustration. For example, in 2002 China received $52 billion in direct foreign\ninvestment, overtaking the United States to make it the world's biggest recipient of direct\nforeign investment (Buckman, 2003). According to the\nUS Bureau of Economic Analysis in 2002, China and Hong Kong accounted for nearly a quarter\nof the income of US overseas subsidiaries (Karmin,\n2003). However, the recent SARS outbreak has shown how quickly commerce can be\nimpacted in the global market. According to Richard Miller, an economist and vice president\nof the World Travel & Tourism Council: \u201cNever before has there been a massive impact of\nthis nature other than a war shutting down an economy totally\u201d (Prystay, 2003). As of June 20, 2003, outbreaks of SARS have occurred in\n32 countries, resulting in 8,461 individuals being infected and 804 subsequent deaths (World Health Organization, 2003).",

In the Chinese province\nof Guangdong, the place where SARS is believed to have started, the country's largest\nexport\u2010trade fair saw orders drop in April nearly 50 percent (Leggett, 2003). In Beijing, draconian measures were imposed to try to\nstem the spread of SARS. Public schools and universities were closed, migrant workers were\ntold to stay in the capital and make\u2010shift roadblocks were set up in villages to prevent\ncity dwellers from entering (Kaufman and Chen, 2003).\nIn May, Hong Kong retail sales were down 80 to 90 percent, restaurants and their suppliers\nwere going broke and hotel occupancy rates were in the single digits. Airlines were also\nseverely impacted. Cathay Pacific Airway during this time dealt with an 87 percent decrease\nin air traffic from a year earlier (Meredith, 2003).\nSuch a decrease in travel is not surprising given the overall drop in business air travel\nglobally. In a survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management in the USA,\nbased on 423 human resource professionals, 20 percent reported cuts in employee travel as a\nresult of SARS (USA Today, 2003).\nKingsway International Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong investment holding company that engages\nin securities brokerage, corporate finance advisory services, fund and asset management,\nsecurities investments, and strategic investment in technology\u2010related businesses has seen\nearning per share drop from $0.44 in June 2002 to $0.002 in June 2003.

Westpac\nBank has predicted that SARS could reduce Australia's economic growth by 0.3 percent (Chong, 2003). Multinational corporations are also being\nimpacted. For example 3M, the makers of the N95 face mask, one of the few face masks that\nare 95 percent effective at filtering out airborne diseases like SARS, does 21 percent of\nits $16 billion in annual sales in the Asia Pacific region. J.P. Morgan lists 3M as well as\nIntel and United Technologies as American companies that could be hurt by SARS (Freedman, 2003). Other companies suggesting revenues will\nbe down as a result of SARS include American International Group Inc., Yum Brand Inc.,\nGoodrich Corp. (Karmin, 2003) and Cara Operations\nLtd. (Flavelle, 2003). Another industry feeling the\nimpact of SARS is the phone makers. Motorola, a company holding 14 percent of the Chinese\nmobile phone market, has warned that it may fall short of sales and profit forecasts for the\nsecond quarter and year end citing weakening demand in Asia because of SARS (Timmons, 2003). Four Season's Hotel Inc. has a net loss\nin the first quarter of 27 cents per share compared to net income of 22 cents per share a\nyear earlier (Infomart, 2003). SARS is seen as a key\ncontributor to this loss.

            "text": "While the above figures are indicators of the effect of SARS, the true impact may never be\nknown. It is believed that China, in order to maintain a semblance of stability and economic\nprosperity at the time of changing government leaders, covered up the truth about the extent\nof SARS. It went so far as to remove SARS patients from hospitals to deceive inspectors from\nthe World Health Organization (Jue, 2003). In April,\nJiang Yanyong blew the whistle on Chinese authorities\u2019 deceit regarding the truth about SARS\nin Beijing. In a letter to journalists, when Beijing was saying that only 12 people in the\ncity were infected with SARS, Dr Jiang disclosed that the true number of SARS patients was\nat least 100, including ten who had died. In response to Dr Jiang's revelation the health\nminister and Beijing mayor were fired. For a regime with a long history of deception and\ndenial, this event has been viewed as a revolution in official openness (York, 2003). In a step to reinforce openness the Chinese\ngovernment has threatened to execute anyone who knowingly spreads the SARS virus (Dean, 2003). However, this may have the reverse impact of\nmaking people hesitant to admit they have SARS for fear of punishment. By lying about the\ntrue number of SARS patients, Beijing damaged what little faith international economist has\nin its numbers. For example, repeated yearly claims of 8 percent annual GDP may be\nquestionable. For the new Chinese leadership the incentive to cheat is even greater than\nusual. Strong GDP growth has been the key to the Communist party's hold on power. The new\ngovernment would not want to be associated with instant economic failure (August, 2003).",

While SARS is taking the center stage, areas in Europe are\ndealing with another disturbing virus that is spreading among chickens and in some cases\nhumans. The Avian flu has been found in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The virus,\nwhich rarely causes serious illness in humans, infected 80 people who came in contact with\ninfected birds (Fuhrmans, 2003).

In fact, otherwise innocuous actions on the part of businesses have a hand in\nspreading the disease. For instance, truckers working for long\u2010distance transportation\ncompanies have been identified as a major transmitter of the disease throughout Africa and\nAsia. HIV/AIDS also has devastating effects on businesses themselves. Barclay's Bank of\nZambia, for example, reported losing more than a quarter of its senior managers to the\ndisease. A mattress company in Zimbabwe hires and trains three people for every position due\nto attrition by the disease (Forstater et al., 2002).\nAIDS has become South Africa's biggest single killer. In a 2001 South Africa's Medical\nResearch Council calculated that 40 percent of the deaths of those aged between 15 and 49 in\nthe previous year were due to the AIDS pandemic. In recognition of the impact HIV/AIDS is\nhaving on its work force, DaimlerChrysler South Africa has, since 1999, provided funding for\nstandardized treatment for HIV\u2010related diseases and anti\u2010retroviral medication for its\nemployees (DaimlerChrysler, 2003). According to the\nAfrican vice president of the World Bank, Callisto Madavo, HIV is the single greatest threat\nto future economic development in Africa. Of equal concern though is the growth rate of AIDS\nin Asia. AIDS is growing fastest in Asia leading many health experts to believe that it may\novertake Africa in the number of people infected with HIV. This will create a vexing problem\nfor investors in Europe and North America as their economies peak and they increasingly turn\nto the Third World for profits. Inexpensive labor is appealing but what if you cannot find\nemployees to complete an order (Jeter, 1999)?",
