            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a group 3 coronavirus, produces three proteins (IBV E, IBV 3a, and IBV 3b) from subgenomic mRNA 3 during infection. IBV E, a viral envelope protein, plays a role in virus budding, possibly by altering membrane morphology at the virus assembly site. In addition to this role, IBV E may also function as a viroporin, although no data from infected cells have confirmed this possibility definitively. Conversely, the IBV 3a and IBV 3b proteins are nonstructural proteins. These proteins are dispensable for replication in cell culture, but are thought to be important for infection of the natural host. This chapter details methods for generating and screening antibodies to these gene 3 proteins. Antibodies were raised in rabbits following inoculation with IBVspecific peptides and GST fusion proteins, and were screened by immunofluorescence, radioimmunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes (1). During infection, four structural proteins are expressed: spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and envelope (E). The viral envelope E protein is thought to alter membrane morphology at the virus assembly site, thus promoting virus budding (2-10). Additionally, more infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein is produced in infected cells than is incorporated into virions, suggesting that IBV E may have a function apart from its role in virus budding (3). Consistent C Humana Press, New York, NY 14,  with this idea, studies have indicated that the E protein from several coronaviruses may act as a viroporin (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, no conclusive experiments in infected cells have confirmed this possibility. In addition to the coronavirus structural proteins, several other open reading frames (ORFs) located between the structural protein ORFs produce proteins of undetermined function during infection (15) . These proteins are thought to be nonstructural, accessory proteins that are essential for productive virus infection in the natural host, but dispensable for virus growth in cell culture (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Therefore, study of these accessory proteins, in addition to study of the coronavirus structural proteins, may more fully elucidate pathogenesis mechanisms and lead to the development of more effective antiviral drugs.",

Both of these proteins are translated from subgenomic mRNA 3, with IBV 3a translation initiated via the first AUG, and the downstream IBV 3b translation initiated via leaky ribosomal scanning (25). Subgenomic mRNA 3 also produces the IBV E protein through an internal ribosomal entry site. We have developed antibodies specific to each of these IBV gene 3 proteins for use in characterization and functional studies. IBV E was found to localize to Golgi membranes via its C-terminal tail (3, 26) . IBV E also promoted the release of virus-like particles through the interaction of its C-terminal tail with the IBV M protein (27) . Studies on the IBV 3a protein demonstrated that one pool of IBV 3a localized cytoplasmically, while another pool associated with membranes at the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (28) . The short length of IBV 3a appeared to preclude efficient association with signal recognition particle (SRP), causing inefficient co-translational insertion of IBV 3a into membranes. Thus, IBV may limit 3a levels at smooth ER membranes by a novel mechanism.",

However, IBV 3b was undetectable via microscopy of IBV-infected or transiently transfected mammalian cells (29) . Surprisingly, IBV 3b, which was readily detected in chicken cells, localized to the cytoplasm with apparent nuclear exclusion. The half-life of IBV 3b was greatly reduced in mammalian cells as compared to chicken cells. This rapid turnover in mammalian cells was proteasome-dependent, whereas turnover in avian cells was proteasome-independent.

Samples are then heated for 5 min at 95 \u2022 C, until they are no longer viscous when the side of the tube is tapped. Samples are then subjected to SDS-PAGE (Section 3.13) and immunoblotting (Section 3.14). The primary antibodies used are a 1:1000 dilution of nonimmunized rabbit sera in the primary antibody dilution buffer. An example of the results produced from this protocol is shown in Fig. 3 . rabbit #2 rabbit #3 rabbit #4 Fig. 3 . Prescreening rabbit sera before injection of peptides or proteins.

Peptide purities greater than 90% can be obtained from commercial companies for an increased price. However, in our experience, 90%-pure peptides are sufficient for obtaining rabbit sera specific to the protein of interest. 9. If a peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of a protein is synthesized, then the extra cysteine should be added to the N-terminus of the peptide. On the other hand, if a peptide corresponding to the N-terminus of a protein is synthesized, then the extra cysteine should be added to the C-terminus of the peptide. 10. In our experience, ordering IBV 3a, IBV 3b, and IBV E peptides for injecting rabbits has been much more cost-and time-effective than expressing and purifying fusion proteins from bacteria. Expressing and purifying the IBV 3a and IBV 3b fusion proteins in bacteria have been very difficult, requiring optimization of many steps in the protocol listed in Section 3.2. Moreover, high yields of soluble IBV 3a fusion protein have not yet been obtained, likely owing to toxicity to bacteria. 11. In generating the GST-IBV 3b fusion protein, problems were consistently encountered during attempts to scale up protein expression and purification, so multiple small-scale productions were performed instead. 12 Additionally, one-half of the volume of water in the shaking water bath was added immediately before tubes were added, so that the water temperature gradually decreased over several minutes to 13.5 \u2022 C. 14. Any frothing of samples during the sonication process increases the likelihood of denaturing GST fusion proteins so that they are unable to bind to glutathione sepharose beads in subsequent steps. 15 . Multiple elution times were tested for their ability to yield high GST-IBV 3b concentrations, including 2 h, 4 h, 10 h, 24 h, and 48 h. 16. The same protocol is used for injecting rabbits with peptides, except that the micrograms of peptide used for each injection is doubled. 17. Rats can also be immunized to generate sera for co-localization experiments with rabbit sera. This protocol is also used for immunizing rats, except that 200 g of protein is required for the initial injection and 100 g of protein is required for all subsequent injections. 18. This injection schedule can be terminated early if rabbit sera show high enough titers following early injections. 19 . In our experience, screening sera by in vitro transcription and translation of protein is essential. We first obtained anti-IBV 3b sera from injecting rabbits with IBV 3b peptides. However, we screened these sera only by immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of transiently transfected and infected Vero cells. No specific IBV 3b staining was seen during this screening; therefore, we assumed that anti-IBV 3b antibodies were not generated. This result led us to inject rabbits with purified GST-IBV 3b fusion proteins. Screening of these new sera using in vitro transcribed and translated IBV 3b demonstrated that high titers of anti-IBV 3b antibodies had been generated (29). However, IBV 3b could still not be detected in Vero cells. Further experiments demonstrated that the extremely short half-life of IBV 3b in transiently transfected or infected Vero cells hampers its visualization in these cells. However, IBV 3b is readily detected in chicken cells since it is turned over differently in these cells. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the antibody production using IBV 3b peptides showed similar staining patterns in chicken cells as the antibodies generated from GST-IBV 3b fusion proteins. IBV 3b was eventually detected by immunoprecipitation from Vero cells by increasing the dish size and the amount of radioactive label. Representative results are shown in Fig. 4 . 20. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods can be used for screening sera. However, antibodies may show different binding affinities depending on the methods used. Therefore, screening sera using methods that will be used in future experiments is generally more informative. 21. The amount of primary antibody needed for immunoprecipitation reactions must be titered to ensure that antibodies are saturating. Therefore, immunoprecip- Fig. 4 . Cell type may affect the expression of coronavirus accessory proteins. Plasmids encoding IBV 3b and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were transiently transfected into Vero and DF1 cells according to the protocol in Section 3.9. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy according to the protocol in Section 3.11 with rabbit anti-IBV 3b and mouse anti-GFP primary antibodies. IBV 3b could not be detected in Vero cells, but was readily detected in DF1 cells. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that a greatly decreased IBV 3b half-life in Vero cells was responsible for the inability to visualize the protein in Vero cells (29) .",

            "text": "itation procedures are repeated with the supernatant to confirm that antibodies are in excess to antigen. We generally use 2 or 3 l of serum for each immunoprecipitation. 22 . Antibodies are often able to access their epitopes differently under different immunofluorescence microscopy fixation and permeabilization conditions. Therefore, alternate fixation and permeabilization conditions may have to be employed when screening antibodies: (i) concurrent fixation and permeabilization in PBS supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.18% TritonX-100 for 10 min at room temperature; (ii) concurrent fixation and permeabilization in methanol for 5 min at -20 \u2022 C; (iii) fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization in methanol of 5 min at -20 \u2022 C; (iv) concurrent fixation and permeabilization in a 75% methanol, 25% acetic acid solution for 10 min at room temperature; (v) fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization in PBS supplemented with 0.05% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin. For alternate protocol (v) all subsequent washes and incubations with antibodies should be done in PBS/Gly supplemented with 0.05% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin. 23. Affinity purification using GST fusion proteins: wash the column with 10 ml of kit equilibration buffer #1, followed by an additional wash with 10 ml of kit equilibration buffer #2. 24. Affinity purification using GST fusion proteins: add 1 ml of the diluted protein to the column and incubate them together for 60 min at room temperature. 25. The column is eluted with 9 ml of kit equilibration buffer #2. 2-ml fractions are collected. 26. If the absorbance of the eluate is similar (given dilution factors) to the absorbance measured at the end of step 2, then the eluate should be reincubated with the coupling column and reeluted. 27. Affinity purification using GST fusion proteins: In order to remove antibodies that recognize GST, the entire procedure found in Section 3.6 can first be done using a column containing GST-coupled beads. The flow-through from this step is saved (it contains antibodies specific to the viral protein) and incubated with a different column that has the GST fusion protein coupled to it. 28. After fractions are collected, the column can be stored for reuse. To store the column it must first be washed with 10 ml of 0.02% (w/v) NaN 3 in PBS. 2 ml of storage buffer is then added and the column is stored at 4 \u2022 C. Before reuse, the column should be washed once in elution buffer. 29 . To obtain quality images by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, cells should be infected or transfected when they are approximately 50% confluent. However, to obtain higher levels of protein expression when immunoblotting or immunoprecipitating, cells can be infected or transfected when they are as high as 70-90% confluent. 30. As a control for antibody specificity, sera from rabbits immunized with peptides can be preincubated with purified peptide before use in indirect immunofluores-cence microscopy. 20 l of serum is mixed with 20 l of a solution containing 10 mg of peptide per 10 l of dH 2 O and rotated for 1 h at 4 \u2022 C. 160 l of a solution containing 1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS/Gly is then added to the antibody mixture and rotated overnight at 4 \u2022 C. This antibody mixture is then diluted approximately 1:10 and used as the primary antibody in Section 3.11. Representative results of peptide-blocked versus unblocked antibody are shown in Fig. 5 . 31. For visualization on an inverted microscope, coverslips can be sealed onto the slides by brushing boat sealer or nail polish around the edges of the coverslip. 32. For visualizing immunoprecipitated, unlabeled proteins, start the Section 3.12 protocol at step 2 and continue through step 9. Then perform the entire immunoblotting protocol. Rabbit primary antibodies can be used if the protein of interest is less than 20 kDa in size (approximately the size of the rabbit IgG light chains). Alternatively, primary antibodies from a different species can be used for immunoblotting. 33. Proteins with half-lives shorter than 30 min, such as IBV 3b when expressed in Vero cells (29), may not be easily visualized in certain cell types. Therefore, cells may have to be plated in larger dishes and incubated with increased amounts of radioactivity. 34. For reproducible results, gels must be washed no longer than 10 min in dH 2 O.",

Fixation of gels with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid did not prevent diffusion of these proteins out of the gel in longer wash times. 35. Clear visualization of the IBV 3a and IBV 3b proteins is best achieved on 17.5% low-bis polyacrylamide gels. However, the slightly larger IBV E protein is easily visualized on 12 or 15% low-bis polyacrylamide gels. The same ratio of polyacrylamide:bis-polyacrylamide used when making 17.5% low-bis gels should also be used when making 12 or 15% low-bis gels. Fig. 5 . Preincubation of sera with the peptides used to immunize rabbits can test antibody specificity. IBV-infected Vero cells (Section 3.7) were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Section 3.11) at 15 h postinfection. Sera from rabbits immunized with IBV 3a peptides were preincubated with either the IBV 3a peptide or dH 2 O, as detailed in Note 30.",
