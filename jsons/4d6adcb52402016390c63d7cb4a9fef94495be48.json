An understanding of atomic-level structure offers enormous potential to design rationally proteins that stimulate specific immune responses. Yet current vaccine development efforts makes little use of structural information. At the Vaccine Research Center, a major goal is to apply structural techniques to vaccine design for challenging pathogens, that include human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other enveloped viruses such as influenza, Ebola, and respiratory syncytial viruses. Our three-part strategy involves 1.) the definition of the functional viral spike at the atomic level 2.) achieving a structural understanding of how neutralizing antibodies recognize the spike, and 3.) rational development of proteins that can elicit a specific antibody response. Overall, our strategy aims to incorporate information about viral spike-antibody interactions, to assimilate immunogenic feedback, and to leverage recent advances in immunofocusing and computational biology.",

With HIV-1, the atomic-level definition of one such vulnerable site [1] and the discovery of individuals with broadly neutralizing sera that target this site [2] bodes well for our informatics-based approach. With Ebola and influenza viruses, structures of functional viral spikes have been determined [3, 4] , and sites of antibody vulnerability and elicitation of appropriate antibodies are under investigation. With respiratory syncytial virus, structures of closely related spikes have been determined [5] , and issues center on the elicitation of antibodies that defuse rather than exacerbate disease.",

These membranes are derived from the host cell, and among other purposes, serve to protect the internal components of the virus from immune recognition. While protective, the membrane is also a barrier: to infect a cell, enveloped viruses must breach not only the target host membrane, but also their own membranes. To do so, they utilize energy stored in metastable viral spikes that protrude through the viral membrane [6] . These spikes also target the virus to specific receptors on host cells, prior to the fusion event.",

Despite extensive effort, by our group and others, the trimeric functional spike has so far resisted atomic-level structure determination. Recent low resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM) studies have provided insight into possible gp120-gp41 subunit arrangements within a functional viral spike [12, 13] . Information from cryo-EM studies is being used in our efforts to design candidate Env molecules amenable to high resolution crystallographic analysis. Part of the difficulty in structurally characterizing the functional spike relates to the biology of HIV-1. Both gp120 and gp41 components of the viral spike undergo conformational rearrangements during viral entry (Fig. 39.2) . The binding by the gp120 component to the CD4 receptor is believed to induce large structural rearrangements [14, 15] , which are required for the formation of the binding site for a requisite coreceptor [16] , generally CXCR4 or CCR5 (reviewed in [17, 18] ). The gp41 component then utilizes a large conformational change, involving formation of a trimeric \"post-fusion\" coiled-coil [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , to fuse the viral and target cell membranes. Since the \"pre-fusion\" conformation of the viral spike [24] is believed to be the primary target for elicitation of neutralizing antibody, we have sought to understand its conformation in atomic-level detail.",

Most of the viral spikes that we have constructed have mutations that prevent the proteolytic cleavage of gp41 from gp120, which increases protein stability and ease of production. However, since cleaved viral spikes are antigenically and structurally distinct from uncleaved spikes, and represent the functional form of the molecule, methods for creating cleaved viral spikes are being optimized. gp41 peptides are currently being developed that bind to the N and C termini of gp120 and the co-crystallization of other published peptides is also being pursued [25] .",

Mapping antibody epitopes onto atomic-level structures Schematics of the viral spike (gp120 in red and gp41 in tan) are shown, first in the context of free HIV-1 virion (left-most image), then binding to CD4 (yellow) at the target cell surface. Binding to CD4 induces conformational changes that assemble the binding site for a requisite co-receptor (teal). Binding to co-receptor results in further conformational changes: the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of gp41 is thrown into the target cell membrane; the gp41 C-terminus rearranges to form the final coiled-coil structure with gp41 N and C termini in close proximity (right-most image).

This surface corresponds to regions with high concentrations of N-linked carbohydrate (glycan), suggesting that carbohydrate is seen as \"self\" by the humoral immune system and can form an immunologically \"silent\" face [10] . In the context of the functional viral spike, this glycan can protect neighboring epitopes through an \"evolving glycan shield\" [31] . These and other studies, defining for example protective variable loops [32] and conformational masking of antibody epitopes [33] , have led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that protects HIV-1 from the humoral immune response.",

            "text": "Currently, two lines of investigation have shown promise in our effort to harness structural biology for vaccine design. One line involves the delineation of functional constraints to identify potential footholds of conservation and exposure. We have investigated antibodies, called CD4-induced antibodies that bind to the co-receptor-binding site on gp120. These were found capable of neutralizing not only HIV-1, but also the more evolutionarily divergent HIV-2 [34] . They also accumulate to high titers in most HIV-1 infected individuals [34] . Unfortunately, the virus effectively hides the site of co-receptor binding prior to CD4 engagement [34, 35] . After CD4 engagement at the cell surface, the close proximity of the target-cell membrane sterically occludes potential sites of vulnerability on the co-receptor-binding site [36] . These studies demonstrate that functional constraints restrict epitope variation but do not necessarily expose epitopes sensitive to antibody neutralization. We are currently exploring whether the functional constraint of binding to the CD4 receptor, which -unlike the co-receptor-binding site -must be available as an initial site of attachment [1] , can provide a site of vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies. A second line of investigation involves structural characterization of monoclonal antibodies that neutralize diverse isolates of primary HIV-1 and comparative analysis to antibodies that do not neutralize the primary isolates. Only four antibodies that neutralize the primary isolates have thus far been characterized-the monoclonal antibodies 2F5, 2G12, 4E10, and b12 [37] [38] [39] [40] . We have determined the structures of 2F5 and b12, each with their HIV-1 envelope epitopes [1, 41] ( Fig. 39.3 ). In the case of the broadly neutralizing 2F5 antibody, the structure of the membrane-proximal external region of gp41, when bound by 2F5, was found to adopt an extended (Right) b12 antibody with gp120. The Fab of b12 is shown with heavy chain in green grasping its gp120 epitope, while the light chain in dark blue is positioned over 15 \u00c5 away from gp120. Coordinates from (1); PDB ID 2ny7 loop conformation -distinct from unbound structures of this region, which largely adopt alpha-helical conformations [41] . These structural differences prompted the hypothesis that the inability of existing immunogens against this region to elicit 2F5-like antibodies may partly be due to a lack of proper antigenic mimicry of the 2F5-bound form of gp41. In collaboration with Drs. David Baker and Bill Schief at the University of Washington, techniques of computational protein design are being used to develop heterologous epitope scaffolds that possess conformational mimics of the 2F5-bound form of gp41 on their surfaces. These epitope scaffolds not only provide a means for structural mimicry, but also serve to focus the immune response to specific sites within otherwise complex structures.",

Focusing on the conserved CD4-binding loop, the b12 epitope overlaps considerably with the CD4 contact surface on gp120 and extends further towards the glycan covered \"silent face\"; however, b12 has only peripheral interactions with the other conformationally mobile parts of the gp120, such as the residues that form the bridging sheet in the CD4-bound state of gp120. Our research indicated that b12 exploits the conformationally invariant and functionally conserved CD4-contact site to achieve neutralization [1] . With a vulnerable site on HIV-1 gp120 defined, we are pursuing collaborative studies to generate b12-binding immunogens in a number of different protein forms. These alternative forms include trimeric mimics of the viral spike, monomeric variants of gp120, domain versions of gp120 that retain b12 binding, and epitope-scaffold mimics believed to be unencumbered by most Env-based mechanisms of humoral evasion. Tests of these various formats in small animals should reveal their potential to elicit antibodies similar to the template broadly neutralizing ones.",

Such antibodies comprise a high percentage of the elicited antibody response in HIV-1 infected individuals. We have succeeded in determining the structure of F105 in complex with gp120 (Lei Chen and Young Do Kwon, personal communication). F105 is a prototypical CD4BS antibody and has been tested in Phase I clinical trials [42] : it shows broad recognition of monomeric gp120, competes with CD4 for binding, and neutralizes laboratory-adapted -but not primary -isolates of HIV-1. Analysis of the epitopes on gp120 for F105, b12 and CD4 shows they all bind to a very closely related site on gp120. Despite their similarity, one large difference we find is that the region that makes up the bridging sheet in the CD4-bound conformation of gp120 opens up in the F105-gp120 structure. Strands b20/b21 open to uncover a conserved hydrophobic surface, which serves as a focus of F105 binding. This suggests that antibodies like F105 need to access the hydrophobic region under the bridging sheet. To define F105 as a prototype for non-neutralizing CD4BS antibodies, we tethered the b20/b21 strands to the inner domain with a disulfide and observed inhibition of binding for most CD4BS antibodies, though not b12 or CD4. Thus, this result highlights the importance of occluding the hydrophobic region under the bridging sheet in vaccine immunogens designed to elicit b12-like antibodies, and also provides another example for how atomic-level structural information can be used in the development of a successful HIV vaccine.",

In our work to date, we have utilized X-ray crystallography almost exclusively, although collaborative efforts to obtain solution NMR structures have progressed [30, 56] . Elucidation of the trimeric HIV-1 Env spike structure is an important, though difficult, step towards rational design of an HIV-1 immunogen. Production of adequate amounts of highly purified protein is a necessary step towards obtaining crystals suitable for atomic-level analysis. We have assessed a number of expression systems for expressing HIV-1 Env glycoproteins suitable for structural analysis (Table 39 .1), and currently employ a mammalian cell-based transient transfection system for protein production (Fig. 39.6 ). However, high-resolution structural analysis has been hindered by difficulties in producing adequate amounts of stable HIV-1 recombinant envelope trimers. Interestingly, poor viral spike expression has also been observed for other members of the class I family of viral fusion proteins, including HIV-2/SIV, coronaviruses, and retroviruses. To address this problem, we have used glycosidase processing inhibitors, multiple transfection reagents and several target cell types to optimize trimer expression, glycan processing, and cost efficiency (Fig. 39.6) .

Obtaining suitable crystals for the highly glycosylated, conformationally flexible gp120, is in the best cases demanding and in the worst cases not possible. We have pioneered a number of cutting-edge crystallization strategies to increase our chances of success (Fig. 39.7) . These include variational protein crystallization [26] , in which a number of closely related proteins are assessed for crystallization. Thus, for example, to obtain a complex of a CD4-induced antibody with gp120, 5 CD4-induced antibodies were combined with 3 different Clade B gp120s to make 15 different complexes. Each of the 15 complexes was then assessed for crystallization, enhancing the overall probability of obtaining crystals suitable for structural analysis [29] . We have also utilized efficient high-throughput methods for screening crystallization conditions, employing factorization [57] , sparse matrices [58, 59] , and precipitant-focused methods of iterative optimization; and we have also embraced the latest automated structural genomic advances [60] such as crystallization robots [61, 62] and synchrotron-based means of data collection [63, 64] .",

To test the feasibility of clearing these hurdles, we have been attempting to apply structural biology to other viruses. Ebola virus is an enveloped, negative-strand RNA virus, belonging to the Filoviridae family. Ebola virus infection causes severe haemorrhagic fever, and depending on the strain, results in up to 90% mortality. A single envelope glycoprotein on the virion surface is responsible for attachment and entry into permissive cells, presumably via receptormediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis, the glycoprotein is cleaved by cathepsin B and/or cathepsin L in the acidic endosome environment and potentially triggers membrane fusion, which subsequently allows for the entry of the Ebola nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm [73) .",

One of the methods that can be employed to immunofocus the response is silencing regions that are not biologically relevant or known to elicit an unfavorable immune response. For example, the human neutralizing antibody, KZ52, binds to GP1:GP2 residues in the base region crystals are checked for x-ray diffraction. Good diffraction data is solved for the crystal structure of the protein or protein complex. The Crystal Optimization Cycle is used for optimizing the initial crystallization screening conditions, and for optimizing conditions which result in poor crystals. Imaging data is scored manually, which is used to generate a new crystallization matrix, referred to as an optimized screen. This is based on the optimizing of only the precipitant within each condition of the screen of the trimer [3] . We can effectively focus the immunogen to elicit antibodies to the conserved trimer core through the addition of glycans to specific resides to which KZ52 binds. Another approach is to remove the highly glycosylated mucinlike region, which may play a role in providing the ultimate virus immune evasion strategy. Removal of this region also focuses the immune response to the exposed highly conserved receptor binding core. Our current immunogen approach, to target the highly conserved receptor-binding domain, may also result in generating protection against many, if not all, Ebola virus strains. Knowledge of the crystal structure of the prefusion Ebola glycoprotein also allows us to create recombinant proteins that mimic the processed glycoprotein that may represent a conserved but otherwise inaccessible form of the protein that may be sensitive to neutralization.",

In addition to humans, influenza also infects numerous species of mammals and birds, although wild waterfowl are thought to be the primary reservoir [74] . Influenza is a spherically-shaped single-strand negative sense RNA virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. The outer viral surface comprises three membrane-anchored proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and M2. HA is the most abundant and immunogenic of the three. To date, all neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to influenza target HA; no neutralizing antibodies against NA or M2 have been reported. Crystal structures of H1, H3, H5, H7, H9 and B HAs have each revealed a 13.5 nm cylinder-shaped homotrimeric glycoprotein consisting of a mostly b-sheet globular head sitting atop a predominantly helical stem region (Fig. 39.9a ) [4, 75, 76] . HA is a class I fusion protein that is cleaved during expression to generate HA1 and an HA2 with an N-terminal fusion peptide. The head region of HA recognizes terminal sialic acid (i.e. the receptor) on the surface of the host cell to facilitate viral internalization. Upon acidification below pH 6.0 in the endosome, HA undergoes a dramatic conformational change that promotes insertion of the fusion peptide into the host membrane and brings the viral and host transmembrane regions of HA into close enough proximity to induce membrane fusion.",

To date, most human infections have resulted from H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, and H3N2 strains, although more recently 390 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 infections and a handful of H7 and H9 infections of humans have been reported [77] .

Influenza is highly immunogenic; vaccines created from inactivated or liveattenuated virus are generally effective without the need for a booster shot or the use of adjuvants. Unfortunately, selective pressure from the immune system of hosts combined with an error prone viral RNA polymerase promotes rapid mutation of the influenza viral surface proteins (referred to as antigenic drift) as well as genetic reassortments. As a result, new trivalent vaccines need to be generated each year using the strains of H1N1, H3N2 and B-type influenza that are predicted to be in circulation six months later during the upcoming flu season [79] . Not only does this require a significant outpouring of time and resources every year, but the predictions regarding upcoming influenza strains are not always on target. Furthermore, a large unpredicted human outbreak from a pathogenic avian subtype such as H5N1 would not be covered by current vaccines.",

In 1993, Okuno and colleagues reported the generation of a broadly neutralizing murine antibody that could neutralize H1, H2, H5 and some H6 HAs [80] . More recently Kashyap and colleagues reported on broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize divergent H1 and H5 strains [81] . These reports suggest that conserved regions of HA can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. When sequence conservation is mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of HA, it is evident that the stem region consisting mostly of HA2 is much more conserved than the HA1-head region (Fig. 9b) . Since most neutralizing HA epitopes are located on the highly variable head region, we are presently exploring methods to immunofocus antibodies to the conserved HA-stem. The methods we are employing include PEG/glycan silencing, antigenic resurfacing and protein truncation of immunodominant regions as well as removal of native glycosylation and conformational stabilization (Fig. 9c) . Our ultimate goal is to design an influenza immunogen that will elicit antibodies that broadly neutralize not only against multiple strains but even against multiple subtypes of influenza over time spans of many years.",

Atomic-level structures of trimeric F proteins from related viruses in both pre-fusion and postfusion conformations exist [5, 85, 86] , allowing for a molecular understanding of interactions within the viral spike that is currently not available for HIV-1. We hope to apply many of the methods and techniques originally developed for creating HIV-1 immunogens to the design of an effective RSV F protein-based vaccine. These include the attachment of heterologous trimerization domains to the C-terminus of the RSV viral spike, to stabilize it in its prefusion conformation. Other efforts include the use of epitope-scaffold technologies to focus the immune response onto appropriate areas. Definition of beneficial immune responses and their mechanisms of protection against RSV may be necessary to prevent deleterious immunization effects.",

Whether the confluence of structural information with protein design and immune analysis is sufficient to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies will depend in part on our ability to optimize the immune response and also on the rationale of conformational mimicry, epitope accessibility, neutralization breadth, and target specificity. Our investigations have already provided insight into the parameters governing antibody elicitation and neutralization. Whether such basic science discoveries will provide benefits to public health depends on our ability to translate them from the laboratory to the clinic, a critical step facilitated by close interactions with other laboratories at the center. True success with HIV-1 will ultimately depend on whether we succeed in creating immunogens that can elicit broadly neutralizing responses which can then be translated into vaccine regimens capable of substantially reducing the incidence of HIV-1 infection in humans. Other future and past pandemic pathogens such as Ebola virus and influenza A virus may also be surmounted with structure-assisted efforts.",

Each of these formats can be modified by antigenic resurfacing, conformational stabilization and/or PEG/glycan silencing, to focus the immune response onto the b12-identified site of vulnerability to yield results.

Transient transfections with 293GnTi-cells and 293Fectin had ~20% higher CAAN-gp140 yield as compared to transfections with Freestyle MAX (Invitrogen) and PEI-MAX (Polysciences) in the same cells. From these results, we conclude that 293GnTi-cells may be the most cost-effective option since glycosidase inhibitors are unnecessary and there is not a significant drop in yield. (c) Effect on the purity. A construct encoding a clade A gp140 (fibritin trimerization domain appended C-terminal to the gp41 ectodomain) was tested in transient transfections on 293Freestyle cells (293F), Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) and 293GnTicells (GnTi-).

The crystal structure (3) of the ectodomain of the Ebola Zaire prefusion viral spike is depicted in Ca-backbone representation. It adopts an open chalice-like shape of GP1 (each monomer is a different shade of orange), held together by a belt of GP2 (monomers shown in various shades of green). The receptor-binding domain is localized between residues 54 and 201 of GP1(88), of which 6 residues of known critical importance for virus entry have been mapped onto the structure (shown in blue). These residues are located in the head region, which itself is surrounded by a glycan cap containing several N-linked glycan sites (shown in red). The mucin-like domain of GP1, which was not included in the protein crystallized, would be modeled to surround the glycan cap and further extensively glycosylate the protein with both N-and O-linked sugars.
