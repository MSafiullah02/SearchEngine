Moreover, confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 may experience fear of severe disease consequences and the contagion (Xiang et al., 2020). Consequently, they may experience loneliness, denial, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and despair, which may lower treatment efficacy. A few of these patients may even be associated with increased risk of aggression and suicide attempts. Suspected isolated cases may suffer from anxiety due to uncertainty about their health status and develop obsessive-compulsive symptoms, such as repeated temperature check and sterilization. The degree of psychological stress in isolated patients has been found to be higher, and their psychological problems are prominent (Hawryluck et al., 2004). In addition, it was reported that healthcare workers in hospitals with lesser wards and workers for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions of China experienced psychological burdens. Especially, nurses living in Wuhan and frontline healthcare workers who were directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were severely affected (Lai et al., 2020). An investigation of the mental health status of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia revealed that the rates of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and physical symptoms were 49.06, 56.60, 67.92, and 69.81%, respectively, and 24.53% of the patients were reported to engage in self-injury and suicide ideation (Zhao, 2020).",

            "text": "Innate and adaptive immune mechanisms provide effective defense against infections and regulate autoimmune responses. Infections can trigger chronic inflammation, which damages cognitive function. In humans, it has been observed that early hospitalization for patients with autoimmune disease or infectious disease can increase the risk of a major mood disorder by 45 and 62%, respectively (Pape et al., 2019). Depression is a widespread chronic illness that can affect thoughts, mood, and physical health. It is characterized by sadness, low mood, lack of energy, insomnia, and anhedonia (Novellino et al., 2020). Higher depression and anxiety scores are associated with an enhanced inflammatory state, as assessed by higher hematological inflammatory markers, including white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cell distribution width (Shafiee et al., 2017). Observational studies have shown that other indicators of immunity, especially C-reactive protein (CRP) and proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), are associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders (Haapakoski et al., 2016). In order to study the immune response and mental health status of convalescent COVID-19 patients, an online questionnaire and retrospective analysis of the physical examination data from these patients after discharge were completed. All patient information was collected with their informed consent.",

With increased reports on the recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA, all COVID-19 survivors in convalescence were under forced-quarantine and clinical observation for 14 days at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center (SSMC) immediately after being discharged from the designated hospital since February 21, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. This study was conducted at SSMC, a municipal general hospital in Shenzhen, China. SSMC is the designated hospital for the isolation and observation of COVID-19 survivors during their early recovery stage, rendering it a suitable place to identify eligible study subjects. There were a total of 226 patients between February 21 to March 14, 2020 at SSMC. Among these, 126 patients completed the online questionnaire from March 2 to March 12, and 96 patients were clinically examined from March 5 to March 14, 2020. The online questionnaire was designed to investigate their mental health status in the isolation ward, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), Zung anxiety self-rating scale, and Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS). An SDS index score of 50 was the cut-off point for clinical significance (Zung, 1965). Epidemiological characteristics, including age, gender, comorbidities, potential effect of severity of initial infection, SARS-CoV-2 recurrence, and duration of initial illness (hospital stay, average number of days) were investigated in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Other COVID-19-related medical data were collected by telephone interviews and through checking medical records.",

After comparing the WBC counts between cured COVID patients with and without self-reported depression, results showed that the WBC count was higher in the self-reported depression group (6.7 \u00b1 1.5 \u00d7109/L) than in the normal group (6.0 \u00b1 1.5 \u00d7109/L). The NEUT count was significantly higher in the self-reported depression group (4.1 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7109/L) compared with the normal group (3.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7109/L) (p < 0.001; Table 2\n). Meanwhile, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly higher in the self-reported depression group compared with the normal group (1.8 \u00b1 0.6 in normal group vs 2.4 \u00b1 0.9 in the depression group; p < 0.001).",

            "text": "SDS is a self-rating instrument designed to detect symptoms related to depression and to measure the severity of depression in the general medical outpatient population (Zung, 1965). SDS consists of 20 items with a Likert-type scale, with raw scores that range from 20 to 80, which are converted to index scores by dividing the sum of the raw scores by 80, and then multiplying by 100. A raw score-index score conversion table has previously been provided by Zung (Zung, 1971). An SDS index score of 50 (raw score = 40) suggests clinically significant symptoms with the following three levels of severity ratings: index scores 25\u201349 (raw scores 20\u201340): normal; 50\u201359 (raw scores 41\u201347): mild to moderate; 60\u201369 (raw scores 48\u201355): moderate to severe; and 70 and above (raw scores 56 and above): severe (Zung, 1973). While SDS scales continue to be widely utilized, its application is associated with several challenges, with clinical cut-offs frequently being incorrectly applied (Dunstan and Scott, 2018). An SDS raw score of 50 has been recommended as the cut-off point for clinical significance (Dunstan and Scott, 2019). In order to help eliminate anxiety and mild depression in convalescent COVID-19 patients, we adopted a lower standard (index scores of 50) in this study. In patients with self-reported depression, even a small reduction of such risk may translate into better prognosis and improve quality of life.",

There is a lack of data to verify whether these immune responses return to normal in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. Psychological stress has been shown to affect the immune system (M\u00e9nard et al., 2016).

The results from patients with self-reported depression demonstrated an increase in WBC and NEUT counts as well as NLR, which are similar to previous data on NLR and platelet-lymphocyte ratio in patients with different levels of depressive symptoms (Kayhan et al., 2017). NLR is calculated as ratio between absolute NEUT count and absolute LYM count. In a previous study, it was reported that NLR is increased in elderly patients after the first episode of depression (Arabska et al., 2018). Additionally, the NLR was significantly higher in unmedicated patients with depression than in healthy controls (2.10 \u00b1 2.13 vs 2.01 \u00b1 0.75, p = 0.004), and it was higher after the first episode of depression than after recurrent episodes (2.11 \u00b1 1.76 vs 1.64 \u00b1 1.04, p < 0.05). In our study, the NLR was significantly higher in the self-reported depression group compared with the normal group (2.4 \u00b1 0.9 vs 1.8 \u00b1 0.6, p < 0.001).

According to our analyses, the difference in CRP levels between the normal and self-reported depression groups was significant.
