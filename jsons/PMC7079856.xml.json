They are responsible for the spread of communicable diseases prone to cause epidemics, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), an important contributor to human morbidity and mortality [1]. Take, for example, the recent cases of Zika outbreak in America and Ebola epidemics in West Africa. These overlapping global crises were caused by already known pathogens that can now spread around the world much faster than ever as a result of the increased population mobility, the intensified trade in goods and services, the climate change, and other factors linked to globalization [2]. High death rates from infectious diseases commonly appear in the context of poverty, poor diets, and limited infrastructure found in developing countries. Water, food, and environmental quality are key elements to prevent and control infectious diseases in a globalizing world. In this context, rapid and cost-effective detection of pathogens at the \u201cpoint-of-need\u201d is a critical demand, not only for clinical diagnosis but also for food safety testing and environmental monitoring.",

These methods involve multiple thermocycling steps in high-precision instruments difficult to miniaturize, requiring stringent conditions of laboratory compartmentalization and thus almost exclusively performed in centralized laboratories with high-end instrumentation [4]. An ideal test for point-of-need pathogen detection should meet the ASSURED\u2014affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and delivered to those who need it\u2014criteria outlined by the WHO [5]. With an incremental knowledge on the complex in vivo nucleic acid amplification processes, which are essential in biological systems [6], novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods are gaining their importance for the development of analytical devices aimed to meet those ideal criteria. Isothermal amplification methods can be easily integrated into simple and low-energy consumption microsystems, which may in the future outperform PCR for pathogen detection. These methods include loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), signal-mediated amplification of RNA technology (SMART), and strand displacement amplification (SDA). Previously published reviews [6] gave a broad description of these methods and their potential applications. This review focuses in one of these emerging methodologies, HDA, giving a look into the most recent HDA-based analytical methods for the detection of pathogens. We endeavored to highlight new methods for the detection of HDA amplification products as well as relevant systems to integrate sample treatment, amplification, and detection, with the future trends forecasted to conclude.",

To find the oligonucleotide primers pair that leads to high yield of a target-specific amplicon, several primer combinations are often tailored by using online programs originally devised to design PCR primers (Primer3 [11] and PrimerQuest [12]). For that, specific recommendations for the isothermal technique should be borne in mind, namely: (a) primer size ranging from 24 to 33 nucleotides, (b) melting temperature, Tm, from 60 to 74 \u00b0C, and (c) GC% within the interval 35-60% [13]. However, successful HDA amplification has been achieved when relaxing some of these constraints as well. Afterwards, primer candidates are examined for potential dimer and self-dimer formation, first in silico employing DNA folding algorithms [14], and then experimentally screened. Likewise, BLAST analysis [15] must be carried out to exclude homology to nontarget sequences.",

These problems, mainly attributed to unwanted primer dimers and off-target interactions, are more prevalent in isothermal amplification techniques due to the lack of an annealing step from high to low temperatures to form Watson-Crick base pairing. A particular feature of HDA is, however, the recommended long size of HDA primers with respect to PCR counterparts, which feeds confusion between specific amplicons and spurious products, and hence false positive results, as a consequence of their similar size [16]. The risk of primer-dimer artifacts would therefore justify the lower primer concentrations used in HDA (75\u2013100 nM) when comparing with PCR (0.1\u20131 \u03bcM).",

Unblockage and activation of the primers only take place once they hybridize with the target DNA and the ribonucleotide linkage is subsequently cleaved by a hot-start RNase H2. At 65 \u00b0C, optimal temperature for HDA, RNase H2 becomes fully active and releases a DNA fragment with a 3\u2032-hydroxyl group able to initiate the amplification [17].

SAMRS draws on a set of dNTP analogues (A*, T*, G*, and C*) that have been designed to pair with natural nucleobases but not with each other, based on the number of hydrogen bonds [18]. Therefore, primers built from SAMRS hybridize with the target but they do not interact with each other, avoiding primer-dimer artifacts. Thermophilic enzymes (polymerase and helicase) have demonstrated their capability to work with SAMRS-structurally altered nucleotides by just adjusting Mg2+ concentration [19], albeit the best yield has been reported when four SAMRS components are placed at the 3\u2032-end of the primers, followed by one terminal natural nucleotide.

This causes false positive results and adversely affects the detectability and robustness of the methods based on this amplification reaction. Although a careful primer design can reduce primer-dimer formation, this process and unspecific amplification are more pronounced in HDA than in PCR [16], and fundamentally occur because no hot-start polymerase for HDA is currently available. This is especially a problem for the detection of low copy number targets due to the long time required for amplification, and in the design of multiplex amplifications where various pairs of primers must function together. Besides the HDA modification explained before, termed blocked-primer HDA, in which DNA polymerase cannot extend the primers until they are cleaved by a thermostable RNase [17] giving rise to a quasi-hot-start amplification method, selectivity of the amplification may be modulated by careful optimization of the reaction conditions. The use of additives frequently employed in PCR, such as DMSO, betaine, and sorbitol, which reduce DNA secondary structures facilitating primer annealing, has proven to be effective in HDA amplification [22], improving its yield and specificity. However, these additives can also greatly reduce the activity of polymerase. Therefore, it is important to test different concentrations to find the best conditions for each amplification system. Similarly, macromolecular crowding agents (polyethylene glycol, dextran, Ficoll) that mimic the conditions for amplification in natural systems, increase the speed of polymerase and affect the structure of DNA, improving yield, robustness, and specificity [23]. The optimization of reaction enzymes mixture is another important issue; for example, it has been demonstrated that, surprisingly, lowering the concentration of both ATP and dNTPs with respect to that usually employed improves the efficiency and selectivity of HDA, suppressing primer-dimer formation, and thus reduces the background amplification problems [24]. All these measures may be combined, and it is of paramount importance to experimentally determine the optimal amount of all additives and reagents for each amplification system.",

Mimicking the natural process of mismatch repair in which helicase is involved, restriction enzymes are selected to cleave a sequence near the place where primers anneal, generating blunt ends that help recruiting and loading the helicase [23]. This improves the effective loading of the helicase and thus accelerates the HDA reaction. However, it renders the design more challenging since it is necessary to find an enzyme capable of cutting the dsDNA close to the target sequence, without fragmenting it.",

To increase the speed of DNA synthesis, a new bifunctional protein, termed helimerase, has been engineered by linking the UvrD helicase with Bst-DNA polymerase [26].

            "text": "Monitoring the amplification in real time is the most straightforward solution. Real-time HDA was first developed using a non-mutagenic non-cytotoxic fluorescent intercalator (EvaGreen) that is only fluorescent when bound to dsDNA, which ensures low background signals [29]. Besides, it shows less amplification inhibition than SYBR Green [30]. Since no temperature cycles are performed, the analytical signal is the time needed to exceed an established threshold in fluorescence intensity. This time decreases with target concentration, as expected, and with the primer concentration used. This means that the amplification speed is boosted by the amount of primers in solution. However, an enhancement in primer-dimer amplification occurs, limiting the improvement in detectability [31]. In fact, detailed comparison of HDA and PCR suggests that the primer concentration to obtain the lowest limit of detection (1 f. for oligonucleotide template) is 75 nM. For PCR, higher primer concentration, above 200 nM, permitted reaching a smaller limit of detection, 100 aM. From real-time experiments, HDA has been claimed to be faster than PCR [16] but no good linearity was obtained. More recently, HDA was proven to be slightly slower than PCR [32] and doubling times (equivalent to one cycle in PCR) are reported to consistently range from 50 s [33] to 78 s [17, 32, 34], sometimes longer than usual PCR cycles. Good linearity achieved for real-time HDA assays allowed the detection of two human papillomavirus types using plasmids in clinical samples [29].",

To improve selectivity and allow multiplex assays, specific probes such as molecular beacons, FRET, TaqMan, or Scorpions probes are specifically designed to hybridize with a short fragment of the target strand (Fig. 2a, right panel). TaqMan MGB (minor groove binder) probes were first used in combination with two DNA polymerases with 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity [36]. These probes are shorter than conventional TaqMan probes because of the special quencher that binds to the minor groove increasing the overall binding energy expected for a probe of the same size. The probes were designed to have a melting temperature close to the HDA optimized one (63\u201365 \u00b0C). The Gst DNA polymerase was very efficient in cleaving the probe, which increased dramatically the signal-to-noise ratio and, as a consequence, reduced the threshold time (transformed into threshold cycle, Ct, by analogy with PCR). Taq polymerase was also efficient under isothermal conditions, even though it is intended to work after each denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C. Asymmetric amplification is not needed but it can speed up the reaction when using one of the primers at concentration above the recommended 75 nM provided no unspecific amplification is promoted. Multiplex detection is possible using hydrolysis probes but optimization is critical for target sequences with very different copy number and requires a denaturing step, so it is not entirely isothermal. In any case, the amplification is slower than for individual amplifications.\n",

However, end-point detection was finally selected after careful optimization of components in the multiplex assay. The hairpin probe is not fluorescent in solution but it fluoresces after hybridization with the amplified target. Unlike TaqMan probes, polymerases with no exonuclease activity are required in order to maintain the probe hybridized to the amplified strand. Asymmetry ratio of 1:3, with concentration above 25 nM for the limiting one, amplified preferentially the strand complementary to the probe, improving the end-point signal. Initial alkaline denaturation at 65 \u00b0C was more effective than the thermal shock at 95 \u00b0C, making this method completely isothermal. HDA was inhibited with 50\u2013100 ng of human genomic DNA but this limitation was overcome with a sequence-specific isolation and purification of the bacterial DNA. This method is based on hybridization with RNA oligonucleotides complementary to the analyte far from the target sequence and entrapment and preconcentration on magnetic beads covered with antibodies specific for RNA-DNA hybrids. The purification thus provides ssDNA as an input sequence for HDA using probes with a fluorophore and a quencher for detection (Fig. 2b and left panel). In such a way, as low as 25 cells/mL of two different bacteria were detected simultaneously, 2.5\u20135 times higher than for individual amplifications, in about 3 h including sample preparation [37].",

This probe hybridizes with the biotinylated strand, forming a partial duplex. This particular hybridization decreases the chance of detecting unspecific products. Then, the partial duplex enters the LFD where it binds to streptavidin-conjugated color particles and is finally captured by the appropriate antibody on the detection line (Fig. 3). This way, duplex amplifications (two targets in a single experiment) can be carried out, one of them being the internal control of amplification [40, 41]. Commercial kits for some pathogen are currently marketed [42]. The assay for Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 in genital and oral lesions was cleared by FDA in 2011 and it does not require nucleic acid extraction [43]. A simple dilution allows detection of as low as 5.5 and 34.1 copies of HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, per reaction within 1.5 h [44]. Manual extraction amenable to resource-limited places reached 470 copies/reaction of HIV-1 DNA from dried blood spots with LFD [45]. The identification at species level of Plasmodium malaria parasite is possible by careful selection of the hybridization probes and primers [46]. Three probes with different labels were designed for a single HDA assay; one for all Plasmodium species, a second one specific for P. falciparum, and the third as an internal control. A second HDA amplification with a specific primer for P. vivax and the first and third probes allowed the detection of this species in LFD cartridges. No extraction of DNA from the protozoon is needed. The sensitivity is 5 to 10 times lower when applied to patient samples (200 parasites/\u03bcL) instead of spiked human blood. Microtiter plate version of these LFD with colorimetric enzymatic detection was also demonstrated for detecting 10 copies of the ureC gen of Helicobacter pylori [47].

Hybridization-based target capture on surfaces is a simpler and cost-effective alternative to immunocapturing. A specific short capture probe partially complementary to asymmetrically amplified biotinylated-strand is usually anchored on the surface. Further enzymatic labeling allows optical measurement (Fig. 4). A variety of surface chemistries have been applied to construct the DNA chip from the simplicity of polypropylene sheets that only require aminated probes and UV-cross-linking [48] to silicon nitride wafers that are not biologically compatible and need two additional layers of polydimethylsiloxane and poly(phenylalanine-lysine), respectively [17, 33]. Those layers introduce a large number of amine groups for further DNA binding, achieving an optimal DNA coverage of 1.5\u00d71012 molecules/cm2 and 100% hybridization efficiency [49]. Hydrazine-terminated DNA capture probes were cross-linked using N-succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate and these modified surfaces are stable up to 9 months at 37 \u00b0C [34]. In both assays, asymmetric HDA is performed (1:4 and 1:2, respectively) and the biotinylated strand is captured on the chip surface. It is worth noting the high concentration of primer used in the second approach (above 100 nM).\n",

The limit of detection for pure species is 1 cfu/reaction (about 3000 cfu/mL) but increases 10 to 30 times in the presence of several species. The time turnaround is shortened to 30 min when performing a symmetric HDA in the hybridization chip [34].

Minimization of unspecific products using as low as 5 nM of the limiting primer was essential. Reduction of the salt concentration during the hybridization step from 1 to 0.1 M NaCl was also needed to achieve a limit of detection of 0.5 aM of a synthetic specific sequence (15 copies). This value rivals the detectability of an analogous assay using PCR (11 copies) [32]. Symmetric HDA was faster (30 min versus 90 min) than the asymmetric one but 10 times less sensitive when combined with the hybridization assay even after a denaturation step to separate the duplex. The amplification factor of asymmetric HDA was calculated to be 106 respective to the genomagnetic assay, which explains the ultrasensitivity.

Imidazol moieties bind to CdSeS/ZnS-probe oligonucleotides to complete the sensing surface. Optimization of quantum dot concentration improved the limit of detection up to 7.5 times. Paper modification is stable for at least 2 wk and reusable up to five times [53]. This platform was combined with a sandwich hybridization assay, which was performed with hybridization probes with an acceptor fluorophore in the nearest end to the quantum dot platform. FRET-based transduction allows the detection of the decreasing emission of the donor QD, the increasing emission of the acceptor fluorophore, or, as in this work, the ratio of both signals, which is more powerful to discriminate low concentrations. SNP selectivity was reached by adjusting the concentration of formamide and the ionic strength in the hybridization step. An amplification factor of 107 was estimated permitting the detection of 37 zmol of a synthetic sequence corresponding to a diagnostic marker of E. coli in 3 h [52].

Membrane-based devices are well suited for low cost analysis, and several materials were tested [54]. While glass-fiber and nitrocellulose inhibit both PCR and isothermal amplifications due to strong enzyme adsorption, polycarbonate impeded HDA when carried out within its pores but not when some liquid remains. Polyethersulfone showed the best compatibility with both PCR and isothermal amplification. Cellulose can also be used after BSA treatment to avoid enzyme adsorption [55]. The mixture of enzymes for HDA amplification is stable, after drying on paper, at room temperature for about 1 month, probably due to the presence of high molecular weight carbohydrate in the formulation. A rapid HDA detection of M. tuberculosis (10 min) was performed in this substrate using three times higher concentration of enzymes to compensate adsorption and PicoGreen as fluorescent dye. Amplification occurred even at 50 \u00b0C achieved with a hand warmer. This qualitative assay offers a limit of detection of 100 copies. Easy and efficient extraction of DNA from cell lysate on paper inserted on a pipette was also shown [56]. The isothermal amplification of Chlamydia trachomatis was carried out in the sealed pipette and detected in a LFD. In this way, an easily operated and rapid diagnostic platform useful for point-of-care detection of sexually transmitted infectious is presented, with improved limit of detection compared with the immunoassays typically employed for this purpose. Although not truly integrated, sample preparation and amplification are combined by using a syringe or bicycle pump to remove the cellular lysis solution and transfer the HDA solution after amplification. These pumps combined with toe warmers make this approach electricity-free. A pump-based extraction with a hand-warmer heated amplification was also employed to detect Clostridium difficile in stool samples [57]. Positive amplifications were detected by PAGE after on-chip HDA for 45 min, including warming up. Channels were coated with a costly polymer to limit enzyme adsorption. Formation of primer-dimers was not negligible and attributed to the high surface to volume ratio, contrary to the observation of Jenison et al. [34], but might be reduced by adding DMSO. Similarly, a modular device using chip-based DNA hybridization with optical detection was reported without the need of power supply [48].",

Slightly lower detectability for S. aureus, 5\u00d7104 versus 2\u00d7104 cells, was achieved in the first on-chip HDA automated assay [63]. The aminated primer was linked to an epoxysilanized glass slide. Only one primer was added to a minimum of 150 \u03bcL of solution, which consumed 3-fold amount of reagents. Programmed pump mixing during the 120 min of HDA with automatic washing steps at 30 \u00b0C leaves the surface ready for laser scanning of the fluorophore-labeled duplex anchored on the surface.

Under those conditions, it is believed that amplification initiates in solution until almost complete depletion of the limiting primer. Then the amplification shifts to the surface promoted by the longer anchored primer. This pathway is supported by a delay reported on ITO-modified surfaces, which implied a minimum of 90 min for amplicon detection. No differences with blank experiments were obtained at 75 min. The fluorescein-labeled duplex synthesized on the surface was electrochemically detected by DPV after enzymatic labeling with alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Peroxidase could not be used because the enzymatic product, the oxidized TMB, presents a large overpotential that precludes its detection at usual potentials. Transparent ITO surfaces are also compatible with optical detection but UV-vis detection offered one order of magnitude higher limit of detection even though peroxidase, which has a higher turnover than ALP, was used. Only 10 genomic copies of Salmonella were detected electrochemically, which matches real-time PCR approaches. Interestingly, the ITO modified surface was stable under dry conditions for 9 months provided that a mixture of BSA and glucose, both at 2.5%, was previously added. A rehydration step is also needed before use. This extended storage stability is highly desirable for electrochemical DNA-based sensors mostly based on fairly stable self-assembled monolayers on Au.",

Elimination of unintended contamination during sample processing is of utmost importance in clinical diagnosis. Addition of a non-target specific sequence at a large copy number or contaminating the sample with a defined amount of bacteria, the amplification of the contaminant species can be completely suppressed because of the limited amount of HDA primers [71]. It is important that the non-target sequences/organisms have some level of homology with the target to consume the primers. The approach is combined with on-chip hybridization. Only the competitive sequence hybridization is visible under conditions where primers are spent in the competitive amplification before detectable levels of the contaminants are reached. A mathematical expression to calculate the appropriate amount of suppressor is derived and tested against the limit of detection of the target bacteria. As expected, it decreases when increasing the suppressor concentration but it remains below the threshold to trigger clinically relevant blood infection. Although this strategy has some limitations, it can be applied to other DNA amplification schemes.",

In addition, HDA is easy to use, especially when lateral flow devices are used for detection. AmpliVue assays, commercialized by Quidel (proprietary for HDA technology), are small hand-held cartridge based on HDA-lateral flow devices that are considered CLIA moderately complex and are available for the rapid detection of pathogens such as Bordella pertusis, Clostridium difficile, Herpes simples virus, and Trichomonas vaginalis [73] without any other equipment than a heated lid. One of the requirements for a test system to be considered a CLIA-waiver is that it must be run using a specimen that does not require processing [74]. This can be considered another advantage of HDA, which is used for a variety of specimen collections such as vaginal, rectal, or nasopharyngeal swabs with a simple heat treatment for lysing. However, the sample treatment depends on the pathogen/sample analyzed. In food analysis, for example, a culture enrichment step is usually required to reach the legal limits, in many cases absence of the pathogen.",

Closed and disposable devices may contribute to alleviate this problem. The use of a constant temperature of amplification is the origin of another problem, i.e., the non-specific amplification products attributable to mispriming that may lead to false positive. Among isothermal methods, low-temperature amplifications such as RPA (operating at 37 \u00b0C) or LAMP that uses six different primers are more prone to this problem. Conversely, false negatives may arise because test inhibition, especially in complex biological matrices. The nature and amount of potential inhibitors is different in different samples and the concentration at which these inhibitors affect HDA must be empirically obtained. The use of an internal control, as is the case in Solana commercially available assays [75], is a way of minimizing and controlling this problem.
