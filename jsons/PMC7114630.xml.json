The virus is bound to the filter by electrostatic attractive forces, and not by size exclusion. It is possible to get good recoveries of the virus accompanied by good flow rates and a minimum of filter clogging even from turbid waters, and many solids-associated virus can be recovered. In its simplest form, a virus-containing sample is passed under positive pressure or vacuum through a cellulose nitrate membrane 142 or 293 mm in diameter and of mean pore diameter 0.45, 1.2 or 5 \u03bcm (Fig. 1\n). For waters containing particulate material a pre-filter is used upstream of the membrane.",

They were originally used for concentration of viruses from tap water (Jakubowski et al., 1974) and have since been employed for concentration of viruses from river water (e.g. Morris and Waite, 1980) and other waters. Their recoveries are as good as membrane filters, they are less expensive and can be obtained in sterile cartridges in disposable form. However, they are prone to clogging, cannot be used with even moderately turbid water and according to Gerba (1987), cannot be used at high flow rates. Because of problems of clogging of membrane or tube filters, the processing of seawater samples in this way is limited to a maximum of 20 l before filters have to be changed (Block and Schwartzbrod, 1989).",

Initial work was done in the USA by Sobsey and Jones (1979) and by Hou et al. (1980). They adsorb virus in the pH range 3\u20136; at pH values above 7 the adsorption falls off rapidly, so the pH still needs to be carefully controlled. These properties make the use of positively charged filters attractive, not only for the convenience of not having to condition the sample but also because it makes possible the concentration of other viruses such as rotavirus and coliphages, which are sensitive to the low pH conditions needed for adsorption to negatively charged media. Keswick et al (1983) reported that type 1 poliovirus and rotavirus SA11 survived at least 5 weeks on electropositive filters at 4\u00b0C, which makes them useful for on-site concentration. They are used in the same way as electronegative materials. The virus is eluted from the filter and secondary concentration is carried out as for the electronegative types.",

The original positively charged material, Zeta-plus Series S, is made of a cellulose/diatomaceous earth/ion-exchange resin mixture. Sobsey & Glass (1980) compared these Virozorb 1 MDS filters with Filterite (fibreglass) pleated cartridge filters for recovery of poliovirus from 1000 l tap water and obtained recoveries of about 30% with both types. The advantages of these filters lie in the large volumes they can handle without the need for conditioning the sample. Elution from the filter still needs to be carried out at pH 9 or above, which limits their use to viruses stable below that pH, though Bosch et al. (1988) successfully concentrated rotavirus in this way. Organic materials in the sample, especially fulvic acid, were reported to interfere more with virus recovery from Virozorb cartridges than from glass-fibre materials (Sobsey and Hickey, 1985; Guttman-Bass and Catalano-Sherman, 1986). Such filters are used extensively in the USA for concentration of many types of viruses from treated drinking water to sewage effluent (e.g. Sedmak et al., 2005). A different electropositive material (MK) is cheaper but its recoveries were reported to be not as good as 1 MDS in comparative tests (Ma et al., 1994). Improvements to poliovirus and norovirus recovery from tap water samples by coating of electropositive Zetapor filters by passage of AlCl3 prior to filtration was reported by Haramoto et al. (2004).",

Other nylon membranes are also available which are made in various pore sizes, which would permit passage of the virus (0.45, 1.2 and 3 \u03bcm) and have a positive surface charge over the pH range 3\u201310, which would promote strong binding of negatively charged particles. Although nylon filters have been shown to bind viruses in freshwater samples, adsorption from marine samples is very poor and they would not be used for seawater (Sellwood, personal communication). Their low cost and ease of use suggest that further evaluative research should be done.

Most laboratories use membranes or fibre systems with cut-off levels of 30\u2013100 kDa. In systems in which the fluid passes directly through the filter, non-filterable components quickly clog the filter or precipitate at the membrane surface, thus this type of filter is only useful for small volumes (<1000 ml). Some ultrafilters employ tangential flow or vortex flow (VFF), which reduces clogging. Tsai et al. (1993) used VFF for processing inshore water samples in Southern California.

            "text": "Ultracentrifugation is a catch-all method capable of concentrating all viruses in a sample provided sufficient g-force and time are used. Differential ultracentrifugation allows separation of different virus types. A number of studies have been reported, including one in which virus from a polluted well was recovered (Mack et al., 1972), and one where viral numbers in natural waters were as high as 2.5\u00d7108/ ml, 103\u2013107 times as high as had been found by plaque assay (Bergh et al., 1989). However the limited volumes that can be processed, even using continuous flow systems, together with the high capital costs and lack of portability of the equipment, limit its usefulness in concentrating viruses directly from natural waters. It does find a use as a secondary concentration method however. Murphy et al. (1983), in an investigation of a gastroenteritis outbreak associated with polluted drinking water, concentrated 5 l samples of borehole water to 50 ml using an ultrafiltration hollow fibre system and followed this by ultracentrifugation to pellet the virus for electron microscopical examination. They were thus able to detect rapidly rotaviruses, adenoviruses and SRSVs (noroviruses), as well as enteroviruses, which were confirmed by cell culture.",

They found that by normal observation of c.p.e. 15% of cultures were positive, all from source water samples, and that titres ranged from 3.3\u201321 MPN/100 l water. In contrast, MPN by ICC-PCR gave 21% cultures positive and a narrower range of titres for source waters (4.5\u201310.2 MPN/100 l water). Target viruses were also found in the finished and tap waters (0\u20130.9 MPN/100 l). The range of viruses detected by ICC-PCR will be limited by the primers used, and in this study re-resting of the c.p.e.-positive dishes with reovirus-specific primers revealed 89% of cultures positive. The MPN approach can thus be extended beyond the simple scoring of c.p.e.-positive cultures, but the limits of the detection system need to be kept in mind.",

Detection of enteroviruses is a practical proposition since the picornavirus group contains well-conserved nucleotide sequences at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, which are used to prepare pan-enterovirus primers, which are the starting reagents in the PCR. The technique has been extended to cover other virus groups present in water including adenoviruses (Puig et al., 1994), HAVs (Graff et al., 1993), astroviruses (Marx et al., 1995) and rotaviruses (Gajardo et al., 1995).

Higher titres were found in sewage. The Lordsdale strain of norovirus GGII was the most prevalent. Other viruses were also found. This approach to quantitation was extended and supported by statistical estimation by Westrell et al.

Half the well water samples tested were positive for one or more of a range of enteric viruses, though no infectious virus was found.",

Plaque assays on A549 and HEK-293 cultures were negative, suggesting that the viruses detected by quantitative PCR (QPCR) were non-infectious. The group went on to develop a TaqMan\u00ae assay for Ad40 in a variety of environmental samples (Jiang et al., 2005). Pusch et al. (2005) detected a wide range of viruses in samples taken downstream of a waste-water treatment plant. By QPCR they estimated the range of titres of astroviruses to be 3.7\u00d7103\u22121.2\u00d7108 and of noroviruses to be 1.8\u00d7104\u22129.7\u00d7105 \u201cgenome equivalents\u201d per litre. Laverick et al. (2004) devised a QPCR for noroviruses and used it in an in-depth 14-months surveillance of sewage, marine and riverine recreational waters. Absolute quantitation of template was obtained from a standard curve constructed using quantitative standards produced by cloning a modified sequence of the norovirus forward primer. Le Cann et al.

            "text": "Combination of cell culture with PCR has permitted detection of infectious virus even where it normally fails to produce a c.p.e., or where the c.p.e. takes a long time to appear. This technique, integrated cell culture\u2013PCR (ICC-PCR, or ICC/RT-PCR for RNA viruses) has been used by several groups. Reynolds et al. (1996) and Murrin and Slade (1997) inoculated BGM cultures with concentrates and tested the supernatants at intervals up to 10 days. Virus was detectable by RT-PCR as early as 1 day post-inoculation, instead of more than 3 days by normal visualisation of c.p.e. Lee and Jeong (2004) compared ICC\u2013PCR with total culturable virus assay for detection of enteroviruses, adenoviruses and reoviruses in water and found the ICC\u2013(RT)PCR applicable as long as the limitations of the primers used were recognised; Spinner and Di Giovanni (2001) applied the technique to reovirus detection in drinking water sources. Jiang et al. (2004), investigating HAV in water, refined the technique in developing an integrated cell culture/strand-specific RT-PCR procedure capable of distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious HAV in spiked water samples. This involved initial propagation of infectious virus in cell culture followed by detection of the negative-strand RNA of the replicative intermediate using strand-specific RT-PCR. Greening et al. (2002) were able to detect naturally-occurring infectious enteroviruses and infectious adenoviruses in three days and five days respectively by ICC-(RT)PCR, compared with five days and 10 days if plaque assays or immunofluorescence were used. Cromeans et al. (2004) used a similar approach for the detection of HAV in water. The detection of the double-stranded replicative form of RNA viruses in cultured cells permits the conclusion that the virus is actually replicating and that it is not the sample inoculum which is being detected.",

This is particularly a useful approach in the detection of adenoviruses in water sample concentrates, particularly Ad40 and 41, which do not produce a clear c.p.e. Adenoviruses have a high particle/infectious virion ratio in culture (Brown et al., 1992), which is important when estimating the infectious viruses in a sample. Ko et al. (2003) developed a method for detection of infectious Ads2 and 41 in culture by detecting virus-specific mRNA, which is only produced during virus replication. The mRNA of Ad2 was detected as soon as 6 h after infection, and of Ad41 as soon as 24 h after infection of A549 cell cultures. This is in contrast to the development of up to 10 days for environmental isolates of \u201cculturable\u201d adenoviruses and several weeks (if at all) for the growth of Ad41 in culture. The group went on to develop the technique for use in detecting Ads in water sample concentrates and found they could detect as little as two infectious units (IU) Ad2 and 10 IU Ad41 in sample concentrates inoculated into cell cultures (Cromeans et al., 2004).",
