Coal, oil, and gas and later nuclear energy fueled the economic growth that brought wealth to Europe and North America and more recently to China and East Asia. For many decades coal miners were organized in labor unions that defined regional and at times national politics. Oil and gas companies (Sinopec, Royal Dutch Shell, China National Petroleum, Saudi Aramco, BP, Exxon Mobil ...) continue to be among the wealthiest companies in the world. Fossil fuel wealth has also helped to keep a narrative alive that fossil fuel and nuclear energy is essential for the well-being of modern societies, that fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants are essential for maintaining grid stability and preventing blackouts, and that a rapid transition away from fossil fuels would wreak havoc on economic systems.",

This is important not only for Germany but also for Europe as Germany is the largest economy within the European Union with an export-oriented manufacturing sector. After the Fukushima nuclear accident, Germany made a renewed decision to phase-out nuclear energy while phasing in renewable energy. The last of the country's nuclear power plants is to be shut down in 2022, ending a more than 80-year history of nuclear energy in the country. In the meantime, renewable energy has expanded dramatically, now accounting for around 40% of electricity generation. Likely to miss its 2020 target for greenhouse gas emission reductions, new targets have been set for the years ahead: 55% reduction by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. To achieve this, the country aims at further expansion of renewables, strong energy efficiency improvements, reforestation and afforestation projects, clean technology development, hydrogen fuel and electric mobility, improved battery storage technologies, the retrofitting of buildings, resource efficiency, recycling and reuse, and changes to agricultural policy. The concepts of ecological modernization and the sustainable development goals are strongly engrained in the country. Efforts to transition the economy in more ecologically sound directions have been on-going for decades.",

Efforts to introduce more reflective governance structures have been made. A stakeholder committee was set up to advise the government on how best to phase out of coal in a socially just manner leading to a plan to shut down the last coal fired power plants by around 2038. Commonly known as the Coal Commission, the committee's official name, \"the Commission for Growth, Structural Change, and Employment\", speaks for itself about the importance placed not only on the main goal of the committee-to phase out coal for climate protection, but the need to address areas of great concern to those who will be impacted directly by the energy and economic transition. With the rise of the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) and rumblings in the economic wing of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and within the Christian Social Union (CSU), those supporting a rapid energy transition are beginning to recognize the need to more strongly link environmental and climate protection to questions of social and environmental justice both within and between generations. With the rise of populism, this tendency has intensified as environmentalists are beginning to recognize that their environmental and climate policies are only likely to succeed if they are perceived as socially just.",

We'll put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, modernizing schools that are failing our children, and building wind farms and solar panels, fuel-efficient cars and the alternative energy technologies that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil and keep our economy competitive in the years ahead\" (Obama 2008) . In 2018, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey respectively launched Green New Deal Resolutions in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate calling for radical cuts in carbon emissions to achieve carbon neutrality \"through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers\" while creating millions of good, high-wage jobs and investing in the country's infrastructure and industry. The Resolution submitted to the House calls for a switch to 100% renewable energy, upgrading existing buildings in terms of their overall efficiency, and working with farmers and ranchers to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector (H. Res. 109). While their initiatives have next to no chance of gaining sufficient support to pass in Congress, they are capturing the imagination of other actors.",

The European Union under Commissioner Ursula Von der Leyen has issued a European Green Deal (European Commission 2019). The European Green Deal has as its main goals reaching climate neutrality by 2050, developing a more sustainable economic system, and improving the wellbeing of people. It addresses the areas of clean energy, sustainable industry, building renovation, sustainable mobility, food production and consumption, biodiversity protection and eliminating pollution all together. Among many other plans, industry is to be incentivized to use more recycled materials in its production processes and more public transportation offerings are to be made and mobility to be decarbonized. As material extraction for the production of goods contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and waste, and only 12% of materials used in industry today are recycled, this is another area of focus. Numerous plans are in development, including an industrial and digitalization strategy, which will also aim at furthering the shift towards sustainability. In the coming months many regulations and directives tied to the Green New Deal can be expected. While there is general consensus in the European Union on the importance of tackling climate change, there is only a weak agreement in relation to achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century. The real test of this policy will be in the coming decades as Green Deal policies become more concrete and need to be implemented.",

Whereas in the 1990s, the dominant narrative was that pollution was an inevitable consequence of economic development and that as a developing country, China should not be expected to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, since the 2010s, the narrative has changed. President Xi Jinping has prioritized the improvement of ecological conditions, green development and reduction of environmental pollution. These are seen as critical to achieving China's goal of becoming an \"all round well-off society\" (Xiaokang society) by 2020, achieving a basic modern economy and ecological civilization by 2035, and obtaining the status of a wealthy and \"Beautiful PRC\" by mid-century. The idea of an 'ecological civilization' appeared first around 2007 in a report to the 17th National People's Congress (Chun 2015) . In 2013 Chinese President Xi Jinpeng stated that the environment should not be sacrificed for temporary economic growth. He pledged to establish an ecological \"red line\" requiring all levels of government to assure that industrial development occurs within the constraints of natural conditions. \"We have to understand that to protect the environment is to preserve our productivity and to improve the environment is to develop our productivity. Such concepts should be deeply rooted\" (\"President Xi pledges not to sacrifice environment,\" China Daily, May 24, 2013). Arthur Hanson (2019) describes the concept of 'ecological civilization' as a \"a philosophy, vision, and compass for a green and prosperous future\" that was enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 2018 and has its roots in the 12th and 13th Five Year Plans. Expectations are that the 14th Five Year Plan will further the promotion of renewable energies, energy efficiency, green consumerism, a transition to low-carbon mobility, healthy and safe food, and a circular economy. Indeed, such a transition will be essential if China is to deal with the environmental degradation caused by its increasingly welloff population with a middle class of about 400 million (Cyrill 2019). On March 11, 2020 the powerful National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Justice released \"Opinions Concerning Accelerating the Establishment of Regulation and Policy System on Green Production and Consumption,\" which is to lead to new regulations by 2025. These include plans for ramping up cleaner energy production, smart grids, energy storage technology, and distributed energy as well as hydrogen fuel and marine energy. In addition, the opinion discusses whole-cycle and whole-chain cleaner coal exploitation and utilization.",

All indicators are that much more must be done to change course to slow global warming. And new challenges are emerging as I write this piece. The shock of the Corona Virus on the global economy will be huge and it will certainly impact many policy decisions and growth trajectories. What this will mean for the struggle between different energy trajectories and climate change visions is an open question.",

So we have now replaced that with the concept of ecological civilization where man exists in harmony with nature ... So we have clearly concluded that we have to change our development model to a green, circular, and low carbon model.
