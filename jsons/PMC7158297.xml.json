The urinary bladder should be emptied before performing paracentesis. Infiltrate a small area with a local anesthetic, if desired. Use a 20- to 22-gauge needle or over-the-needle catheter to penetrate the abdomen. Attempt to obtain fluid in four quadrants, allowing the fluid to flow freely by gravity and capillary action. If needed, gentle suction with a 3- or 6-mL syringe can be employed. For a complete description of the technique, the reader is referred elsewhere (Walters, 2003). Allow the animal to rest quietly while fluid is being removed. Moving the animal or allowing the patient to move while the needle is in the abdomen can result in laceration or puncture of organs. Some investigators prefer to have the patient standing for fluid removal; however, it is more likely that the omentum will occlude the needle in this position.",

This technique is identical to that described above; however, a catheter is employed over a needle. After removing the stylet, 10 to 20 mL/kg of warmed isotonic fluids are introduced via an IV fluid set. The animal is then gently rolled from side to side, walked briefly, and massaged to distribute the fluid throughout the abdomen. The sample is then obtained using the four-quadrant approach. Detailed descriptions of this technique can be found elsewhere (Walters, 2003). Using the DPL technique doubles the accuracy of a straight needle abdominocentesis (Crowe, 1984). A significant drawback of using this technique is the undeterminable effect of dilution on the total nucleated cell count and total protein.",

            "text": "Note the color and character of the fluid initially upon removal (Fig. 6-1\n). If the fluid is clear initially and then turns red, iatrogenic blood contamination is likely. Conversely, if a sample is red throughout collection, a hemorrhagic fluid should be suspected. The fluid should be collected into both a lavender-top tube (EDTA anticoagulant) for evaluation of nucleated cells and red blood cells. A portion of the sample should also be placed in a red-top tube (or any sterile tube without additives) for biochemical assays such as potassium, creatinine, lactate, and glucose. Finally, a portion of the fluid should be placed in a sterile tube for aerobic, anaerobic, mycoplasma, and fungal cultures. Samples intended for culture should not be refrigerated and should be processed within 24 hours of obtaining. Tubes that contain EDTA should not be used for bacterial culture because EDTA is bacteriostatic (Songer and Post, 2005). For cytologic examination, make both a direct nonconcentrated smear by a squash or blood film spread technique and smears from the pellet of a centrifuged sample using either a blood film spread or squash technique. Samples can be spun for 3 to 5 minutes at 450 g (approximately 1500 to 2000 rpm) to obtain the pellet. From the resulting supernatant, a total protein should be measured by refractometry. The remaining pellet is reconstituted using an equal amount of remaining liquid by flicking the tube with a finger or using a stir stick. A small amount of unspun fluid may additionally be placed in a cytocentrifuge if available, and a cytospin preparation be produced for improved visibility of cytoplasmic features. Methanolic Romanowsky stains such as Wright stain or an aqueous Romanowsky stain can be applied to a few slides for immediate in-house evaluation. The remaining unstained smears and an EDTA and serum tube filled with fluid may be submitted to the laboratory for diagnostic confirmation. Maher et al (2010) showed that after 24 and 48 hours of storage, there is a significant decrease in the total nucleated cell count, a decrease in the number of neutrophils and neoplastic cells, and an increase in the number of unrecognizable cells. In addition, bacteria that were seen in fresh samples were no longer found at 24 and 48 hours (Maher et al., 2010). Whenever possible, the tubes should be sent overnight on ice to prevent in vitro changes along with freshly prepared slides. This will allow the clinical pathologist evaluating the sample to compare the cellularity and appearance of the cells in the sample submitted with those in the tube at the time of collection.",

Both methods offer accurate readings in a wide range of protein concentrations (Braun et al., 2001, George, 2001, George and O\u2019Neill, 2001). It has been shown with canine effusions that refractometry underestimates the protein content when the concentration is less than 2.0 g/dL, and that spectrophotometry using the biuret method is more accurate when there is high protein content (Braun et al., 2001). Others have found that refractometry can be used accurately down to 1.0 g/dL (George and O\u2019Neill, 2001). A similar finding of underestimating the protein content in feline effusions with refractometry may also occur (Papasouliotis et al., 2002). In that same study, a dry chemistry analyzer produced increased globulin concentration and therefore lower albumin:globulin (A:G) ratios when compared with a reference wet analyzer using the same biuret and bromocresol green methodologies. This finding is particularly important because decreased A:G ratios support a diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (Hartmann et al., 2003, Shelly et al., 1988). A recent study (Hetzel et al., 2012) showed acceptable results for total protein were produced using a VetScan table top analyzer, whereas the VetTest and SpotChem analyzers were determined to be unacceptable for evaluating total protein in canine effusions.",

The lavender-top tube contains anticoagulant, which prevents the sample from clotting if there is a high protein content.

Similarly, estimation of leukocyte cell counts can be performed for overall evaluation from well-made direct smears. Each microscope differs in magnification, but often the estimate can be accomplished by counting nucleated cells from an average field in the monolayer and multiplying the count by the square of the lens objective. For example, using the 40\u00d7 objective, the average presence of 6 cells/field \u00d7 1600 (402) = 9600/\u03bcL. The Sysmex XT-2000iV provides a rapid, precise, and accurate TNCC (Pinta da Cunha, 2009).

The accumulation of a transudate in a body cavity causes increased pressure, which is irritating to the mesothelial cells lining the space. They respond by proliferating and sloughing into the effusion. With time, the sloughed mesothelial cells die and in so doing release chemoattractants that draw small numbers of phagocytes into the effusion to remove cellular debris. The result is a mild increase in both total protein (greater than 2.5 g/dL) and nucleated cell count (less than 5000/\u03bcL). Thus, modified transudates are generally transudates that have been present long enough to elicit a mild inflammatory reaction (Fig. 6-7B). They are most often associated with cardiovascular disease (Fig. 6-8) or neoplastic conditions; however, posthepatic, postsinusoidal, and sinusoidal portal hypertension usually presents with a modified transudate abdominal effusion (Buob, 2011).",

The gross appearance of these fluids is the result of high lipid content (due to higher cholesterol content than serum) but is in no way related to a true chylous effusion, because there are no triglycerides or chylomicrons present (Fossum et al., 1986b, Hillerdal, 1997, Meadows and MacWilliams, 1994). The phagocytes attracted to remove cellular debris from transudates are rich in enzymes that digest protein but are virtually devoid of enzymes that will break down complex lipids. Consequently, while most of the constituents of dying cells are removed by phagocytosis, lipid content of the cells simply accumulates in the effusion. Effusions formed in this manner are easily distinguished cytologically from true chylous effusions (Fossum et al., 1986b).",

Because of the ability of mesothelial cells to respond to irritation by proliferation, the presence of increased numbers of mesothelial cell clusters and rafts is a common finding in reactivity (Fig. 6-4B). Mitoses are increased, and occasional multinucleated reactive mesothelial cells are seen. Reactive mesothelial cells in clusters are capable of imbibing lipid from the effusion fluid, and when they do, they take on the characteristics of secretory cells. In this form they must be differentiated from metastatic adenocarcinoma or mesothelioma. This may be done by critically evaluating the cell populations for criteria of malignancy. However, differentiation between neoplasia and mesothelial hyperplasia can be occasionally challenging to the less experienced, and a second opinion is recommended.",

One method used to distinguish transudates or modified transudates from exudates is measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in canine effusions (Parra et al., 2006). A CRP level of 4 \u03bcg/mL could be used to reliably differentiate transudates from exudates, whereas a level of 11 \u03bcg/mL could be used to differentiate modified transudates from exudates. Zoia et al (2009) advocate using a combination of variables, including lactate dehydrogenase and protein ratios, in feline pleural effusions and the serum to distinguish transudate from exudate by applying a set of criteria adopted from human medicine.

If neutrophils are degenerate, an effort should be made to identify bacterial organisms within phagocytes (primarily neutrophils). This is generally easiest at the feathered edge of the smear. If organisms are not seen, the fluid should still be cultured. Mixed and macrophagic inflammatory effusions reflect less severe irritation and are found with resolving acute effusions or in association with less irritating etiologic agents than bacteria (e.g., fungal organisms or foreign bodies).

FIP has been noted to cause 18% of pleural (Davies and Forrester, 1996), 9.8% of pericardial (Davidson et al., 2008), and 5% of abdominal (Wright, 1999) effusions. Classification as an inflammatory effusion is based primarily on the presence of high total protein (often greater than 4.5 g/dL), which is a reflection of a similar elevation in serum protein, as well as the product of vasculitis and increased vascular permeability. Cytologically these fluids are usually relatively low in cell number (1000 to 30,000/\u03bcL) and inconsistent with regard to the cell types present. In a majority of cases the predominant cell is the nondegenerate neutrophil (Fig. 6-14A\n). However, activated macrophages are commonly observed (Fig. 6-14B) (Norris et al., 2005, Paltrinieri et al., 1999). In rare cases the lymphocyte is prevalent and the effusion can even appear chyle-like (Savary et al., 2001). Regardless of the predominant cell type, slides in all cases have a bluish-gray to purple granular background that results from the high protein content (Fig. 6-14A&B), and clumps and strands of fibrin may be observed.",

In the more chronic reactions, there is generally a significant reactive mesothelial cell component to the response. A striking feature of the inflammatory response is the morphology of neutrophils. Whereas most cases of septic pleuritis and peritonitis are signaled by the presence of predominantly degenerating neutrophils, in nocardial and actinomycotic effusions the majority of the neutrophils away from the organisms are nondegenerate or show signs of aging (hypersegmentation) or apoptosis (karyorrhexis and/or pyknosis). Degenerating neutrophils are only seen immediately in the vicinity of the bacterial organisms because these agents, in contrast to most other bacteria, produce only weak local toxins. The net effect of this phenomenon is that smears in these cases may be easily misinterpreted as noninfectious, particularly if the organisms are not widespread. Because the particles seen grossly often are composed of bacterial colonies, it is important that squash preparations of these particles be examined to ensure that the diagnosis is not missed (Fig. 6-15B&C). In addition, the feathered edge of blood film smears should also be carefully examined because small colonies may be dragged to the edge.",

Etiologies such as gastric dilatation and volvulus, cholelithiasis, gunshot wounds, and iatrogenic secondary to fine needle aspiration or surgery have all been reported. In addition, it is an infrequent accompaniment to diaphragmatic hernia from any cause in the dog and cat. When the results of direct trauma are mainly in the biliary system, leakage of bile is virtually always restricted to the peritoneal cavity, with a resulting peritonitis. When associated with diaphragmatic hernia, leakage of bile occurs when liver is trapped in the diaphragmatic rent and there is rupture or necrosis of the gall bladder or common bile duct. In this circumstance, both peritonitis and pleuritis can result. Bile is a very irritating substance; its presence quickly elicits an inflammatory response. Grossly, the fluid may be initially brown (Fig. 6-1G) to yellow to greenish; however, as the response becomes more and more cellular, this discoloration may become masked. Large volumes of fluid can usually be obtained. Based on physical characteristics, these effusions are usually exudates (Ludwig et al., 1997, Owens et al., 2003).",

In reactions of greater duration, bile granules may have all been converted to rhomboidal to amorphous golden crystals of bile pigment. When such crystals are found in the cytoplasm of effusion phagocytes in the absence of evidence of prior hemorrhage (e.g., erythrophagocytosis), the possibility of bilious effusion should be strongly considered. In addition to the typical appearance of bilious effusions, acellular, amorphous, fibrillar blue-grey mucinous material (Fig. 6-18A-D\n) has been associated with biliary tree rupture, particularly of the common bile duct in dogs (Owens et al., 2003). Accumulations of this extracellular material are the predominant cytologic finding in contrast to the more typical green or yellow bile granules. It is suspected that this bile-free material is produced by biliary and gallbladder epithelium as a consequence to extrahepatic biliary obstruction with regurgitation of normal bile into hepatic lymph and venous blood.

            "text": "Uroperitoneum in cats and dogs is frequently seen secondary to a ruptured bladder, although compromise of any of the urinary tract that lies within the peritoneal cavity can produce uroperitoneum. The most common cause of a ruptured bladder is trauma (Aumann et al., 1998, Burrows and Bovee, 1974). Sources of trauma include blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., vehicular), aggressive catheterization or aggressive palpation/expression. Urine in the peritoneal space results in chemical irritation. The protein content and total nucleated cell count may be variable as a result of dilution from the urine. Early in the condition, a mononuclear cell population may predominate, suggestive of a modified transudate. Later the neutrophil is usually the predominant cell type as effusion becomes an exudate (Fig. 6-2). Bacteria may or may not be present. Neutrophils exposed to the irritant material may show karyorrhexis, pyknosis, or karyolysis with ragged nuclear borders (Fig. 6-19A-C\n). In some cases urinary crystals are found on cytologic examination, which supports the diagnosis of uroperitoneum. In cats the creatinine and potassium concentrations in the effusion were found to be higher than serum concentrations (generally a ratio of 2:1) (Aumann et al., 1998). A higher effusion creatinine concentration vs. serum creatinine concentration tends to persist longer than a higher effusion urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration vs. serum BUN concentration because creatinine equilibrates more slowly than urea nitrogen. One study found that 85% of dogs with uroperitoneum had an abdominal fluid:serum creatinine ratio greater than 2:1 (all of these dogs had an effusion creatinine concentration that was four times the serum concentration), and 100% had an abdominal fluid:serum potassium greater than 1.4:1 (Schmiedt et al., 2001). In addition, serum Na:K also tends to be decreased in cases of uroabdomen (Aumann et al., 1998, Burrows and Bovee, 1974). Cases of urothorax have been described in a dog and a cat (Klainbart et al., 2011, St\u00f6rk et al., 2003).",

            "text": "In a small number of dogs with ascites, often from western North America, the etiology is aberrant cestodiasis associated with Mesocestoides infection (Caruso et al., 2003, Crosbie et al., 1998, Patten et al., 2013, Stern et al., 1987). This disease has been termed canine peritoneal larval cestodiasis, or CPLC (Patten et al., 2013). Pleural involvement has also been reported (Toplu et al., 2004). Rare reports of infection involve cats (Eleni et al., 2007, Jabbar et al., 2012, Venco et al., 2005). Peritoneal aspirates from anorexic, ascitic dogs have the gross appearance of tapioca pudding or cream of wheat (Fig. 6-20A\n). Motile cestodes can be seen in fluid with the unaided eye. Microscopically, the fluid is usually a suppurative exudate (Caruso et al., 2003); however, eosinophilic inflammation has also been described (Patten et al., 2013). Microscopic examination may also show acephalic metacestodes or acoelomic tissue with calcareous corpuscles (Fig. 6-20B), which may be seen in nonspecific cestode infections. Less often seen microscopically are metacestodes with visible tetrathyridia, a unique larval form having four suckers that represents the asexual reproductive form of Mesocestoides spp. infection (Fig. 6-20CC). Cestode ova are not usually found in the feces (Crosbie et al., 1998). Molecular testing is necessary for identification of the different Mesocestoides species (Crosbie et al., 2000). Cases of this parasitic disease have been reported in Italy, Germany, and Japan (Bonfanti et al., 2004, Kashiide et al., 2014, Wirtherle et al., 2007). See Appendix for more images.",

            "text": "Chyle is a mixture of lymph and chylomicrons. Triglyceride-rich chylomicrons are derived from dietary lipids processed in the intestine and transported via lymphatics. Historically, chylous effusions were thought to be primarily a result of thoracic duct rupture. It is now known that there are a variety of causes for chylous effusions and that rupture of the thoracic duct is uncommon. Causes for chylous effusions in the thoracic cavity include cardiovascular disease, neoplasia (e.g., lymphoma, thymoma, and lymphangiosarcoma), heartworm disease, diaphragmatic hernia (Kerpsack et al., 1994), lung torsion, mediastinal fungal granulomas, chronic coughing, vomiting, primary lymphedema, iatrogenic, or idiopathic (Forrester et al., 1991, Fossum et al., 1986a, Fossum et al., 1991, Fossum, 1993, Mclane and Buote, 2011, Meakin et al., 2013, Neath et al., 2000, Schuller et al., 2011, Singh and Brisson, 2010, Small et al., 2008, Waddle and Giger, 1990). In one study (Fossum et al., 1986a), Afghan Hounds appeared to have a higher incidence of chylothorax than other breeds of dogs. This may be due to Afghans being overrepresented in cases of lung lobe torsion (Neath et al., 2000). Purebred cats were overrepresented in a 1991 retrospective study by Fossum et al. Chylous pleural effusions are more prevalent in cats (30.5%) than dogs (18.9%) (Davies and Forrester, 1996, Mellanby et al., 2002); however, the prevalence of chylothorax in the Mellanby study may be underestimated as mediastinal effusions were also included in that study. Chylomediastinum has not been described in animals.",

Chylous effusions have a triglyceride concentration that is greater than the serum triglycerides concentration; often the effusion:serum ratio is greater than 3:1 (Fossum et al., 1986b, Meadows and MacWilliams, 1994). In addition, a cholesterol-to-triglyceride (C:T) ratio of less than one was proposed to be characteristic of a chylous effusion (Fossum et al., 1986b). However, another study found it to be less reliable (Waddle and Giger, 1990). Based on lipoprotein electrophoretic studies, pleural chylous effusions can be better identified by fluid triglyceride concentrations greater than 100 mg/dL and nonchylous effusions by concentrations less than 100 mg/dL (Waddle and Giger, 1990).",

Malignant neoplasia was the final diagnosis in 68.3% to 80% of canine cases of acute nontraumatic hemoperitoneum (Aronsohn et al., 2009, Pintar et al., 2003). Of them, 63.3% to 88% were determined to be hemangiosarcoma. Other causes of canine hemoperitoneum include hematomas, torsion (liver and splenic), and coagulopathies such as rodenticide intoxication (Aronsohn et al., 2009, Beal et al., 2008, Pintar et al., 2003). Similar studies in cats implicate malignant neoplasia as the etiology in feline hemoperitoneum in 44% to 46% of cases (Culp et al., 2010, Mandell and Drobatz, 1995). Hemangiosarcoma comprised 28% and 60% of these tumors. Other etiologies include coagulopathies, hepatic necrosis, ruptured urinary bladder, hepatic torsion, hepatic rupture secondary to amyloidosis, and FIP-associated lesions of the liver and kidney (Culp et al., 2010, Mandell and Drobatz, 1995, Swann and Brown, 2001).",

Hemorrhagic effusions do not contain platelets; if observed, an indication that the effusion was contaminated by peripheral blood during collection.

One report involving five dogs suggested that mesotheliomas can arise in dogs secondary to chronic idiopathic pericardial hemorrhage (Machida et al., 2004). Cytologically, mesothelioma is extremely challenging to differentiate from carcinoma or marked reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. Mesothelioma cells are generally round to slightly polygonal in shape and are arranged primarily in clusters; however, spindle shapes have also been observed. This variation in cytomorphology likely arises from the multiple histologic subtypes, including a granular cell morphology, deciduoid (Morini et al., 2006), epithelioid (Leisewitz and Nesbit, 1992), cystic, sclerosing (Geninet et al., 2003), and even a lipid-rich form (Avakian et al., 2008). Nuclei are hyperchromic and located centrally. Often nuclei of adjacent cells within a cluster appear to press against each other resulting in deformation of nuclei (nuclear molding). Because of the difficulty of differentiating mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, caution must be used when evaluating suspect populations for criteria of malignancy. As with effusions associated with carcinomas, at least five strong nuclear criteria of malignancy must be seen before a presumptive diagnosis is made. When there is still cytologic ambivalence, a second opinion is recommended, especially related to the variable cytologic morphology of mesothelioma (Figure 6-33, Figure 6-34, Figure 6-35\n).\n",

The pericardial effusion is often associated with moderate to marked mesothelial hyperplasia, which mimics carcinoma cells. The mesothelial cells are very large with dark basophilic cytoplasm and are often binucleated with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 6-4B). Mitotic figures that are occasionally bizarre may mimic carcinoma. Consequently, cytology often cannot reliably differentiate mesothelial cell hyperplasia from neoplasia. Unlike hemangiosarcoma, which may cause pericardial hemorrhage and exfoliate large individualized neoplastic endothelial cells, other neoplasms of mesenchymal origin typically do not shed neoplastic cells into effusions. To underscore the difficulty in diagnosis, 74% of 19 neoplastic effusions were not detected with cytology and 13% of 31 nonneoplastic effusions were falsely reported as neoplastic. In another study that evaluated 47 pericardial effusions, cytology identified the cause in only six (12.8%); five were infectious and one was lymphoma (MacDonald et al., 2009). Interestingly, when PCV of the fluid was less than 10%, a cytologic diagnosis was made in 20.3% vs. only 7.7% when PCV was greater than 10% (Cagle et al., 2014).",
