However, it has also become clear that frame maintenance during translation is not absolute Atkins et al 1991, Kurland 1992, Parker 1989. In addition to the inherent accuracy limits of the ribosome in maintaining frame, shifts can be promoted by mutant tRNAs and can occur with high frequency at \u201cprogrammed\u201d sites in mRNA. Frameshifts can be stimulated by such elements as upstream rRNA-binding motifs, stem-loop structures and underused codons. Indeed, these programmed shifts can be critical to protein production, e.g. the gag-pol polyprotein of Rous Sarcoma virus, the Ty1 and Ty3 elements of yeast, the dnaX gene of DNA Pol III tau and gamma units, and the self-regulating RF2 protein in Escherichia coli\n(Gesteland et al., 1992).",

(Note that we adopt the convention herein of writing both codon and anticodon sequences in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction.) These experiments conclusively demonstrated that certain tRNAs with extended anticodons can read non-triplet codons. Most of the known four-base codon suppressors have subsequently been isolated from Salmonella or yeast and are largely single-base insertion mutants of tRNAPro, tRNAGly or tRNALys reading CCCX, GGGX or AAAX, where it is not always known which X can be read. The known four-base codon suppressors tend to act with efficiencies from very poor to approaching 20 % (Atkins et al., 1991).",

For example, when the suppression of GGGN codons by tRNAs bearing NCCC anticodons (SUF16 derivatives) was analyzed, it was found that the only non-functional N:N pair was G:G. This result indicates that Watson-Crick pairing at the fourth codon nucleotide is even less strictly enforced than at the third \u201cwobble\u201d position for normal codons. However, the identity of the N:N pair does affect suppression efficiency, and canonical pairings in the fourth position gave the strongest suppression (Gaber & Culbertson, 1984). Additionally, it has been found that sufJ, a modified tRNAThr with anticodon UGGU, is capable of decoding ACCC and ACCU in addition to ACCA (ACCG was not tested; Bossi & Roth, 1981).",

While the canonical pairs tended to suppress well, some non-canonical pairs were also efficient. For example, the best pair arose from a CCUA anticodon and a UAGA codon; also, the GCUA tRNA preferred UAGA and UAGG to its canonical UAGC. The ability to read a four-base codon versus a three-base codon for these extended-anticodon tRNAs was also assessed, by using tRNAs that decode four-base codons whose first three bases encode a stop codon. In this case there is no competitive translation with a canonical tRNA. In general, four-base decoding predominated when a fourth Watson-Crick pair was possible and was less likely to predominate otherwise. The authors proposed that this is a consequence of mRNA-induced stabilization of a tRNA conformation that favors four-base decoding, possible only when a fourth canonical base-pair is present (Curran & Yarus, 1987).",

(1998) have proposed that, at least in some cases, extended-anticodon tRNAs merely render the tRNA less capable of three-base decoding and in the process make room for other tRNAs to promiscuously interact with the codon by a slippage mechanism. For example in Salmonella, mutant tRNAPro with a GGGG anticodon is methylated in such a way (underlined G37) that pairing with the mRNA cytosine is obstructed. Apparently, the tRNAPro with cmo5UGG anticodon, which typically reads CCA, CCG and CCU, can read CCC in the absence of its normal cognate tRNAGGG, but favors slippage since there are only two canonical base-pairs.",

Two types of libraries were generated: four-base codon reporters and tRNA suppressors (Figure 1). The reporter system involved replacement of a conserved (S70) or permissive (S124) codon in the gene for \u03b2-lactamase with four random nucleotides. These libraries, which each contain 44=256 unique members, bear an insertion mutation at the site of interest, producing an inactive enzyme as a result of the frame alteration that renders transformed bacteria incapable of survival on ampicillin. To our surprise, however, approximately 0.5 % of the members of these reporter libraries survived on moderate to high concentrations of ampicillin (100-2000 \u03bcg ml\u22121). Invariably, sequencing of these clones showed that the \u03b2-lactamase genes contained only three nucleotides at the sites of interest, corresponding to Ser and Cys at the conserved S70 site and corresponding to all amino acids except Cys, Met, Pro, Trp and Tyr at the permissive S124 site (although this is probably largely due to undersampling of three-base sequence space, since the amount of contamination was small). Presumably, these \u201cdeletion\u201d mutants, which occur at rates much higher than the 10\u22126 upper-limit estimated for deletion in vivo\n(Cupples et al., 1990), are the result of inefficiency in the coupling and capping reactions employed during synthesis of the oligonucleotides used to generate the libraries.",

In each case, suppression at the highest levels was mediated by a tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon (Table 4). Interestingly, the sequences external to the anticodon (i.e. the two nucleotides on either side of the anticodon) converged on different sequences depending upon the anticodon. To examine the effect of sequence variation in the anticodon loop outside of the anticodon per se, tRNAs from the tRNASer(N8) library were selected at different levels of ampicillin (20 \u03bcg ml\u22121 to 1500 \u03bcg ml\u22121) against a single reporter codon at S124 (Table 5). For this experiment, we selected the most efficiently suppressed codon (AGGA) to examine the widest array of suppression efficiency. At 1500 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ampicillin, the sequences converged on MUUCCUAM, where M=A or C. At 300 \u03bcg ml\u22121, the convergence was reduced to NBUCCURN, where B=C or G or U and R=A or G. At 20 mg/ml, the consensus was reduced to NNNCCUDN, where D=A or G or U, with loss of canonical recognition of the fourth base of the codon but maintenance of the other three bases. This allows us to rank the different anticodon positions in importance for suppression efficiency: Watson-Crick complementarity to the first three bases of the codon is most critical, followed by complementarity at the fourth base, the presence of a purine at position 37 (3\u2032 to the anticodon) and the presence of a U at position 33 (5\u2032 to the anticodon).",

However, in this assay, the very-efficient supD suppressor of the amber stop codon exhibited virtually the same \u03b2-lactamase activity as observed in cells with AGT (Ser) at the S124 site. This may indicate that it is possible to saturate the amount of \u03b2-lactamase that is exported to the periplasm in this system. Therefore, while the activities allow us to compare frameshift efficiencies, we cannot strictly correlate these activity data with suppression efficiencies as compared to translation of wild-type \u03b2-lactamase.",

Strikingly, each of these four-base codons has a tandem repeat in the central two nucleotides (a purine repeat in one case). It is also noteworthy that some of the best suppressed codons (e.g. AGGC, CGGN and CGAU) but not all of them (e.g. AGGA) are among this shifty set. For some codons (e.g. AGGN, AAAN, and GGGN), only a subset of the family is present, indicating that slipping at a particular three-base codon is strongly influenced by the base that follows. Some of these, such as AGGA, are probably only slightly less shifty (5 \u03bcg ml\u22121), but it becomes difficult to examine libraries at this low level of selection due to background survival of satellites on ampicillin.",

However, a number of exceptions, like ACCN and UAGN, were later found or engineered (Atkins et al., 1991). Among those efficient suppressors identified in this study, it is clear that there is no sequence pattern that generally underlies efficient four-base suppression. For example, CUAG is completely non-repetitive, and GGGG, AAAA and UUUU are not among the best suppressors. However, the most efficiently suppressed four-base codons correspond to three-base codons (plus one 3\u2032 nucleotide) with low usage and low tRNA abundance in E. coli\n(Table 9). For example, AGG is the least used codon in the E. coli genome (Inokuchi & Yamao, 1995). Nevertheless, the best suppressors do not simply correspond to the least represented tRNAs or codons, since we found no robust suppressors of highly underrepresented codons AGAN, AUAN or CGAN. Also, among randomly selected codons that vary in usage from overrepresented (AAUG and UUCU) to moderate representation (ACGC) to underrepresented (GGAU and CGGA), and that lack any evident sequence pattern, weak to moderate suppressors could be found (Table 9). Of course, the procedure employed here selects for growth on ampicillin and therefore requires both an efficient four-base codon/tRNA interaction and a lack of toxicity to the cell. We cannot rule out the possibility of efficient but toxic suppressors of highly represented four-base codons.",

However, CUAG is apparently a completely novel efficiently suppressed four-base codon, consistent with the fact that CTAG is underrepresented in the bacterial genome (Burge et al., 1992). These suppressors acted with efficiencies of 2.5\u201335 % of the maximum activity detectable with a nitrocefin-based assay (AGU or supD/UAG), which is consistent with activities from the most efficient natural and engineered suppressors known. Also, fairly efficient suppressors for the four-base codons CUAC, CCAU, UCAA, CCUU and CUCU were found Table 1, Table 4. Examination of the anticodon loop sequences shows that the best tRNAs for each codon have a canonical anticodon, but the rest of the loop does not necessarily converge on the sequence consensus observed in E. coli tRNAs. For example, the tRNA that suppresses CUAG has G33 and G37 instead of U33 and A37, and the tRNA that suppresses CCCU has a U37. (See Figure 1 for numbering of nucleotides in the 8 nt and 9 nt anticodon loops.) Presumably, these mutations adjust the loop conformation to allow maximally favorable interaction between the codon and anticodon, which is quite possibly different from the most favorable conformation for a three-base anticodon. These data support a model in which the extended-codon tRNA directly reads all four bases of the codon (as opposed to a slippage model), since (1) the most efficient suppressors invariably had Watson-Crick complementarity at all four bases of the codon, (2) the suppression at S70 required insertion of a serine or cysteine residue, demonstrating that the modified tRNASer was delivering the amino acid, and (3) there is no special pattern underlying the suppressed codons, as might be expected if slippage were occurring.",

This approach gives us some idea about the tolerance of the E. coli translational apparatus to variation in the tRNAs for suppression of four-base codons (presumably combined with tRNA maturation and aminoacylation differences, which are probably minimal here). Figure 3\nshows the consensus sequences for tRNAs able to suppress AGGA at various levels of ampicillin compared with the known E. coli tRNAs. The best suppressors of this codon maintain the universal U33 and highly favored A37 seen in E. coli tRNAs. At the 300 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ampicillin level, U33 or C33 and A37 are favored, but G is present in some clones at both sites. When much weaker suppressors were selected (20 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ampicillin), no base is conserved at position 33 and, though A37 is favored, G37 and U37 are seen. This calls into question the necessity of the U33 to make the sharp turn seen in the X-ray crystal structure of tRNAPhe\nHolbrook et al 1978, Sussman and Kim 1976. Even the 33.5 position corresponding to AGGA is not entirely conserved in these weak suppressors, though U33.5 is still strongly favored. Some 5 % of the clones selected at 300 \u03bcg ml\u22121 and 19 % at 20 \u03bcg ml\u22121 have the possibility of an A:U or U:A pair at the 32:38 site, which would formally extend the anticodon stem by one pair and leave a 6 nt loop. Other work has suggested that it is unlikely that a 6 nt loop can present a four-base anticodon (Atkins et al., 1991), and five of the seven clones of this type retain complementary UCCU anticodons, perhaps suggesting why only the weaker A:U pair is seen at this site and not the C:G pair. Nevertheless, the possibility of 6 nt anticodon loop tRNAs decoding four-base codons cannot be ruled out.",

At 300 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ampicillin, U38 is favored, while either pyrimidine is favored at 20 \u03bcg ml\u22121. This differs both from the E. coli preference for A38 and lack of preference in 8 nt tRNAs. U33 is strongly preferred at both ampicillin concentrations, much more so than in the 8 nt anticodon loops. Also, while there is degeneracy at the 32 position, the stronger suppressors do not have A32, possibly to avoid 32:38 pairing with the favored U38. At 300 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ampicillin, three of the nine clones have the possibility of a weak G32:U38 wobble pair (resulting in a 7 nt anticodon loop and extended anticodon stem), but none can canonically pair. However, among the weaker suppressors, two of 37 clones can have a U:A or A:U pair and five can have a G:C pair.

It is helpful in this regard that all of the useful four-base codons are based on rare natural codons. This greatly reduces the potential need to silently mutate related codons in the gene of interest (i.e. if one employed AGGA suppression in a gene containing AGG codons) to avoid missense or frameshift suppression at other sites. Moreover, that these codons are extremely rare and that the suppressors are not toxic to E. coli suggests that there is not a notable problem with suppression of three or four-base codons by these tRNAs genome-wide. Equally important is the fact that the suppressor tRNAs do not interact with other codons. Selection with the best suppressor tRNAs from the library of all four-base codons resulted in, at worst, limited sets of highly related codons. For example, no other codon was selected even at very low ampicillin concentration with the tRNA that suppressed CUAG (Table 7). In the cases of UAGA and AGGA, suppression of other UAGN or AGGN codons at more moderate levels of ampicillin (though still at least fivefold lower than in the canonical case) probably places a practical limit on the use of similar four-base codons in a single transcript. For example, AGGA and AGGU are probably sufficiently cross-reactive that they should be avoided in a single transcript, whereas AGGA, CUAG and UAGA and CCCU are likely to be simultaneously useful.",

However, the actual amount of tolerance for errors is difficult to appreciate. It is estimated that DNA replication fidelity is between 10\u22128 and 10\u221211 per base in vivo, but transcriptional and translational fidelity is closer to 10\u22124 per codon (Parker, 1989). Manley (1978) demonstrated that a measured 5\u00d710\u22124 frameshift error rate corresponds to approximately 30 % of incipient translations of a given protein resulting in some sort of abortive synthesis, due in large part to the relative prevalence of stop codons in the non-coding frames. Especially for genes that are transcribed at very low levels, this appears to be a significant energetic waste that is tolerated by the cell, and one must wonder if it is not being exploited as a subtle, stochastic mechanism of regulation or is an evolutionary artifact.",

For example, we found efficient missense suppressors of a variety of codons corresponding to a wide variety of amino acids. While it is true that these tended to correspond to underrepresented codons (Table 9), even the least used codon must appear in the largely transcribed E. coli genome hundreds to thousands of times. Hong et al. (1998) found that a glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase mutant that inserted glutamic acid for glutamine less than 5 % of the time resulted in a 40 % increase in doubling time of the bacteria. However, none of the missense suppressors found here had demonstrably toxic effects, and were selected at levels comparable to about 15 % suppression efficiency as measured with the nitrocefin assay for our four-base suppressors. Moreover, at many of these same rare codons, very efficient suppressors of four-base codons could be maintained without deleterious effects on cell growth, and in at least one case (UUCU) a moderately efficient suppressor was found for an overrepresented codon. It is conceivable that this is an evolutionary requirement, wherein only those organisms that could tolerate a reasonable level of translational errata were sufficiently free to adapt to environmental stresses.",

These tend to be highly repetitive sequences; specifically, sequences with tandem repeats in the second and third position of the codon. Some of these correspond to codons used widely throughout the genome (AAA accounts for 3.84 % of codons in E. coli). A number of these sequences have been exploited by nature at programmed frameshift sites. For example, E. coli RF2 is produced when a UGA stop codon is averted by slippage on a CUUU site, which was seen here. In the yeast Ty1 element, slippage occurs on CUUA to generate the TYB protein, a pol analog (Farabaugh, 1996). In the case of the RF2 site, engineered alteration of the CUU to UUA, CUA, GUA, GUG or AUA caused drastic decreases in shifting, but alteration to GUU, UUU, CCC or CCU retained higher levels. While only UUUU was found in our selection, the other sites except for CCUU clearly retain the internal tandem-repeat motif Curran 1993, Weiss et al 1987.",

The selected codons differ from this list in three ways: (i) the identities of N are anomalous; (ii) AAGN, CCCN and CCUN were not found; and (iii) CGGN and CGAU were found. The potential advantage of additionally re-pairing the third base would explain AAAA, UUUU and CUUU but not AGGC, GGGA, UUUC or the other CUUN, which largely do not even follow wobble rules. It is unlikely that AAGN, CCUN and CCCN were simply not in the library, since the sequence space is small (256) and more than 70 clones were sequenced including duplicates of most sequences. Probably, CCUN and CCCN did not appear due to lack of tolerance for Pro at S124, as CCN codes for Pro, and perhaps the central wobble re-pair in AAGN is especially unfavorable. Shiftiness at CGGN and CGAU is not explained by this hypothesis, especially since no re-pairing is possible with CGAU, but it is of note that both of these codons are highly underrepresented in E. coli. It seems likely that the full explanation of inherent shiftiness at a given codon is a combination of the ability of the tRNA to re-pair in the new frame, the abundance of the tRNA and the context of the codon generally.",

Preliminary experiments suggest that efficient suppression of even more extended codons (five-base and perhaps six-base) is possible with tRNAs with even more extended anticodon loops, and we are currently examining this in depth (J.C.A. and P.G.S., unpublished results). This approach is complementary to our approach in collaboration with Romesberg et al., of generating additional codons by designing novel base-pairs (Ogawa et al., 2000), and has the present advantage of being immediately useful in vitro for a wide range of experiments to probe the limits of biosynthesis of unnatural polypeptides.",
