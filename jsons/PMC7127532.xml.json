Cases of MERS-CoV infection are associated with a high case fatality rate since there is no available treatment. There is a scarcity of data on specific therapeutic interventions for the disease. Published reports propose the use of known antivirals based on extrapolation of data from: (i) the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that was also associated with the circulation of a novel coronavirus; (ii) in vitro data; (iii) animal experimental infections and therapy data; and (iv) limited clinical data for actual MERS-CoV infections [2], [3], [4]. However, no clear-cut recommended therapeutic regimen exists and the evidence for grading such interventions is generally low, with the exception of the use of convalescent serum that based on biological effects is given the highest grade [5]. Moreover, little is known about the viral kinetics of MERS-CoV-associated infection, especially when a specific antiviral or other therapeutic intervention is attempted.",

            "text": "Prolonged shedding of the virus was noted from the respiratory tract of the patient. This finding is consistent with data regarding the SARS coronavirus. In a report dealing with patients affected by SARS, prolonged shedding of the virus was noted in stool (up to 126 days) and respiratory specimens (up to 52 days) [16]. Data regarding the length of MERS-CoV excretion from different body sites are scarce [17]. Excretion of the virus probably depends on the amplitude of replication in different body sites, the underlying immune status and co-morbidities, and appropriate antiviral therapy. The non-detectable viral RNA in serum by Day 3 after initiation of the antiviral treatment could be explained either by viral clearance in an otherwise immunocompetent person or by effectiveness of the instituted antiviral regimen. Literature on appropriate antiviral intervention for MERS-CoV is very limited and currently no evidence-based therapy exists. The regimen chosen was based on the best available literature as well as evidence from animal and patient data that have been described elsewhere [2], [3], [4]. The role of interferon therapy for MERS-CoV infection needs to be further elucidated. An attenuated interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) response has been described as a result of MERS-CoV infection [18] and extensive use of interferon-based regimens alone or in combination with ribavirin has been described for SARS [4]. However, interferons appear to have a better antiviral effect on MERS-CoV compared with SARS-CoV in in vitro experiments [19]. In vitro, IFN-\u03b2 appears to exhibit the best anti-MERS-CoV effect [20]. Interferon activity has been enhanced by the addition of ribavirin in in vitro experiments [21]. Furthermore, this combination has shown promising clinical and radiological effects in Rhesus macaques experimentally infected with MERS-CoV [12]. Thus, the clinical team elected to use this combination despite the fact that a prestigious public health agency ranks ribavirin use as not supported by high-quality evidence [5]. In a more recent update published by the same public health agency, the use of interferons and lopinavir is ranked under the recommendation of benefit is likely to exceed risk, whereas the combination of interferon and ribavirin is ranked as data are inadequate for assessment [22]. The frequent side effects of ribavirin limit its use in combination regimens for actual MERS-CoV-infected patients, as was the experience with the current patient where liver toxicity, although not definitively associated, was mainly attributed to this medication. The renal function deterioration of the patient described here was considered multifactorial and probably also a complication of the virus infection [23]. The possibility that drug toxicity might have contributed in the renal dysfunction could not be excluded, however. No drug levels were measured since the patient was under continuous renal replacement therapy at that time and drug levels would be unreliable. In the actual clinical human setting, the combination of ribavirin and interferon has been tried, with no successful outcome reported among any of the MERS-CoV-infected recipients [3]. Nevertheless, the group studied consisted of severely ill patients who received this combination quite late in the course of their disease [3]. Lastly, we added the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir based on experience accumulated from the SARS epidemic where the addition of this agent to ribavirin improved the outcome of infection [24].",

Also, the presence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in camels across a wide geographic area in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula signifies the possibility for zoonotic transmission between camels and humans [27], [28], [29]. The potential for transmission across different individual strains should be further explored. In this patient, the most likely source of exposure was the hospital environment in an endemic area, as his wife was hospitalised in a local hospital in Jeddah [6].
