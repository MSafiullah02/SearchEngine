            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Using multiplex PCR/RT-PCR methods for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses, the circulation of those viruses during 3 consecutive dry seasons in Cambodia was described. Among 234 patients who presented with influenza-like illness, 35.5% were positive for at least one virus. Rhinoviruses (43.4%), parainfluenza (31.3%) viruses and coronaviruses (21.7%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus 4 and SARS-coronavirus were not detected during the study period. Ninety apparently healthy individuals were included as controls and 10% of these samples tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. No significant differences were observed in frequency and in virus copy numbers for rhinovirus detection between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. This study raises questions about the significance of the detection of some respiratory viruses, especially using highly sensitive methods, given their presence in apparently healthy individuals. The link between the presence of the virus and the origin of the illness is therefore unclear.",

Acute respiratory infections are also associated with high mortality in the elderly and individuals with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems. Clinical manifestations in respiratory infections range from self-limited upper respiratory tract infections to more serious lower respiratory tract infections. Determining etiological diagnoses for patients with respiratory symptoms remains a clinical and laboratory challenge. Most laboratory-confirmed viral infections are attributed to respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), influenza viruses A and B (IAV, IBV), human rhinoviruses (HRhV), and adenoviruses (AdV). Clinical virology laboratories have used historically traditional methods such as direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) for the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections, however, these methods fail to detect a large proportion of infections.",

In our study, the multiplex approach, by comparison with a ''monoplex'' PCR or RT-PCR, was sometimes associated with a decrease in sensitivity. Nevertheless, sensitivity was improved after optimization of the Freymuth's protocols, who demonstrated previously that the multiplex RT-PCR represented a significant improvement over conventional methods [Freymuth et al., 2006] . The multiplex 4 and 5 developed for this study also allowed the detection of very low nucleic acid copy numbers, and therefore it was considered that these two methods are reasonably sensitive and specific for the detection of respiratory viruses.",

Three single infections and three co-infections were observed. RSV is usually the most important viral cause of lower respiratory tract infections among infants and young children in both developing and developed countries [Selwyn, 1990] ; and also infects the elderly [Falsey et al., 2005] . RSV has a worldwide distribution, with outbreaks occurring yearly with an unusually predictable and regular pattern. In temperate climates, RSV causes annual epidemics during the winter months [Collins et al., 1996] [Weber et al., 1998; Loscertales et al., 2002] . As is the case for HMPV, the low prevalence of respiratory infections caused by RSV in this study might be explained by the fact that the study was conducted during the dry season, or that the influenzalike illness definition does not fit well with symptoms observed during RSV infections. According to the literature, HMPV is identified in 3% to nearly 20% of patients who suffer from acute respiratory infections, especially in children (Brazil: 17.8%; Germany: 18%; Hong Kong: 5.5%; Italy: 3,8%; Korea: 4.7%; Singapore: 5.3%) [Peiris et al., 2003; K\u00f6nig et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2006; Loo et al., 2007; Thomazelli et al., 2007; Fabbiani et al., 2009] . The seasonal patterns of HMPV infections in tropical countries are not known. This study was conducted during the dry season only, which could explain why only two HMPV infections were detected. Indeed, recent data from a larger study confirmed that HMPV was responsible for infections in Cambodian patients but with a peak of transmission during the rainy season [Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, unpublished work]. In addition, the influenza-like illness case definition is not well adapted for HMPV infections which are usually associated with low or no fever, rhino-pharyngitis, and rarely cough.",

In Thailand, one of Cambodia's neighboring countries, a study recruiting patients from all ages showed that 3.9% of samples were positive for HBoV, and more commonly in children <4 years old [Fry et al., 2007] . In Cambodia, only one case was reported. The virus was detected in a 13-year-old adolescent. Additional studies are necessary to document the importance of HBoV as a viral agent responsible for respiratory infections.",

HRhV appears to be as frequent in the control group as in the patient group, suggesting that these viruses can be detected in the respiratory tract without causing any symptoms and that the detection of these viruses is not necessarily associated with a disease. These results are consistent with other data demonstrating detection of HRhV and HBoV by RT-PCR in 15-30% and 5% of asymptomatic individuals, respectively [van Benten et al., 2003; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2008; Jartti et al., 2008; Peltola et al., 2008] . Semi-quantitation revealed that the quantity of rhinovirus nucleic acid copies detected in the clinical specimens is similar in both groups and thus can not explain by itself the absence of symptoms in the control group. The number of cases in the present study is limited and the data should therefore be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, similar findings showing comparable nucleic acid copy numbers in symptomatic and in asymptomatic individuals were obtained previously in Finland using quantitative RT-PCR .",

The use of sensitive PCR techniques has obviously increased virus detection rates and not only in symptomatic but also in asymptomatic subjects, and has made the interpretation of positive test results somehow more complicated. The link of causality between virus identification and symptoms remains uncertain, especially when low copy numbers and multiple viruses are detected. Furthermore, at the time of specimen collection, the patient could be in an incubation period and not experiencing any symptoms. In addition, a subject could be asymptomatic whereas the PCR detects remnants of distant infection. For instance, HBoV and HRhV may persist several weeks in nasopharyngeal cavities in convalescent patients [Jartti et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2010] . Nevertheless, some limitations have to be taken into account for this study since the number of enrolled individuals is limited, especially in the asymptomatic group.",

The objective of the project was to describe the pattern of respiratory virus circulation during the dry season when such viruses are expected to circulate at low levels.

Several studies have been conducted previously to evaluate the viral etiologies of acute respiratory infections, but unfortunately few have compared results from symptomatic patients with those from asymptomatic individuals. This study raises the question of the significance of the detection of some respiratory viruses, especially when using highly sensitive detection methods, and of the link between the virus presence and the origin of the illness.",
