The outbreak began in the east of France during the first days of March after a religious meeting gathering about 2000 people, which took place in Mulhouse from 17th to 24th February 2020.",

In the beginning of the second week, all medical ICU beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. The cardiac surgery ICU (4 beds) was transformed to a COVID-19 ICU, as scheduled surgical and medical activity was stopped. Sixteen additional beds were added in five operative and post-operative rooms. Eight beds \u201cnon-COVID-19\u201d ICU was created in another post-operative room.
