Medical gloves are made of different polymers, including latex, nitrile rubber, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, and neoprene. Nitrile and latex gloves are preferred during the COVID-19 pandemic due to better durability.1 Latex gloves are flexible, fit well, are sensitive to touch, and provide moderate protection.2 Vinyl gloves provide moderate protection, are sensitive to touch, but are not as durable.2 However, nitrile gloves are chemical- and puncture-resistant and provide the highest level of protection and durability.2 Many adverse skin reactions, including irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and contact urticaria have been reported with the use of all types of gloves.3\n",

Hypersensitivity to natural rubber latex (NRL) has been increasingly reported, with an incidence of 2.8% to 17% among HCWs.3 HCWs are highly at risk of developing allergic reactions to NRL, especially operating room personnel, dental assistants, laboratory personnel, hospital housekeeping personnel, and ambulance attendants.4 Atopic background, history of hand dermatitis, allergy to certain foods, female gender, and multiple exposures are among the risk factors for developing hypersensitivity to NRL.3 Hypersensitivity reaction to bananas, avocados, chestnuts, kiwis, and other fruits have been reported among these patients.5 Skin reactions include localized pruritus, burning, stinging, contact and generalized urticaria. The most frequently observed reaction is irritant contact dermatitis presenting as dry, crusted, fissuring patches.4 In suspected patients, a thorough history of allergic reactions to balloons, gloves, barium enema, and other latex devices should be taken. The gold standard in the diagnosis is skin-prick testing in patients with localized symptoms and latex-specific IgE antibody assessment in cases of systemic symptoms.5 However, the wear and/or use test and the patch test are the alternative diagnostic tests.4 The most effective approach for the management of latex allergy is personal and environmental avoidance by considering hypoallergic gloves.4\n",
