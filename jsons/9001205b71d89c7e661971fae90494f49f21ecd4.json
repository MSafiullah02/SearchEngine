Within CRP(+)/SAA(+) group, mean viral load/mL (log10) tended to increase 153 along with the worsening of severity (mean, 4.80, 5.05 and 5.50 respectively; 4.80 vs 154 5.50, P<0.05). No statistical differences were found between CRP(+)/SAA(+) group 155 and CRP(-)/SAA(+) group of severe pneumonia patients (5.50 vs 5.55, P>0.05). The 156 value in pneumonia patients did not change much among the groups. Interestingly, 157 no severe pneumonia case showed CRP(-)/SAA(-). 158 Association of CRP/SAA with SARS-Cov-2 Viral loads.

The trend of viral load in the CRP(-)/SAA(+) group was 168 different from others. The value in CRP(-)/SAA(+) group of day 0-1 was 5.05, and 169",

Although statistical significances were 184 only found in CRP, our results suggest both CRP and SAA have some indication of 185 the severity of the disease. 186 Previous studies have shown that these indicators have directive effects on the 187 infection and condition judgment of other viral diseases 20-23 . This study also reveals 188 the relationship between these indicators and viral load among COVID-19 patients 189 and provides clues for the prevention and control of the disease. 190 A higher viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory epithelial cells indicates a 191 higher risk to transmit this virus. In this study, we found the natural fluctuation of 192 SARS-CoV-2 viral load had different trends among COVID-19 patients before 193 antiviral treatments in the early stage of illness. Pneumonia cases maintained high 194 viral loads on days 0-5 after onset. However, IgM(+) non-pneumonia patients had 195 higher viral loads within 0-3 days after onset. More attention showed be payed to 196 such patients because their symptoms are not obvious. Patients with CRP(+)/SAA(+) 197 and CRP(-)/SAA(-) also presented higher viral load within 0-1 days after onset. It is suggested that using these indicators may help us to predict the transmitting risk of 199 the patients. 200 The viral load of IgM(-) patients did not decrease with the increase of onset time, 201 instead, it showed an upward trend. This may reflect the antiviral effect of the IgM 202 antibodies. However, the viral load of IgM(+) patients in severe cases remained high 203 12 days after onset, which might indicate that the antiviral effect of IgM antibodies is 204 weak, or there are other factors involved in the early resistance to the virus. A high 205 viral load at this time also indicated the patient's condition might be not in a good 206 direction, and an effective antiviral therapy was needed. 207 CRP(+) might have different suggestive effects on the condition of different types 208 of patients. The viral load of CRP(+)/SAA(+) non-pneumonia patients was 209 significantly lower than that of CRP(+)/SAA(+) severe pneumonia patients, and it was 210 also lower than that of other types of non-pneumonia patients. For severe pneumonia 211 patients, the viral load of CRP(+)/SAA(+) cases was about the same as that of CRP(-212 )/SAA(+) patients. The relationship should be studied in patients after admission, 213 which gave clues that the elevation of CRP in severe pneumonia patient might 214",
