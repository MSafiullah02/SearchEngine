Health authorities placed 8000 people in quarantine early in the epidemic.

One potential explanation may be earlier and higher accumulation of viral load in the upper respiratory tract of infected individuals.19 The viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were higher in a small case series of 18 patients20 than for patients with SARS-CoV.21 In the same study, the viral load in a single asymptomatic patient (tested because of close contact with known cases) was similar to that in symptomatic patients, which may support reports of transmission earlier in the course of infection.22 These patterns appear similar to patients with influenza23 and imply value in early case detection to prevent the transmission of infections. Despite these findings, it is important to appreciate that, based upon generalised principles of viral transmission, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers are likely to disperse less viral load and ultimately be less contagious than symptomatic individuals, but at present we are unable to quantify by how much.",

Although surface sampling from the rooms of patients with COVID-19 showed extensive environmental contamination, post-cleaning samples were negative, suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient. Air sampling of patient rooms was also negative, although patients in the study had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms only and did not undergo any aerosol generating procedures.26\n",

During this time the WHO,27 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),28 and Public Health England (PHE)29 all moved from a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 strategy, to one in which PPE use is risk stratified and the appropriate PPE is selected for the task required. Thus incremental contact, droplet and airborne precautions against COVID-19 have been established in the UK,29\n,\n30 meaning that all clinical areas considered to have frequent aerosol generating procedures, including ICU and operating theatres have similar PPE precautions. An exception to this standard is during neuraxial anaesthesia for elective Caesarean delivery, during which the risk of conversion to an aerosolising general anaesthetic is considered low and predictable in advance, hence droplet precautions are adequate for anaesthetists.31 A risk adaptive approach is recommended for other environments, where precautions should follow the risk of transmission during different clinical interactions. A common feature of all recommendations is that, irrespective of PPE required for each task, the equipment is used carefully and correctly, focusing particularly on safe removal.",

Measured air dispersion with a full-facemask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system has been subsequently compared to CPAP with nasal pillows.59 Air dispersion with full-facemask CPAP was negligible at both low (5 cm H2O) and high (20 cm H2O) pressure ventilation.

Therefore patients on CPAP should ideally be cared for in negative-pressure facilities with staff wearing PPE appropriate for airborne contamination.62 The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) recommends that where necessary, patients using NIV should be isolated in side rooms with doors closed.62 If necessary, several patients, all of whom should have confirmed COVID-19, can be cared for in a \u2018cohort bay\u2019.
