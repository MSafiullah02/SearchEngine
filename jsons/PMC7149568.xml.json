Values for the first three variables are often described in electronic textual patient records. Figure 17.1\nshows excerpts from a patient's medical record generated during an ED visit, including the triage chief complaint, history and physical exam, and chest radiograph report. A human physician reading these textual records could easily determine the correct values for the first three variables. Information from the fourth variable (Travel) may not be accessible anywhere in the patient's medical record unless the dictating physician had been concerned about SARS and had dictated the travel history.

It is not possible to extract diagnoses from chief complaints, because information in a chief complaint is recorded before the patient even sees a physician. Once a patient is examined by a physician, the patient's diagnosis may be recorded in a dictated report. Extracting information from dictated reports is much more difficult, because a report tells a complex story about the patient involving references to time and negation of symptoms that are not present in chief complaints.",

The number of unique acronyms in MEDLINE is increasing at the rate of 11,000 per year, and the number of definitions associated with unique acronyms is increasing at 44,000 per year. In the sublanguage of patient reports, the type of report is helpful in disambiguating the correct meaning of an acronym or abbreviation, because the report type indicates the type of medical specialty.

For example, a text classification application may classify MEDLINE abstracts into one of many possible MeSH categories or may classify websites by topic. Various statistical models have been applied to the problem of text classification, including regression models, Bayesian belief networks, nearest neighbor algorithms, neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. The basic element in all text classification algorithms is the frequency distribution of the words in the text. Applications of text classification of free-text patient medical records include retrieving records of interest to a specific research query (Aronis et al., 1999, Cooper et al., 1998), assigning ICD-9 admission diagnoses to chief complaints (Gundersen et al., 1996), and retrieving medical images with specific abnormalities (Hersh et al., 2001). In the domain of biosurveillance, text classification techniques have been applied to triage chief complaints and chest radiograph reports. CoCo (Olszewski, 2003) is a naive Bayesian text classification application that classifies free-text triage chief complaints into syndromic categories, such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurological, based on the frequency distribution of the words in the chief complaints. For example, the chief complaint \u201ccough\u201d would be assigned a higher probability of being respiratory than of being gastrointestinal or neurological, because chief complaints in the training corpus that contained the word \u201ccough\u201d were classified most frequently as respiratory. The IPS system (Aronis et al., 1999, Cooper et al., 1998) was used to create a query for retrieving chest radiograph reports describing mediastinal findings consistent with inhalational anthrax (Chapman et al., 2003). The IPS system uses likelihood ratios to identify words that discriminate between relevant and not relevant documents.",

Automated part-of-speech taggers use either rules or probability distributions learned from hand-tagged training sets to assign parts of speech and perform with an accuracy of 96-97% on general English texts, such as newspaper articles, scientific journals, and books. Part-of-speech distribution in patient reports is different than that of nonclinical texts. For example, discharge summaries contain more nouns and past tense verbs and fewer proper nouns (e.g., people and company names) and present tense verbs (Campbell and Johnson, 2001). Not surprisingly, training a part-of-speech tagger on medical texts improves its accuracy when assigning parts of speech to patient reports (Campbell and Johnson, 2001, Coden et al., 2005).

The NLP application for identifying fever in chief complaints performed with perfect sensitivity and specificity in the feature detection evaluation. However, when quantifying how well the automatically extracted variable of fever from chief complaints identified patients who had a true fever based on reference standard judgment from the ED report, the chief complaint fever detector only performed with a sensitivity of 61%. The specificity remained at 100%. On the one hand, whenever a chief complaint mentioned fever, the patient actually had a fever, so there were no false-positive diagnoses from chief complaints. On the other hand, despite the fact that the NLP technology did not make any mistakes in determining if fever was described in a chief complaint, the chief complaints themselves did not always mention fever when the patient was febrile in the ED. As demonstrated by this study, coupling evaluations on feature detection with evaluations on case detection can inform us about the source of diagnostic errors, which could be the NLP technology, the input data itself, or a combination of the two.",

Outbreaks of other infectious or otherwise concerning diseases, such as anthrax, West Nile virus, hemor-rhagic fever, or SARS, rarely occur in the United States.

Outcome measures were reported for correlation between chief complaint classifications and ICD-9 classifications and for timeliness of detection. Figure 17.7\nfrom the Ivanov publication shows the time series plot of respiratory illness admissions (reference standard) and chief complaints. It is evident from the plot that chief complaints generated the same type of signal that the reference standard generated.

            "text": "This chapter has focused on applying NLP techniques to variable extraction from patient medical records, but other types of free-text documents contain information that may be useful for biosurveillance, including web queries, transcripts from call centers, and autopsy reports. Regardless of the type of free-text data, we suggest three questions to consider when deciding whether application of NLP techniques to textual data is feasible for disease and outbreak detection: (1) How complex is the text? The simple phrases in chief complaints are much easier to understand than complex discourses contained in ED reports. Textual data that require coreference resolution, domain modeling for inference, and other more difficult techniques required to identify values for the variables of interest will be more challenging to process and will be more prone to error. (2) What is the goal of the NLP technique? If the goal is to understand all temporal, anatomic, and diagnostic relations described in the text as well as a physician could, you may be in for a lifetime of hard but interesting work. Extraction of a single variable, such as fever, or encoding temporal, anatomic, and diagnostic relations for a finite set of findings, such as all respiratory findings, is more feasible. (3) Can the detection algorithms that will use the variables extracted with NLP handle noise? Detecting small outbreaks requires more accuracy in the input variables. As an extreme example, some diseases such as inhalational anthrax require only a single case to be considered a threatening outbreak. If the NLP-based expert system did not correctly detect that case, then the detection system would have failed. However, in detecting an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness, for example, if the NLP-based expert system only detected two-thirds of the true cases, there may still be enough positive patients to detect a moderate to large-sized outbreak. In addition, the consistent stream of false positive cases identified by the NLP-based expert system would comprise a noisy baseline that may not prevent the algorithm from detecting a significant increase in gastrointestinal cases but would require a larger increase to detect the outbreak. Consideration of these three questions can help determine the feasibility of using NLP for outbreak and disease surveillance.",

Characteristics such as linguistic variation, polysemy, negation, contextual information, finding validation, implication, and coreference must be accounted for to understand the information within patient medical reports as well as a physician does. However, because many of the variables helpful in biosurveillance do not require complete understanding of the text, NLP techniques may successfully extract variables useful for outbreak detection. In fact, evaluations of feature detection, case detection, and epidemic detection of NLP techniques have begun to demonstrate the utility of NLP techniques in this new field. More research in NLP techniques and more evaluation studies of the effectiveness of NLP will not only increase our understanding of how to extract information from text but will also help us continue to learn what types of data provide the most timely and accurate information for detecting outbreaks.",
