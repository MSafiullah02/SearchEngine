She was treated for in\u00a3uenza, which was isolated repeatedly from oropharynx and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) \u00a3uids, and later empirically for lupus pneumonitis, but died 6 months after transplant. Autopsy \u00a2ndings failed to show in\u00a3uenza in the lungs or lupus pneumonitis. A novel generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay using degenerate primers identi\u00a2ed human coronavirus (CoV) HKU1 RNA in BAL \u00a3uid at autopsy. CoV was con\u00a2rmed by virus-speci\u00a2c PCRs of lung tissue at autopsy. Electron microscopy showed viral particles consistent with CoV HKU1 in lung tissue both at autopsy and from a previous biopsy. Although human CoV HKU1 infection is not usually severe, in highly immunocompromised patients, it can be associated with fatal pneumonia.",

CoV HKU1 usually causes relatively mild community-acquired infections in children, characterized by rhinorrhea, cough, and fever (12^18); infection can result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia; occasionally, hypoxia and abnormal chest x-rays are described (12, 14) . CoV HKU1 has also been related to a high incidence of febrile seizures (15) . Another study implies that CoV HKU1 could be associated with enteric symptoms (5) . Pneumonia related to CoV HKU1 infection occurs mostly in older people with underlying diseases, in particular severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and in transplant recipients, although the virus was not identi\u00a2ed in lung tissue in these prior studies (16) . Two fatal cases of CoV HKU1-associated community-acquired pneumonia were reported, in which virus was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by RT-PCR (16) . Both patients had lymphopenia and were su\u00a1ering from diabetes mellitus; 1 patient was 66 years old and had gastric lymphoma, while the other was 72 years old and had prostate carcinoma. Our patient received a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen for autologous HSCT, which results in prolonged T and B cell lymphopenia, and she was severely immunocompromised from both her HSCT and from the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat possible lupus pneumonitis. Although in\u00a3uenza was suspected as a cause of the patient's pneumonitis and was repeatedly isolated from nasopharyngeal washes and BAL \u00a3uids, immunohistochemistry of lung tissue obtained at biopsy and at autopsy failed to show in\u00a3uenza virus. While inhaled zanamivir may have reduced the sensitivity of culture, immunohistochemistry would be expected to show evidence of in\u00a3uenza infection if the virus were a signi\u00a2cant cause of disease in this patient (19) Although in\u00a3uenza virus infection may have been a contributor to the patient's symptoms early after HSCT, the continued progression of bronchopneumonia while on antivirals for in\u00a3uenza, along with failure to identify in\u00a3uenza in the lower respiratory tract in any clinical sample after the initial positive BALs at weeks 14 and 17 after transplantation, or at autopsy, strongly suggested that in\u00a3uenza was not the cause of her fatal illness. Highly immunocompromised patients are known to shed in\u00a3uenza in the upper respiratory tract for months (20) and the in\u00a3uenza virus in the BAL \u00a3uids may have been due to shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Another possible diagnosis in our patient was idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), which presents as di\u00a1use lung injury without evidence of infection. Our patient was in the intermediate period after transplant (days 30^100), which is the median time for onset of IPS (between 21 and 87 days post transplant) (21) . IPS is typically described after allogeneic HSCT in which the level of immunosuppression is usually more profound than after standard autologous HSCT. The reported frequency of IPS ranges between 2% and 17%, averaging about 10% (21) . CoV and other respiratory viruses may be responsible for some cases of IPS, if reliable means of detection are not employed. An increasing arsenal of diagnostic tools for detection of respiratory viruses is developing, including rapid antigen detection, The DOP-PCR protocol, used to identify CoV HKU1 in this case, has several signi\u00a2cant advantages over other methods. This universal virus detection tool can provide sequence information of the pathogen present in a given sample without any prior information about the genome. DOP-PCR is unbiased and has a detection limit that is close to that of nucleic acid testing techniques that use virus-speci\u00a2c primers (1) . Subtractive techniques that might be used in order to identify a pathogen require an uninfected but otherwise genetically identical control, which may be di\u2044cult to obtain for clinical samples. We previously showed that the detection limit of the DOP-PCR is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than that of other generic detection techniques (1) . Isolation of nucleic acids from puri\u00a2ed nucleocapsids in the DOP-PCR protocol is more likely to detect intact infectious particles than PCR of the whole sample, which has large amounts of contaminating cellular nucleic acids. DOP-PCR, in which viral nucleic acid sequences are highly enriched before PCR is performed, may be especially useful for \u00a2nding pathogens that cannot be readily identi\u00a2ed by standard methods. Nonetheless, results from non-speci\u00a2c screening techniques like the DOP-PCR must be independently veri-\u00a2ed, as exempli\u00a2ed by the detection by DOP-PCR of non-viral sequences in the autopsy specimen.",

Although there may have been other co-factors, CoV HKU1 infection likely contributed to this patient's fatal outcome. The patient shed in\u00a3uenza virus from the respiratory tract for several months, and this virus was thought to be a cause of pneumonia during much of her hospital course after transplantation. When in\u00a3uenza infection was considered less likely, and lupus pneumonitis was considered a possibility, she received immunosuppressive therapy that may have exacerbated her CoV HKU1 infection. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the transient improvements observed after increases in immunosuppressive therapy were due to reduction in the in\u00a3ammatory response to CoV HKU1 infection, this case illustrates the importance of obtaining appropriate specimens from patients with unexplained pneumonitis and the value of unbiased approaches such as the universal virus detection assay employed here to identify other causes of pulmonary in\u00a2ltrates and hypoxemia.
