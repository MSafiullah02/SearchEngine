            "text": "The announcement that a Chinese team had gene-edited embryos, resulting in a live twin birth and another ongoing pregnancy, met with global condemnation (Caplan 2018; Cheung 2018). Many questions surrounded the research, not least because it was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. Chief among these questions was the issue of why HIV was chosen for this first CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) embryo implantation rather than a serious heritable genetic disease. The fact that the trial was conducted in secrecy in China led to a degree of speculation about what participants were told about the study, particularly given that the researcher seemed unclear on the normal ethical requirements for clinical trials and felt the need to consult experts in the United States (He 2018). Helpfully, an English translation of several documents relating to the trial was made available online by the researchers, and it provides a certain degree of clarity; ethically, things are even worse than they initially appeared.",

You may withdraw from this study at any time without any pre-requisite prior to completing the COH\u201d (Appendix 1, 6). It is not true that withdrawal has no negative impact on future health care as IVF will cease. The rest of this article is not unreasonable, until it is made clear that couples effectively cannot withdraw once the embryo is implanted unless they wait until the baby is one month old\u2014they would have to repay all costs and also risk a substantial fine. \u201cAfter the embryo implantation in the first cycle of IVF until 28 days post-birth of the baby, if you decide to leave the study due to other reasons than the ones listed in Items 3 and 4 above, you will need to pay back all the costs that the project team has paid for you. If the payment is not received within 10 calendar days from the issuance of the notification of violation by the project team, another 100,000 RMB [over \u00a311,000] of fine will be charged\u201d (Appendix 1, 7). This means that participants who withdraw during this period could owe over \u00a340,000; article 7 makes it clear that the study team will pay for the costs of IVF and transport to a maximum of 280,000 RMB (\u00a332,000) per couple, which would have to be repaid along with the fine. This is a great deal of money and calls into question the voluntariness of participation.

It is also not stated that following one live birth no more embryos will be implanted\u2014this means that any parent without an implanted embryo will have to wait for potentially eighteen years, if that is when it is deemed to be safe to do so. This means that many participants who were promised a baby, and hopefully an HIV-immune baby, have been lied to.

The only good things that can be said about this trial are that the publication of the consent materials is transparent and that transparency sheds a bright light on all of the ethical failings of the study\u2014a light made all the more intense by the fact that the study clearly contradicts the PI\u2019s own ethical principles for ethical gene editing. Quite apart from the concerns about premature risk of germ-line CRISPR modification, the participants in this study were clearly misinformed about the study\u2019s purpose, as well as being subjected to considerable pressure (via free IVF) to take part. Germ-line editing of human embryos intended for implantation is already ethically fraught (Heidari et al. 2017) without introducing further ethical issues in the consent materials. Ethical gene editing requires ethical consent and information materials, and ethical principles require at least a degree of ethical content.",
