Although it is well tolerated by most patients, it is not a benign procedure with potential complications including hypoxaemia, bleeding and pneumothorax.3 Knowing which patient's bronchoscopy is most likely to benefit is of key importance to clinicians. While imaging can give some clues to the potential diagnostic yield of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL),4 non\u2010invasive laboratory testing is tremendously valuable. In many patients, bronchoscopy is only entertained after non\u2010invasive testing, such as nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory viral panel (RVP), has been performed.",

They were able to identify 89 patients who met these criteria over a 5\u2010year period at a single university medical centre. This institution employed the FilmArray (Biofire Diagnostic Inc, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) multiplex PCR, an assay which detects adenovirus, coronavirus (four strains), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis. The patients had a median time duration between NP and BAL testing of 2 days, and 31 of 89 patients had viruses identified on testing.",

Additionally, if there is a low pretest probability for respiratory infection, these tests may reduce the need for invasive testing. Obtaining a positive NP finding may expedite treatment for respiratory viral infections such RSV or influenza, which have significant risk for morbidity in this patient population and effective treatments available. Based on this, it seems reasonable to recommend NP RVP\u2010PCR prior to performing bronchoscopy with BAL when respiratory viral infection is suspected. However, the clinician must respect the risk for false negative NP RVP\u2010PCR testing and pursue further testing, including BAL, when the clinical suspicion is high.",

The small number of patients obtained retrospectively in an observational manner offers significant limitations. The non\u2010uniform times between obtaining the NP and the BAL samples also present a challenge, as the duration of viral shedding from the respiratory tract likely varies from patient to patient. It is likely that some of these false negative NP RVP\u2010PCRs were due to prolonged time between obtaining NP and BAL samples. Additionally, given the highly sensitive nature of PCR studies, it is probable that non\u2010clinically relevant viruses were discovered. How these positive results should be interpreted is unknown.",
