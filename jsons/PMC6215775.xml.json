            "text": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disease characterized by progressive degeneration of upper motor neurons (UMNs) and lower motor neurons (LMNs) progressing over time to fatal respiratory failure usually in three to 5 years [8, 26]. While about ten percent occur in a Mendelian pattern of inheritance (familial ALS, fALS), the majority of ALS cases (90%) are sporadic (sALS) with no known genetic cause. The etiology of sALS and the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration remain elusive [47]. At present, there is no cure for ALS, a dearth of effective therapeutic targets, and no broadly used molecular biomarkers to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, there are currently no available animal models for experimentation in the pathophysiology of sALS. However, several lines of evidence implicate a central role for perturbed RNA homeostasis in both fALS and sALS [29]. (1) Neuronal inclusions containing hyperphosphorylated Trans-Activation Response DNA Binding Protein 43kd (TDP-43) are the most common neuropathological hallmark present in both sporadic and familial ALS [4, 35]. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) responsible for multiple RNA-processing functions including regulation of RNA stability, splicing, and translation [27, 37]. (2) A significant number of fALS causing mutations occur in genes encoding RBPs including TARDBP (TDP-43), FUS (TLS), TAF15, HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPA1 and EWSR1 [42]. (3) The most common genetic cause of ALS is the recently discovered hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72 (C9ALS), where one of the main mechanisms may involve inhibition of RBPs by transcribed toxic RNA and patients exhibit widespread RNA processing alterations [38]. Together, these observations suggest that altered RBP localization and activity are conserved features of motor neuron disease in both fALS and sALS.",

While the lack of animal models for the sporadic form of the disease has shifted the focus of research to monogenic models, an alternative strategy is to interrogate molecular changes occurring in human patient tissues [14]. Prior studies have primarily used two approaches to study postmortem ALS tissues: homogenized bulk tissue and cell type specific-enriched tissues. Homogenized tissues fail to capture the complex heterogeneity of the nervous system in which mainly one neuronal population undergoes degeneration. Meanwhile, cell-enriched profiling selectively examines neuronal RNA pools by dissection [15] or laser capture microdissection (LCM) [12, 13, 22, 39]. Simultaneous profiling of LCM-captured MNs and the immediately surrounding anterior horn tissue have identified robust gene expression differences in the MN compartment that failed to be identified by analyses of the anterior horn, highlighting the lack of appropriate resolution in studies using homogenized bulk tissues [39]. A comprehensive systems-based gene-expression analysis of C9orf72 fALS [12] and a study correlating gene-expression with p62-pathology, a second neuropathological marker for sALS beside TDP-43, has been assessed to further explore disease mechanisms [13]. To date, genome-wide gene expression studies of sALS have not successfully identified useful candidates that explain disease pathology and mechanisms.",

            "text": "Clinical observations suggest that neurodegeneration in ALS begins focally and progresses neuroanatomically over the course of disease. The site of onset and distribution of involvement between UMNs and LMNs are key determinants of phenotype [41] since MNs in anatomical regions distant from the site of onset, while in the path of degradation, often appear to be relatively unaffected or in early stages of degeneration at the time of death [40]. For example, impaired neuronal control of respiratory muscles often occurs early in the clinical course of ALS while other somatic motor functions remain intact [45], and conversely, patients kept alive by maintaining respiratory function on ventilators gradually progress to a locked-in state of total motor control loss [34]. Therefore, sALS is unique in that the degeneration of MNs innervating the respiratory muscles is the critical determinant of survival, whereas other neurodegenerative diseases patients exhibit respiratory distress in more advanced stages of neurodegeneration. Thus, while neuropathology of most degenerative diseases typically progresses uniformly to end-stage neuropathology, in ALS degeneration is dispersed three-dimensionally [40] and staging of ALS neuropathology is currently based on the anatomical distribution of pTDP-43 inclusions, not chronological progression [7].",

Here we have isolated surviving MNs from the lumbar spinal region of sALS patients with rostral onset and caudal disease progression and relatively early respiratory failure by LCM and profiled gene expression by RNA-sequencing. We applied a stringent analytical approach to identify unique transcriptomic signatures predictive of sALS histopathology. Comparison of transcriptomic and histopathologic data revealed that mRNA expression levels of the kinase CSNK1E were highly correlated to phospho-TDP43 (pTDP-43) pathology. Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (eCLIP) [49] demonstrated that TDP-43 bound to the 3\u2032 UTR of CSNK1E RNA, which was upregulated in sALS, and loss of TDP-43 function in vitro led to altered CSNK1E mRNA levels. CK1E protein encoded by CSNK1E displays protein\u2013protein interaction with TDP-43 and increased expression of CSNK1E resulted in an increase in TDP-43 phosphorylation. Thus, we exploited unique features of sALS neurodegeneration to elucidate interplay between gene expression changes, TDP-43 and its phosphorylation directly in affected sALS patient tissue. These observations provide an alternative approach to uncover mechanisms underlying sALS pathology, and identify CK1E as a possible therapeutic target modulating TDP-43 phosphorylation.",

Tissue collections were completed within 6 h, usually within 4 h, of death and the entire motor system was dissected and archived for downstream applications by creating two parallel tissue sets from alternating adjacent regions. For molecular studies, segments were embedded in cutting media, frozen on blocks of dry ice and stored at \u2212 70 C.

Briefly, the frozen frontal cortex was homogenized in liquid nitrogen and UV-cross linked in PBS. Afterwards, the tissue was frozen again and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C for further processing. An equal amount of tissue from the five donors (ctrl, n = 2; sALS, n = 3) was lysed, sonicated and cleared. TDP-43 was immunoprecipitated on Dynabeads using an anti-TDP-43 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., A303-223A). After transfer on nitrocellulose, a 70 kDa fragment (beginning from 40 kDa) was cut from the membrane of the IP and the respective size-matched input (SMinput) control. Sequencing libraries were sequenced with 50 bp paired-end sequencing at a depth of ~ 10 million reads for each library. For the analysis, reads were adapter trimmed and mapped with STAR (v2.4.0i) to the human genome (hg19). Custom scripts were used to remove PCR duplicated reads as previously described [49]. CLIPper was used to call peaks [31]. Peak regions that passed a log2 fold change (reads in IP/reads in input) greater than 1 and a \u2013 log10\np value (determined from a Fisher\u2019s exact test) greater than 2 were kept for downstream analyses. Kvector (https://github.com/olgabot/kvector) was used to count 6-mers in all peaks that passed filtering criteria (-log10\np value > 2, log2 fold change > 2 over input). 6-mers were also counted from a random shuffled background list of peaks with the same genic distribution as foreground peaks. The frequency of occurrence for each 6-mer was compared in the foreground and background using a Z test. 6-mers that are in the top 5 Z scores of any dataset were identified as the most highly enriched and are included on the plot in Fig. S7a (Online Resource 12). For the cross-comparison, significant peaks were assigned to genes using the gencode annotation. First, the transcripts of controls and sALS were overlapped within their respective group, generating a set of transcripts consistently bound in either controls or sALS. Subsequent identification of the overlap between the two groups resulted in a gene set significantly bound by TDP-43 in all five samples. This set was considered highly conserved and used for further downstream applications for overlap between TDP-43 binding and pTDP-43 correlating genes. To estimate if the remaining genes, not bound consistently in all samples, are part of a biological effect or rather due to heterogeneity, the sets were sequentially overlapped with each sample (conserved in controls with all sALS samples, and vice versa).",

We found that essentially all genes in our neuronal panel were enriched in the LCM-isolated MN samples over the HEK293T cells and exhibit a similar pattern as the iPSC-derived MNs.

These 1000 transcripts show highly enriched immune GO terms (Fig. 2c, right side) and are significantly enriched in immune and wounding-related transcripts (16.6% of the top 1000 genes, fivefold more than random; P value = 5.11*10\u221270).

We reanalyzed the reduced RNA-seq data (minus top 1000 PC1high genes) with DESeq 2 and observed 370 differentially expressed (DE) genes (330 upregulated and 40 downregulated, Log2FC > 1 and an adj.

We found that the distribution of correlation coefficients resulted in a positively skewed (skewed towards right) distribution. Out of all transcripts detected in the dataset (before subtraction of confounding immune genes), 291 genes were highly correlated (r > 0.8) with pTDP-43 pathology, while only 10 genes showed a strong negative correlation in patients [r < \u2212 0.8, Fig. 4a and Data S2c (Online Resource 10)]. A randomly chosen set of genes illustrated a lack of correlation with pTDP-43 pathology (Fig. 4a, grey curve). In contrast, when correlated with morphologically assessed MN death [Figs. 3c and S5a (Online Resource 9)], we identified only 11 genes that passed our threshold [r > |0.8|, Fig. S6a (Online Resource 11) and Data S2d (Online Resource 10)]. Interestingly, when these pTDP-43-burden correlated genes are compared to a published set of genes correlating with p62-inclusions as a different neuropathological measure of ALS [13], we only observed an overlap of two genes, raising the possibility of different mechanisms leading to the histopathological hallmarks [Fig S6b (Online Resource 11)].\n",

We used enhanced UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) in the frontal cortex of two healthy controls and three sALS patients to profile the transcriptome-wide RNA targets bound specific RBPs. eCLIP requires a high cell count, therefore motor cortices which have a higher density of surviving neurons in ALS cases were chosen over spinal cord. The technique features a size-matched input control, enabling the ranked identification of RNA binding sites and RNA substrates above background. Motif analysis of RNA binding sites of TDP-43 confirmed the known GU-rich TDP-43 binding motif in all samples [Fig. S7a (Online Resource 12)]. We found 351 genes (log2FC > 1, P value < 0.01) that show conserved TDP-43 binding in both control and sALS groups [Fig. 4b, Venn diagram and Data S2e (Online Resource 10)]. To estimate if there is any overt tissue-wide loss of TDP-43 RNA binding activity in sALS, we estimated the transcripts bound only by controls [Fig. 4b, blue part of Venn diagram and Data S2f and S2g (Online Resource 10)] or sALS [Fig. 4b, red part of Venn diagram and Data S1h, S2i and S2j (Online Resource 10)] that represent a true loss of TDP-43 binding (and not biological heterogeneity) by analyzing each biological replicate in the control group vs. each biological replicate in the sALS group (pair-wise analysis). Interestingly, only 12 transcripts that were uniquely bound by TDP-43 in controls showed a loss of binding in sALS samples suggesting that analysis of specific cellular populations and not whole brain regions is more likely to uncover any loss of the RNA-binding capability of TDP-43 in sALS (Fig. 4b, pie charts) given the tissue heterogeneity of the frontal cortex.",

Intriguingly, the top candidate was CSNK1E, a kinase that is implicated in TDP-43 phosphorylation [11, 23]. Indeed, regression analysis of pTDP-43 status in the respective patient lumbar spinal cord alone explained more than 93% of the variance in CSNK1E expression levels in sALS (Fig. 4d).

A very strong binding in the 3\u2032 UTR of CSNK1E is also observed in ENCODE (K562 cell line) eCLIP datasets [49] [Fig. S7b (Online Resource 12)] and in a previously published mouse brain dataset [37] [Fig. S7c (Online Resource 12)]. To further assess the possibility of RNA-binding capabilities of phospho-TDP-43, we artificially induced TDP-43 phosphorylation in iPSC-derived MNs using a previously published combination of ethacrynic acid and tacrolimus [Fig. S8 (Online Resource 13)] [28]. After UV-cross-linking, RNase digestion, and radiolabeling RNA with P-32 we were only able to pull down RNA in treated (induction of TDP-43 phosphorylation) but not non-treated samples using a pTDP-43 specific antibody, suggesting that the phosphorylated TDP-43 indeed binds RNA (Fig. 4f). Combined, our findings are consistent with previous eCLIP data in revealing that TDP-43 binds to the 3\u2032UTR of CSNK1E and suggest a functional role of TDP-43, and potentially even pTDP-43 in regulating CSNK1E mRNA levels.",

Next, we performed immunoprecipitation with an antibody against TDP-43, followed by western blot for CK1E to determine whether TDP-43 protein directly associated with CK1E in MNs differentiated from iPSC lines from three healthy individuals and one fALS patient with a TDP-43 N352S mutation. Indeed, we found co-immunoprecipitation of CK1E in all four samples (Fig. 6b). Finally, to determine if CK1E upregulation increases TDP-43 phosphorylation and aggregation, we generated three separate iPSC-derived MN lines (iPSC-MN) from healthy donors stably expressing CSNK1E via lentiviral transduction (Fig. S11 (Online Resource 16)]. Remarkably, CK1E overexpression resulted in significantly more TDP-43 cytoplasmic accumulations compared to mock transfected MNs in each cell line (Fig. 6c, d).

Not surprisingly, a strong activation of the immune system including microglia was identified which was confirmed histologically. The microglial marker gene CX3CR1 was highly upregulated. CX3CR1 protein is the juxtacrine receptor for fractalkine localized on the plasma membrane of neurons and is believed to have a disease-modifying role in humans [30] and a protective role in the SOD1 G93A ALS mouse model [26]. We found significant upregulation of markers of adaptive immune cells such as CD4, CD22 and CXCR4 [Data S1a (Online Resource 2)], suggesting infiltration of peripheral immune cells such as T-lymphocytes. T-lymphocytes appear to play a protective role in SOD1 G93A mouse models [6, 10]. Additionally, a strong enrichment of complement system genes was detected among the upregulated dataset, including C1QB, C1QC and C3 [Data S1a (Online Resource 2)]. Complement system involvement is implicated in neuromuscular junctions [5] and spinal cords of ALS patients [46] before. Interestingly, our data indicates an increase in expression of the F3 tissue factor, the major initiating protease in the blood coagulation cascade. Vascular changes and blood-CNS barrier impairment causing microhemorrhages have been reported in SOD1 ALS previously [16, 17, 43], making this an interesting area for further analysis in the sporadic form of the disease. The presence of components of immune system in the ALS CNS is previously documented [3, 25, 48]. Identification of immune cells and their receptors that interact with neuronal ligands may help in therapeutic development of neurodegenerative conditions similar to cancer immunotherapy. Our study provides an important resource of gene-expression signatures of immune cells that may physically interact with MNs.",

Increased immunoreactivity of progranulin (PGRN), the GRN gene product, is observed in MNs of sALS patients [21]. Since PGRN is also extensively expressed in microglia and upregulated in sALS patients [36], our observation of GRN mRNA levels could be a result of increased number of microglia surrounding MNs. Another possible reason for increased GRN levels could be altered regulation of its mRNA by TDP-43 [37]. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which TDP-43 mediates GRN mRNA stabilization. However, this is consistent with the previous observation of increased GRN mRNA levels in TDP-43 knockdown mouse striatum [37].",

Despite these issues, we are able to do this in ALS due to the unique anatomical progression, death by respiratory failure, and ready identifications of MNs. Using a set of 370 differentially expressed genes [Data S1d (Online Resource 2)] in a dataset adjusted for confounders as described above, we characterized sALS based on an individual gene expression signature. After filtering immune-related genes, lumbar MNs from rostral onset sALS patients fell into two groups based on individual patient gene expression profiles, and importantly, the group correlating better with control subjects was found to have a significantly lower pTDP-43 burden, consistent with the hypothesis that these MNs were in relatively early stages of degeneration.",

Therefore, we noted two exceptions: control nervous system (#44) clustered closely with the \u2018mild\u2019 gene expression disease group, and one sALS patient (#84) that showed low pTDP-43 burden was classified as \u2018severe\u2019. Since aging was a significant GO term in our dataset, and control 44 is 80 years old (second oldest control individual in our cohort, Table 1), the clustering towards mild sALS might be due to an \u201caging\u201d signature. Although sALS 84 did not cluster in the mild sALS group, it had higher correlation coefficients compared with the control samples than most of the other patients in the severe group. Clearly, greater sample numbers, stratification by UMN and LMN clinical disease burdens, better age-matched controls, and deeper sequencing in the future will explain such discrepancies that could be due to either false positives, aging, or genetic modifiers. A future independent validation of this gene set in a second patient cohort will solidify the validity of our classifier. More stringent criteria and reproducible measurements that define the two sALS classes (mild and severe gene expression) are required to establish precise high-throughput sequencing based molecular diagnostic marker panels.",

When we compared the datasets between our (pTDP43 vs. gene-expression) and the aforementioned report (p62 vs. gene-expression), there was an overlap of only two transcripts. This observation may be explained by the fact that in contrast to p62, TDP-43 is an RBP, directly contributing to RNA expression changes in ALS. In addition, there were differences in the spinal cord region that was analyzed. While the current study focuses largely on the lumbar spinal cord in sALS patients who had rostral onset and caudal disease spread, the Cooper-Knock et al. report evaluated cervical spinal cords of lumbar-onset patients with rostral spread. Additionally, Cooper-Knock et al. utilized an equal number of C9orf72 and sporadic ALS patients in their study and a recent publication suggests differential transcriptome expression in the frontal cortex of C9orf72 ALS patients in comparison to sALS patients [38].",

Our top candidate using this approach was casein kinase 1 epsilon (CSNK1E). RNA expression levels of CSNK1E exhibited the highest correlation with pTDP-43 status in sALS nervous systems (R2 = 0.93) and we also showed for the first time that TDP-43 binds the 3\u2032 UTR of CSNK1E mRNA by eCLIP-seq of TDP-43 in frontal cortex. Additionally, we showed that TDP-43 loss of function results in reduced CSNK1E levels. It was surprising at first that our patient dataset revealed upregulation of CSNK1E mRNA in sALS whereas TDP-43 knockdown showed a decrease in the CSNK1E mRNA levels. However, it appeared plausible considering a recent study of TDP-43 knock-down in mice and an ALS mouse model expressing \u0394NLS-TDP-43 (cytoplasmic overexpression and localization combined with nuclear loss of function) also showed altered gene expression in opposite directions [2]. Combined with our finding that pTDP-43 itself binds RNA, this supports toxic effects of cytoplasmic, pathological and phosphorylated TDP-43 on target RNAs in sALS separate from nuclear loss of function. Therefore, it is likely that disease models that increase cytoplasmic localization and aggregation combined with nuclear loss of TDP-43 function will better represent ALS [50].",
