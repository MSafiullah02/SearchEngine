According to the prospect theory, rare events tend to be overweighed in the absence of a risk-learning process with repeated experience (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). Glaeser (2004) also notes that people may put enormous weight on ephemeral situations. Even under low-risk circumstances, a rare but \u201csharp\u201d event can induce individuals to overestimate risk and exaggerate perceived risk (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974, Slovic, 1987, Viscusi, 1989, Viscusi, 1990). In this paper, we use the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China to analyze if the occurrence of the tremor results in an excessive fear of living in upper floors.",

The level of perceived risk, however, may be further dictated by the floor level where you live as people may feel safer at lower floor apartments in the occurrence of another earthquake. Individuals may prefer to live in lower floors as shocks are felt stronger in upper floors. Similarly, although individuals in the first floors may exit the building faster, people in lower floors are not always more likely to not get injured or survive. Our identification strategy relies on these likely variations in earthquake risk perceptions by floor level to evaluate the pricing behavior of units in lower versus upper floors and assess whether the observed pricing patterns are in line with an excessive fear of heights. Consistent with this overreaction hypothesis, risk perception biases should trigger a rise in the relative price of lower to upper floor units after the earthquake, but this increase should fade over time as the fear of risk gradually dissipates when people realize that the recurrence probability of a high magnitude tremor is small (Kreps, 1984, Wood et al., 1992).",

We further find, however, that the relative price of low to high floor units, particularly units located in floors 1\u20132, significantly increased for several months after the earthquake and after approximately one year returned back to the levels observed prior to the tremor.

Wong uses a panel of housing estates in Hong Kong and does not find evidence, when compared to the predictions of a standard asset-pricing model, of an excessive reaction of prices in secondary residential properties after the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic.3\nAbadie and Dermisi use a quarterly panel of buildings in downtown Chicago and conclude that office location decisions (vacancy rates) appear to have been affected by the increased perception of terrorist risk after the 9/11 attacks.4\n",

These data allow us to concentrate on price differentials before and after the earthquake of comparable housing units located in lower- versus upper-floor levels and assess whether the observed relative pricing patterns can be linked to likely variations in the level of perceived earthquake risk and fear. Focusing on relative price differences further helps us to better control for other unobserved changes (if any) in housing demand and supply factors affecting prices, provided that these changes occur across all apartments and not in units located at specific floor levels. For instance, we do not expect systematic variations in the quality of the structures and the amenities of units located in lower versus upper floors. Still, we recognize that our analysis is based on a before-after comparison such that we cannot completely rule out alternative explanations to the results obtained, but we are also unaware of other plausible explanations.",

In several situations, being able to exit a building in a faster and easier way can significantly increase your chances of survival; for example, when there is a fire or gas leak in the building or in the case of an explosion or terrorist attack such as the 9/11 events where height was a crucial determinant of surviving.8\nIn the case of earthquakes, however, people in lower floors are not always more likely to not get injured or survive. First, as pointed by the Earthquake Country Alliance, research on injuries and fatalities during earthquakes and the experiences of search and rescue teams, indicate that building collapse is generally less of a danger as a small number of buildings partially or completely fail.9\nYou are safer finding shelter inside your apartment rather than trying to run for exits, doorways or jumping from a window; moving during a tremor puts you at more risk as the shaking can be so strong that it is very difficult to move far enough without falling down and objects also fall (areas near the exterior walls of a building are actually the most dangerous places). Second, even if a building fails, dynamic forces and the direction and frequency of shaking are unpredictable such that displacements and structure failures can occur at any floor. Similarly, while some buildings may collapse sideways others may collapse downwards (\u201cpancaking\u201d) where the first floors get demolished by the weight of the upper floors falling and this occurs over a very short period of time.10\nOverall, in several cases you are equally safe (or unsafe) no matter the floor you are located at.",

For about three months (July through September 2008), the price of units in the first two floors were even similar to the price of units in the seventh floor or above, a pattern that was never observed prior to the earthquake. Second, there was a general decrease in the average price differences between upper and lower level units during the entire second half of 2008. The average differences between prices in floors 7 or above versus floors 1\u20132 and 3\u20136 reduced from 450\u2013490 RMB to 230\u2013340 RMB per square meter; the price differences did not return to previous levels until February 2009 and then remained through December 2010.",

First, housing prices generally decreased after the earthquake, which is consistent with previous studies evaluating the impact of hazardous events on property values (e.g., Brookshire et al., 1985, Murdoch et al., 1993, Bin and Polasky, 2004, Nakagawa et al., 2009). This negative effect is associated with the direct risks and self-insuring behavior of consumers for living in hazardous areas. Second, from column (1), we find that the earthquake seems to have had a higher (negative) impact on the prices of upper than lower floor units. On average, prices decreased by additional 0.2 percentage points for each additional floor level. The floor-level premium of 0.2% essentially vanished after the earthquake.22\nThird, from column (2), we observe a general and significant increase after the earthquake in the prices of units in floors 1\u20132 and 3\u20136 relative to units in floors 7 or above. Prior to the earthquake, the price of apartments in floors 1-2 was not statistically different from the price of units in floors 7 or above; after the earthquake, the price of lower-level units were on average 2.6% higher. We also find an important increase in the relative price of units in floors 3\u20136 (from \u22123.1% to \u22120.2%).

In monetary terms, this is equivalent to 50\u2013670 RMB of net gains per square meter or 5,300-71,300 RMB per unit. In the West area, the net gains could have ranged between 250\u20131050 RMB per square meter or 26,400-111,000 RMB per unit. These estimations, which exclude potential gains from leverage, raise doubts on the extent of no-market arbitrage in the housing market.30\n",

However, since we focus on relative prices, likely unobserved changes on housing demand or supply factors would be accounted for as long as these changes occurred across all apartment units and not among units located in specific floor levels. For example, agents\u2019 overall expectations towards property values in disaster (hazardous) areas should be controlled for. Similarly, we do not expect systematic variations in the amenities included in upper versus lower units, although we cannot directly account for this.31\nThe subsidy policy did not affect the size distribution and relative prices of units across different floor levels.32\nEven the apparent decrease in the available stock of new upper-level units, relative to lower-levels units, due to the slowdown in the construction of high-rise buildings in Chengdu after the earthquake, should have moved relative prices in the opposite direction to what we observe, which provides additional support to our findings.33\n",

The tremor not only caused severe property damage and casualties, but raised the awareness of potential earthquake risks among Chengdu residents. We rely on likely variations in the level of perceived risk by floor level, triggered after the earthquake, to evaluate the relative pricing patterns of apartment units in lower versus upper floors and assess whether the observed pricing behavior is consistent with an excessive fear of heights. We use an extensive transaction dataset of new residential apartments purchased across Chengdu over a period of one year before and one year after the earthquake.",

However, the relative price of units in lower to upper floors, especially units in the first two floors, significantly increased for several months after the earthquake and then returned back to the levels observed prior to the tremor. We find this temporal increase in relative prices supportive of an increased risk perception and fear of living in upper floors, which eventually dissipated over time. The results are robust to alternative model estimations. Overall, the results suggest an apparent excessive fear of heights after the tremor.",

The fact that the relative price increase carried on for several months casts doubts on the efficiency of the housing market and the extent of no-market arbitrage, and should not be overlooked given the importance of housing in the Chinese household wealth portfolio (41% of total household assets according to the Chinese Household Finance Survey (2011)). In the event of a future similar disaster, a public program that stimulates the demand for units in upper floors (instead of only offering subsidies for smaller units) could probably help to address this unusual relative price behavior. Certainly, this price behavior can be regarded as irrational to the extent that there is an overestimation of perceived risks relative to actual risks as we move to upper floors, although we admit that subjective risks are difficult to quantify. Finally, we acknowledge that our study relies on a before-after comparison in the affected areas so we cannot fully discard alternative interpretations to our results, but we are also unaware of other probable explanations.",
