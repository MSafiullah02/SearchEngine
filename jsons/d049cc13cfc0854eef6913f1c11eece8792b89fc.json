            "text": "The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) Guidelines have typically been followed as the minimum technical requirements for performing neurodiagnostic studies, including the conduction of electroencephalograms (EEGs) (ACNS Guidelines 1, 3 and 5) (Acharya et al. 2016; Kuratani et al. 2016; Sinha et al. 2016) . Such guidelines acknowledge that there is \"no single best method\" of performing a neurodiagnostic procedure for every circumstance, but they offer \"standards considered minimum for the usual clinical recording.\" . Given the increasing neurological sequelae in many COVID-19 positive patients Mao et al. 2020; Rabin April 1, 2020; Li et al. 2020; Talan March 27, 2020; Talan April 1, 2020b; Gupta et al. in preparation) , it is the opinion of the authors that the use of neurodiagnostic testing may increase. It is department policy to adhere to standard infection prevention measures when performing neurodiagnostic procedures on both normal and infected patient populations (Bonner and Davidson 2020) . However, the ability to perform such tests may be limited due to the highly contagious nature of the virus (CDC April 2, 2020), which ultimately led our facility to adhere to stricter airborne isolation protocols. These stricter protocols require the use of PPE, including face masks, face shields, gloves and gowns, which were of the limited supply (CDC March 31, 2020a) . In this article, the authors share our experience with performing a bedside-continuous video-EEG study (cvEEG) on a patient with COVID-19, while adhering to ACNS guidelines. We then offer proposed changes to our procedures and protocols to accommodate resource limitations and the safety of EEG technologists.",

Other limitations of this time analysis include the small sample size as we compared only one test in each category done by a single EEG technologist.

The increased neurological sequelae seen with COVID-19 will likely increase the need for neurodiagnostic studies, such as EEG. Our experience with performing a cvEEG following our standard procedures and protocols lead to increased concern of potentially unnecessary patient exposure time. The modified protocols and procedures have limited the studies to be done only on selected patients. In addition, for these studies, the authors believe the modifications will lead to a reduced exposure time without a clinically relevant compromise in EEG quality. Based on previous studies, the reduced electrode array has been shown to have high specificity but limited sensitivity Westover et al. 2020) . The electrode choice is an evolving process for us, and additional electrodes could be applied as needed. Other options to consider are the use of subhairline arrays, disposable EEG caps or bands. The authors want to emphasize that the modifications will likely continue to evolve with experience. We hope that this manuscript stimulates ideas and collaboration. In the end, our goal is to continue to deliver high quality patient care while decreasing patient exposure times and optimizing resource utilization; this will allow us to not only take care of patients but take care of each other as well. Stay safe. KEY CONSIDERATIONS 1. Length and proximity of EEG staff exposure: For patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, we have seen conflicting guidance as to whether droplet precautions are sufficient or whether higher-level \"airborne precautions\" are necessary. EEG technologists can typically take 30 minutes to 1 hour to set up and 20 minutes to remove leads while in close proximity to a patient's head/face. For long term EEG, the possibility of multiple entrances over time to a patient room is a consideration as well. Please refer to \"Revised EEG Recording Process\" for a modified process and procedures in performing an EEG on a patient. 2. Current and projected COVID-19 cases in the facility and region: Adhere to current hospital recommendations at the time of study. 3. Supply of PPE available to the facilities in the system: Adhere to current hospital recommendations at the time of study. 4. Staffing availability: The Epilepsy Program Manager or Manager of Neurodiagnostics and Epilepsy will determine which Technologist will perform the procedure. A risk assessment of each available employee will be performed by the Epilepsy Program Manager or Manager of Neurodiagnostics and Epilepsy to determine the appropriate person to perform the procedure (CDC March 31, 2020) . Experienced EEG Technologists will be preferred to perform procedures on these patients as a high level of judgement/critical thinking skills, experience in recording the waveforms, and assessing the criticality of the situation is needed in this setting to provide the highest quality, most efficient patient care and decrease staff exposure time to the patient. If for some reason an appropriate EEG Technologist is not available, then performing the procedure may be delayed until an appropriate EEG Technologist is available. 5. Urgency of procedure: For a neurodiagnostic test to be performed, a Medical Justification form (Figure 1 ) needs to be filled out by the ordering patient care team, approved/cleared by the interpreting neurologist, and placed in the patient chart. 6. Health and age of the patient, especially given the risks of concurrent COVID-19 infection during recovery.",
