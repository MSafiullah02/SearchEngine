T2-weighted sagittal images were also obtained (TR 4000, TE 119.0, 3.0 mm). Postintravenous contrast T1W images were obtained in all three standard planes approximately 5 min postmanual intravenous injection of gadolinium-based contrast (transverse, sagittal, and dorsal: TR 600, TE 11.5, 5.0 mm) (0.12 mmol/kg bodyweight, gadoteridol [Pro-Hance; Bracco Diagnostic, Inc., Township, NJ]). Field of view for all images was 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm, except for the T1W postcontrast dorsal sequence that had a field of view of 21 cm \u00d7 21 cm. Multifocal ill-defined, small regions of hyperintensity were identified on T2W images, primarily in the gray matter at the following locations: both piriform lobes, the caudate nucleus bilaterally, the region of the caudal aspect of the right hippocampus, the ventromedial aspect of the frontal lobe bilaterally, and ventral to the rostral aspect of the lateral ventricles bilaterally (Figs. 1C, 2A, C) . These regions were hyperintense on FLAIR and iso-to slightly hypointense on T1W images (Figs. 1D, 2B, D). No abnormal regions of intravenous contrast enhancement were identified. Hyperintensity was noted in the region of the left olfactory bulb on T2W images; this was hyperintense on FLAIR images. This region was hypointense on T1W images pre-and postintravenous contrast (Figs. 1A, B, 3A, B). No regions of signal void were identified on GE images. No abnormalities were identified in the portion of the cervical spine included on the sagittal images.

Although FSRA is multisystemic, the lesions are most similar to RAE in people. 1, 2 The clinical signs of FSRA are variable, but commonly include an acute onset of dyspnea, lethargy, and spontaneous death, 1 similar to the patient described in this report. There is an apparent predilection for male cats. 1 As death appears imminent, treatment at this time is unknown.",

A report of intravascular lymphoma in the brain of a 10-year old Rottweiler-German Shepard cross demonstrated multifocal hyperintensities on T2-weighted images, FLAIR, and precontrast T1-weighted images, being most apparent on FLAIR images. 8 These hyperintensities were located in the thalamus, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and mesencephalic tegmentum. Administration of intravenous contrast yielded mild enhancement of these lesions as well as identification of an additional lesion in the claustrum. 8 Noncontrast enhanced MR images of the 7-year-old Siamese with intravascular lymphoma revealed asymmetry in the cerebral cortices with hyperintensities in the right cerebral cortex on T2 and proton density images, as well as thickened/poorly defined gyri in that location. 6 These intravascular lymphoma patients differ from the patient in this report in that this patient did not have enhancing lesions, did not have cerebral asymmetry, and was ultimately not diagnosed with lymphoma.",

The cause of the T2 hyperintensities may be related to infarction from small vessel occlusion with fibrin thrombosis found on necropsy, and though numerous additional lesions were present on necropsy they were not appreciated on MR images. The cause for the mild dilation of the left rostral horn of the lateral ventricle is unknown, though it may be a normal variant. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal sonographic findings were relatively unremarkable aside from the slightly thickened small bowel with a prominent muscularis layer. Though this can be seen with chronic enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or lymphoma among others, in this case, it may have been due to the vasculopathy from FSRA. 7 The cytologic and PCR evidence of a Mycoplasma infection in this patient is thought to be an incidental, unrelated finding.",
