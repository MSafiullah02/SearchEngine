            "text": "APN is expressed in many tissues including intestine, kidney, liver as well as the central nervous system 1, 2. The enzyme is involved in the final hydrolysis of nutrients and the degradation of bioactive molecules such as tuftsin and cytokines 3, 4, 5. Furthermore, APN serves as a receptor for corona viruses 6, 7, and it is possibly involved in processes of antigen presentation [8]. Recently, Saiko and co-workers have shown that the CD13 antigen is involved in the regulation of tumour-cell invasion and the degradation of extracellular matrix [9]. In the diagnostic of hematopoietic malignant disorders APN is used as a routine marker for myelomonocytic cells 3, 10. Other cells such as lymphocytes and related cell lines are predominantly CD13-negative 1, 10, 11. However, there are several reports describing the occurrence of neutral aminopeptidase activities in or on these cells. Amoscato and co-workers reported on Ala-pNA-hydrolysing activity located on the cell surface of lymphoid cell lines [12]. Other reports extended these findings showing that APN is expressed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and on lymphoid T cell lines as well 13, 14. It was also shown that the CD13 antigen is frequently expressed on the surface of malignant B cells [15], on T lymphocytes derived from inflamed tissues [16]as well as on mitogen activated T cells [17].",

Total cellular activities measured in the lysate of lymphoid cell lines were in the range of 23 to 172 pkat/106 cells. In comparison with the corresponding activity of peripheral T cells (12 pkat/106 cells), related cell lines showed substantially higher aminopeptidase activities (Table 1\n). The CD13-positive histiocytic cell line U937-H contained 63 pkat/106 cells Ala-pNA hydrolysing activity. Surprisingly, some of the CD13-negative lymphoid cell lines such as the B cell line Daudi, the T cell lines H9, PC12-Ichikawa, and the weakly CD13-expressing T cell line Karpas contained higher neutral aminopeptidase activities than U937-H cells (Table 1). The majority of this activity expressed in lymphoid cells as well as in the CD13-negative U937-L cells is located in the soluble fraction. In the case of U937-H cells, 63% of the enzymatic activity were detected in the particulate fraction, whereas most other cells contained only small (Daudi, PC12-Ichikawa, Karpas) or neglectable amounts (Jurkat, H9, HuT78, U937-L, peripheral T cells) of Ala-pNA-hydrolysing activity in this fraction (Table 1).",

This result strongly underlines that the Ala-\u03b2NA hydrolysing activity with an IP of 4.8 which is expressed in H9 cells represents APN.

As we showed previously, the species with an IP of 4.8 represents the membrane-bound APN in U937-H cells [14]. Although we used different monoclonal antibodies, we did never detect CD13-immunoreactivity of the enzyme form with an IP of 4.8 in lymphoid cells. Perhaps, this effect could be explained by the weak APN expression in lymphoid cells. Recent biochemical studies using inhibitors and the inhibitory monoclonal anti-CD13 antibody WM15 underlined the different nature of the two neutral aminopeptidase activities, but they do not definitively answer the question, whether both enzyme species represent APN. The detection of additional aminopeptidase activities in the lymphoid cells is in agreement with data from other groups. Favaloro and co-workers [27]have shown that only 20\u201340% of the total neutral aminopeptidase activity of acute myeloid or lymphoid leukaemic cells could be attributed to APN. The authors discussed a high complexity of the protease expression pattern of the malignant clones. Using the inhibitory monoclonal antibody WM15 they obtained quite similar results concerning neutral aminopeptidase expression of peripheral T cells [20]. Interestingly, Belhacene and co-workers showed that aminopeptidase B is the main aminopeptidase activity of the T cell line Jurkat [19]. Furthermore, Murray and co-workers described an aminopeptidase activity of Jurkat cells which has to be distinguished from APN [18].",

Functioning of our antisense model was confirmed by transfecting CD13-positive U937-H cells. The strong reduction of CD13-immunoreactivity on the antisense transfectants U937.16 as well as the complete absence of the enzyme species with IP between 3.5 and 4.8 in these cells demonstrate the capability of our antisense system to in inhibit cellular APN expression. Furthermore, the observed variability concerning the isoelectric points (between 3.5 and 4.8) implies that the APN-derived activity represents more than one enzyme species. For the first time, the occurrence of different molecular forms of the APN was shown in an enzymatic assay. The heterogeneity observed could be caused by a different extent of glycosylation as shown by O'Connell and co-workers. They demonstrated that changes in the glycosylation pattern of the APN expressed on HUVE-cells create five APN subpopulations defined by different CD13 monoclonal antibodies [26].",

Therefore, the high neutral aminopeptidase activity expressed in H9 cells has to be attributed to another enzyme. The induction of this activity observed in the U937-H transfectants could be considered, perhaps, as a `by pass phenomenon' or `compensation' which is occasionally observed in `knock out' experiments 30, 31.",

This increase is, however, always associated with the appearance of CD13-immunoreactivity on the cell surface.
