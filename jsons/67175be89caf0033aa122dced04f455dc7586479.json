Indeed, there are suggestions that the refugees might not be reporting infections due to 1) lack of knowledge in regards to infection and symptoms, 2) lack of access to tests, which are already limited and insufficient for the needs of the hosting communities, and 3) fear of stigma which might lead to increasing restrictions and crackdown on the refugees. COVID-19 has ignited fears in many communities and reactions to patients or potential carriers of the virus are not always charitable. Furthermore, it is well known that certain hosting countries established curfews and implanted deportations of unregistered refugees even before the onset of the pandemic. Therefore, tackling the spread of COVID-19 in the refugee camps appears to be complicated and fraught with many complications.",

These measures in any community have proven difficult, but they might be even more challenging in Syrian refugee camps. Indeed, it is widely known that many refugee populations that witnessed catastrophic events might be immunosuppressed and can carry multidrug resistant pathogens [2] , while the camps also host elderly refugees, which are particularly susceptible to COVID-19. Furthermore, populations of refugees live under crowded conditions in makeshift tents that provide little protection, while camps may share common services, which render distancing very difficult. Furthermore, the quality and availability of water (drinking and domestic) in many camps are insufficient; with intermittent access, shortages and documented contamination with bacterial indicators of fecal pollution and multidrug resistant pathogens [3, 4] . This obviously decreases the efficacy of hygienic practices that rely mainly on sufficient access to clean water and is more problematic in scenarios that also include shared latrines and vulnerable camp water cisterns. Additionally, shortages in-and monopolization and soaring prices of protective gear, disinfectants, virus tests and nutritious food mean that these items will be even more scarcely available for the refugees, which will adversely impact the maintenance a good health.",

Lebanon is currently under a curfew in order to control the disease, and prices of food and medicine are soaring in a country that relies heavily on imports to meet its needs.

A hallmark of this war is the displacement of millions of individuals internally in Syria and across borders to different hosting countries. Today, millions of Syrian war refugees are scattered across several countries and many live under unideal conditions. In many cases, the refugees, including children, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, have comparatively limited access to extended medical help, clean water, and safe and nutritious food, resulting in a chronically stressed population that is prone to various communicable and non-communicable diseases. Amid these challenges and uncertainties, a new and frightening threat has emerged, namely the COVID-19 pandemic, which has rapidly spread across the globe causing severe morbidity and mortality (~ 1,484,811 cases and 88,538 deaths as of April 9 th )[1]. The disease, caused by a new strain of human coronaviruses dubbed SARS-CoV-2, has strained the public health systems and economies of major world powers such as China and the USA. While there has not been reports of major outbreaks or cases in the camps so far, the main hosting countries have witnessed increasing number of infections and fatalities. For example, Turkey reported 38,226 cases and 812 deaths, while Lebanon and Jordan had 576 and 358 cases and 19 and 6",
