Four retrospective Chinese studies were included. Data were collected from patients admitted to Tongji Hospital [4], Renmin Hospital [5], Number 1 Hospital [6], Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital [7]. These studies provided data on 852 patients (489 male and 363 female) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR: 603 survivors and 249 non-survivors.

It has been recommended the early initiation of IVIg and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy to alleviate the hypercoagulable state and improve the prognosis of critical type patients[10].Although different scenarios should be considered when interpreting deaths from COVID-19 including environmental factors and therapeutic limitations, the results of the present study have important implications to make early clinical and laboratory indicators available in relation to the increased risk of death by COVID-19. From their understanding, physicians can make decision practices in critical care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, there is a high number of studies with potential overlapping data which compromise the strength of available evidence. The results of this meta-analysis are based on standard univariate model and further studies without overlapping reports should be published allowing to allow account for confounding factors.",
