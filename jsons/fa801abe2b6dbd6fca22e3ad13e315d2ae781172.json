However, there are also concerns regarding the potential abuse of AI. Many scientists have been worried about the dangers of AI leading to \"biased\" conclusions in part due to the enthusiasm of the inventor or over-enthusiasm by the general public. Here, though, we are considering some scenarios in which people may intend to cause potential errors within data sets of analyzed information, resulting in incorrect conclusions and leading to potential problems with patient care and outcomes.",

            "text": "A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a recently developed deep-learning model aimed at creating new images. It simultaneously trains a generator and a discriminator network, which serves to generate artificial images and to discriminate real vs. artificial images, respectively. We have recently described how GANs can produce artificial images of people and audio content that fool the recipient into believing that they are authentic. As applied to medical imaging, GANs can generate synthetic images that can alter lesion size, location, and transpose abnormalities onto normal exams ( Fig. 1 ) [1] . GANs have the potential to improve image quality, reduce radiation dose, augment data for training algorithms, and perform automated image segmentation [2] . However, there is also the potential for harm if these artificial images infiltrate our healthcare system by hackers with malicious intent. As proof of principle, Mirksy et al. showed that they were able to tamper with CT scans and artificially inject or remove lung cancers on the images. When the radiologists were blinded to the attack, this hack had a 99.2% success rate for cancer injection and a 95.8% success rate for cancer removal. Even when the radiologists were warned about the attack, the success of cancer injection decreased to 70%, but the cancer removal success rate remained high at 90% [3] . This illustrates the sophistication and realistic appearance of such artificial images. These hacks can be targeted against specific patients or can be used as a more general attack on our radiology data. It is already challenging enough to keep up with the daily clinical volume when the radiology system is running smoothly. Our clinical workflow would be paralyzed if we cannot trust the authenticity of the images and must spend extra effort to search for evidence of image tampering on every case.",

Many of our clinicians are transitioning to telemedicine visits, which adds tremendous stress on our networks.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued security warnings about Zoom, and a number of organizations including SpaceX, Google, New York's Department of Education, and the US Senate have banned or discouraged the use of Zoom[8].
