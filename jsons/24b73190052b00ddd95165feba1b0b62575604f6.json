Optimally the plate contained a 1.5 mm thick gel of 1% agarose with 1% red cells and 1 unit/ml gel of complement. 400 ng of SFV was fused to the red cells in 1 ml of the gel (about 20 virions fused to one red cell). Five ~1 of inactivated (56'C, 30 min) serum samples were pipetted into wells in the gel. After 20 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C the diameters of the hemolytic zones were directly proportional to the logarithm of the serum dilution. This made it possible to calculate the antibody titers for the samples using an experimental formula T= 10@lk (T is the titer, d, the diameter in mm and k a variable coefficient, which had to be determined for each batch of the plates using a standard serum). Using regression and residual analyses, the formula was shown to fii the exper~ental results. The fusion-based HIG could be read after as early as 2 h of incubation. The specificity of the test was studied using antisera against Western equine encephalomyelitis, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis, Chlkungunya and Uruma viruses, which all gave negative results in the SFV HIG test.

Conventionally the viral antigens have been attached to the red cells by the agglutination or by fixation with some chemical such as Cr3+ or periodate (Schild et al., 1975; Probert and Russel, 1975; Vb%n%nen et al., 1976; Riski et al., 1977; Gaidamovich et al., 1980) .

Most of the envelope proteins are probably too far from the red cell surface to result in complement-mediated lysis of the cell when antibodies are added. When SFV is fused with the red cell membrane, the envelope proteins become integral parts of the membrane (Vlananen et al., 1981) .
