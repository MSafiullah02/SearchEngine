This variability might contribute to the ability of the virus to cause yearly outbreaks and severe disease.4, 5 Furthermore, previous reports of RSV infection outbreaks have described varying degrees of disease severity, but have not controlled for the presence of different viral genotypes that may have different virulence.",

He was being weaned off oxygen supplementation in the intermediate care unit when cough, runny nose, and fever started. Respiratory failure developed rapidly, requiring MV. Five days later, five infants (out of 17 who were in the NICU) developed respiratory symptoms; therefore, an outbreak was declared (Fig. 2\n). On the same day, NPA samples were collected from all patients in the NICU for RRT-PCR respiratory virus detection. Ten infants were infected with RSV, of whom only three shared the ward with the index case. The attack rate was 58.8%, and only one fatality occurred (CFR = 10%). However, the death was not attributed to RSV infection, since the patient did not present with respiratory symptoms and had congenital pulmonary hypoplasia, which was considered the cause of death.
