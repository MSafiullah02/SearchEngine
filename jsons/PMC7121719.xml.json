Once again it is important to talk about the timing of application. Nobody would consider intubating a patient with a PaO2/FiO2 between 250 and 300, although it is precisely in this category of patient that NIV could act best as prevention to avoid a subsequent worsening. This concept is supported by Cosentini et al. (2010) who used this philosophy in the treatment of patients with pneumonia, ventilating the patients with CPAP through a helmet in the Accident and Emergency department. CPAP delivered by helmet rapidly improved oxygenation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia suffering from a moderate hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. This trial represents a proof-of-concept evaluation of the potential usefulness of CPAP in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.",

A review of the literature leads us to be very prudent concerning the use of NIV. One study always reported as a \u201cpositive\u201d one was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Antonelli and colleagues, who demonstrated that an improvement in oxygenation 1 h after starting treatment could be obtained by using either traditional intubation or NIV, with the latter being associated with a significant reduction in severe complications (Antonelli et al. 1998). The study by Antonelli is certainly robust and well designed and has, therefore, become one of the most frequently cited works in the literature; nevertheless, due care should be taken before generalizing its results. First of all, the study is often referred to as having been carried out in patients with ARDS, whereas only about 25 % of the population studied had this syndrome; furthermore, the study was performed in a single center in a hospital in which the team was particularly experienced in and enthusiastic about NIV, limiting the certainty that the results could be reproduced in every intensive care unit. A Chinese study (Zhan et al. 2012) is probably the first randomized controlled trial comparing NIV versus high-concentration oxygen in patients with mild ARDS, according to the new Berlin definition (i.e., those patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio > 200 < 300). A total of 21 patients were assigned to NIV and 19 to the control group. The proportion of patients requiring intubation was lower in the former group, and there was also a tendency to reduced mortality in this group.",

A multicenter study carried out in three intensive care units with great experience in NIV is particularly interesting: this study demonstrated that, after having excluded a series of patients with hemodynamic instability, those requiring protection of the airways, and patients with severe sensorial disorders or multiorgan failure, it was possible to use NIV in about 65 % of the patient admitted to hospital. Of these cases just under a half had to be intubated subsequently because of a poor response to NIV. These patients were characterized by being male, being older, and having a higher SAPS II score (i. e. >34) and more marked hypoxia on admission (i. e. PaO2/FiO2 < 175). The development of sepsis after starting NIV was associated with a low success rate. So, if we calculate the percentage of patients in whom we can use NIV successfully in real life conditions, this is <20 %, eroding the enthusiasm of even the most optimistic individuals.",

However, once again, a series of problems related to the study should be pointed out, starting with the limited experience that most of the centers involved had with NIV and finishing with the strange results obtained in the control group in which NIV could be used as rescue therapy. The success rate of NIV was greater than 50 % in this subgroup of patients, who were theoretically more severely ill, since they had already failed a trial of medical therapy, than in the group in whom NIV was used immediately.",

Someone is going to have to explain to us where all the hundreds, if not thousands, of patients will be treated. The number of beds in intensive therapy units would clearly be insufficient, as would the availability of the more technologically advanced ventilators; furthermore, intubation is usually performed after sedation and neuromuscular blockade, which can only be done by specialists. We will, therefore, be asked to make dramatic choices between who does or does not \u201cdeserve\u201d treatment.

Of course, all this was obtained by taking the right precautions such as admitting the patients to negative pressure rooms, and supplying the workers with special protective overalls and helmets.
