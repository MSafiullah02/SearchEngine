Indeed, even the decision to rely on markets depends on the nature of the state. Development requires markets underpinned by solid public institutions that protect property rights, regulate market participants, maintain macroeconomic stability, and manage conflict (Rodrik, 2001).",

China lacks the possibility of year-round production in considerable parts of the country.

Arthur Lewis, and former World Bank country director based in India notes that the Chinese state has played a key role in addressing internal structural issues of an overall strategy, secure land titles, human capital, and infrastructure, explaining China's extraordinarily rapid transformation from agriculture, which fits well the Lewis model of unlimited supplies of labor to a modern industrial state. By contrast, in a personal exchange he asked, has democratic India deployed the Lewis model? Beyond fostering markets, the Chinese state has played key roles in rural employment growth; rural poverty reduction; increased food security; education and health access\u2014particularly, of women\u2014and the management of environmental commons with technology, rules and regulations, and community participation. China's agricultural reforms, introduced under Deng Xiaoping and Zhu Rongji (first Vice Premier, later Premier), followed the failures of the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d (1958\u201360) and the Cultural Revolution. The Household Responsibility System was first introduced in agriculture in 1979, and gradually extended to other sectors of the economy. Thus whereas agricultural reforms have been an integral to the overall development strategy in China, agriculture's role in the over strategy has been less clear as we discuss later in Section 2. Also, China's rapid growth in exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) and higher savings and investment, have enabled it to invest massively in physical, human, and institutional capital. This has far exceeded what foreign aid could realistically muster, and in the later period to foster product and factor markets. India's remittances soured from early 1980s until 2011 reaching 4 percent of GDP, compared to China's 0.5 percent of GDP, and they contributed to household expenditures but did not have much impact on public investment.",

Industry share in value-added peaked at 48 percent, remaining higher than India's, with a decline in recent years and a change in the industrial structure. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) created substantial employment for labor released from agriculture, following spectacular productivity growth in the 1980s, but unchecked SOE expansion resulted from local governments' financing enterprises via a combination of sales of land, taxation, and bank borrowing, leading to questions of their efficiency and transparency. Since the 1980s, SOEs have undergone major fiscal and monetary reforms, reining in non-performing bank loans. Many inefficient downstream TVEs in consumer and intermediate sectors have failed, with the remainder aiming to become more efficient and competitive, creating employment while meeting growing consumer demand. SOEs remain dominant in the large-scale heavy industry sector, such as semi-conductors, telecoms, energy, steel, and defense, but there, too, reforms are underway to make them more efficient and productive. Perhaps, the best indicator of competitiveness, manufactured goods accounted for 80 percent of exports in the 1980s, of which labor-intensive goods comprised about two-thirds of manufactured exports. China's export basket has diversified. The share of textiles and clothing in exports has decreased. Exports of high technology machinery, transport equipment, and telecommunication equipment have increased to nearly half of China's exports.

Indeed, the narrative of China's market reforms has been a consistent theme in the literature and among international organizations. The World Bank illustrates the point: \u201cSince initiating market reforms in 1978, China has shifted from a centrally planned to a more market-based economy and has experienced rapid economic and social development.

Growth increased sharply in the first half of the 1980s with the new HRS. Land leases also emerged, shifting user rights from collectives to households. By simply allowing farmers to sell their surplus on the market, increasing procurement prices, and reducing state-mandated quotas, rural per capita incomes tripled between 1978 and 1984. The HRS reforms revealed spectacularly how far below the production possibility frontier that Chinese farmers had been operating before its introduction. The HRS contributed to a surge in GDP growth rate to 14 percent by the mid-1980s. Sicular (1994) discussed the continued quota system and subsidies to grain prices in the 1980s and its gradual reform in the 1990s (see, also, Gulati and Fan, 2007).",

Yet, since 2000, China's support to agriculture increased substantially (Huang et al., 2015; Huang and Yang, 2017). Using OECD's standard method of estimating agricultural assistance, China's agricultural producer subsidies in 2018 amounted to the subsidies of all OECD countries combined (OECD, 2018a, b) (see supplementary Fig. A5). Even considering input subsidies, India's support to agriculture has been negative since 2000.

India's first balance of payments crisis (1958) led to realization within the World Bank of the growing capital needs of a rapidly industrializing India, prompting the establishment in 1960, of the International Development Association (IDA), the concessional window of the World Bank. Developing countries sought aid through the United Nations, but Western donors opted for establishing IDA in the World Bank and providing technical assistance through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (Lele and Goswami, 2020, forthcoming).

The Green Revolution was a success, but agriculture has not continued that success (Lele and Bumb, 1994; Lele and Goswami, 2020). Sukhamoy Chakravarty, India's foremost economist in a speech wondered why Mahalanobis, the architect of India's Second Five Year Plan, had not recognized the key role of agriculture as a source of employment of surplus labor, income, and demand for goods produced in the industrial sector, the so-called Lewis model (Chakravarty, 1983). In addition to industrialization of heavy industry, India pursued a rural industrialization strategy in its first few plans, based on Gandhian ideals, but not so much to create mass production and employment. Chakravarty speculated that overlooking agriculture may have been, perhaps, because agriculture was doing well due to the Green Revolution, starting in the mid-1960s. T. N. Srinivasan (1996) suggested that it had more to do with India's industrialization and trade strategy, influenced by Mahalanobis's Second Five Year Plan. He contended that Mahalanobis's influence on development strategy continued for 35 years. The Planning Commission had indeed prepared a Basic Needs Strategy for India in the mid-1960s amid growing concern about poverty but it was not implemented. Had it been, social indicators would have been better. Those ideas had no traction in India's Five-Year Plans, according to Srinivasan (1996). The Basic Needs strategy, originating in India, according to Srinivasan, was adopted by UNDP.",

The former two adversely affected the private sector's efficiency. The last, with the inefficient functioning of public sector enterprises, impaired additionally the public sector enterprises' contribution to the economy. Together, the three sets of policy decisions broadly set strict limits to what India could get out of its investment\u201d (Bhagwati and Srinivasan, 1993, 46\u20137).",

Investment consisted largely of on-farm investments, primarily in irrigation pumps, and to a lesser degree, in machinery. Overall, investment on the farm remains low, and farmers prefer to allocate more of their disposable incomes to financial savings and expansion of business capital. After almost two decades of sustained expansion (with growth peaking in the early 1990s, at about 3.6 percent), growth decelerated from 1996 to 97 to 2004\u201305, largely due to poor rains, resuming again to 3.5 percent per year before deteriorating again in 2011, also due to poor rains.",
