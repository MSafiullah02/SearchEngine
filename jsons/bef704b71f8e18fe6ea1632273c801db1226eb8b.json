The account reveals that the Queen even paid for a convalescence recommended by the doctors, on which their mother accompanied them. In 1787, Chevalier de Boufflers, a great traveller, brought back to (he Queen from Senegal a parrot . , , and a young negro child. Instead of treating the black child as a little blackamoor, as was customary, and (aking him into her service, Marie Antoinette had him baptized at Notre Dame de Versailles and gave him the Christian names of Jean Amilcar. Muller, one of the Queen's houseboys, was instructed (o look afler him. After lhe days of October, when revolutionary conditions made it difficult to find lodging for him at the Tulleries, Marie Antoinette had him placed in an institution for children at St. Cloud and made monthly payments for him up to August 10th through Monsieur de Salvert. When the monarchy fell and Marie Antoinette was made a prisoner In the Temple, nobody had the charity to look after the black child. Driven from the plate where he boarded, he died of cold and hunger.\"",

Nevertheless, until recently gastro-enteritis provided a poor hunting ground for virologists for, although such viruses as adenoviruses, echoviruses and Coxsackie viruses could be isolated from the stools of patients with acute gastro-enteritis, they could often be recovered with almost equal frequency from those without diarrhoeal disease, particularly in developing countries. However, the examination of negatively stained faecal preparations from patients with gastro-enteritis by electron microscopy has resulted in the discovery of many viruses, some of which, for example, rotaviruses and such parovirus-like viruses as the Norwalk agent, are undoubtedly the cause of acute gastroenteritis. The role of such other viruses as astroviruses, calciviruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses remains as yet to be clearly established. In general, in vitro cultivation of viruses causing gastroenteritis in humans is either not possible or extremely dir'ficult and of little value for routine diagnostic purposes but, since they are often excreted in very high titres, they may be detected without difficulty by electron microscopic examination of faecal extracts.-Banatvala IE: Viruses and Diarrboes, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 73:503, 1979.
