Years of research and practical experience have shown that antibiotic use significantly improves animal performance and health status (Cromwell, 2002). However, the use and misuse of in-feed antibiotics have led to problems with drug residues in animal products and increased bacterial resistance (Khachatourians, 1998). As a result, the sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics has been totally banned in European countries since January 2006 (Casewell et al., 2003) and other countries are seriously considering a similar ban. Therefore, alternatives to antibiotics are urgently needed.",

Under natural conditions, the serum IgY of laying hens is deposited in large quantities in the egg yolk in order to protect the developing embryo from potential pathogens (Janson et al., 1995). Thus, it is possible to immunize the hen against specific foreign pathogens thereby allowing the production of IgY with activity against these specific disease conditions.",

The most significant advantage is that the collection of antibodies is non-invasive. In contrast to conventional methods where animals are often sacrificed in order to collect a sufficient amount of blood to obtain antibodies, production of antibodies in laying hens requires only the collection of eggs, and the high and long-lasting titers produced in chickens reduce the need for frequent booster injections. Another advantage is that due to the phylogenetic distance between chickens and mammals, chickens often more successfully produce antibodies against highly conserved mammalian proteins than do other mammals and require much less antigen to induce an efficient immune response.",

A hen usually lays about 300 eggs per year and the egg yolk (15 ml) contains 50\u2013100 mg of IgY of which 2 to 10% are specific antibodies (Rose et al., 1974). Therefore, one immunized hen produces more than 22,500 mg of IgY per year which is equivalent to the production of 4.3 rabbits over the course of a year (Schade et al., 2005). The maintenance costs for keeping hens are also lower than those for mammals such as rabbits (Schade et al., 2005). Therefore, egg yolk provides a more hygienic, cost-efficient, convenient and rich source of antibodies compared with the traditional method of obtaining antibodies from mammalian serum. In contrast to antibiotics, the use of IgY is environmentally-friendly and elicits no undesirable side effects, disease resistance or toxic residues (Coleman, 1999).",

Although chicken IgY is the functional equivalent of mammalian IgG, there are some profound differences in their structure. The general structure of the IgY molecule is the same as the IgG molecule with two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains but IgY has a molecular mass of 180 kDa which is larger than that of mammalian IgG (150 kDa) (Fig. 1\n). The molecular mass (67\u201370 kDa) of the H chain in IgY is larger than the H chain from mammals (50 kDa). The greater molecular mass of IgY is due to an increased number of heavy-chain constant domains and carbohydrate chains (Warr et al., 1995). IgG has 3 C regions (C\u03b31\u2013C\u03b33), while IgY has 4 C regions (C\u03c51\u2013C\u03c54) and the presence of one additional C region with its two corresponding carbohydrate chains logically results in a greater molecular mass of IgY compared with IgG.",

Dried IgY preparations were stored for five to ten years at 4 \u00b0C without significant loss of antibody activity and the preparations also retained activity for six months at room temperature and for one month at 37 \u00b0C (Larsson et al., 1993).

            "text": "\n(i)\nAgglutination. Tsubokura et al. (1997) suggested that the inhibition of bacterial growth or colonization observed as a result of treatment with IgY can be the result of bacterial agglutination, causing a reduction in CFU rather than actual direct effects on individual bacteria. Although agglutination may be one mediator of growth inhibition, it is unlikely to be the most important mediator because cross-linking of bacteria is precluded by the steric hindrance of the two Fab arms of IgY (Gallagher and Voss, 1974).(ii)\nAdherence-blockade. Several in vitro studies have suggested that inhibition of adhesion is the dominant mechanism by which specific IgY counteracts pathogen activity (Jin et al., 1998, Lee et al., 2002). Jin et al. (1998) showed that IgY functions to prevent the adherence of E. coli K88 to the intestinal mucus of piglets. Particular components exposed on the Gram-negative bacteria surface such as outer membrane protein, lipopolysaccharide, fimbriae (or pili), and flagella, which are crucial factors for bacterial colonization, may be recognized and bound by related polyclonal antibody such as IgY (Sim et al., 2000). This binding may block or impair the functions of growth-related bacterial components and lead to bacterial growth inhibition. It is also possible that specific IgY binding to bacteria could alter cellular signaling cascades that could result in decreased toxin production and release.(iii)\nOpsonization followed by phagocytosis. Nie et al. (2004) determined that IgY improved the phagocytosis of S. aureus by neutrophils. Similarly, Zhen et al. (2008b) showed that phagocytic activity of E. coli by either milk macrophages or by polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes increased significantly in the presence of IgY. These results suggest that IgY enhanced phagocytic activity. Structural alterations were observed on the surface of S. typhimurium (Lee et al., 2002) and E. coli O111 (Zhen et al., 2008b) by binding with specific IgY. These changes could be explained by the variation of the electron cloud and/or electric field on the bacterial surface (Lee et al., 2002), resulting in greater vulnerability of the bacterial cells to phagocytosis.(iv)\nToxin neutralization. S. aureus capsular is a major virulence factor involved in the onset of bovine mastitis. Wang et al. (2011) studied the effectiveness of IgY against encapsulated S. aureus. Their results showed that IgY could prevent S. aureus internalization by mammary epithelial cells suggesting toxin neutralization activity, rather than direct growth inhibition as the means through which IgY acts to control mastitis.\n",

An in vitro study conducted in our laboratory indicated that IgY could inhibit the growth of bacteria by altering the bacterial cell surface thereby reducing the ability of bacteria to adhere to mammary epithelial cells (Zhen et al., 2008b). In a further study, the efficacy of specific IgY to reduce clinical and experimental mastitis caused by S. aureus was demonstrated by improving milk quality through a decrease in somatic cell and bacterial counts in milk (Zhen et al., 2009). The cure rates resulting from the use of IgY for clinical and experimental mastitis were dramatically higher than for untreated animals (Table 4\n).

In an animal feeding study, 21-day old pigs were challenged with 5 ml of ETEC K88 at a dose of 1012\n CFU ml\u2212 1 per piglet. IgY was administered to piglets three times a day for two days.

Furthermore, the field study showed the suppression of the incidence and severity of diarrhea in 14\u201318-day-old weaned piglets fed specific IgY powder, which was much lower than in those fed a commercial diet containing an antibiotic.

These enterotoxins are crucial virulence factors and therefore effective programs for immunological protection against ETEC-mediated diarrhea should include antitoxic immunity (Cardenas and Clements, 1993). Because of their small size, enterotoxins STa and STb are poorly immunogenic, but they can attain immunogenicity when coupled chemically or genetically to an appropriate carrier (Clements, 1990, Dubreuil et al., 1996).",

In order to make the useful toxoids, polyvalent enterotoxin STa\u2013LTB\u2013STb DNA and protein vaccines endowing immunogenicity to both STa and STb were constructed (You et al., 2011). We immunized laying hens with DNA vaccines and obtained antitoxic antibodies from egg yolks and this was confirmed by indirect ELISA. The polyvalent DNA vaccine pCI\u2013STa\u2013LTB\u2013STb expressed the STa\u2013LTB\u2013STb fusion peptide in vitro in cultured Hela cells. These egg yolk antibodies were able to neutralize the biological activity of ST and LT (You, 2011).

BCV may be more severe than BRV as it replicates in the epithelium of both the small and large intestine whereas BRV infects only the small intestine. Ikemori et al. (1997) examined the efficacy of specific IgY antibodies and cow colostrum antibodies to BCV-induced diarrhea in calves. They found that control calves which received no antibodies developed severe diarrhea resulting in all calves dying within 6 days of BCV challenge whereas calves treated with milk containing egg yolk or colostrum had positive weight gains and none of these calves died (Table 6\n). This study was conducted with very few animals and a larger study should be conducted to confirm these findings. However, these results do indicate that orally administered egg yolk or colostral antibodies have the potential to passively protect calves against BCV infection and the effect of IgY was higher than that of colostrum alone indicating that the passive immunization strategy with IgY provided a more efficacious alternative to existing treatments for BCV. The passive protective effects of using anti-ETEC IgY administration on fatal enteric colibacillosis in neonatal calves have also been studied (Ikemori et al., 1992). Calves fed milk containing IgY had only transient diarrhea, 100% survival and exhibited good body weight gains during the course of the study. In contrast, the controls which received no antibody had severe diarrhea and all died within 6 days of infection.",

However, our research work (Lu et al., 2008) represents the first report of the passive immunization of shrimp with IgY obtained from the egg yolk of chickens vaccinated with a DNA vaccine comprising genes encoding structural proteins of WSSV or with inactivated WSSV. Our work showed that IgY antibodies have a high affinity for WSSV and maintained good biological and neutralization activity especially when induced by the traditional inactivated vaccine. IgY antibody induced by the DNA vaccine was also able to neutralize disease in shrimp experimentally challenged with WSSV but was still inferior to inactivated WSSV (Lu et al., 2008). Using specific IgY from hens immunized with inactivated WSSV and DNA vaccine to neutralize WSSV, the challenged shrimp had 73.3 and 33.3% survival, respectively (Fig. 2\n). As well, the effectiveness of IgY provided by intramuscular injection, oral administration, and immersion was investigated in crayfish (Procambius clarkiaii) challenged with WSSV (Lu et al., 2009). Our results showed that immunization of specific IgY antibodies through intramuscular injection, oral administration or immersion were all effective means of protecting crayfish against WSSV. Unfortunately, these are labor intensive techniques and may have limited application under commercial aquaculture conditions where crayfish are raised in the ocean.",

Y. ruckeri is the aetiological agent of enteric red mouth disease, a systemic bacterial septicaemia, principally affecting farmed rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Stevenson et al., 1993). Y. ruckeri could persist for long periods in carrier fish and are shed in feces, representing a continuing source of infection. If a population of asymptomatic carrier fish could be adequately cleared by oral administration of anti-Y. ruckeri antibody, such treatment might be a cost-effective alternative approach to the slaughter of a stock of fish with a potential health risk. Rainbow trout fed with anti-Y. ruckeri IgY, 2 h before an immersion challenge with Y. ruckeri, showed a lower mortality rate after 8 days than did fish fed unsupplemented IgY feed before the challenge (Lee et al., 2000). The fish fed IgY also appeared to have fewer infections after 8 days, based on organ and intestinal cultures. In a subsequent trial, the IgY-fed fish had lower mortality than fish receiving unsupplemented IgY feed (Lee et al., 2000). The percentage of IgY-fed fish carrying Y. ruckeri in their intestinal samples appeared to be lower than in the untreated controls, regardless of whether the IgY containing feed was given before or after the challenge. The oral administration of specific IgY against fish pathogens could provide an alternative method to antibiotics and chemotherapy for prevention of bacterial diseases of fish in fish farm.",

Anti-E. tarda IgY were simultaneously administered orally to Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) with the pathogenic bacteria (105\u2013106\n CFU per fish). The non-treated infected eels died within 15 days whereas the eels receiving IgY survived and no disease symptoms were observed, suggesting that anti-E. tarda IgY is effective in preventing edwardsiellosis (Gutierrez et al., 1993).

It was also shown that IgY antibodies were not able to displace E. coli K88+ MB once bound to the mucosal receptor. This indicates that the antibodies have a lower affinity for the receptor than that of K88+ fimbriae. Since IgY could not remove previously bound E. coli K88+ MB from the mucus, a prophylactic use for IgY is suggested (Jin et al., 1998).

To date, IgY technology has been used for the treatment of livestock diseases such as mastitis and diarrhea, poultry diseases such as Salmonella, Campylobacteriosis, infectious bursal disease and Newcastle disease, as well as aquatic diseases like shrimp white spot syndrome virus, Y. ruckeri and E. tarda. Some advantages of IgY in the control of animal diseases are:1.They are highly effective.2.They are cost effective.3.Collection of eggs is non-invasive.4.The treatment is safe and live organisms are not used.5.The procedure is environmentally friendly.6.No toxic residues are produced and there is no development of resistance.7.The treatment can be used to control many different types of pathogens.\n",
