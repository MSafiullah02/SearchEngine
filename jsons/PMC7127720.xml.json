            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a devastating disease of swine that was initially recognized in the United Kingdom in 1971 and that has then spread to swine-producing European countries (Oldham, 1972, Pensaert et al., 1981). Since the 1990s, the disease has become rare in Europe and is more often associated with postweaning diarrhea in adult pigs (Saif et al., 2012). PED epidemics were first reported in Asia in 1982 and since then, PED has continued to threaten swine health causing substantial financial losses in the Asian swine industry (Chen et al., 2008, Kweon et al., 1993, Li et al., 2012, Puranaveja et al., 2009, Takahashi et al., 1983). In 2013, PED outbreaks suddenly appeared in the United States and have swept the national pork industry with high mortality in newborn piglets, posing significant economic and public health concerns (Mole, 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013). In 1978, the etiological agent of this disease was identified as a coronavirus, PED virus (PEDV), which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978, Saif et al., 2012). PEDV is a large, enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978, Saif et al., 2012). The PEDV genome is composed of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least 7 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 6), and a 3\u2032 UTR (Kocherhans et al., 2001). The two large ORF1a and 1b cover the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome and encode the non-structural replicase genes. The remaining ORFs in the 3\u2032 terminal region code for four major structural proteins, the 150\u2013220 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 20\u201330 kDa membrane (M) protein, 7 kDa envelop (E) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein (Duarte et al., 1994, Saif et al., 2012).",

            "text": "PEDV is a pathogenic enterocyte-tropic coronavirus of swine, and its infection is marked by acute enteritis with mortality approaching 100% in suckling piglets up to one week of age (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980, Saif et al., 2012). The virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and the virus replicates in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine. PEDV infection results in severe villous atrophy, leading to a reduction in the villous height:crypt depth ratio from the normal 7:1 to 3:1. This interrupts digestion and absorption of nutrients and electrolytes, thereby causing malabsorptive watery diarrhea followed by serious and fatal dehydration in piglets (Saif et al., 2012). In addition, PEDV can be propagated in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells in vitro, where the cytopathic effects (CPEs) consist of vacuolation and formation of syncytia with up to 100 nuclei (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). However, the mechanisms inducing cell death in PEDV-infected target cells, both in vitro and in vivo, remain poorly understood.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is a tightly regulated mechanism of cell death that is triggered by various extracellular (extrinsic) or intracellular (intrinsic) stimuli and modulated by anti- and pro-apoptotic cellular factors (Galluzzi et al., 2012). Cells undergoing apoptosis are accompanied by characteristic morphological changes, including rounding-up of the cell, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and plasma membrane blebbing (Kroemer et al., 2009). Apoptosis is considered to be a host innate defense mechanism that disrupts viral replication by eliminating virus-infected cells. Therefore, viruses have developed strategies to avoid apoptosis, which, in turn, prevent premature cell death and thus maximize progeny viral production (Thomson, 2001). However, many viruses have the ability to actively induce apoptosis as a response to viral replication, thereby facilitating the release and dissemination of viral progeny to neighboring cells. This pro-apoptotic event is one of the cytolytic properties of viral infections causing CPE in vitro or/and plays a pathogenic role contributing to cell damage, tissue injury, and disease severity in vivo (Clarke et al., 2009, Clarke and Tyler, 2009, DeDiego et al., 2011, Eleouet et al., 1998, Favreau et al., 2012, Lan et al., 2013, Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007, St-Louis and Archambault, 2007, Sarmento et al., 2006, Suzuki et al., 2008). At present, it is unknown whether PEDV triggers apoptotic cell death, and if so, whether virus-induced apoptosis aids or worsens viral replication and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine if PEDV induces apoptosis following infection in vitro and in vivo and to define the specific pathways involved in apoptotic death of virus-infected cells. Apoptotic cell death occurred after in vitro and in vivo infections of PEDV, suggesting that PEDV-induced apoptosis may play an important role in cytotoxicity and pathogenesis. Treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor failed to suppress PEDV-induced apoptosis and PEDV infection. However, PEDV replication and virus-triggered apoptosis were significantly impaired by inhibitors of cyclophilin D (CypD) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). These data indicate that PEDV promotes AIF-mediated and caspase-independent apoptosis, which is essential for the replication of PEDV. Overall, our study will improve the understanding of the correlation between PEDV-induced apoptosis and its pathogenic mechanisms and show the potential of anti-apoptotic therapeutic strategies for combating PEDV infection.",

            "text": "To investigate whether apoptotic cell death was triggered by PEDV, virus-infected cells were first examined for the presence of DNA fragmentation, which is a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis. Vero cells were infected with PEDV, and CPE was monitored after infection. Light microscopy of the PEDV-infected Vero cells indicated that typical CPEs characterized by vacuolation and syncytia formation were visible starting at 24 hpi and became prominent by 48 hpi (\nFig. 1A, upper panels). To detect intracellular fragmented DNA, cellular DNA from mock- or virus-infected cells was harvested and subjected to a DNA laddering assay. Consistent with the CPE observation results, intracellular DNA fragmentation appeared at 24 hpi, and the DNA ladder pattern was apparent at 48 hpi (Fig. 1A, lower panel). This characteristic of apoptosis was further confirmed using a TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, compared to mock-infected cells, TUNEL-labeled cells were only observed within virus-infected cells. The process of PEDV-induced apoptosis was then assessed using Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Virus- or mock-infected cells were stained with Annexin V and PI and then examined using FACS flow cytometry to quantitatively determine the percentage of viable, apoptotic, and dead cells. PEDV infection produced a high level of apoptosis (Annexin V positive/PI negative) appearing at 6 hpi, and the percentage of early apoptotic cells increased with infection time, reaching a maximum of 87.4% at 48 hpi (Fig. 1C). In addition, we sought to determine whether PEDV induces apoptosis in the natural host. To accomplish this, a TUNEL assay was performed to detect and quantify apoptosis in small intestine sections prepared from piglets experimentally inoculated with PEDV. Immunofluorescence using N protein-specific MAb revealed that abundant viral antigens were primarily present in enterocytes over the entire villi in all areas of the small intestine at 3 dpi and increasingly dominant in the interior of the villi at 5 dpi; the majority of virus-infected cells were TUNEL-positive (\nFig. 2). In contrast, no TUNEL-positive enterocytes were observed in the tissue specimens prepared from a non-infected animal (Fig. S1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PEDV infection induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "Caspases, a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, play critical roles in the execution phase of apoptosis of the cell leading to morphological and nuclear changes (Clarke and Tyler, 2009). In order to elucidate the mechanism and the type of apoptotic cell death, we initially assessed whether the broad-spectrum pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, blocks PEDV-induced apoptosis. Based on the results of the MTT assay, none of the doses of Z-VAD-FMK tested in the present study resulted in any change in cell viability (data not shown). Vero cells were treated with Z-VAD-FMK at concentrations of 100 \u03bcM followed by viral infection. At the indicated time points post-infection, virus-infected and Z-VAD-FMK-treated cells were analyzed based on FACS quantification of Annexin V binding. Notably, treatment with Z-VAD-FMK was incapable of protecting cells from PEDV-induced apoptosis (\nFig. 3A). The percentage of early apoptotic cells in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK was almost similar to that in vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells (second panel) and PEDV-infected cells during the course of infection (compared to Fig. 1C). These results indicated that caspases are not associated with PEDV-triggered apoptosis. For further confirmation, we tried to determine the activity of caspase-3 upon PEDV infection by western blot analysis. Caspase-3 is the main executioner caspase activated by the both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways causing the morphological features of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3B, no detectable level of cleaved caspase-3 was observed in PEDV-infected cells up to 48 hpi (first panel), whereas the N protein was first detected at 6 hpi, and its production greatly increased thereafter, indicating PEDV replication (third panel). On prolonged exposure of the western blot, however, it was apparent that a small amount of activated caspase-3 appears only at 48 hpi (second panel), which seems to be a basal level normally present at late time of infection. We next investigated if the replication of PEDV is also affected by the same caspase inhibitor. Vero cells were pretreated with Z-VAD-FMK at concentrations of 10\u2013100 \u03bcM or with DMSO as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection. Z-VAD-FMK was present during the entire period of infection. Viral production was measured by monitoring CPE and confirmed by immunofluorescence at 48 hpi (Fig. 3C). Apparent CPE and N-specific staining were equally evident in cells treated with Z-VAD-FMK when compared to vehicle-treated control cells. Furthermore, PEDV replication, as quantified by the growth kinetics results, was not reduced by Z-VAD-FMK treatment, indicating that activation of caspases is irrelevant to PEDV replication (Fig. 3D). Altogether, our data reveal that caspase cascades are not activated by PEDV and their chemical inhibition diminished neither PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death nor viral replication, suggesting that caspase activation is dispensable for the process.",

            "text": "Since caspases appear to be non-essential factors in PEDV-triggered apoptosis, we investigated an alternative caspase-independent apoptotic pathway mediated mainly by AIF in relation to apoptotic cell death induced by PEDV. AIF is a flavoprotein embedded in the outer surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Following apoptotic stimuli, AIF is proteolytically cleaved and truncated AIF is released from the mitochondria and translocates to the nucleus, where it causes high-molecular weight DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation independently of caspases (Cregan et al., 2002, Daugas et al., 2000, Galluzzi et al., 2012, Joza et al., 2001, Lu et al., 2013, Yuste et al., 2005). Mitochondria plays a central role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by releasing proapoptotic factors, such as AIF and cytochrome c (CytC), through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which is permeabilized in response to intracellular stress (Galluzzi et al., 2012). In order to study the potential role of mitochondrial AIF in the caspase-independent pathway of PEDV-induced apoptosis, thus, we first aimed to determine the subcellular localization of AIF in PEDV-infected cells using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Although AIF continued to localize broadly in the mitochondria after PEDV infection shown by its colocalization with a mitochondrial-specific marker, the majority of cells infected with PEDV also displayed a condensed AIF staining pattern within the nucleus, and its intensity was significantly elevated at 48 hpi (\nFig. 4A, arrows). This observation was confirmed by western blot analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 4B, an uncleaved 62 kDa AIF was detected in both extracts during the course of infection, whereas a cleaved form of AIF was observed only in nuclear extracts of PEDV-infected cells. We then analyzed the translocation of another proapoptotic protein, CytC, which is released to the cytoplasm by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization to execute caspase proteolytic cascade-dependent intrinsic apoptosis. In contrast to AIF, however, CytC was sustainedly located in the mitochondria of PEDV-infected cells, as demonstrated by the colocalization of CytC with MitoTracker and the detection of CytC in mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 4C and D). This CytC retention in the mitochondria during PEDV infection was concurrent with the caspase-independent apoptotic cell death induced by PEDV as described above. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that PEDV infection specifically triggers mitochondrial-nuclear translocation of AIF but not the release of mitochondrial CytC.",

Cells were treated with CsA, a chemical inhibitor of CypD, to inhibit mPTP formation upon PEDV infection. The DNA laddering assay indicated that the presence of CsA in cells infected with PEDV completely abolished intracellular DNA fragmentation (\nFig. 5A, lane 4), while cells infected with PEDV alone or combined with Z-VAD-FMK clearly displayed a DNA laddering pattern (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3). Upon CsA treatment, PEDV-induced apoptosis was then quantitatively evaluated by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment with CsA notably decreased the percentage of early apoptotic cells induced by PEDV (second panel), ranging from 19.1% to 29.9% during the course of PEDV infection (compared to Fig. 3A).

PEDV replication was determined by monitoring virus-specific CPE and verified by immunofluorescence at 48 hpi (\nFig. 6A). In contrast to vehicle-treated control cells, CsA had a strong inhibitory effect on PEDV propagation by dramatically decreasing virus-induced CPE and viral gene expression even at the lowest concentration used. The number of cells expressing viral antigen, as quantified by N protein staining results, was also reduced during CsA treatment, resulting in almost complete inhibition in response to 10 \u03bcM (Fig. 6B). To further assess the antiviral activity of CsA against PEDV replication, viral yield was determined during treatment with CsA. Upon infection, viral supernatants were collected at 48 hpi, and viral titers were measured. As Fig. 6C shows, the presence of CsA significantly reduced the release of viral progeny in a dose-dependent manner. The peak viral titer was determined to be 106.68\n PFU/ml in the vehicle-treated control, whereas the addition of 10 \u03bcM CsA declined the titer of PEDV to 101.69\n PFU/ml (an almost 5-log reduction compared to the control). The growth kinetics study further demonstrated that the overall process of PEDV replication was significantly delayed when cells were treated with CsA (Fig. 6D). In addition, we investigated whether viral protein translation and viral RNA synthesis were affected by CsA. The expression level of the PEDV N protein in the presence or absence of CsA was evaluated at 48 hpi by western blot analysis. Densitometric analysis of the western blot revealed that intracellular expression of the viral protein was entirely prevented by CsA at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM (\nFig. 7A). Similarly, levels of both genomic RNA and sg mRNA were greatly diminished in a dose-dependent manner and their synthesis was fully abolished at the highest CsA concentration (Fig. 7B). Taken together, our data strongly indicate that CsA proficiently suppresses the replication of PEDV, which is correlated with inhibition of PEDV-induced apoptosis by CsA.",

Because CypD is involved in alteration of mitochondrial membrane permeability, followed by release of proapoptotic factors, it is conceivable that inhibition of CypD would block AIF nuclear translocation induced by PEDV, leading to impaired PEDV-induced apoptosis and viral replication. We therefore determined whether CsA specifically affects the nuclear translocation of AIF mediated by PEDV infection. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy results demonstrated that AIF nuclear translocation in PEDV-infected cells was distinctly hampered following CypD inhibition by CsA, exhibiting a cytoplasmic distribution that colocalized with the mitochondrial marker during the entire course of PEDV infection (\nFig. 8A). Mitochondrial retention of AIF in the presence of CsA was confirmed by a cell fractionation assay. As expected, the level of truncated AIF in the nuclear fractions was barely detectable in the presence of CsA, demonstrating that inhibition of CypD failed to cause the relocalization of AIF from the mitochondria to the nucleus (Fig. 8B). Altogether, these results suggest that upon PEDV infection, CypD-dependent mPTP directly modulates apoptotic cell death by relocating AIF to the nucleus, resulting in successful viral replication.",

To accomplish this, we first used an AIF inhibitor, N-PhMI, that prevents AIF-induced DNA fragmentation (Susin et al., 1996, Wang et al., 2007). Treatment with N-PhMI resulted in substantial reduction of the percentage of apoptotic cells during PEDV infection (\nFig. 9). Addition of N-PhMI retained an average cell viability of over 80% during the entire time of PEDV infection, demonstrating that inhibition of AIF robustly represses apoptosis induced by PEDV. To further confirm the importance of AIF in apoptosis triggered by PEDV infection, we examined whether this drug alters the nuclear relocalization of AIF following PEDV infection by confocal microscopy analysis. As depicted in\nFig. 10A, N-PhMI treatment completely abrogated AIF nuclear translocation induced by PEDV, leading to mitochondrial accumulation of AIF. Western blot analysis provided further support by showing the absence of truncated AIF in the nuclear fractions of PEDV-infected cells in the presence of N-PhMI (Fig. 10B). These results strongly indicated that nuclear targeting of AIF is required for PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death.",

At 48 hpi, the level of PEDV replication was measured indirectly, as viral antigen production, by quantifying cells expressing the N protein through IFA (\nFig. 11A). Treatment of cells with 5 \u03bcM N-PhMI resulted in a >90% decrease in PEDV production compared to the untreated vehicle control. To further examine the inhibitory effect of N-PhMI on PEDV infection, virus production was measured using viral supernatants propagated for 48 h under each condition. As shown in Fig. 11B, inhibition of AIF by N-PhMI markedly decreased the titer of PEDV in a dose-dependent manner, and the lowest viral titer was determined to be 102.61\n PFU/ml at the concentration of 5 \u03bcM (an almost 4-log reduction compared to the control). Furthermore, the replication process of PEDV severely interfered with the presence of N-PhMI (Fig. 11C). Taken together, our data show that AIF is an essential host determinant in a caspase-independent apoptosis process activated by PEDV, which is indispensable for PEDV replication.",

Viruses possess various mechanisms to inhibit apoptosis that allow them to evade the innate immune defenses, which restrict viral infection by eliminating infected cells through the interactions at different stages of the apoptotic pathway. However, some viruses induce apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of viral progeny for further invasion, which are important biological parts in viral pathogenesis and disease processes that promote cell death and tissue injury. Although various viruses are known to modulate apoptosis as a critical armament to complete their replication cycle, it remains so far even undetermined whether PEDV induces apoptosis. In the present study, we characterized PEDV-induced cytotoxicity and demonstrated that apoptotic cell death is triggered in PEDV-infected cells in vitro, displaying biochemical features of apoptosis including oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and PS exposure. This finding strongly suggests that the cytopathology of PEDV infection, represented by vacuolation and syncytia formation in vitro, is associated with the apoptotic process. The capability of PEDV to induce apoptosis was also verified by an in vivo study using the small intestinal tissues of piglets experimentally inoculated with virulent PEDV. The results showed that the great part of the villus enterocytes in all segments of the small intestine infected with PEDV experienced apoptotic cell death at 3 dpi, and thereafter, cells undergoing apoptosis were more evident inside the small intestine (Fig. 2). Since a specific hallmark of PEDV infection in neonatal piglets is the severe destruction of the villi in the small intestine causing lethal diarrhea and dehydration, PEDV-induced massive apoptosis in vivo appears to be one of the viral pathogenic mechanisms to destroy the target enterocytes leading to villus atrophy or vacuolation.",

Upstream initiator caspases are first activated by both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways and subsequently, are responsible for processing and activation of downstream corresponding effector caspases to mediate apoptosis (Clarke and Tyler, 2009, Galluzzi et al., 2012). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis caused by PEDV, we focused on the potential involvement of caspases in apoptotic cell death upon PEDV infection. In the present study, caspase-3, the primary effector caspase, was not proteolytically cleaved to trigger the execution phase of apoptosis during the course of PEDV infection, although its inactive precursor was continuously present in cells infected with PEDV. However, our western blot data, after long exposure, showed only slight levels of caspase-3 activation at 48 hpi (Fig. 3B, second panel). This observation ruled out the possibility that the absence of active caspase-3 was caused by problems with the antibody used or by technical issues. Likewise, chemical suppression of caspase activation was found to be absolutely incapable of abrogating PEDV-induced apoptosis and viral replication. These results strongly indicate that the failure of the pan-caspase inhibitor to protect cell survival is likely a consequence of caspase-independent cell death, which is indispensable for the replication of PEDV.",

Thus, we sought to investigate other pro-apoptotic factors that could be involved in PEDV-induced apoptosis, independent of caspases. In response to various intracellular stress conditions, both pro- and anti-apoptotic signals converge toward a mitochondrion-centered control mechanism to trigger intrinsic apoptosis. Under this circumstance, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) can begin directly at the outer mitochondrial membrane due to the pore-forming activity of the pro-apoptotic Bax subfamily that translocate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria or can result from the mitochondrial permeability transition at the inner mitochondria membrane caused by the opening of the mPTP (Brenner and Grimm, 2006, Galluzzi et al., 2012, Tait and Green, 2013). This phenomenon permits the release of several proteins normally retained within the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol (Galluzzi et al., 2012). Among these, cytosolic CytC participates with other pro-apoptotic factors in the formation of the apoptosome, which triggers the caspase-dependent proteolytic cascade (Galluzzi et al., 2012, Li et al., 1997), whereas AIF, a ubiquitously expressed flavoprotein, critically functions in caspase-independent apoptosis by relocating to the nucleus and promoting large-scale DNA fragmentation and cell death (Galluzzi et al., 2012, Joza et al., 2001, Susin et al., 1999). We demonstrate here that the translocation of mitochondrial AIF to the nucleus was actively manifested during PEDV infection. Conversely, displacement of CytC from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm was completely absent in PEDV-infected cells. This result further supports the hypothesis that PEDV triggers apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. The association of PEDV-induced apoptosis with AIF translocation to the cytosol, without the release of CytC followed by caspase activation, indicates that AIF is the sole pro-apoptotic factor released via altered mitochondrial membrane permeability and primarily acts directly to execute apoptotic cell death in PEDV infection.",

            "text": "The unique relocation of AIF, but not CytC, leads us to speculate that MOMP may be regulated by the opening process following mPTP formation during PEDV infection, in which CypD functions as a major inducing factor to constitute the mPTP complex in the mitochondrial membrane. The data clearly show that inhibition of CypD by CsA blocked apoptosis induced by PEDV and was accompanied by 70\u201380% cell survival after PEDV infection, comparable to mock-infected cells. Furthermore, CsA could exert the antiviral activity via potent inhibition of multiple steps of the PEDV life cycle, including viral translation, RNA synthesis, and spread of viral progeny. Notably, chemical suppression of CypD impaired AIF nuclear translocation, leading to absolute mitochondrial retention of AIF. Thus, CypD-mediated mPTP modulation plays a pivotal role in caspase-independent apoptotic cell death by controlling AIF translocation upon PEDV infection. Numerous putative cellular proteins are known to bind with CypD to promote mPTP formation. Bax is one such factor, which has been shown to be displaced toward the mitochondria and to interact subsequently with CypD to facilitate the formation of pores in the mitochondrial membrane in response to apoptotic stimuli, including viral infection (Favreau et al., 2012, Kumarswamy and Chandna, 2009). Although it is unclear whether Bax is directly involved in PEDV-induced apoptosis, this mechanism is less plausible because PEDV infection was irrelevant to mitochondrial CytC release, which is mainly mediated by mitochondrial translocation of Bax. Similarly, direct inhibition of AIF with a chemical inhibitor completely confined AIF protein in the mitochondria without nuclear localization, and robustly diminished PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death and PEDV replication. The inhibitory activity of N-PhMI on PEDV infection was less efficient than that of CsA, although treatment with N-PhMI also exhibited significant suppression of PEDV replication in its own way. This difference can be attributed to the wide-spectrum antiviral effect of CsA via multiple simultaneous mechanisms; CsA is known to inhibit the replication of several RNA viruses, including nidoviruses, by affecting the function of various members of the cellular cyclophilin protein family (de de Wilde et al., 2013, Kambara et al., 2011, Nakagawa et al., 2004, Pfefferle et al., 2011, Qing et al., 2009;). Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that CsA fully blocks arterivirus replication by suppressing viral RNA synthesis (Wilde et al., 2013). We also showed here that treatment of cells with CsA dramatically reduces synthesis of both genomic RNA and sg mRNA (Fig. 7B). Therefore, CsA appears to synergistically elicit its antiviral activity on the replication of PEDV through inhibition of apoptotic cell death and interference with viral RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "In summary, our findings described here reveal that PEDV induces apoptotic cell death, which represents a cytolytic mechanism causing CPEs in vitro and contributes to PEDV pathogenicity by damaging the villous enterocytes of the small intestine, leading to malabsorptive diarrhea. However, PEDV-induced apoptosis was neither inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK nor accompanied by the activation of caspase cascades and the concomitant release of CytC from the mitochondria, strongly indicating that this cell death event by PEDV is caspase-dispensable. On the other hand, we demonstrated the essential roles of CypD and AIF in PEDV-induced apoptosis; in response to PEDV infection, MOMP occurs through opening of the mPTP dependent on CypD, which collapses the mitochondrial potential, resulting in the characteristic release of AIF to the nucleus and thereby mediating large-scale DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, inhibition of either CypD or AIF robustly abrogated the life cycle of PEDV at subcytotoxic doses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CypD-involved, AIF-indispensable apoptosis, independent of both caspase activation and CytC release following viral infection. Although mitochondrial CypD and AIF necessarily contribute to PEDV-induced apoptosis, the upstream intracellular regulatory signal(s) and the viral protein(s) that are associated with this mitochondrion-centered apoptotic pathway mediated by PEDV infection are still unclear and accordingly, identification of such cellular and viral factors would be the next issue to be addressed in future studies. In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that PEDV induces apoptotic cell death via a caspase-independent, AIF-mediated pathway that plays a critical role in PEDV replication and pathogenesis and suggest that the anti-apoptotic approach may be one of appropriate strategies for the development of an anti-PEDV compound to combat PED.",

Vero cells were treated with CsA at the indicated concentrations for 1 h prior to infection and were then infected with PEDV (MOI of 0.1). PEDV-infected cells were further maintained for 48 h in the presence of vehicle or CsA. PEDV-specific CPEs were observed daily and were photographed at 48 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 200\u00d7(first panels). For immunostaining, infected cells were fixed at 48 hpi and stained with anti-PEDV N antibody followed by Alexa green-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (second panels). The cells were then counterstained with DAPI (third panels) and examined using a fluorescent microscope at 200\u00d7magnification. Viral production in the presence of CsA was measured by quantifying the number of cells expressing N proteins through IFA. Five fields at 200\u00d7magnification were counted per each condition, and the total number of cells per field as determined by DAPI staining was similar in all fields. Values are representative of the mean of three independent experiments and error bars represent standard deviations. (C) Release of viral progeny in the presence of CsA. Vero cells were pretreated with DMSO or CsA for 1 h and were mock- or PEDV-infected (MOI of 0.1). At 48 hpi, the virus supernatants were collected and viral titers were determined.

(A) At 48 hpi, cellular lysates were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using an antibody against the PEDV N protein. The blot was also reacted with anti-\u03b2-actin antibody to verify equal protein loading. PEDV N protein expression was quantitatively analyzed by densitometry in terms of the relative density value to the \u03b2-actin gene, and CsA-treated sample results were compared to DMSO-control results. (B) Total cellular RNA was extracted at 48 hpi, and strand-specific viral genomic RNAs (black bars) and sg mRNAs (white bars) of PEDV were amplified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Viral positive-sense genomic RNA and sg mRNA levels were normalized to monkey GAPDH mRNA, and relative quantities (RQ) of mRNA accumulation were evaluated.
