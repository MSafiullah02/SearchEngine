Unfortunately, differentiating the effects of global warming and climate change on the rest of the factors that affect the world agricultural and livestock production is not easy, but studies have shown that increases in corn and wheat production since 1980 would be a 5% higher in the absence of the effects of climate change.

The increased requirements have been ascribed to reduce water availability in the growing seasons, evapotranspiration and changes in crop phenology (Woznicki et al., 2015; Sloat et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020) . This causes great uncertainty about the predictions in the literature (Chung and Nkomozepi, 2012). 9 lower magnitudes than non-irrigated conditions, with increase in precipitation. Irrigated land exhibited considerably increased robustness, and even more effective mitigation of the climate impacts. By combining information on climate changes with soil-and crop-specific evapotranspiration models, they predicted the potential amounts of irrigation water needed to prevent crop failures up to the year 2070. In a scenario of increasing temperatures, the amount of groundwater available for agricultural practices in the future will be inadequate. Hence the importance of computational methods with a view to estimating irrigation requirements under the changing climate conditions.",

However, we must bear in mind that the status of resources, monitored by FAO, continues to decline. Although fisheries substantially contribute to the global demand for food (especially in poor countries, with greater food insecurity), the lack of data on the status of many fisheries in inland waters leads to a more delicate situation.

Other new drying and storage technologies make implementation of the dry chain feasible to minimize mycotoxin accumulation and insect infestations in dry products, reduce food loss, improve food quality, safety and security, and protect public health.",

Even if this goal is fulfilled, many climate impacts such as sea level rise are likely to remain for centuries (IPCC, 2014b) . Imagine a scenario in 2050 where societies have transitioned away from coal and natural gas to wind, solar and other renewable sources of energy. In this scenario, public policy and infrastructure investments will have turned walking, cycling and public transit the most accessible and popular forms of transportation and air travel will be used only as a last resort. In this otherwise best-case scenario, if global trends in meat and dairy intake continue, our likelihood of staying below the 2\u00ba C threshold will still be extremely low (Kim et al., 2015) . This is why urgent, dramatic reductions in meat and dairy consumption, together with substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, transportation, and other sources, are crucial to avoid catastrophic climate changes. The responsibility for eating lower on the food chain falls most heavily on countries such as the US, which is the greatest per capita consumer of meat and dairy. Changing diets on an international scale will require more than simply re-educating consumers; in fact, national policies will have to provide increasing support for plant-centric diets (Kim et al., 2015) . Strategies for improving resilience to climate change and extreme conditions should be anticipated in all production management areas ( Table 2) .

They suggest that using the water footprint to assess the suitability of irrigation in order to implement water resources management policies, irrigation and the most effective crop variety worldwide. This would be the best way to achieve a viable adaptation of crops to environmental changes.The advent of powerful computational resources has facilitated the monitoring and implementation of more effective solutions for the increased irrigation demand. The effects of irrigation on the water table and on soil salinity, drainage and groundwater, and those of mitigation strategies, can currently be simulated and predicted by using agro-hydro-salinity models such as SaltMod (SaltMod, 2001). Such models have allowed the effects of climatic conditions on agriculture to be predicted before they occur (Elliott et al., 2014; Ashour & Al-Najar, 2012). For example, Sun et al. (2019) identified, for areas of northern China, the best practices of water management and fertilization with N for summer cucumber in the greenhouse. They calibrated and validated models constructed from experimental data (applied to 240 scenarios with different water uses and various fertilization conditions) using environmental and economic indices to determine the best management practices. Mahmoud & Gan (2019) used remote sensing and a geographical information system (GIS) to conduct a spatial and temporal study over the 1950-2013 period in Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, they collected information about evapotranspiration and modelled crop coefficients as a function of a 16-day time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index. They used the information thus obtained to simulate daily evapotranspiration with the model of soil water balance and aggregated it to the monthly and annual evapotranspiration figures. Riediger et al. (2014) examined the need for re-adaptation of agricultural irrigation in sandy soils from \u00dclzen County (Central Europe) by using computational modelling methods.",

            "text": "A deeper understanding of the effects on crops by the changing climate can only be achieved by filling some knowledge gaps in knowledge worldwide. Combining indigenous, local knowledge with technological advances may be an effective way of dealing with climate change and its impacts(Painemilla et al., 2010, Cadilhac   et al., 2017 Morss et al., 2011). In fact, promoting the use of indigenous knowledge to addressclimate-related issues [International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), 2012] and their incorporation into short-and long-term plans for adaptation to the expected changes appears to be a wise strategy towards reducing uncertainties (Kangalawe et al., 2011; Cadilhac et al., 2017; Morss et al., 2011). The above-described strategies can be supplemented with others based on innovation in planting and harvesting genomics. Some American and European countries have already diversified livelihoods, harvested rainwater or used alternative livelihoods for fishing by developing change-resistant hybrids, as a mean to face climate change, especially among farmers in diverse tropical and subtropical areas all over the world (Curcic et al., 2018). This should generate new opportunities but also lead to limitations arising from various factors of not only environmental and technological character, but also of political and market factors (Schroth and Ruf, 2014; Debaeke et al., 2017). Diversification strategies can be defined on different bases including: -Using more profitable crops to raise income, -Spreading income from traditional crops to shorten times between harvests, -Increasing food security, -Reducing vulnerability and unwanted effects on markets, policies and the environment. Because weather and climate changes are already here, successfully addressing them will require deriving useful insight from them by converting facts into opportunities. Some examples include the combination of local knowledge with novel innovative genomic tools and diversification; using heterogeneous site characteristics remaining as the legacy of previous forest vegetation to create new market opportunities for growing urban centers; developing effective government policies; impose restrictions to favor specific crops or facilitate access to improved vegetables or more efficient farming systems. While diversification can respond to the problem of structural environmental degradation associated with the abuse of crop monocultures, decisions ultimately depend on farmers' conditions, such as age, educational level, economic and financial situation, as well as the dimensions of the farm and the family. Decisions can be supported by comprehensive long-term studies conducted by interdisciplinary professionals.(Schroth & Ruf, 2014).",

            "text": "quote before, long-term measures to be taken to minimize the impact of climate change include enriching soils with organic matter. This can be accomplished by using the global reserves of organic matter in soil and transition crops to facilitate its enrichment(Kaye et al., 2017).Most of the previous examples derive from analyses and predictions for North America.In Europe, diverse studies examined the effect of global warming and climate change upon soil functions.Hamidov et al. (2018) reviewed twenty such studies and established a link to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There most revealing findings were as follows: (a) adaptation options reflect local conditions; (b) reduced soil erosion threats and increased soil organic carbon are to be expected, but soil compaction may increase in some areas; (c) most adaptation options are anticipated to improve soil functions; and (d) the fact that soil functions are interrelated requires improving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture by properly addressing climate change(Hamidov et al., 2018).6. More pestsCrop pests (insects or fungi) can survive or even reproduce with greater incidence each year as average temperatures increase in winter. Pests from lower latitudes can migrate to higher latitudes, and new pests invade other regions, as temperature and humidity conditions change.These modifications would not only be reflected on the growth of crops but also on their altitude(Battisti et al., 2015; Bhatnagar et al., 2018;Bale et al., 2010;Gu et al., 2018; Castex et al.,   change to global warming, the risks posed by pests and diseases on plants and animals, and their potential effects on human health and food security. Its members assessed the consequences of climate change on fish diseases and the behavior of invasive aquatic species, as well as the corresponding re-diffusions on aquaculture and fishing(FAO, 2008). The most salient conclusion was the presence of special risks as regards the impact of diseases and pests directly driven by climate change. This led to urge the adoption of preventive measures and the facilitation of adaptation to the challenge, as well as surveillance and control measures, together with climate-smart pest management(Heeb et al., 2019). In fact, climate change is known to be altering in a gradual but inexorable way pest distribution. Temperature and humidity changes can alter the geographical distribution of plants, fungi and insects, and hence the interaction between pests and crops. In addition, global changes in vegetation by effect of deforestation and desertification can increase vulnerability to pests and diseases. Worth special note in this respect is a growing change in geographical distribution in some arthropods (mosquitoes, flies, ticks and fleas, mainly) by effect of the changing temperatures and humidity(Sultana, 2017; ;Asplen et al., 2015). These arthropods are vectors of viruses and bacteria with implications on the health of crops and humans. As a result, new individuals without natural immunity (plants, animals and humans included) may be affected, and a public health problem or a dramatic loss of food production efficiency may arise.Climate changes have also led a number of species to expand northwards in North America, Asia and Europe(F\u00e4lt-Nardmann et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2011). This problem can have a considerable impact on aquaculture and fishing. Therefore, global warming can alter phytoplankton, zooplankton, algae and microalgae, and cause drastic changes in the geographical distribution of species. This change in geographic distribution would cause native species of certain latitudes to become invasive species by migrating to areas that are more favorable from a climatic point of view(Soto, 2008;Yanik & Aslan, 2018). The problem is worsened by the need to fight the pests with increasing amounts of xenobiotics, thus increasing the amounts of pesticide residues and veterinary drugs that penetrate the food chain to unacceptable levels(Arias-Estevez et al., 2008).",

            "text": "introducing pest-and diseases-resistant crops and livestock varieties. Although grain legumes possess various sources of insect resistance, widespread adoption of large-scale measures on insect-resistant crops has so far been constrained by limited efforts in the production and distribution of resistant seeds(Sharma et al., 2010). Grain legume pests can be managed efficiently through cultural manipulation and their environment through intercropping, population monitoring, modification of agricultural systems in order to significantly increase the activity of the natural enemies of a certain cultivation, the use of natural essential oils and biopesticides, either alone or in combination with traditional pesticides, cultivation of resistant varieties of insects obtained by conventional genetic reproduction or genetic engineering, and implementation of applications adapted to the specific needs of synthetic pesticides. However, the relative efficiency of some pest management strategies (particularly those based on biopesticides or natural plant products) may be considerably reduced by a hot climate. In addition, genotypes can be expected to interact more strongly with the medium to express resistance to pests, and this would require greater efforts in identifying sources of resistance. This would allow the development of integrated pest management packages that can be used successfully under the conditions predicted for the future.",

Reeves et al. (2018), however, have recently questioned the program, in such a prestigious journal as Science. These authors suspect that the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) may somehow have funded the project to breach existing international treaties against the proliferation of biological weapons established in the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).7. Risks to fisheriesAquaculture and extractive fishing contribute substantially to food security and the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. The combined global production of both sectors was quantified at 171 billion kilograms in 2016, with 53% and 47% from extractive fishing and aquaculture respectively(FAO, 2018a). A value of \u20ac 323 billion has been estimated, 207 billion of them coming from aquaculture (FAO, 2018a). Growth in aquaculture production was largely responsible for the average annual increase in world fish consumption from 1961 to 2016: 3.2%, which was twice the growth rate of the human population (1.6%). Fish consumption per capita increased globally from 9.0 kg in 1961 to 20.2 kg in 2015. This economic activity, combining both sectors, directly or indirectly employs some 200 million people(Movilla Pateiro et al., 2020).",

The adaptation and mitigation strategies are based on the peculiar characteristics and interactions of fisheries and aquaculture within the framework of feasible policy instruments. Strategies and policy measures need to be evolved to combat the observable and projected impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture in order to protect the livelihoods of the fishing communities and food security. The response will depend mainly on the characteristics of the fisheries and the adaptive capability of the communities. However, each country needs adaptive and mitigation strategies that will improve the management of the fisheries and aquaculture, protect the integrity of the aquatic ecosystems, respond to the opportunities and threats on livelihoods and food security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions(FAO, 2018a,b).",

They also include rapid pathogen and contaminant detectors relying on novel techniques (nanotechnologies included); new molecular biological methods such as nucleic acid sequence comparisons and genomics-based approaches to characterizing complex microbial communities and their interactions; and the use of genetically modified crops suitable for growth on marginalized land. Although countries will differ in their capacity to participate in the development of the new scientific and technological advances, all should strive to be up to date with new developments so that they can efficiently exploit the new opportunities and, possibly, influence the prioritization of research investments. Special attention should be given by each individual country to the development of capacities and mechanisms for assessing and managing environmental and food safety risks potentially associated to the use of the new technologies.
