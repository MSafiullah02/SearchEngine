These disturbances might depend on a direct effect of the SARS-CoV-2, but also on well-known precipitating factors such as prolonged hospitalization, pain, constipation, urinary retention and a broad range of metabolic abnormalities that occur during the course of a severe infection. Delirium has previously been estimated to occur in up to 50% of hospitalized elderly patients and 80% of critically ill patients who receive mechanical ventilation [2] , so reported rates are likely to rise by the end of this ongoing pandemic.",
