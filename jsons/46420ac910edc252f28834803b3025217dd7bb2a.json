However, although most studies of virus ecology and evolution have implicitly assumed a \"onehost, one-virus\" model of host-pathogen interactions, such as the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)-IAV model (van Dijk et al., 2014) , both hosts and their viruses exist in communities, and it is likely that these communities are the drivers of viral ecology. For example, despite intensive focus on the Mallard-IAV system (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; van Dijk et al., 2014) , IAV is in reality a multi host virus detected in over 100 species of wild birds, with different avian species playing different roles in virus ecology and evolution (Olsen et al., 2006) . For example, gulls are reservoirs for evolutionary distinct IAV subtypes (Wille et al., 2011) , and rare subtypes may be maintained in members of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes that are infrequently sampled . In turn, numerous viruses have been detected in wild bird populations, and Mallards may be coinfected with at least three different RNA viruses simultaneously in the absence of overt signs of disease (Wille et al., 2015 (Wille et al., , 2017 . These other avian RNA viruses-avian coronavirus and avian avulavirus type 1-have seasonal prevalence patterns that generally mirror that of IAV, and it is therefore possible that they may also share similar host taxonomic or geographic differences in viral community structure (Wille et al., 2017) . Virus co-infection may also be an important driver of viral prevalence, as virus-virus interactions may enhance or interfere with infection (Diaz-Munoz, 2017; Elena & Sanjuan, 2005; Henle, 1950; Jolly & Narayan, 1989) . As a case in point, a higher prevalence of avian coronavirus was found in a bird population experiencing IAV infection, suggesting that the latter might play a role in structuring avian viromes in general (Wille et al., 2015) .",

We used a recently developed unbiased metatranscriptomic pipeline based on bulk RNA-sequencing (Shi, Zhang, & Holmes, 2018) to reveal the viromes of four Australian avian species and to evaluate how the structure of entire viral communities is impacted by a variety of ecological correlates. In particular, we assessed the role of host taxonomy, location and co-infection with IAV on virome structure. This study illustrates the extent of RNA viral diversity in wild birds, and the importance of the expansion of traditional host-pathogen systems beyond simple one-host, one-virus systems to disentangle ecological processes in viral presence and abundance.

A large viral diversity in healthy, individual wild birds (Fawaz et al., 2016; Wille et al., 2015) and poultry (Day, Oakley, Seal, & Zsak, 2015; Day et al., 2010; Lima et al., 2017) has been previously described, in contrast to chickens in which viral diversity was described in diseased animals (e.g., diarrhoea; Boros et al., 2016) . The leading hypothesis reflects a long history of host-pathogen co-evolution: chickens are a relatively new host niche for IAV, and following spillover from wild birds highly pathogenic phenotypes evolve (e.g., H7; Seekings et al., 2018) , sometimes resulting in catastrophic mortality. This is in contrast to wild birds that have likely been co-evolving with IAV over long time periods, with natural selection perhaps favouring lower virulence; as a consequence, the highly pathogenic IAV found in wild birds is most likely due to spillover from poultry (Barber, Aldridge, Webster, & Magor, 2008; Little, Shuker, Colegrave, Day, & Graham, 2010; van Dijk, Fouchier, Klaassen, & Matson, 2015) . Indeed, a muted inflammatory response translating to immunological tolerance to viral infections may allow some hosts, such as bats, to harbour a variety of viruses (Brook & Dobson, 2015; Xie et al., 2018) . Similarly, Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and wild strain Mallard ducks appear to have a controlled innate immune response against both low pathogenic IAV (Helin et al., 2018) and highly pathogenic IAV (Saito et al., 2018) , with upregulation of the innate immune system occurring on day 1 postinfection and no evidence of hypercytokinaemia, or \"cytokine storms.\"",

To date, much of what we know about viruses in wild birds is derived from many years of research in IAV Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; Munster et al., 2007; Olsen et al., 2006) and those RNA viruses that have similar patterns of host preference and seasonality (Wille et al., 2015 (Wille et al., , 2017 were not successfully isolated, demonstrating the power of the meta-transcriptomic approach used here. These trends, however, may be biased due to sample pooling, such that the patterns may be due to only a few individuals in the pool. Ultimately, therefore, the validity of the patterns observed here needs to be re-assessed on the basis of individual transcriptomes, although such work will obviously be both costly and time-consuming. In addition, it was previously shown (Wille et al., 2015) that co-infection with IAV was important in modulating the prevalence of other RNA viruses. In particular, IAV modulates the interferon response of the host, changing the antiviral state (Garcia-Sastre, 2001 , 2011 Hale, Randall, Ortin, & Jackson, 2008) , and this may promote co- In sum, we have expanded our understanding of the diversity of avian viruses and laid the foundation for future hypothesis testing of the factors associated with virome structure in wild birds using highthroughput meta-transcriptomics. This study focused on avian orders known to be central in the ecology of IAV, but also a number of other RNA viruses. Although this study is of a relatively limited scale from an ecological perspective, we have successfully described viral diversity in samples collected from different sites, times and avian species and found evidence for differences across these factors.",

In addition to H12N5 and H9N3 in Anas ducks, one short contig from the HA of H10 influenza virus was also identified. These three subtypes, all identified in Anas ducks, had different abundances in this library: H12N5 comprised 77% of all avian viral reads (0.081% of all reads in the library), Broadly, the IAVs from Australian birds described here were most similar to viruses sampled from Eurasian wild birds, which is expected given that Australian migratory birds use the East Asian-Australian flyway.

Members of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes have proven to be excellent model species for this study, and we detected viruses previously described in these hosts(Chu et al., 2011;Muradrasoli et al., 2010;Wille, Muradrasoli, Nilsson, & Jarhult, 2016;Wille et al., 2017) as well as a suite of novel viruses. One of the key observations of our study is that avian taxonomy did not drive virome structure; that is, there was no specific clustering of libraries in the NMDS plots by avian order (Anseriformes vs. Charadriiformes), and the three Anas duck libraries were different, although this analysis had limited statistical power. Given that IAV is prevalent in both these avian orders, we suggest that host ecology may play a more important role than host taxonomy in shaping virome diversity. For example, it is possible that waterbirds share viral families, genera and species as shallow water bodies facilitating virus transmission between individuals, as with IAV(Hoye, Fouchier, & Klaassen, 2012;van Dijk et al., 2018). In support of this, there was a difference between birds sampled (Red-necked Avocets in particular) in lakes of the arid interior as compared to temperate coastlines.The ecological factors assessed here are not mutually exclusive, as shown by the complex relationship between the three Anas duck libraries which had different structures given different conditions (location and IAV status). Samples from Ruddy Turnstones were collected from the same beaches on the same sampling trip, yet the 10 birds positive and negative for IAV had different viromes (total abundance, species abundances and viral diversity). Furthermore, the viromes of Anas ducks and Ruddy Turnstones that were positive for IAV were more similar to each other than to all other libraries. Anecdotally, while we were able to successfully culture H6N8 and H10N8 virus as part of an ongoing IAV surveillance project, the viruses from the Anas ducks",

We have a surprisingly poor understanding of virus-virus interactions, although viruses do have mechanisms to mediate infection by other viruses. For example, viruses may have synergistic (enhancing) or antagonistic (inhibiting) interactions, and this may occur within and/or across viral species(Diaz-Munoz, 2017;Elena & Sanjuan, 2005;Henle, 1950;Jolly & Narayan, 1989). Regardless, virus-virus interactions are important drivers of co-infection and may be further affected by virus and host ecology(Diaz-Munoz, 2017).",
