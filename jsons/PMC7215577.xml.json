COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Since 8 December 019, clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [2]. Mass transmission occurred in a matter of weeks in Wuhan, and people in the resulting chains of transmission spread the infection by traveling during the Chinese New Year holidays in early 2020. As a growing number of confirmed cases of infections was reported, the Chinese government took prompt response measures to combat the virus. On 9 January 2020, the causative agent of this pneumonia was initially confirmed as a novel coronavirus. On 20 January the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (NHFPC) classified COVID-19 as a category B infectious disease based on the Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases and took preventive and control measures for category A infectious diseases [3]. On 23 January Wuhan City was put under lockdown to contain the outbreak [4]. On February 2, Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, a 1000-bed makeshift hospital for treating infected patients, was built just in 10 days [5]. On 8 February China completed work on Leishenshan Hospital, another 1600-bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan [6]. As of 10 February the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China surpassed 42,000 [7]. In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, there was a fierce race between the growth of patients and the allocation of medical resources.",

In these circumstances, billions of people eagerly acquired information about COVID-19 through social media. Social media not only provides a platform for sharing personal lives but can also be used to examine public opinion and perceptions. This source of information may be comparable to the public comments collected by traditional approaches (e.g., questionnaires) [8]. Topics and sentiments related to COVID-19 spread rapidly, thus influencing public behavior during the epidemic. Combined with spatiotemporal information collected from social media, analyses of public opinion on COVID-19 are important for improving emergency responses, enhancing sentiment awareness, and supporting decision making [9].",

With the proliferation of web-based social and communication technologies, the wide use of social media has enabled broad public participation in emergency response [10,11]. A growing number of people use location-based social network services (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, or Sina-Weibo), with which they create time-stamped, geo-located data and share information about their immediate surroundings [12]. The rapid development of machine learning and text mining facilitates the analysis and understanding of human behavior, public responses, potential courses of action, and public opinions from social media data in emergency situations [13,14]. Gruebner et al. (2018) extracted the negative emotions of people in New York City before, during, and after superstorm Sandy from Twitter data using an advanced sentiment analysis method called \u201cExtracting the Meaning Of Terse Information in a Visualization of Emotion\u201d (EMOTIVE) [15]. Dahal used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and sentiment analysis model to extract topics and calculate the sentiment index from Twitter data related to climate change [16]. Wang analyzed the temporal-spatial characteristics, topic distribution, and retweet network of Twitter data related to wildfires via kernel density estimation (KDE), text mining, and social network analysis [17]. Ye divided Weibo texts related to dengue fever into five topics and found that the temporal-spatial characteristics of Weibo texts were related to the dynamics of dengue fever based on LDA [18]. Zong conducted content analysis and temporal analysis on tweets related to chemical plant explosions in Tianjin, China [19]. These progresses in social media mining and analysis enabled the researchers to obtain public opinions in the early stages of COVID-19.",

Since 20 January, they have shown an upward trend during the shock. \u201cMaking donations\u201d and \u201cseeking help\u201d are relatively lagging behind. In the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, a sudden increase in the confirmed cases caused a shortage of hospital beds. Due to this, patients with suspected cases of COVID-19 had to be in isolation at home. This demonstrated that the planning and allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. Then, with the establishment of the Huoshenshan and Leishenshan Hospitals (Wuhan) in early February, this situation was relieved but not resolved thoroughly. On 23 January Wuhan was on lockdown, the \u201cmaking donations\u201d began to rise steadily and rose significantly after 4 February. \u201cSeeking help\u201d started to significantly climb after 4 February and on 5 February, the curve reached its peak when an additional online help channel was opened. The above characteristics indicate that public expressing opinions in emergencies is not random but has periods of silence and noise that are highly volatile and vulnerable to external influences. These results are consistent with previous studies of public responses in emergency situations. The public sentiment in Twitter was highly correlated with external factors, such as the impact from official mass media, important social events, extreme weather, and public holidays [29,30].",

(1) The topics with a proportion of more than 60% were \u201cevents notification\u201d, \u201cpopularization of prevention and treatment\u201d, and \u201cgovernment response\u201d.

This finding indicates that timely release of information from the government was helpful in stabilizing public opinion in the early stage of COVID-19. (2) The temporal changes in Weibo texts are synchronous with the development of the COVID-19 outbreak. Public opinions during epidemic outbreaks are volatile and vulnerable to external influences. The spatial distribution of COVID-19- related Weibo texts shows a distribution pattern that Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration were significant high-value areas besides Wuhan. This means that the temporal-spatial distribution of opinions was related to the severity of the epidemic, the degree of population aggregation, and the level of economic development. (3) The spatial distribution of public opinions is regionally different and has a scale feature, exhibiting aggregation characteristics in cities, provincial border areas, and key urban agglomeration regions. Though in small quantities, the \u201cseeking help\u201d and \u201cmaking donations\u201d topics can directly provide support for emergency response and post-disaster management. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the public opinion response and epidemic prevention and control in the key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level; in addition, it should formulate accurate response countermeasures following the public\u2019s demands in controlling the crisis. This study contributes to existing research on uncovering knowledge regarding emergencies from social media by presenting a reliable approach to mining people\u2019s detailed opinions about COVID-19.

            "text": "Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. First, the specific reasons for the temporal-spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts need further exploration with more information. Second, the paper only analyzed texts from social media, while other content, such as pictures and videos in blogs, may also be informative. Third, there are manipulated opinions on social media (e.g., \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ctroll opinions\u201d). Thus, the better quantification of the noise caused by manipulated opinions needs further investigation. In addition, reducing the noise caused by manipulated opinions in social media data needs to be explored further. With COVID-19, which has been characterized as a pandemic by WHO [31], we will continually acquire new data from Weibo, train and improve the model, analyze the changes and driving mechanisms of public opinion, and provide active references for governmental responses.",
