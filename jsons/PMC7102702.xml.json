            "text": "Human blood collected and accumulated a vast trove of biochemical molecules while going through different organs or tissues, which can ultimately reflect the physiological or pathological status of the body [1], [2], and thereby provide valuable information for early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as for the monitoring of therapeutic efficiency. Cumulative evidence suggests that low-molecular-weight (LMW) region of human serum proteome, including small intact proteins, truncated fragments of larger proteins, along with some other small components, has been implicated in various human diseases such as cancer [3], diabetes [4], cardiovascular [5], and infectious diseases [6] and represents a treasure trove of diagnostic molecules. There are several facts that might support this view. To begin with, the LMW proteins are usually made up of physiologically important proteins such as cytokines, growth factors, peptide hormones, as well as proteins/peptides originating from normal cell or tissue leakage as a result of cell death or damage, which are believed to be more important to reflect valuable disease-related information than high-abundant proteins from a diagnostic point of view [7], [8]. For instance, the LMW protein family human serum amyloid A (SAA), a hot spot in the field of biomarker research, has been associated in various types of cancers such as ovarian cancer [9], lung cancer [10], pancreatic cancer [11], as well as the other diseases like coronary artery disease, obesity, and severe acute respiratory syndrome [12], [13], [14]. Moreover, increasing evidence shows that tumor cells excrete biomolecules (< 10 kDa) to the bloodstream that are specific to the tumor type at a rate proportional to the tumor age/size [15], [16]. Second, the LMW proteins are readily to enter the blood. In contrast to larger proteins, which enter the bloodstream intact only if they are actively secreted, or if the vascular wall becomes permeable owing to disease, the LMW proteins are small enough to enter the blood passively and produce diagnostic traces [2]. In fact, many LMW proteins and peptides that potentially contain disease-specific information were found to be fragments derived from larger parent molecules that are normally too large to passively diffuse through the endothelium into the circulation. Third, proteinase-mediated ex vivo enzymatic cleavage as part of the coagulation and complement activation pathways also leads to the produce of the LMW protein biomarkers. This is really true as circulating blood already contains an abundance of protein fragments apparently derived from cells and tissues that are produced in vivo. For instance, Villanueva and coworkers showed that diagnostic protein fragments can be generated ex vivo by circulating enzymes derived from the diseased tissue microenvironment acting on exogenously derived peptides produced by serum collection methodology [17].",

            "text": "However, identification of LMW proteins from human serum/plasma is analytically challenging due to several aspects. First, the dynamic complexity of serum/plasma, spanning more than 10 orders of magnitude in terms of concentration, greatly hinders the characterization of LMW proteins. As we known, many high-abundant proteins exist at concentrations billion-fold higher than those of the low-abundant LMW proteins thereby masking the potential LMW protein biomarkers and hindering their detection. For instance, in the human plasma proteome, 22 abundant proteins, including albumin, immunoglobulin, fibrinogen, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, are responsible for 99% of the bulk mass of the total protein content in human plasma [7], [18]. Some proteins like albumin can even reach concentrations of 35\u201350 mg/mL in serum [8]. Second, compounded by the relatively low concentration of LMW biomarkers present in the circulation (levels of some LMW proteins in serum were estimated to be as low as picomole or even femtomole), accurate and consistent comprehensive measurement is difficult. Moreover, cumulative evidence shows that many LMW proteins in serum consisted of truncated soluble forms resulting from an in vivo or ex vivo cleavage, which further lowers the concentration of these proteins and decreases their detectability. Indeed, degradation of target biomarkers occurs during transportation and storage of blood, leading to serious false-positive and false-negative results. Third, filtration of molecules through the glomerular capillary wall (glomerular filtration) is highly dependent on molecule size and is referred to as the filtration-size threshold [19], which means the size of a protein generally determines how fast it would be cleared from the blood by kidney filtration and uptake by the liver. For instance, insulin achieves 100% renal filtration with a blood half-life of only 9 min [20]. Therefore, LMW molecules generated in vivo would be cleared rather quickly, thereby reducing the concentration of the molecule to potentially undetectable levels. Last but not least, the effective way for a small proteins to avoid to be rapidly cleared as mentioned earlier and stay in circulation is to hitch a ride with a carrier protein. This is really true as many studies have showed that LMW biomarkers are associated noncovalently with high-molecular-weight (HMW) protein [21]. Therefore, removing HMW proteins from the sample may further dilute the samples from LMW biomarkers.",

            "text": "The simplest approach to deplete high-abundant proteins from serum would be to precipitate the proteins with organic solvent (methanol or acetonitrile) or ammonium sulfate (or other inorganic salt). Most of the HMW proteins (MW > 20 kDa) would be precipitated, and only lower-molecular-weight ones would remain in the supernatant. So far, acetonitrile precipitation, which has been shown to effectively precipitate large, abundant proteins out of serum, is believe to be a superior method to remove serum albumin and immunoglobulins from serum [25]. This may due to the facts that ACN not only denatures these large proteins allowing for their removal but causes the small, low-abundance proteins and peptides normally bound to these carrier proteins to dissociate, thus making them available for detection [8]. Indeed, our experience suggests that mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of serum LMW proteins was greatly improved with enhanced signal intensity and higher resolution (Fig. 2\n), which facilitated tracing of the targeted proteins [26]. However, caution is required, as the risk of coprecipitating the low-abundant proteins would be great.",

However, it is critical to disrupt the peptide/protein\u2013protein interactions prior to centrifugal ultrafiltration to released LMW components bound to larger species, as many physiologically important low-abundant proteins are often found to be bound to carrier proteins in plasma [18]. Moreover, it is important to recognize that retention of a protein by centrifugal ultrafiltration membrane is determined by a variety of factors, including molecular weight, molecular shape, electrical charge, sample concentration, buffer composition, and operating conditions. Therefore, multiple studies showed that HMW proteins will still appear in the filtrate when use different commercially available filter membranes. One of the reasons was supposed to be that the shape of some HMW proteins changes after denature, thereby leading their size change and making them pass through the membrane. Therefore, multidimensional separation, such as the combination of centrifugal ultrafiltration and reversed-phase solid-phase extraction, was recommend to improve the enrichment of LMW proteins and peptides [27].",

            "text": "The organic solvent precipitation and centrifugal ultrafiltration approaches mentioned earlier are quite nonselective because it generally removes the HMW proteins. To remove high-abundant proteins from serum more specifically, many techniques based on affinity matrices such as antibodies, antibody-mimicking peptides, or other kinds of natural compounds are often employed. For instance, the most popular method to remove HSA is using Cibacron Blue-based affinity chromatography [28], [29]. For depletion of immunoglobulin, the second most abundant serum/plasma protein, the use of immobilized protein A or G media, which specifically binds to the Fc region of IgG, is the technique of choice [30]. However, the depletion of HSA by dye-based resins is not entirely straightforward due to the enormous load of HSA species in serum and plasma and nonspecific binding of some other serum proteins as well [31]. Moreover, Cibacron Blue dye does not only show affinity for albumin but also for NAD, FAD, and ATP-binding sites of proteins, which often results in the unwanted removal of proteins of interest [32], [33], [34]. In addition, the protein A for antibody capture also shows widely varying degrees of affinity for the antibody isotypes and subtypes, which results in incomplete removal of some subtypes of IgG. Therefore, the use of specific ligands for the capture of HSA and IgG, such as antibodies, was employed. Steel and coworkers demonstrated to develop an immune-affinity resin using monoclonal antibodies against HSA to effectively removal of both full-length HSA and many of the HSA fragments present in serum, which shows markedly better performance than dye-based resins in terms of both the efficiency and specificity of albumin removal [31]. Furthermore, when a protein G affinity resin is used together with the immunoaffinity resin, IgG and HSA can be simultaneously removed from the samples.",

Thus, the selective simultaneous removal of more than a single high-abundance protein became more desirable. During the last decades, there has been a gradual development of several multiple affinity removal columns for the simultaneous depletion of even more high-abundant proteins. The multiple affinity removal system (MARS) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California), which combines the specificity of antibody\u2013antigen recognition and the efficiency of standard liquid chromatography, was one of the first MARS on the market. The affinity column removes HSA, IgG, transferrin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, and immunoglobulin by using six affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that bonded to polymeric microbeads via their Fc region.",

These products are claimed to be ranging from the depletion of 4 proteins all the way up to more than 20 proteins, such as Seppro IgY14 and ProteoPrep 20 (Sigma Aldrich), as well as ProteoSpin (Norgen Biotek Corp.) However, cautions are required, as recent evidence has shown that increasing the number of depleted proteins from 12 to 20 had only little beneficial effect and could in fact even increase the removal of peptides and proteins of interest which are associated with the abundant proteins [24], [36]. In addition, the next layer of abundant protein, moderately abundant proteins, after separating the highly abundant proteins, becomes an obstacle to access the low-abundant proteins. To tackle this challenge, Fang and coworkers further developed the IgY-microbead system by immunizing chickens with a flow-through fraction of IgY12 column and constructing the column with affinity-purified IgY antibodies against the flow-through proteins of IgY12 column, which enabled specific capturing of 207 moderately abundant proteins and thereby enables deeper and more effective access into the population of LAPs [37].",

            "text": "One of such enrichment processes is magnetic beads coated with ligands of interest, which enable identifying low-abundant LMW protein faster, more efficiently, and at lower cost than other methods. This may primarily due to the fact that magnetic particles comprise a convenient solid support for a variety of assays and procedures based on affinity purification. For instance, the high density of the beads allows rapid capture by magnetic devices, while the visibility of the beads ensures reliable collection of all target protein bound in the immunoprecipitation/pull-down application, which allows concentration of low-abundant target protein samples from milliliter down to microliter scale. Anderson and coworkers reported a SISCAPA (stable isotope standards and capture by antipeptide antibodies) method for specific antibody-based capture of individual tryptic peptides from a digest of whole human plasma based on a simplified magnetic bead protocol [38]. With this protocol, selected tryptic peptides of \u03b11-antichymotrypsin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were enriched relative to a high-abundance serum albumin peptide by 1800- and 18,000-fold, respectively, as measured by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). In contrast to the magnetic bead, which is of excellent properties for small-scale experiments, the experimental features of antibody microarrays have the advantages of performing the simultaneous enrichment of several hundreds of proteins in parallel [39]. Desrosiers and coworkers demonstrated a proteomic analysis of human plasma proteins using antibody arrays coated with 350 antibodies directed against signaling proteins after removal depletion of high-abundance proteins [40]. The results showed that antibody microarrays allowing the identification of 61 lower-abundance plasma proteins using 350 antibodies directed against signaling proteins, and authors suggest that this strategy is a valuable approach for detecting potential plasma biomarkers. An alternative and innovative strategy is based on a combinatorial solid-phase library, also called ProteoMiner (ProteoMiner technology, BioRad) [41]. This combinatorial solid-phase library contains a large and highly diverse library of hexapeptides bound to a chromatographic support, allowing each unique hexapeptide to bind to a unique protein sequence. When the sample is added, the limiting binding capacity of the beads enables high-abundance proteins to rapidly saturate their ligands, and excess protein is washed out.",

However, prior efforts in the search for serum and plasma protein biomarkers utilized gel-based separation technologies showed that gel cannot readily separate and distinguish molecules of less than 10 kDa in size [57]. In contrast, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, coupling with MS, is highly automated and has the capacity to separate low-abundance proteins for subsequent detachment and thus widely used to separate the proteins in serum/plasma before or after high-abundant protein depletion. In a typical ESI-MS/MS-based experiment, especially LC-MS/MS approach, protein is digested into peptides, and then peptide ions are selected in the mass spectrometer for fragmentation to generate tandem mass spectra for sequencing, which involving automatic and sophisticated bioinformatics tools. In laser desorption/ionization techniques (SELDI or MALDI) based experiment, many reports of biomarker were limited to a general description of protein peaks, due to the inherent low resolution and mass accuracy of SELDI-TOF-MS or limited capability of tandem MS/MS for protein analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS. Therefore, an additional efficient isolation procedure is needed for a further elucidation of LMW protein identities. Our group has developed an approach combining ZipTip-C18 pipette tip desalting, acetonitrile (ACN) precipitation, reverse-phase C18 HPLC purification, and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (Fig. 3\n), which we believed is suitable to profiling, purification, and identification of low-abundance, LMW targeted proteins in human serum. Using this workflow, we purified and identified 10 SAA isoforms with or without truncations from sera of advanced-stage cancer patients [26].",

MRM is typically carried out in triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometers, in which the first mass analyzer (Q1) is set to only transmit the target ion of the selected peptide, the collision energy is optimized to produce diagnostic charged fragments from this ion in the second mass analyzer (Q2), and the third mass analyzer (Q3) is set to transmit one to three selected diagnostic fragments for monitoring (Fig. 4A). The advantages of MRM compared to other quantitative analytical methods such as Western blotting, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry include multiplexed detection and the ability to use spiked-in, stable isotope-labeled standards to foster the absolute or precise relative quantification of endogenous analytes. The MRM assay approach has been applied to the measurement of various low-abundant specific peptides in tryptic digests of plasma, such as C-reactive protein [60] and prostate-specific antigen [61].",

            "text": "PRM, first published in 2012, is a targeted proteomics strategy where all product ions of the target peptides are simultaneously monitored at high-resolution and high mass accuracy [62]. The principle of PRM is comparable to SRM/MRM, but it permits the parallel detection of all target product ions in one high-resolution mass analysis, as the third quadrupole of a QQQ mass spectrometer is substituted with a high-resolution and accurate-mass analyzer in PRM case (Fig. 4B). There are several advantages of PRM when compared to MRM. To begin with, the PRM performs a full scan for fragment ions, instead of recording just 3\u20135 transitions as in MRM, enables high-quality quantitative measurements. Moreover, the background interference could be greatly eliminated with high resolution and accuracy, thus improve the detection limit and sensitivity in complex background effectively. In addition, requiring minimal upfront efforts for selection of target transitions and optimization of fragmentation energy facilitates assay development. Thus, PRM was believed to be suitable for quantification of multiple proteins in low abundant in complex sample. For instance, Kim and coworkers have developed a PRM assay to selectively measure isotypes of SAA and successfully measured five allelic variants (1\u03b1, 1\u03b2, 1\u03b3, 2\u03b1, 2\u03b2) of SAA1 and SAA2 in plasma samples from lung cancer patients [63]. Ronsein et al. have developed a PRM method for quantification of the high-density lipoprotein proteome in plasma samples using 15N-labeled apolipoprotein A-1 as an internal standard [64].",

For instance, even though with significant recent advances, current proteomics technologies still fall short of being able to reliably detect in blood plasma low ng/mL to sub-ng/mL protein concentrations, a level of detection often required for discovering disease-specific biomarkers. Moreover, the depletion of high-abundance proteins could potentially alleviate their \u201cmasking\u201d effect; however, the removal or reduction of the high-abundance proteins without affecting the minor proteins represents a challenge. Furthermore, sample preparation introduces preanalytical variations and poses major challenges to analyze the serum proteome.
