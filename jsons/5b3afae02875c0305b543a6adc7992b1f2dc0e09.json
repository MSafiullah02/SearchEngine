By using a meanfield approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for SIS and SIR epidemic models for a general adaptive strategy, which strongly depends on the correlations between activity and attractivenesses in the susceptible and infected states. We focus on a strong adaptive behaviour, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards non-quarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one, and that in SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to reach containment.",

            "text": "Introduction. Understanding the effects of changes in the behaviour of individuals during epidemics is essential to improve response strategies and to foster containment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This problem is nowadays particularly relevant, due to the extraordinary measures, massively introduced to limit recent disease spreading [6] [7] [8] [9] . In the presence of epidemics, people adapt their behaviour, modifying their actions in several ways. Infected individuals partially or totally reduce their activity, due to the appearance of symptoms or, if they are asymptomatic, due to limitations. Analogously, infected individuals can experience a reduction in their attractiveness, due to the self-protective behaviour of other individuals, who try to avoid contacts with the infected ones. All these adaptive behaviours lead to a change in activity, which can be realized in different ways, due to the peculiar structure of the society or to the perception of severity. As an example, as seen in recent real case studies [4, 10] , depending on the possibility to implement strong containment measures, limitation of activity in a population can be implemented in an active or inactive way. In the former, individuals avoid contacts with infected nodes, but they can readdress their activity towards non infected individuals, only shifting their focus. In the latter, individuals really become less active, in the sense that if a link is to be established with an infected node, the individual decide not to take the action, therefore reducing the overall activity of the system. A modelling framework of these effects could help in quantifying the relevance of quaran- * Electronic address: alessandro.vezzani@unipr.it tine measures [11, 12] , and to assess how important is the rapidity of adoption of adaptive measures to reach containment in the population. Simplified models, amenable to analytic control but still including the relevant dynamics, can be of some help here, as they allow testing the relevant parameters best-affecting disease containment and they can lead to uncovering counterintuitive effects, related to feedback processes in the dynamics. The natural framework to model epidemics is that of temporal networks, where links between nodes evolve in time on the same time scale of the dynamical process [1, 5, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

In activity-driven networks, the propensity to engage an interaction is modelled by assigning to each node an activity potential, measuring the typical number of activations (link formations) per time performed by the agent, plus an attractiveness, describing how likely it is for a node to be contacted by others [30] . The adaptive behaviour results in a change in activity and attractiveness due to infection, expressed through a general distribution function for activity and attractiveness in infected and susceptible nodes. By using an activity-attractiveness based mean-field approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for SIS and SIR epidemic models, holding for all active and inactive adaptive strategies. We also obtain analytically the epidemic prevalence of the SIS process (endemic state), while for the SIR active phase we perform numerical simulations. Interestingly, the threshold strongly depends on the correlations between the activities and attractivenesses in the susceptible and infected states. In particular, we focus on active and inactive quarantine, showing that the two containment measures have the same epidemic threshold, but they strongly differ in the dynamic of the active phase. As a result, the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic compared to the inactive one, near to the epidemic threshold. We also uncover the strong effects of early adoption of quarantine measures. We show that early adoption can potentially allow to contain the epidemic with an active quarantine, without affecting the activity of the healthy, while a late adoption requires a strong reduction of the overall activity to reach an effective containment.",

Node activations occur with a Poisson process, with activation rate a S or a I , according to the node's status. Initially all N nodes are disconnected and when a node activates it creates m links with m randomly selected nodes (hereafter we fix m = 1): the probability to contact a node with attractiveness b i (with i = S, I) is given by p bi = b i /\u03b1, where \u03b1 is a normalization factor and depends on the adaptive behaviour as we will discuss. All links are deleted after a time step and the procedure is iterated. If a link connects an infected I and a susceptible S node, a contagion occurs with probability \u03bb: S + I \u03bb \u2212 \u2192 2I, otherwise nothing happens.

In the active quarantine an active node selects randomly its contact among the non-quarantining nodes: links directed to quarantining nodes are effectively rewired towards potentially susceptible or non-quarantining infected nodes. Dynamical link rewiring can produce non-trivial effects on epidemic spreading, as observed in [11] for static network. This behaviour creates a temporally connected cluster of notquarantining nodes and this can strengthen the epidemic [11, 33] . In the inactive case the population does not compensate the ineffective links towards nodes in quarantine, by forming links with other nodes, and their activation in that case will not be effective. We consider a system with b S = ca S , accordingly to observations on real data [30] , which denote a linear corre-lation between the two parameters, identifying the presence of hubs which are very active, generating many links, and very attractive, receiving just as many. If a fraction \u03b4 of the population performs quarantine (a I = b I = 0), while the remaining 1 \u2212 \u03b4 keeps a I = a S and b I = b S , we get \u03c1(a S , a I , b",

In particular, in this range of parameters, our findings support the crucial role of timing in the adoption of containment measures. If the measures are implemented immediately, both active and inactive strategies are effective in reducing the infection peak of 75%-85% (depending on \u03b4) compared to the NADwA case. However, any delay in the adoption of quarantine measures produces a drastic re-duction in the effectiveness of the strategies. More interestingly, the differences between the two strategies increases in the case of a late adoption. This means that if containment measures are not immediately taken, an inactive quarantine, of a more stringent type, also binding the healthy to decrease their activity, is required to produce an effective result. With an early adoption, of course an inactive quarantine is still the best choice, but if this strong social distancing cannot be implemented for social reasons, an active strategy, focusing only on infected individuals, is still able to produce strong containment.",
