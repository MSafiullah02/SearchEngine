For example, RSV and Influenza virus can only be detected during a short timeframe and a positive test usually reflects active infection. Other viruses can be detected for a long time even when clinical symptoms are not present anymore. In HBoV infections a high rate of co-infection occurs [28] and prolonged HBoV shedding is common [29], [30]. This is important in the interpretation of the test results with regard to the time of sampling: early or late in the disease period. Most RT-PCR studies are cross-sectional, based on one single nasal washing specimen sample in a period of clinical symptoms, while ideally, a rise and fall in CT value would be necessary to correlate CT value with disease course. The cross-sectional design of our study is a limitation with regard to this. Furthermore, respiratory pathogens may also be detected in asymptomatic children, probably reflecting the natural virus colonization or asymptomatic infection in an individual in a certain period [31], [32].",

However, the sample size itself is difficult to quantify and some methods are more invasive than others. The quality and volume of nasal wash fluid and other samples (concentration of epithelial cells and/or leucocytes), may vary considerably. Most of the studies have not corrected for the amount of human DNA, epithelial cells or leucocyte counts in nasal wash specimen samples. This is also a limitation of our study. In an individual (adult) patient in our laboratory we found a 1000 fold difference in human DNA concentration between two broncho-alveolar lavage samples, taken by the same pulmonologist, potentially reflecting a similar difference in viral sample size (unpublished observation). Differences in the RT-PCR methods itself may influence sensitivity of the test too. The sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCRs is generally lower than that of single target PCRs [33]. The efficiency of the first step of the RT-PCR procedure, nucleic acid extraction, may vary between samples with different composition and nucleic acid concentrations. The efficiency of both steps may vary considerably between different target sequences. A given RNA or DNA concentration may result into different CT values depending on the target sequence, on the reverse-transcription and polymerase enzymes, and on the reaction conditions used. Furthermore, RNA viruses have a linear amplification step during the reverse transcription before the (exponential) PCR reaction. Therefore, the CT-value as such cannot be used to determine which virus is most important in multiple viral infections. In addition, interpretation of differences in viral load between RNA and DNA is complicated (Table 1). Finally, cut-off values of CT in RT-PCR are also important. Karpinnen et al. found significant differences in the amount of virus between cases and controls, suggesting that cut-off levels for CT have to be defined in order to provide adequate interpretation of positive test results [34]. The cut off value for a positive RT-PCR test result of 45 in our study is probably too high.",

CT values and continuous clinical parameters with an abnormal distribution like LOS, length of oxygen use and DSS at initial presentation should be correlated with each other using Spearman correlation. We suggest that only statistically significant correlations with a rho > 0.6 are relevant for clinical decision making. Studies on this topic, correlating CT values with disease outcome frequently lack information on Spearman\u2019s coefficient and should therefore be evaluated with much caution. We did not find a correlation between the CT value of RSV single infections and disease severity at initial presentation (rho \u22120.029, p 0.678, n = 202), as was also reported by Houben et al. in children during their first respiratory tract infection in life (rho \u22120.68, p 0.02, n = 11) [11]. For HCoV, the correlation between CT values and DSS was statistically significant. However, the Spearman\u2019s rho (\u22120.548) indicates only a moderate correlation. We therefore do not consider this finding as relevant for clinical practice. The significant correlation between CT value and length of oxygen use in children with infection by influenza also had a moderate rho (rho 0.550, p 0.027), indicating little clinical importance. Besides these difficulties in the interpretation of rho values for continuous variables, statistically significant differences in dichotomous variables are sometimes not of clinical importance. We showed a statistically significant difference between median CT values of RSV single infection of hospitalized versus non-hospitalized children (23.17 versus 24.57, p = 0.040). However, although this relation is statistically significant, the median CT values are close together and their interquartile ranges are overlapping (5.64 versus 5.14, data not shown in table). This does not help the clinician to discriminate between sick and non-sick children.",

This correlation was not found in RV single infections, suggesting that a low viral load of RV in RSV-RV multiple infections is correlated with a more severe disease course. In multiple infections including RV (RV + any other virus), the correlation between CT value of RV and oxygen use was moderate (rho 0.552, p 0.005) and for LOS this relation was not significant. In multiple infections in which RV is included, but RSV is excluded (RV + any other virus except RSV), no relations between CT values of RV and clinical parameters were found. A recent study suggests that the presence of RSV reduces the probability of RV infection, but if a co-infection occurs, both viruses cause clinical symptoms [35]. Unfortunately, CT values were not reported in this study. Our study adds that in case of these RSV-RV multiple infections, a more severe disease course may be correlated with a low viral load of RV.
