            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a pneumovirus that was first identified in the Netherlands in 2001 [1]. It is a ubiquitous virus, with most children being infected by 5 years of age, but continuing to experience re-infections throughout life [1]. Studies have shown that HMPV is identified in 3.9%\u20138.5% of children with clinical symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) who are hospitalised [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. The attributable fraction of HMPV (proportion of children who have HMPV detected where HMPV is considered to be the cause of the illness) to infected children with respiratory symptoms has been calculated to be between 73\u201390%, similar to that of RSV and influenza [6,7]. Annual rates of hospitalisation in children under 5 years of age associated with HMPV are approximately 1 in 1000 in the United States (US) [8]. This is a similar burden to influenza (1 in 1000) but lower than RSV (3 in 1000) [8]. Estimates of the prevalence of HMPV within the community setting are more variable and are influenced by the cohort being sampled, values range from 1.3% to 20% of those with symptoms of URTI/LRTI [[9], [10], [11]]. A study of 3257 children in the US has estimated the annual outpatient burden of HMPV to be 55 clinic visits and 13 emergency department visits per 1000 children [8].",

It can cause a range of clinical syndromes from a mild URTI to severe LRTI requiring intensive care [1]. A study examining children presenting to an emergency department in Milan, Italy found that children with HMPV infection presented with mild URTIs, pharyngitis, acute otitis media, croup, acute wheeze, acute bronchiolitis and pneumonia [12]. A large study of children under 5 years of age admitted to hospital with respiratory illness or fever in the US showed that children with HMPV infections were more likely to need supplemental oxygen than their HMPV-negative counterparts (53% versus 36%) and had a longer average stay in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) (4.5 days versus 2 days) [8]. A study comparing the characteristics of children admitted to PICU with HMPV and RSV found that children with HMPV were more likely to present with pneumonia or pneumonitis than those with RSV (29% vs. 16%), but that both groups required similar levels of invasive and non-invasive ventilation [13]. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for HMPV infection [14].",

This may have been due to increasing incidence of the virus, however, it is more likely to be attributable to increased awareness of HMPV as a potential pathogen and therefore increased testing specifically for it as well as an increase in the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing which detects multiple pathogens from a single sample. Other possible explanations include that six new PICU\u2019s (of a total of 34) began adding data from their units to PICAnet during the course of this study, or that there was an overall 15% increase in PICU admissions in the UK over the study period [18].",

It is also clear that HMPV has a seasonal variation in its incidence with a \u2018peak season\u2019 occurring between November and May, with the maximal incidence occurring in April. Similar seasonal patterns have been shown by other studies in the northern hemisphere, with the season being noted to range from November through to May, with peaks occurring between February to April [8,[19], [20], [21], [22]]. Interestingly we found few cases in January despite there being more cases in the months either side. This may be due to the fact January is peak season for RSV and influenza and testing may have predominantly been focussed on these pathogens, especially in the early years of our study.",

Mortality in the study group was 4.4% (five children). Of those, four had HMPV only identified, with one also having rhinovirus detected. All five children required invasive respiratory support and four required inotropes. None of the children who died received renal replacement therapy or ECMO. Three had respiratory-related primary diagnoses including acute bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract infection implying HMPV was the primary cause of death in these children. We are unaware of previous studies systematically measuring HMPV mortality rates.

A similar study using PICAnet data looking at PICU admissions related to influenza between October 2003 and March 2017 showed an average of 64 PICU admissions per year. Assuming an average of 16,000 PICU admissions per year this would account for approximately 4 per 1000 PICU admissions [23]. Similar data for UK PICU admissions related to RSV are not available, however, one study has investigated all cause bronchiolitis admissions to UK PICUs. It is known that approximately 80% of bronchiolitis admissions are caused by RSV. If considering PICU admissions for bronchiolitis in infants under 1 year alone then those attributable to RSV within this cohort would be approximately 45 per 1000 PICU admissions [24]. The true burden of RSV admissions, including older children, will be far higher. If there is more routine and frequent testing for HMPV, as there is for RSV and influenza, the burden of HMPV may be continue to increase.",

We have described the burden of HMPV infection in PICUs at a national level over a nine-year period and calculated the associated healthcare costs. In line with other similar studies using coding data a significant limitation of our study is the fact that some cases of HMPV may have been incidental findings in children admitted to PICU for other reasons and some cases may have been incorrectly coded, thus leading to either an over- or underestimation of the true number of cases. This places some restrictions on conclusions that can be drawn about HMPV as a causative organism of the clinical characteristics observed. In addition to this, 8.8% of children had another infective pathogen coded in addition to HMPV during their stay. However, 91.2% of patients only had HMPV coded during their PICU stay and 84.2% of patients had a respiratory-based primary diagnosis suggesting HMPV was the reason for PICU admission for many children.",
