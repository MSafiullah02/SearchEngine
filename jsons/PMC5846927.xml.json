In any given gene, if only one codon is used to encode one particular amino acid, the ENC value will be 20 (extreme SCUB). If all synonymous codons of a particular amino acid are used equally, the ENC value will be 61 (almost no SCUB). The compositions of the G and the C nucleotides were calculated for the first, second, and third codon positions. Expected ENC values were calculated using the GC3 (GC composition at the third codon position) values.56 An ENC versus GC3 plot can be used to distinguish between the 2 major evolutionary forces, the mutational pressure and the translational selection, for the observed SCU patterns by displaying gene groupings along the expected ENC curve. This is true because these 2 major evolutionary forces are the ones that contribute to SCUB. Even though, in some cases, genetic drift can be considered as a factor shaping codon usage; the ENC versus GC3 plot will only give an indication of the influences of the mutational pressure and the selection pressure. In this research, ENC values were calculated according to the following equation56:",

The most heterogeneous base contents were found for significant negative correlations (Table 2). The G3, C3, and GC3 contents were found to have significant positive correlations with the overall GC content. No correlations were observed between G3 and C, T3 and A, and vice versa. These noncorrelations did not reveal any SCUB characteristics. The correlation analyses of nucleotide contents did not reveal the role of natural selection by the host.

The weak MPXV bias may be attributed to the ability of an MPXV to suppress antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses by inhibiting antiviral T-cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production without involving major histocompatibility complex molecules as this mechanism would reduce competition between the virus and the host, leading to efficient dissemination in the host.70 Monkeypox virus infection effectively inhibits the genes involved in stimulating innate immunity, thereby suppressing the expressions of proteins such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2, CCL5, and IL-6.71 Thus, these findings form the basis for the observed weak SCUB of the PCG across all examined MPXV genomes.",

This heterogeneity in the base composition suggests that base compositional constraints play an important role in shaping SCUBs in MPXV genomes. A similar heterogeneity in the base composition was reported in herpesviruses belonging to the family Poxviridae.7 Strand-specific codon usage was observed in MPXV genomes, whereas in the host genome, tissue-specific codon usage was reported; that is, in humans, the SCUBs of brain-specific, liver-specific, uterus-specific, testis-specific, ovary-specific, and vulva-specific genes were different from one another.74 The SCUB in an MPXV may not be due to the GC composition as no correlations were observed between the GC3 and the cumulative GC values at the first and the second codon positions. However, AT richness is directly linked with SCUB as most preferred codons were A/T ending. Gene length was weakly correlated with different COA axes in some MPXV genomes, for example, the West African genomes COP-58, MPXV-VRAIR7-61, and Sierra Leone with axis 3, and the Central African genomes V79-I-005 and Zaire-1979-005 with axis 1. In addition, based on our analysis using axis 1 of the COA (the principal axis explaining most of the variations), we suggest that gene length may have a significant influence on SCUB only in Central African strains such as V79-I-005 and Zaire-1979-005.",

The weak codon bias of most genes across all examined MPXV genomes suggests that selection for translational accuracy and speed has less influence in dictating SCUB, revealing an inability to act as expression vectors, as reported in herpesviruses, another class of large double-stranded DNA viruses.7 However, the putative optimal codons identified in this study can be used for enhancing heterologous gene expression by increasing translational efficiency.7,75-78 Axis 1 of the COA and the CAI exhibited significant positive correlations in all examined MPXV genomes (P < .01), indicating that gene expression levels have profound influences on SCUB.",

Moreover, Central African and West African MPXV genomes are genetically distinct.47 Cluster analysis showed clustering of Central African strains and one North African MPXV strain (Sudan-2005-01) into an upper cluster with similar SCUBs, whereas other strains isolated from West Africa and the United States formed a lower cluster with similar SCUBs. However, the lower cluster revealed that the US-isolated MPXVs possessed similar SCUBs as they are in one clade close to Liberia-1970-184. Furthermore, Central African strains have been reported to be more virulent than West African strains.47 Based on these results, we are able to postulate that a strong association exists between MPXV strain virulence and SCUB as more virulent strains formed one cluster exhibiting similar SCUBs, and less virulent strains formed another. Thus, we conclude that mutational pressure due to base compositional constraints, level of gene expression, and codon selection for utilization of putative optimal codons are major factors influencing the SCUB in MPXV genomes. Consequently, a balance exists between mutational pressure acting on nucleotide sequences and amino acid selection in MPXV genomes, which is similar to the finding in a report on hepatitis E viruses.1 Generally, to conserve the protein sequence, purifying selection eliminates transversions at the third codon positions in 2-fold degenerate amino acids. Among the 20 amino acids, most synonymous positions are in 2-fold degenerate amino acids. Hence, selection may act on an amino acid level to eliminate the possibility of nonsynonymous transversions in 2-fold degenerate amino acids. In addition, viral genomes have naturally evolved with a mechanism to tackle and escape host antiviral responses,28 and according to the evolution rhetoric theory,83 this mechanism may also act as a major selection pressure in framing the SCUB in MPXV genomes, as reported in hepatitis A viral genomes.28 In this context, the multifactorial codon usage bias in MPXV genomes might have evolved as the result of a need to increase the efficiency of communication from the genome to the cell in transitional environments by keeping the message unmodified.28,83",
