            "text": "The entry of enveloped viruses into host cells involves a fusion step between the viral and a cellular membrane. This process is mediated by viral fusion proteins that are associated with the viral membrane and primed to undergo structural rearrangements that drive fusion ( Kielian and Rey, 2006 ; Weissenhorn et al., 2007 ; Harrison, 2008 ; White et al., 2008 ) . These conformational changes are activated by specifi c triggers, allowing fusion to occur at the right time and at the right place in the viral life cycle. Different trigger mechanisms (and combinations thereof) have been identifi ed, including (a) interactions with cellular receptors, leading to fusion at the plasma membrane, and (b) protonation by the acidic pH in endosomes, leading to fusion from within endosomes after virus uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis ( White et al., 2008 ) . In the latter case, like in other protein systems of intracellular pH sensors ( Srivastava et al., 2007 ) , histidines have been discussed to play a key role as molecular switches because their protonation state changes from uncharged to doubly positively charged at the slightly acidic pH found in endosomes ( Carneiro et al., 2003 ; Bressanelli et al., 2004 ; Stevens et al., 2004 ; Kampmann et al., 2006 ; Kanai et al., 2006 ; Roussel et al., 2006 ; Mueller et al., 2008 ; Roche et al., 2008 ; Thoennes et al., 2008 ) .",

            "text": "So far, two structurally unrelated classes of viral fusion proteins have been identifi ed (class I in myxo-, paramyxo-, retro-, fi lo-, and coronaviruses and class II in \u2423 -and fl aviviruses; Kielian and Rey, 2006 ) , together with a third class that combines features of both class I and II (rhabdo-and herpesviruses; Weissenhorn et al., 2007 ; White et al., 2008 ) . They all comprise representatives that are triggered by acidic pH. Despite the knowledge of atomic structures from all three protein classes ( Weissenhorn et al., 2007 ; Harrison, 2008 ; White et al., 2008 ) , it proved diffi cult, both in experimental and molecular simulation approaches, to conclusively answer the question of whether the initial trigger for destabilization and conformational changes is provided by the protonation of individual histidine residues, by combinations thereof, or by a cumulative effect through the increase of positive charge ( Kampmann et al., 2006 ; Mueller et al., 2008 ; Thoennes et al., 2008 ) . In class II fusion proteins, the molecular sensors for triggering fusion have not yet been identifi ed. We therefore conducted a study in a prototypic class II fusion protein system (the fl avivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus [TBEV] ) and provide experimental evidence that the protonation of a specifi c histidine plays a key role for the destabilization of an intramolecular interface in the fusion protein and thus allows the initiation of the fusion process.",

It has been hypothesized that conserved histidines in the class II fusion protein E of these viruses function as molecular switches and, by their protonation, control the fusion process. Using the mutational analysis of recombinant subviral particles of tick-borne encephalitis virus, we provide direct experimental evidence that the initiation of fusion is crucially dependent on the protonation of one of the conserved histidines (His323) at the interface between domains I and III of E, leading to the dissolution of domain interactions and to the exposure of the fusion peptide. Conserved histidines located outside this critical interface were found to be completely dispensable for triggering fusion.",

            "text": "The RSPs of TBEV used in this study display similar fusion characteristics as infectious virions and are assembled in eukaryotic cells after transfection with plasmids that coexpress prM and E. Their maturation and secretion pathway follows that of whole virions, including the cleavage of prM in the trans-Golgi network to yield mature and fusion-active particles ( Schalich et al., 1996 ) . To obtain specifi c information on the molecular pH sensors of fusion, we replaced each of the fi ve absolutely encephalitis, West Nile, and TBE viruses ( Gubler et al., 2007 ) . The surface of mature fl aviviruses is made up of a herringbonelike assembly of 90 homodimers of the envelope glycoprotein E ( Kuhn et al., 2002 ; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003 ) . The atomic structures of soluble forms of E (sE), lacking the membrane anchor and the so-called stem ( Fig. 1 B ) , have been determined for different fl aviviruses in pre-and postfusion conformations ( Fig. 1, B and C ; Rey et al., 1995 ; Modis et al., 2003 Modis et al., , 2004 Modis et al., , 2005 Bressanelli et al., 2004 ; Zhang et al., 2004 ; Kanai et al., 2006 ; Nybakken et al., 2006 ) . In the prefusion conformation, the internal fusion peptide (FP) loop at the tip of domain II (DII) is buried through the interaction with a hydrophobic pocket provided by DI and III of the second partner in the homodimer ( Fig. 1 B ) . Exposure to acidic pH leads to the initiation of the fusion process as depicted in Fig. 1 D . Five histidine residues, located in DI, II, and III as well as in the stem region ( Fig. 1 , B and C ), are conserved among all fl avivirus E proteins and their function as pH sensors in fl avivirus fusion has been discussed ( Bressanelli et al., 2004 ; Kampmann et al., 2006 ; Kanai et al., 2006 ; Nybakken et al., 2006 ; Mueller et al., 2008 ) . To support this hypothesis experimentally, we used recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) of TBEV as a model and targeted the conserved histidines in a mutational approach. As shown previously, RSPs are excellent tools for studying fl avivirus fusion because they contain a lipid membrane, carry the E protein in a conformation that is indistinguishable from that uorescence (caused by dilution of the probe in the target membrane) was continuously monitored. Consistent with previous results ( Corver et al., 2000 ) , WT RSPs fused rapidly at pH 5.4 within the fi rst seconds after acidifi cation ( Fig. 2 A ) , and the fusion activities of mutants lacking a histidine residue at position 248, 287, or 438 were identical to that of the WT ( Fig. 2 B ) . The replacement of His323, however, resulted in the loss of fusion activity ( Fig. 2, A and B ), even at pH 5.0 (not depicted). We also analyzed combinations of mutations that alone did not affect fusion, i.e., H248N+H287A, H248N+H438N, and H287A+H438N. Unexpectedly, one of these combinations (H248N+H287A) impaired fusion to the same extent as did the replacement of His323 ( Fig. 2, A and B ) . These experiments revealed the importance of individual conserved histidines for E-mediated fusion, but it remained unclear at which stage or how certain residues were involved in this multistep process.",

To analyze the very fi rst step of the fusion process, we made use of an FP-specifi c mAb (A1) and developed an assay that allowed us to measure the acidic pH -induced conserved histidines (and combinations thereof) in the E protein of RSPs by alanine or other amino acids and investigated their effect on fusion and fusion-related properties. Any mutation introduced into this system can potentially also interfere with processes unrelated to fusion, such as proper protein folding, oligomerization, particle formation, intracellular transport, protein processing, and maturation and secretion of RSPs. We therefore performed a meticulous analysis of the mutant RSPs to ensure that the amino acid substitutions had not infl uenced their wildtype (WT) -like properties at neutral pH. This was accomplished by a series of quality control measures, including an analysis of the amount of RSPs secreted from transfected cells, the sedimentation behavior in sucrose gradients, the extent of the maturation cleavage of prM, the oligomeric state of E, and the reactivity of the RSPs with a panel of 22 mAbs. These mAbs recognize epitopes in each of the three domains of the mature E protein and have proven to be excellent tools for measuring conformational differences or changes Allison et al., 1995 Allison et al., , 2001 Stiasny et al., 2005 ) .",

For this purpose, the membranes of each of the mutant RSPs were fl uorescence labeled in vivo with 1-pyrenehexadecanoic acid and subjected to an in vitro fusion assay (see Materials and methods). These RSPs were mixed with unlabeled liposomes and the decrease in pyrene excimer displayed the same acidic pH -induced coflotation behavior as the WT. Because the double mutant H248N-H287A was completely fusion negative ( Fig. 2 ) , we made sure that its unimpaired coflotation was indeed only caused by binding to the liposomes, in the absence of fusion. For that purpose, cofl otation assays were performed with pyrene-labeled samples of the mutant and WT RSPs, and fl uorescence emission spectra were recorded with the cofl otated fractions. In the case of RSP H248N-H287A, a strong pyrene excimer peak (which equals no dilution of the fl uorescence probe) was observed, whereas it was strongly reduced with coflotated WT RSPs ( Fig. 4 C, inset ). These results thus allowed the unambiguous conclusion that the cofl otation with the double mutant, in contrast to that of the WT, was caused by an interaction with liposomes in the absence of fusion activity.",

In previous experiments, we had found that during conversion of E from the prefusion dimer to the postfusion trimer the accessibility of the FP for mAb A1 was transiently increased but lost upon conversion into the fi nal trimeric conformation ( Stiasny et al., 2007 ) . We therefore measured this transient FP exposure using an enzyme immunoassay in which the antibody was already present in the RSP samples at the time of their acidifi cation (see Materials and methods). The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3 . With the exception of mutant H323A, none of the three other single His mutants differed signifi cantly from the WT, neither with respect to the extent nor to the pH threshold of FP exposure (unpublished data). The same holds true for the double and triple mutants, which all displayed a WT-like pattern ( Fig. 3 ) . In contrast, FP exposure was severely impaired in the case of the H323A mutant, but the residual activity was induced at the same pH threshold as with the WT, i.e., around pH 6.6 ( Fig. 3 ) . These results allow us to conclude that of the four histidines analyzed only His323 plays an important role as an initial fusion trigger and that the lack of fusion activity observed with the double mutant H248N-H287A was caused by an impairment of later steps of fusion.",

To assess whether the observed FP exposure indeed correlated with the proposed functional activity, we performed liposome cofl otation experiments for measuring membrane binding. Preparations of WT and His mutant RSPs were mixed with liposomes, acidified, and applied to sucrose step gradients as described in Materials and methods. Cofl otation of E to the top of the gradients indicates either binding to or fusion with liposomes. The results of these experiments as depicted in Fig. 4 precisely matched those of the FP exposure assay ( Fig. 3 ) . With the exception of the severely impaired mutant H323A, all of the other single and combination mutants Because the mutations introduced into E may not only infl uence the formation of trimers but also their stability, we performed thermal denaturation experiments as follows. RSPs were acidifi ed, back-neutralized, solubilized, incubated at 37 or 70 \u00b0 C, and subjected to rate zonal sucrose density gradient centrifugation to determine the oligomeric state of E ( Fig. 7 ) . E trimers of the single mutants H248N, H287A, and H438N were as stable as WT trimers ( Fig. 7 and not depicted) . In contrast, not only was trimer formation with H323A and H248N-287A less effi cient ( Fig. 5 , C and D ) but also these trimers were sensitive to incubation at 70 \u00b0 C, as revealed by a strong reduction of the E trimer peak and an accumulation of presumably denatured and aggregated material in the pellet ( Fig. 7 ) . As expected, similar results were obtained when trimer formation was allowed to proceed in the presence of liposomes (unpublished data).",

            "text": "Although histidines have been speculated to play an important role as acidic pH sensors in class II viral fusion proteins ( Bressanelli et al., 2004 ; Kampmann et al., 2006 ; Kanai et al., 2006 ; Nybakken et al., 2006 ; Roussel et al., 2006 ; Mueller et al., 2008 ) , experimental evidence for such a role is still lacking. The mutational analysis presented in this work suggests that one of the fi ve conserved histidines in the TBEV E protein (His323) plays a dominant role in the initiation of the multistep fusion process. This amino acid residue forms part of an intricate intramolecular network of interactions between DI and III of the E monomer in its prefusion conformation, consisting of hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and a salt bridge between Arg9 in DI and Glu373 in DIII ( Fig. 8 A ; Bressanelli et al., 2004 ) . Both of these amino acids as well as several additional residues of this contact initiation of fusion. We therefore hypothesized that the lack of fusion observed with the double mutant H248N-H287A was caused by an impairment of later steps, such as the formation and/or stability of the E trimer. We addressed this question by sedimentation analyses and investigated the effect of each of the His mutations on the acidic pH -induced conversion of E dimers into trimers. Like with the WT RSPs, a quantitative E dimer to trimer transition was observed with the single mutants H248N, H287A, and H438N, as well as with the double mutants H248N-H438N and H287A-H438N ( Fig. 5, A and B ; and not depicted). In contrast, trimer formation was impaired with H323A and H248N-H287A ( Fig. 5, C and D ) . Similar to the situation found with the pH dependence of FP exposure ( Fig. 3 ) , the pH threshold for the oligomeric rearrangement was identical to the WT with all of the mutants (pH 6.6), irrespective of the amount of trimers formed ( Fig. 6 ) . ) , back-neutralized, solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and analyzed by sedimentation in 7 -20% sucrose gradients containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were fractionated, and the amount of E protein in each fraction was determined by a quantitative four-layer ELISA. The sedimentation direction is from left to right. Peak of the E dimer, fraction 8; peak of the E trimer, fraction 10. Figure 6 . pH threshold of E trimer formation of RSP WT and mutants. Extent and pH dependence of acidic pH -induced E trimer formation with WT and mutant RSPs as determined by rate zonal sucrose density centrifugation. Results are expressed as a percentage of E found in the trimer peak fractions relative to the total amount of E in the gradient. as their combinations did not impair FP exposure, the residual activity is probably related to the protonation of His146 and suggests a possible accessory role of this residue in the destabilization of the DI -DIII interface. Surprisingly, and in contrast to what has been observed for the infl uenza virus class I fusion protein hemagglutinin ( Thoennes et al., 2008 ) , none of the histidine mutations in this work affected the pH threshold of fusion-related processes. Flavivirus variants that exhibited a pH shift for membrane fusion were described to contain mutations in the DI -DII hinge region ( Rey et al., 1995 ; Harrison, 2008 ) , but the mechanism causing this behavior remains to be elucidated. It has been suggested, however, that these mutations infl uence the stability of E ( Modis et al., 2003 ) and thus may modulate the pH required to induce those conformational changes that drive fusion. Such \" stability effects, \" however, appear to be distinct from the actual pH-sensoring machinery, which apparently involves His323 and probably His146.",

            "text": "It is a further fi nding of our work that His323 apparently has a dual role in the fusion process and contributes both to the initial pH trigger and to the stability of the postfusion trimer. The lower stability of this mutant trimer could be a result of the lack of the salt bridge between His323 and Glu373 in the postfusion structure of DIII ( Fig. 8 B ) and a concomitant weakening of DIII-mediated trimer contacts and/or the proper positioning of the stem for zippering along the grooves provided by DII. None of the other conserved histidines (except His146, which was irreplaceable and therefore not amenable to analysis) seems to have a similar impact on E trimerization as His323 because their single replacements neither affected trimer formation nor trimer stability to a measurable extent ( Fig. 7 ) . An additive effect, however, was observed in the double mutant H248N-H287A, which was fusion negative and was impaired in trimer formation and trimer stability as was the mutant H323A. His287 forms part of the trimer interfaces ( Fig. 1 C ) and His248 is located at a position at the groove, close to the FP ( Fig. 1 C ) , that is likely to accommodate the stem during the \" zipping up \" process ( Fig. 1 D ) . Theoretically, the replacement of each of these residues alone could interfere with late stages of the fusion process, leading to the opening of the fusion pore. More specifi c interpretations of these results, however, will depend on the elucidation of the atomic structure of the stem in the postfusion structure of E and assays that distinguish between lipid and contents mixing. area are absolutely conserved among fl aviviruses ( Bressanelli et al., 2004 ) . The integrity of this domain interface is essential for the dimeric conformation of E in mature virions because only in this specifi c arrangement do the two domains together provide a protective pocket for the FP loop at the tip of DII of the second subunit ( Fig. 1 B and Fig. 8 A ) . Through these and other DII interactions, the monomeric subunits are fi xed in an antiparallel orientation in the E dimer. The release of these constraints is necessary for exposing the FP and allowing an outward projection of the E monomers as a prerequisite for target membrane interactions ( Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005 ; Stiasny and Heinz, 2006 ; Harrison, 2008 ) . Inspection of the postfusion structure suggests that His323 may form an intradomain salt bridge with Glu373. Because in the prefusion conformation Glu373 is part of the central salt bridge together with Arg9, the protonation of His323 is likely to contribute to the dissolution of this salt bridge and to the concomitant destabilization of the DI -DIII interface. The fact that the basic architecture of these networks is conserved in the pre-and postfusion forms of E from TBEV and the distantly related dengue 2 virus (His323 and His317 and Glu373 and Glu368, respectively) would argue for a similar mechanism of fusion initiation in all fl aviviruses ( Rey et al., 1995 ; Bressanelli et al., 2004 ; Modis et al., 2003 Modis et al., , 2004 .",

Indeed, there is only one conserved histidine at a strictly homologous position in E and E1. This residue (His248 in TBEV and His230 in Semliki Forest virus, respectively), however, has been ruled out as a pH sensor for both viruses and was shown to affect only a late stage of fusion ( Chanel-Vos and Kielian, 2004 Kielian, , 2006 ; this study). The major difference lies in the structural details of FP protection in the prefusion conformations of E and E1. In fl aviviruses, the FP in E is buried through homodimeric interactions, whereas in alphaviruses, the FP in E1 is protected by a heterodimeric interaction with a second, overlying protein (E2; Kielian, 2006 ) . Alphavirus fusion could therefore be triggered by the protonation of as yet unidentifi ed residues in both E1 and E2.",

Samples were back-neutralized with 150 mM triethanolamine, solubilized for 1 h at room temperature with 1% Triton X-100, and applied to 7 -20% (wt/wt) continuous sucrose gradients containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Centrifugation was performed for 20 h at 38,000 rpm at 15 \u00b0 C (rotor SW 40; Beckman Coulter). 0.6-ml fractions were collected by upward displacement using a Piston Gradient Fractionator, and the amount of E in each fraction was determined by an E-specifi c four-layer ELISA after treatment with 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 \u00b0 C for 30 min . To investigate the thermostability of the postfusion E protein, acidic pHpretreated and solubilized RSPs were incubated at 37 and 70 \u00b0 C before sedimentation analysis ( Stiasny et al., 2005 ) .
