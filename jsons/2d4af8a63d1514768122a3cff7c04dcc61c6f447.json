The most common indication for intensive care unit (ICU) admission is acute chest syndrome (ACS) [1] . Shock, stroke, and multiple organ failure are also potential causes of critical illness ( Fig. 6. 2) [2, 3] . In the United States and Great Britain, pediatric SCD patients account for roughly 2% of pediatric ICU (PICU) admissions. Eight percent of SCD patients will require at least one ICU admission within an 8-year follow-up [4] , and 13% of patients with ACS will require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation [5] . Even more alarming, the mortality of SCD patients admitted to the ICU can be as high as 44% [6] . Timely admission to the ICU facilitates better outcomes for patients, and it is imperative for physicians to regard even apparently uncomplicated vaso-occlusive episodes as potentially life threatening.",

ET-1 inactivates the production of nitric oxide (NO) from arginine, exacerbating vasoconstriction. (2) Inflexible sickled cells vaso-occlude capillaries resulting in ischemia and infarction. (3) SCD is an inflammatory state. Red cells adhere to platelet-monocyte aggregations via adhesion molecules like vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) in vaso-occlusive episodes. Hydroxyurea, one of the two FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for pediatric sickle cell disease, reduces sickling via the upregulation of fetal hemoglobin production and the reduction of circulating leukocytes, reducing inflammation and vaso-occlusion) Cardiovascular Concerns 23 .4% of SCD adult death at home or in the hospital is sudden [7] . This figure is not known in children, although pediatric patients with sickle cell trait alone have a 21-fold higher risk of sudden cardiac death than those with completely normal hemoglobin [8] . The cardiac concerns discussed below, particularly cardiomegaly, left ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension (PH), contribute to sudden cardiac death [9] . Appropriate management of the cardiac consequences of SCD will reduce this risk in the critical SCD ICU patient.",
