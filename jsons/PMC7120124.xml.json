            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 is an extensively studied group 2 coronavirus (CoV). Its genome is an approximately 31.5-kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA, which contains a 5\u2032 cap and poly(A) tail (1,2). The first two-thirds of the genome encodes the nonstructural proteins required for viral RNA replication and transcription, and the final third comprises six additional open reading frames (ORFs) from which a nested set of 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs is transcribed (Figs.\n1A,B\n3C). Upon entry into the cell, the N-encapsidated viral RNA is released from the virion and immediately translated by host machinery, resulting in large polyprotein precursors, which are autocleaved to generate intermediates and eventually 16 mature proteins, most of which are thought to function in viral RNA synthesis (3\u20136). The subgenomic mRNAs are generated from a similar-sized subgenomic negative strand, which is synthesized only after the viral replication complex is functional. The negative subgenomic RNA serves as a template for transcription of similar-sized subgenomic mRNAs, which contain the leader sequence as well as the ORF that encodes the protein directly downstream of the leader sequence (7\u201310). All subgenomic mRNAs are co-terminal, with each subsequent mRNA containing the sequence for all downstream ORFs, although only the 5\u2032-most ORF is translated. This allows for rapid detection of viral replication by RT-PCR using primers that anneal to the leader and the N-gene, which results in a ladder of different sized products (Figs.\n1B,\n3B,C) (7\u201310).\n\n",

Our laboratory developed a full-length molecular clone of MHV-A59 (icMHV) by implementing a No See\u2019m approach (Figs.\n1C,2A,B) (1\n3). Our strategy was to divide the genome into pieces that could be stably subcloned into E. coli-based plasmids to facilitate targeted mutagenesis studies and would be easy DNA to store and maintain, using the same approach that was successful with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infectious clone (1\n3,1\n4) (Figs.\n1C,2A,B). However, the MHV molecular clone was difficult to establish as several toxic regions existed in the genome. Consequently, several of the MHV cDNA fragments required subdivision into smaller subclones and cloning into transcription and translation negative vectors (Fig.\n2B)\n\n",

LB broth and LB agar plates with each antibiotic are required for growing the newly transformed bacteria. Although other vector-fragment combinations exist, we focus on the following in this report: pCR-XL-Topo-MHV-A, pSMART-MHV-B, pSMART-MHV-C, pSMART-MHV-D, pSMART-MHV-E, pSMART-MHV-F, and pSMART-MHV-G (1\n3).

In general, one 15-ml culture of each plasmid DNA insert is sufficient for assembling at least two full-length MHV clones. Incubate for 12\u201316 h at 28.5\u00b0C in an incubator shaker set at 250 rpm. Then add 5 ml of LB plus antibiotic and allow growth to continue for an additional 4\u20136 h under the same conditions.Spin the cultures at 3000 \u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and discard the supernatants. Resuspend the pellet in 750 \u03bcl of Qiagen Miniprep P1 Buffer and transfer equally to three 1.5-ml microfuge tubes. Purify plasmids using the Qiaprep Miniprep Kit, and elute to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl in elution buffer heated to 70\u00b0C. Combine all three 50-\u03bcl aliquots of each fragment in a single tube.Digest the plasmids as follows:\npCR-XL-Topo-MHV-A: 150 \u03bcl plasmid, 10 \u03bcl MluI, 20 \u03bcl NEB Buffer 3, 20 \u03bcl water. Incubate at 55\u00b0C for 1.5 h. Add 5 \u03bcl of CIP and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. CIP catalyzes the removal of 5\u2032 phosphate groups from DNA, which prevents concatamers of MHV-A from occurring during ligation (1\n5). CIP cannot be completely heat inactivated, so the reaction is chloroform extracted and isopropanol precipitated at this point to remove the CIP.\ni.For the chloroform extraction all steps are performed at room temperature: Add 25 \u03bcl of water, 50 \u03bcl 3 M sodium acetate, and 275 \u03bcl of chloroform to the reaction. Shake by hand for 2 min, and then spin at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 2 min. Remove the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and add an equal volume of isopropanol. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Spin for 5 min at full speed, remove the supernatant, and resuspend in 95% ethanol. Spin for 5 min, remove supernatant, and air-dry the pellet for no more than 5 min.

Incubate at 55\u00b0C for 2 h. Add 10 \u03bcl AhdI and incubate at 37\u00b0C for an additional 1.5 h. AhdI cuts the vector into two fragments, which allows the MHV-D fragment to be the largest band.pSMART-MHV-E: 150 \u03bcl plasmid, 10 \u03bcl BsmBI, 20 \u03bcl NEB Buffer 3, 20 \u03bcl water.

Add 10 \u03bcl of BsmBI and 20 \u03bcl NEB buffer 3 and incubate at 55\u00b0C for 2 h.\nIsolate the digested fragments by electrophoresis on a 0.8\u20131.0% gel in wells capable of holding 75 \u03bcl each (three wells per reaction) (Fig.\n2A). The restriction products should be run for enough time to allow for high resolution of individual fragments.Excise the top band of the correct size for each fragment from the gel, making sure that it corresponds to the size of the MHV fragment (Fig.\n2A) and is not an undigested vector-MHV fragment. Place the excised band in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube.Use the Qiaex II Gel Extraction Kit for extracting the DNA from the agarose as follows:\nUse the Qiaex II Agarose gel extraction protocol with the following modifications:\ni.Resuspend the excised band in 620 \u03bcl of QX1 buffer, 12.5 \u03bcl 3 M sodium acetate, and 11 \u03bcl QIAEX II resin. Incubate in a water bath at 55\u00b0C for a total of 12\u201316 min, agitating every 2 min. For fragments larger than 4 kb (MHV-A, MHV-B, MHV-F, and MHV-G), add 360 \u03bcl of water after 6 min of incubation. Follow the protocol for the remaining steps and elute to a final volume of 35 \u03bcl. Add the three replicates for each extraction into one tube (\u223c100 \u03bcl).\n\nA final chloroform only extraction is performed to remove any residual impurities that remain after the DNA extraction (see\nNote 1). Use a 1:1 volume of chloroform, shake for 2 min, and spin at top speed in a microcentrifuge at room temperature for 2 min. Remove the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.\n",

For passage, the medium is aspirated and the attached cells are washed. Cells are removed from the flask with 0.25% trypsin, and then resuspended and passaged in the medium. Splitting a confluent T150 flask of BHK-MHVr cells (e.g., \u223c2\u20133 \u00d7107 cells) the night before at 1:5 will generally produce a T150 at \u223c70% confluency the next day.Preparation of BHK-MHVr cells for transfection (per T150 flask):\nRemove the medium and wash the cells. Remove the cells from the flask with trypsin. Add 2 ml of trypsin to the flask and incubate for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. Remove cells from flask by tapping gently.Resuspend the trypsinized cells in 8 ml of medium and transfer cells from all three flasks to a sterile 50-ml conical.Spin the cells at \u223c2000 \u00d7g for 5 min and remove the medium, leaving the pellet in the conical.Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and spin at 2000 \u00d7g for 5 min.Remove the PBS and resuspend the pellet in an additional 10 ml of ice-cold PBS.Transfer 10 \u03bcl of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer for counting, and spin the remaining suspension at \u223c2000 \u00d7g for 5\u201310 min, while counting the cells.Remove the PBS from the cells and resuspend the pellet in the volume of PBS that will give a concentration of 107 cells/ml. Counting 10 \u03bcl of cells from a 10-ml preparation translates into 104 cells per 1 mm2 (grid of 16 squares arranged 4 \u00d74) on the hemocytometer. Count all the cells in three of the 16 square grids and average them. Then, multiply this number by 1 \u00d7104, which gives the concentration in cells/ml. In general, to get to a final concentration of 1 \u00d7107 cells/ml resuspend the final pellet in 1/100 of the final count. For example, if the final average count is 200 cells, this would calculate to 2.0 \u00d7106 cells/ml in a 10-ml volume for a total of 2.0 \u00d7107 cells. Resuspend in 2 ml of PBS to get to a final concentration of 1 \u00d7107 cells/ml. Keep cells on ice until ready for electroporation. A total volume of 1.6 ml of 1 \u00d7107 cells/ml is required for one transfection and one negative control.\nPreparation of DBT cells for infection. Only one confluent T150 flask of DBT cells is required.\nRemove the medium and wash the cells.

We typically recover between 1000 and 10,000 plaques (infectious center assay) following electroporation of transcripts. CPE is very obvious for DBT cells infected with MHV. Excess spike glycoproteins accumulate at and protrude from the cell surface, which facilitates fusion with the neighboring cells. This creates large multinucleated syncytia, which are usually observed by 8\u201312 h posttransfection. As the cells die, they lift off the flask, and so an efficient transfection of full-length viral RNA will result in a rapid clearing of the monolayer, usually within 16\u201324 h.Mutants generally come up more slowly and may take up to 72 h for CPE to be obvious. Highly debilitated mutants may not display obvious CPE. Passage usually selects for second-site revertant viruses that replicate efficiently, so extensive passage usually results in recombinant viruses containing multiple mutant alleles scattered across the genome. Reversions at the site of mutation can be reduced by fixing each engineered mutation with two or more nucleotide changes in the codon.Harvest supernatants by spinning the at \u223c3000 \u00d7g for 10 min at room temperature and aliquoting to fresh 2-ml screw cap tubes.

This is done by plating a serial dilution of supernatants from P0 onto 60-mm dishes of DBT cells and then adding an agar overlay to prevent diffusion of the virus into the medium.One confluent T150 flask of DBT cells is sufficient to seed twenty 60-mm dishes labeled by dilution and virus. Resuspend washed cells in a total of 61 or 81 ml of medium and aliquot 3 or 4 ml of cells onto each of twenty 60-mm plates. Repeat as necessary for the correct number of plates.

This must be accomplished at close to 40\u00b0\u201342\u00b0C as the medium rapidly solidifies below these temperatures and higher temperatures will adversely affect cell viability. Allow the plates to incubate 24\u201348 h at 37\u00b0C.Plaques for ic MHV resemble wt MHV (Fig.\n4A), whereas mutant plaques can vary greatly (Fig.\n4B). Select five plaques for each virus. For each plaque to be picked: use sterile technique to cut \u223c1/3 in. off the end of a P1000 barrier tip, place the tip over the plaque, and push it through the agar, making sure that the surface of the plate and the agar are both manipulated so as to ensure that the entire plaque is extracted without any neighboring plaques. Place the picked medium into 300 \u03bcl PBS and incubate at 4\u00b0C for 30 min.The 300 \u03bcl containing the plaque and PBS is then used to infect a 60-mm plate of DBT cells, brought up as described above. To infect cells, remove the medium and pipette all 300 \u03bcl of the plaque and PBS onto a 60-mm plate of DBT cells, spread evenly by mixing back and forth every 10\u201315 min, and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.

In Figs.\n1C and 5, we selected a glutamate codon at position 13354-56 (CAG) and changed it to an alanine (GTC). To stabilize the mutation against reversion to the wt genotype, we generally alter the codon at multiple positions. This mutation maps to MHV-E as the fragment target, and enzyme BbsI does not cut the sequence or the pCR-XL-Topo vector.Design primers that incorporate the mutation into the target fragment utilizing the nonspecific site of the restriction cut site to engineer a junction oriented such that upon cleavage the restriction site is removed and complementing sticky ends remain (Fig.5).Amplify both fragments by PCR using the newly designed primers along with vector-specific sequencing primers and reaction conditions appropriate for the size of each target. For MHV-E fragment in pCR-XL-Topo M13F and M13R are used.

Wild-type MHV is so efficient at replication that even very low levels of cross-contamination of fragments will result in wild-type MHV out-competing any mutant.For best results use BHK-MHVr cells at or below 80% confluency.Clone stability is enhanced by growing everything at room temperature.Avoid passage of highly attenuated mutant viruses because reversions to wild-type and second-site reversions occur rapidly upon passage.There are several strengths and a few weaknesses to the No See\u2019m infectious clone approach. Strengths over a single full-length clone include: (a) rapid mutagenesis of independent subclones in parallel; (b) mixing and matching of existing mutants from different subclones; (c) increased stability of smaller cDNAs; (d) safety of molecular clone of highly pathogenic viruses; (e) requirement for high individual expertise, which minimizes the chances of harmful use of the coronavirus molecular clone; (f) high recovery of recombinant viruses; (g) speed of recovery of recombinant virus; and (h) reduced sequencing costs (sequence subclone only). Weaknesses include: (a) technical expertise required for assembly; (b) the difficulty of in vitro transcription of full-length coronavirus RNAs; (c) troubleshooting the lengthy assembly process; and (d) obtaining reliable sequence information for the wild-type genome.\n",

            "text": "Well over a hundred mutants have been engineered into the clone of MHV using this approach, which far exceeds the number for all other coronavirus reverse genetic systems reported. Moreover, this technology has been used to rapidly develop reagents in response to newly identified emerging coronaviruses. For example, SARS-CoV was identified in the fall of 2002, and a full-length infectious clone was available the summer of 2003 (16). Piecemeal assembly of smaller subclones is within range of commercial DNA synthesis companies, allowing for synthetic reconstruction of coronavirus genomes. However, attempts to reconstruct other coronavirus genomes using this method have proven more difficult. Current problem areas that must be solved for the advancement of this technology include: (a) unreliable sequence information in the public databases; (b) mistake-prone amplification and cloning of AT-rich genomes (such as in human coronavirus NL63); (c) clone stability and sequence toxicity issues with different viruses; (d) size issues of the different fragments for different viruses; and (e) cell tropism issues with newly identified animal viruses (Bat CoV).",

In SARS-CoV, this approach has identified zoonotic candidate vaccine strains (1\n7,1\n8) and a novel strategy for preventing recombination between wild-type and recombinant viruses by rewiring the viral communication network (1\n9).

The 5\u2032-end is capped and contains a leader sequence (small black box) and the 3\u2032-end has a poly(A) tail. (B) The structural and accessory genes are encoded as a nested set of co-terminal mRNAs, each of which contains the leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032-end of the genome and a poly(A) tail. (C) For assembly of an infectious clone of MHV, the genome was divided into seven stable contiguous cDNA fragments known as MHV-A, MHV-B, MHV-C, MHV-D, MHV-E, MHV-F, and MHV-G. Unique type IIs restriction sites were used to generate unique junctions, which when ligated together produce a full-length cDNA. This allows manipulation of any region of the genome by targeting the fragment of interest and engineering No See\u2019m sites to incorporate the mutation. In this example we target genomic position 13354-56 (indicated by \u2022), which falls within the MHV-E fragment.
