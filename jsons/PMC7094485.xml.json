On the other hand, practitioners can make a significant public health contribution with small changes to their everyday practices. For instance, the addition of routine rapid streptococcal antigen testing on patients with presumptive pharyngitis reduced antibiotic prescriptions by nearly 50% in a pediatric emergency department.2 Patient education and early identification of highly transmissible diseases, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, help to control the spread of disease and overall public health burden. Even seemingly basic symptomatic relief can speed the return to work and school and improve overall productivity.",

Vaccination not only protects the individual but also conveys herd immunity to those not immunized.11 Its effectiveness, however, is contingent on how well the yearly vaccine represents the actual viral strain in the community. The vaccine is composed of components of influenza A and B, but science cannot always predict with 100% accuracy what strains will predominate. In these situations, antiviral therapy plays a more important role.",

This group includes the elderly older than 65 years, pregnant women, children younger than 2 years, and patients with certain comorbid medication conditions such as asthma, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. Patients with severe or progressive cases of influenza requiring hospitalization should also be started on antiviral therapy as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours. Antivirals may be considered for all other patients. Treatment is commenced empirically, without laboratory confirmation of influenza.12 Prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors is recommended for the following patients who have had close contact of a person with suspected or confirmed influenza during the infectious period: persons at high risk for complications of influenza, health care workers and emergency medical personnel, and pregnant women. High-risk vaccinated patients who received vaccine in poor-match years and immunosuppressed patients who have been vaccinated are also good candidates for antiviral prophylaxis.12\n",

Presence of cough was a predictor of a negative streptococcal culture.14 The scoring system of the original Walsh system was complex and has been simplified to give 1 point to the 4 positive predictors and \u22121 point to cough, the only negative predictor. The Centor system similarly consists of 4 criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, and absence of cough. The Centor system has a stronger negative predictive value (81%) than its positive predictive value (48%)15 These clinical prediction rules are helpful for stratifying patients into low, intermediate, and high probability of disease categories, which can guide treatment and the need for further testing.",

The larynx and pharynx lack bicarbonate production and peristalsis, which are protective to the stomach and esophagus. Koufman42 demonstrated that even trace amounts of reflux, 3 times a week, are enough to cause mucosa trauma to the larynx. Recent studies in cell culture have shown that pepsin can damage hypopharyngeal cells in the absence of acid.43\n",
