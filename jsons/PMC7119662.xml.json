            "text": "Purification of virus particles is a standard protocol in virus basic research. The study of virus composition relies on high quality virus preparations free of cellular contaminants. The most widely used protocol for virus purification is centrifugation through continuous sucrose gradients (Fields et al., 1996). This method usually requires large amounts of infected-cell culture supernatants as a starting point, frequently harvested after extensive cytopathic effect. Therefore, contamination of virus preparations with proteins and nucleic acids stuck to the surface of virion particles is common. The purpose of this study is to provide a specific and rapid protocol for obtaining highly pure virus preparations, starting from low amounts (usually less than 5 ml) of infected-cell culture supernatants.",

            "text": "TGEV belongs to the family Coronaviridae that groups important pathogens, causing a variety of diseases including the recently described coronavirus causing the severe and acute respiratory syndrome in humans (SARS-CoV) (Enjuanes et al., 2000a, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). TGEV virions present three structural levels (Fig. 1\n) (Escors et al., 2001b): (i) the envelope, in which the spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins are embedded; (ii) the internal core made of the nucleocapsid and the carboxy-terminus of the M protein; and (iii) the nucleocapsid, consisting of the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and the nucleoprotein (N) (Almazan et al., 2000, Escors et al., 2001a, Penzes et al., 2001). Virus composition and RNA encapsidation have been subjects of interest in our laboratory and virion immunocapture (immunopurification), frequently used as a diagnostic technique (Le Gall-Recule et al., 2001, Nolasco et al., 1993, Plakokefalos et al., 2000, Ptacek et al., 2002, Rimhanen-Finne et al., 2002, Sefc et al., 2000, Sharman et al., 2000, Wetzel et al., 1992), has been a valuable tool. Accordingly, two topologies for the M protein in the envelope of TGEV virions have been characterized using the technique described in this protocol (Escors et al., 2001b). Additionally, by the powerful combination of the specificity of immunopurification with the sensitivity of quantitative real-time RT-PCR, it has been demonstrated that TGEV mRNAs are not encapsidated into virus particles (Escors et al., 2003), in contrast to previous publications using non-homogeneous virus preparations that reported the encapsidation of viral mRNAs within virus particles (Hofmann et al., 1990, Sethna et al., 1989, Sethna et al., 1991, Zhao et al., 1993). Using the same technique the TGEV packaging signal has been located (Escors et al., 2003).",

A well without antibodies was left as a negative control. Immunopurified virions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. TGEV structural proteins S, N and M were detected when the M protein-specific MAb 25.22 was used (Fig. 2B). In contrast, virus proteins were not detected using the N protein-specific MAb 3D.C10, confirming the integrity of TGEV virions, since the N protein is exclusively present inside the virus particle (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). As expected, no virion proteins were detected when the GUS-specific Ab was used, or in the absence of antibodies (Fig. 2B). To confirm the specificity of the assay, genome RNA levels were quantified by real-time RT-PCR.

In this example, the apparent mRNA-N encapsidation efficiencies were high, ranging from 20 to 30% compared to TGEV genome encapsidation in all cases (Table 1\n). The levels of cellular \u03b2-actin mRNA varied from 1 to 8%, indicating that even after sucrose density gradients, all the preparations were contaminated with cellular and viral mRNAs (Table 1). In contrast, after immunopurification very low levels of mRNA-N were detected and \u03b2-actin mRNA was not detected at all (Table 2\n). TGEV virion preparations virtually free of mRNA-N and \u03b2-actin mRNA were obtained when sucrose-gradient-purified virions were used in immunopurifications (Table 2). When partially purified virions recovered at 14 hpi were used for immunopurification, very low levels of contaminating virus mRNA-N (0.8%) were detected (Table 2). These results show that a combination of sucrose gradients and immunopurification provides a high degree of purity. Virus preparations with the highest purification degree are obtained using previously purified virions, or partially purified virions harvested early in infection.",

Specific MAbs can be directly bound to protein A-coated ELISA wells, although some mouse IgG isotypes do not bind protein A efficiently, therefore the capture of specific mouse IgGs by rabbit anti-mouse MAb also avoids this problem.",
