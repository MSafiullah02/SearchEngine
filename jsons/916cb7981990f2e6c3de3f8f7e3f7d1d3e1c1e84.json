We had previously determined the genomic sequence of the pathogenic PRRSV 16244B. Limited comparisons of the structural protein coding sequence of an attenuated vaccine strain have shown 98% homology to the pathogenic 16244B. Here we have confirmed the attenuated phenotype and determined the genomic sequence of that attenuated PRRSV vaccine and compared it to its parental VR-2332 and the 16244B strains. The attenuated vaccine sequence was colinear with that of the strain 16244B sequence containing no gaps and 212 substitutions over 15,374 determined nucleotide sequence. We identified nine amino acid changes distributed in Nsp1\u2424, Nsp2, Nsp10, ORF2, ORF3, ORF5 and ORF6. These changes may provide the molecular bases for the observed attenuated phenotype. * The GenBank accession number for the PRRSV modified live vaccine (complete genome) reported in this paper is AF159149. \u2020 Deceased",

Although attenuated PRRSV vaccines have been in use since 1994, the molecular basis for their reduced pathogenicity remains unclear. Two sequencing studies of the structural protein coding region of the attenuated PRRSV vaccine that has been in use the longest, have been conducted [15, 33] . From these studies, two nucleotides changes in ORF5 and ORF6 respectively were described as possibly influencing the PRRSV virulence [15] . However, no data have been reported on molecular changes which may have occurred elsewhere in the entire genome during the attenuation process and probably involved in loss of PRRSV virulence.",

Preliminary analysis conducted in our laboratory, of the 3 end of the 16244B strain and the attenuated PRRSV vaccine strain referenced above revealed a high genetic identity of 98% (unpublished data). Furthermore the sequence comparison of PRRSV 16244B and the parental strain of the vaccine VR-2332 [19] revealed high identity (unpublished data). Taken together, these observations suggest that as previously reported in other PRRSV field isolates the PRRSV 16244B could be one example of the virulent derivatives of the attenuated PRRSV vaccine that have been recently reported to occur in the field [17] . Therefore, the pathogenic potential of 16244B becomes of interest to characterize. Furthermore, in order to determine which changes may actually be responsible and which not for the reduction of PRRSV virulence we confirmed the in vivo phenotype and determined the nearly entire genomic sequence of the attenuated vaccine strain and compared it to that of its parental VR-2332 (a bonafide pathogenic strain [6] ) and the closely related PRRSV 16244B field isolate.",

The general appearance, signs of respiratory distress, diarrhea and overall body conditions were monitored during this period. Serum samples were collected from sows at 7 days after farrowing for PRRSV antibody detection. Lung and spleen tissue, lymph nodes and serum samples were taken, from piglets born alive and from others, shortly after death, for viral isolation in monolayers of MARC-145 cells.

Animals incoculated with PRRSV 16244B farrowed an average of six live piglets and the rate of survival at 10 days after farrowing was of 29%. Similar results were reported in sows inoculated with the parent of the vaccine PRRSV VR-2332 [6] (Table 2 ). In contrast animals inoculated with the vaccine strain had an average of 13 piglets born alive and the rate of survival at 10 days post farrowing was of 94%. The piglets born alive in the group inoculated with PRRSV 16244B looked weak, unthrifty and feverish. The piglets born from the group inoculated with the attenuated vaccine strain appeared normal. Gross pathology and histopathology studies were performed in all the piglets that died shortly after birth. The results indicated that some piglets in the PRRSV 16244B-inoculated group had mild interstitial pneumonia and a mild vasculitis involving branches of the pulmonary artery was noted in one of these piglets. Infectious virus was isolated from serum samples of these piglets which were also PRRSV positive by IHC performed on samples of their lung tissues. In the PRRSV vaccine-inoculated group, perinatal mortality was unrelated to PRRSV infection (i.e. traumatic as a result of being lied on by the dam). The gross pathology examination of these piglets was normal. Lung tissue samples from these piglets were PRRSV negative by IHC. Infectious virus was isolated from a pool of sera taken at 7 days post farrowing from the healthy piglets born from sow A of the vaccinated group. Attempts to recover infectious virus from the other litters in the vaccinated group were negative. Nevertheless, the median time of gestation to farrowing was similar in both groups of sows. All sows in the experiment except for sow D from the vaccine-inoculated group, developed PRRSV antibodies as indicated by the ELISA positive results. The lack of seroconversion upon intranasal inoculation in one animal coincides with our previous observations that indicate that this PRRSV modified live vaccine, when given by the recommended route, can also fail to induce antibodies as detected by ELISA [20] .",

            "text": "The structural glycoprotein gp5 encoded by ORF5 had two amino acid mutations at positions R 13 Q and R 151 G that were unique for the vaccine strain. The Q 13 is a conservative mutation and is located in the putative signal peptide sequence of the gp5, which is removed after translation. This mutation would change the net charge of the signal peptide probably influencing its function and interfering with the transport of gp5 to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The G 151 change is located in the hydrophilic portion of the glycoprotein. It has been suggested that G 151 identifies the vaccine strain and could be one of the many mutations involved in PRRSV attenuation [31] . Since gp5 is probably involved in binding to cellular receptors and contains the major epitopes for inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses [21] is then plausible that the observed change could alter tissue tropism thus contributing to the attenuated phenotype. A single amino acid change in the rabies virus glycoprotein [9] and in the poliovirus Sabin type3 VP3 [32] is sufficient for the acquisition of an attenuated phenotype. The protein encoded by ORF3 (gp3) had one unique mutation G 83 E which was absent from other North American PRRSV isolates [11, 16] . The change may increase the hydrophilicity of that region of the gp3 possibly affecting the function of the protein that has not yet been determined in PRRSV. However the G 83 E change was also described in three pathogenic Danish isolates from animals suspected to be infected with the vaccine virus [15] . This data suggest that E 83 would be not likely involved in attenuation. Madsen et al. [15] reported the conservative amino acid substitution E 16 Q (ORF6) as possibly influencing virus virulence. We have found the same amino acid substitution in ORF6 of the vaccine and we agree with Madsen et al. [15] that changes at this position could possibly alter the heterodimer (gp5/M) complex formation therefore influencing virus/host or virus/cell interactions. A conservative amino acid substitution was observed in the translation product of PRRSV vaccine ORF2. The function of the PRRSV ORF2 is still unknown. However it has been recently described a novel ORF2a gene in the arterivirus EAV and both ORF2a and ORF2b protein products are required for the production of infectious EAV particles [25] . If PRRSV ORF2 has similar biological functions than EAV ORF2a and ORF2b, then it is plausible to consider that mutations in this ORF could contribute to the PRRSV attenuation phenotype.",

Here Nsp1\u2424 had a change S 331 F that was located 8 residues from the catalytic site. The probable conformational change caused by this mutation may be sufficient to alter the efficiency of the proteolytic cleavage, thus resulting in an attenuated phenotype. Two amino acid mutations unique to the vaccine strain were identified in Nsp2. Nsp2 has been suggested to be involved in species-specific functions [7] . No biological function has yet been identified for this protein in PRRSV but the finding that it contained the majority of the amino acids mutations is consistent with the suggested involvement in host range. It is likely that during the attenuation process through adaptation to MA-104 cell line several mutations took place in the Nsp2 portion of the ORF1a. Thus the attenuated phenotype could be the consequence of the vaccine strain adaptation to MA-104 cell line. However, it has been reported that the EAV Nsp2 acts as a cofactor for the NSP4 protease [29] and its presence was necessary for the major EAV ORF1ab proteolytic pathway [29] . It is then plausible to consider that PRRSV Nsp2 could also be required as a cofactor for PRRSV Nsp4 protease. The observed mutation could then be involved in a mechanism of down regulation of the ORF1ab proteolytic processing. The vaccine ORF1b has a unique mutation Y 952 H in the Nsp10 region of the polyprotein that contains the metal-binding and helicase domains [18, 24] . Substitution of the aromatic residue Y with a tertiary amine (H) would change the shape and the change of this region of the putative protein. Consequently the efficiency of the helicase function could be compromised, which in turn would interfere with the efficiency of virus replication and then contribute to the acquisition of an attenuation phenotype.",

However the vaccine strain was identical to VR-2332 at this position, which suggests that the change may be not responsible for attenuation of PRRSV virulence. We did not determine the complete sequence of the vaccine 5 NCR, but we identified one nucleotide substitution over the 165 bases sequenced. The function of the 5 NCR in PRRSV transcription and replication is not known. However, it has been reported that the coronavirus 5 NCR is involved in regulatory functions in the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs [14] . Although the vaccine strain was identical to the parental strain at this position we cannot rule out the possibility that changes in the 5 NCR might alter the efficiency of subgenomic mRNA transcription in PRRSV.",
