Previous studies (1, 3) were demonstrated that patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and those with influenza virus infection induce different cytokine profiles. Influenza virus infection leads to a rapid proinflammatory reaction, which may condition the infected host for the subsequent virus antigen\u2010specific Th1 defense. While, cytokine profiles of RSV infections in children demonstrate variable results. Infants with RSV infection elicit a predominant Th2 response such as interleukin (IL)\u20104 or IL\u20105 (4, 5). However, it has been shown that in addition to IL\u20104 and IL\u20105, Th1 cytokines such as interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3 are significantly elevated in RSV infection (6). In addition, an in vitro model of respiratory virus infection showed different responses of the cells with infected viruses (7). These results have demonstrated that cytokine responses of the cells infected with different respiratory viruses depend on infectious agents and on the host characteristics.",

In addition, more severely infected patients are associated with less local productions of IFN\u2010\u03b3 (13, 14). Conversely, other studies have shown that levels of both IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20104 are significantly elevated in the nasal secretions of RSV bronchiolitis (6, 15). These data suggest that host\u2010response factors, such as age, atopy or severity of infection, as well as causative viruses are important for determining local cytokine responses. Allergic disease was caused by stimulation of a Th2 response with consequent secretion of cytokines such as IL\u20104 and IL\u20105 (16). Since IL\u20104 stimulates IgE synthesis to induce type 1 hypersensitivity, it is indicated that an allergic mechanism may contribute to the pathogenesis of wheezing in acute bronchiolitis during RSV infection (3).",

IFN\u2010\u03b3 is considered to be a key cytokine in inducing protective responses against viral pathogens (7). We have found that RSV LTRI is associated with the reduced local level of IFN\u2010\u03b3. Owing to the lower IFN\u2010\u03b3 level, patients with RSV infection were most frequently associated with severe bronchiolitis and a longer duration of hospitalization. Although the mean age of patients with RSV infections are significantly lower than that of the other three groups, it is unlikely that the difference in age could affect the difference in the IFN\u2010\u03b3 level between this study groups. We excluded patients younger than three months of age from the study because T\u2010cell mediated responses are delayed during the first 4\u20138 weeks of postnatal age and are accompanied by an impaired capacity to produce IFN\u2010\u03b3 (18).",

Cytokines are partly responsible for chronic sequelae of these infections. Since authors have proposed that adenovirus produces a significantly higher IFN\u2010\u03b3 level and induces a Th1 immune response (7, 20), whereas other authors have shown no difference when compared to RSV (21, 22). In concordance with the study by Fernandez et al. study (20), we observed that the IFN\u2010\u03b3 level was higher in the adenovirus group than in the RSV group. These results indicate that adenovirus and RSV infections in children differ significantly with regard to the magnitude of production of IFN\u2010\u03b3.",

However, the duration of the symptoms before admission was not significantly different between the four study groups. In this study, laboratory diagnoses of LRTI have been made by virus culture instead of PCR. Given that all patients included in the study proven with positive virus culture, it is possible that subject with negative culture might have had a viral infection that was not detected. We were unable to detect any viral etiology other than four kinds of respiratory viruses from NPAs in children recruited for this study. This may be attributed to the limitation of viral cultures in NPA samples, which was not a part of the routine service offered by our hospital virology department. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain significant results from patients with proven viral etiology.",

Children with parainfluenza virus infection and those with adenovirus infection elicited both Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses. These suggest that as seen in NPAs, local inflammatory cytokine responses may differ in children with acute viral respiratory infections according to causative viruses and that a Th2 biased response may be not unique for RSV infection but it seems to be predominant in respiratory viral infections in young children. Investigation of local cytokine responses evolved by common respiratory viruses is essential for understanding of the pathogenesis of distinct respiratory viral infections and development of their proper treatment modalities.",
