Over the last 12 years, studies have suggested several important physiological benefits associated with NAVA, including improved breath synchronization and effective assist that is proportional to neural respiratory drive [2, 3] . Studies have not yet, however, demonstrated improved patient outcomes as was originally suggested [1] , with only two, relatively small trials finding non-statistically significant effects on secondary outcomes [3, 4] .",

Randomized controlled clinical trials are expensive [7] , and poor adherence risks a type II error, with an intervention deemed ineffective when it was actually not delivered with sufficient fidelity [8, 9] . Although good NAVA mode adherence was observed up to 48 h from randomization in a recent efficacy RCT [3] , conflicting results were reported in a subsequent physiological RCT where NAVA failed in 7/20 (35%) participants across the same time period. To date, no trial has investigated adherence to a NAVA trial protocol beyond 48 h or determined the reasons for adherence or lack thereof.",

A lower target level of 8 \u03bcV was set following basic analysis of existing literature and local audit data to avoid over-ventilation and oversedation. NAVA parameters were set by clinicians according to a pragmatic protocol (Additional file 1), which involved matching hypothetical to actual pressure delivery (NAVA preview mode) and a brief period of observation to ensure stability. In the PSV group, ventilation settings were adjusted according to tidal volumes, clinicians were advised to review cycling criteria to optimize synchrony, and participants were otherwise ventilated according to local practice.",

Of the reported reasons for cross-over, human factors such as trial awareness, clinician preference, and lack of NAVA experience were most common, implying low confidence in the application of NAVA and need for further Heart failure, n (%) 25 training. These issues may have been expected in a large group of clinical staff (over 300) despite attempts to embed NAVA technology into unit practice. This finding also highlights the complexity of NAVA and the likely variation in clinical application caused by ICU contexts and human interactions. While the influence of human factors described above may be modified with increased/improved training and changes to study documents, of more concern for trial feasibility is the difficulty in acquiring and maintaining a satisfactory Edi signal, which occurred in 10 out of 36 ( , but do not report on cross-over or its reasons. Recruitment after successful commencement of PSV in the study by Demoule et al. may be relevant. However, the reasons for the disparities between these trials and for the Edi difficulties described remain unclear. Varying levels of clinical expertise across a large staff group may be expected and relevant, but the results may also suggest limitations in NAVA technology (including anatomical abnormalities such as hiatal hernia) and/or a technical complexity in its clinical application over and above those associated with PSV. Notably, both trials were conducted in academic centres; therefore, these issues may be further magnified in non-academic centres with less experience of MV and NAVA.",

            "text": "In contrast to previous studies, the exploratory analysis of ventilation and clinical outcomes found potential benefit in the NAVA arm with increased VFDs to D28, decreased time to breathing without assistance and to alive ICU discharge, and reduced hospital mortality. Acknowledging the low power of these analyses, certain characteristics of our study that are different to previous studies may be relevant to the interpretation of these results. We specifically selected patients with risk factors for prolonged MV [12] and conditions where NAVA has potential physiological benefits [24] [25] [26] . In addition, Edi monitoring was used in the NAVA arm only, meaning the trial assessed the combined effects of monitoring and NAVA. Neural respiratory drive (Edi) monitoring is a potential advantage of NAVA [27] as it may encourage adjustment and improvement of ventilator settings, decrease sedative use, and expedite clinical assessment of weaning readiness. Clinical factors such as renal replacement therapy for example, which differed between the groups, or the lack of an extubation protocol, may also be of relevance to the results. Accepting the need for cautious interpretation, outcomes favouring NAVA are consistent with most published physiological data on NAVA and with trends toward superior clinical outcomes in two previous NAVA RCTs [3, 4] . As such, our findings strengthen the support of a future definitive, adequately powered RCT. In addition to benefits in ventilation and clinical outcomes and despite no difference in sedation dose and RASS during in all MV modes, RASS scores were closer to zero in the NAVA mode compared to the PSV mode (p = 0.020), potentially indicating improved sedation management. Decreases in sedation may be driven by the need to optimise the Edi signal and ensure optimal levels of respiratory drive are present prior to the initiation of NAVA [28, 29] . Improved synchrony and patient comfort when in the NAVA mode may further reduce sedative requirements. Reduced sedation [30] and improved COMFORT scores [31] [32] [33] have been suggested in paediatric trials, but there are limited data available from adult studies. Demoule et al. [3] showed improved dyspnoea at day 1, but no overall difference in adaptation to intensive care environment (ATICE) comfort scores [34] in patients ventilated with NAVA versus PSV. Coisel et al. [35] found no difference in RASS in a small randomized cross-over study in 14 patients ventilated post-operatively. However, while sedation load and RASS outcomes may provide insight into the potential mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of NAVA, the individual clinical relevance and relative clinical value remain unclear.",

            "text": "A key strength of this study is the description of mode adherence and reasons for poor adherence over prolonged durations. The use of a pragmatic protocol ensures that these adherence data are relevant to the real-world application of NAVA. The study successfully recruited patients at risk of prolonged MV, and treatment separation was improved due to the application of Edi monitoring in the NAVA arm only. While early recruitment during acute critical illness allowed assessment of Edi in CMV modes and NAVA from the very start of spontaneous breathing, it also led to the inclusion of some patients who did not commence weaning and potentially increased the rate of short-term NAVA failure during efforts to commence weaning. Despite conducting the trial in four distinct units, the interpretation of the results and the degree to which the results are generalizable is limited due to its relatively small size and conduct at a single institution. As in the Demoule trial, the study site is an academic centre with relatively high levels of MV experience, which may limit the generalisability of results to less experienced centres. Fig. 2 Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of unassisted breathing and live discharge from ICU from randomization to D28. In keeping with previous trials [21, 22] , unassisted breathing is defined as (1) extubated with supplemental oxygen or room air, or (2) open T-tube breathing, or (3) tracheostomy mask breathing, or (4) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) \u2264 5 cm H 2 0 without pressure support and with no return to assisted breathing or death within 48 h. Participants receiving pressure support via non-invasive ventilation or CPAP > 5 cm H 2 O via any medium were defined as receiving assisted ventilation. NAVA = neurally adjusted ventilatory assist; PSV = pressure support ventilation An analysis of ventilator synchronisation was beyond the scope of this study, and the absence of these data may further limit the interpretation of the exploratory outcomes. Improved synchrony in NAVA compared to PSV has, however, long been established [3, 4, 23, 28, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , and dysynchrony is recognised as being associated with worse patient outcomes [42, 43] . As is common to many MV studies, blinding the clinical team was not possible. Outcome assessors and data analyses were also unblinded, although ventilator downloads verified objective outcomes, partially limiting the potential for bias.",
