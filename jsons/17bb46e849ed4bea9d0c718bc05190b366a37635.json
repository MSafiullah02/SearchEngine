Here we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions showed differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses. Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. By transducing cortical neurons with genes that were expressed more highly in granule cell neurons, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1 and Rsad2 (also known as Viperin)) that mediated the antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in granule cell neurons. Thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which probably contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection. npg",

RNA intermediates of virus replication are recognized by pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), which signal specific transcription factors to induce innate defense programs, including type I interferon (IFN) expression and secretion. Binding of IFN to the IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 receptor (Ifnar) on infected and uninfected cells results in a signaling cascade that restricts the infection of many viruses through expression of ISGs. Several studies have reported that type I IFN receptor knockout (Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 ) mice show enhanced mortality after viral infection as a result of increased viral burden and expanded tropism in neurons of the brain 1,2 .",

Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex are differentially permissive for WNV infection in humans 8, 12 . To determine whether these neurons respond uniquely to antiviral cytokines and infectious challenge, we infected granule cell neurons and cortical neuron cultures with WNV in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (Fig. 1) . IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (100 IU ml \u22121 , 24 h) inhibited WNV replication in cortical neurons by 15-fold (P < 0.0001) and reduced infection ~100-fold (P < 0.0001) in granule cell neurons at 24-48 h after infection (Fig. 1a) . We also found a greater responsiveness to IFN-\u03b2 in granule cell neurons compared to cortical neurons when cells were infected with other positive-stranded RNA viruses, including another flavivirus (Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), up to 95-fold), an alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), up to 10,000-fold, P < 0.0001) and a coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), up to 200-fold, P < 0.0005) ( Fig. 1b-d) .

Global gene expression in granule cell neurons and cortical neurons in response to IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment revealed overlapping yet distinct gene signatures (Fig. 2a) . Computational analysis revealed that genes associated with type I IFN induction (PRR, such as TLR and RLR), IFN regulatory factors (for example, Irf1, Irf7 and Irf9) and effector function (for example, Mx1 and Oas) were induced in both granule cell neurons and cortical neurons (Supplementary Table 1 ). We speculated that the two neuronal subtypes might differentially express key host defense genes at the basal level, which could affect responsiveness to IFN and susceptibility to infection. Indeed, the basal expression and IFN-\u03b2-induced expression of genes involved in IFN induction, signaling and effector function were generally higher in granule cell neurons ( Fig. 2b ; P < 0.01) and included Irf7, Stat1, Ifit1 and Oas1 (Supplementary Table 2 ). This pattern, which we confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Supplementary Fig. 3 basal expression yet similarly induced levels of expression after IFN-\u03b2 treatment. Other ISGs (for example, Ccl5 and Cxcl5) showed differences in expression patterns between IFN-\u03b2-treated and WNV-infected cells.

We detected an enrichment of genes with functions associated with immune responses to viral infection. Genes associated with canonical PRR signaling through TLR and RLR pathways (for example, Tlr7, Ddx58 (also called Rig-I) and Ifih1 (also called Mda5)), transcription factors (for example, NfkB, Irf7 and Irf9) and their corresponding target genes (for example, Ccl5 and Tnfa) were expressed at higher levels in granule cell neurons at the basal level (Supplementary Table 2 ). In particular, Stat1 and IFN signaling-dependent genes (for example, Ifit1, Ifit3, Oas and Mx1) were basally expressed in granule cell neurons at higher levels compared to their expression in cortical neurons. In resting or IFN-\u03b2-pretreated granule cell neurons, we found an enrichment of genes that have been linked to antiviral activity (for example, Ifit1, Rsad2, Oas1, Irf7, Bst2 (also called Tetherin), Unc93b1, Ifih1, Ddx58, Mx1, Ikbke (also called Ikk\u03b5) and Stat1), autophagy and inflammation (immune-related GTPases (IRGs), such as Irgm1, Irgm2, Igtp (also called Irgm3), Ifi47 (also called Irg47) and Tgtp1 (also called Irgb6) and leukocyte chemotaxis (Ccl5, Cxcl1, Cxcl10 and Cxcl16) (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2 ). This pattern of gene expression is consistent with results showing that granule cell neurons are less permissive to virus replication at baseline or in the presence of IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment ( Fig. 1a-d) .",

Thus, higher basal expression of host defense genes makes granule cell neurons poised for faster antiviral action in response to IFN-\u03b2 than cortical neurons and ultimately affects the induced expression of ISGs. Notably, the addition of a blocking monoclonal antibody to Ifnar enhanced (~20-fold, P < 0.0001) WNV replication in granule cell neurons yet had little effect in cortical neurons (Fig. 1f) . Therefore, the lower susceptibility of granule cell neurons to viral replication compared to cortical neurons at baseline can probably not be attributed to differences in virus entry but rather to higher expression of genes with an IFN signature, which confer greater responsiveness to the antiviral effects of type I IFN.",

We hypothesized that IFN-\u03b2 would have a greater antiviral effect on WNV-MAD compared to WNV-NY in cortical neurons. Indeed, WNV-MAD infection was restricted to a greater degree (~300-fold at 24 h after infection, P < 0.0001) after IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment of cortical neurons (Fig. 1e) . In comparison, the inhibitory effects of IFN-\u03b2 against both WNV-MAD and WNV-NY were more similar (~80-fold for WNV-MAD compared to ~50-fold for WNV-NY at 24 h after infection, P < 0.0001) in granule cell neurons. These results support the idea that Stat1-dependent signaling proteins are expressed at greater levels basally in granule cell neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5 ) and contribute to the enhanced responsiveness to the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 in this cell type. To establish whether the differential expression of ISGs was caused by Stat1-dependent signaling, we repeated the studies in Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type granule cell neurons. Stat1 \u2212/ \u2212 granule cell neurons showed lower basal expression of several ISGs compared to wild-type granule cell neurons (Supplementary Fig. 6 ).",

We attempted to create a granule cell neuron-like antiviral phenotype by ectopically expressing individual granule cell neuron-specific genes in cortical neurons. Candidate genes included those showing higher expression at the basal level (for example, Irg1, Ifi27, Ifi44, Isg15, Bst2, Rsad2, Ifitm3, Ifi204, Trim30 and Casp12) or greater induction after IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment (for example, Ifit2, Cmpk2 and Lcn2) in granule cell neurons (Supplementary Table 2) . We included Irf1, which was reported as a broad-acting antiviral signaling molecule 15, 16 , as a positive control. We developed a highefficiency (~90%) lentivirus transduction system for ectopic expression of ISGs in primary neurons (Fig. 4a) . We cloned 39 ISGs, transduced them into cortical neurons and assessed their antiviral effects in the absence or presence of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 ( Fig. 4 and data not shown). Three genes (Irg1, Ifi27 and Rsad2) resulted in reduced (5-to 20-fold, P < 0.05) WNV yield when expressed ectopically in cortical neurons (Fig. 4b,c) ; analogously, we also found reduced SLEV infection with expression of these genes (threefold npg to tenfold, P < 0.0001) and reduced WNV-MAD infection (5-to 20-fold, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4f,g) . Ectopic expression of Irg1 (sevenfold, P < 0.0005) and Ifi27 (threefold, P < 0.01) but not Rsad2 (P > 0.05) inhibited MHV infection (Fig. 4h) . Ectopic expression of these three genes (or of any of the other ISGs tested) did not alter cell viability ( Fig. 4d and data not shown) or confer an antiviral effect when tested in parallel against VEEV (Fig. 4e) ; thus, it is unlikely that the antiviral effect with WNV was caused by cellular stress. Moreover, transduction of shRNA against Ifi27, Irg1 or Rsad2 in granule cell neurons correspondingly resulted in enhanced infection by WNV-MAD (approximately tenfold, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4i) .",

To investigate this, we pretreated cortical neurons with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), infected them with WNV and evaluated virus infection. Although treatment with the HDAC inhibitor did not alter cell viability under the conditions tested, it reduced viral yields (fivefold, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5a) and resulted in derepression of ISGs that otherwise had low basal expression levels in cortical neurons (Fig. 5b) .",

One candidate for regulating this phenotype is miRNA-132, which is required for the morphogenesis of cortical and hippocampal neurons, targets p300 and negatively regulates IFN-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling and antiviral immunity [24] [25] [26] . Expression of miRNA-132 is reportedly higher in the cerebral cortex compared to the cerebellum of rats and humans 27, 28 . We found higher expression of miRNA-132 in cortical neurons and the cerebral cortex compared to granule cell neurons and the cerebellum (Fig. 5c) . Moreover, ectopic expression of miRNA-132 in granule cell neurons (Fig. 5d ) decreased the expression of some ISGs (Fig. 5e ) but did not change the expression of non-ISGs (Fig. 5f) . However, there was no change in viral yield when miRNA-132 was expressed ectopically in granule cell neurons (data not shown). We suggest that the distinct antiviral programs observed between granule cell neurons and cortical neurons are explained in part by differences in the epigenetic state of key genes, which may be influenced by the expression of specific miRNAs.",

Granule cell neurons of the contralateral cerebellum were less vulnerable to WNV infection compared to cortical neurons of the contralateral cerebral cortex (Fig. 6b,c) , with less infection in neurons of the granule cell layer even 6 d after infection. Although our primary culture data suggest this phenotype is caused by an inherent resistance of granule cell neurons because of a basal and rapidly activated antiviral program, it also is possible that productive infection of granule cell neurons occurs in vivo during the first few days but is cleared more rapidly. The low level of granule cell neurons infection, however, was not npg caused by inefficient viral spread to the cerebellum, as the adjacent Purkinje cell neurons were infected. In comparison, in the brains of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 mice, we detected comparable amounts of WNV antigen in both cortical neurons and granule cell neurons after i.c. infection (Fig. 6b) .

Our data reveal that genes associated with the host defense pathway are more highly expressed in granule cell neurons at both the basal level and after IFN-\u03b2 treatment. This included a Stat1 and IFN-dependent signaling signature that was expressed in uninfected granule cell neurons at higher levels compared to cortical neurons, which resulted in reduced permissiveness to replication of several neurotropic viruses. Granule cell neurons comprise the largest population of neurons in the brain and account for >90% of neurons in the cerebellum alone 29 . Neuronal injury associated with extensive infection of granule cell neurons might cause defects in motor movement, learning, posture and balance 30 . In addition to our identification of distinct host defense signatures of specific neuronal subtypes, cell-extrinsic effects of resident glial cells also could contribute to innate immune programming of neurons. A recent study demonstrated regional differences in basal chemokine and cytokine secretion by astrocytes grown from the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and spinal cord 31 , although no differences in type I IFN production were reported. Although it is possible that glial cells contribute to the neuron-specific infection pattern observed in vivo, our primary neuron cultures lacked astrocyte contamination, and thus cell-extrinsic regulation cannot explain the differential infectivity and innate gene expression patterns of granule cell neurons and cortical neurons observed in culture.",

Ifi27 was first suggested to have antiviral activity against Sindbis virus infection in mice 32 and may also attenuate infection of hepatitis C virus 33 , although its mechanism of action remains unknown. Irg1 is induced in macrophages and tissues from mice infected with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii or the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes 34 . So far, no antimicrobial functions have been ascribed to this gene, although it associates with the mitochondria, a site of regulation for PRR adaptor molecules and the antiviral signalosome 34, 35 . Ectopic expression of Rsad2 in cortical neurons also showed an antiviral effect against WNV infection, results that are consistent with recent studies in Rsad2 \u2212/\u2212 mice 36 .

            "text": "Why do granule cell neurons of the cerebellum express a higher basal level of host defense genes than cortical neurons? We observed a large number of Stat1-dependent genes that were expressed at higher levels in the basal and induced states in granule cell neurons compared to cortical neurons. Unphosphorylated Stat1 can promote the expression of antiviral genes without IFN-dependent stimulation 43 , and higher basal levels of Stat1 can amplify cell-intrinsic immune responses by activating an amplification loop 44, 45 . Stat1 and its downstream gene targets could be differentially regulated in granule cell neurons and cortical neurons by epigenetic control mechanisms, miRNA-dependent control mechanisms or both. The epigenetic control of ISG expression and its impact on antiviral responses has been reported [17] [18] [19] [20] . Accordingly, treatment of cortical neurons with an HDAC inhibitor reduced WNV yield and resulted in derepression of the expression of ISG at the basal level. One caveat to these studies is that inconsistent ISG expression phenotypes have been observed with HDAC inhibitors 46, 47 , although these differences may reflect variation in cell types or concentration and time of inhibitor incubation. Our experiments also revealed higher expression in cortical neurons compared to granule cell neurons of miRNA-132, which targets the p300 coactivator of Stat1; ectopic expression of miRNA-132 in granule cell neurons decreased the basal expression of ISGs. Distinct antiviral programs observed between granule cell neurons and cortical neurons may be explained by differences in the epigenetic state of key genes, which is influenced by the expression of miRNA. It is intriguing to consider that the basal expression set point of ISGs in different neuronal subtypes may vary among individuals, which could influence the level of infection and spread once encephalitic viruses reach the CNS.",

Cellular levels of 18S ribosomal RNA were quantified in parallel by TaqMan analysis and used for normalization.Lentivirus transduction and functional evaluation of ISGs. Lentiviral constructs encoding individual ISGs were generated by PCR amplification from cDNA generated from granule cell neurons treated with IFN-\u03b2. ISGs were subcloned into the FCIV vector 50 (generous gift from Y. Sasaki, St. Louis, MO). Lentivirus particles were generated, and 3 d after transduction, neurons were infected at an MOI of 1 (WNV-NY and VEEV) or 0.1 (WNV-MAD, SLEV and MHV). One day after infection, cells were stained for WNV antigen with an E protein-specific mAb (WNV E16 (ref. 51)) by flow cytometry, and viral supernatants were harvested and titered by focus-forming or plaque assay.shRNA gene silencing. Lentiviruses encoding shRNA targeting a gene of interest were obtained from the RNAi Core facility at Washington University School of Medicine. Granule cell neurons were transduced with lentivirus particles as described above. shRNA knockdown efficiency was confirmed by qRT-PCR (data not shown). WNV replication in shRNA-transduced cells was evaluated as described above. miRNA experiments. For miRNA detection, total RNA was harvested using a miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, reverse transcribed using miRNA-specific primers and quantified by Taqman microRNA expression assay (Applied Biosystems). sno202 levels were quantified in parallel by TaqMan analysis and used for normalization. For miRNA expression, lentiviruses expressing miR-132 or control miRNA were generated and used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biosettia).QuantiGene Plex 2.0 assay. Brain tissues were harvested from naive mice, and differential RNA expression was quantified by the QuantiGene Plex 2.0 assay (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with 10 1 PFU of WNV by an i.c. route, treated with humanized E16 mAb to prevent spread to visceral organs and euthanized at day 4 after infection. Brains were harvested, cryoprotected or paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with rat antisera against WNV as described elsewhere 52 . Human brain sections were obtained from fatal WNV encephalitis cases (generously provided by B.K. Kleinschmidt-DeMasters (Denver, CO) and C.A. Wiley (Pittsburgh, PA)) and stained with rat antisera against WNV or nonimmune sera as described above.Statistical analyses. Parametric and nonparametric data were analyzed by a two-tailed Student's t test and Mann-Whitney test, respectively, using Prism software (GraphPad Software). Microarray data were analyzed by ANOVA, and the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm was used to control the FDR of multiple testing (Partek Genomic Suite, Partek Incorporated).Additional methods.
