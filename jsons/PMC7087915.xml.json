            "text": "Tobacco (Nicotiana tobaccum L.) is widely grown as a non-food cash crop. As new relevant materials showed, China produced about 1840.5 million kg tobacco leaves in 2005 which amounts to 36.5% of the total output, and China has become the largest producing country in the world [1]. Tobacco leaves are mainly used for making cigarettes, cigars and for chewing. Large quantities of tobacco wastes are generated during processing and cigarette making which amounts to 25% of the total tobacco material, and China also has become the largest producing tobacco wastes country in the world. At the same time, disposal of these wastes is a serious problem nowadays, because tobacco wastes are toxic due to the presence of nicotine, and European Union Regulations (EUR) and Italian law classify tobacco wastes as \u201ctoxic and hazardous wastes\u201d when the nicotine content exceeds 500 mg kg\u22121 dw [2]. However, besides nicotine, there are some other biologically important compounds in tobacco wastes, such as phenolic compounds [3], solanesol [4], transgenic proteins [5], and so on. Recently, the chemical compositions of N. tabacum and tobacco wastes have attracted considerable attentions worldwide [3], and tobacco wastes are considered to be a good source of a large number of bioactive substances. Moreover the report of utilization of solanesol from tobacco wastes [6] let us study the synthetic utilization of their active compounds, but not to degrade or discard them. In view of the potential pharmaceutical application, the identification of phenolic compounds from tobacco wastes is therefore of essential importance.",

Classically, chlorogenic acids (CQAs) are a family of esters and related derivatives formed between certain trans cinnamic acids and (\u2212)-quinic acid (1L-1(OH), 3,4,5-tetrahydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid), the cinnamic acids most commonly encountered are caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic [9, 10]. Compounds in this family possess a wide range of biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, hepatocyte protective, antimutagenic, inhibition of HIV-1 RT and activities against human herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses, anti-SARS and anti-AIV(H5N1) activities [11\u201318]. On the other hand, the tobacco manufacturing process and all the activities which use tobacco often produce tobacco wastes, and of the different solid wastes produced during the process. So, it is difficult to study the composition of CQAs in tobacco wastes. At the same time, profiling the phenolic compounds of tobacco wastes is important to the synthetic utilization of their active compounds.",

In this study, LC\u2013MS was applied to the qualitative profiling of phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and caffeic acid (CA), see Fig. 1) in tobacco wastes.

The results show that the extraction efficiency was highest when 70% methanol were used as solvent, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) was found to be more suitable than heat-reflux extraction (HRE) for the preparation of test samples, the optimal extraction temperature and solid\u2013liquid ratio in UAE were 45 \u00b0C and 1:25, respectively. The extraction yield of mark compounds was obtained almost 70% within 45 min in single-time extraction. Therefore, the optimal preparation method of four components in tobacco wastes were as follows: test samples were extracted with 70% v/v aqueous methanol by using UAE at 45 \u00b0C for 45 min, which process was repeated twice.",

The mobile phase containing acid, which could suppress the ionization of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups was beneficial for good retention and separation of chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic, neochlorogenic and caffeic acids. Different mobile phase compositions (such as CH3OH\u2013H2O\u2013H3PO4, CH3OH\u2013H2O\u2013HOAc, THF\u2013H2O\u2013H3PO4, CH3OH\u2013H2O\u2013HOAc, CH3CN\u2013H2O\u2013H3PO4, CH3CN\u2013H2O\u2013HOAc and CH3CN\u2013NH4 Ac buffer) were attempted to separate the investigated four components. Acetonitrile:ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) (5:95 v/v) was chosen as the eluting solvent system because efficient separation and desired peak shape could be achieved. Under isocratic elution modes, the four compounds could be separated effectively. The effect of temperature on the separation was investigated in the range of 25\u201340 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C was found to be optimal. The most suitable flow rate was found to be 1.0 mL min\u22121. Since their polarity, solubility and other characteristics differ greatly; at least 15 min of elution time were needed for the simultaneous quantification of the four target compounds. On the basis of the UV\u2013VIS spectra of the four components recorded by DAD detection in the range of 190\u2013800 nm, experimental results indicate that four components have the same UV absorption peaks of about 327 nm, so 327 nm was selected for monitoring. Chromatograms of standard mixture (A) and tobacco wastes sample (B) are shown in Fig. 2, peak shape of the four compounds in tobacco wastes were symmetrical. Under the optimized isocratic elution conditions chlorogenic acids and caffeic acid were separated with resolution greater than gradient elusion model. Each component in the samples analyzed was identified by comparing its retention time to that of the respective standard. Retention time for 3-CQA, 5-CQA, 4-CQA and CA were 4.9, 6.2, 7.4 and 11.3 min, respectively (see Fig. 2). Quantification was carried out by integration of the peaks using external standards. As shown in Fig. 2, the LC\u2013UV method was specific for separation of 3-CQA, 5-CQA, 4-CQA and CA in tobacco wastes.\n",

The results shown in Table 1 indicated that the intra- and inter-day RSD values of the four marker compounds were less than 0.2%, which showed good reproducibility. The precision was evaluated using the results of five replicate injections of the standard solutions containing the four components. The results showed a good precision, and RSDs were less than 0.2%. For the stability test, the same sample solution was analyzed at different times within 48 h at room temperature. The RSD values of the peak areas were all lower than 1.0%, suggesting that it is safe to analyze the sample within 2 days.\n",

Similar variation could also be found for the other components. The reason for the variation of the contents can be the difference of plant origin, the effect of environment and some other factors, such as season of collection, drying process and storage conditions, etc. Because variations of the marker compounds may influence the quality and potency of the tobacco wastes, it was necessary to develop an effective qualitative and quantitative method to evaluate the quality of tobacco wastes.
