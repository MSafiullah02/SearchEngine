            "text": "Although there is an extensive body of reports on NET formation in bacterial infections, the way in which bacteria bind to the network strands remains not fully explained. One of the theses claims that the process relies on electrostatic interactions between negatively charged chromatin strands and positively charged surface of bacteria [18]. However, individual Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria are thought to poorly induce neutrophil activation and NET formation [33]. Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) was used to demonstrate that only a larger amount of the bacteria can facilitate neutrophil extracellular trap release [33]. The lack of certain granules in NETs was shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of some acute bacterial infections, since the composition of NETs translates into their efficacy [34]. A low concentration of cathepsin G in mice was found to increase their susceptibility to infection with Gram-positive bacteria which not having adequate levels of neutrophil elastase were more frequently infected with Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or other bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae [4]. DNA was also shown to be a NET microbicidal component and facilitate the killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [35]. The phenomenon was investigated in vivo in mice. After the addition of surplus Mg2+ ions or alkaline phosphatase, DNA had the ability to chelate ions which is pivotal for NET microbicidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The same components also inhibited production of components stabilizing the bacterial membrane and proteins protecting bacteria against NET inactivation. Therefore, DNA was concluded to contribute to antibacterial properties of NET and it also may serve as a signal to elicit host-resistance stategies [35]. Some antibiotics, including clindamycin and amoxicillin, may induce NET release into extracellular environment [36]. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, even though it causes delay in phagosome formation, also induces the formation of NETs [4]. NETs play an important role in systemic infection patients [37] and can affect them in two ways. NETs can use their microbicidal ability to control infection development, catch and destroy pathogens circulating in the blood. On the other hand though, NETs can facilitate tissue and organ damage. Furthermore, NETs degraded by recombinant human DNase promote bacterial infection since mice administered with rhDNase had reduced concentration of free DNA. Unfortunately, it did not alleviate the symptoms. The same study showed that NETs was implicated in systemic tissue damage in severe sepsis [37]. The results were consistent in cystic fibrosis patients whose most effective currently available therapy is rhDNase administration. rhDNase breaks down neutrophil DNA from mucus as the rhDNase can much more quickly digest free DNA than DNA-protein complexes in NET structure [18, 38]. Although the role of NE is observed in the process, its function seems to be ambiguous. On the one hand, NE facilitates sputum dilution through histone degradation and provides access to rhDNases. On the other hand, NE release, similar to other proteolytic proteins, can damage lung tissue and enhance immune response through modulation of proinflammatory factors [18, 38].",

            "text": "It is worth mentioning, that NET may also be understood as a double-edge sword of innate immunity. Some bacteria were demonstrated to use their defense mechanisms that enabled them to avoid getting caught and killed by NETs [39]. One of the mechanisms is molecular mimicry whose objective is to hide molecules of antigenic bacteria to avoid immune response. A bacterial capsule is formed which contains a layer of polysaccharides similar to sialic acid of the host. The bacteria can also modify their surface through changing their charge from cation into anion. This is due to activation of dlt operon in bacterial genome which results in the rest of d-alanine getting bound to LTAs. Consequently, the charge is changed from negative to positive. The mechanism makes it possible to avoid immune response. Positively charged bacterial capsules repel NETs with AMPs [39]. In another defense mechanism used by pathogens to avoid getting caught in NETs, DNase is released. As it can break down DNA, the fundamental block of the network, it causes its degradation and dysfunction [35]. Although DNases are commonly released by Gram-negative bacteria, some cases of Gram-positive bacteria releasing DNases into extracellular environment were also recorded, including GAS \u2013 group A Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae [40]. Streptococcus pneumoniae are caught by the network of NETs and the endA gene encoding endonuclease A is expressed [6]. The presence of endA enzyme was shown to disturb the integrity of neutrophil granulocyte through its stimulation towards elastase release. Interestingly, endA release from Streptococcus pneumoniae in response to NET binding can be a factor of virulence of the bacteria. It is thanks to the enzyme that bacteria can spread further into the lungs and the circulatory system [40].",

It improves bacterial survival and their virulence both in vivo and in vitro [41]. Another bacterial defense mechanism is to trigger an exaggerated immune response as bacteria come into frequent contact with neutrophils, thus enhancing their proinflammatory activity. Group A strep (GAS) bacteria [42] were demonstrated to produce M1 protein, a key component for their virulence. M1 causes NET formation and release while at the same time allows proteins from the network to escape degradation. Escape from neutrophil extracellular traps may also involve blocking the network from forming in neutrophils in the first place [17]. In Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria that produce SpyCEP protease, IL-8 is inactivated and GAS-stimulated NET formation rate is reduced which helps pathogens avoid extracellular killing [17].",

            "text": "NETs can bind and immobilize viruses through electrostatic interactions between virus molecules and the chromatin skeleton of the network [43\u201346]. Additionally, histones present in NETs, rich in positively charged amino acids, can bind virus capsids negatively charged [43]. H3 and H4 histones were shown to aggregate in their structure type A influenza virus while H1 binds some noroviruses [43]. Recent research showed that some NET components, including myeloperoxidase, cathelicidin and \u03b1-defensins, display strong antiviral properties. In particular, \u03b1-defensins show their biocidal activity both in enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [43]. The human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 was found to induce suicidal NETosis recognized by neutrophils mainly through TLR7 and TLR8 (Toll-like Receptors) [46]. The engagement of the receptors causes a cascade of events resulting in the production of ROS, followed by NET formation and destruction of the virus [46]. Interestingly, HIV-1 has developed defense mechanisms against NET. HIV-1 increases IL-10 production by DCs, holding against ROS generation and thus inhibiting NET release [46]. Influenza type A virus is another virus that can induce NETosis. The virus is associated with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) which causes NET formation following activation of epithelial cells of the lungs [47]. Other inducers of NETosis include oxidoreductases active in infection, super-oxidized ions and H2O2, from epithelial cells [43]. Hantaan virus also generates NET release and the cytotoxic properties of the network may exacerbate pathological changes of the organism induced by the virus infection [48]. NET histones generated in Hantaan virus infection facilitate thrombin generation and intravascular coagulation. They increase the permeability of vascular endothelial cells and induce production of antibodies thus exacerbating the pathological condition caused by the virus [48]. NS1 (non-structural protein 1) is the key protein that activates NETosis in Dengue virus infection [49]. The protein activates cells that have not been infected, including endothelial cells, via TLR4. As a result, endothelial cells stimulate neutrophils to form NETs. IL-8 produced by activated endothelial cells facilitates NET.",

Calprotectin [50] was found to be the crucial protein involved in NET degradation of fungi. The fungicidal activity of calprotectin was found in a study on Candida albicans. Chelation of Zn2+ or Mn2+ ions, which are of importance for fungi, reduced their growth [50]. The same study showed that increased concentrations of the ions inhibit NET activity [50]. Furthermore, in vitro observations showed that when calprotectin is exhausted, NET inhibitory activity comes to an end [50]. Mice with calprotectin deficit are not able to prevent C. albicans infection [50]. It was also discussed that neutrophils sense microbe size, and that NET may be the mechanism of response to Candida albicans hyphae, but not to for yeast form [33]. Intriguingly, Branzk et al. [33] claim that NET is not forming in response to small yeast or single bacteria, whereas in different studies [52], it is claimed that hyphae, as well as yeast form can by caught by NET. The hyphae of Candida albicans after coming into contact with activated neutrophils cause histone degradation which affects further chromatin decondensation during NET release [33]. The study by Branzk et al. also shows [33] that selective death of fungus cells in the process of NETosis does not depend on enzymatic activity of the organisms as high temperature-inactivated C. albicans strands initiate NET release to the same extend as alive strands.",

However, NETs are not released when only individual conidia exist in extracellular environment [33]. Bruns et al. [52] demonstrated that strands of A. fumigatus are stronger inducers of NET formation than conidia. This finding can be linked to the presence of RodA hydrophobin. The protein occurs only on conidium surface which makes it immunologically indifferent and thus inhibits NET formation. This finding is consistent with another study [38] that showed that some components of fungal cell walls can trigger NET formation. The study demonstrated that while glucans initiate NET release in a ROS-regulated pathway mannans rely on a ROS-independent route [38].",

NETs may be necessary to control parasites and modulate immune response through their constituent components [54]. Both promastigote and amastigote forms of parasites from the genus Leishmania (L.) are able to initiate NET formation, as was demonstrated by the presence of DNA strands in extracellular environment [54]. LPG found on the surface of promastigota cell form was shown to induce neutrophils into NET release. This is due to the fact that the negative charge on promastigote surface that regulates its binding to NETs can at least in part be also regulated by LPG presence [54]. The promastigote form of L. donovani is capable of NET induction although L. donovani and L. major promastigotes are resistant to NET-regulated killing [54].",

Irregular removal of NETs from the organism causes pathological conditions in the macroorganism. Endogenous DNase may be implicated in the process since their reduced levels disturb successful NET degradation [59]. On the other hand, destruction of DNA skeleton, a NET element, releases antibacterial proteins which can cause massive damage of adjacent tissues [59]. For example, myeloperoxidase released in this way inactivates metalloprotease inhibitors. Consequently, pathological changes caused by the enzymes can occur. Another example is provided by neutrophil elastase release from NET skeleton which can damage barriers formed by the epithelium, e.g. in the lungs [59].",

            "text": "One of the negative effects of NET presence in extracellular environment is that NETs are involved in autoimmune diseases. During NET formation, citrullinated histones and antigens are released into extracellular environment and are presented to immunocompetent cells which in response start producing ANCAs and ANAs [60, 61]. The antibodies usually act against myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3 and neutrophil elastase. As a result, neutrophils get activated and NETs are released [15]. NETs contain autoantigens, including myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3, which become the target of successive antibodies. Thus, an autoactivation loop is created which is the underlying component of autoimmune disease development. Abnormal NET formation, issues with network degradation and lack of equilibrium between the two are the factors initiating or facilitating autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis [59\u201363]. Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes against nuclear antigens, e.g. DNA, histones or RNPs and against ANCAs, in SLE [59]. That leads to a typical feature of the disease, i.e. formation of immune complexes and long-term activation of pDCs [59]. Abnormal removal of cells undergoing apoptosis was recorded in which the release of intracellular autoantigens caused constant production of autoantibodies which is considered to be the key mechanism of the pathogenesis of the disease [59]. The mechanism of its pathophysiology has a role for genes, hormones, environment and abnormal lymphocytes which may affect development of the disease [59]. Having described cell death in NETosis, NETs became the successive and likely sources of autoantigens produced in the disease. Thus, the phenomenon was redefined as one cause of the disease [59]. A link between autoantigen-releasing cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, antibodies, and NETs was demonstrated [64]. Neutrophils primed with type I interferons and exposed to autoantibodies produced NETs [51]. NET components can then activate B lymphocytes via their specific BCRs and TLR-9. Then follows production of autoantibodies against their own DNA and cathelicidin (LL-37) which occur in large amounts in SLE patients [65]. The antibodies can bind DNA and cathelicidin (LL-37) from NETs and form autoantibody-DNA/LL-37 complexes which are recognized by B cells and pDCs and then \u201csustain\u201d autoimmune infections [65]. A correlation between insufficient NET degradation and development of the disease was found in SLE [59]. The serum of SLE patients had reduced ability to degrade NETs. Accordingly, patients could be divided into non-degraders and degraders with higher NET degradation activity [59].",

The serum of RA patients contains a range of autoantibodies, including antifilagrine antibodies, anti-creatinine antibodies and antiperinuclear factors [4, 63]. The serum can be used to obtain fundamental diagnostic parameters, including rheumatoid factor, ACPAs and importantly anti-citrullinated protein antibodies [63]. Proteins that citrullinate during NET formation have increased antigenicity which generates production of their antibodies [53]. Khandpur et al. showed [63] that there is a correlation between NETs and ACPA presence and concentration in the blood. RA serum antibodies were observed to react with NET histones [63]. Therefore, NETs are speculated to display immune properties which can trigger a vicious circle of immune reactions. ACPA-binding NETs in the joint lead to the neutrophil Fc\u03b3 receptor binding to immune complex which further facilitates NET release [63]. A correlation was found between NET formation and systemic inflammatory markers [63]. Khandpur et al. [63] showed that neutrophils taken from RA patients are more prone to form NETs than those from healthy individuals. IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 also derived from the serum are able to induce NETs in RA neutrophils.",

In an in vitro study on CD11b expression, fragments of placenta were able to induce neutrophils into the formation of NETs [70, 71]. Contrary to healthy placenta, the placenta of preeclampsia women had NETs occurring in close contact with trophoblasts [70, 71]. NETs are thus hypothesized to take the space inside trophoblast villi, to reduce vascular blood flow and to finally cause fetal hypoxia [70]. Another mechanism that can result in NET-assisted fetal hypoxia is NETosis facilitated by activated vascular endothelial cells [70]. which eventually destroys endothelial cells of the mother [70, 71]. It is unknown at this point whether NETs trigger pathological changes or the network is caused by some type of deficiency in the placenta [70, 71]. Analysis of levels of free DNA circulating in the mother and the fetus in preeclampsia showed that NETs must have been its origin. The growth of cfDNA (cell-free DNA) inside the fetus can suggest a pathological condition of the placenta [70, 71]. However, a high level of maternal free DNA suggest that its origin lies in NET generation [70, 71]. Research showed that increase of fetal cfDNA levels occurs in early pregnancy, prior to preeclampsia symptoms. However, increased maternal free DNA occurs only once the symptoms develop [64]. Since ROSs are necessary for NET formation and NET release into extracellular environment, some researchers speculate that NETs can contribute to miscarriages caused by maternal antiphospholipid antibodies [71]. Hahn et al. [71] contend that the presence of NETs can be cytotoxic for adjacent tissues, which can have an adverse effect on the fetus.",

The reason behind it was thought to be the ability of neutrophils to bind the spermatozoo and form widespread agglomerates which reduces sperm motility and inhibits its ability to fertilize the egg. Following NET discovery, the ability of sperm to form sperm agglomerates using NETs was investigated [72]. Spermatozoids were shown to activate neutrophils to NET formation and release in a way similar to that in which bacteria activate cells [72]. Since SP (seminal plasma) contains proteins with endonuclease capabilities, similar to DNases - e.g. DNase I, it increases sperm fertility potential in cattle, horses, and pigs through their release from NET agglomerates [72].",

It seems to be not only a very effective defense mechanism used by immune system cells (neutrophils) but also a structure that inevitably requires a \u201cvictim\u201d i.e. NETosis, or cell death. NETs can act like a double-edged sword. The positive effects of NETs in pathogenic infections (bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites) are balanced by their negative effect on the health of mammals, including humans. NETs are observed in non-infectious, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, fertility disorders in humans and animals. More recent reports implicate the role of NET formation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and sterile inflammation.",
