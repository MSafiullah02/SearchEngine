Specifically, the problem to cluster the hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of influenza virus data for the HA gene in dependence on the host and subtype of the virus, and the classification of dengue virus genome data with respect to their four serotypes are studied. A comparison is made with respect to hierarchical and spectral clustering via the kLine algorithm by Fischer and Poland (2004) , respectively, and with respect to the standard compressors bzlip, ppmd, and zlib. Our results are very promising and show that one can obtain an (almost) perfect clustering for all the problems studied.",

How can an algorithm perform well if it is not based on extracting the important features of the data and if we are not allowed to adjust these parameters? As pointed out by Vit\u00e1nyi et al.

Usually birds can pass avian influenza viruses to swines, where the viruses have to mutate so that they can circulate in the swine population. Then a new strain emerges which can be passed to humans or to other hosts. Of course, in order to become pandemic, the viruses may mutate again.",

The genome of dengue virus consists of nucleotides approximately 11 KB long, and 10 viral proteins are encoded in the genome. Dengue virus exhibits extensive genetic diversity, and there exist four antigenically distinct serologic types (1 through 4). It is known that severe cases, called dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome, occur in patients who have secondary infections by a different serotype from previous infections [10] . Around 250,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome are annually reported. Nucleotide sequences of all four dengue virus groups have been determined, and the rapid development of molecular biology over the last two decades is accelerating the accumulation of genomic data on the pathogen.",

It should be noted that the dengue virus genome data are much larger than the influenza virus data, i.e., 10.6 KB versus 1.7 KB. Our hierarchical clustering was perfect for the compressors ppmd, and zlib (see Figure 3 for an example), but not for bzlib. Hierarchically clustering the distance matrix computed via the bzlib compressor gave 11 errors. On the other hand, spectral clustering delivered correct results in all three cases.",
