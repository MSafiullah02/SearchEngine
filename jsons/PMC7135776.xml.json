The influential leadership of William Osler focused the training of health professionals in large, centralized medical centers.2 The release of the Flexner Report3 spurred the standardization of medical education and the formation of various accreditation organizations. Ultimately, all health profession training programs were standardized, with periodic reviews to maintain accreditation status. In addition, advances in technology, basic science research, and medical and surgical interventions took a reductionist view of disease management with an emphasis on highly trained specialists to treat organ-specific diseases. Together, these events formed the foundation for contemporary health professions education with a primary focus on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The role of prevention is rarely emphasized.",
