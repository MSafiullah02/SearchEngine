While manpower for intensive care and medical care is itself less, there is a staggering paucity of mental health care personnel. In countries like India, according to reports from the Indian Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the country needs around 15,000\u201317,000 psychiatrists in order to achieve an ideal ratio of psychiatrists to population which must be 1:6000 to 1:8000. Currently the situation is abysmal with only 6000 psychiatrists (one psychiatrist for over 1.25 lakh people) (Anon, 2020) and the World Mental Health Atlas puts the figure at 0.3 psychiatrists per 1, 00,000 population (World Health Organization, 2015). Even if we keep the population growth rates and attrition rates of Psychiatrists at 0 %, we require 2700 new psychiatrists annually to fill in the gap in the next 10 years for India (Garg et al., 2019). Similar scenario, if not worse, exists in many South Asian and Latin American countries. In view of this pandemic and the resources we need, it is important to train primary care physicians, specialists in other medical services, psychologists, and paramedical team about the essentials of psychological/psychiatric interventions.",

Procuring medications may be difficult in a lockdown due to short supply and relapses in psychiatric illness may occur due to this shortage and a lack of compliance with medication as a result. We may also have to change our prescribing practices in such situations. Many stable ambulatory patients with schizophrenia may be prescribed long acting injectable antipsychotics to maintain antipsychotic levels and reduce withdrawal psychosis as may be seen with abrupt stoppage of antipsychotic drugs. Patients on benzodiazepines may develop withdrawal symptoms causing rebound anxiety and panic with a lack of sleep. The short supply of antidepressants can cause sudden dips in mood due to withdrawal and rebound depression may occur. There would also be instances where patients suffering from bipolar disorder on antiepileptics as a mood stabilizer may get a seizure due to abrupt withdrawal and shifting them to longer acting once a day preparation will be needed. The same holds true for patients of epilepsy on regular treatment (Duan and Zhu, 2020).",

The longer the pandemic lasts, the greater the stress and this would lead to depression, anxiety, uncertainty about the future and days ahead which would cause panic and further anxiousness. There would be a huge surge in mental health issues and psychiatric problems more so after the pandemic ends considering the losses suffered and burden on the people. In LMIC, there are many other factors like small houses, family structure(nuclear families as well as huge joint families), family interpersonal factors and income, salary cuts, loans to be paid, being told to vacate rental premises, excluded from societies and living complexes if having COVID symptoms, that aggravate stress. The psychosocial dynamics is multifold and play a huge role when it comes to planning mental health interventions they need to be taken into consideration (Sood, 2020; Gist and Lubin, 2013).",

The need to sensitize all specialties to the same is a must (Qiu et al., 2020). There may also be cases where patients with psychiatric illness may need treatment if they suffer from COVID symptoms and may not always be cooperative to treatment and care. They must be attended to and their medical needs must be handled if required. The media in LMIC also plays a central role in both perpetuating and fighting stigma and discrimination. Negative media stereotypes of people with mental illness, their families and mental health care professionals are common and hurtful to see. Such portrayals should be protested and correct scientific portrayals must be promoted (Abbey et al., 2011).

In LMIC, there is the problem of age old cultural myths, demonic and supernatural explanations of psychiatric disorders and the need to visit faith healers and places of worship seeking a cure for mental illness. Faith healers are the first care providers for a majority of psychiatric patients and they are rarely referred for psychiatric care. There are instances where care seekers might visit faith healers and may simultaneously seek help from modern and traditional methods of therapy. Direct access to psychiatric services after the onset of illness is not a prominent pathway in LMIC. The reason for the same is magico-religious model of causation of psychiatric disorders and faith in black magic and exorcism (Trivedi and Jilani, 2011). Traditional and religious leaders (not all) may impart wrong impressions about the Covid19, offer diverse therapeutic methods, and ignore social distancing.

There appears to be a disconnect in most governments regarding expressed interest and support for mental health services and the lack of tangible expressions manifested by resource availability and policy implementation (Eaton et al., 2011). The gap between rural and urban mental health services in LMIC will only be merged when the poor knowledge and stigmatizing beliefs among the general population are identified; their willingness to seek help is intensified and during the pandemic healthcare workers must include strategies to change attitudes and help seeking behavior. This can only be achieved by the involvement of people using mental health services and their families along with the community. There shall also be a need to target respected leaders such as village elders, panchayat heads, district health officers and traditional health-care providers along with religious heads in rural areas. The availability of psychiatrists in many rural areas is also a challenge and there is a need to train local doctors there to rise up to the challenge (Hoeft et al., 2018; Maulik et al., 2017).",

Hospitals and many centers have allowed that their non-essential staff stays home which include basic sciences and psychiatry in some quarters but the question of essentiality and non-essential is a personal one that we have to answer. We cannot shy away as we are doctors first and psychiatrists later (De Sousa, 2020). Psychiatrists have to be there for everyone who has fear and uncertainty related to the pandemic, even if they are not infected with COVID. These patients may come to emergency departments and may present with psychiatric symptoms. There may also be admitted inpatients worried about their existing medical problems worsening and can even be admitted psychiatric patients rattled by the current pandemic (Grover, 2011). Consultation-liaison psychiatrists usually traverse through the hospital and multiple specialties system and will be on the frontline in this pandemic. This shall be another challenge for LMIC hospitals to have a large number of psychiatrists in the frontline of healthcare during this pandemic (Greenberg et al., 2020; Tandon, 2020).",

Psychiatric assessments and mental status examinations are best done face to face a video call may not suffice always for the same. Many agencies (private and government) in LMIC have started telepsychiatry services offering free mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. While services are available, there is no stringent regulatory authority to monitor the quality of these services and whether ethical standards are maintained. It is prudent that professionals offering telepsychiatry services well qualified and trained to do the same. The judicious use of telepsychiatry, its maintenance and the appropriate idea of when to refer to a hospital is another challenge faced by LMIC (Corruble, 2020; Knopf, 2020; Rangaswamy Thara, 2013). Legal aspects of telepsychiatry vary nation to nation and the same holds true for prescribing via email or online.",

Guidelines on sensitive reporting of mental health issues like depression, suicide; ECT, child abuse etc. have been produced for the media though they are rarely followed. There is challenge faced by LMIC countries to increase the sensitivity of all forms of media with regard to COVID reporting to reduce anxiety and also to have sensitivity when reporting mental health problems in the eye of the pandemic and lockdowns (Nesseler, 2011).",

Legal and ethical issues are related to each other but are distinct and the domains in which they both develop are often different. The first question would arise on how one would get ethical clearance for their research proposals when most hospitals are battling the pandemics and research committees are probably not meeting. The accountability regarding the safety of the subjects in the study, the nature and protocol and type of intervention as well qualitative data if collected, and research in vulnerable population during a pandemic would then be an ethical dilemma. Ethical guidelines should be modified while conducting research during pandemic settings (Flynn and Speier, 2014; Call et al., 2012).",
