Criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are not specific enough to identify infected patients at risk of worsening to severe sepsis or shock. The objective of this work was to examine the incidence of and variables associated with progression of infected patients to a more severe sepsis stage and to propose a new objective definition of SIRS variables METHODS. Prospective inception cohort of patients (n=3,443) admitted to 28 intensive care units in academic centers throughout Europe during a 1-year period, and having a first infection at admission or during the ICU stay. Main outcomes measured were thirty-day cumulative incidences of severe sepsis or septic shock and hospital mortality RESULTS. The cumulative incidence of progression from infection or sepsis (n=1531 patients) to severe sepsis or shock -accounting for the competitive risk of death without worsening -was 22% at day-14 and 24% at day-30. Twelve variables were independently associated with worsening: temperature (>38.2\u00b0C), heart rate (>120/min), systolic blood pressure (<110 mHg), platelet count (<150.109/L), serum sodium (>145 mMol/L), bilirubin (>30Mol/L), mechanical ventilation, and 5 variables characterizing infection (pneumonia, peritonitis, primary bacteraemia, and infection with gram positive cocci or aerobic gram negative bacilli). The risk of progression from infection to severe sepsis score (RISSC) developed from these variables ranged from 0 to 49, and four classes of risk, ranging from 9% to 55%, were defined CONCLUSION. Using objectively defined criteria for SIRS and impending organ dysfunction should help physicians stratify patients according to their level of risk, to design management strategies or testing new interventions ",

Patients with perforation of the gut with faecal peritonitis and sepsis syndrome usually need intensive care treatment. Antibiotic therapy and supportive care are the cornerstones of treatment. We studied the epidemiology and time-trends in this patient population over four years in our ICU. METHODS. This observational study describes the patients in the ICU, from October 1998 till February 2003, who were treated for perforation of the gut (both upper and lower digestive tract) with abdominal sepsis. The standard antibiotic therapy was piperacillin plus gentamycin and metronidazole before April 2000 and cefotaxime plus ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole plus amfotericin B after April 2000. In addition, since April 2000 selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) was used to prevent secondary endogenous infection. RESULTS. In the study period 78 patients were treated in the ICU for perforated gut. 268 abdominal cultures were obtained in 61 of these 78 patients (of 17 patients the results were not recorded) revealing 69 Enterobacteriacae, 13 Pseudomonas, 2 Acinetobacter, 33 Candida 65 Enterococci, 19 anaerobes and 67 others.

The best single day prognostic markers with high specificity for early identification of SICU patients with SIRS who are at increased risk for sepsis are quantitative expression of CD11b on PMN and plasma IL-10.

The objective of the present study was to compare APACHE II scores and the Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR, the ratio of observed to expected mortality) for all patients admitted to either ICU and HDU, and for those patients transferred from HDU to ICU. HDU to ICU. The patients admitted to the two areas are different and the ICU patients have higher mean APACHE II scores than HDU patients. Patients transferred from HDU to ICU also have high scores. The SMR for ICU is higher than for HDU although the SMR for the pooled data is close to 1.CONCLUSION.In this study, APACHE II underestimates mortality in a unit admitting more severely ill patients and overestimates mortality in the less ill patients admitted to HDU. The high mortality of patients requiring transfer from HDU to ICU is confirmed. The need for caution in using APACHE II to compare outcomes in units with markedly different case mix is reinforced. This may be particularly important for international comparisons.INTRODUCTION.

Strict HR control achieved by continuous perioperative administration of esmolol was associated with an attenuated BNP release, which might reflect reduced myocardial wall stress. The markedly increased BNP concentrations in the control patients could be the result of a temporary ventricular dysfunction, suggesting short-term myocardial ischemia.

Those results were close correlated with the results of the conventional weaning test done 48 h later, in which we used echocardiography (a stable LVEF about 35%, a very significant improvement, LVEF being 18% before the Novacor implant). These results were further confirmed by the patient good general status after the explant of the LVAD.INTRODUCTION.The aim of this study was to compare the effects of continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) on hepatic flow in health subjects compared to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) METHODS. Ten stable copd patients (age: 69.2 +/-6.4 yrs; sex ratio: 2 female, 8 male) and eleven health subjects (age 36.9 +/-8.8; sex ratio: 6 female, 5 male) underwent an echo-doppler examination of hepatic flow before and after the application of cpap. At the baseline and after 10 minutes of 10 cm H 2 O of cpap delivered by face mask we obtain the values of the portal vein blood velocity (PV), hepatic artery (LRI)and splenic artery (SRI)resistivity index. No further oxigen was added to the circuit.RESULTS.At the baseline the mean values in health subjects were: LRI 0.65 +/-0.08; SRI 0.55 +/-0.07; PV 30.9 +/-13.0 m/sec. After cpap there was a significative increase of LRI (0.70 +/-0.08 p 0.49: FEV 1 64.8 +/-4.6%). In the former group we found higher value of LRI (0.75 +/-0.06), compared to health subjects (p<0.05) and mild copd patients (LRI 0.65 +/-0.09;NS) but there were any significative difference for the other baseline parameters. In this gorup, after cpap there was a significative decrease of LRI(0.66 +/-0.09 p CONCLUSION. The results of this studt suggest that in health subjects cpap causes a decrease of venous portal flow and hepatic artery flow.

This lasts 4-9 days requiring continued ventilatory support and is termed intermediate syndrome (IMS) 1 . OPC poisoning results in irreversible blockade of the enzyme acteylcholinesterase(AChE) with excess acetylcholine causing persistent depolarisation of the motor end plate. During IMS, prolonged suppression of AChE could progress to phase II block 2 . However peripheral nerve stimulation using TOF/ Tetanus has failed to show a characteristic fade.

In 2,251 consecutive patients operated on three-vessel coronary artery disease, distribution of cardioplegic volumes (crystalloid cardioplegia, Custodiol TM) was determined. Two groups matched by demographic data (age, weight, sex, body surface area, history of myocardial infarction or previous Afib, NYHA status) and separated by the median cardioplegic volume, were further analyzed for development of Afib in the ICU. Statistical testing used Maentel-Haeuszel Chi-Square, Fisher's exact test and logistic models.",

All nurses questioned welcomed legible prescriptions, easily accessible troubleshooting guidelines and the professional design of the document.CONCLUSION. Improving epidural care, documentation and prescribing practices related in the ICU is complex and time consuming. Our initial results suggest that comprehensive epidural documentation can facilitate safe, streamlined, evidence-based epidural analgesia practice in the ICU. ",

However, there is some inequality as the nurses can only attend the session if the workload on the ICU permits this. Feedback from visiting speakers and participants suggests that there is improved communication between themselves and the ICU staff. In addition, there is some anecdotal evidence that sharing teaching sessions has promoted a greater understanding of the respective roles of the medical and nursing staff and improved teamwork. Interestingly, team working features as a key topic.CONCLUSION. The development of a multi-disciplinary teaching programme does not meet all our educational needs but does go some way towards them. The topics cover a wide range of subjects which can be offered to other staff groups and may be used to develop an outreach facility.
