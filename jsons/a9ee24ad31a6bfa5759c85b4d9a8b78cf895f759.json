While we acknowledge the need to close orthodontic practices during this time, what constitutes an orthodontic emergency has not been specified in the shutdown notice emails. As many orthodontists are struggling to balance their own safety with their commitment to their patients, more concise guidance is needed for handling orthodontic emergencies using circumstance-specific protocols. 2 In general, orthodontic emergencies can arise from the following scenarios: Loose intraoral fixed appliances, either fully retrievable by the patient or parent or partially loose requiring orthodontic intervention; fixed intra-oral appliance impinging on the palate or gingival tissue; broken, ill-fitting, or missing removable appliances, aligners or retainers; a missing or broken bracket; pocky wire; and broken or loose-ended fixed retainer. In addition, there are many scenarios for which an orthodontist may not be able to leave a patient unattended for a period greater than 10-12 weeks. Examples include patients with a reverse-curve NiTi wire or patients having treatment to retrieve an impacted tooth. Public memos about these orthodontic emergencies prepared by provincial (or state) dental regulatory authorities and geared toward patients would be beneficial in communicating a uniform message to our patients.",

Many orthodontists currently do not have the PPE needed to handle orthodontic emergencies, and they also do not have priority to get tested for COVID-19. As such, regulatory authorities are required to help orthodontists order the appropriate PPE and give COVID-19 testing in orthodontists equal importance as that of other medical practitioners so that we can keep our staff and patients safe.",

As the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, many orthodontists across Canada and the US are heading towards implementing virtualised orthodontic consultations and treatment approaches that remove the need for in-person meetings with patients. 4 Orthodontists are contacting patients remotely using different platforms such as Zoom, Invisalign Team, etc; some of which are not HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant. As this is a relatively new method of dental care delivery, clear rules and guidelines should be established regarding its use, to protect both patients and orthodontists equally. Given that dental professionals are currently carrying out these virtual consultations without guidelines, it is concerning that the rapid move towards virtual-based interactions may lower standards of orthodontic care. Here are few important concerns that need to be considered immediately when contacting patients remotely:",
