A phase I clinical trial for salvage use in ARDS in 2001 reported significant improvements in PaO2/FiO2 when systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was given for patients with severe ARDS [7]. The mechanism of this finding is theorized to involve the dissolution of the extensive fibrin burden in the microcirculation and airway spaces in ARDS. There is growing evidence that lethal COVID-19 ARDS is associated with disseminated intravascular fibrin deposition [8, 9]. Consequently, there is revived interest in exploring the role of tPA in reducing ARDS-related mortality for COVID-19 patients who are eligible for salvage use therapeutics. A multicenter group from the USA has proposed that tPA could be an invaluable tool to reduce severe ARDS related to COVID-19 and act as a salvage technique to rescue patients when mechanical ventilation was not available [10]. This investigator cohort has set forward a treatment plan for the impending crisis.",

A long-term randomized clinical trial is not practical in the midst of the current pandemic. However, in our unprecedented setting, a decision analytic Markov model may offer guidance. Markov models use existing published data to project the movement of patients through simulated health states over time [11]. Markov models have previously been used by our group and have been increasingly applied to model healthcare challenges for which trial data may be lacking for the foreseeable future [12\u201315]. As such, a Markov model was created to estimate the impact of salvage use systemic tPA on ARDS/COVID-19 patients in addition to a more aggressive use for interventions at an earlier state of disease progression.",

Furthermore, patients required critical care beds for reduced amounts of time compared to current estimates with utilization of standard methods of ARDS treatment. This model offers hope and support, globally, for the growing number of centers considering salvage use of systemic tPA.",

Although Hardaway et al. demonstrated improvement in the P/F ratio with tPA administration in patients with severe ARDS P/F < 60%, it is not clear whether this effect would be sustained in COVID-19 patients, as tPA would theoretically reduce the sequalae of ARDS, but not lead to improved viral clearance. As such, long-term efficacy is not proven at the current time. Additionally, the model is based on data from the Wuhan experience, a population whose demographics approach but are not identical to those in the USA. Furthermore, in the no TPA arm, transition probabilities for ARDS progress/improvement and associated mortality were assumed to mirror non-COVID-19 diseases\u2014an assumption for which insufficient data exists to validate.",

Italy now has a mortality rate of > 9% with more overall deaths than China [4]. Protocols for salvage use of systemic tPA are in planning at several centers in the USA [10]. If salvage use has efficacy in improving pulmonary function in ARDS related to COVID-19, a quick response to implement a clinical trial would be necessary to generate sufficient evidence for a validated treatment to effectively reduce ARDS-related mortality. At the rate of growth of this pandemic, time is the enemy. Without effective social implementation to curtail the rapid spread of this virus, tPA may never have the opportunity to be used beyond salvage use.",
