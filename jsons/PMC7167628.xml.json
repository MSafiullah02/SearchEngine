Furthermore, plants offer the prospect of supplying immunologically active material orally without the need for extensive downstream processing. Particular interest has focused on the production of antibodies (often termed \u2018plantibodies\u2019 when expressed in plants), and a significant number of antibody and antibody\u2010based derivatives have been produced in a variety of plant species (2002, 2005). Although plant\u2010expressed antibodies specific for proteins from Streptococcus mutans and herpes simplex virus have been shown to be capable of preventing disease when supplied topically (Ma et al., 1998; Zeitlin et al., 1998), there is no report of protection being afforded by the oral route.",

This approach, termed \u2018passive immunization\u2019, is a particularly attractive method for protecting newborn animals against such infections. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus which is an important pathogen that infects both the respiratory and enteric tissues of pigs. In newborn pigs, TGEV causes close to 100% mortality (Enjuanes and van der Zeijst, 1995), and it would be of great benefit if passive immunization could be used to protect such animals. The major antigenic sites of TGEV, involved in the induction of virus\u2010neutralizing antibodies, are located in the globular portion of the spike (S) protein (Gebauer et al., 1991). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6A.C3 has been shown to recognize a highly conserved epitope in the S protein and can neutralize all TGEV isolates tested, as well as TGEV\u2010related coronaviruses infecting pigs, dogs and cats (Su\u00f1e et al., 1990; Gebauer et al., 1991). The recombinant immunoglobulin A (IgA) form of mAb 6A.C3 has been shown to be highly efficient at neutralization when expressed in the milk of transgenic mice (1997, 1998; Sola et al., 1998), raising the possibility of basing passive immunization against TGEV on this molecule.",

Bestagno et al., in preparation). SIPs are derivatives of single\u2010chain antibodies (scFvs), in which the scFv sequence is fused to the constant domain of a heavy chain that is responsible for dimerization (Li et al., 1997; Figure 1a, b). SIPs combine the advantages of the bivalency of full\u2010length antibodies with the small size of scFvs, and have been shown to have higher tissue penetration than complete antibodies and slower clearance than scFvs (Borsi et al., 2002). Thus, they are attractive candidates for passive immunotherapy. In the case of \u025bSIPs, the scFv sequence is fused to the CH4 domain of the S2 subclass of IgE, which permits efficient and stable dimerization via a C\u2010terminal cysteine residue (Batista et al., 1996; Borsi et al., 2002).",

            "text": "If passive immunization against TGEV with mAb 6A.C3 or its derivatives is to become a practical reality, it is essential that large amounts of immunotherapeutic material be produced at low cost. Effective passive immunization through the administration of crude plant extracts requires that the original tissue contains high levels of the appropriate antibody. One way of achieving the necessary levels is through the use of virus\u2010based vectors rather than stable transformation (Porta and Lomonossoff, 2002). In this paper, we report the use of two different plant virus vectors based on potato virus X (PVX) and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) to express an anti\u2010TGEV \u025bSIP molecule in two different plant species. The plant\u2010expressed SIP molecules retain their ability to dimerize, bind to TGEV particles and neutralize TGEV infections in vitro. Extracts from plants expressing high levels of \u025bSIP were able to confer protective immunity in newborn piglets against TGEV infection when supplied orally, thus demonstrating the utility of plant\u2010derived antibodies in providing passive oral immunity.",

For expression from PVX, the sequence of \u025bSIP was inserted, with or without its leader peptide, behind a duplicated coat protein subgenomic promoter to give plasmids pGR106\u2010eSIP and pGR106\u2010eSIPnaked, respectively. To express \u025bSIP using CPMV, the sequence was inserted downstream of a foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A catalytic peptide at the C\u2010terminus of the RNA\u20102\u2010encoded polyprotein to give plasmid pBinP\u2010YP2. The 2A\u2010mediated cleavage reaction is at least 90% efficient and results in the release of a protein with an additional proline residue at its amino terminus. The sequence encoding \u025bSIP was flanked by the leader peptide from the original 6A.C3 scFv at its N\u2010terminus and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (HDEL) at its C\u2010terminus to allow the expressed protein to be directed to, and retained in, the ER.",

(Figure 2a). This material corresponds to the monomeric form of \u025bSIP, which was expected as the leaf material was analysed under reducing conditions. The material ran as a dimer when examined under non\u2010reducing conditions (data not shown). However, no material corresponding to monomeric \u025bSIP was visible by 14 d.p.i., despite detection of the viral coat protein, when an anti\u2010coat protein serum was used to probe the Western blots (Figure 2a). Time\u2010course experiments showed that maximum expression in systemically infected leaves was achieved at 7\u201310 d.p.i., and expression decreased afterwards. The loss of \u025bSIP expression correlated well with the detection of partially deleted sequences observed by PCR at late times post\u2010inoculation. Extracts of leaves infected with PVX\u2010nakedhueSIP, in which no leader peptide was present, did not contain detectable levels of \u025bSIP at either time. The difference in \u025bSIP accumulation in leaves infected with the PVX constructs with and without the leader peptide was not a result of differences in the replication of the viral constructs, as similar levels of coat protein could be detected in all the extracts (Figure 2a).

In contrast with the binding assay, only low levels of neutralization were observed with extracts from wild\u2010type CPMV\u2010infected leaves. The lower levels of neutralization obtained with the PVX samples relative to the CPMV samples are consistent with the significantly lower levels of \u025bSIP expression found in the former.

            "text": "To assess the ability of the plant\u2010expressed \u025bSIP molecules to protect pigs against challenge with TGEV, extracts were made from N. clevelandii or cowpea leaves infected with the constructs showing the highest levels of neutralization (PVX\u2010hueSIP and CPMV\u2010hueSIP, respectively) and from leaves infected with parental vectors. The binding and neutralization activities of the lyophilized extracts were reconfirmed before supplying them to the animals. Lyophilized samples retained 60%\u221270% of the specific neutralizing activity (relative to total protein content) relative to the fresh plant extracts. The loss of neutralizing activity, probably a result of the repeated freeze\u2013thaw treatments, was similar for all samples within one experiment. The lyophilized plant extracts were reconstituted with water, mixed with milk and supplied orally to the piglets, which were simultaneously challenged with TGEV. Previous experiments (M. Bestagno et al., in preparation) have shown that supplying supernatants from mammalian cells containing \u025bSIP molecules simultaneously with a TGEV challenge yields results similar to those achieved when the \u025bSIP\u2010containing extract is supplied prior to challenge. Thus, the observed decrease in virus titre is not a result of virus neutralization prior to administration. As controls piglets were supplied with either \u025bSIP expressed in mammalian cells or the 6A.C3 antibody from which it was derived, or with the corresponding null supernatants. Following further administration of the extracts over a 2\u2010day period, TGEV levels in the lung and gut were determined and expressed as a ratio of the virus titre obtained with antibody\u2010containing extract relative to the equivalent extract without antibody (Figure 4). The results showed that supplying pigs orally with milk containing plant extracts from N. clevelandii or cowpea plants expressing \u025bSIP caused a clear decrease in virus titre in both the gut and lung compared with extracts from leaves infected with the parental virus (Figure 4). This decrease correlated with a decrease in the number of pulmonary lesions observed. The decrease in virus titre obtained with extracts from cowpea leaves infected with CPMV\u2010hueSIP (approximately 104\u2010 and 103\u2010fold in lung and gut, respectively) was significantly greater than that obtained with N. clevelandii leaves infected with PVX\u2010hueSIP (approximately 10 and 102\u2010fold in lung and gut, respectively), and, in gut tissue, was similar to that obtained with the mammalian cell\u2010expressed \u025bSIP (Figure 4). In all cases, the decrease in virus titre with the \u025bSIP\u2010containing extracts was less than that found with the full\u2010length parental mAb 6A.C3. This may reflect the higher level of neutralization found with extracts containing the full\u2010length mAb compared with \u025bSIP (Figure 3), or the fact that the full\u2010length mAb is able to mediate additional mechanisms of protection, such as antibody\u2010dependent cell\u2010dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement\u2010dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which will not be invoked by SIP molecules as they lack the relevant portions of the constant region of the full\u2010length antibody. The difference in in vivo efficacy between the PVX\u2010 and CPMV\u2010expressed \u025bSIP parallels the difference in binding and neutralization activity found in the respective extracts, and is consistent with the lower level of \u025bSIP accumulation in the former case. Thus, the in vitro data on the expression levels provide a good indication of the ability of leaf extracts to confer protection in vivo.",

Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to protect newborn farm animals against TGEV by providing them with milk containing crude extracts of plant tissue expressing SIP molecules. We chose to use the decrease in TGEV titre in gut and lung, the two main target organs for the virus, rather than the clinical symptoms of infection, such as diarrhoea, as a marker for protection, as this is a much more specific assay. Gastroenteritis, although a clinical manifestation of TGEV infections, is a common episode in newborn animals and can result from unrelated infections or even from the artificial feeding protocols necessary for the in vivo experiments. Although virus accumulation was not totally abolished in the in vivo experiments, the virus titres recovered after administration of plant\u2010expressed \u025bSIP (< 104.5) were below the threshold previously shown to be necessary to induce diarrhoea and death in newborn animals. In contrast with diarrhoea, histopathological lesions, such as interstitial pneumonia and atrophy of intestinal villi, are specific signs associated with TGEV infection. Histopathological examination of tissues from piglets treated with the mAb 6A.C3 or cowpea extracts containing \u025bSIP revealed that these signs were absent. In contrast, both signs were evident in animals who received no specific antibody (data not shown). These results indicate that both the parental mAb 6A.C3 and plant\u2010expressed \u025bSIP prevent the appearance of lesions associated with disease. Therefore, the administration of plant\u2010expressed \u025bSIP can be anticipated to afford protection against TGEV. We are therefore convinced that we have established the proof of principle that the protection of mammals against virus infection can be afforded by the oral administration of crude plant extracts containing virus\u2010neutralizing antibody derivatives.",

Furthermore, no toxic effects of the administration of plant extracts containing SIP molecules from either N. clevelandii or cowpea were observed, suggesting that this approach is safe as well as efficacious.

In addition, large amounts of material can be produced in a relatively short time (Porta and Lomonossoff, 2002). Prior to the work reported here, in terms of antibody production, virus\u2010based vectors have mainly been used to express scFvs in plants (McCormick et al., 1999; Ziegler et al., 2000), although there is a single report of the assembly of a full\u2010length antibody using this approach (Verch et al., 1998). The viral vectors used in the current study (PVX and CPMV) were capable of directing the expression of \u025bSIP molecules which had the ability to bind to TGEV, although the expression levels achieved varied. In the case of expression from PVX, inclusion of the original leader peptide from the mouse immunoglobulin VH domain was found to be essential for the accumulation of detectable levels of \u025bSIP. The presence of this leader peptide allows the expressed SIP molecules to be directed to the plant secretory pathway, where post\u2010translational modifications can take place, rather than accumulating in the cytoplasm.",

The \u025bSIP sequence was expressed at the C\u2010terminus of the RNA\u20102\u2010encoded polyprotein, and thus targeting to the secretory pathway should not affect any viral protein. The HDEL sequence was included because retention in the ER enhances the levels of accumulation of single\u2010chain antibodies in plants (Schouten et al., 1996). Furthermore, the presence of this sequence has been shown to be necessary to achieve high levels of expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), which had been directed to the secretory pathway after expression from CPMV (L. Nicholson et al., unpublished data). The strategy was successful, as levels of \u025bSIP sufficient to protect newborn pigs against TGEV accumulated in leaf tissue. The levels of antibody expression (approximately 2% total soluble protein) are similar to those previously reported for an ER\u2010retained version of an scFv expressed from a PVX vector (Ziegler et al., 2000), and considerably higher (about 15\u201320\u2010fold) than the levels obtained when \u025bSIP was expressed from PVX without an ER retention signal. The fact that CPMV infects an edible plant, cowpea, is a further advantage of the system as it reduces potential concerns about administering plant tissue, such as that from Nicotiana species, which contains significant levels of alkaloids.",

It will be very straightforward to express \u025bSIP molecules with different specificities simply by substituting the scFv domain of the construct. In this regard, it is noteworthy that, although the plant tissue expressing the anti\u2010TGEV \u025bSIP was supplied only orally, a significant decrease in virus titre was observed not only in enteric tissue, but also in the lungs. This could be a result of the prevention of virus shedding by the faecal\u2013oral route or, alternatively, may reflect the fact that SIP molecules exhibit high tissue penetration and may therefore prevent the internal distribution of the virus to the respiratory organs. Whatever the reason for this observation, it suggests that the oral administration of SIP molecules may provide passive protection against respiratory as well as enteric pathogens, although further animal studies will be required to establish this unequivocally. Overall, the results presented here indicate that plantibodies are safe and efficacious molecules which can provide immediate protection against virus infections, as required in newborn animals or healthcare workers. Furthermore, their expression via viral vectors allows plant material expressing antibodies with different specificities to be rapidly produced, thus opening up the way to a new approach to control diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other enteric and respiratory pathogens.",
