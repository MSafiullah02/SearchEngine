In most systemic infections, renal involvement is a minor component of the illness, but in some, renal failure may be the presenting feature and the major problem in management. Although individual infectious processes may have a predilection to involve the renal vasculature, glomeruli, interstitium, or collecting systems, a purely anatomic approach to the classification of infectious diseases affecting the kidney is rarely helpful because most infections may involve several different aspects of renal function. In this chapter, a microbiological classification of the organisms affecting the kidney is adopted. Although they are important causes of renal dysfunction in infectious diseases, urinary tract infections and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are not discussed in detail because they are considered separately in \u25b6 Chaps. 47 , \"Renal Involvement in Children with HUS,\" and \u25b6 53, \"Urinary Tract Infections in Children,\" respectively.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 929, "end": 931, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Elucidation of the cause of renal involvement in a child with evidence of infection must be based on a careful consideration of the geographic distribution of infectious diseases in different countries.

The clinical examination should include a careful assessment of the skin and mucous membranes and a search for insect bites, lymphadenopathy, and involvement of other organs.

In several tropical countries, glomerulonephritis (GN) accounts for up to 4 % of pediatric hospital admissions; the incidence in temperate climates is 10-to 100-fold less. This difference might be explained by a complex interaction of several different factors, including nutrition, racial and genetically determined differences in immune responses, and exposure to infectious diseases.

In many conditions, a combination of these mechanisms may be operative. In the assessment of renal complications occurring in infectious diseases, the possibility of druginduced nephrotoxicity caused by antimicrobial therapy should always be considered.

Depending on the severity of the infection and the organism responsible, the renal involvement may vary from insignificant proteinuria to AKI requiring dialysis. The organisms causing AKI as part of systemic sepsis vary with age and geographic location and also differ in normal and immunocompromised children. In the neonatal period, group B streptococci, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes are the organisms usually responsible. In older children, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus account for most of the infections. In people who are immunocompromised, a wide range of bacteria are seen, and, similarly, in tropical countries, other pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella species, and Pseudomonas pseudomallei, must be considered. Vaccines against N. meningitides, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae have reduced the impact of these infections, but their uptake varies in different countries. Systemic sepsis usually presents with nonspecific features: fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and evidence of skin and organ underperfusion. The pathophysiology of renal involvement in systemic sepsis is multifactorial [2, 3] . Hypovolemia with diminished renal perfusion is the earliest event and is a consequence of the increased vascular permeability and loss of plasma from the intravascular space. Hypovolemia commonly coexists with depressed myocardial function because of the myocardial depressant effects of endotoxin or other toxins. The renal vasoconstrictor response to diminished circulating volume and reduced cardiac output further reduces glomerular filtration, and oliguria is thus a consistent and early event in severe sepsis. A number of vasodilator pathways are activated in sepsis, including nitric oxide and the kinin pathways. This may lead to inappropriate dilatation of vascular beds. Vasodilatation of capillary beds leading to warm shock is common in adults with sepsis due to Gram-negative organisms but is less commonly seen in children, in whom intense vasoconstriction is the usual response to sepsis. If renal underperfusion and vasoconstriction are persistent and severe, the reversible prerenal failure is followed by established renal failure with the characteristic features of vasomotor nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 151, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1376, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1379, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Systemic Sepsis and Septic Shock"}, {"text": "Other mechanisms of renal damage in systemic sepsis include direct effects of endotoxin and other toxins on the kidney and release of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other cytokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, and proteolytic enzymes. Leukocyte-endothelial interactions result in physical congestion of the medullary vasculature and further decrease regional blood flow. Nitric oxide (NO) is postulated to play a key role in the pathophysiology of renal failure in sepsis. NO is produced from three cell-specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms. Within the kidney, endothelial NOS (eNOS) is expressed in endothelial cells and plays a role in vascular relaxation, inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation. Endothelial injury in renal ischemia has been reported to impair the production of NO by eNOS. Inducible NOS (iNOS) has been implicated as an important mediator of vasodilatation and is upregulated within the medulla and the glomeruli in sepsis. The alteration of NOS expression and NO production within the systemic circulation and the kidney has supported the extensive testing of NOS inhibitors in sepsis and renal ischemia [4] . Trials of selective NO synthase inhibition did not offer any advantages over saline resuscitation [5] . Activation of coagulation is an important component of the pathophysiology of septic shock and contributes to intraglomerular thrombosis. Tubular injury then leads to cell detachment and intratubular obstruction and tubular backleak. Recovery necessitates the clearance of the necrotic cells and debris as well as the repair of the nonfatally injured cells. Activation of multiple prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic pathways occurs, together with downregulation of antithrombotic mechanisms such as the protein C pathway. Treatment with activated protein C has been shown to improve outcome of adult septic shock, but has not been confirmed to have benefit in pediatric sepsis and may carry a risk of bleeding particularly in infants [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1189, "end": 1192, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1296, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2036, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Systemic Sepsis and Septic Shock"}, {"text": "The renal findings early in septic shock are oliguria, with high urine/plasma urea and creatinine ratios, low urine sodium concentration, and a high urine/plasma osmolarity ratio.

Management is directed at improving renal perfusion and oxygenation. Volume replacement with crystalloid or colloid should be undertaken to optimize preload. Central venous pressure or pulmonary wedge pressure monitoring is essential to guide volume replacement in children in severe shock. The use of low-dose (2-5 pg/kg/min) dopamine to reduce renal vasoconstriction together with administration of inotropic agents such as dobutamine or epinephrine to improve cardiac output may reverse prerenal failure.

Strains causing toxic shock syndrome and invasive disease appear to differ from common isolates of GAS in producing large amounts of pyrogenic toxins that may have superantigenlike activity. Another important mechanism is the production by invasive GAS of an IL8 protease. IL8 serves as a molecular bridge between receptors on neutrophils and the vascular endothelium. Cleavage of this protein prevents neutrophil attachment to the endothelium and results in uncontrolled spread of the bacteria through the tissues [36] . In severe cases, necrotizing fasciitis occurs with extensive destruction of the subcutaneous tissues and is often associated with multiorgan failure. The pathophysiology of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and that of invasive disease is similar in that superantigen toxins that induce release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators play a role in both conditions.
