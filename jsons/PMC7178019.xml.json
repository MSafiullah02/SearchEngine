            "text": "The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) is a 2-year combined training and service fellowship program for health professionals interested in the practice of applied epidemiology [1,2]. The EIS program was established at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by Alexander Langmuir in 1951 to provide formalized epidemiologic support to health departments and training for the future public health workforce [2,3]. Approximately 80 EIS officers (EISOs) are chosen from > 500 applicants each year and assigned to specific positions at CDC headquarters, state or local health departments, or other organizations (i.e., field-based EISOs) [4]. Field-based EISOs directly support the host jurisdiction with investigations of local health problems and in addition, supplement efforts to strengthen the organization\u2019s public health infrastructure. During their fellowship, EISOs participate in applied, competency-based training through both classroom (~5%) and on-the-job (~95%) experience and are required to complete a set of specific core activities, which include the following: participation in a public health-related field investigation; preparation and submission of a conference abstract, brief scientific report (e.g., for CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR]), and manuscript; and presentation to a scientific audience, among others [2,4].",

This assistance is provided in response to formal requests from state, local, federal, and international organizations, and foreign ministries of health (Epi-Aids) [3]. The goal of Epi-Aids is to identify prevention and control measures in response to an urgent outbreak or other public health problem. Epi-Aids are always performed collaboratively with partners, both domestically and internationally, to provide frontline response for investigating disease outbreaks, natural and man-made disasters, and other public health emergencies through use of epidemiologic methods [1,3]. The Epi-Aid team typically consists of at least one EISO not assigned to the inviting jurisdiction, other CDC staff or trainees as needed (e.g., students that participate in the CDC\u2019s Epidemiology Elective), and is supervised by a subject matter expert from CDC headquarters [5]. Since establishment of the EIS program, > 3,500 EISOs have participated in Epi-Aids in the United States and throughout the world [4].",

In certain circumstances, Epi-Aids support investigations of health problems affecting more than one state or jurisdiction (multistate Epi-Aid) or affecting the entire country (nationwide Epi-Aid). Epi-Aid responses are documented by the request for an Epi-Aid (i.e., Epi-1), followed by a report of the investigation [3]. The Epi-1 is a form that contains information regarding the subject and nature of the problem, location, persons and organizations involved, and mission objectives. The Epi-Aid report is a written summary produced after each Epi-Aid investigation and provides scientific feedback to the state or locality where the epidemic or health problem occurred; these reports become CDC records. Although the primary objective of Epi-Aids is identification of prevention and control measures to stop the outbreak or public health problem, Epi-Aid reports and the associated knowledge gained often establish the basis for subsequent scientific literature submitted to peer-reviewed journals and MMWR.",

When necessary, a Google Scholar\u00ae (Google, Incorporated, Mountain View, California) or Scopus\u00ae (Elsevier V.B., Amsterdam, Netherlands) search was conducted to identify the number of citations. To assess the dissemination timeliness of these publications, we calculated the number of days from the Epi-Aid initiation date to publication date; if the exact publication date was unavailable, the 15th day of the specified month was used. MMWRs and manuscripts on the basis of Epi-Aids conducted during the study period and published before June 2015 were included in our study; if both the electronic publication and print dates were available, the earlier date was chosen.",

Infectious disease remains a primary concern to public health agencies with health departments spending approximately $58 million/year preventing infectious diseases [38]. To serve public health needs, CDC has a capable and qualified workforce that can offer expertise during these investigations, with approximately 30% of this workforce located in operational units with subject matter expertise regarding infectious diseases [39]. Nevertheless, CDC has broadened its capability by adding programs in reproductive health, chronic diseases, injuries, environmental health exposure, and other noninfectious conditions [3]. Epi-Aid investigations have evolved similarly and become increasingly focused on the prevention and control of noninfectious diseases. Before 1960, only 8% of Epi-Aids were noninfectious disease-related; this percentage increased to 22% during 2005\u20132014.",

This increase might be attributed to increased visibility of the EIS program and the recognition of Epi-Aids worldwide. Because persons and pathogens travel across borders more freely, we anticipate an increased number of requests for CDC assistance and Epi-Aids with focus on global health concerns; further, we anticipate an increase in the number of investigations involving multiple countries, as demonstrated by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.",

First, because of the high level of scrutiny and extensive peer-review process required before publication, the analyses focused on MMWRs and manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals. Our study did not include abstracts, which although cleared by CDC, are not peer-reviewed and are difficult to compare across different conferences. Second, our study might underestimate the number of publications, particularly for Epi-Aids conducted during 2014. Given that it can take months after journal acceptance for MMWRs and manuscripts to be published, certain Epi-Aids might not have been captured in the analyses or might have been missed if not clearly associated with an Epi-Aid or EISO coauthor. Third, we lacked information regarding the date of Epi-Aid completion, which would be a more accurate way to measure the time necessary for an EISO and collaborators to publish their work on the basis of Epi-Aids. Finally, our study included publications on the basis of Epi-Aids with EISOs as coauthors, which might underestimate the total number of publications available on the basis of Epi-Aids.",

Collectively, Epi-Aids provide knowledge transfer and also offer EISOs an avenue for broader experience and training in epidemiologic methods, communications, and leadership.
