A diagrammatic representation of a biosensor is shown in Figure\n\n1\n, where various components of the biosensor are being depicted. As stated by the new market research, the biosensors market by 2022 is estimated to value USD 27.06 billion and is developing at an annual growth rate of \u22489% between 2017 and 2022.18 This market growth is motivated by the need for quantification and exploitation of the biological species in the field of environmental monitoring,19 clinical analysis for diagnosis of various diseases,20, 21 food quality evaluation,22 drug development23 as well as in defense sector (for the detection of biowarfare agents and nerve gases).24 Biosensors promise to render an economical and robust alternative to some conventional analytical chromatographic strategies for analyzing the chemical species in some complex matrices, thanks to their ability to distinguish the target analyte from interfering and inert biological species without the necessity for separation and subsequent identification of all constituents of the analyte. Usually, biosensors are supposed to be independent of some physical parameters like temperature, pH, pressure, etc. to acquire precise results and the data obtained must be efficiently reproducible and reliable. However, as a result of their highly integrated compact structure, the biosensing devices are at a juncture of distinct areas of knowledge. Biotechnology deals with one of the key components of biosensor, that is, biomolecule, which provides with specificity for the test. The field of chemical physics is linked with the transducing component that converts the biochemical recognition signal to electrical one. Additionally, microelectronic circuits and micro\u2010fabricated structures are associated with small volumes of samples in microliters required to carry out the process at a small scale. And finally, the field of nanotechnology has a significant role in the advancement of biosensor owing to their nanostructure property such as high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and so on. Thus, the field of biosensor is truly a multidisciplinary one.",

Electrochemical entrapment is a one\u2010step method where an appropriate potential is applied to the transducer submerged in an aqueous solution of electropolymerizable monomer and buffer containing biomolecule forming polymer layers integrated with homogenously distributed biomolecules/bio probes.162 Near the vicinity of transducer surface, the biomolecules are incorporated into the growing polymer network by physical means. This simple one\u2010step immobilization technique does not affect the biomolecule activity since there is no chemical reaction involved between the biomolecule and in situ polymerized ICP. This process offers numerous benefits like reproducibility and potentiality of amalgamation of co\u2010enzymes or some another enzyme concurrently by directly embodying them into the solution.163 This well\u2010controlled technique for biomolecule immobilization is greatly significant in the construction of multi\u2010enzyme and micro\u2010sensor. Over conventional procedures, electrochemical entrapment offers numerous advantages such as one\u2010step facile fabrication, accurate control over film thickness, and greater reproducibility, however drawbacks that this procedure provides are possibility of blemishing the biomolecule because of the potential applied while polymerization, poor target approachability due to biomolecule incorporation amid bulk ICP film and the process is suitable only for water\u2010soluble monomer.164, 165 The most commonly used ICP is polypyrrole. Recently, Ganjali et al. constructed a novel and selective biosensor based on electropolymerized polypyrrole for the entrapment of cytochrome C aptamer on a screen printed electrode.

Thus, Hoonacker et al. synthesized a composite of encapsulated gold nanoparticles in water\u2010soluble poly(aniline\u20102\u2010carboxylic acid) via electrostatic adsorption. They proposed the as\u2010synthesized composite for their use in biosensing because the individual counter\u2010parts revealed matching optical characteristics that permitted charge transfer to occur, upon light absorption, between them exhibiting a significant enhancement in photonic reactivity. The composite showed enhanced photonic reactivity toward the environmental stimuli such as redox, pH, or change in refractive index.175 Apart from this, the fact that this composite remained stable in aqueous solution allowed for their development in the field of biological science. One of the fascinating applications of Au\u2010ICP based nanocomposite in DNA sensing is for the detection of the gender of arowana fish (or dragon fish) on\u2010site which is necessary for optimal production of this cultured fish. So, Marugan et al. prepared a kappa\u2010carrageenan\u2010AuNP\u2010polypyrrole based DNA biosensor where they covalently anchored the ssDNA probe of the dragon fish on the composite surface.176 Since polypyrrole has fragile properties,177 kappa\u2010carrageenan was used for developing a mechanically strong ICP composite for biosensing. Genomic DNA samples collected from the scales of fish were subjected to DNA extraction and the resulting biosensor revealed wide response range, good stability, and low detection limit of 5 \u00d7 10\u221218\nm. Mikolaj et al. demonstrated a smooth film of polypyrrole with non\u2010aggregated AuNPs for the detection of DNA. The modification of electrode with this composite layer allowed for the deposition of a higher number of DNA probes (up to two orders of magnitude) in comparison with the traditional thiol self\u2010assembled monolayers.178 De et al. fabricated a platform for biosensing of three different biomolecules viz., glucose, DNA, and protein by immobilizing glucose oxidase, single\u2010stranded DNA, and Lamin A antibody, respectively by using polyaniline nanowire decorated with gold nanoparticles. Method of detection and immobilization for each system was different and the biosensor displayed excellent specificity, higher sensitivity, greater stability, and low detection limit which proved the Au\u2010polyaniline composite suitable as general biosensor platform.179 Recently, Denkbas et al. produced a disposable, stable, and cost\u2010effective biosensor of self\u2010assembled peptide nanotube, AuNP, and polyaniline on pencil graphite electrode for recognizing prostate specific antigen (PSA). They found the detection limit to be 0.68 ng mL\u22121.180 The practicality of the biosensor was also shown by successfully applying the modified biosensor to blood serum samples for detecting PSA. Omidfar et al. fabricated an ultrasensitive sensing platform for detecting E. coli utilizing surface modified screen\u2010printed carbon electrode by first polyaniline film and then AuNP. In the next step, avidin, followed by biotinylated DNA probe was immobilized covalently on the modified electrode by avidin\u2013biotin interaction.181 The described electrochemical assay was found to detect 4*106 to 4 CFU of E. coli and concluded that this geneosensor had potential for accurate and rapid diagnosis of E. coli imposed infections. Au\u2010ICP composites have also been widely used in medical diagnosis for the recognition of destructive cancer cells. Shim et al. designed a novel, facile, and biocompatible aptamer\u2010based nano\u2010biosensor for the detection of non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The authors covalently immobilized MUC1 aptamer probe on the ICP composite synthesized by self\u2010assembly of 4\u2010([2,2\u2032:5\u2032,2\u2033\u2010terthiophen]\u20103\u2032\u2010yl) benzoic acid layer on AuNPs and obtained a detection limit as low as 8 cell mL\u22121.182 In another research, they established an immunosensor for the recognition of hypoxia\u2010inducible factor1 alpha (HIF1\u03b1) tumor by covalently immobilizing anti\u2010HIF1\u03b1 by using the same functionalized ICP with AuNPs and observed a limit of detection 5.35 \u00b1 0.02 pm mL\u22121.183 Another researcher, Wang et al. proposed an electrochemical nanobiosensor for early determination of breast cancer by direct recognition of microRNA\u201021 in clinical samples without extraction or amplification of RNA.

CNTs basically are of two forms: single\u2010walled (SWCNT) and multi\u2010walled (MWCNT) that consists of two or more cylindrical concentric shells of graphite sheets. One of the important attributes is the helicity of honeycomb of carbon in respect to tube axes.194 Also, it is well prominent that the characteristics of CNTs are sensitive to be influenced by their exposure to biomolecules that has led to their exploration as a sensing element for biological sensor.195, 196, 197 Considering their exceptional surface\u2010to\u2010volume ratio, wide electrochemical window, efficient electron transfer, and large specific surface area, they have been renowned as an ideal material for the fabrication of biosensor since it is conceivable to attain ultra\u2010fast detection of biomolecule at very low concentrations.198, 199 Hence, CNT\u2010based biosensors are one of the best contenders for ultra\u2010sensitive sensing methodology. Though CNTs provide with copious benefits, some limitations such as poor processibility hinder their application because of the randomly lying CNTs on the electrode surface that assist in easy peel\u2010off thus depressing the reproducibility of biosensor.200 Thus many methodologies such as multi\u2010functionalization and composite formation with ICPs have been implemented to make CNTs processable and minimize the agglomeration.

Briefly, CNTs exhibit \u03c0\u2010conjugated structure along with a highly hydrophobic surface that allows their interaction with the aromatic ICPs via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 and hydrophobic interactions that form new structures known as composites that can be utilized for biosensing.201, 202\n",

Thus, this drawback can be overcome by the addition of other macromolecule or by the use of polymers.229, 230, 231, 232 Unique attributes of ICP and GR in coalition have attracted the interest of researchers in recent times as a result of the creation of new composite material for its application in next\u2010generation biosensor devices. This GR\u2010based ICP composite provides with biomolecule loading platform and amplify or harness the adsorption, redox reaction, catalytic reaction, and transport behavior of the system. ICPs act as conducting conduits that interact with GR and analytes and enhance sensitivity, selectivity, response time, lower detection limit, and ultimately give rise to extraordinary biosensors as the grafted ICP with GR alters the in\u2010plane characteristics of composite materials.233, 234, 235 As GR\u2010sheets incorporated ICP matrix have poor adhesion between them, numerous approaches have been developed to boost the adhesion characteristics of GR by modifying their structure. Also, there exists chemical inertness of GR that makes it challenging to attain multi\u2010functional and altered hybrid nanomaterials. Thus chemically modified GR such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been developed for multi\u2010functionalization. For instance, covalent immobilization of the biomolecule, defective plane, and rich edge reaction sites contribute to the recognition of target analyte.236, 237 Various composites of GR and chemically modified GR and their applications in various biosensors are shown in Figure\n\n15\n.",

The change in ion flux through the membrane is detected as a change in conductance of membrane.

Since the discovery of glucose biosensor by Clark, research in this field has augmented and never looked back. Of the various materials developed for the construction of biosensor, intrinsically conductive polymers have acquired a considerable interest of scientists and industrialists, thanks to their paramount characteristics such as inimitable electronic structure, biocompatibility, and tunable electrical conductivity. Though they provide with copious attributes, ICPs have stability and property issues in different ambient conditions such as oxygen media, acidic or basic media. Thus, materials such as AuNP, GR and their derivatives, CNTs, and hybrid materials, due to their exceptional attributes, have been amalgamated with ICP to improve the performance characteristics such as rapid response, good selectivity, increased sensitivity, long\u2010term stability, and lower detection limit. Thus, we have meticulously consolidated the existing literature on various composites of ICPs with different materials along with doped conductive polymer based biosensor. Simultaneously, diverse forms of biosensors and the importance of the ICP and their composites for immobilizing the biomolecule have also been highlighted. ICPs along with nanomaterials provide a 3D matrix that preserves the activity of biomolecule and renders excellent platform for immobilization since they offer excellent durability, porosity, selectivity, excellent electron transfer rate, biocompatibility, and better signal transduction. As described previously, various ICP\u2010based composites have been reconnoitered to fabricate unique biosensors that utilize ICP composite as transducer elements, however, the opportunity for extra development is still provided. The clever amalgamation of diverse nanostructured materials with best ICPs will pave the way for utilizing novel ICP composites for manufacturing enhanced sensing platform with superior performance. The major interferences that the biosensor market came across were the inadequacy of availability of mass market thus, from the viewpoint of profit, it causes severe resistance for investors to invest in biosensor technology. Complex fabrication route and mercantile advancement of biosensor technology required for manufacturing many devices can be considered as the limitation for mass production.",
