During ventilation and lung perfusion, the venous and arterial reservoirs were rapidly elevated by 6 cmH2O for 7 min, and the gain in lung weight, which consisted of two phases\u2014rapid weight gain owing to changes in blood volume, and a slower, more prolonged phase of weight gain owing to transcapillary filtration\u2014was recorded. Next, the logarithm of the rate of lung weight gain (\u2206W/\u2206t) was plotted as a function of time. The \u2206W/\u2206t was then analyzed during a 3- to 6-min interval of elevated reservoirs. The initial rate of fluid filtration [(\u2206W/\u2206t)t = 0] was calculated by extrapolating \u2206W/\u2206t at time 0. Finally, we calculated Kfc by dividing \u2206W/\u2206t at time 0 [(\u2206W/\u2206t)t = 0] by changes in pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc), and normalized using the baseline lung wet weight (WW) and expressed in ml min\u22121  mmHg\u22121  100 g\u22121 lung tissue.",

Because glibenclamide, a KATP channel blocker, did not affect the increase in microvascular permeability produced by IR in rat lungs [8] when administered without nicorandil, the activation of KATP channels by nicorandil is likely to have attenuated the increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability after IR. The activation of KATP channels in the lung by administration of cromakalim could help protect against and even reverse the endothelial damage associated with reperfusion injury after ischemia [8]. The protective effect of a KATP channel opener appears to be due to blockade of superoxide anion production by leukocytes or endothelial cells because the opening of the KATP channel inhibited oxygen-derived free radical production by neutrophils [10].",

            "text": "In addition, our results showed that administration of ODQ as a sGC inhibitor before ischemia blocked the salutary effect of nicorandil. Since ODQ has been demonstrated to exert no effect on Kfc with and without IR in the rat lung [11], nicorandil also seems to exert salutary effects on IR lung injury through increasing intracellular cGMP by activating sGC as another mechanism [3]. Based on these considerations, the beneficial effects of nicorandil could be due the activation of the sGC-cGMP pathway. Indeed, nicorandil, because of its chemical structure, is considered a nitrate generator and a NO donor. Since sGC is a NO receptor, several reports have shown that NO donors reduced IR injury through activating sGC [12, 13]. During IR injury, endogenous NO and cGMP levels in tissues or organs were rapidly reduced [14]. In fact, the administration of NO to non-heart beating rat lungs during warm IR was associated with reduced IR injury and increased cGMP levels [13]. IR-induced pulmonary microvascular leak, which requires the activation of sGC, was also attenuated by inhaled NO [11]. Therefore, in the present study, the administration of nicorandil may have increased cGMP levels by the activation of sGC.",

Blood components, especially neutrophils, play an important rule on IR injury. The interaction between neutrophils and endothelial cells releases various proteases and causes cell injury. To exclude these effects and examine nicorandil\u2019s effects on endothelial cells, we used bicarbonate-buffered physiologic salt solution. Second, we did not measure NO generation. Therefore, whether NO generation was involved in the mechanism of nicorandil\u2019s protective effect in our present study remains unclear. However, using ozone chemiluminescence detection methods, nicorandil has been shown not to generate NO [15]. Hence, the administration of nicorandil is likely to increase cGMP because of the direct activation of sGC. Third, the dose of nicorandil used in the present study was higher than the clinical dosage. Yamashita et al. used about tenfold of the clinical nicorandil dose and demonstrated that nicorandil ameliorated the IR injury of a lung allograft in a canine lung transplantation model [5]. In addition, Furuya et al. [17]. demonstrated that 300 \u00b5M of nicorandil improved post-ischemic cardiac function in a rat heart\u2013lung reperfusion model [16]. It is, therefore, possible that rats are less sensible than humans to KATP channels.",
