However, other studies have indicated the absence of any inhibitory effect of anticoagulants in the amplification of CMV DNA (Storch et al., 1994), as well as a lack of difference in results obtained using plasma samples and serum (Boom et al., 1999). These differences from study to study may be the result of the type of Taq DNA polymerase used, the number of leukocytes present in the blood, or the concentration of heparin in the samples (Garc\u00eda and Blanco, 2002).",
