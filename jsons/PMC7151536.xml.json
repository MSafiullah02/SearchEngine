For these efforts, the JNP editors, publisher, and production team are incredibly grateful. We are also thankful for the nursing faculty, many who have had to change their teaching strategies for online environments. Additionally, we want to express appreciation for our authors. We sincerely thank our reviewers, who are still giving generously of their time and expertise to help keep JNP moving forward and providing our readers with current, meaningful content for each issue. Without your continued participation, producing JNP would not be possible.",

Many of us have been working towards goals or events that have been wiped away or indefinitely delayed by the pandemic. Shelter in place, school and business closings, children and spouses at home, and possibly unemployment have been implemented and not by choice. Completion of degrees, graduations, and other celebrations, travel, both professional and personal, have been disappointingly canceled. The inability to be with loved ones in person can be heartbreaking. Helplessness and lack of control can be very anxiety-provoking and challenging to manage.",

Self-compassion has three components: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness.1 Self-compassion starts with mindfulness, accepting what you are experiencing and understanding that every human being suffers and wants to be happy. The sentiments are something we all have in common, especially in difficult times. Being kind to others can extend to yourself.",
