            "text": "The vast majority of preventative viral vaccines consist of an attenuated or inactivated virus, for administration to the individual to provoke a protective immune response. These types of vaccines are very effective, and generally a second administration or the use of adjuvants is not required. Nevertheless, attenuated vaccines in particular present a risk at the level of manufacture or administration since they can in principle revert to a pathogenic form [1], [2], [3]. Newer generation vaccines improve safety by removing whole viruses from the formulation altogether, instead utilizing protein subunits, DNA, or virus-like particles (VLPs) (Fig. 1\n). Subunit vaccines are composed of recombinant viral proteins or purified proteins from the wild-type virus, which act as antigens [4]. DNA vaccination is a technique that consists of the direct administration to the recipient of plasmid DNA encoding an antigenic protein which is expressed by the recipient\u2019s cells, subsequently generating an immune response [5].",

The proteins can be arranged in single, double or triple layers [7]. In the case of human papillomavirus (HPV) [8], the VLPs are formed by a single structural protein that forms the basic capsid of the particle. Other more complex VLPs comprise several structural proteins, e.g. VLPs of the Reoviridae family are formed by 2 to 4 different proteins disposed in several layers [7]. VLPs can also have an external lipid envelope. In this case, the structural protein core exits the cell through a budding process, enveloping the capsid within part of the cell membrane. This is the case for HIV-1 VLPs, which are formed by the Gag polyprotein and take part of the host cell membrane as the envelope [9]. Influenza VLPs are also formed by the protein core and the hemagglutinin spikes that are displayed on its surface [10]. Hence, the choice of the producer cell line is very important since enveloped-VLPs will contain the proteins expressed on its membrane.",

Recently, a porcine circovirus type 2 VLP was developed displaying a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus GP5 epitope B [11]. This opens the possibility of using VLPs as a delivery system. Envelope proteins can act as signals for specific tissue receptors. In this way, VLPs may be targeted to a given tissue, with capsid proteins linked to components for delivery to the targeted tissue. Thus, VLPs have new applications in drug delivery, gene therapy, and cancer treatment [12].",

Production of HPV Type 16 L1 VLPs has been successfully carried out using Lactobacillus casei, where immunofluorescence was used to confirm the presence of conformational epitopes [13]. Conversely, E. coli bacteria were used for the production of recombinant norovirus capsid, which was found to be useful in antigenic and also receptor-binding studies, but not as a vaccine candidate [14].",

Two main insect cell lines are used for recombinant protein production using B/IC expression, Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) and High Five cells (Trichoplusia ni). Many VLP types have been produced using the B/IC system, including Chikungunya, HIV or porcine parvovirus-like particles [18], [19], [20].

Several mammalian cell lines are available for recombinant protein production and are adapted to grow in suspension using serum-free chemically defined media [25]. One of the most extensively utilised is the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. In comparison with other mammalian cell lines, it has the advantage that it is not human-derived and therefore presents a lower risk of contamination by human viruses [26]. CHO cells have already been used for the generation of hantavirus-like particles, which were able to induce a specific immune response in mice [27]. The HEK293 cell line is another widely used mammalian production platform, which has been tested for the production of many different types of VLP, such as rabies, HIV, and influenza [9], [28], [29]. Other human cell lines being evaluated for the production of complex recombinant proteins include CAP-T cells, derived from human amniotic fluid, for HIV-1 VLP production [30].",

The classical method is the generation of a stable cell line in which the gene encoding the protein of interest is integrated. This process starts with the transfection of a cell culture followed by a single clone selection process in which high producers are selected [28]. Up to six months later, a stable cell line can be obtained. Transient transfection is a much faster process. In this case, VLPs can be harvested approximately 48 to 72 h post transfection [9], generating an appreciable quantity of the product of interest within two weeks. This process is suitable when small quantities of different VLPs are needed, such as in initial research phases. It is also useful when the wild-type antigen of interest undergoes frequent mutations, requiring the vaccine to be frequently modified, or when one of the VLP proteins is toxic for the producer cell line.",

Animal-based systems achieve lower production yields: between 0.2 and 18 \u03bcg/ml in the case of B/IC system [39], [40] and between 0.018 and 10 \u03bcg/ml for mammalian cell technology [41], [42].

It is the method most commonly used for VLP production, and has been used for many types of VLP, including HIV [30], Chikungunya virus [18], and Ebola virus [45]. To extend the exponential growth phase, the fed-batch mode can be implemented. Here, small quantities of nutrients or medium are added during the culture to supply the cells with specific components depleted. Fed-batch strategies can be used to reach high cell concentrations.

However, continuous production requires large amounts of medium, which presents difficulties in adapting this method to large-scale production.

In this case, HEK293 cell medium was renewed every 48 h and two retransfection rounds were carried out at Erlenmeyer flask scale [46]. Continuous cultivation has also been used to produce rabies VLPs in HEK293. The HEK293 cell line was made to stably expresses the VLPs in a 5L bioreactor scale [28].",

The core protein of the virus is HBcAg and is coded by the C gene. The enveloped proteins (HBsAg) are coded by the gene S in the viral genome [48].The first HBV vaccines were derived from inactivated HBsAg particles from sera of HBV-positive patients [49]. The development of recombinant DNA technology and safety concerns regarding human plasma-derived vaccines spurred interest in the development of new-generation vaccines. HBsAg was initially produced in E. coli\n[50], but was not secreted and the protein was misfolded. Eukaryotic cell lines were then sought to produce the recombinant protein. Yeast and mammalian cells are the two systems used for the production of the HBV vaccine. Yeast lines stably express the enveloped protein HBsAg, which can self-assemble and is secreted by the yeast cell, resulting in 20 nm size particles similar to those produced by infected human cells. The mammalian CHO cell line has also been used for the production of HBsAg VLPs. These tend to be larger than the ones produced in yeast and are composed of a mixture of glycosylated and non-glycosylated HBsAg, in contrast with yeast VLPs which are composed of only non-glycosylated HBsAg. This difference in size and composition leads to the higher immunogenicity of the particles [51]. This vaccine is also produced by various transgenic plants [35]. Hepatitis E VLP vaccine has also been approved in China under the name of Hecolin. Capsid protein from Hepatitis E is expressed in E. coli and purified. The HEK 293 protein self-assembles into homodimers resulting in the formation of VLPs. A VLP-based Hepatitis C vaccine is also currently in the research stage [52].",

They protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which are both cancer-associated serotypes. Gardasil VLP is produced by S. cerevisiae, and protects against HPV types 6 and 11. The recombinant protein L1 has the ability to self-assemble inside the yeast and form the VLPs. To purify them, a cell disruption process is carried out followed by a series of chemical and physical purification steps. Cervarix is produced by Trichoplusia ni cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the L1 gene. A cell disruption process is followed by several purification steps to obtain the protein. After the purification process, L1 is assembled into VLPs [56]. There are also other HPV VLPs for protection from other HPV types produced in yeast and even in bacteria at a research stage [57].",

Each baculovirus encodes for one gene: HA, NA and matrix protein gene (M1). The co-expression of these three proteins leads to the formation of VLPs that can be harvested from the culture supernatant. These VLPs provide a broader immune response than the inactivated virus or the recombinantly produced hemagglutinin [58].

            "text": "A complete HIV particle measures approximately 80\u2013120 nm. The genome contains 3 major genes: gag, pol and env. Gag encodes the three domains of the capsid of the virion. Specifically, the matrix (MA) subdomain binds to the inner phase of the lipid envelope that surrounds the particle. The capsid (CA) domain forms a conical and more condensed core that contains the viral RNA bound to the nucleocapsid (NC) domain and the viral enzymes. The envelope proteins are encoded by the env gene and are gp120 and gp41, which are placed in the lipid bilayer and displayed on the viral surface. Finally, pol encodes the enzymatic proteins involved in the viral cycle [60]. HIV VLPs have been produced using different expression platforms. Expressed Gag polyprotein has the ability to migrate to the cell membrane, self-assemble, and bud from the cell. HIV VLPs produced by S. cerevisiae have already reached the clinical trial phase. They are composed of the structural proteins p17 and p24 [61], [62]. HEK293, among other mammalian cell lines, have been used for the production of HIV VLPs based on the Gag and/or Env proteins using either transient transfection or the generation of a stable cell line [9], [63]. Insect cell/Baculovirus systems have also been used for the production of Gag-Env VLPs and stable insect cell lines producing the Gag polyprotein have been developed for the expression of these VLPs [64].",

Furthermore, they contain no viral genetic material, which makes them safer for vaccine recipients and operators that are in contact with the vaccine. This is an advantage compared with the classical vaccines, such as live-attenuated and inactivated, as there is no danger of accidental infection. Bacteria and yeast are easy and fast platforms for recombinant protein production, but they lack the ability to produce complex structures and PTMs. This makes them suitable for the production of simple and generally non-enveloped VLPs. The B/IC system has the ability to produce much more complex structures due to its ability to glycosylate recombinant proteins. This system can reach high yields that are comparable with those obtained with bacteria and yeast. Baculovirus design, construction, and cell infection are also relatively straightforward processes, further streamlining production. The main drawback of this platform is the purification step, as enveloped baculoviruses are produced at the same time as VLPs and possess very similar physical and chemical characteristics. For this reason, other baculovirus-free systems using insect cells are currently being investigated. Finally, mammalian cells are most suitable for the production of complex structures. This system faithfully replicates human glycosylation patterns, representing a significant advantage. However, yields obtained with mammalian cell lines are generally much lower compared to other systems.",
