Whereas the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study found that high levels of CMV antibodies correlated with an increased risk of coranary artery disease (CAD) during a 5-year follow-up,7 the Physicians Health Study did not find any association between CMV or HSV antibodies and myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke over a 12-year follow-up period.8 The Cardiovascular Health Study found that antibodies to HSV but not CMV were associated with increased risk of MI and cardiovascular death in elderly patients.9\n",

It is difficult to establish or rule out a diagnosis of C pneumoniae infection by a single MIF titer. Especially in children, acute culture-documented infection can occur without a positive MIF.21 The high prevalence of infection among the adult population also complicates interpretation of MIF results.

Infected leukocytes may disseminate the organism throughout the body with activated macrophages carrying the organism infiltrating the subendothelial layer of the coronary arteries. The organism acts as a stimulus for chronic inflammation, inducing the production of tissue factor, leukocyte adhesion molecules, and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, and interleukins 1, 2, and 6.26 TNF-\u03b1 has been observed to increase the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules34 and inhibit lipoprotein lipase, leading to altered lipid metabolism and accumulation of triglycerides in the bloodstream.35 Increased expression of adhesion molecules promotes leukocyte adherence, migration, and intimal inflammation. These inflammatory cytokines together act to stimulate fibroblast and smooth muscle cell proliferation. They also promote a hypercoagulable state by activating platelets, increasing hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins, and inducing tissue factor release from the endothelium with activation of the coagulation cascade. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide antigen acts as a potent stimulus for macrophage activation.36 In addition, it binds to low-density lipoprotein, which could modify the lipoprotein, making it toxic or immunogenic to endothelial cells, and subsequently lead to foam cell formation.38 Persistent growth of the organism in situ leads to a state of chronic inflammation, platelet activation, vasospasm, and thrombosis.",

These studies varied in a number of ways, including the patient population selected, C pneumoniae seropositivity, the duration of follow-up, the antibiotic used, dosage, and the duration of antibiotic treatment. Patients with stable coronary disease differ from those presenting with an acute coronary syndrome. Patients with unstable plaque may have a higher infective burden or be more likely to have active infection and thus may benefit more directly from antibiotic therapy. Two of the published trials, ROXIS and CLARIFY, involved patients with unstable angina or NQWMI, and both demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events with treatment. The ACADEMIC and WIZARD trials, conducted in patients with relatively stable coronary disease, yielded negative results. One potential explanation for this disparity is that the organism may remain in its inactive nonreplicating form in stable atherosclerotic plaque, making it less susceptible to the effects of antibiotics.",

When interpreting these findings as well as the findings of clinical trials, it is important to consider the limitations of current serological tests, which are unable to distinguish between previous exposure and active persistent endovascular infection. Several studies have shown that positive serology does not necessarily correlate with presence of the organism in atheroma.20 Although serologies may be used as a screening test, we lack a gold standard that is able to confirm the presence of active infection in the vascular wall. In the same way that cholesterol levels can be accurately tested to evaluate for hyperlipidemia as a potential modifiable risk factor, we need a sensitive and standardized means of identifying active endovascular infection. PCR to detect C pneumoniae DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a better marker of persistent infection and measure of the effect of antichlamydial therapy.20, 45\n",

However, the difficulty in culturing the organism in vitro and, as described above, the absence of a surrogate marker of active infection pose a diagnostic challenge to determine the presence of an active endovascular infection. Data from animal models provide support for Koch's third postulate as inoculation of the organism into a healthy host has been observed to cause atherosclerotic disease or increase the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in those with preexisting disease. In these same animal studies, after inoculation with the organism, the presence of C pneumoniae in the vessel walls has been confirmed (Koch's fourth postulate.)",

A positive clinical trial would provide additional evidence in favor of a causal relationship, whereas a negative trial would suggest the opposite. However, results from current antibiotic clinical trials are inconclusive, and the effectiveness of therapy may vary between different subsets of patients as seen in the ROXIS and CLARIFY studies compared with the ACADEMIC and WIZARD trials. Patients who present with acute coronary syndrome may derive more direct benefit from antibiotic therapy than those with stable coronary disease. Active chlamydial infection may be involved in plaque rupture, and antibiotics may be an important initial therapy in those presenting with acute coronary syndrome in the same way that aspirin, antiplatelet agents, \u03b2-blockers, and statins are used. The results of the PROVE-IT and ACES trials and other ongoing large-scale clinical trials (Table 3) will be important in clarifying the potential role for antibiotics in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome and coronary disease, respectively.46\n",
