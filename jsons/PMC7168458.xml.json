Because the cell treatment was for a short period, it was possible that we could use higher concentrations of the compounds. To verify this, we treated cells for 15 minutes with different concentrations of the compounds (up to 100 nM), after which we washed the cells twice with DMEM before incubating them under standard conditions for 24 hrs and assessing cell viability as undertaken previously. We found no evident loss of cell viability, even at the highest concentration used (100 nM; Supplementary Fig. 7).

We found a significant reduction in both infection and virus production under all conditions tested (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S8).

We found a marked reduction in colocalization between CHIKV and PHB when we incubated the virus with cells in the presence of the compounds at 100 nM, as compared to incubation with no compound (Fig. 6). The high degree of colocalization between CHIKV and PHB (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.85, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.88) was reduced to a statistically significantly degree in the presence of FL3 (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.22; 95% CI 0.09\u20130.34; P<0.05) and FL23 (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.63; 95% CI 0.53\u20130.73; P<0.05) and reduced, although not significantly, in the presence of sulfonyl amidine 1 m (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.72; 95% CI 0.34\u20131.09) These results confirm that the ligands interfere with the receptor binding of CHIKV.",

Flavaglines are a family of natural products found in plants of the genus Aglaia, family Meliaceae (mahogany), of which the first identified molecule was rocaglamide 48. Rocaglamide was first identified based on its potent anti\u2010leukemic activity; since then both natural and synthetic flavaglines have been shown to have potent anti\u2010cancer properties, often in the low nanomolar range 34, 35. Recent studies have suggested that flavaglines, including rocaglamide and silvestrol, are promising candidates for the treatment of leukemia 49. Studies have shown that the anti\u2010cancer action of flavaglines derives, at least in part, from a specific interaction between PHB and flavaglines 36. This study was undertaken to determine whether the interaction between flavaglines and PHB was sufficient to disrupt the interaction between PHB and CHIKV. All of our results are consistent with the compounds acting at the entry stage, possibly by physically interfering with the binding of CHIKV to the PHB receptor. The maximum inhibition observed was approximately 50% of viral entry (seen with pulse treatment of cells with FL3), a degree of inhibition consistent with that seen in previous antibody inhibition experiments 20. The compounds tested showed little effect when added post\u2010entry; while this may suggest that flavaglines have only limited potential utility as prophylactic agents, because natural infections are not synchronous, administration during the course of the disease could have therapeutic effects by preventing new cells from becoming infected. The fact that both antibody inhibition experiments 20 and the compounds tested here showed a maximum effect on entry of about 50% may indicate that CHIKV uses multiple receptor protein to enter susceptible cells.",

Importantly, these compounds show no toxicity to normal cells and do not display any evidence of toxicity in vivo\n33, suggesting that these compounds, or indeed other ligands of PHB, could form the basis of a prophylactic or therapeutic regime in CHIKV outbreaks.",
