Early in the course of the disease, airway inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity, and loss of lung function are evident. Atopy and a family history of asthma are strongly correlated with asthma in childhood. Exposure to allergens activates mast cells and promotes inflammation and infiltration of the airway with neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes.8 Whatever the cause, the inflammation results in airway hyperresponsiveness, which causes bronchoconstriction, edema, and mucous plugging, all of which contribute to bronchial obstruction. Chronically, collagen deposition below the epithelial basement membrane results in narrowing of the airway secondary to remodeling",

Paradoxical motion of the thoracoabdominal wall (i.e., expansion of abdominal girth with inspiration) is another useful sign of increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest frequently reveals wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. Rales or crackles are often heard and may shift in location over a period of minutes to hours (\u201cmigratory atelectasis\u201d). Assessment of air movement is determined by the loudness of breath sounds in various areas of the chest and may also vary over time. Patients with poor air movement may have minimal wheezing because the passage of air through the airway is what generates wheezing sounds. As air exchange improves, wheezing may become more pronounced. Conversely, patients with a deteriorating clinical course may have diminishing wheezing indicative of worsening air movement and perhaps respiratory insufficiency. Agitation and somnolence are worrisome signs and may indicate hypoxemia or hypercapnia with impending respiratory failure.",

The cough is exaggerated by stress or attention to the cough and disappears with sleep.20 These features help distinguish this entity from cough-variant asthma.

Patients in severe distress are working hard to breathe, with inspiratory and expiratory wheezing, and are often hypoxic. Signs of impending respiratory failure are provided in Table 75-4\n. For infants and children younger than 5 years of age, clues to breathlessness include difficulty or reluctance to feed and changes in crying pattern (e.g., softer or shorter). Changes in vital signs in these younger patients must be interpreted in the context of normal values for the age range. Interestingly, paradoxical thoracoabdominal movement, a sign associated with severe respiratory distress in older children, may be seen in young children and infants, even in states of mild or moderate respiratory distress.",

Spirometric indices such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) are most useful to assess the severity of asthma. However, because spirometry is often not readily available in the acute care setting, PEFR can be used instead. The hand-held peak flowmeter measures PEFR, and normal values have been established according to age, gender, and height23 (Table 75-5\n). PEFR provides a measure of large-airway flow by measuring the rate of airflow in liters per minute. As a flare or asthma exacerbation worsens, PEFR typically becomes lower than baseline and may reflect the severity of the exacerbation. In patients presenting to an emergency room with an asthma exacerbation, FEV1 is typically 30% to 35% of normal24 and PEFR is less than 50% of normal. Monitoring PEFR can also assist in tapering medication during the recovery phase of an acute hospitalization. PEFR is effort and technique dependent, and therefore reliability remains a concern. It should be used in conjunction with other parameters of severity for assessment of patients (see Chapter 80).",

In general, steroids lead to down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids also activate histone deacetylase, which inhibits DNA transcription.43 This change in transcription leads to increased expression of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor and decreases in airway inflammation and mucus secretion. It can take several hours to reverse airway inflammation, and benefits are typically seen within 4 hours after the administration of corticosteroids.38, 39, 44 Studies comparing oral and intravenous corticosteroids have found no significant differences in efficacy.45, 46 Oral steroids are typically preferred because intravenous access is not required.45, 47 Suggested dosing of corticosteroids is provided in Table 75-8\n.",

In general, an isolated exacerbation is treated with oral corticosteroids for 5 days. However, if a patient was admitted to the hospital for an extended period, a prolonged course of corticosteroids will be required, followed by tapering doses. A taper is prescribed to prevent relapse of symptoms, as well as to prevent an addisonian crisis from adrenal suppression. The risk for an addisonian crisis is hypothetical and has not been demonstrated in any study.72, 73, 74 In addition, patients receiving their second course of steroids in a month should undergo prolonged tapering as well. A typical taper involves keeping the patient at a full daily dose of corticosteroids until stable clinical status is achieved and then decreasing the dose by 30% to 50% daily. Patients who required admission to the hospital may not have been on an adequate treatment plan. Thus, hospitalization offers an opportunity to assess the overall treatment regimen.

Supportive care includes supplemental oxygen if needed and maintenance of hydration.\u2022Many of the pharmacologic agents have significant side effects, and therefore appropriate monitoring is required.\u2022\nPatients with severe symptoms or those with moderately severe symptoms that fail to improve after initial therapy are candidates for admission to an intensive care setting.\u2022At the time of discharge, patients should have a clear plan for ongoing treatment of the acute exacerbation and transition to maintenance therapy. In addition, an action plan for subsequent exacerbations should be in place.\n\n",

Drugs that modify the immune response are currently under active investigation. An example of one of these drugs is omalizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-IgE antibody. This drug binds circulating free IgE and consequently reduces the level of free IgE in the bloodstream and prevents it from binding to mast cell membrane receptors, thus curtailing the early and late asthmatic responses. Omalizumab has been found to reduce symptoms, exacerbations,92 and the use of corticosteroids.\u2022New NHLBI Expert Panel guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of asthma are expected in late 2006 or early 2007. The new guidelines are expected to emphasize daily symptom control in addition to preventing exacerbations in the management of asthma.\n\n",
