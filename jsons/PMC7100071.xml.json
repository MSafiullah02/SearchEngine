Oxidative stress occurs when this balance is disrupted by excessive production of oxidative agents and/or by overcoming antioxidant defense mechanisms. ROS and RNS are major mediators of cellular injury via peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids from biomembranes and subcellular organelles. Breakdown products of lipid peroxides, mostly reactive aldehydes, may serve as oxidative second messengers due to their prolonged half-life and ability to diffuse from their site of formation, compared to free radicals. Lipid breakdown products can also make covalent modifications on nucleic acids and proteins and dramatically alter cell integrity [4]. Among other effects, peroxidation of membrane lipids represents a major threat to cellular integrity, once protein oxidation can alter metabolic function, and oxidative damage to DNA can impair cell division and repair.",

Upon injection, ExoU is activated by host cell cofactors [5\u20137] and targeted to the plasma membranes, where it cleaves membrane phospholipids, resulting in rapid lysis of a variety of cell types [8]. ExoU PLA2 activity also accounts for a potent stimulation of inflammatory response and increased release of free arachidonic acid, cytokines, eicosanoids and PAF from infected cells [9\u201311], as well as for the activation of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor via a PAFR signaling pathway [12, 13]. The proinflammatory effect of ExoU has been extensively confirmed in experimental models of pneumosepsis in which P.\naeruginosa inoculation into mice airways resulted in a rapid influx of large numbers of inflammatory cells, primarily neutrophils, into the lungs [9, 11\u201316].",

Briefly, 35 \u03bcg of protein from the different cell extracts was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 % acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5 % fat-free milk at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate Santa Cruz Biotechnology primary antibodies against \u03b2-actin, iNOS (sc-651), eNOS (sc-654) and nNOS (sc-648) in 5 % milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). After being washed with TBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 (TTBS), membranes were incubated for 1 h with appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature, washed and treated with chemiluminescence reagents (ECL Plus) for 5 min. The target bands were then imaged on a ChemiDoc\u2122 XRS and analyzed with the Image Lab\u2122 software. The expression level of the \u03b2-actin housekeeping gene was used for equal loading control in all experiments.",

In this context, oxygen metabolites may lose their physiological role in the killing of pathogens, to turn into toxic effectors responsible for the damage of the pulmonary epithelium, as well as of other components of the lung parenchyma and lining fluids [23]. In consequence, leukocyte overproduction of oxidants within lungs contributes greatly to the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening complication of severe pneumonia with high mortality rates [2]. Besides ROS production, neutrophil upregulated expression of iNOS, which accounts for enhanced production of NO, contributes also to exacerbating oxidative stress indices and to ARDS pathophysiology [24].",

Increased epithelial permeability favors the dissemination of bacterial into host bloodstream [26, 27]. Indeed, in the course of lung infection by a cytotoxic ExoU-producing P. aeruginosa strain, bacteria were shown to cause alveolar epithelial injury and progressive dissemination from infected lungs as soon as 4 h after intratracheal instillation [28]. Interestingly, in a more recent study, only relatively few alveolar epithelial cells were shown to be injected with ExoU [14]. Therefore, it seems unlikely that alveolar epithelial injury has resulted from a direct effect of ExoU, but it is plausible to assume that the increased epithelial permeability detected in mice with pneumonia by ExoU-producing bacteria has resulted from a disequilibrium between pro-oxidant and antioxidant molecules in infected lungs.",

Similar pathways leading to oxidant generation can occur in endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells [23]. A recent study revealed that, in later periods of infection, P. aeruginosa was able to induce NOX2 and NOX4 expression, but not NOX1 and NOX3, in mice lungs. NF-\u03baB was critical to the expression of both NOX1 and NOX3, but NOX2 and NOX4 seemed to have distinct roles in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, with NOX4 involved in apoptosis and disruption of endothelial barrier integrity and NOX2 in inflammation and oxidative response to the bacteria [29]. Furthermore, it has been shown that, in pulmonary endothelial and phagocytic cells, activation of NOX2 depends on the PLA2 activity of peroxiredoxin 6 [30, 31]. Since ExoU has PLA2 activity and activates NF-\u03baB, we hypothesized whether this virulence factor would be able to interfere with the production of oxidants by airway epithelial cells. In agreement with our hypothesis, PA103-infected A549 cells produced increased amounts of lipid hydroperoxide, 8-isoprostane, ROS, NO and peroxynitrite, a strong oxidant that results from the reaction of superoxide and NO.",

In our study, although airway epithelial cells infected with the ExoU-producing bacteria exhibited enhanced levels of eNOS, expression of iNOS was increased in about 1000 % at as early as 1 h after infection. A similar increase in iNOS and eNOS was reported by Lange et al. [34] in a ovine model of P. aeruginosa pneumosepsis. The novelty of our study is the demonstration of the precocity of iNOS expression in cells infected with the ExoU-producing bacteria, which likely stems from the ExoU-triggered NF-\u03baB activation by the canonical pathway [13].",

During P. aeruginosa pneumonia, gp91\nphox\u2212/\u2212 mice showed significantly lower concentrations of H2O2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage than wild-type mice [29]. Although ExoU activates NF-\u03baB via the PAF\u2013PAFR signaling [13], the increased generation of oxidizing agents is likely to further enhance the NF-kB transcriptional activity and upregulate a number of genes involved in inflammation [37].",

Indeed, enzymes such as SOD can be induced in lung by hyperoxia, bacterial LPS and virus, to name just a few examples [38, 39]. In the present study, infection by ExoU-producing P. aeruginosa resulted in significant increase in the activity of SOD, a group of enzymes that convert superoxide anion to H2O2. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase exert their antioxidant activity by converting H2O2 to water and oxygen. In our study, the increase in SOD activity together with the decreased levels of GSH suggest that infection by ExoU-producing bacteria likely resulted in enhanced intracellular H2O2 production that was at least partially detoxified by glutathione peroxidase.",
