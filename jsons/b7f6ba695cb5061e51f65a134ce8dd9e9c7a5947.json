Since human Vc9Vd2 T lymphocytes play a critical role in the immune response against viruses, we analyzed their antiviral functions on Huh7 hepatoma cells carrying the subgenomic HCV replicon (Rep60 cells). In a transwell culture system, Rep60 cells were co-cultured with either PBMCs or highly purified cd T cells stimulated by non-peptidic antigens. Vc9Vd2 T cell activation was associated with a dramatic reduction of HCV RNA levels. Neutralizing antibodies targeting IFN-c revealed a critical role for this cytokine in the inhibition of HCV replication. Interestingly, drugs already in clinical use, such as Phosphostim and Zoledronate, known to activate cd T cells, were shown to induce the inhibition of HCV replication mediated by Vc9Vd2 T cells of HCV patients. Our data suggest that the therapeutic activation of Vc9Vd2 T lymphocytes may represent an additional strategy to inhibit HCV replication and to restore a T h 1-oriented immune response in HCV-infected patients.",

These cytokines were mainly released by Vd2 T cells. In fact, intracellular staining assays of PBMCs cultured for 6 h in the presence of IPP showed that this stimulation induced a high frequency of TNF-a-and IFN-c-producing Vd2+ cells ( Fig. 2B and C; 28.5 and 30% of the total Vd2+ cells, respectively). In contrast, bystander production of these cytokines by other cells was not significant (0.6 and 0.2%, respectively), confirming that IPP selectively activates Vc9Vd2 T cells.",

For this experiment we used cellfree supernatants. These supernatants, obtained from Vc9Vd2 T cells stimulated with IPP for different periods of time, were able to inhibit HCV replication in Rep60 cells at a similar extent of co-cultures (Fig. 3, lane 2 , and data not shown), thus confirming that the IPP-stimulated cd T cells produce cytokines which exert antiviral activity. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that the block of IFN-c activity by specific neutralizing antibodies (28) significantly reduced the HCV replication inhibition (Fig. 3, lane 6) . On the contrary, no impairment of the HCV-inhibitory activity was observed using neutralizing antibodies against either TNF-a (data not shown) or IFN-a (Fig. 3, lane 4) . As control for the neutralizing activity of mAbs used in our experiments, Rep60 cells were treated with IFN-a or IFN-c, two known inhibitors of HCV replication (25, 26) , either in the presence or absence of the specific neutralizing mAbs (Fig. 3 , lanes 8-13 and lanes 14-19, respectively). As expected, both anti-IFN-a and anti-IFN-c mAbs were able to block HCV replicon clearance even at high doses of cytokines (Fig. 3 , lane 13 and lane 19, respectively). It is worthy to note that high concentrations of recombinant TNF-a were not able to influence HCV RNA levels (data not shown). Our data demonstrate that antiviral activity of IPP-activated Vc9Vd2 T cells is mainly mediated through IFN-c production.",

After 16 h, IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 cells was analyzed by intracellular staining assay. Notably, as shown in Fig. 4(C) , in the absence of ZOL stimulation, Rep60 cells, as well as the parental cell line Huh7, did not induce a significant IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 T cells (0.44%), thus indicating that HCV replicon per se was not able to trigger Vc9Vd2 T lymphocytes activation. On the other hand, ZOL pre-treated Rep60 and Huh7 cells induced a similar IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 T cells, thus suggesting that ZOL induces Vc9Vd2 T cell activation through an HCVindependent indirect mechanism, probably by an accumulation of mevalonate metabolites in the cells.",

Moreover, the current regimens based on IFN-a and ribavirin are not effective in a considerable number of HCV patients. Therefore, the development of additional therapeutical approaches is needed. In this study, taking advantage of the subgenomic HCV replicon system in hepatoma cells (21, 22) , we analyzed the anti-HCV activity of cd T cells. The major contribution of this work is the finding that Vc9Vd2 T lymphocytes exert an antiviral activity against HCV when activated by non-peptidic antigens. We found that IPP stimulation of either PBMCs or highly purified cd T lymphocytes induced a drastic inhibition of HCV replication. This antiviral activity was mediated by the release of non-cytolytic antiviral factors since it was independent of cell-cell contacts and obtained using the supernatants of IPPstimulated cultures. By the use of neutralizing antibodies we have demonstrated that, in our cell-culture system, the inhibition of HCV replication is exerted through the release of IFN-c. This result is in line with the ability of recombinant IFN-c to inhibit HCV replicon replication (25) . We identified the Vc9Vd2 T population as the effector cells of the IPPmediated antiviral activity. Although, we cannot completely rule out a possible effect of other contaminating effector cells, intracellular staining experiments demonstrated that the main IFN-c-producing cells are Vd2 T lymphocytes. Moreover, the ability of highly purified cd T lymphocytes to inhibit HCV replication strongly suggested that this cell population is likely to be the main mediator of the antiviral activity. It has been shown that HCV-specific CD8 T cells are able to inhibit HCV replication by both direct cytolytic effects and cytokinemediated activity (7) . Our findings extend to the cells of innate immunity the capability to induce an activity against HCV. Evidences that cd T cells mediate antiviral activity through the release of non-cytolytic soluble factors have been already reported. In human immunodeficiency virus infection, several data indicate that Vc9Vd2 T cells exert both cytolytic (29, 30) and non-cytolytic antiviral activity through the release IFN-a (lanes 3 and 4) or IFN-c (lanes 5 and 6). PBMC supernatants were pre-incubated with neutralizing antibodies for 30 min before being added to Rep60 cell cultures. Increasing doses of either IFN-a (lanes 8-10 and 11-13) or IFN-c (lanes 14-16 and 17-19) were used to determine the neutralization ability of the mAbs to IFN-a (lanes [11] [12] [13] or IFN-c (lanes [17] [18] [19] .

            "text": "IFN-c is a key molecule in the immune response against viral infections, modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses and stimulating several intracellular pathways that directly suppress viral replication without killing the host cells (35, 36) . In HCV infections, the ability of T cells to produce IFN-c in the acute phase has been associated to viral clearance in humans (37) . In chronic HCV-infected patients, an impairment of peripheral-specific T cells to produce IFN-c and hepatic expansion of HCV-specific CD8+ T cells with regulatory phenotype have been reported (38) . Moreover, in chimpanzees the expansion of a T h 1-oriented, multi-specific and Fig. 4 . Drugs containing non-peptidic antigens induce HCV replication inhibition and Vc9Vd2 T cell-mediated IFN-c production. (A) Detection of the presence of HCV replicon in Rep60 cells. Rep60 cells were co-cultured with PBMCs, isolated from healthy donors, either in the absence (Med) or in the presence of IPP, ZOL or Phosphostim (BrHPP). After 4 days of co-culture, the HCV RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR as described in Fig. 1(A) . A representative experiment is shown (n \u00bc 5). (B) ZOL and BrHPP treatments induce IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 T cells. PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were treated with either ZOL or BrHPP for 24 h and two-color intracellular flow cytometric analysis was performed as described in Fig. 2(C) . The percentage of positive cells is reported. In parentheses the percentage of IFN-c-producing Vd2 T cells among total Vd2 T cells is reported. A representative analysis of one experiment is shown (n \u00bc 5). (C) IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 T cell lines co-cultured with Rep60 and Huh7 cells in a cell-cell contact system. Vc9Vd2 Tcell lines, >80% pure population obtained as described in Methods, were cocultured in a cell-cell contact system with Rep60 cells (black circle) or the parental cell line Huh7 (white circle; i.e. not containing the HCV replicon) either untreated (\u00ff) or pre-treated for 2 h with ZOL at different doses as indicated. After 16 h of co-culture, the IFN-c production by Vd2 T cells was evaluated by two-color intracellular flow cytometric analysis, as described in Fig. 2(C) . A representative experiment is shown (n \u00bc 3). The IFN-c production by Vd2 T cells was evaluated by two-color intracellular flow cytometric analysis, as described in Fig. 2(C) . The bars encompass the middle 50% of the individual measurements and the horizontal bar-dividing line indicates the median value. The vertical lines span the range of the lowest and highest measurements. Differences were not statistically significant. (B) Detection of the presence of HCV replicon in Rep60 cells. Rep60 cells were cocultured with PBMCs, isolated from HCV patients (PBMC/HCV+), either in the absence (Med) or in the presence of IPP, ZOL or Phosphostim (BrHPP). After 4 days of co-culture, the HCV RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR as described in Fig. 1(A) . A representative experiment is shown (n \u00bc 3). sustained T cell response was associated with the resolution of HCV infection (39) . These data indicate that the establishment of chronic infection may be associated to a status of low inflammation level. This could lead to an inhibition of T h 1-specific immune response and to an expansion of IL-10producing T cells, thus suggesting that IFN-c production could be one of the key events for the resolution of HCV infection.",

However, since we utilized the subgenomic HCV replicon that lacks structural proteins, we cannot completely rule out that Vc9Vd2 T cells are not involved in the recognition of HCV-infected hepatocytes. Our data suggest that cd T cells, in spite of their apparent lack of specificity in virus recognition, could play an important role in the immune response against viruses by releasing IFN-c and, likely, other non-cytolytic soluble factors. An interesting feature of the cd T cell biology is the possibility to induce their activation by non-peptidic antigens. Vc9Vd2 T cells were shown to release T h 1 cytokines and to mediate a cytoreductive effect on myeloma cells when activated by N-containing bisphosphonates (16) . Moreover, Phosphostim-activated Vc9Vd2 T cells kill autologous metastatic renal carcinoma (20) . We showed that the non-peptidic antigens ZOL and BrHPP were able to induce HCV replicon clearance mediated by PBMCs derived from both healthy donors and, more importantly, HCV patients. Vc9Vd2 T cells released IFN-c when directly stimulated by non-peptidic antigens, indicating that, at least in the peripheral blood, cd T cells of HCV patients could be specifically activated by these drugs. Interestingly, some of these non-peptidic antigens are already in clinical use (18) , thus suggesting the feasibility of this approach in humans.",

On the other hand, no effects on HCV RNA levels were observed with unstimulated PBMCs (lane 4 and lane 6 for donors 0502 and 2902, respectively), indicating that IPP activation is necessary to induce the inhibition of HCV replication and suggesting, therefore, the direct involvement of Vc9Vd2 T cells. IFN-a, known to inhibit subgenomic HCV replication (26), was used as control (lane 3). Similar results were obtained using PBMCs isolated from other 15 healthy donors (data not shown). Notably, flow cytometric analysis of PBMCs confirmed that IPP stimulation induces the expression of different activation markers (CD25, CD69 and HLA-DR) exclusively on the Vd2 T lymphocyte surface from all donors analyzed (data not shown).",

After 4 days of co-culture, total RNA was extracted and HCV RNA was detected by conventional RT-PCR, using specific oligos for NS4A region. As a loading control, levels of b-actin mRNA were analyzed. IFN-a was used to induce HCV replicon clearance. (B) Measurement of the HCV replicon copies number in Rep60 cells by quantitative real-time PCR.
