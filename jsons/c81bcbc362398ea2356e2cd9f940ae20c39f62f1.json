Campi et al [2] have reported very interesting data on the burden of major non-deferrable surgical procedures to treat genitourinary malignancies performed at three high-volume referral centers in Italy with the aim of guiding reorganization and prioritization of urological surgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic [2] . Non-deferrable procedures were defined according to a recently published expert opinion on patient triage during the pandemic [3], and four were selected for their study: radical nephroureterectomy, radical cystectomy, and radical nephrectomy and prostatectomy for high-risk disease. Notably, these non-deferrable procedures accounted for approximately one-third of all cases treated over a 12-mo period, and approximately onequarter of those procedures were performed in patients at high preoperative anesthesiology risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] score \uf0b33) [2] . The latter figure is critical if we consider that cardiovascular, respiratory, and infective comorbidities and a need for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Moreover, the timely contribution by Campi et al [2] might have been enriched by consideration of another novel factor influencing the reorganization of surgical activities, namely fear of contracting COVID-19. It is likely that this could be viewed as one of the most common adverse events following the national lockdown in Italy from March 9, 2020. Patients might decline the opportunity to be operated on because of this fear, especially in a COVID-19 hospital, requesting postponement of their treatment. No data on this phenomenon are currently available.",

Fifteen patients (29%) had high anesthesiology risk (ASA score \uf0b33), but only seven (14%) were excluded because of a need for postoperative intensive care (2 cases with cT2 bladder cancer, 1 case with renal tumor with inferior cava involvement, 1 case with high-risk prostate cancer, and 3 cases with high-risk bladder cancer). Interestingly, 16/51 patients (31.3%) declined the planned treatment and asked to postpone it until after the pandemic, including 6/24 (25%) scheduled for major surgeries (3 cases of radical prostatectomy for high-risk disease and 3 cases of radical/partial nephrectomy for cT2 renal tumors) and 10/27 (37%) for TURB.
