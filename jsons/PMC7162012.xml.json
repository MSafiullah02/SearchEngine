In most of the cases, the studies are carried out on a limited number of inhibitors. Due to this reason, they predict the inhibitors that are similar to the compound type with a high correlation, but do not work on other dissimilar inhibitors for the same target virus. To address these limitations, AVCpred models have been developed using diverse and large number of inhibitors. In the current algorithm, we have employed antiviral compound datasets from different studies due to which the overall correlation is less than above studies, yet the models are comparatively more robust to predict different classes of inhibitors. However, as new high\u2010throughput screening data tested under homogeneous conditions on antiviral drugs becomes available, performance of the QSAR method can be improved.",

The warning value of leverage (h*) is considered as 3p/n, where p is the number of model descriptors plus one and n is the number of training compounds.62, 63 If the leverage of a compound exceeds h*, it is regarded as dissident.
