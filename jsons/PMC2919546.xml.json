The genoprevalences for WUPyV and KIPyV in respiratory samples from children with acute respiratory tract diseases were found to range from 1.1 to 7.0% [4-10] and 0.9 to 2.7% [3,6-8,11], respectively. However, WUPyV and KIPyV DNA were found at similar frequencies in control groups without respiratory tract disease [5,8,11]. Therefore, the clinical relevance of WUPyV and KIPyV infections is currently unclear. In contrast to PCR assays, serological assays for antibody detection against HBoV are more complex to establish. However, determining immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies in appropriate serum or plasma samples allows to define the point in time of primary infection as well as exposure rates. One study describing the seroepidemiology of polyomaviruses including WUPyV and KIPyV in adults has recently been published [12].",

Elucidation of the clinical relevance of HBoV has been difficult because of a high co-infection rate of HBoV DNA positive samples with other respiratory viruses. Based on the combination of a high HBoV load in nasopharyngeal samples (> 104 copies/ml) and concomitant HBoV DNA detection in sera, a model has been proposed in which HBoV is associated with acute respiratory tract diseases but persists in the respiratory tract for a longer period of time than other respiratory viruses after primary infection [14]. Recent serological studies have demonstrated evidence of primary HBoV infection in children with acute respiratory tract diseases, strongly indicating that HBoV is indeed a respiratory pathogen [15,16]. In seroprevalence studies from Japan, the United States, China, and Germany the proportions of HBoV IgG-positive samples increased with age during infancy until reaching levels of > 80% at the age of > 4 years [15,17-19].",

Similarly, the VP1 genes of WUPyV and KIPyV were amplified from nasopharyngeal aspirates with the primer pairs WU1673s/WU2782a and KI1501s/KI2727a resulting in amplicons of 1109 bp and 1226 bp, respectively (Table 1). Sequences were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers FJ560720 (HBoV), EU711057 (WUPyV), and FJ647575 (KIPyV). For production of the recombinant baculoviruses BacWUVP1, BacKIVP1, and BacBOVP2 the LR recombination system (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, the amplicons were inserted by TOPO cloning into the pENTR vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently transformed in chemically competent E.coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids pBOVP2, pWUVP1, and pKIVP1 were extracted from overnight culture with the QIAprepSpin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced by standard techniques to confirm orientation and sequence identity of the plasmid insert. The plasmid inserts were then transferred into baculoviral DNA by homologous recombination based on Gateway technology and the BaculoDirect system (Invitrogen). The resulting recombinant baculovirus DNA was directly transfected to adherent Sf9 cells in one well of a six-well-plate using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were kept in TC-100 growth medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B, and 100 \u03bcM ganciclovir as selective reagent. After five days, the cell culture supernatant was collected and used to infect fresh Sf9 cells. This procedure was repeated twice, resulting in the supernatant of passage 4 (P4), which was finally collected and stored at 4\u00b0C for further use.",

All samples were also tested by IFA using uninfected Sf9 cells. No positive reaction with cellular antigens was observed in any of the samples. In order to further confirm the specificity of positive IFA results, three plasma samples were studied in an absorption assay. Antibody titers were determined before and after absorption with lysates of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. A significant titer decrease was only observed after absorption with the matching Sf9 cell lysate (Table 2). There was no indication of antibody cross-reaction between Sf9 cells infected with BacWUVP1, BacKIVP1, and BacBOVP2.",

We found high rates of positive IgG antibodies against all three viruses: 89% for WUPyV, 67% for KIPyV, and 76% for HBoV. Our data on seroprevalence for WUPyV and KIPyV are somewhat higher than reported in a recent study from the United States, which found seroprevalences of 54.1% to 55.3% for KIPyV and 67.4% to 70.9% for WUPyV in the age groups from 21 to 70 years of North American blood donors [12]. In contrast to our findings, a rising prevalence for KIPyV IgG in adults was not observed. Further studies are necessary in order to determine whether there may be regional differences in the KIPyV epidemiology. Taken together, the data of Kean et al. and of our study indicate that WUPyV and KIPyV have a widespread distribution similar to the well-known polyomaviruses BKV and JCV. Also in agreement with BKV and JCV epidemiology, primary exposure seems to occur mainly in childhood and youth. Primary BKV infection has been reported to occur mainly in the first decade of life leading to a seroprevalence of 65% to 90% at the age of 10 (reviewed in [20]). The JCV seroprevalence in adults has been found between 44% and 97%. Whereas some studies reported a time frame for primary JCV infection similar to BKV infections, others showed a continuing rise of the JCV seroprevalence during adulthood (reviewed by [20]).",
