SPATA22, along with its direct binding partner and functional collaborator, MEIOB, is essential for the proper repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiotic recombination. Here we describe a novel point-mutated allele (shani) of mouse Spata22 that we isolated in a forward genetic screen. shani mutant mice phenocopy Spata22-null and Meiob-null mice: mutant cells appear to form DSBs and initiate meiotic recombination, but are unable to complete DSB repair, leading to meiotic prophase arrest, apoptosis and sterility. shani mutants show precocious loss of DMC1 foci and improper accumulation of BLM-positive recombination foci, reinforcing the requirement of SPATA22-MEIOB for the proper progression of meiotic recombination events. The shani mutation lies within a Spata22 coding exon and molecular characterization shows that it leads to incorrect splicing of the Spata22 mRNA, ultimately resulting in no detectable SPATA22 protein. We propose that the shani mutation alters an exonic splicing enhancer element (ESE) within the Spata22 transcript. The affected DNA nucleotide is conserved in most tetrapods examined, suggesting that the splicing regulation we describe here may be a conserved feature of Spata22 regulation.",

The meiotic cell division program contains an extended prophase, during which replicated homologous chromosomes pair and recombine. This creates temporary connections called crossovers that are essential to stabilize homologs on the metaphase spindle during segregation (Page and Hawley 2003; Hunter 2015) . Errors in these events can cause gametogenic failure and infertility, or can produce aneuploid gametes that in turn result in miscarriage and developmental defects (Hassold and Hunt 2001; Sasaki et al. 2010) .",

Then, DMC1, the meiosis-specific strandexchange protein, along with its ubiquitously expressed paralog, RAD51, assembles onto ssDNA to form nucleoprotein filaments that conduct homology search and strand invasion. The resulting recombination intermediates are repaired by multiple pathways to ultimately give either non-crossover products or crossovers (Baudat et al. 2013; Hunter 2015) . Recombination intermediates and their repair pathways are closely regulated to guarantee the formation of at least one crossover per homolog pair (Hunter 2015; Zickler and Kleckner 2015) . While we have a broad-strokes picture of the factors involved and their contributions to meiotic recombination, mechanistic detail of their individual molecular functions and their cross-talk is lacking. We also lack clear understanding of how meiosis-specific proteins collaborate with ubiquitous repair proteins to specialize homologous recombination during meiosis. Moreover, it is unclear whether the catalog of relevant vertebrate proteins important for meiotic recombination is complete.",

The mouse Spata22 transcript encodes a protein of 358 amino acids and 40.17 kDa (presented schematically in Fig. 2e ). Searches in protein databases revealed that placental mammals possess a similar SPATA22 protein: 358 to 364 amino acids in length with two well-conserved domains, a short motif located near the Nterminus and a longer region located near the C-terminus (yellow boxes in Fig. 2e) . These domains were present in SPATA22 homologs from all vertebrates examined and were separated by a less conserved region of ~190 amino acids. Using these domains to search, SPATA22 homologs were retrieved in invertebrates such as echinoderms, cnidarians and molluscs (Fig. 2e, Table S1 ). In several distant animals, e.g. arthropods (Arthropoda) and sponges (Porifera), a likely homolog restricted to the C-terminal domain could be retrieved but with substantial divergence from other homologs ( Table S1) . The conserved C-terminal domain corresponds to the region in mouse that is required for interaction with MEIOB, the functional collaborator and direct binding partner of SPATA22 (Xu et al. 2017; Ribeiro et al. 2018) , suggesting that the SPATA22-MEIOB interaction is likely a conserved property of SPATA22.",

However, homozygous mutant males and females were sterile: none of the three Spata22 shani/shani males tested sired progeny when bred with wild-type females for 13-17 weeks and no pregnancies were observed from crosses of three homozygous mutant females to wild-type males (bred for 17 weeks).",

Mutants contained abnormal tubule types: some tubules ('Em' in Fig. 3a ) had only a single layer of Sertoli cells and presumptive spermatogonia along the tubule perimeter; and some also had spermatogenic cells that appeared apoptotic ('Apo' in Fig. 3a) . Increased apoptosis was confirmed by elevated TUNEL staining in mutants (Fig. 3b, c) . These patterns are consistent with spermatocyte arrest and apoptosis during pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, occurring possibly at stage IV of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, which is typical of mutants with meiotic recombination defects (for example Dmc1 -/- (Barchi et al. 2005) ) and is also observed in Spata22null males (Hays et al. 2017) .",

We next examined meiotic recombination events, specifically DSB formation, repair and chromosome synapsis. We immunostained chromosome spreads of spermatocytes for SYCP3, a component of the chromosome axes (Lammers et al. 1994; Zickler and Kleckner 2015) , and for \u03b3H2AX, a phosphorylated form of histone variant H2AX that is generated in response to DSBs (Mahadevaiah et al. 2001) (Fig. 4a) . In normal meiosis, sister chromatids begin to form a SYCP3-containing protein axis from which chromatin loops emanate during the leptotene stage of meiotic prophase. During the zygotene stage, axes elongate and homologous chromosome axes begin to align and form stretches of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a tripartite structure comprising the homologous axial elements and the central region connecting them. The SC elongates and connects homologous chromosomes along their lengths in the pachytene stage. The SC disassembles during the diplotene stage (Fig. 4a) . DSB formation occurs primarily during leptonema and zygonema, yielding nucleus-wide \u03b3H2AX staining. The \u03b3H2AX staining disappears progressively as recombination proceeds and is largely gone from autosomes during pachynema. \u03b3H2AX is also present on the X and Y chromosomes in the sex body during pachynema and diplonema (Fig. 4a) .",

In wild type, SYCP1 staining appears during zygonema as cells begin to build the SC, it marks autosomes along their lengths during pachynema when the SC connects homologous chromosomes and is largely absent from the autosomes in diplonema when the SC is disassembled (Fig. 4b) . In Spata22 shani/shani littermates, leptonema and mid zygonema appeared normal. But later-stage spermatocytes (late zygonema-like and pachynema-like) had SYCP1 patterns indicative of synapsis defects: numerous Spata22 shani/shani spermatocytes possessed a mix of partially synapsed, fully synapsed and asynaptic chromosomes, along with chromosome tangles (i.e., a mix of synapsed and unsynapsed axes with partner switches indicative of nonhomologous synapsis; Fig. 4b ). These patterns are typical of recombination-and synapsis-defective mutants such as Dmc1 -/- (Pittman et al. 1998; Yoshida et al. 1998) , and are comparable to that observed in Spata22-null spermatocytes (Hays et al. 2017) . We conclude that Spata22 shani/shani spermatocytes have a defect in meiotic DSB repair and chromosome synapsis, leading to meiotic prophase arrest and apoptosis.

SYCP3 staining patterns were used to define meiotic prophase stages and only recombination protein foci overlapping with SYCP3-positive axes were counted. We first analyzed DMC1 strand-exchange protein that assembles on ssDNA formed at DSBs and is required for homology search and strand invasion during meiotic recombination (Brown and Bishop 2014) . In normal meiosis, DMC1 foci appear in leptonema, accumulate to maximal levels in early to mid zygonema, then decline as DSB repair proceeds through pachynema ( Fig. 5a, b) . In Spata22 shani/shani , DMC1 foci accumulate during early stages but prematurely decline in mid zygonema and are severely reduced in late zygonema compared to wild type ( Fig. 5a, b ; mean foci count of mid zygonema and late zygonema-like Spata22 shani/shani = 96 and 27, respectively; mean foci count of mid zygonema and late zygonema wild type = 154 and 101, respectively). These findings are consistent with previous observations of DMC1 behavior in Spata22-mutant rats as well as in mice lacking MEIOB, the functional collaborator and direct binding partner of SPATA22 (Souquet et al. 2013; Ishishita et al. 2014) . Spata22 shani/shani DMC1 foci counts in late leptonema and early zygonema, although not statistically significant, were lower compared to wild type (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that DMC1 accumulation may also be modestly affected at these stages.",

In wild type, RPA2 foci form during leptonema, increase in early and mid zygonema, and then decrease as DSB repair progresses in late zygonema and early pachynema (Fig. 5c, d) . Spata22 shani/shani cells accumulate RPA2 foci during early stages and arrest during zygonema with RPA2 foci present (Fig. 5c, d) . This is as observed in Spata22mutant rats and Meiob -/mice (Luo et al. 2013; Souquet et al. 2013; Ishishita et al. 2014) , suggesting that arrested cells likely possess ssDNA-containing intermediates. We observed that RPA2 foci counts in mid zygonema and late zygonema were reduced compared to wild type ( Fig. 5d ; mean foci count of mid zygonema and late zygonemalike Spata22 shani/shani = 198 and 134, respectively; mean foci count of mid zygonema and late zygonema wild type = 242 and 205, respectively), likely due to defects in recombination intermediate processing during these stages.",

BLM and its orthologs process multiple types of recombination intermediates (Singh et al. 2009; De Muyt et al. 2012) . BLM has been previously reported to form discrete foci on chromosome axes during wild-type meiosis (Moens et al. 2000; Holloway et al. 2010) and to accumulate in recombination-deficient mutants (Holloway et al. 2008; Holloway et al. 2010 ). In our hands, BLM was barely detectable in most wild-type spermatocytes, with few cells forming clear axis-associated foci that met our immunofluorescence cutoff (Fig. 5e, f) . In contrast to wild type, Spata22 shani/shani had bright and numerous BLM foci on chromosome axes (Fig. 5e, f) . RPA has been shown to stimulate BLM activity in vitro and to colocalize with BLM during meiosis (Walpita et al. 1999; Brosh et al. 2000) , therefore we asked if the BLM foci we see in mutants colocalized with RPA. Most BLM foci also had an RPA2 focus present (Fig. 5g) . BLM foci were first detected in early zygonema and levels continued to rise as cells progressed to mid zygonema and late zygonema-like stages (mean foci count of late zygonema-like Spata22 shani/shani = 55). Our results suggest that in Spata22 shani/shani , either there is increased BLM recruitment (for example, an increase in the presence or accessibility of BLM targets) or that BLM is abnormally retained. Taken together, our results indicate a failure to repair DSBs appropriately and/or the presence of aberrant DNA structures in Spata22 shani/shani .",

Spata22 shani/shani mutant spermatocytes appear to initiate DSB formation normally during meiotic prophase, but show defects in DSB repair and synapsis, leading to spermatocyte arrest, apoptosis, shrunken gonads and infertility. We performed molecular characterization of the shani mutation and show that it leads to defective splicing of the Spata22 RNA, ultimately resulting in loss of detectable SPATA22 protein. Consistent with this, Spata22 shani and Spata22-null alleles have similar meiotic phenotypes (Hays et al. 2017). Our work illustrates the power of forward-genetic approaches in exploring the regulation of mammalian meiosis. Moreover, we describe a unique screen design and demonstrate its feasibility: we exploited a hallmark of meiotic recombination defects, hypogonadism, to design an efficient and simple readout based on testes weights. Also, we utilized a new mutation identification strategy that leverages recent genomic advances.",

            "text": "We show that SPATA22 has two well-conserved domains: an N-terminal segment and a longer region located near the C-terminus. Similar findings have been previously reported, although the precise boundary of the conserved C-terminal domain differs (La Salle et al. 2012) . The N-terminus of SPATA22 has no predicted structure or known function. The conserved C-terminal region we describe here (228-341 amino acids) closely matches its predicted OB foldcontaining domain (277-356 amino acids), which is essential for its interaction with MEIOB (Xu et al. 2017; Ribeiro et al. 2018) . Like SPATA22, MEIOB is predicted to have OB fold-containing domains (Luo et al. 2013; Souquet et al. 2013; Ribeiro et al. 2016 ) and domain architectures of both proteins resemble those of RPA subunits (Luo et al. 2013; Ribeiro et al. 2016; Ribeiro et al. 2018) . Also, both proteins interact and colocalize with RPA subunits (Luo et al. 2013; Souquet et al. 2013; Ishishita et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2017; Ribeiro et al. 2018 ). These findings lead to the hypothesis that the SPATA22-MEIOB complex collaborates with RPA to regulate meiotic recombination. The precise stoichiometry of the complex and whether it includes RPA subunits or other proteins remains unclear, however. The biochemical role of the SPATA22-MEIOB complex is also unknown. A truncated form of MEIOB has been reported to have exonuclease activity in vitro (Luo et al. 2013 ) and recent studies show that SPATA22-MEIOB can organize RPA-coated ssDNA in vitro (Ribeiro et al. 2018) . How these activities relate to its meiotic recombination function in vivo is unclear.",

We found that in the absence of SPATA22-MEIOB, DMC1 foci numbers decrease faster than in wild type (this manuscript and (Souquet et al. 2013) ). This was also observed for RAD51 in mice lacking MEIOB and rats lacking SPATA22 (Souquet et al. 2013; Ishishita et al. 2014) . One study did not report an earlier loss of strand-exchange proteins (Luo et al. 2013 ), but they analyzed juvenile mice where recombination foci dynamics have been reported to differ (Zelazowski et al. 2017) . We found that RPA2 foci number also decrease earlier than in wild type. Since RPA is thought to decorate multiple recombination intermediates, one possibility is that there is a defect in the formation or stability of a subpopulation of RPA foci. The reduction in RPA2 foci number was not described previously in Spata22 or Meiob mutants (Luo et al. 2013; Souquet et al. 2013; Ishishita et al. 2014) ; differences in strain background may explain this discrepancy. The disappearance of DMC1 and RPA during wild-type meiosis is an indicator of repair progression, thus a simple interpretation of our data is that some repair processes may occur faster or earlier in mutants, at least at some sites.",

The identity of these RPA foci is unknown and may represent a combination of different wild-type and mutant states. Mutants also show persistent \u03b3H2AX staining (La Salle et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2013; Souquet et al. 2013; Ishishita et al. 2014; Hays et al. 2017 ). These results indicate that not all sites are properly repaired, if any. It is possible that strand invasion occurs and DMC1 is lost, but that one or more subsequent steps such as D-loop stability or DNA synthesis or second end capture are misregulated. It is also possible that strandexchange proteins are destabilized or that their ssDNA substrates are reduced, modified or become less accessible. All these scenarios may lead to the presence of structures that would be recognized by BLM and could explain the dramatic BLM accumulation we see in mutants. BLM plays multiple roles to eventually prevent formation of potentially toxic structures: BLM disrupts RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments or D-loops, stimulates primer extension and promotes Holliday junction dissolution (Wu et al. 2001; Bugreev et al. 2007 ). Regardless of the underlying role of BLM in mutants, its accumulation reinforces the requirement of SPATA22-MEIOB in proper processing of recombination intermediates.",

MEILB2 interacts with BRCA2, which promotes RAD51/DMC1 nucleoprotein filament formation, and Meilb2 -/meiotic cells fail to form RAD51/DMC1 foci (Brandsma et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2019) . The authors propose that SPATA22-MEIOB may be involved in MEILB2 and BRCA2 recruitment to DNA, which would then facilitate RAD51/DMC1 loading (Zhang et al. 2019) . This model predicts that RAD51/DMC1 would not accumulate in SPATA22-MEIOB mutants. We observe only a modest reduction in DMC1 foci numbers during leptonema and early zygonema, but we do not know whether the DMC1 foci we detect at any of these stages are properly organized, stable or functional. Our results support the idea that RAD51/DMC1 filament assembly, stability and disassembly involves a complex regulatory network with cross-talk between multiple factors. The molecular determinants of these interactions remain to be elucidated.",

            "text": "We performed molecular characterization of the shani lesion and uncovered surprising regulation of Spata22 gene expression. The shani mutation alters nucleotide sequences within exon 4 that are crucial for accurate splicing of Spata22. The splicing regulation we document here has been reported in mammalian genes, where long introns and weakly defined exon-intron boundaries are supported by both exonic and intronic cis-acting elements that either stimulate or repress splicing. One prevalent exonic element, called ESE, serves as a binding site for splicing factors called serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins to promote exon definition (Blencowe 2000; Cartegni et al. 2002) . There are several instances where disease-causing mutations that result in alternative splicing have been proposed to affect ESEs and mutations that abrogate an ESE often cause exon-skipping (Blencowe 2000; Cartegni et al. 2002) , akin to that observed in shani mutants. We propose that the shani mutation possibly alters an ESE element within exon 4 in the Spata22 transcript, leading to skipping of exon 4 by the spliceosome, making this, to our knowledge, the first description of an ESE element in a murine meiotic gene. While ESE elements lack a well-defined consensus sequence, combinatorial in vivo and in vitro approaches have led to the identification of 6-to 8-nucleotide long ESE sequence motifs and been used to develop computational ESEprediction tools (Blencowe 2000; Cartegni et al. 2002) . Indeed, the CCAGAGG and CAGAGGT overlapping sequences encompassing the affected adenine in shani mutants are recognized as putative ESE motifs by the ESEfinder ESE-prediction web tool (Cartegni et al. 2003) .",

This indicates that the splicing regulation we describe above may not be restricted to mouse, but rather may be a conserved feature of Spata22 gene expression regulation. Similar regulation may be important for controlling other meiotic genes, especially given the extensive gene expression modulations that occur during meiosis and germ cell development. Our findings highlight how coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms can deregulate/alter splicing events and lead to phenotypic variability or gene inactivation during development. Moreover, our isolation and characterization of the shani allele of Spata22 demonstrates the power of forward genetic approaches in uncovering unexpected gene regulation in mammals.",

Thus variants called from distinct mutant lines sequenced in parallel with the shani mutant line were filtered out to identify variants that are private to the shani line (i.e., found in shani mutant mice but not in mice of other mutant lines). If the shani mutant phenotype was caused by a single autosomal recessive mutation, shani mutant mice were expected to be homozygous for the phenotype-causing mutation and share this mutation. Thus variants were further filtered to only include those that were called as homozygous, had a minimum sequencing depth of five reads, and were not known between-strain SNPs. Next we searched for variants that were shared between all five G3 shani mutant mice. This yielded three single nucleotide substitutions at the following positions: Chr11:73187728 in intron of Ctns (A to G substitution), Chr11:73336037 in exon of Spata22 (A to G substitution) and Chr11:76138184 in intron of Vps53 (A to T substitution).",

The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. Reagents and mouse strains are available upon request. All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.

Male mice (C57BL/6J strain) were mutagenized and crossed to wild-type females (FVB/NJ strain) to produce founder (F1) males that were potential mutation carriers. Each F1 male was then crossed to wild-type females (FVB/NJ strain) to generate second generation (G2) offspring and G2 daughters were crossed back to their F1 sire to generate third-generation (G3) offspring. G3 males were screened for meiotic defects. If an F1 male was a carrier of a single autosomal recessive mutation of interest, roughly half of his G2 daughters were expected to be carriers and roughly one eighth of G3 males were expected to be homozygous. Un-filled shapes represent animals that are wild-type for a mutation of interest, half-filled shapes are heterozygous carriers, and filled shapes are homozygotes. b Screen results for the shani line. The F1 male was harembred to four G2 females, yielding 38 G3 males that displayed either a wild-type or shani phenotype (a\u2032, a\u2032\u2032, a\u2032\u2032\u2032, b\u2032). Due to the harem-breeding setup we were unable to determine the proportion of G3 animals birthed from any given G2 female. c Testes-to-body-weight ratios for G3 mice screened (listed in panel b). Total number of G3 mice screened (n) is indicated and shani mutants (a\u2032, a\u2032\u2032, a\u2032\u2032\u2032, b\u2032) are annotated.",
