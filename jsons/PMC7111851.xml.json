PEDV is an enveloped single-stranded RNA Coronavirus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus. PEDV genome (28 kb in length) has seven open reading frames (ORFs) and encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) as well as three non-structural proteins: replicates 1a, 1b and ORF3 (Song and Park, 2012). Among these proteins, PEDV S glycoprotein shows an important role on host cell entry and viral virulence and could be divided structurally into the S1 and S2 regions (Song and Park, 2012), which is also a key protein exhibiting major genetic variations among different stains (Sun et al., 2015).",

Since 1980s, it has been widespread in Asia (Song and Park, 2012). A massive PED outbreaks were reported in China in 2010, which associated with a novel PEDV strain (Pandemic strains) that was genetically distant from the Prototype PEDV strain CV777 (Chen et al., 2010). The first case of PED (Pandemic strains) in North America was reported in April 2013. In 2014, the new variants, INDEL strains, containing insertions and deletions in the N terminal region of the S1 gene was found in American (Vlasova et al., 2014). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated PEDV strains fell clearly into two distinct groups, G1 (Prototype strain) and G2 (Pandemic strains) based on neighbor-joining method; G2 further separated into two subgroups:G2a and G2b (Huang et al., 2013).",

The 3 PEDV S2\u25b3strains were grouped into G2b Pandemic strains, and the remaining 7 PEDV strains were grouped into G2a Pandemic strains (Fig. 2). In G2b, PEDV S2\u25b3strains (CH/hubei/2015, CH/hubei/2016, CH/huaiyang/2015) with a part of reference PEDVs strains possessed a same specific 3-nt deletion in S2 gene (Fig. 1). Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of PEDV complete genomes showed that the PEDV S2\u25b3strain (CH/hubei/2016) was not grouped into same subgroup with the other reference PEDV strains possessed S2 3 nt deletion (Fig. 3). This phenomenon maybe explained by the fact that CH/hubei/2016 may result from the recombination between AH2012-12 (G2b) which had 3 nt-delection in S2 and CH-ZMDZY-11(G2a) (Fig. 4). Previous study revealed that recombination events in S1 gene between different PEDV groups may contribute to the genetic diversity of PEDV (Jarvis et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2016). Furthermore, Taiwan New PEDV variants have two potential recombination breakpoints in S1 and S2 (Chiou et al., 2017). All these fact indicted that recombination, insertion and deletion in the S gene may contribute to the genetic diversity of PEDV. However, because of only one complete PEDV S2\u25b3strain genomes was included into the phylogenetic analysis, further study need to explore the evolution position of PEDV S2\u25b3strains.",

This fact may result from the recombination between AH2012-12 (G2b) which had 3 nt-delection in S2 and CH-ZMDZY-11(G2a).
