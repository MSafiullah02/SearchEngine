Among patients with a diagnosis of back pain, in the postlockdown group, a significantly higher percentage of traumatic history (21.8% vs 4.9%, P < .001) as well as more cases requiring instrumental tests (28.1% vs 3.8%, P < .0001) was reported, thus suggesting a higher amount of accesses that really required urgent care during the epidemic emergency.",

Is the reduction of improper nonurgent accesses for back pain the only reason of this relevant difference between the 2 groups? The argument that the fear of infection inhibits patients from accessing the ED is obvious and needs to be taken into account. Nevertheless, pain is well-known to be one of the worsttolerated symptoms for patients and often becomes the cause of conflict with healthcare professionals, for requests for both immediate instrumental diagnostic tests and resolutive therapy. 1 Changes in daily routine after the lockdown, with less physical performance demands, could be an additional element to justify these results. That said, reduced mobility is also a predisposing cause for the onset of back pain in patients with degenerative spine disease. 2 Hence, a reliable interpretation of these data suggests that probably most of the patients improperly access EDs for back pain under normal circumstances, and could reasonably be managed in an outpatient setting.",
