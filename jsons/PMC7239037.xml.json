(8) states an inverse proportionality of the resistance to the square of the cylinder volume. If we consider the collapsible airway as a cylinder of fixed length and variable radius, and the air as a viscous Newtonian fluid with laminar flow within it, the above considerations apply. The widely used expression of RC is [16], [32]: (9)RCVC=Kc\u22c5VCmaxVC2According to Eq.

It is worth noting that Eq. (9) is not defined at VC=0 (where the pressure would be infinite), which means that complete airway collapse does not occur (Fig. 3[c]).",

The system response can be modified by setting the pulse amplitude (Amp), the duration of the pulse (tp) in each period (Tr), the phase delay (\u03c6) and the values of R and C. In particular, from Eq. (27) it follows that the solution P depends on the product R\u22c5C. So we can keep C constant and vary R.

The static and the elastic recoil of the lung are slightly different due to the resistance of lung tissue, which causes hysteresis of the dynamic elastic recoil of the lung. In Fig. 12[a], they are represented in a Campbell diagram (they are reversed in the pressure-volume plane) [6]. The pleural pressure exhibits hysteresis too (Fig. 12[a]).

These studies are useful, for example, to understand how to manage mechanical ventilation in ventilated COVID-19 patients. The experience gained during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the management of mechanical ventilation assistance in presence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is critical and changes from patient to patient depending on the side diseases afflicting the patient. The numerical simulator can be a useful tool to help medical doctors in the best management of devices that improve the patient\u2019s conditions.",
