The escalating global morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 has raised significant public health and economic concerns. As of April 20th, 2020, the PRC officially reported that the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached more than 88,000, while the total number of international cases surged to more than 2,400,000. Previous studies of similar viral respiratory diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have shown that the infected patients present with varying degrees of mental health problems even after being discharged from hospital, indicating that the mental status of these individuals should not be ignored (Cheng et al., 2004, Mak et al., 2009).",

Studies exploring the psychological effects during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak in China highlighted the anxiety and depression that emerged immediately after the epidemic (Cheng et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2005). At six months post-hospital discharge, approximately 25 percent of survivors experienced significant depression, and approximately 8.3 percent of survivors had adjustment disorder or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Wing and Ho, 2004). At 30 months post-SARS, 25 percent of the patients met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, while 15.6 percent had depressive disorders (Mak et al., 2009).",

Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic from February 10th to February 28th, 2020. Patients were recruited primarily from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (Shanghai, China), except for two patients from two other provinces (Sichuan and Hubei) who were willing to participate in a telephone interview. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they volunteered, were 18 years or older, and could respond to on-line survey questions. Using diagnostic criteria found in the the 4th version of \u201cDiagnosis and management program of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia\u201d released by the National Health Commission of The People's Republic of China (China., 2020), 103 patients diagnosed with mild cases of COVID-19 were included in this study. Peripheral blood samples were voluntarily obtained from hospitalized patients and all were found to contain viral nucleic acid consistent with COVID-19. None of the participants had lymphatic system disorders or malignant hematologic diseases, ensuring that the whole blood parameters were representative of typical baseline values. The 103 normal controls (NCs) were matched with the patients for age, gender, education level, and place of residence. None of the NCs had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspected for infection with COVID-19. NCs were recruited from local communities and volunteered to participate in our on-line survey. None of them reported a history of being diagnosed with any mental disorder, using diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases, tenth version (ICD-10).",

All were self-report scales with clear cutoff scores determining severity of symptoms. For PHQ-9, the total scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. The cutoff points used for the GAD-7 for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety were 5, 10, and 15, respectively. The PSS-10 consisted of two factors, with six negatively worded items (Items 1\u20133, 6, 9, 10) comprising the first factor and four positively worded items (Items 4, 5, 7, 8) comprising the second factor (Barbosa-Leiker et al., 2013b; Golden-Kreutz et al., 2004, Siqueira Reis et al., 2010). Specifically, the first factor represents negative feelings associated with stress, i.e., \u201cPerceived Helplessness\u201d, and the second factor reflects positive feelings counter to stress, \u201cPerceived Self-Efficacy\u201d (Roberti et al., 2006). The post-traumatic and stress-related symptoms were measured by PCL-5. The PCL-5 is a 20-item that evaluates DSM-5 PTSD symptoms caused by a currently distressing event in the past month (Wortmann et al., 2016). Four subscale scores can be calculated by summing items as follows: intrusions (Items 1\u20135), avoidance (Items 6\u20137), negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM) (Items 8\u201314), and alterations in arousal and reactivity (AR) (Items 15\u201320). The Chinese translated versions of the PHQ-9 (Wang et al., 2014), GAD-7 (Li et al., 2014), PSS-10 (Wang et al., 2011), and PCL-5 (Li et al., 2019) have been validated by previous studies.",

As for interactions between psychological distress and inflammatory biomarkers, the results revealed that depression levels were statistically directly related to the levels of CRP among patients with DS. Moreover, the more improvement of CRP level from baseline resulted in lower scores of PHQ-9 at the time of the survey. Finally, qualitative analysis revealed that the main factors related to a patient's perception of stress of being diagnosed with COVID-19 were the unexpectedness of the illness, loss of control (uncertainty) and sense of powerlessness, and post-traumatic symptoms. The latter included avoiding stressful experiences, blaming others, and strong negative feelings of fear, guilt, and helplessness.

            "text": "Given the profoundly serious nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, it was not surprising that a significant proportion of patients studied experienced depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. Of note, is that in 2003, at the height the SARS outbreak, severe psychological outcomes were also observed in infected patients. A survey conducted in Hong Kong at that time showed that hospitalized patients with SARS reported increased stress and negative psychological effects by the measure of PSS-10 (Chua et al., 2004), with a mean score of 20. Later, Cheng and the colleagues examined the psychological distress of SARS survivors, those who had been discharged from hospital, and found that about 35 percent of patients reported 'moderate to severe' or 'severe' ranges of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms (Cheng et al., 2004). Both studies included patients with the most severe type of SARS, with some admitted to ICU. Hence, our results may only be representative of patients who have less severe COVID-19 symptoms. A number of studies in China have investigated the mental status of COVID-19 patients (Bo et al., 2020), those COVID-19 negative (Liu et al., 2020, Qiu et al., 2020), and the healthcare workers (HCWs) (Lai et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020b). These studies consistently report that citizens of Wuhan or Hubei province were prone to higher levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms (Bo et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020) or psychological distress (Qiu et al., 2020) than other regions of China. Similar to our study, the nationwide on-line survey conducted by Qiu's group observed a gender effect on psychological outcomes (Qiu et al., 2020), with females showing significantly higher psychological distress than males. Two other investigations focusing on HCWs found a comparable proportion of participants with symptoms of depression (50.4 percent), anxiety (44.6 percent) as in our data (Lai et al., 2020). They also found that the general public and non-front-line nurses exhibited much higher vicarious traumatization than front-line nurses (Li et al., 2020b).",

In addition, the improvement on CRP concentration strongly correlated with levels of depression at the time of our observation. Although only cross-sectional psychological distress data was collected, the levels of depression seemed to be highly influenced by previous changes of inflammatory marker. This implies that the fluctuation of inflammation can dynamically influence the depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients. Previous research on patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV validate that the coronavirus might affect the central nervous system as it can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (Arabi et al., 2015, Tsai et al., 2005). Recent evidence has confirmed that the COVID-19 is also neurotropic and possibly invades the brain though the olfactory tract in the early stages of infection (Wu et al., 2020). A significant number of COVID-19 patients report a sudden loss of smell or taste as an early symptom, which may indicate anosmia and dysgeusia caused by COVID-19 (Giacomelli et al., 2020). Moreover, symptoms similar to intracranial infections such as headache, epilepsy, altered consciousness, and encephalitis among COVID-19 patients (Moriguchi et al., 2020) highlight the acute neuropsychiatric symptoms due to the virus.",

Our data, however, may be in support for the latter hypothesis. Studies have proven that COVID-19 infection triggers the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which could be related to neuropsychiatric symptoms (Troyer et al., 2020). The supporting evidence that Kuhlman and colleagues have revealed is the positive linkage between the increases in IL-6 and depressed mood and cognitive symptoms after receiving seasonal influenza vaccine (Kuhlman et al., 2018). Studies of cases of influenza encephalitis also demonstrate very little evidence that the neurological complications of influenza are due to the direct effects of the virus (Whitlock, 1982). Meanwhile, studies in major depression have documented the positive association between depression levels and inflammatory biomarkers (K\u00f6hler et al., 2017, Shafiee et al., 2017, Valkanova et al., 2013), once again supporting the immune-inflammatory theory for mood disorders.",

Inflammatory agents such as interleukins 6 and TNF-\u03b1 can enhance HPA activation (Besedovsky et al., 1991, Wang and Dunn, 1998). Therefore, the effective anti-inflammatory medications for COVID-19 may also be expected to relive the mood disturbance of patients. Since confounders such as medication and the hospitalization length of stay varied among our sample, future studies should focus on medication-free COVID-19 patients and follow the trajectories of inflammatory biomarkers and mental status to clarify this issue.",

            "text": "The study is also the first utilizing mix-methods to illustrate the perceived stress and stress-related symptoms amongst COVID-19 patients. These perceptions are rarely qualitatively reported using free form responses to open-ended questions from patients. Generally, patients\u2019 reports focused on their experiences after being diagnosed as COVID-19. Their perceptions of stress were related to the unexpectedness of the illness, loss of control (uncertainty), and a sense of powerlessness. Regarding the post-traumatic symptoms, patients reported a variety of avoidance behaviors and negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. These results are in line with several articles about the experiences of COVID-19 patients. They, too, suggest that patients may experience fear of the consequences of infection (Xiang et al., 2020), anxiety, depression, guilt, and anger (Kim and Su, 2020). The feeling of anger was not reported directly, which might be related to social desirability bias, but could be observed when patients reported themselves blaming others. Disengagement maladaptive coping strategies were identified from avoidance behaviors and patients denying any discomfort during the interview. Due to the limitation of sample number and the study design, it is not possible to determine the entire range of coping strategies the patients used and their mediating effects of responses to stress on the association between perceived stress and stress-related symptoms. Stigma and the uncertainty about the consequence of the infection are the two main causes of the negative feelings and thoughts among COVID-19 patients. As found in SARS-related stigma studies, media miscommunications of risk mitigation strategies and inconsistent health policy have augmented uncertainty toward sudden viral epi and pandemics (Lee et al., 2005) resulting in widespread fear and anxiety. Previous scientific studies have shown that the internalized HIV stigma was a strong predictor of depression (Swendeman et al., 2018). The influence of COVID-19 stigma on the mental status of patients is worth discussing in future studies.",
