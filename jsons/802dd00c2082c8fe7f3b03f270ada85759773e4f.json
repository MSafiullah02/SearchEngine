            "text": "At the time of paper submission, nearly two-thirds of the COVID-19 patients were not discharged, but now all 91 patients are fully discharged without death, including a 96-yearold woman. 2 Moreover, as at 24:00 on March 29 th in Zhejiang province, there were 1,255 laboratory-confirmed cases, 1,225 cases were discharged, 29 remain hospitalized and 1 case died. A total of 46,521 close contacts were tracked, and 2,827 people are still under medical observation. 3 The mortality rate between Wuhan and Zhejiang is quite different, where reported mortality rates range from 4.3 to 15% in Wuhan. 4-6 The longer median time for illness onset to hospital admission (9.84 days, however, the median time from visiting doctor to be confirmed was 1 days in Zhejiang), and shortage of health care workers and resources in the early stage, might have contributed to higher mortality in Wuhan. 7 The bilateral pneumonia in chest computed tomography (CT) scan was an important manifestation of COVID-19. In our study, 67.03% of patients had bilateral pneumonia in CT scan and none of the patients used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 2 Other studies have presented similar statistics. In Shanghai, which is geographically adjacent to Zhejiang, it was reported that 81.53% of COVID-19 patients had bilateral infiltrations in Shanghai. 8 In an earlier study of Zhejiang patients, Lian et al examined the medical records of 788 patients, at the time of their submission in early February most patients had yet to be discharged, none had died and they concluded that the symptoms of COVID-19 in Zhejiang province were relatively mild given the evidence they had at the time. 7, 9 This result might be due to well-resourced treatments administered in Zhejiang and Shanghai. The serious cases reported in Chen et al and Huang et al had high incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) could be due to that these were cases drawn from Wuhan, and some of the sample were taken from designated hospitals for severe pneumonia. Collectively, the research indicates that there are important differences in COVID-19 case fatality rate in different regions.",
