            "text": "One way to determine the type of virus is the identification of specific viral antigens in Western blot tests. For this purpose, the proteins of infected cells or virus particles which were previously pelleted by ultracentrifugation are separated by electrophoresis on a sodium dodecyl sulphate\u2013polyacrylamide gel. Their pattern and molecular masses can provide evidence for the type of virus. However, a final assignment is only possible serologically in the Western blot (Fig. 13.1). For this purpose, the separated proteins are transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane (actual Western blot) and then incubated with antisera containing immunoglobulins, which specifically react with the viral antigens of interest (primary antibody). Optimal are preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize defined epitopes of a viral protein. Sera from people who have withstood an infection with the corresponding virus type, and thus have produced specifically binding antibodies, can also be used. The nitrocellulose membranes are then treated with other so-called secondary antibodies, which are specific to the Fc regions of the primary antibody; e.g. with immunoglobulins from swine, which were inoculated with Fc regions of murine antibody molecules, and have developed an immune response against murine antibodies. Human antibodies are usually detected with rabbit immunoglobulins, which bind to the Fc regions of human IgG. The different enzymes necessary for the further detection reactions are covalently bound to the secondary antibody, e.g. horseradish peroxidase. These secondary antibodies interact with the antigen\u2013antibody complexes on the membranes, and in the next step, they are detected by adding the appropriate substrate, in this case diaminobenzidine. In the positive case, brownish protein bands arise (Fig. 13.1). Alternatively, the use of alkaline phosphatase for labelling produces a blue colour.\n",

            "text": "This variant of ELISA is employed for detecting viral proteins or particles as an alternative to the analytical Western blot. The test is usually performed in microtitre plates which contain 96 wells and are made from specially treated polystyrene. Murine monoclonal antibodies against a specific viral protein are bound to the surface of the plastic wells. Thereafter, suspensions which contain the virus in question or the viral proteins of interest are added the wells. If the relevant antigens are present, they will interact with the polystyrene-bound immunoglobulins. The antigen\u2013antibody complexes can be detected in the next step by addition of a further antibody, which binds to a different epitope of the same viral protein. These immunoglobulins are covalently conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, so the complex can be visualized by the addition of o-phenylenediamine as a soluble substrate. Photometric measurement of the intensity of this chromatic reaction makes possible a quantitative or semiquantitative determination of the viral antigen, which was present in the starting material (Fig. 13.2a). Examples of antigen ELISA applications in human medicine are infections with adenoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses in respiratory secretions and rotaviruses, adenoviruses and noroviruses in faeces. In veterinary medicine, antigen ELISA is used to detect rotaviruses, coronaviruses and parvoviruses in various animal species.\n",

These include, for example, the determination of reverse transcriptase activity, which is produced by human immunodeficiency viruses and is a component of the resulting virus particles (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). On the basis of the amount of this enzyme detected in the culture supernatant, the number of virus particles produced can be quantitatively determined. Other viruses are able to agglutinate erythrocytes. This haemagglutination capacity is found both in human pathogenic and in animal pathogenic viruses. It is associated with viral envelope proteins, and hence with the virions. Therefore, haemagglutination tests can be performed, among others, with paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16) as well as with flaviviruses, togaviruses, coronaviruses and parvoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20). Erythrocytes of appropriate species are used and mixed with the virus-containing suspensions; if red blood cells agglutinate, this indicates the presence of viruses. If the reaction can be inhibited by adding virus-specific antibodies, then this so-called haemagglutination-inhibition test allows determination of the virus type in the starting material. However, this method has become obsolete in routine diagnosis. Nowadays, the haemagglutination-inhibition test is only performed to evidence rubella-virus-specific antibodies in the context of statutory maternity care (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14).",

            "text": "Alternatively to proteins or enzyme activities, viral nucleic acids can be isolated from infected cells and specifically analysed by Southern blot, Northern blot or dot-blot tests. The purified DNA is cleaved by restriction enzymes. The resulting fragments are separated according to their size by agarose gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, DNA fragments are transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane (Southern blot); the same is done for detection of viral RNA (Northern blot), but omitting cleavage with restriction endonucleases. The DNA or RNA preparations can also be spotted directly on the membrane (dot blot). In the case of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules, a denaturation step is required to generate single-stranded molecules. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose or nylon membrane is incubated with labelled single-stranded DNA or RNA probes which are complementary to the nucleotide sequences examined and hybridize with them, forming double-stranded molecules (Fig. 13.4). Whereas the hybridization reaction was formerly done using mainly radioactive nucleotides containing 32P or 35S, non-radioactive systems are now predominantly used. Usually, modified nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA probes, which were labelled with biotin or digoxigenin molecules. After hybridization with the viral nucleic acids, the nitrocellulose or nylon membrane is incubated with streptavidin- or digoxigenin-specific antibodies. These reagents are covalently linked with enzymes that facilitate detection by a colorimetric reaction. Besides the afore-mentioned horseradish peroxidase (see Sect. 13.1.1.1.1), alkaline phosphatase conjugated reagents are increasingly used. Through incubation with X-phosphate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) and 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, a deep-purple precipitate is formed as evidence of enzyme activity. The intensity of the colour is directly proportional to the quantity of viral nucleic acid on the blot. Alternatively, the detection reaction can also be performed by chemiluminiscent reagents. As these methods are clearly inferior concerning sensitivity and specificity in comparison with modern polymerase chain reaction tests, these methods are only rarely employed for diagnostic purposes today.\n",

            "text": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows the amplification of very small quantities of viral genomes or transcripts directly from patient material. Theoretically and practically, it is possible to detect even a single nucleic acid molecule in the test sample. Initially, the viruses have to be broken up (e.g., using chaotropic agents) and the proteins that are present in the sample must be removed, as they can interfere with the subsequent reactions. They are normally degraded with proteases, or removed by phenol extraction and then precipitated and eliminated from the samples by centrifugation. Two oligonucleotides (primer) must be selected (15\u201320 nucleotides in length) that are complementary to each strand of the double-stranded DNA, flanking a region of 200\u2013400 bases (in real-time PCR also significantly shorter). The DNA is converted into single strands by heat denaturation (usually at 94 \u00b0C). Subsequently, the primers are added in high molar excess, and they hybridize with the respective DNA strands during annealing and form short double-stranded regions (annealing, usually at 50\u201360 \u00b0C). The reaction mixture also contains a heat-stable form of DNA polymerase (usually Taq polymerase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus) and the four nucleoside triphosphates dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP in appropriate concentrations and buffer systems. The hybridized oligonucleotides function as primers. They provide the necessary free 3\u2032-OH ends, onto which the Taq polymerase synthesizes the complementary DNA sequence (elongation or chain extension, usually at 72 \u00b0C). This step completes the first cycle. As a result, two double-stranded DNA molecules are present in the reaction mixture, which are separated again by a short heat denaturation step, which initiates the second cycle. During the following annealing, oligonucleotides hybridize again with the single strands and serve as a primer for the synthesis of further double strands: thus, the original DNA molecule has been amplified in a chain reaction to four double-stranded molecules. The cycles are repeated as often as desired, achieving a logarithmic amplification of nucleic acid molecules (2n, n is the number of cycles; Fig. 13.6). After about 30\u201340 cycles, the logarithmic amplification phase ends owing to depletion of reagents and enzyme; the PCR amplification products can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. For analytical purposes, such as cloning of amplification products, it is also possible to design the primers in such a way that they contain unique restriction enzyme cleavage sites. If the amplified double-stranded DNA is cleaved, the resulting fragment can be identified according to its size after separation of the reaction mixture by agarose gel electrophoresis, or by a subsequent Southern blot assay; or it can be processed further. To increase the diagnostic sensitivity, but also the specificity, two PCRs can be combined by a second, inwardly shifted primer pair (nested PCR). Since DNA is very stable over long periods of time, its sequences can be detected in older and even in fixed tissue samples. Therefore, viruses can be detected in very old, formaldehyde-conserved samples and even in embalmed mummies.\n",

This is followed by the amplification reactions described above. Both reactions can be done in the same reaction tube and using identical buffer conditions. Taq polymerase can also be modified so that it can catalyse both reactions. With use of appropriate control standards it is also possible to determine the quantity of nucleic acid in the starting material, e.g. in sera. A disadvantage is often the high sensitivity of the PCR method, particularly nested PCR: since it is possible to amplify even a single DNA molecule, minimal contamination in the reaction mixture is sufficient to generate false-positive results. Besides this carry-over contamination, a primary contamination can occur by infiltration within the laboratory when very high amounts of virus are present in the material (e.g. norovirus or parvovirus B19). This risk is especially high in diagnostic laboratories, where the pertinent materials are routinely handled. Therefore, depending on the PCR application, all solutions, buffers and reaction mixtures which are used for the PCR must be prepared and pipetted in separate rooms (spatial compartmentalization); furthermore, negative controls have to be performed in all tests to indicate possible contamination.",

For this purpose, the DNA or RNA molecules are amplified as described above. A defined set of single-stranded probes which have a length of 25\u201340 nucleotides and are complementary to sequences of the amplified regions are added to the reaction mixture. These sequence-specific probes are labelled with a fluorescent group at the 5\u2032 terminus (e.g. 6-carboxyfluorescein). Conversely, they carry a different chemical group at the 3\u2032 end (e.g. 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) which suppresses the fluorescence of 6-carboxyfluorescein. Prerequisite for this quenching effect is that the two groups are located close to each other, e.g. at the two ends of each probe (fluorescence energy resonance transfer technology). If viral genomes are present in the sample, then the nucleotides of the probe are degraded by the exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase during the polymerization process. This step leads to separation of the two fluorescent groups. The quenching effect is abolished by this step and the fluorescence of 6-carboxyfluorescein can be measured in real time. The more viral nucleic acid was in the starting material, the higher is the fluorescence intensity. Common procedures have a logarithmic amplification efficiency of six to eight logarithmic magnitudes. With use of several primer pairs and differentially labelled probes, various amplification products can also be detected specifically and quantitatively in a single assay (multiplex PCR). Thus, internal controls are possible for checking both the DNA extraction efficiency and possible internal inhibitions. Another advantage of real-time PCR is the significantly reduced risk of end-product contamination.",

However, viral proteins are preferentially used today, and they are produced using genetic engineering methods. For this purpose, viral antigens are chosen against which virus-type-specific antibodies are produced during infection and that are also conserved and hence not easily mutable. Usually, they are viral structural proteins. The genes that code for these proteins are cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli or yeast under the control of bacterial promoters. These bacteria produce large amounts of the respective viral proteins, which can be purified and used as antigens in Western blotting or ELISA. This approach has proven to be cheaper and less hazardous than the cultivation of large amounts of infectious pathogens. Is also known that antibodies are regularly produced against specific epitopes in the course of infection; these protein regions can be synthesized chemically as peptides and used as antigens in ELISA.",

            "text": "In addition to intracellular staining for detection of cytokines in the cells by FACS analyses, the tetramer test is used when specific T cells which recognize viral peptides in complex with MHC class I antigens are to be detected. The procedure relies upon recombinantly produced MHC class I or MHC class II proteins which are linked with biotin molecules in their carboxy-terminal domains. After their purification, the MHC class I protein preparations are incubated with \u03b22-microglobulin and peptides (in the case of MHC class II proteins only with peptides) that are derived from the viral antigens against which the T lymphocytes react that one wants to detect. In the next step, the peptide\u2013MHC\u2013biotin complexes bind to avidin, which is labelled with fluorescent dyes (e.g. fluorescein or phycoerythrin) and has four binding sites for biotin. The fluorescent avidin\u2013biotin\u2013peptide\u2013MHC complexes are then incubated with purified T lymphocytes, which were isolated from the blood of the subjects examined (Fig. 13.7). If T cells whose T-cell receptors specifically bind to the MHC\u2013peptide complexes are present in the cell preparation because of a past infection, then the fluorescent complexes will bind to the surface of T cells, which can be quantitatively detected by FACS analyses.\n",

In this procedure, the isolated lymphocytes are incubated with the antigens in question or with antigen-presenting cells. Lymphocytes, which recognize the antigen in question, begin to proliferate. Lymphocyte proliferation can be detected by addition of 3H-thymidine to the culture medium and can be followed by measuring the incorporation of the radioactive nucleotide into the cellular DNA. Alternatively, secreted proteins (such as certain interleukins), which are released as a result of lymphocyte recognition, can be detected by ELISA in the culture supernatant or by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot tests at the level of individual cells.",

If the detection of interleukins or chemokines is desired, then antibodies which specifically bind to the respective proteins are attached to the polystyrene material of microtitre plates; if specific antibodies are to be detected, then the microtitre plates are coated with the corresponding proteins. The lymphocytes to be examined, which were isolated from the blood of subjects, are added to the wells of the microtitre plate so that they form a thin layer on the floor. During an incubation period at 37 \u00b0C, the lymphocytes secrete the products in question, which bind to the interleukin-specific antibodies or to the protein antigens on the floor of the microtitre plate. Subsequently, the lymphocytes are removed and the plates are washed. A semisolid agar layer is added containing dye-labelled antibodies, which recognize the complexes formed. Each of the relevant antibodies or interleukin-producing lymphocytes is depicted in a perceptible colour point on the floor of the plate. Counting is usually performed by appropriate automated camera and evaluation systems.",

            "text": "In contrast to the general detection of bacterial infections, e.g. by amplification of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA, no general screening test is available for detecting viral infections. This implies searching specifically for each potential pathogen. With regard to practicality and costs, the ability to detect multiple viruses using a single PCR would be a solution. Ideally, all possible pathogens for diarrhoea or meningitis could be detected in a single assay. The principle of multiplex PCR takes this into account, as several primer pairs and probes can be mixed together. However, this approach is generally associated with a loss of sensitivity. An elegant solution is when a conserved region can be amplified with a primer pair, in which the determination of subtypes or genotypes is possible by different probes with a sufficient number of sequence differences. This principle has been successfully applied in determining the high-grade and low-grade malignant subtypes of human papillomaviruses. On the basis of microarray chip technology, efforts are currently being made to develop miniaturized chip tests for viral diagnostics.",

            "text": "In the treatment of persistent viral infections, such as with HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C viruses, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus, we are confronted with the problem of the development of resistant viruses. It is often important to search specifically for the presence of well-known mutations which determine the respective resistance. In the case of HIV, phenotypic tests were initially applied in which the virus infecting the patient was cultivated in cell culture and examined for sensitivity to the corresponding drugs. Later, it was attempted to insert the tested genes in recombinant viruses. But, it is more practical to determine the predominant genotype of the virus, e.g. by PCR and subsequent sequencing. In the case of HIV, the genes encoding the reverse transcriptase complex and the viral protease are examined. Owing to the increasing prevalence of already resistant viruses in new infections, this can also be important before the first therapy.",

            "text": "In recent years, biosensors have been increasingly discussed and tested as rapid and sensitive test systems for the detection of various classes of substances and molecules. The immunosensors allow the measurement of specific antigen\u2013antibody complexes; they are based on different principles, which can be addressed herein only briefly. For use as chemical sensors in liquids, such as sera, volume resonators seem to be particularly appropriate today. These include oscillating quartz crystals, which (depending on the test principle) are coated with antigenic proteins or monoclonal antibodies on a specially treated surface. If an alternating electric voltage is applied to these quartz crystals, the crystal becomes excited, resulting in elastic oscillations, whose amplitude reaches a maximum when the electrical frequency matches one of the natural mechanical frequencies of the respective quartz crystal. These oscillations can be measured by appropriate measuring systems. If a quartz crystal coated with antigens is placed in a solution containing specifically binding antibodies, then they bind to its surface and alter its mass. This changes the oscillation frequency, indicating positive antibody detection. Besides these piezoelectric immunosensors, attempts are being made to develop measuring techniques that work similarly to the potentiometric electrodes of pH metres. In this case, the objective is to determine the potential change that arises owing to the antigen\u2013antibody complex formation on a thin, equilibrated silica gel layer on the surface of the pH glass membrane. Ion-sensitive field-effect transistors are a subgroup of potentiometric immunosensors; they have the fastest response time (only a few seconds) among all the systems mentioned, thus making possible extremely fast measurements.",

            "text": "Fig. 13.5: Immunochromatography (rapid test for detection of viruses in patient material). This test is aimed at detecting viruses in liquid patient materials, such as serum, sputum and stool samples. Membranes are used (nitrocellulose or similar) which are coated with specific reagents in different sections (windows). Sample application window: large quantities of gold beads (diameter 20 \u03bcm) contain covalently bound IgG antibodies on the surface, which bind specifically to epitopes on the surface proteins of the pertinent virus. Results window: IgG molecules are covalently bound to the membrane, and can bind to the same or different epitopes of the virus to be detected. Control window: this contains anti-IgG antibodies covalently bound to the membrane. The test principle is as follows. The membrane is incubated with the biopsy material in the area of the application window and placed in a container with buffer solution. If the material contains the virus in question, then the virus will bind to the IgG antibodies on the gold beads. Virus\u2013IgG gold bead complexes and unloaded beads migrate with the buffer front into the results window. IgG antibodies, which are covalently linked to the membrane, bind to free epitopes on the surface of the virus. In this way, the migration of virus\u2013IgG gold beads is stopped, and they form a golden (dark) band within the results window. The unloaded (virus-free) IgG gold beads migrate further with the buffer front into the control window, where their migration is stopped, as they react with the immobilized anti-IgG antibodies. As a result, a second band arises in the control window. From the strength of the bands and their ratio, it is possible to infer the amount of virus in the starting material. If the test material does not contain any viruses, only one band will be formed in the control window",
