By contrast, it has been consistently shown that early allergen sensitization becomes a major risk factor for wheezing exacerbations and hospitalizations for wheezing after age 3 (4, 5, 11) . It is thought that IgE-mediated inflammation found in most children with persistent symptoms of asthma is a key factor in causing lung function impairment and airway remodeling. However, identification of children at risk for development of persistent symptoms remains a challenge. A stringent clinical index has been defined for children with persistent wheezing during the first 3 yr of life that predicted subsequent asthma. This asthma predictive index included either a parental history of asthma, the presence of allergic eczema in the child, or two of three \u00d4minor\u00d5 criteria (eosinophilia, wheezing without colds, and allergic rhinitis) (19) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 513, "end": 516, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 698, "end": 701, "text": "(4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 702, "end": 704, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 705, "end": 708, "text": "11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although genetic factors have been shown to play a role in both allergic sensitization and asthma, evidence suggests that events taking place between 2 and 3 yr of age might be crucial determinants for the development of asthma. Treating children at this age with inhaled corticosteroids may alter the course of the disease and prevent loss of lung function, and this possibility is currently under investigation (20) . Previously, results of the Childhood Asthma Management Program study (CAMP study) have failed to demonstrate an effect of prolonged treatment of 5-12-year-old children with asthma with low-tomoderate doses of inhaled budesonide in preventing decrease in lung function (21) , however, in that study it is possible that treatment may have started too late. Alternative strategies have focused on manipulating the environment of high-risk individuals as an attempt to reduce the prevalence of asthma in children. At present, six primary prevention controlled studies are in progress (22) . The longest follow-up reported has been from the Isle of Wight study. Stringent allergen avoidance measures instituted at birth, aimed at reducing exposure to HDM and preventing food sensitization, resulted in a significant decrease in asthma symptoms and sensitization to allergens at age 8. Likewise, outcomes of the Canadian Primary Prevention Study on high-risk infants have been reported at age 2 yr, showing that intervention comprising avoidance of mite, pet allergens and environmental tobacco smoke, as well as dietary regimen resulted in reduction of asthma in the intervention group (23) . In the present study, children were sensitized primarily to HDM and cockroach and this is in keeping with previous studies carried out in our area, evaluating children 2 yr and older with acute wheezing or those attending allergy specialty clinics (18, 24) . A strong relationship between exposure and sensitization has been demonstrated for mites and cockroach (25, 26) . Our results suggest that the high rates of sensitization to these allergens may be due to the fact that 74% and 37.5% of children in the present study were exposed to high levels of mite and cockroach allergens in their homes, respectively, similarly to other reports from Brazil (27, 28) .

The small number of patients in our cohort may have caused the estimates of incident asthma and risk factors, including respiratory viral infections, to be underpowered. Classification of children as persistent wheezers in the present study was based on criteria described in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (2) . Although our evaluation has been carried out at an earlier age as compared to the Tucson study, results of this long-term prospective investigation (2) have revealed that children who presented frequent wheezing in their first 3 yr of life were more likely to develop persistent symptoms throughout childhood and to have lower pulmonary function by ages 6 and 13, as compared to those who had not wheezed in the first 3 yr of life.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 600, "end": 603, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 754, "end": 757, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we have found that a high proportion of children who wheeze in the first 2 yr of life continue to wheeze after 2 yr.
