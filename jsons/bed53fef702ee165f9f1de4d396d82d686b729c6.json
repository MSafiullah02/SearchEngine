To determine if there is a real health risk, well-designed scientifically valid studies must be performed. Although much attention has focused on sick building syndrome, chemical sensitivities, and mycotoxicosis, there actually is very little evidence that these conditions have an adverse effect on human health. In contrast, real health issues have been shown to exist regarding indoor air triggers of allergies and asthma. Outdoor allergens are difficult to avoid because the pollen grains we encounter outdoors, which are the size that can cause allergies, are windborne and can travel for miles. However, indoor allergens can cause severe allergic symptoms and may also have a priming effect on an individual's susceptibility to simultaneous or subsequent exposure of other outdoor allergens. Therefore, it is important to minimize exposure to indoor allergens. Determination of individual susceptibility can be paired with knowledge of the patient's indoor exposure pattern to produce a customized management plan of avoidance, which can be used in conjunction with pharmacological treatment of allergies and asthma, as well as immunotherapy.",

Coinciding with this change in lifestyle, there has been an increase in the prevalence of allergies and asthma. Several theories have been proposed for this increase, including a more mobile lifestyle and a switch from a predominantly T-helper (Th)1-based immune system to a Th2-based immune system. Theories attempting to explain this switch include the hygiene hypothesis, which is discussed later. Additionally, the role of changes in building style cannot be ignored, but the data has often been misleading. Houses have become more airtight, often with poor ventilation systems. Most homes have ventilation properties of only 0.2 to 0.5 air changes per hour. In addition to allergies, other complaints attributed to indoor air quality have surfaced, and different components of air have been blamed for these health issues. Although many of these complaints have not been substantiated by well-designed or well-executed clinical trials, the mere occurrence of symptoms in a group of individuals in a single building has given rise to conditions of mass hysteria, as in the case of sick building syndrome (SBS).",

Nonetheless, indoor air quality is an important issue and embodies both truths and myths.

            "text": "Even before the concept of allergies was developed, there were descriptions regarding the importance of avoiding substances that caused illness. In the 16th century, the Italian physican Gerolamo Cardano was summoned to the home of John Hamilton, the Archbishop of Saint Andrews, who was suffering from respiratory complaints that were believed to result from tuberculosis. After observing the Hamilton's lifestyle and environment for 6 wk, the doctor tried various dietary and supportive modes of therapy but coincidentally recommended that the Archbishop switch his feather bed for one made of unspun silk. Hamilton complied, and his symptoms disappeared. Of course, the source of Hamiton's symptoms is a matter of speculation, but more than likely, it was the feathers. This marked the first historical recording of a successful clinical attempt to decrease symptoms by avoidance measures (1) . The terms allergen and allergy were coined by Baron Clemens von Pirquet in 1903 (2) . From the Greek, the terms translate into \"altered response.\" In 1913, one of the first clinical descriptions of an allergy to an indoor allergen was presented by William Philipps Dunbar, who wrote of the case of a woman who developed itching in the eye after touching the fur of a cat with her hand and then touching her own cheek (1) . The clinical importance of exposure to airborne substances was first proposed in the Western world in a 1954 article by Brown on the asthmogenic effects of odors and fumes (3) .",

Installation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to generate a comfortable environment has also led to an additional source for airborne allergenic particles (4) . Condensation is a byproduct of operating HVAC systems, thus allowing for mold growth and generating an additional source of allergens.

            "text": "There are five ways that indoor air contaminants can affect the health of an individual. These include toxic effects, irritant effects, infectious diseases, allergic disorders, and psychological effects. Toxic effects have been described to result from gaseous products or particulates, such as SO 2 , NO 2 , environmental tobacco smoke, asbestos, formaldehyde, and ozone. There are also many other VOCs, which are released from cleaning solutions, new carpeting, electronic equipment, paints and glue, building materials, printed material, and heating equipment. These compounds can be categorized as alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, benzenes, terpenes, acrylates, and xylenes. Although one might think that each compound or class of compound exerts different clinical effects in humans, the clinical effects of these compounds generally are discussed as a group; this again casts doubt on the validity of adverse health effects occurring as a result of exposure to VOCs. Because many of these compounds coexist in normal building air, it is impossible and impracticable to isolate the clinical effects of a single substance. Therefore, identifying a cause-and-effect relationship is extremely difficult. In addition to \"toxic\" effects, these agents can also cause irritant effects, which are poorly defined complaints that are usually related to the eyes, throat, nasal passages, and airways. The etiology or pathogenesis for these effects is not clear, but toxic and irritant effects have primarily been blamed for SBS.",

Other viral infections, including those caused by various strains of influenza, also have been associated with outbreaks of SBS (18, 19) . Last year, in the midst of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Asia, the spread of the SARS virus (a coronavirus) was demonstrated as the cause of a cluster of 187 cases from the Amoy Gardens Housing complex in Hong Kong (20) . It was shown that the airborne route was the probable mode of transmission. A summary of infectious diseases associated with SBS is shown in Table 2 . NO 2 may play a role in asthma exacerbations. In a study of 16 subjects with mild asthma and allergies to birch pollen, those exposed to a combination of NO 2 and the allergen in a controlled allergen chamber environment experienced a greater drop in forced expiratory ventilation for 1 min compared to those exposed to ambient air and allergen (21) . Unfortunately, although the results were statistically significant, the number of subjects evaluated in this study was small. A more recent prospective study of 114 children was conducted. The relationship between exposure to high levels of NO 2 was investigated in the context of severity of virally induced asthma exacerbations. In this study, high levels (>14 \u00b5g/m 3 ) of NO 2 appeared to cause a higher severity of symptoms in virally induced asthma (22) .",

In the case of gases, molecules are admixed with other gaseous substances in air, and thus are able to virtually penetrate wherever \"air\" can penetrate. In the case of particulate matter, penetration of the particle into the respiratory tract depends on the size of the particle. Mold spores range from 5 to over 100 \u00b5m in length, whereas most other indoor allergens are carried on particles that are between 2 and 15 \u00b5m in diameter. Pollen grains are generally between 10 and 40 \u00b5m in diameter. Smaller particles have the capability of deeper penetration into the respiratory tract. Most particles greater than 5 \u00b5m will not enter the lower respiratory tract, and their effects are a result of local nasal passage or conjunctival stimulation. There are two possible mechanisms by which larger particles can cause asthma: a) the particles carrying the allergenic protein are fragmented, leading to smaller actual particle sizes, and/or b) the particles act on tissues further up in the airway, but cellular and chemical factors generate a systemic allergic reaction leading to lower respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing and wheezing (23, 24) .",

It is possible that most mold spores in the air may be fragmented as well. The size of common allergic indoor air contaminants is shown in Table 4 . The conduits that are responsible for the interaction between site of exposure and location of a clinical response include the circulatory system and the nervous system. Factors involved in this interaction are the classical cellular and hormonal mediators of the acute allergic reaction, including cytokines, neurotropins, eosinophils, leukotrienes, T lymphocytes, adhesion molecules, antigen presenting cells, and components of the vascular epithelium and bone marrow (24) .

Other cellular effects of mycotoxins include inhibition of protein synthesis and DNA synthesis (45) (46) (47) , bone marrow suppression in mice (48) , and induction of apoptosis of human leukaemia cells (49) . Mycotoxins have also been shown to have effects on production of lung surfactant by rabbit type II alveolar cells (50) . However, there have not been any placebo-controlled, double-blind studies showing any direct evidence of adverse effects on lung function in humans exposed to mycotoxins. Moreover, with the exception of allergies and asthma, there are no proven, long-term, ill effects from exposure to mold (51).",

In this case, only one avoidance measure was studied, and this was actually ineffective in reducing exposure. Dust mite exposure can be reduced when a total management plan of avoidance is used (56, 57) . Additionally, different allergens require different avoidance measures. Avoidance measures should be specifically targeted to remedy actual detectable high levels of environmental allergens. Therefore, evaluation of the environment is an important component of an allergy or asthma management plan. Additional information regarding a patient's individual atopic risk or sensitization status can also help dictate implementation of avoidance measures.

Early avoidance of food and environmental allergens has been studied as a means to decrease the risk of developing allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis (58) . Studies have shown that exclusive breastfeeding with delayed introduction of solid foods and formula can delay the onset of dust mite sensitization (59) . As to animal allergens, cat exposure at an early age was associated with an increased risk of sensitization to cat allergen, whereas dog exposure had no effect on sensitization to dog allergen. Cat and dog ownership was associated with a reduced risk of sensitization to other allergens (60) . In fact, there may be a bell-shaped relationship between sensitization risk for cat allergen and cat exposure. In this case, moderate exposure to cat allergen may pose the greatest risk for sensitization. In the case of dust mite and cockroach allergen, early exposure is associated with higher risks of sensitization to dust mite and cockroach, respectively. It is clear that although there are numerous studies attempting to identify factors related to exposure risk, there are significant obstacles to such studies. Limitations and obstacles include the elimination of confounding variables, accurate measurement of exposure levels, identification of similar and different characteristics of subjects, validity, and definition of parameters such as \"ownership,\" and so forth. It is likely that risk of allergic sensitization may be spe- cific to the individual allergen studied and may also be dependent on as yet undefined host phenotypes. Currently, there is sufficient data to continue recommendations that high-risk individuals practice avoidance as a means to primary prevention of atopy.",

This generally is done using skin testing or radioallergosorbent testing. Once the sensitivities of a patient have been determined, the primary advice to the patient is to avoid exposure to those particular allergens. However, this advice is given in general fashion, without ever truly knowing what the patient may have been exposed to. Additional treatment may be provided in the form of medications (mainly nonsedating antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids) and immunotherapy. A missing link in the management of allergies and asthma has been the evaluation and identification of allergens in the patient's environment. Outdoor daily or weekly pollen counts now are reported in the media in selected cities and towns, but these data are based on a single sampling, and variability in counts exists depending on weather, time of day, and surrounding vegetation. Similarly, the levels of allergens in the indoor environment depend on the building construction, local weather, living conditions, occupant habits, and so on. Although there are currently no standards or uniform programs for testing indoor environments, indoor allergen measurements would be a useful adjunct in the treatment of patients with allergies or asthma, because one could correlate exposure with sensitivity and clinical symptoms. Achievement of the goal of reducing exposure then could be matched with the patient's specific sensitivities as well as his or her ongoing symptom monitoring. In the case of asthma, less exposure may lead to decreased inflammation, leading to a decrease in long-term airway remodeling.",

Atopy is not inherited in Mendelian fashion; however, the strong genetic influence is supported by the significant family histories of atopy that are elicited during history and physicals of patients. In fact, when one parent is atopic, there is a 48% chance that an offspring will be atopic. This rate rises to about 70% when both parents are atopic.

This is similar to the scenario by which vaccination to an infectious agent generates a response that includes, but is not limited to, the production of IgG for protection against subsequent exposures. However, there may also be immunological characteristics of a genetically susceptible individual that predispose certain individuals to release either Th1 or Th2 cytokines, leading to an atopic state. Initially, it was believed that certain environmental factors encountered by an individual early in life affected the balance in the development of Th1 and Th2 responses. The prenatal or neonatal immune system is innately and predominantly driven by Th2. A predominantly Th1-based immune system develops as a result of microbial stimuli to fulfill the need of the host to protect itself against such stimuli. In the absence of this microbial pressure, the immune system fails to switch from a Th2-driven system to a balanced Th1-Th2 system. Atopy is the clinical result of a predominantly Th2based immune system.",

Certainly, the way an individual reacts to exposure is unique to that individual.

One frequently discussed isssue deals with whether or not exposure to one or more allergens increases the likelihood of sensitization to other allergens. In early childhood, this seems to be true. A Swedish study showed that exposure to cat allergen early in life protected against asthma and birch sensitivity (75) . In an adult study, current cat ownership in adults seemed to protect against cat and dog allergen sensitivity but not against dust mite or pollen sensitization (76) .",

A novel T-cell immunoglobulin domain-mucin domain gene family, designated the TIM gene family, was observed to encode transmembrane proteins expressed by CD4 T cells (77) . The TIM family of genes was shown to regulate development of atopy. Particularly, the variants of the TIM-1 gene were shown to pro- tect against atopy in humans but only in humans who had been previously infected with HAV. The TIM-1 gene product also functions as the cellular receptor for HAV, so it is proposed that the HAV may activate T cells through its interaction with the receptor, thereby facilitating differentiation to a predominantly Th2-based immune system. In the future, our understanding of the interaction between asthma genes and exposure to viral infections and the effect on the development of atopy may play an important role in determining intervention and management strategies for the prevention and treatment of asthma, respectively.",

Therefore, exposure standards have been difficult to establish, and the regulation of indoor air and building components has been fraught with confusion and inaccuracies (4) . The past issues played out in courtrooms and the media first concerning SBS and then mold toxicosis has clearly placed a blemish on the science of indoor air. Our knowledge of the genetics and pathology of asthma and allergies has increased greatly in the past 30 yr, and there is no evidence that suggests a change in our recommendations regarding avoidance to people with allergies. Avoidance measures remain an important facet to the treatment of allergies and asthma. The recommendations for patients already sensitized, in terms of relief of symptoms and improvement of pulmonary function in asthmatic patients, is to avoid contact with allergens to which the patient is already sensitized. The levels of allergens that may cause worsening of symptoms in most patients with asthma is known for the nonmold indoor allergens, including dust mite, cat, dog, cockroach, and so forth. The level of mold allergens that may lead to worsening asthma or allergy symptoms depends on the individual's atopic predisposition. When treating a patient for allergic disorders such as allergies and asthma, it is not just the patient that must be evaluated but also his or her environment. Environmental evaluation is important in matching an individual's sensitivity with their environmental exposures. In the future, this type of \"targeted\" approach to the treatment of allergies and asthma will contribute to a better and more customized plan of management for the patient with allergies or asthma.",
