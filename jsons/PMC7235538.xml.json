Since in Italy (as well as in many countries) most COVID-19 patients are followed at home by primary care physicians, they will be asked from participating centers to refer them all COVID-19 patients with possible neurologic manifestations. The duration of the recruiting period will be 6 months, starting from March 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020, with a mixture of retrospective and prospective data collection, and the follow-up period will be of 6 months (until February 28, 2021).",

However, so far, no prospective study has been designed to intercept any possible neurologic manifestation occurring in COVID patients, either in severe hospitalized patients, or in mild or asymptomatic patients who, in Italy, are invited to stay at home. The main aim of this retrospective-prospective observational study, therefore, is to collect the maximum number of patients with neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, to describe their temporal relation with COVID-19 symptomatology and to follow them for up to 6 months. Indeed, neurologists need to pay close attention to COVID-19 neurological manifestations, which may have contributed to their demise, especially for those with severe infections. Furthermore, when seeing patients with neurological manifestations in this pandemic period, neurologists should consider COVID-19 infection as a possible concomitant pathology, so to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and prevention of transmission.",

The eCRF we provide is quite accurate to detect also mild neurological symptoms such as hypogeusia and hyposmia, both seeming to be particularly represented also in early stage of the disease, representing a possible clinical screening tool to further orientate testing of pauci-symptomatic individuals [2]. A large part of Italian patients is followed at home by primary care physicians, for this reason, we also planned to recruit these patients, referred by primary care physicians to participating neurologists.",

It would be better, at this point, to avoid collection of data from small case series and plan multicenter studies, to include a large number of patients on a national basis, under the auspices of the Italian Society of Neurology (SIN). This preliminary analysis will represent a useful referral for both the neurological scientific community and the authorities, to further dissect the different aspects of the neuroCOVID-19, addressing further researches in areas of specific interest. Close monitoring of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 may also provide indications for specific diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures of unpredictable benefit in subsets of COVID-19 patients with various central or peripheral neurological involvement.",

The study may also largely contribute in shedding light on the pathogenesis of the neurological complications in COVID-19 that is probably complex, involving a currently unknown set of interactions between viral properties, tissue susceptibility, and host immune response even in the nervous system. The study may also add in recognizing that some patients that recover from COVID-19 may complain of lasting neurological sequelae that may have been overlooked at the time of acute illness. Therefore, long-term follow-up for neurological deficits may be considered as essential in Italy and the rest of the world. Furthermore, the gained sensitivity of the new generations of neurologists in the residency programs will be a contributing factor in further defining the multiple neuroclinical features of COVID-19 [14].",
