They are responsible for episodes of common cold in humans worldwide (Annan et al., 2016; Graat et al., 2003; Mackay et al., 2012; Owusu et al., 2014; van Elden et al., 2004). Depending on the study setting, up to 20% of tests in individuals with respiratory disease yielded evidence of acute infection with these viruses (Annan et al., 2016; Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Berkley et al., 2010; Dijkman et al., 2012; Fielding, 2011; Gaunt et al., 2010; Larson et al., 1980; Walsh et al., 2013). HCoV-229E was first isolated in 1967 and shares only 65% nucleotide identity with the other human alphacoronavirus, HCoV-NL63. The latter was first isolated in 2003 from a 7-months-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis (Hamre and Procknow, 1966; van der Hoek et al., 2004). HCoV-OC43 is already known since the 1960s, whereas HCoV-HKU1 was discovered only in 2005 in a 71-year-old man with pneumonia treated in Hong Kong (McIntosh et al., 1967; Woo et al., 2005).",

It also implicates genetic restrictions separating species by referring to a species as \u201ca replicating lineage.\u201d However, only for some virus groups have the genetic basis of speciation\u2014limited fitness of recombinants\u2014been used to systematically delimit species. Habitat or niche separation leads to physical, but not necessarily genetic reproductive isolation. In classical approaches to species definition in animals, populations living in disconnected habitats continue to belong to one same species as long as they can generate fit and fertile progeny. In some viral taxa including the CoVs, genetic distance criteria have been established, using data that at least partly consider the empirical capability of viral lineages to form viable recombinants (de Groot et al., 2012a, de Groot et al., 2012b). Genetic species delimitation criteria enable us to discover cases in which viral species exist over several host systems. We can then identify those host species that contain a higher genetic viral diversity, and thereupon derive source attributions in zoonotic or evolutionary scenarios. Adequate comparisons of genetic diversity can only be conducted as long as the compared viruses belong to one same species. This is because the biology of separated species\u2014even if they belong to closely related phylogenetic clades\u2014may be so different that genetic diversity could have developed at considerably different pace. Consequently, information on ecological niche\u2014often a particular host species\u2014should not be used as a leading criterion for the classification of viral species.",

            "text": "Several zoonotic spillover infections or epidemics in humans are explained by the involvement of intermediate hosts, creating additional complexity when analyzing multihost species of viruses. In cases in which the virus establishes long-term endemicity in intermediate hosts, intermediate hosts can become natural hosts according to the above definition. The viruses existing in the primordial host and the intermediate host can both belong to the same species, but the viral source population involved in zoonotic transmission may be disconnected from that in the primordial host. For clarity of source implications, we will therefore refer to source species in zoonotic transmission processes as zoonotic sources, irrespective of whether they also fulfill all criteria of natural hosts. A prominent example is rabies virus that has highly diversified conspecifics in bats but is enzootic in dogs to such a degree that dogs are considered zoonotic sources and natural hosts at the same time, but not primordial hosts. The transmission of Nipah and Hendra virus (belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae) from bats to humans involves swine or horses that act as zoonotic sources but are not considered natural hosts because they are only accidentally infected (Eaton et al., 2006). Intermediate hosts may act as zoonotic sources for dead-end hosts not only because they close gaps of contact between species, but also because they could make the virus transmissible by intermediary adaptation (Caron et al., 2015; Plowright et al., 2015). Intermediary adaptation was strongly suspected for the SARS-CoV whose zoonotic source is in carnivores, in which the virus would have evolved human-compatible receptor tropism (Graham and Baric, 2010; Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2004). However, viruses directly infecting human cells have later been found in rhinolophid bats, the primordial natural host of the species SARS-related CoV (Drexler et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015). Of note, these viruses are conspecific with SARS-CoV but do not fall into the viral clade that was transferred from carnivores to humans and initiated the epidemic. The actual ancestors of the SARS-CoV may continue to exist in the natural reservoir, as new virus variants are continuously formed in the reservoir. If the natural host (e.g., a bat species) harbors different virus populations of the same species, recombination contributes new variants. The proofreading and repair mechanisms typical in CoVs may aid the survival and selection of recombinant viruses in populations (Eckerle et al., 2010; Hanada et al., 2004; Minskaia et al., 2006). Indeed, recombination between the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike gene has been discussed as one of the major mechanism involved in the emergence of human SARS-CoV strains from bat and civet ancestors (Eckerle et al., 2010). On the other hand, ongoing recombination maintains stability of the gene pool of a defined virus species by shuffling sequences and thus limiting divergence processes (Lukashev, 2010).",

Provided that receptor distribution is similar in donor and recipient host, these gradual changes are not expected to cause general changes of disease pattern. Nevertheless, the emergence of coronaviral diseases has also involved drastic changes including switches in tissue tropism by combinations of gene deletion and recombination. For instance, in TEGV of swine, deletions in the spike protein have been associated with changed tropism. TEGV with a full-length spike gene has tropism for both the respiratory and the enteric tracts, whereas strains with deletions (termed PRCV for porcine respiratory coronavirus) mainly replicate in and are transmitted via the respiratory tract (Kim et al., 2000; Sanchez et al., 1992). PRCV outcompeted TGEV in pig populations in spite of its virtual identical antigen composition (Openshaw, 2009). As respiratory viruses do not require direct contact for transmission, they are naturally more contagious irrespective of antigen variation and escape of population immunity.

            "text": "HCoV-NL63 was discovered by Dutch researchers in the supernatant of tertiary monkey kidney cells used to screen patients with respiratory disease (van der Hoek et al., 2004). An independent study, also from the Netherlands, found the same virus in blind cell culture isolate that had been stored for many years before final characterization (Fouchier et al., 2004). American researchers identified the same virus, then termed HCoV-NH (for New Haven), by RT-PCR (Esper et al., 2005). The first bat CoVs related to HCoV-NL63 were found in feces of European and African bats belonging to the family Vespertilionidae (Drexler et al., 2010; Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008; Pfefferle et al., 2009). While these viruses are related to HCoV-NL63, they are not conspecific. The same applies to another virus found in the American tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus, also a vespertilionid species), termed ARCoV.2, which is also not conspecific with HCoV-NL63 by definition (Donaldson et al., 2010). Nevertheless, this study provides functional data that bat cells can support HCoV-NL63 replication by conducting infection experiments in an immortalized lung cell line from the American tricolored bat (Donaldson et al., 2010; Huynh et al., 2012). The cell line was infected with HCoV-NL63 and virus replication was confirmed by the detection of subgenomic RNA and the production of nucleocapsid protein. Foci of infected cells appeared to increase when observed under a fluorescence microscope. Interestingly, the number of infectious particles as determined by plaque assay remained low, which was explained by a potential block in viral egress (Huynh et al., 2012). It was proposed that the functional and genetic findings for American tricolored bats and ARCoV.2 have implications on origins of HCoV-NL63 (Huynh et al., 2012).",

            "text": "More recently, other researchers presented three different sequences of CoVs in Triaenops affer (family Hipposideridae) from Kenya that are more closely related to HCoV-NL63 (Tao et al., 2017). These bats are not closely related to vespertilionids. The report by Tao et al. included one strain (BtKYNL63-9a, GenBank ACC no. KY073744) that exceeded the 90% amino acid sequence identity threshold applicable for species typing in three of the seven conserved gene domains (Tao et al., 2017). The genome organization of the NL63-related bat CoV was similar to that of HCoV-NL63 (ORF1ab-S-ORF3-E-M-N) with the exception that the bat CoV genomes coded for an additional open reading frame (ORF X) downstream of the N gene. Even if distance-based typing did not allow to formally classify the virus as conspecific with HCoV-NL63, there was evidence for recombination between ancestral lineages of BtKYNL63-9a and bat-associated HCoV-229E-related viruses (Tao et al., 2017). This is important as HCoV-NL63 and -229E form sister species. The recombination processes involved the spike gene via two breakpoints, one located near the gene's 5\u2032-end and the second around 200 nucleotides upstream of the 3\u2032-end (Tao et al., 2017). Similar recombination breakpoints were also reported for SARS- and SARS-like CoV and HCoV-OC43 (Hon et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2010, 2011). Because the existence of viable recombinants could indicate incomplete speciation, the existence of BtKYNL63-9a should be regarded as a hint toward the primordial host of HCoV-NL63. Its ancestors may well have existed in hipposiderid or rhinolophid bats.",

Epidemiological findings and physiological data suggested long-term endemicity and absence of disease in infected bats, which provides further support for a natural host relationship (Corman et al., 2015; Pfefferle et al., 2009). While humans can come in contact with hipposiderid bats in their natural habitats, the existence of the alpaca virus remained difficult to explain except by human-derived infection; hipposiderid bats and alpaca do not share habitats (Old World vs New World species) (Corman et al., 2015).",

Phylogenetic analyses of complete genomes placed the dromedary-associated viruses in sister relationship to HCoV-229E, while the Alpaca-CoV clustered with dromedary camel viruses. Alpaca is a species in the genus Vicugna of the family Camelidae. The monophyletic clade formed by human and camelid viruses has an immediate sister lineage within bat-associated viruses (Fig. 2A). Whereas the novel finding does not challenge the assumption of bats acting as natural hosts of HCoV-229E, the virus could have been acquired by humans or camels in either direction of transmission, and could also have been acquired by both from an unknown source including bats. However, more detailed analyses suggest HCoV-229E to have evolved toward the human genotype in camelids, thereby identifying the latter as a zoonotic source of human infection, and creating a scenario of emergence that is congruent with the present prepandemic pattern of MERS-CoV infection (Corman et al., 2015, 2016).",

HCoV-229E has retained the transcription regulatory sequence upstream of a remnant ORF 8 (Corman et al., 2016).

This is because camelid- and human strains, in contrast to bat-associated viruses, replicate primarily in the respiratory tract (Corman et al., 2016; Crossley et al., 2010). Loss of spike gene content could have occurred by recombination, as recombination breakpoints were identified in bat-associated viruses within the ORF1ab gene upstream of the spike gene, as well as at the border of the S1 and S2 domains. This is consistent with previous evidence of major recombination events which in part lead to changes in tropism or host association in other CoVs (Corman et al., 2014a; Eckerle et al., 2010; Sabir et al., 2016; Tao et al., 2017).",

Whether the zoonotic sources for this host transition were cattle, pigs, or other animals are not definitely resolved. However, the high diversity of related BetaCoV1 strains recently described in livestock species support their role as zoonotic sources in the emergence of HCoV-OC43 in humans. Why BetaCoV1 strains are found in many host species is not understood, but like for other CoVs recombination and deletion events likely played a role in these host-transition or adaptation processes. A deletion downstream of the spike gene of HCoV-OC43 was proposed to reflect adaptation to humans (Vijgen et al., 2005, 2006). Recombination within the species seems to promote the emergence of variants. For instance, Lu et al. recently described a novel canine respiratory coronavirus strain, which likely resulted from recombination between a Chinese canine respiratory coronavirus and BCoV (Lu et al., 2017).",

            "text": "There is a growing trend in the field of molecular epidemiology to conduct studies of host associations guided by taxonomy. Comprehensive studies suggest that the large lineages in the mammalian CoV phylogeny have primordial links to small mammals, focused but not limited to bats (Drexler et al., 2014; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2009a, Woo et al., 2009b). The enormous effort behind field studies can cause biases in the spectrum of potential host associations studied. The increased attention toward bats triggered by the discovery of natural host relationships for the SARS-CoV will continue to influence the current interpretations of CoV host associations (Guan et al., 2003). Already we sense that rodents, the largest group of mammals, seem to be underrepresented in studies of CoV hosts. The important role of rodents is highlighted by the recent findings of rodent CoVs that hint at primordial host relationships for the BetaCoV1 species. Data bias is further exemplified by the very few studies on CoVs in shrews and hedgehogs, belonging to the order Eulipotyphla. The 450 species in the order suggest a smaller genetic diversity as compared to the orders Rodentia and Chiroptera with 2269 and 1241 species, respectively. Nevertheless, surprisingly diverse alpha- and betacoronaviruses were detected in Eulipotyphla, including viruses clustering with important CoV clades such as MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2014c; Tsoleridis et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). Other CoVs in shrews and hedgehogs are genetically equidistant and represent relatively deep lineages in the phylogenetic tree. It seems possible that Eulipotyphla may provide missing links in the evolutionary history of some major CoV groups.",

For instance, while it has long been assumed that adaptive changes happened in the SARS-CoV spike protein during passage in civets, there are now reports suggesting direct infectivity, for humans, of some but not all virus variants existing in the natural host (Eckerle et al., 2010; Guan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005). Has the virus evolved in civets to become more compatible to humans? Or was it selected from a wider spectrum of variants that have different fitness upon host switching? Understanding (and eventually predicting) the process of host switching will have to be based on functional comparison of natural host-associated viruses with their epidemic counterparts.",

Understanding the past natural history of endemic HCoVs may help to recognize early signs of emergence from highly exposed hosts such as livestock species. We have ideas regarding the emergence of HCoV-OC43 that can potentially be refined (Vijgen et al., 2006). It seems peculiar that there is a complete absence of host-specific CoVs in great apes and other primates. This absence provides further support to the suspicion that contact with domestic animals may have been essential in human acquisition of most or all endemic CoV. For HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63, we therefore should study more of the virus diversity in livestock including closely related wildlife species to find footprints of their evolution and emergence. Finally, humans and domestic animals may have carried evolutionary intermediates that explain the emergence of major viral taxa, but that are extinct today.",
