In today\u2019s transient society, EIDs represent a serious public health concern due to their high potential to cause widespread epidemics and pandemics. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (>60%), characterized by \u201cspecies-jumping pathogens\u201d, the majority of which originate in wildlife and are able to replicate in humans [1]. The most pathogenic of the zoonotic diseases are those caused by RNA viruses, which have an unmatched ability to replicate in the new host species\u2019 cytoplasm [2], [3]. Bats have been identified or implicated as the natural host reservoir for an increasing number of new and often deadly zoonotic viruses [4], [5]. Examples of such bat-borne zoonotic diseases include Rift Valley fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Japanese Encephalitis virus, Ebola filovirus, Rabies lyssavirus, and the Paramyxoviridae including Hendra and Nipah virus [6].",

Since then there has been more than 48 sporadic Hendra virus outbreaks in Australia, killing four of the seven humans known to be infected with the virus and many horses [9]. In 1998, a deadly outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and abattoir workers in Malaysia was caused by the very closely related henipavirus species, Nipah virus (NiV) [4], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Outbreaks of NiV continue to occur throughout South-East Asia, India and Bangladesh. Both HeV and NiV are highly pathogenic in a wide variety of mammals, with mortality rates approaching 60%. Symptoms include; pulmonary hemorrhage and edema, encephalitis and meningitis.",

Our colleagues have recently identified the existence of a closely related, but non-pathogenic henipavirus; Cedar virus (CedPV), which is also transmitted by pteropid bat species [14]. Laboratory studies utilizing guinea pigs have demonstrated that CedPV can replicate in these animals, develop neutralizing antibodies, but remain clinically well [14]. The absence of therapeutic treatments for HeV and NiV, together with the susceptibility of humans to both viruses and their high virulence, has led to the classification of HeV and NiV as Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) pathogens [8], [9], [15]. A vaccine for HeV (Equivac\u00ae) has recently been developed for use in horses that is effective at protecting them from HeV infection, breaking the only known transmission mechanism from bats to humans [9], [16], [17], [18].",

The close relatedness of both HeV and NiV is further demonstrated by the observation that antibodies produced against one virus can neutralize the other in serum neutralization assays, albeit with reduced efficiency [16]. The genomic RNA from HeV and NiV along with other nsNSRV (e.g. Measles virus) encodes the six major viral structural proteins; nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), attachment glycoprotein (G), and the large protein (L) (RNA polymerase) [8], [11], [19], [20], the most abundant protein being the N protein [21], [22], [23]. The size of both the HeV genome (18.234 kilobases) and NiV genome (18.246 kilobases) are considerably larger than other paramyxoviruses (average size 15.6 kilobases), and fit the \u201crule of six\u201d, which stipulates that the paramyxovirus RNA polymerase will only replicate efficiently if the viral genome is a multiple of six nucleotides (6n + 0 nucleotides) [20], [24], [25]. Interestingly, the length of these genomes is somewhat closer to the length of the genomes of family Filoviridae viruses (18.9\u201319.1 kilobases), which includes Ebola and Marburg viruses [26], [27]. The N protein of NSRV forms a complex with viral RNA (N-RNA), which then associates with P and L to form a stable ribo-nucleocapsid protein complex (RNP) required for the transcription and replication of viral RNA [28], [29].",

Both recombinant HeV NFL and HeV NCORE were purified using a combination of IMAC and SEC under non-denaturing conditions in the presence of 500 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol to minimize protein aggregation and precipitation. Both recombinant HeV NFL and HeV NCORE eluted from the Nickel IMAC column with 300 mM imidazole, were concentrated and further fractionated by SEC. A 1 mg/mL solution of Blue Dextran (Mw 2,000 kDa, High Molecular Weight Gel Filtration Calibration Kit, 28-4038-42, GE Healthcare) in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 containing 1 M NaCl was used to determine the void volume of the SEC columns (data not shown). Both HeV N proteins migrated in the calculated void volume of the column (Superdex 200 26/600 gel filtration column V\no \u2013 120.5 mL and Superdex 200 16/600 gel filtration column \u2013 V\no 43.6 mL), with an apparent molecular weight of >670 kDa (Fig. 3\nA and B respectively). This observation was consistent with both proteins forming higher order soluble oligomers. Western blotting using the anti-polyHistidine Peroxidase Conjugate antibody confirmed peak fractions eluting near the void volume were the Hisx6-tagged HeV N proteins (Fig. 4\nB and D). Western blot analysis of HeV NFL indicated that the major dominant band was the full-length protein (\u223c65 kDa), this was susceptible to proteolysis in E. coli (Fig. 4B). Four C-terminally truncated forms of HeV N were identified by the anti-His-HRP antibody which identified the N-terminal Hisx6 tag on the protein. It is interesting to note that one of the smaller protease resistant fragments of HeV NFL migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 40 kDa (Fig. 4B), which was very similar to the expected size of our expressed HeV NCORE (Fig. 4D).",

Similar observations have previously been made for NiV N expressed in E. coli and negative stain EM analysis indicated the presence of nucleocapsid-like herringbone particles of different lengths, morphologically resembling the structure of RNPs isolated from virus particles [23], [37]. EM analysis of HeV and NiV N expressed in S. cerevisiae also demonstrated that these proteins are able to form nucleocapsid-like herringbone structures and rings [34]. Detailed biophysical characterization studies have been undertaken on the N protein of another paramyxovirus, Measles virus (MeV) [38], [39], [40]. Full-length MeV N protein (MeV NFL) was expressed and purified from E. coli, C-terminally truncated MeV N (MeV NCORE) was prepared by limited proteolysis [38]. Negative-stain EM studies on these proteins revealed that MeV NCORE polymerizes into very long and extremely rigid helices [29], [38], similar to the structures we observed for our HeV NCORE. Interestingly, their studies demonstrated that MeV NFL protein assembled into short and much less rigid helices or mostly only ring structures as we also observed with the HeV NFL images. They postulated that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail was responsible for the restricted of polymerization N monomers in full length N proteins [38].",

            "text": "Analysis of the amino acid sequences of both the HeV and NiV N reveal that they do not contain any cysteine residues and subsequently disulfide bonds cannot be responsible for maintaining the tertiary structure of the protein complex. This suggests that the oligomerization of the paramyxovirus N protein is maintained by intra- or intermolecular, non-covalent bonds or by the viral or host expression system nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) or both [23], [41], [42]. Amino acid alignments identified four highly conserved hydrophobic regions in Paramyxoviridae N proteins [43]. The construction of a series of amino acid deletion mutants has enabled the identification of four small continuous stretches of amino acids responsible for the self-assembly of the N protein [37]. The removal of any of these domains prevented oligomerization of N monomers; however, the replacement of these deleted regions with the same conserved amino acid region from Newcastle Disease Virus N protein restored oligomerization [37]. These studies further demonstrated that the deletion of more than 129 amino acids from the C-terminus of the NiV N protein inhibited the formation of herringbone-like capsid molecules (NiV N(1\u2013402) and NiV N(1\u2013401)), whereas the deletion of less than 128 amino acids did not prevent oligomerization or capsid formation (NiV N(1\u2013404)) [37]. Contrary to those observations, our results indicated that HeV NCORE(1-402) is able to still able to form oligomers even with the deletion 130 amino acids, indicating the construct contains all the necessary amino acid residues for self-assembly. Detailed biophysical validation techniques such as analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle light scattering are needed to confirm whether HeV NFL and HeV NCORE exist as a stable multimer in solution.",

Further studies on MeV N protein have indicated that the hypervariable C-terminal tail appears to be at the surface of the N assembly with a structure that is not well-visualized by electron microscopy [38], [39]. This observation is also a potential indicator that the accessibility of the C-terminal tail region increases the susceptibility of the domain to proteolysis and likelihood of intracellular proteolysis when over-expressed in E. coli or other heterologous expression systems. These observations have been made for preparations of HeV NFL protein and NiV NFL expressed in E. coli and S. cerevisiae\n[34], [35], [44], [45]. Utilizing bioinformatics proteolysis prediction tools, it has been demonstrated that the proteolytic degradation of E. coli expressed NiV N could be reduced by the choice and concentration of specific serine protease inhibitors [35]. Our bacterial expression studies reveal a high level of proteolysis in the E. coli preparations of HeV NFL, despite the addition of an extensive cocktail of general and serine specific protease inhibitors to the cellular lysis buffer.",

The current assays utilize the vaccine antigen (HeV sG) and as such are unable to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). The gold standard diagnostic assay is the virus neutralization test which is also ineffective in determining if an animal has been infected or vaccinated. The Luminex assay results from this study indicate that either format of recombinant HeV N expressed and purified could be used equally well to detect antibodies in HeV-infected animals, as well as those infected with the closely related NiV, but are able to differentiate from other known henipaviruses (Cedar Virus (CedPV)), providing an important component of a DIVA assay. The low-level immunoreactivity seen with the HeV NCORE to normal horse, vaccinated horse, normal human and normal pig and to the vaccinated horse sera for the HeV NFL is most likely due to cross-reactivity to related paramyxoviruses, since the N protein of paramyxoviruses is highly conserved. There has only been limited optimization of the antigen coupling process in this assay and further adjustment may also increase the differentiation of positive and negative HeV sera lowering the threshold for negative sera. These proteins would need to be tested against large numbers of normal sera and against control sera for other paramyxoviruses to determine the levels of cross reactivity prior to their validation in DIVA assays. Despite this low-level reactivity, the promising results from the Luminex assay indicate that both forms of recombinant HeV N would be valuable antigens to differentiate animals which had been naturally infected with HeV from those vaccinated with the HeV soluble Glycoprotein (sG) vaccine. Additionally, they will also be valuable reagents for serological surveillance of henipaviruses in wildlife and domestic livestock when used along with the sG in multiplex assays. When used in combination they will provide an opportunity for the identification of antibodies to related viruses that would otherwise be missed by the specificity of the sG proteins.",

TEM analysis revealed both forms of HeV N assembled into helical ring-like structures that very closely resembled paramyxovirus-like particles Using a Luminex bead-based immunoassay, we were able to demonstrate both recombinant HeV NFL and HeV NCORE were highly immuno-reactive towards sera from animals and humans infected with either HeV or its\u2019 very close relative, NiV, but not with sera from animals infected with a non-pathogenic Henipavirus, CedPV. Furthermore, by incorporating this antigen into the current assays we are now able to distinguish between animals infected with HeV (or NiV) and those vaccinated against this virus. The ability to identify infected from vaccinated animals will be a very useful tool for undertaking epidemiological studies and understanding infection and transmission dynamics of HeV between its\u2019 natural host reservoir pteropid bats and spillover targets domestic livestock and humans.
