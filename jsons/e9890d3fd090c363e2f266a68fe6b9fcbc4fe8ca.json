Factors contributing to this are many, but the principal drivers have been complacency and de-emphasis of infectious diseases in pubic health policy, increased population growth, uncontrolled urbanization without concomitant attention to water and waste management, increased globalization and the ease with which modern air transport can quickly spread pathogens and their vectors. The re-emergence of parasitic, bacterial and viral vector-borne pathogens is described. This re-emergence increases the current and future need for preventative measures to contain disease outbreaks and for international cooperation and collaboration to constantly monitor the outbreak of these debilitating and deadly diseases.",

Subsequently, other vector-borne diseases were identified as major causes of disease in both humans and domestic animals. As the natural history of these diseases became better understood, prevention and control measures, primarily directed at the arthropod vectors, were highly successful in controlling disease transmission. Effective prevention and control accelerated in the post-World War II years with the advent of new insecticides, drugs, and vaccines. By the 1960s, the majority of important vector-borne diseases had been effectively controlled in most parts of the world, and those that were not yet controlled were targeted for more intensive programs using new vaccines, drugs, and insecticides.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, \"success led to failure\"; some of the successful programs, such as the Aedes aegypti eradication program that effectively controlled epidemic YF and DF throughout the American tropics for over 40 years, and the global malaria eradication program that effectively controlled malaria in Asian and American countries, were disbanded in the 1970s because the diseases were no longer major public health problems (Gubler 1989 (Gubler , 2004 Gubler and Wilson 2005; IOM 1992) . Additionally, residual insecticides were replaced with less effective chemicals used as space sprays to control adult mosquitoes. The 1970s ushered in a 25-year period characterized by decreasing resources for infectious diseases, decay of the public health infrastructure to control vector-borne diseases, and a general perception that vector-borne diseases were no longer important public health problems. Coincident with this period of complacency, however, was the development of global trends that have contributed to the reemergence of epidemic infectious diseases in general, and vector-borne diseases in particular, in the past 25 years. In addition to the emergence of newly recognized diseases, there was increased incidence and geographic expansion of well-known diseases that were once effectively controlled (Gubler 1989 (Gubler , 1998 IOM 1992 IOM , 2003 Mahy and Murphy 2005) . This paper will briefly review the changing epidemiology of several of the most important vector-borne diseases and discuss the lessons learned from this global reemergence.",

Both have small rodents as their natural vertebrate reservoir host, with hard ticks as their principal vectors. Both diseases are found primarily in temperate regions of the world, where emergence has been associated with environmental change. Figure 1 shows the dramatic increase in reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began surveillance in 1982. The increased transmission in the United States is directly related to reforestation of the northeastern United States, allowing the mouse and deer populations to increase unchecked, which in turn has allowed the tick population to increase. A final factor has been the trend in recent decades to build houses in woodlots where humans share the ecology with deer, mice, and ticks; thus most transmission to humans in the northeastern United States where the majority of cases of Lyme disease occur, is residential (Steere et al. 2004) .",

            "text": "Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, is the most important reemergent bacterial vector-borne disease. The current global increase in case reports of plague is primarily due to outbreaks in Africa. However, it is the potential of plague to cause explosive epidemics of pneumonic disease, transmitted person-to-person and with high mortality that makes it important as a reemergent infectious disease and as a potential bioterrorist threat. This was illustrated in 1994 when an outbreak of plague occurred in Surat, Gujarat, India (WHO 1994) . Although this was a small outbreak (most likely less than 50 cases) that should have been a relatively unimportant local public health event, it became a global public health emergency. The reasons for this are complicated and beyond the scope of this article, but it is a Gubler (1998) and CDC (2006) , courtesy, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, CDC, Fort Collins, CO classic case of \"success breeding failure.\" Briefly, because the Indian Health Service had successfully controlled epidemic plague in India for over 30 years (the last confirmed human plague case prior to 1994 was in 1966), laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic capacity to diagnose and control plague had deteriorated. Thus, when the Surat outbreak occurred, the clinical and laboratory diagnosis was confused, creating lack of confidence in public health agencies and ultimately panic when it was finally announced that the disease was pneumonic plague. Within a few weeks in early October 1994, an estimated 500,000 people fled Surat, a city of about 2 million people at that time. Many of these people traveled to other urban areas in India, and within days, newspapers were reporting plague cases in other cities. The World Health Organization implemented Article 11 of the International Health Regulations (WHO 1983) for the first time in 33 years because it was thought that people with pneumonic plague might board airplanes in India and transport the disease to other urban centers around the world (Fig. 2) . Many countries stopped air travel and trade with India and most implemented enhanced surveillance for imported plague cases via airplane travel. This was the first global emerging infectious disease epidemic that impacted the global economy since infectious diseases were controlled in the 1950s. It is estimated that this small outbreak cost India US$3 billion (John 1999) and the global economy US$5-$6 billion. Fortunately, there were no cases of plague exported from India (Fritz et al. 1996) , but this epidemic was the \"wake-up call\" that modern transportation and globalization were major drivers of pandemic infectious diseases. It was this epidemic that helped stimulate in the first funding of CDC's Emerging Infectious Disease Program. ",

The virus was enzootic throughout Africa, West and Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean, with occasional extension into Europe (Hayes 1988) . A subtype of WNV (Kunjin) is also found in Australia (Hall et al. 2002) . A characteristic of WNV epidemiology during this 62-year history was that it caused epidemics only occasionally, and the illness in humans, horses, and birds was generally either asymptomatic or mild; neurologic disease and death were rare (Marfin and Gubler 2001; Murgue et al. 2001 Murgue et al. , 2002 .",

Because of the age group involved and the clinical presentation, these cases were initially thought to be St. Louis encephalitis, but subsequent serologic and virologic investigation showed them to be caused by WNV (Lanciotti et al. 1999 ). The epidemic investigation, which focused only on neurologic disease, identified 62 cases with 7 (11%) deaths, all of them in New York City . Epidemiologic studies, however, showed widespread transmission throughout New York City, with thousands of infections (Montashari et al. 2001; Nash et al. 2001) . The virus caused a high fatality rate in birds, especially those in the family Corvidae (Komar 2003) . Genetic sequence of the infecting virus suggested it was imported from the Middle East, most likely from Israel (Lanciotti et al. 1999) . Although it will never be known for sure, epidemiologic and virologic evidence suggests the virus was introduced in the spring or early summer of 1999, most likely via infected humans arriving from Israel, which was experiencing an epidemic of WNV in Tel Aviv at the time (Giladi et al. 2001; Marfin and Gubler 2001) .",

This conclusion is supported by data on the movement of WNV in migratory birds in the Old World (Malkinson et al. 2002) . Moreover, the westward movement of WNV across the United States and Canada can best be explained by introduction via migratory birds that fly south to Central and South America in the fall and north from those areas in the spring. Thus, the yearly movement westward in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 shows very good correlation with the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific flyways of migratory birds (Figs. 3 and 5). After introduction to an area, local dispersion of WNV likely occurred via movement of resident birds, which often fly significant distances. Interestingly, the major epidemic in each region of the country occurred the following year after introduction, with the exception of the 1999 New York outbreak.",

This virus most likely had better fitness and caused higher viremias in susceptible hosts, allowing it to take advantage of modern transportation and globalization to spread, first in the Mediterranean region and Europe, and then to the western hemisphere. This speculation is supported by sequence data documenting that the viruses isolated from these recent epidemics/epizootics are closely related genetically, most likely having a common origin; all belonged to the same clade (Lanciotti et al. 1999 (Fig. 7) . Moreover, experimental infection of birds has documented that viruses in this clade, represented by the New York 1999 isolate, have greater virulence than virus strains isolated earlier (Brault et al. 2004; Langevin et al. 2005) .",

They have become completely adapted to humans and current evidence suggests that the sylvatic cycle is not a major factor in the current emergence of epidemic disease (Gubler 1997; Rico-Hesse 1990) .",

Major epidemics of DF occurred as port cities were urbanized and became infested with Ae. aegypti. Because the viruses depended on the shipping industry for spread, however, epidemics in different geographic regions were sporadic, occurring at 10-40-year intervals. The disease pattern changed with the ecological disruption in Southeast Asia during and after World War II. The economic development, population growth and uncontrolled urbanization in the post-war years created ideal conditions for increased transmission and spread of urban mosquito-borne diseases, initiating a global pandemic of dengue. With increased epidemic transmission, and the movement of people within and between countries, hyperendemicity (the co-circulation of multiple DENV serotypes) developed in Southeast Asian cities, and epidemic DHF, a newly described disease, emerged (Gubler 1997; Halstead 1980; WHO 1997) .",

It is the type species of the family (Flaviviridae: genus Flavivirus) (Gubler et al. 2007b) . Its natural home is the rainforests of sub-Saharan Africa where it is maintained in a cycle involving lower primates and canopy-dwelling mosquitoes (Monath 1988) . It was transported to the western hemisphere with the slave trade in the 1600s and became adapted to an urban cycle involving humans and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, similar to dengue. It also established a sylvatic monkey cycle in the rain forests of the Amazon basin similar to the one in Africa. The first recorded epidemic of YF occurred in 1648 and was followed by numerous epidemics in port cities of the New World, as far north as Boston (Monath 1988) . Urban epidemic transmission was effectively controlled in the Americas in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s by the Aedes aegypti eradication program (see earlier discussion) (Gubler 1989; Schliessman and Calheiros 1974) (Fig. 8) . The last known urban epidemic occurred in Brazil in 1942 (Monath 1988) . In Francophone countries of West Africa, YF was controlled by mass vaccination programs. The result was the disappearance of major urban epidemics of YF in both Africa and the Americas. In the mid-1980s, however, the urban disease reemerged in West Africa, with major epidemics in Nigeria and increased transmission in other countries (Gubler 2004; Monath 1988; Nasidi et al. 1989; Robertson et al. 1996) . Kenya experienced its first epidemic in history in 1993 (Sanders et al. 1998 ). In the Americas, the reinfestion of most Central and South American countries by Aedes aegypti has put the urban centers of the American tropics at the highest risk for epidemic urban YF in more than 60 years (Gubler 2008b) . Thus, the disease continues to be an important public health problem in both Africa and the Americas.",

YFV was most likely introduced sporadically to the Pacific and Asia in the past (Usinger 1944) , but secondary transmission has never been documented. There are several possible explanations why there have not been YF epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region (Monath 1989) . First, logistics: during the time when major YF epidemics were occurring in the Americas, the virus and the mosquitoes depended on ocean vessels to be transported to new geographical locations. The probabilities of the virus being introduced to Asia were low because the Panama Canal had not been built, and there was not as much commerce between Caribbean, Central and South American counties and Asia, as there was with the United States and Europe. Moreover, YF epidemics were not common in East Africa, thus decreasing the probability of introduction to India. Second, the high heterotypic flavivirus antibody (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, JEV, and many other flaviviruses of lesser importance) rates in Asian populations, while not protecting against YF infection, could possibly modulate the infection and down-regulate viremia and clinical expression, as has been shown in monkeys (Theiler and Anderson 1975) , thus decreasing the likelihood of secondary transmission by mosquitoes. Third, there has been some suggestion that Asian strains of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are less susceptible to YFV than American strains (Gubler et al. 1982 ). Finally, it is possible that evolutionary exclusion may prevent YFV from becoming established in areas where closely related flaviviruses are endemic.",

As noted for Asia, the high seroprevalance rates for the DENVs and other flaviviruses in most Central and South American countries could down-regulate viremia and illness, thus decreasing the risk of secondary transmission and clinical diagnosis. Additionally, the enzootic YFV may require adaptation to Aedes aegypti and humans, before becoming highly transmissible in the urban environment. If it does become adapted, however, it is important to remember that the logistic and demographic factors that influence arbovirus spread at the beginning of the 21st century are very different from past centuries. First, tens of millions of people travel by jet airplane between the cities of tropical America and the Asia-Pacific region every year; this provides the ideal mechanism for people incubating YFV to transport it to new geographic locations. There has been an increase in ecotourism in recent years, and since 1996, at least six tourists have died in the United States and Europe as a result of infection with YFV acquired during travel to YF endemic countries without vaccination (CDC 2000; Gubler 2004; Gubler and Wilson 2005) . If urban epidemic transmission of YF begins in the Americas, there could be thousands of YFV infected people traveling to Asia-Pacific countries where Aedes aegypti exposure is high, thus dramatically increasing the probability that epidemic YF transmission will occur in Asia.",

Complacency and deemphasis of infectious diseases as public health problems in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in a redirection of resources and ultimately to a decay of the public health infrastructure required to control these diseases. Coincident with this trend, unprecedented population growth, primarily in the cities of the developing world, facilitated transmission and geographic spread. This uncontrolled urbanization and crowding resulted in a deterioration in housing accompanied by a lack of basic services (e.g., water, sewer, and waste management). Population growth has been a major driver of environmental change in rural areas as well (e.g., deforestation, agriculture land use, and animal husbandry practice changes). All of these changes contributed to increased incidence of vector-borne infectious diseases.",

In addition, globalization has insured an equally dramatic increase in the movement of animals and commodities between population centers. The jet airplane provides the ideal mechanism by which pathogens of all kinds move around the world in infected humans, vertebrate host animals, and vectors. A classic example of how urbanization combined with globalization has influenced the geographic expansion of disease is illustrated by the DENVs (Fig. 11) . In 1970, only Southeast Asian countries were hyperendemic with Mackenzie et al. (2004) multiple virus serotypes co-circulating, as a result of World War II. The rest of the tropical world was hypoendemic with only a single DENV serotype circulating, or nonendemic (Fig. 11a) . In 2007, the whole of the tropical world is hyperendemic as a direct result of urbanization, lack of mosquito control, and increased movement of viruses in people via modern transportation (Fig. 11b) . The result has been increased frequency of larger epidemics, and the emergence of the severe and fatal form of disease, DHF, in most tropical areas of the world. Globalizaton and modern transportation were also responsible for the recent spread of WNV to and throughout the western hemisphere (Fig. 6) . Increased transmission is a major driver of genetic change in all of these viruses, which can result in virus strains with greater virulence or epidemic potential being spread around the globe. The concern is that YF or RVF will be the next vector-borne diseases to spread because of globalization and modern transportation.",
