Clinical recognition is limited because the symptoms of RSV illness are similar to those of other respiratory viruses, and highly sensitive diagnostic tests for RSV are not routinely performed. Furthermore RSV diagnostic tests, especially rapid-antigen tests, are less sensitive in adults compared to children because of much lower levels of virus that are shed [5]. A surveillance study identified 211 RSV infections in healthy adults from 1975 through 1995; 84% were symptomatic, and one quarter of the symptomatic infections involved the lower respiratory tract [6]. A prospective cohort study involving 608 healthy older adults over 4 winter seasons (2000\u20132003) reported an annual RSV incidence of 3% to 7% in the cohort; RSV generated fewer office visits than influenza [7]. Other studies [8]\u2013[10] have assessed the presence of RSV in samples collected from patients with acute respiratory illness in emergency or inpatient settings. In contrast, data characterizing the population incidence and burden of RSV illness among older adults are scarce.",

Potential participants with illness duration >7 days (>10 days in 2006\u201307) were excluded to minimize false negative test results. Research coordinators used an electronic appointment system to screen chief complaints and identify potential participants in primary care departments at the Marshfield Clinic main campus and a satellite clinic. Eligible patients were also recruited from the Emergency Department and at the time of admission to the only acute care hospital serving the study population (St. Joseph's Hospital).

Nucleic acid was extracted from the swabs using the Roche MagnaPure 2.0 system and was then amplified using RT-PCR with target-specific primers. Target-specific signals were determined by voltammetry, a process which generates electrical signals from ferrocene-labeled signal probes. We validated the GenMark multiplex assay RSV A and B against singleplex assays developed by CDC. The sensitivity and specificity was 98% and 99% for RSV (unpublished data), which was consistent with GenMark multiplex RT-PCR compared to singleplex in pediatric samples [16]. Multiplex RT-PCR results have been reported separately in adults for other viruses [17], and only RSV results were used for the current analysis.",

For each person in the cohort, respiratory illness visits were classified as either absent (0 visits) or present (\u22651 visit) based on the presence or absence of a relevant MAARI code during the study enrollment period. The number of RSV episodes among nonenrolled cohort members was estimated by multiplying the proportion RSV positive (among enrolled individuals) by the number of nonenrolled individuals with a MAARI episode (defined by ICD-9 codes). Although rare, a few enrolled patients did not receive a diagnosis code for acute respiratory illness because eligibility was based on presenting symptoms rather than diagnosis codes.

The outcome in the Poisson models was the dichotomous virus test result (coded 1 = positive, 0 = negative). We calculated the numerator as the sum of enrolled participants with RT-PCR confirmed RSV and the estimated number of non-enrolled cohort members with RSV based on the assumptions listed above. Analytic weights were created by extrapolating RSV positivity proportions for enrolled patients with MAARI episodes to other nonenrolled cohort members with MAARI episodes within strata defined by age group (50\u201359, 60\u201369, and \u226570 years), gender and season. Enrolled patients with no MAARI episodes were assigned analytic weights of 1.0. The analytic weights were then multiplied by the appropriate state level adjustment factors as described above. The offset terms were stratified by season, age group and gender. Within each stratum, the offset was the natural logarithm of the following quantity: number of cohort members divided by the sum of analytic weights.

The percent of community cohort members who had a MAARI episode during the enrollment period (including those not enrolled) ranged from 6% to 12% (Table 2). There were 1,326 eligible enrollments across all seasons for adults \u226550 years old, and 164 (12%) were positive for RSV. Clinical characteristics of the RSV infections have been previously reported [17]; 93% presented with cough, 79% with nasal congestion, 65% with fever, and 51% with wheezing. Among the 164 RSV positive cases, 154 (94%) received at least one MAARI diagnosis code; the remaining 10 patients had a chief complaint of acute respiratory illness but did not receive a MAARI diagnosis code. The mean and median age of RSV infected patients was 64.2 and 61.5 years, and 101 (62%) were female (Table 1). The median interval from symptom onset to enrollment was 4 days for both for those testing positive and those testing negative for RSV. Seven (4%) of 164 RSV cases had preexisting CHF and 7 (4%) had COPD; 14 (9%) had RT-PCR evidence of infection with another virus in addition to RSV. Ten (6%) of 164 patients with RSV were hospitalized within 14 days after illness onset.",

The seasonal incidence of RSV infection was reported to be 300 to 700 per 10,000 elderly adults. In the Rochester study, 17% of RSV infections resulted in a health care encounter. If we apply this proportion to the total number of RSV cases in the healthy elderly Rochester cohort, we estimate that the seasonal incidence of medically attended RSV was approximately 50 to 120 episodes per 10,000. The Rochester study also followed a cohort of high risk adults with chronic heart or lung disease, and the estimated seasonal incidence of medically attended RSV was higher (approximately 180 to 440 per 10,000) in that group.",

The studies also differed in terms of age distribution and diagnostic testing methods. The Rochester cohort was older with a mean age of 75 years compared to 64 years in the Marshfield cohort.

The results of this study identify RSV as a common cause of acute respiratory illness among community-dwelling older adults in the outpatient setting. The time lag we observed between the statewide RSV peak and the peak incidence in our population of older adults is consistent with a prior study in the United Kingdom that compared the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in adults with the number of RSV positives based on clinical testing over 10 seasons [23]. In both Marshfield and the United Kingdom, there was a time lag of a few weeks between the peak RSV occurrence based on clinical testing (largely in children) and the peak incidence in older adults during most seasons. These findings suggest that children may be an important source of RSV transmission to older adults, and interventions to prevent RSV in children may also benefit the older adult population.
