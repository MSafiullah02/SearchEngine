            "text": "The objective was to develop an experimental model of septic arthritis in calves and to evaluate the effect of treatment on cytologic and bacteriologic variables of synovial fluid. The right tarsus of 7 healthy Holstein bull calves were inoculated with 10 8 colonyforming units of viable Escherichia coli of a pap-positive strain (day 1). On day 2, joint lavage was performed and antibiotic treatment was instituted. Cytologic examinations, bacterial cultures, and pap factor determinations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed on synovial fluid samples that were collected daily until day 4, then every 4 days until day 24. Results of physical examination, the severity of lameness, and swelling were recorded. Clinical signs of septic arthritis appeared on day 2 and persisted until day 9 for all calves. Bacterial cultures from all calves were positive for E coli on day 2, and remained positive until day 3 for 1 calf and until day 4 for 5 calves. In addition, PCR results were positive for all calves, with 6 positive through day 3 and 1 positive through day 4, after which a positive result was again obtained on day 24. Synovial fluid neutrophil counts and white blood cell counts were significantly increased on days 2-4; however, synovial total protein concentrations were increased (P \u03fd .05) throughout the experiment in comparison to day 1. Results of all bacterial cultures were negative on day 8, although clinicopathologic signs of inflammation persisted until day 20. This model successfully induced acute septic arthritis in calves. Rapid recovery occurred within 1 week when an appropriate treatment was instituted early in the course of the disease.",

            "text": "S eptic arthritis may occur by direct trauma or contamination of the joint, extension from periarticular infection, or hematogenously. 1 An acute inflammatory response occurs after bacterial contamination of the joint. 2 This reaction initiates a rapid influx of inflammatory cells, mostly neutrophils, as well as activation of synoviocytes and chondrocytes, release of many inflammatory mediators, and finally decreased proteoglycan synthesis. 2 This cascade of events ultimately leads to a reduction in joint lubrication and an increase in cartilage destruction, thus contributing to the process of joint disease. 2 Chronic septic arthritis may develop and may be attributed to persistent bacterial infection, presence of bacterial wall materials, or an immunemediated process. 3 Diagnosis of septic arthritis is based on the combination of clinical signs, radiographic examination, bacterial culture, and cytologic analysis of synovial fluid. 4 A bacterium is isolated in only 60% of cases of septic arthritis in bovine medicine. a Consequently, synovial fluid cytologic analysis is very useful for the differentiation between infectious and noninfectious arthritis. 4 Treatment of septic arthritis in cattle is based on the early administration of antibiotics for a duration of 2-3 weeks combined with joint lavage. 5, 6 Antiinflammatory drugs also are recommended to reduce pain and swelling. 7 Frequency of persistence of bacteria in the joint after infection and treatment is unknown in cattle. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in up to 70% of joints after 20 days of systemic antibiotic treatment in induced equine arthritis. 8 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of human synovial samples revealed that bacterial DNA cannot be detected after 26 days of treatment, 9 although results of Gram stain and cultures usually become negative 3 days after the initiation of therapy. In a clinical report of a human patient with septic arthritis caused by S aureus, bacterial DNA could be detected up to 10 weeks after the initiation of an adequate antibiotic treatment. 10 PCR techniques that apply pathogen-specific primers 10 or broad-range 16S ribosomal RNA and subsequent DNA sequencing 9 are used for the diagnosis of septic arthritis in human medicine. The advantages of these techniques are their rapidity, their capacity to detect fastidious organisms, and their capacity to detect bacteria during antibiotic treatment. 11 The objectives of this study of induced septic arthritis in calves were to create a reproducible model of induced septic arthritis, to describe synovial fluid components before and after treatment, and to estimate the average survival time of bacteria after the initiation of an effective antibiotic treatment by using standard bacterial culture and PCR techniques.",

Results of synovial fluid bacterial culture are reported to become negative 3 days after the beginning of antibiotic treatment in humans. 9 In cases of human patients with treated septic arthritis, synovial bacterial culture results could be negative despite presence of viable bacteria. 23 These negative results could be explained by low bacterial count, leukocyte activity, or direct effect of antibiotics. 23 As previously recommended, 23 blood culture bottles were used in the current study to improve ability to isolate E coli. Blood culture bottles enhance bacterial culture by using a rich medium, additives to eliminate endogenous and exogenous antimicrobial factors, and a large inoculum to ensure against a low microbial density. 23 At the end of the experiment, results of all bacterial cultures of synovial fluid were negative despite termination of treatment 3 days earlier. Consequently, joints were considered sterile after day 21, and the treatment instituted in this study appears effective in eliminating joint infections. In models of equine septic arthritis induced by S aureus, results of most synovial fluid cultures remained positive for 21 days after the beginning of the experiments and 1 day after stopping an effective antibiotic treatment. 8, 20 These results can be explained by virulence and tropism differences between S aureus and E coli. S aureus has a higher tropism for synovium and can survive intracellularly. 24 The use of PCR may be helpful in monitoring the presence of bacterial DNA in the synovial fluid during antibiotic treatment in addition to measuring the efficacy of this treatment. PCR has already been used in human medicine for the detection of bacterial DNA in septic synovial fluid samples by using pathogen-specific primers 10 or broadrange 16S ribosomal RNA. 9 In our study, pathogen-specific primers were used to estimate the average isolation time of bacterial DNA. The concordance between the PCR results and the bacteriologic results on days 1 and 2 indicated the reliability of the PCR.",

This may be exacerbated when only a very small specimen volume (ie, \u03fd20 L) is available. 11 Centrifugation was used in previous reports to concentrate bacterial DNA in the sample. 10, 25, 26 Primary reports in this study did not demonstrate any differences between centrifuged and noncentrifuged samples. These samples originated from only 1 site in the joints, and consequently may not have cellular and bacterial components representative of the entire joint, thus explaining certain negative results.",

Negative PCR results from synovial fluid or synovial tissues that became positive several days later have already been reported. 9,10 A decrease in concentration of inhibitory substances consecutive with decreased inflammation could explain why 1 synovial fluid PCR became positive again on day 24. Antibiotic treatment was stopped between day 20 and day 24. It is very unlikely that antibiotic treatment interfered with PCR procedures. On day 4, 2 calves had positive PCR results, whereas they had received 2 days of antibiotic treatment. Ceftiofur is not known to inhibit polymerases. Ceftiofur behaves like betalactam antibiotic by binding to and inactivating the penicillin-binding proteins. 28 The significance of the presence of DNA of E coli for 1 calf on day 24 is uncertain. Because results of the bacterial culture were negative, this result may indicate that nonviable bacteria were present in the synovial fluid. Because pathogen-specific primers were used in this study, and all PCRs were performed twice, these positive PCR results could not be interpreted as false positive. In humans, bacterial DNA has been found to be able to persist for a few weeks 9 and up to 10 weeks 10 after the initiation of antibiotic therapy. The presence of bacterial DNA can explain the persistence of cytologic evidence of inflammation.",

It is reported that for a leukocyte count of 7,000 leukocytes/L, the total inherent error is 21%. 31 Error in manual counting procedures can be minimized by adequate procedures and experience of the manipulator. 31 Another possible explanation is that the synovial fluid is not homogeneous and only a portion was evaluated at each sampling. Consequently, during the course of a septic arthritis treatment, an increase in synovial cytologic values should not be misinterpreted as a nonresponse to treatment or a relapse.",

Long-term systemic administration of antibiotics and joint lavage was effective in treating septic arthritis caused by E coli in calves in this study. Duration of antibiotic administration in acute septic arthritis remains empirical. Certain authors considered that it must be at least 3 weeks in cattle. 7 The duration of antibiotic treatment in humans 33 and horses 8 is usually 4 weeks. Results of this study were in favor of a short-term antibiotic therapy based on improvement in clinical signs and negative results of bacterial culture soon after the induction of septic arthritis. Nevertheless, extrapolation to naturally acquired septic arthritis must be made cautiously. The treatment instituted in this study was based on pharmacologic properties of ceftiofur 19 and susceptibilities of E coli. Moreover, treatment was instituted early in the course of the disease. Joint lavage and debridement are important steps in the treatment of septic arthritis in order to remove the potential deleterious enzymes and their cellular sources. 2 Despite no effect on cellular count, results of this study are in favor of the use of joint lavages because these significantly reduce protein concentrations. The persistence of cytologic signs of inflammation and joint distension were suggestive of an important persistent inflam-matory process secondary to the infection. Therefore, antiinflammatory drugs should always be considered in the treatment of septic arthritis as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics. Further studies are necessary to refine their use in clinical cases.",
