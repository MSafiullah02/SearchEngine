Traditional or known risk factors for severe disease are well described, but there are limited data on risks for prolonged hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Our aims were to determine factors (clinical and microbiological) associated with (i) prolonged length of stay (LOS); (ii) persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks; (iii) bronchiectasis up to $24 months post-hospitalisation; and (iv) risk of respiratory readmissions within 6 months. Methods: Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis were enrolled at Royal Darwin Hospital between 2008 and 2013. Standardized forms were used to record clinical data. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected at enrolment to identify respiratory viruses and bacteria. Results: The median age of 232 infants was 5 months (interquartile range 3-9); 65% male. On multivariate regression, our 12 point severity score (including accessory muscle use) was the only factor associated with prolonged LOS but the effect was modest (\u00fe3.0 hr per point, 95%CI: 0.7, 5.1, P \u00bc 0.01). Presence of cough at 3 weeks increased the odds of bronchiectasis (OR 3.0, 95%CI: 1.1, 7.0, P \u00bc 0.03). Factors associated with respiratory readmissions were: previous respiratory hospitalization (OR 2.3, 95%CI: 1.0, 5.4, P \u00bc 0.05) and household smoke (OR 2.6, 95%CI: 1.0, 6.3, P \u00bc 0.04). Conclusion: Increased severity score is associated with prolonged LOS in Indigenous children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. As persistent symptoms at 3 weeks post-hospitalization are associated with future diagnosis of bronchiectasis, optimising clinical care beyond hospitalization is needed to improve long-term respiratory outcomes for infants at risk of respiratory disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Bronchiolitis is typically a self-limiting illness, but causes considerable morbidity and remains a leading cause for hospitalization among infants worldwide. 1 The cost of hospitalized bronchiolitis has risen substantially in the USA over the last decade (increase of 34%). 2 There are many studies that have reported on the risk factors for severe disease and length of stay (LOS) in hospital, for example, prematurity and cardio-respiratory disease. 3 However, there is relatively little data on other factors (e.g. detection of bacteria with viruses) associated with LOS in hospital in an at-risk population (e.g., Indigenous children who have more severe bronchiolitis) 4 and future bronchiectasis. 5 Factors associated with severe illness and/or prolonged LOS include clinical severity (assessed by scoring systems), viruses, 1,3,6 and secondary bacterial infection. 7 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is implicated for 50-80% of cases and is associated with more severe disease in some studies [8] [9] [10] but not in others. 6 Whether single versus multiple viruses influence disease severity is also controversial. 11, 12 Further, a number of non-classical respiratory viruses (e.g. coronaviruses, bocaviruses) have been identified 13 but the clinical relevance of these remains unclear, as these non-classical viruses are commonly present in asymptomatic children. 14 In a hospital-based study, a virus (including non-classical viruses) was detected (42%) in the nasopharynx of children who did not have any respiratory symptoms. 14 Children with severe bronchiolitis requiring intensive care are likely to have a secondary bacterial infection. 7 However, studies on bronchiolitis to date have not examined whether the presence of respiratory bacteria in the upper airways influences clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Examination for bacteria is not routine in bronchiolitis management. However, it is plausible that secondary bacterial infection that occur post viral infections 15 are more likely when the nasopharynx is colonized with bacteria, as found in some populations such as in Northern Territory Indigenous infants. In these children, early (at $2 weeks of age), common (up to 90% of infants) and dense acquisition of respiratory bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) 16 have been documented. Thus, in study settings like ours, the presence of bacteria in the nasopharynx may be particularly relevant. Secondary bacterial infection may complicate bronchiolitis, and possibly contribute to poorer long-term outcomes such as chronic wet cough 17 and bronchiectasis. 18 It has been shown in children aged 3 years hospitalized with first time wheezing, co-detection of viruses (93%) and bacteria (60%) in nasopharyngeal aspirates resulted in prolonged LOS. 19 Yet, it remains unknown whether co-detection of bacteria with viruses in the nasopharynx at the point of bronchiolitis hospitalization contributes to LOS. This data is lacking and is especially important for populations at high risk of poorer outcomes (e.g. secondary bacterial pneumonia, chronic wet cough etc). 4, 17 Further rationale for assessing viruses and bacteria in the infants involved in our studies was described in a previous paper. 20 Beyond hospitalization, persistence of respiratory symptoms (i.e., post-bronchiolitis syndrome) is increasingly appreciated. 3, 21 Cohort studies report symptoms in up to 40% of infants, 14-25 days post-hospitalization. 3, 22 There are few data on what happens to these children in the medium term (4 weeks to 6 months). Determining the clinical relevance of symptoms beyond hospitalization is particularly important in populations, for example, Indigenous children who have a high risk of bronchiectasis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 160, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 275, "end": 276, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 453, "end": 454, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 675, "end": 676, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 704, "end": 705, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 873, "end": 874, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1009, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1014, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1035, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1128, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1131, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1244, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1378, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1543, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1657, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2022, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2367, "end": 2369, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2665, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2854, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3168, "end": 3170, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3171, "end": 3173, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3301, "end": 3303, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3429, "end": 3431, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3432, "end": 3434, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3524, "end": 3526, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3527, "end": 3529, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In the absence of any data from Indigenous children, we combined data from three prospective studies that included 232 Indigenous infants hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, to examine factors (clinical and microbiological) on admission that were associated with (i) prolonged LOS (Aim-1); (ii) presence of persistent symptoms 3 weeks after hospital discharge (Aim-2); (iii) whether presence of cough at 3 weeks was associated with bronchiectasis up to $24 months posthospitalisation (Aim-3); and (iv) re-hospitalization within 6 months for a respiratory illness (Aim-4).

Studies on hospitalized bronchiolitis in Canadian children found ethnicity, apnoea or respiratory arrest prior to hospitalization or pulmonary consolidation to have more complicated hospitalization. 27 Further, previous RSV bronchiolitis hospitalization was associated with chronic cough and recurrent respiratory infections in early childhood. 17 Well known or \"traditional risk factors\" associated with severe bronchiolitis in infants include prematurity, cardio-respiratory disease, and being Indigenous. 3, 28 In contrast, there are a few prospective studies which examined other factors that prolonged LOS. In these studies, factors significantly associated with prolonged LOS were young age, increased work of breathing, heart rate, respiratory rate, dehydration, hypoxia on admission, SpO2 <94%, respiratory distress assessment instrument (RDAI) score >11, apnoea, weight, RSV, ethnicity, and winter season. 27, [29] [30] [31] Retrospective studies have described that RSV, ethnicity, congenital syndromes, neuromuscular disorders and existing chronic respiratory diseases were associated with prolonged LOS. 32 In our study, severity score on admission, particularly use of accessory muscles, was the only factor to prolong LOS, once other factors (n\u00bc21) were accounted for in the multivariate regression. None of the previous studies however had dissected which component of the scoring system contributed the most to LOS. Further, despite the many studies undertaken for bronchiolitis, most scoring systems used were not validated. 6, 29, 32 Indeed the most commonly used system, the RDAI score, has limited validity when systematically examined. 33 Within our study, we had validated the scoring system used and showed good inter-and intrarater reliability. 24 The type and number of viruses (particularly RSV and HRV) did not significantly influence LOS in our study. Our results are similar to some studies, 9, 11 but dissimilar to others where RSV and/or HRV influenced disease severity. 8, 34, 35 Reasons for these variations are likely multi-factorial including sample size, different methodologies, sampling frame, age, number and types of viruses investigated. 11, 12 We also found that although respiratory bacteria (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis) and/or viruses were common (88%), their presence did not prolong LOS. While data relating to LOS and type of virus detection has been previously examined, none of these studies have examined the influence of the presence of bacteria in the upper airways. We found that the presence of bacteria detected in the nasopharynx with or without concurrent viruses did not influence LOS. Our finding of high prevalence of concurrent bacteria with viruses (i.e., 88%) in the children's nasopharynx is similar to that reported by Bisgaard and colleagues among young children of asthmatic mothers with acute wheeze in a non-hospitalised cohort. 36 Beyond the hospital phase, our study reported several novel outcomes. At 3 weeks post-hospitalisation, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in our study (20%) was similar to other studies (18-25%). 21, 22, 37 Few studies however have prospectively recorded respiratory symptoms post-hospitalization, and no studies have examined for predictors of persistent respiratory symptoms otherwise known as \"post-bronchiolitis syndrome.\" While presence of bacteria in the NPS on admission was not significantly associated with persistence of cough at 3 weeks, 36 chronic cough is the most common symptom of an underlying lung disease and causes poorer quality of life. 38 In this study, persistent cough was however a significant risk factor (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.0-7.0, P \u00bc 0.03) for CT-confirmed bronchiectasis 13 months later. Bronchiectasis is particularly common in Indigenous infants in the USA, Australia and New Zealand and hospitalization for respiratory disease is an independent risk factor. 18 In the context that early treatment of bacterial infections in the lower airways prevents long-term lung damage, 39, 40 our post-hospitalization data is both novel and important in high-risk population groups (e.g., Indigenous children). 18 Post-bronchiolitis syndrome is likely highly important especially in high-risk populations. Our data raises an important public health issue with respect to follow-up of children with bronchiolitis, to optimise clinical care beyond the immediate hospitalization phase to improve long-term respiratory outcomes for high-risk populations. We suggest that children should be clinically reviewed between weeks 3-4 after hospital discharge to assess for persistent symptoms and signs and managed accordingly. There is currently no high quality evidence on the most appropriate intervention in any groups of children with post-bronchiolitis syndrome. 41 However, until further evidence is available, we suggest the use of antibiotics when the cough is wet and not improving in a group at high risk of chronic suppurative lung disease, in line with the treatment of protracted bacterial bronchitis. 42 Our post-hospitalization data also showed that children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke and those previously hospitalized with a respiratory illness were twice as likely to be readmitted with a respiratory illness within 6 months of hospital discharge. Surprisingly, we found that presence of RSVon admission and \"any bacteria\" significantly reduced the odds of re-hospitalization by 6 months post index hospitalization. Whether respiratory readmissions in this population were related to the initial bronchiolitis episode, a new infection or other causes can only be postulated. One possible reason for this could be that RSV detection is a marker (as opposed to a cause) for future asthma and as the majority of paediatric asthma is mild, having asthma is less likely to lead to re-hospitalisation compared to a respiratory infection in our setting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 169, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 314, "end": 316, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 642, "end": 644, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 788, "end": 790, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 951, "end": 953, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 954, "end": 956, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1361, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1366, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1371, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1376, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1561, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1985, "end": 1987, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 1991, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 1994, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2100, "end": 2102, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2214, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2366, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2367, "end": 2369, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2445, "end": 2447, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2451, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2454, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2625, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2626, "end": 2628, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3363, "end": 3365, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3566, "end": 3569, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3570, "end": 3573, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3574, "end": 3576, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3919, "end": 3921, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4028, "end": 4030, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4357, "end": 4359, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4473, "end": 4476, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4477, "end": 4479, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 4598, "end": 4600, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 5246, "end": 5248, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 5493, "end": 5495, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study has several limitations. Firstly, our sampling frame is restricted to Indigenous children without the well-known, traditional risk factors (e.g. chronic lung disease, cardiac disease) and who did not require intensive care. Reasons for our sampling frame were discussed above but it also means our data cannot be extrapolated to the general population or to non-hospitalized infants. Secondly, we did not exclude infants that had been hospitalized previously; however, exclusion of these infants did not alter our main results. Thirdly, 87% of children received antibiotics during hospitalization. This may have impacted on nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage, however removing these children did not alter our main results. Fourthly, the children were systematically reviewed only at one time point, that is, at 3 weeks posthospitalization. The decision by the treating paediatricians who reviewed these infants at a median of 7 months post-hospitalization to subject the child to a chest CT scan was based on clinical assessments, not systemized and thus subject to external biases. Thus, we could not systematically analyze the factors on admission that are associated with future development of bronchiectasis. Also, while long-term, prospective, follow-up studies in high-risk populations are required, we cannot unethically subject all children to a chest CT (given the known risk of radiation in young children).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In the first prospective study of Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis with post-hospitalization data at 3 weeks and 6 months, we found that the severity score on admission, particularly accessory muscle use, was the sole factor associated with prolonged LOS once other factors (clinical and microbiological) were accounted for. Persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks increased the risk of detecting bronchiectasis and factors associated with persistent symptoms were prior hospitalisation for a respiratory illness and presence of bacteria on the NPS on admission. Thus, clinical review, with early treatment when necessary, should be undertaken in populations at high risk for chronic respiratory disease. Follow-up studies beyond 6 months are necessary to consolidate our findings and determine intervention points that can reduce the high burden of respiratory diseases in at-risk populations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSION"}, {"text": "Anne Chang conceptualized the study with modifications by Peter Morris and Gabrielle McCallum.
