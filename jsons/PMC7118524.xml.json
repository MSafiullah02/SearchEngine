There remain 14,831 confirmed cases (including 4,257 in serious condition) and 253 suspected cases still hospitalized. To date, 677,243 people have been identified as having had close contact with infected patients, of whom 13,701 are under medical observation [1]. Outside China, 44,067 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1,440 deaths have occurred in 117 countries, territories, or areas according to the World Health Organization [2]. COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health. Like the flu, COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In light of the infectious nature of this disease, health care workers are at high risk of infection of COVID-19. In China, health care workers account for 1,716 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including six deaths [3].",

Of these, 3,083 people underwent fever-CT examinations. Including the initial examination and reexamination, the total number of fever CT examination numbered 3,340. The fever-CT scanned a patient approximately every 21.5 min. As a result of our precautions, none of the staff of the radiology department developed symptoms suspicious for COVID-19. The fever-CT technologist, with the highest probability of exposure, remains negative per polymerase chain reaction.",

Currently, the Chinese people are panicking again. The speed and extent by which COVID-19 has spread in 2 months are unprecedented, beyond those of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and this has been aided by its contagious nature and rapid spread via droplets and contact. The droplet mode of transmission means that a person can be infected easily by means of casual contact or even fomites on contaminated environmental surfaces. Another theory has yet to be proved: aerosol propagation.",

All typical and atypical imaging features of the disease should be made known to all radiologists to assist in recognition of the disease on images and to allow accurate reporting of these findings. We have stored images of all probable cases of COVID-19 in the PACS so that these images were readily available for any radiologist to review, and images from previous imaging studies are also available for comparison.",

But when combined with other epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and virus nucleic acid information, typical chest CT imaging findings are helpful for making the diagnosis. In our opinion, the major role of chest CT is to understand the extent and dynamic evolution of lung lesions induced by COVID-19. The reasons we adopted the low-dose chest CT scan protocol are as follows: low-dose chest CT has been widely used in the screening of early lung cancer. It is well known that many early lung cancers are ground-glass opacities, so we believe that low-dose screening is also applicable for COVID-19. In addition, considering the rapid development of COVID-19, many CT examinations may be conducted in the same individual to monitor disease progress. Low-dose scanning can reduce the radiation damage to patients.",

However, we believe that our experience in management, the reconfiguration of our radiology department, and the workflow changes implemented in the current COVID-19 situation are useful for other radiology departments that must prepare for dealing with patients with COVID-19.
