Worldwide, healthcare workers (HCWs) make up 12% of the workforce [2] and face high occupational risk. In December 2019, Dr. Yang Wen of Beijing Civil Aviation General Hospital passed away as a result of a severe violent injury inflicted by a patient, this aroused public concern for the occupational health (OH) of HCWs. A healthcare worker (HCW) is defined as any individual whose work is in a medical environment; it includes but is not limited to doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, operation theater technicians, community healthcare workers, pharmacists, etc. [3]. However, HCWs who fight for others\u2019 health may encounter risks from strenuous manual labor, infectious diseases, chemical hazards, and irrational patients, which has attracted the attention of society, scholars, public health practitioners, and healthcare managers [4,5].",

            "text": "Studies on healthcare workers\u2019 occupational health (HCWs+OH) are conducted from diverse perspectives. Infectious factors and musculoskeletal injuries caused while shifting patients have attracted the attention of employee OH programs thus far. Yip et al. [6] and Petit et al. [7] summarized that the prevalence of musculoskeletal injury (MSI) was high among HCWs, and those who often manually carry patients had a higher risk of injury than those who did not. It is inevitable for HCWs to expose themselves to patients\u2019 blood as well other body fluids (OEB) which may be caused by direct contact with patients who suffer from needlestick injuries [8] and sharp object damage [9]. Mucocutaneous engagement with the body fluids of the patients [10] could lead to the potential of catching infectious diseases, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for instance [11]; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [12], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [13], Ebola virus [14] and tuberculosis (TB) are also cases in point [15,16]. Patz et al. [17] put forward that surgeons, obstetricians and gynecologists were the group with the highest exposure rate. Chiodi et al. [18] and Oltulu et al. [19] discussed that industry hazards, biopharma products and other chemical hazards had been recognized as risk factors for HCWs. Additionally, natural rubber latex (NRL) products, especially examination gloves, were frequently employed in the medical environment [20]. Verna et al. [21] concluded that latex allergy had become an occupational hazard for HCWs; furthermore, allergies and exposure levels could be seen as predisposing factors for latex sensitization.",

It has been defined by the health sector as a violent attack on workers in the general field [22,23,24]. Workplace violence can potentially cause mental problems like depression, inferiority and demotivation [25,26,27]. Ito et al. [28] conducted one analysis of the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire and found that the \"total health risk\" of HCWs was 10% higher than the national average. Due to organizational factors and the deficiency in social support at work, HCWs may experience occupational stress, which may cause burnout or psychosomatic diseases. Demou et al. [29] concluded that mental health conditions, depression particularly, were a prominent cause of the absence of many HCWs. Moreover, reflecting the prevalence of chronic diseases and increasing health care costs, more people were receiving treatment domestically, which would largely increase the requirement for home healthcare workers (HHCWs) [30]. Increasing work intensity, adverse working conditions, motor vehicle traffic and precarious work arrangements together contributed to high injuries for HHCWs [31,32,33].",

Therefore, dedication to the overall progress of HCWs+OH objectively and quantitatively is quite significant both in theory and in practice. This study intends to analyze HCWs+OH research during 1992\u20132019 via bibliometric and social network analysis (SNA) method, comprehensively, with aims as follows: (1) identify the evolution and characteristic of research outputs, research area distribution, international collaboration, author productivity and collaboration; (2) highlight the hotspots of the HCWs+OH field based on keyword co-occurrence frequencies and hierarchical cluster analysis; (3) track the trend via per-document co-citation, highly cited articles, and cluster timeline visualization. This study is expected to provide researchers, public health practitioners, and healthcare managers with a systematic and comprehensive understanding of HCWs+OH research and a reference for further research as well.",

The update of the WOSCC database was considered in the retrieval, with the time span being limited to 1992\u20132019. Eventually, a total of 402 academic journal articles were retrieved from the WOSCC database at the retrieval time of May 13, 2019, and processed by the Notepad++ software (developed by Don Ho, a free source code editor) initially.",

The main aspects of conducting a bibliometric analysis include Performance Analysis and Science Mapping [37]. Performance Analysis is based on the analysis of bibliometrics and evaluates the types, publication years, journals, research areas, countries and other characteristics of publications. Science Mapping is designed to indicate the structure of the research field. By using the Science Mapping tool CiteSpace (developed by Chaomei Chen, Drexel University, PA, USA), which can be used to visualize the knowledge structure in specific areas [38], this study analyzed the international collaboration and document co-citation to present research collaboration network and research trends of HCWs+OH. In order to more accurately predict the trend of the publication years, the time series method was also adopted. The time series method is to analyze time series data with calculated data in unified time space as foundation, to find out the significant statistics and properties of data and predict future events [39].",

Keyword co-occurrence analysis functions as an effective way to track research topics, as keywords provide a high-level summary of the article which enables researchers to acquire deeper comprehension of the current situation in specific fields [42]. In this study, BibExcel [43] was applied to analyze each paper. The bibliography was used to calculate authors\u2019 productivity and keyword co-occurrence matrix. Pajek [44] was used to generate an author collaboration network and calculate the centralities, namely degree centrality (DC), betweenness centrality (BC) and closeness centrality (CC). The measurement of a node\u2019s centrality represents the importance of the node in the network. The BC measures the node\u2019s ability to connect with other nodes in the network, while CC measures how easy it is for a node to reach other nodes, and DC measures how many directly linked nodes a node has [45]. UCINET (Analytic Technologies, Kentucky, USA) was employed to manage keywords co-occurrence matrices, and NetDraw (Analytic Technologies, Kentucky, USA) was another application for the generating of keyword co-occurrence network [43]. In addition, the statistical software SPSS (IBM, New York, USA) was used to generate keyword co-occurrence hieratical clusters, which can make further efforts to indicate the present research hotspots of HCWs+OH.",

The starting period from 1992 to 2006 was quite stable, with the annual number of publications being basically the same (on average, five articles per year). There were only two articles (1.47%) published in 1992. In the 2007 year, demarcated as the debut of the second interval, the number of publications increased to 16 articles, and for the following years the publication maintained an average of 21 articles till 2014. The last period showed the greatest increase, starting from 2015 with 36 articles (3.55%) published, and the number of publications reached a peak of 43 (3.86%) in 2016, with an average of 41 articles per year from 2015 to 2018.",

The publication percentage can be considered as an indicator of future topic prevalence in the OH research field. According to the ARIMA model, research on HCWs+OH may continue to increase in the next decade. It was predicted that the number of articles related to HCWs+OH may reach 87 in 2027, accounting for 4.10% of OH research per year.

O\u2019Donnell MR et al.

The other articles from Cluster 0 were published by Baussano I et al. and studied TB among HCWs from different perspectives. Baussano I et al. [69] drew the conclusion that the risk for acquiring TB HCWs suffers is consistently much higher than that of the general mass worldwide. These were followed by articles by Joshi R et al. and Naidoo S et al. which also belong to Cluster 0. Joshi R et al. [3] summarized that it was a necessity to devise and implement a more effective and affordable TB infection-control programs in healthcare facilities especially in countries with low- and middle-income.

The working conditions have been seen as a determinant of HCWs+OH due to structural changes. Among the various risks identified in working conditions, such as environmental, psychological, toxicology, and physical risks are challenges to the HCWs+OH research field [79,80]. The psychological issues of HCWs may be caused by work-related risks and poor psychosocial work factors [81]. The European Commission defines the following as psychosocial risks: time pressure, strict hierarchy, lack of satisfaction, support and remuneration; insufficient leadership of personnel, irregular work, social conflicts, violence and aggression, low doctor\u2013patient communication skills. Moreover, occupational violence and aggression have received increasing attention in the field of HCWs & OH research, not only because this is the expectation of social work safety and dignity, but also because the violence has a physiological or emotional impact that exceeds the violent event itself [27].",

Contaminated or stained sharp objects like needles might bring percutaneous injuries to HCWs considering high exposure under such surroundings [75]. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, HCWs constituted almost half of the confirmed cases in Canada [83]. Similarly, occupational exposure explains nearly 40% of Hepatitis B and C in HCWs [84]. Moreover, exposed in the medical environment, HCWs are confronted with a rather high risk of TB [68] and the much more deadly Ebola as well [85]. This TB risk is elevated among HCWs [86] in South Africa hospitals, where TB outbreaks caused severe death [87] with the HCWs three to ten times more likely to acquire TB as per some studies [88].",

(1) Lack of comprehensive and systematic research on the evaluation system of HCWs+OH. Most of the existing HCWs+OH evaluation systems are based on a single factor, disease, or aim to carry out statistical or investigative research on the current situation of OH, which inevitably lacks in general applicability, so a comprehensive and systematic study of the HCWs+OH evaluation system is needed. (2) Lack of research on the information system of HCWs+OH. Although information systems are widely used in health sectors around the world, few initiatives have been made for HCWs+OH [89]. The implementation and application of information systems is a resource-intensive undertaking and needs to be elaborated on in the future. (3) Research on HHCWs should receive more attention. In view of the aging of the population, the increasing cost of chronic diseases and health care, more people need to be treated at home, which increases the demand for more HHCWs [30]. HHCWs may also be injured by musculoskeletal disorders [90], stress [33], exposure [91], etc. in the process of work, but existing research is far from a clear understanding of the OH of HHCWs; therefore, clear research on the OH of HHCWs is necessary.",
