There have been few studies about SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with other pathogens. In this retrospective study, 257 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu Province were enrolled from January 22 to February 2, 2020. They were re-confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and tested for 39 respiratory pathogens. In total, 24 respiratory pathogens were found among the patients, and 242 (94.2 %) patients were co-infected with one or more pathogens. Bacterial co-infections were dominant in all COVID-19 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The highest and lowest rates of co-infections were found in patients aged 15-44 and below 15, respectively. Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease. In addition, the proportion of viral co-infections, fungal co-infections and bacterial-fungal co-infections were the highest severe COVID-19 cases. These results will provide a helpful reference for diagnosis and clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients.",

In addition to bacteria, fungi was also a major factor of co-infection secondary to viral infections such as seen in influenza infection in which A. baumannii, Aspergillus, Candida and KP were discovered as common secondary infections (Gao, et al. 2013; Guo, et al. 2019) . In this study, the highest rates of co-infection with bacteria and fungi were found among severe and critical category. Some of pathogens are known antibiotic resistance which may make the treatment of COVID-19 patients more difficult. Wang et al. studied 104 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that 3 (2.88 %) patients were co-infected with other coronavirus, 2 (1.94 %) were co-infected with influenza A . In this study, we also found a few of influenza A, influenza B co-infections, but no coronavirus was detected. These results indicated that the co-infections with influenza A, influenza B or coronavirus were not common in COVID-19 patients, though the seasonal influenza is now prevalent. However, influenza A, influenza B co-infections may increase the risks of COVID-19 patients. Influenza vaccination is still recommended. It was notable that the positive rates of HAdV and HRV were higher than that of influenza viruses. HAdV and HRV are associated with lower mortality, but significant higher morbidity, causing a huge economic burden (Fendrick, et al. 2003) . EBV and HSV were the common pathogens carried by adults. The effects of their roles in the process of COVID-19 need to be explored. CMV, HBoV, and HMPV were important pathogens of respiratory tract infection in children. However, only a few of them were found co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The virus co-infection could cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and demonstrate overlapped clinical presentations. Thus, other viruses should also be considered while diagnosing and treating SARS-CoV-2. Similar co-infection rate and pathogens in females was found when compared with males which mean both man and women are susceptible to other respiratory pathogens. The species of co-infected pathogens were higher between patients of 15-64 years old than that of below 15 years and above 65 years of age. We also found that the rates of influenza, HRV, and HAdV co-infection were higher among cases of 15-64 years old which was different from the previous studies in which the pathogens were found mainly affecting the young and aged people. It may be due to the decreased immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The highest Co-infection rate and the most pathogen species were detected in cases of 1-4 days after onset. Along with the course of disease, both the rates and pathogen species of co-infection among COVID-19 patients were decreased significantly, which may due to the treatment X. Zhu, et al. Virus Research 285 (2020) 198005 the patients received. We noticed that a high co-infection rate and pathogen species in patients of -4-0 days after onset, which indicated asymptomatic category also have high co-infection opportunity although the pathogen species was the lowest, and early treatment should be taken for them. Pathogen species was also not high in severe/critical category, which may attribute to all of them have been taken medical intervention.",
