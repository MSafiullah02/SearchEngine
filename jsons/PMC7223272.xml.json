            "text": "There is a long history of modelling disease dynamics, starting with the basic SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick 1927; Brauer and Castillo-Chavez 2012). This model has been modified, critiqued, and analysed for nearly a century. Its limitations have inspired work that seeks to account for additional features of real epidemics. For example, economic epidemiology is used to model individuals who calculate the costs and benefits of their actions and are motivated by pessimism (Auld 2003), personal gain (Fenichel et al. 2011), or a planning horizon (Nardin et al. 2016). Other models are more behaviour-based and incorporate the effect of fear (Epstein et al. 2008) or study how the spread of awareness impacts the course of a disease (Funk et al. 2009).",

Much of this research focuses on opinions regarding vaccination. While vaccination is one type of prophylactic behaviour, it is characteristically different than others, such as hand washing, face-mask wearing, or social distancing. Unlike vaccination, these latter behaviours require high frequencies of affirmation or engagement; hands need to be washed after contact with potentially contaminated areas, face masks need to be worn on a daily basis, etc. Hence, the dynamics of opinions regarding vaccination are expected to be substantively different than the dynamics of these other prophylactic behaviours. Consider, for example, the behaviour of populations before and after the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Arrival of the disease resulted in a sharp increase in face-mask use (Lau et al. 2005), and when the disease disappeared so, largely, did the face masks (though other hygienic behaviours such as hand washing may be more persistent (Fung and Cairncross 2007)). Similar changes in behaviour have been documented during influenza epidemics (Sadique et al. 2007; Goodwin et al. 2011). A general increase in public hygienic behaviours has been shown to be important in reducing the spread of disease.",

            "text": "We are interested in understanding the feedbacks between opinion and disease dynamics, where the opinions in question are related to prophylactic behaviours such as hand washing, face-mask wearing, or social distancing. In order to make headway in this regard, we study a model that couples opinion dynamics with a basic SIR model. We combine our earlier opinion dynamics model (Baumgaertner et al. 2018) with an SIR framework to study how attitudes regarding prophylactic behaviour affect the course of a disease for which vaccination is not an option. Unlike economic models, behaviours in our model are not based on personal utilities. Instead, we assume that constructive conversations can lead to opinion-changing processes, and that therefore people are susceptible to persuasion by others. It is known that human behaviour and opinions during an outbreak can be motivated by messages from the media or social circles. For example, it has been observed that a fear of infection can spread during an outbreak due to the influence of media, government policy, or word-of-mouth communications (Wasswa 2012; Young et al. 2008; Damme and Lerberghe 2000; Saadatian-Elahi et al. 2010). Fear of infection has been modelled by Epstein et al. (Epstein et al. 2008) using two contagion processes: one for fear and another for disease. Our model provides an opinion-based perspective to such behaviour, with levels of infection influencing which opinions have more weight.",

            "text": "We recognize that there are many obstacles present in modelling behavioural responses to epidemics due to the assumptions and generalizations involved in describing population behaviour (Funk et al. 2010, 2015). The challenges of modelling, however, have not deterred the development of models that include various ways of representing health-related beliefs and attitudes (Bauch and Earn 2004; Bauch and Galvani 2013; Epstein et al. 2008; Ferguson 2007; Funk et al. 2009; Perrings et al. 2014; Philipson 2000; Manfredi and D\u2019Onofrio 2013; Mao and Yang 2012; Wang et al. 2015; Basu et al. 2008; Bauch and Bhattacharyya 2012; Fenichel et al. 2011; Perra et al. 2011; Del Valle et al. 2013; P\u00e9rez-Llanos et al. 2018). This wealth of approaches demonstrates the complexity of the interaction between infectious disease, attitudes (or opinions or beliefs), and behaviour. This complexity highlights the nuances within which public policy decisions are (and need to be) made. We are optimistic that our modelling, in conjunction with other epidemic models, makes informative contributions to public policy (Mansnerus 2015; Anderson and May 1992). More specifically, our model may be informative when considering the flux of opinions in response to the waxing and waning of disease risk, and the decision to intervene with severe control measures (Ferguson et al. 2001, 2005; Flahault et al. 2006).",

The effect of amplification, absent a disease system, was studied by Baumgaertner et al. (2018). In brief, increased rates of amplification lead to decreased time to consensus of opinion in a well-mixed system. One of the effects we study in this paper is the impact that amplification can have in a coupled opinion\u2013disease system.",

The result of such an interaction is determined by the relative positions of the two attitudes in the attitude spectrum and whether or not opinion amplification occurs. Amplification, which was introduced in our earlier work on opinion dynamics (Baumgaertner et al. 2016, 2018), provides a mechanism by which individuals gain confidence in their opinion when they encounter like-minded individuals. Opinion amplification is the tendency to entrench or increase the strength of an opinion when interacting with other like-minded individuals. The inclusion of amplification in our model is motivated by studies of related biases, including biased assimilation and confirmation bias (Lord et al. 1979; Miller et al. 1993; Munro et al. 2002; Taber and Lodge 2006; Jonas et al. 2001; Wason 1960, 1968). The underlying idea is that one\u2019s current opinion biases revisions of that opinion by differentially weighting consistent and contrary information (relative to the opinion).",

In other words, opinions change based on the frequencies of other susceptibles; infection level regulates probabilities of encountering different types of susceptibles, but it does not have a direct effect on opinion formation; there is no I term in any of the opinion terms in the ODEs except through the influence functions. Also note that the encounters could include simply seeing someone who displays the outward signs of their opinion, e.g. someone wearing a face mask. Finally, note that infective and recovered individuals have no opinions; at least, nobody listens to them.

We expect faster infection rates to lead to larger epidemics, absent the influence of opinion dynamics.

The baseline for comparison is shown in Fig. 4. We see that the faster opinion dynamics (Fig. 8, first row) have an effect that is similar to that of increased amplification (Fig. 5). Final size is significantly decreased in the simulations with opinion dynamics (especially saturating opinion dynamics) in comparison with the no-influence case. Peak size is also reduced. Epidemic duration is reduced for the cases of saturating opinion dynamics. For the linear opinion dynamics, epidemic duration is increased/decreased at lower/higher initial levels of prophylaxis. When infection rates are also increased (Fig. 8, second row), completely new behaviours emerge. Final size again increases, but most dramatically for the reverse-order saturating influence case.

Peak size increases in all cases, and epidemic duration becomes monotonic, never dropping to zero.

Mathematical and computational models of the interplay between disease spread and opinions have been gaining attention, but the subject is still in its infancy. While it is relatively straightforward to model some of the effects of behaviour on disease spread, human behaviour and opinion dynamics are far too complex to model with anything approaching precision or completeness. Consequently, opinion dynamics models currently take an approach of greatly reducing complexity, with the hope of gaining insight into certain aspects of opinion formation and spread. This strategy parallels those in other sciences, such as biology. Instead of approaching the problem with models or experiments involving many ecological interactions in natural habitats, (mathematical) biologists started with one predator and one prey, or two competitors, in an idealized habitat that controlled for most variables. This approach allowed biologists to learn a great deal by first studying greatly reduced systems. Similarly, while opinion dynamics models can be criticized as being too simplistic, the upshot is tractability.",

The opinion dynamics we adopt assume that constructive conversations between individuals can lead to changes in opinions through persuasion, but that persuasion is also sensitive to information about the risk of infection. In addition, the opinion dynamics we use also can capture the effects of echo chambers and amplification (ascertainment bias)\u2014features that are especially prevalent in social media.

What we learn from this exploration is that these features can interact with each other and the disease dynamics, and in turn their impact on epidemiological outcomes, such as final epidemic size, is not straightforward. For example, some influence functions will have populations respond more rapidly to initial increases in infectives (e.g. saturating influence), but that does not entail a larger decrease in final epidemic size. As shown in Sect. 3.2, it also matters whether the population starts with a majority of prophylactic or non-prophylactic opinions. If the initial majority is non-prophylactic, then some influence functions (e.g. reverse-order saturating) will yield the strongest reduction in final epidemic size.",

The importance of these feedbacks was also identified by Collinson and Heffernan (2014) in their study of models for the effect of mass media on the course of an influenza epidemic. The situation they consider is different from ours, as their models all have a vaccinated subpopulation that cannot return to the unvaccinated state, and the population infectivity immediately responds to I(t), without waiting for opinion dynamics to shift. Consistent with our work, however, they find that the different response functions predict epidemic dynamics that can differ in important ways. Our work sheds light on how opinion dynamics and influence functions couple with disease dynamics and can perhaps inform future development of reliable media functions.",

In real populations, spatial and network structure, as well as other heterogeneities, can render some pockets of the population less susceptible and stop the epidemic sooner than is predicted by ODE models. The opinion dynamics model used here has been shown (Baumgaertner et al. 2016, 2018) to behave very differently in spatial and well-mixed systems. In particular, opinion amplification and spatial structure can conspire to lead to clustering of opinions and polarization, with opinion dynamics essentially freezing once the system becomes sufficiently polarized. With enough mixing, on the other hand, the behaviour changes to one in which opinions can rapidly tip to one side. It is thus likely that incorporating spatial structure into our SIR-Opinion Dynamics model could lead to different outcomes. With sufficient clustering and polarization of opinions, a spatial version of the model could lead to segregation of the population into spatially contiguous regions that are highly susceptible and others that have low susceptibility. Here, again, the relative time scales for disease and opinion spread (as well as different mechanisms for the spread of information and opinions) are likely to influence the outcomes. We leave the construction and analysis of such models for future work.\n",
