            "text": "At the end of 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and the epidemic spread rapidly to all 34 provinces in China within 1 month. The new pneumonia was quickly confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and the WHO named it the novel coronavirus disease: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. Among the patients with COVID-19, the most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%) [1]. On Feb 11, 2020, among a total of 44 672 confirmed cases, 5% became critical cases, and the case-fatality rate was 2.9% in Hubei and 0.4% outside Hubei [2]. On Feb 29, 2020, the case-fatality rate was 1.4% among 1099 patients from 30 provinces in China with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 [1]. To date, no treatments or vaccines have been proven to be effective for COVID-19, and there is unlikely to be a viable vaccine for at least another 12\u201318 months [3]. On Feb 28, the WHO raised the COVID-19 risk to \u2018very high\u2019 at the global level. As of Mar 2, 2020, the WHO had reported a total of 88 948 confirmed cases and 2915 deaths in China and 8774 confirmed cases and 128 deaths in 64 other countries [4]. The uncertain case-fatality rate and explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2 caused a great psychological reaction among the public, including anxiety, fear, panic, anger, and depression.",

As of Jan 24, 2020, southwestern China, including Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province and, Yunnan Province, have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. Rapid measures have been taken to isolate confirmed or suspected patients and trace and quarantine their close contacts. Situation updates of COVID-2019 and health information have been widely disseminated through TV, internet, radio, and newspapers, and even broadcast on the streets and in villages. The government has encouraged civilians to reduce their going out and gathering. In this situation, many industries have suffered property damage worth hundreds of millions of yuan. The Chinese government has introduced some policies to compensate the losses of enterprises and individuals by reducing taxes, providing low-interest loan support, and full refunds for individuals who already purchased a ticket for public transportation.",

Zhang reported that the rates of depression, neurasthenia, fear, anxiety, and hypochondriasis were 36.40%, 37.21%, 79.70%, 33.41%, and 27.69%, respectively, among 2709 civilians in Zhejiang Province during the outbreak of human H7N9 avian influenza [7]. The National Health Commission of China promulgated the notification of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions for COVID-2019 on Jan 26, 2020 [8]. This notification stated that the public might experience panic, disappointment, and anger, especially those who had confirmed or suspected infection of SARS-CoV-2; that people who were in quarantine might experience anxiety, discrimination, boredom, loneliness, guilt, and stigma; and that mental health support should be provided for the public in need. Then, online psychological counseling services and psychological assistance hot-lines were rapidly established by mental health professionals in medical institutions, universities, and academic societies throughout all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China, which provide free 24-h services every day including weekends, as well as providing psychological self-help intervention systems and artificial intelligence (AI) programs for psychological crises intervention [9].",

If those reactions cannot be relieved in time, they are likely to lead to further irrational behaviors, such as the panic buying of materials in Beijing during SARS, the rush for salt during the Fukushima nuclear leak in Japan, and more serious violent behavior [10]. Although the epidemic was in a rapid outbreak stage, some individuals seemed to remain unaware of the true danger of SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear whether there is any difference in psychological response between individuals who directly felt the threat of COVID-2019 (were quarantined or their acquaintance were quarantined) and people who were not directly affected by the epidemic. Anxiety and mood disorders are the most common mental health problems in the general population all over the world [11], and there are important connections between anxiety and depression and occurrence of viral diseases [12]. However, the epidemiological data on the Chinese general population remain unavailable, and how to best respond to challenges during the outbreak is unknown [13]. Therefore, determining the prevalence of anxiety and depression, as well as differences and associated factors among the public, is the first important step for implementing early targeted intervention, reducing the possibility of further irrational behaviors and helping people return to normal life. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among people affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020.",

In the Chinese public, the index score has the following 4 categories [15]: no anxiety (lower than 50); low anxiety (50~59); moderate anxiety (60~69), and severe anxiety (higher than 70).

For example, 39% the public expressed anxiety about avian influenza in France [18], 48% of the general public had anxiety-depression symptoms after over 1 year of Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone [19], 73% of residents had low mood and 57% had irritability during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong [20], 16% of the public felt anxious during the early stage of the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in the Netherlands [21], and the percentage of \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018fairly\u2019 worried people in the general population fluctuated between 9.6% and 32.9% during the swine flu outbreak in the UK [22]. Possible reasons for these differences are as follows. First, the Chinese government took quick and strong measures to ensure citizens\u2019 sense of security and frequently disseminated situation updates of COVID-19. Rapidly sharing information about the epidemic is an effective way to reduce public panic [23]. Second, people have a high cognitive level of COVID-19. The general population\u2019s level of knowledge about the disease plays an important role in reaction to an epidemic crisis [18, 24]. In our study, 77.3% of participants thought they had a higher level of knowledge about COVID-19, and the result is consistent with the knowledge test on COVID-19 (the total score was 20), on which 70.13% scored above 15 [25]. Third, China quickly established a psychological assistance system, and 40.4% of participants in this study had received psychological support or counseling. The system might be an effective way to relieve negative emotions of the public. Finally, a possible reason might be the use of different instruments and cut-off points to measure anxiety and depression, different stages of epidemic development, exposure to different epidemics, different study designs, and different cultural backgrounds.",

Those with low average household income lack the ability to face economic risks; in addition, being quarantined means that they are unable to deal with financial problems by going back to work or applying for a loan, and they cannot estimate how long this impact may last. These may be factors that triggered more anxiety and depression.",

            "text": "In the unaffected group, the high level of anxiety was related to a high self-evaluated level of knowledge about COVID-19. This is an unexpected result, and Purohit et al. also reported that greater knowledge about Zika significantly predicted Zika-related anxiety levels [31].Given the cross-sectional features of the study, the possibility that some anxious participants coped with their anxiety by seeking knowledge and information about the disease may have caused sampling bias. Our study showed the self-evaluated level of knowledge, not an individual\u2019s actual knowledge. We could not differentiate whether it is one\u2019s actual knowledge that was related with anxiety in this study, but Purohit et al. suggested that the perception of one\u2019s own knowledge is more strongly related to health anxiety than one\u2019s actual knowledge [31]. Another reason might be that the participants had misconceptions about COVID-19 caused by false propaganda, rumors, and defamation. Misconceptions can provoke anxiety, such as one report that caused the panicked buying \u2018Shuanghuanglian\u2019 (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) among the general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Lienemann et al. reported that during the H1N1 epidemic in India, media reporting of inaccurate information contributed to widespread anxiety, fear, and panic in the general public [32]. We also found that a high level of depression was correlated with having no psychological support or counseling from the community/government agencies. The individuals who had depression symptoms instead tended to not seek help [33,34]. Their perception of stigma and embarrassment and their preference for self-reliance were the most important barriers to help-seeking [35]. Therefore, enhancing public knowledge about mental disorders is essential to increase help-seeking behavior [36].",

The higher levels of anxiety and depression might mean that there was a higher psychological impact caused by the additional economic impact of the disease. People who suffer economic loss have to bear the pressure of the loss and they also have to face the problem of how to recover the economic loss. Having poor health was associated with a high level of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic. Having poor health makes one more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, especially according to the news report that the infection is more likely to infect older men with comorbidities and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, such as ARDS [37]. In addition, some people who need medical support, such as patients with chronic diseases or cancer, cannot obtain medical resources in time during the COVID-19 epidemic. A study reported that individuals who are able to maintain better health, even under stressful epidemic situations, are more likely to resist the consequent mental impact [6]. Chongqing is contiguous to Hubei Province, so there are frequent population exchanges and, consequently, frequent virus transmission. People\u2019s mental responses were more strongly aroused by the geographical proximity. Shi et al. reported a similar result in north China during the SARS epidemic [38].",

Its sampling design is subject to many of the usual biases of internet-based surveys, and the sample is not necessarily representative of the general population. In addition, we did not consider other factors that may have confounded the outcomes, such as the actual level of knowledge about COVID-19 and the social support of family and friends, which are commonly considered to be associated with anxiety and depression. Finally, we only roughly divided the population into an \u2018affected group\u2019 and an \u2018unaffected group\u2019 according to their quarantine situation, and we did not conduct a subgroup analysis between population with different exposure levels. Future studies should delve deeper into those issues. The strength of the study is its use of timely data from a large number of respondents at the early stage in the COVID-19 epidemic and its scientific importance for the study of mental response and early intervention during the early stage of an epidemic of a novel virus.",
