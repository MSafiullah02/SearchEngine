Rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the corner stone of all efforts to stem its advance ment. Molecular detection via RT-PCR can result in falsely negative results due to the low viral loads in a sample. Serological methods are being developed and have proven to be a useful supplementary approach in confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2 The US Food and Drug Administration has issued numerous Emergency Use Authorisations, including serological tests; however, the potential for crossreactivity with antibodies present in the sera of patients with other diseases remains largely unknown. Cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with antibodies against other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, has been shown. 3 In addition, cross-reactivity has been observed from auto antibodies in serum samples from patients with autoimmune disease when testing for SARS-CoV, 4 which shares high sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2. As such, we wanted to determine whether autoantibodies interfere with detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",
