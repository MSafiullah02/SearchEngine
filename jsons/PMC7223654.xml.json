The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided criteria for \u2018clinically defined pneumonia\u2019 established and verified for the definition of healthcare (HAP)- and community (CAP)-associated pneumonia [8]. However, current standards for disease-specific acute management of SCI have not yet implemented such pathways [9, 10]. Moreover, the pathophysiology of SCI-AP is complex. Independently of risk factors such as mechanical ventilation or loss of the expiratory intercostal and abdominal muscle function with subsequent decrease of vital capacity and cough [11], the increased susceptibility to SCI-AP is additionally facilitated by the Spinal Cord Injury-induced Immune Deficiency Syndrome (SCI-IDS) [12\u201314], characterized through a neuroanatomical lesion-height dependent decrease in antibody synthesis and cellular immune-response leading to impaired host defence [15\u201317]. In the context of the SCI-IDS, some diagnostic CDC-criteria for a \u2018clinically defined pneumonia\u2019, e.g. leucocyte counts, are substantially altered due to SCI itself [13, 14] and may therefore be of limited significance for the diagnosis of SCI-AP.",

The departments were selected from university hospitals and specialized non-university SCI-care centres organized within the German-speaking Society for Paraplegia (DMGP). Departments which had indicated not to treat people with SCI in a recent previous nationwide SCI-survey [18] conducted by the study group were excluded. University-affiliated teaching hospitals located off-campus were also withdrawn from the study sample as they had indicated only a \u201csporadic\u201d treatment of individuals with SCI (<10/year) in the previous survey and thus were not representing departments with established SCI-care algorithms. The survey was addressed to the medical directors of the departments hosting responsibility for the clinical practice in their centres. The medical directors filled the questionnaire personally, which in most cases included consultations with the respective physician team of the department.

Section one assessed care provider profiles, i.e. numbers of treated SCI cases per year, department size, existence of standard operating procedures (SOP) for SCI-AP. Section two provided eight case vignettes of acute traumatic SCI in adult individuals specifying common clinical situations with varying information on parameters relevant for diagnosis of \u2018clinically defined pneumonia\u2019 according to CDC-criteria (also referred to as PNU1) [8]. The diagnostic algorithm for \u2018clinically defined pneumonia\u2019 comprises combinations of the following timely available clinical and laboratory parameters: leukopenia or leucocytosis, altered mental status in patients \u226570 years of age, fever >38 \u00b0C, new onset or changes in purulent sputum or respiratory secretions, new onset of cough/dyspnoea, pathological auscultatory findings, worsening gas exchange such as O2 desaturations, increased O2 requirements, or increased ventilator demand, tachypnea, and new or progressive infiltrations, consolations or cavitation in chest X-ray [8]. In addition to the CDC-criteria, information on age, comorbidities, mechanical ventilation, neurological level of SCI, and the injury completeness as classified by the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) was provided in the case vignettes (Fig. 1). The clinicians were asked to decide (a) whether the patient suffered from SCI-AP, (b) if antibiotic treatment should be initiated, and (c) if further parameters were needed to decide on the diagnosis of SCI-AP. Section three examined the type of antibiotic treatment, its duration, and monitoring as well as the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and prevention of aspiration/dysphagia. The questionnaire was designed by two authors (CD, JMS). In order to carve out putative misunderstandings or inconsistencies, and evaluate the acceptance, four authors representing specialist physicians and/or clinical scientists experienced in stroke or SCI-care and research (AM, AN, TL, MAK) were assigned the task.",

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to explore effects of SOPs on diagnosis and management of SCI-AP. These analyses were performed using the software GraphPad Prism, Version 5.0. The classification and regression trees (CART) method was used to investigate the relevance of specific parameters in diagnostic decision-making [20]. All information provided by the case vignettes (Fig. 1), particularly all CDC-criteria applicable for diagnosis of \u2018clinically defined pneumonia\u2019, were included in the model using the target variable \u2018diagnosis of SCI-AP\u2019. In addition, the department was included as a random effect to account for the individual departments\u2019 tendency to diagnose SCI-AP for different case vignettes. As a sensitivity analysis the regression tree was calculated first with and second without the random effect for the individual department. CART analysis splits the data towards an increase in purity of the subsequent nodes considering the contribution of the input variables to the classification. For description of the increase in purity of the nodes, the relative and absolute increase in the number of correctly classified cases were indicated. In addition, we calculated an improvement score characterizing the decrease of impurity of the nodes based on the Gini Index [21].
