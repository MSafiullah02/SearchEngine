The majority of cases are mild to moderate, but severe infections have overwhelmed healthcare systems in the United States, particularly in New York City. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of viral RNA from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs has become the standard method used to confirm diagnosis. The first quantitative RT-PCR test for detecting SARS-CoV2 was designed and distributed in January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (1) . In the United States and many other countries, however, the slow rollout of large-scale diagnostic testing and the long turnaround times associated with laboratory tests, particularly those sent to reference laboratories, have significantly hampered public health efforts to contain the outbreak.",

In contrast, the ID Now assay reliably detected specimens with Ct values \u226430, but did not detect the majority of specimens with Ct values \u2265 30. Whereas Rhoades et al. (3) found an overall high level of agreement between ID Now and the modified CDC assay, Hogan et al .(5) demonstrated lower agreement between ID Now and Panther Fusion (Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, MA). Our findings further highlight an important limitation of the ID Now for low-level positives. While all studies evaluated nasopharyngeal swabs eluted in transport media, it is important to note that the EUA for ID NOW was recently updated to remove the indication for swabs in transport media (6). Our data support that the EUA was appropriately modified, as samples may become too dilute in VTM and low-level positives may falsely test negative.",

Both assays are available for use in POC settings, which introduces both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, POC molecular testing delivers the shortest possible interval between sample collection and result, which can facilitate faster clinical J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f decision-making. However, concerns related to assay performance, quality management, and safety in the POC setting still remain. Studies of POC molecular testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus have shown promising results, but also highlight some of these concerns (7) (8) (9) (10) .

Another limitation is the use of the cobas assay as the comparator assay.
