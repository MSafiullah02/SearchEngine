Viral titers were determined at 96 hpi either in lungs, as an indicator of inhibition of local replication, or in spleen and brain, indicative of the systemic spread that is characteristic of H5N1 infection. The nAbs mediated a significant suppression of viral replication in lungs when given within 48 hours of challenge. Notably, two of the nAbs, D8 and F10, also showed significant antiviral effect when given at 72 hpi. The impact of nAb therapy on systemic spread was demonstrated by \u2265 1000-fold suppression of virus spread to the spleen even when the three nAbs were given within 72 hpi. Systemic virus spread to the brain was low in control animals, obscuring statistically significant effect of nAb treatment, but still showing a general pattern of suppression.

The reorganization to form the fusogenic state creates two major features that block access to the epitope observed in the neutral pH structure. First, one face of the \u03b1A helix involved in nAb binding becomes buried in the hydrophobic core of the new trimeric helical bundle (comprising residues 37 2 -105 2 in H3). A second face of the helix is not obscured by the triple helix; instead it becomes inaccessible by virtue of the packing of a long C-terminal arm (\"C-arm\") of HA2, the last 23 residues of which form an extended conformation that packs tightly (and anti-parallel) against 2 helices, from residue 76 2 to 38 2 . Thus, considering the F10 epitope residues in \u03b1A, Lys 38 is partlyexposed at the base of the new trimeric helix, but makes H-bonds to the C-arm. Thr41 becomes fully buried within the helical trimer, and stabilizes the N-cap of its own helix via its hydroxyl side-chain, while its methyl side-chain combines with its symmetry mates to make the first annulus of the new hydrophobic core. Gln42 remains on the outer surface of trimer, but its side-chain makes H-bonds to two main-chain elements of the C-arm (171 C=O and 173 N), so it is fully obscured. It also stabilizes the conformation of Asp46 (H-bond) which salt-bridges to Arg170 from the C-arm. Ile45 becomes fully buried in the new trimeric core, and together with the preceding Ala44 forms a 6-membered hydrophobic annulus above the Thr41 annulus. Thr49 is exposed on the trimer surface, but makes an H-bond to 169 C=O and a hydrophobic contact with Leu168 (in H3, residues 49 is Asn, which is complemented by a change at position 168, also to Asn, with which it makes a bifurcated H-bond). In the Group 1 viruses, this is the only position with a significant change -Thr49Gln in H12. Simple modeling suggests that there is sufficient space for its side-chains to form H-bonds with 168 and 169 main-chain carbonyls, and also to complement a change at position 47 (Gly47Asn). Val52 becomes completely buried, and forms the next 3-membered annulus of the hydrophobic core. Asn53 remains exposed on the helical surface, but its sidechain makes H-bonds to both the amide and C=O of residue 168. Finally, Ile56 becomes partly buried, contributing to the next hydrophobic (6-member) annulus with Ile55, and also packing tightly against the C-arm. ",

Data in this paper indicates that the humoral immune response against influenza virus is characterized by a highly restricted B-cell receptor repertoire in nature, and that more than half of the HA-specific human antibodies identified from antibody secreting cells (ASC) of influenza-vaccinated humans are raised against the globular head of HA (HA1) (This latter conclusion was not explicitly stated by the authors, but can be deduced from the data). Their data show that half of the HA-specific Abs are HI (hemagglutination inhibition) positive. Since some portion of HI-negative Abs are also HA1 specific, we can conclude that more than half of the HA-specific Abs are against HA1. The HA1 globular head is well-exposed and could be readily recognized by B cell receptors, and immune responses to this region are dominant in the vaccination procedure or by natural infection. Yet most if not all antibodies induced by this region lack cross-neutralizing-activity, owing to the great variability of HA1. Meanwhile, for conserved epitopes like the F10 epitope identified in our study, there may be a paucity of opportunities for B-cells to engage the epitope, and thus the host fails to mount a timely and productive neutralizing antibody response; or the Ab response against the F10-like epitope may be precluded due to other unknown mechanism(s).",

This construct contains a C-terminal trimerizing 'foldon' sequence from the bacteriophage T4 fibritin to stabilize the trimeric structure, followed by a thrombin site and a His 6 tag. The cDNA of the fusion protein was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector, pAcGP67A (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), to allow for efficient secretion of recombinant protein. To obtain fully cleaved HA (as HA1-HA2 trimers), sf9 cells were co-infected with baculovirus stocks of HA0 and furin at an empirically derived ratio. The furin cDNA was a gift from Dr. Robert Fuller (University of Michigan). Three days after infection, the cells were spun down and the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The beads were washed with TBS buffer (10 mM Tris.HCl, 80 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) with 10 mM imidazole, and eluted with TBS with 250 mM Imidazole. The eluted H5 protein was dialyzed against TBS buffer and further purified by ion-exchange using Mono Q HR10/10 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The purified H5 was digested by thrombin overnight and further purified by Superdex 200 column in TBS buffer.",

The RMS differences between our refined H5 trimers in the F10 complex and the H5 starting model (2IBX) are 1.0 and 0.63 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1s. The value for the second trimer is close to that expected on the basis of random error alone; the larger value for the first arises from a twist of the stem region with respect to the head by a few degrees about a vertical axis. When the two copies of the complex are superposed, the head regions overlay closely, but the stems diverge as a function of distance both from the head and from the 3-fold axis, such that the outer parts of the stem at the Ab interface shift by ~3 \u00c5. However, this does not affect the antibody-antigen contacts, and 3-fold symmetry is maintained. These differences explain why 6fold or 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (ncs) refinement was unsuccessful, although, in retrospect, we could have used 2x3-fold ncs with distinct masks for the two trimers. However, refinement without ncs converged successfully, utilizing the high resolution starting models fitted locally to the refined models after each round of automatic refinement as guides during model-building.",

H5-specific antibody 2A and 80R are negative control. Lack of binding to a Group 2 HA, H7, is also shown. Complete viral strain designations are: H7-FP34 (A/FPV/Rostock/34 (H7N1)), H13-MD77 (A/gull/MD/704/77 (H13N6)) and H16-DE06 (A/shorebird/DE/172/06 (H16N3)); and see Fig. 6 (main text) for others. Supplementary Fig. 8 Fig. S8. Anti-H5 nAbs do not neutralize H7N7 influenza virus. 10 H5selected scFv-Fc Abs were tested for neutralizing activity against H7-NL03 (A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7)) virus in a plaque reduction assay. These results are representative of two independent experiments. Supplementary Fig. 9 Fig. S9. Binding of F10 or C179 to H5 and cross-competition ELISA for F10 and C179. 0.2 \u03bcg of H5 HA proteins were coated onto 96-well ELISA plates for these experiments. Top panel: binding of F10 or C179 to H5 was tested with 2fold serial dilutions of antibody. Middle and bottom panels: F10 and C179 crosscompetition ELISAs. 0.1 \u03bcg mL -1 C179 or F10 were mixed with different concentrations of F10 or C179. Supplementary Table 1.

The gene was codon-optimized for eukaryotic cell expression and expressed as fusion protein with a C-terminal 9 amino-acids tag (C9-tag: GTETSQVAPA). The fusion protein HA1-C9 was expressed in 293T cells transiently and the secreted proteins in supernatant were harvested 48 hours after transfection and purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using Protein A Sepharose that was coupled covalently with anti-C9 antibody 1D4 (National Cell Culture Center).Expression and preparation of phage-scFvs, soluble scFv-Fcs and fulllength human IgG1. Phage-scFvs of individual clones were produced as described previously 7 . scFv-Fcs and whole human IgG1 were produced as described previously [7] [8] [9] . In brief, selected scFvs were converted to scFv-Fcs by subcloning the scFv into an Fc expression vector pcDNA 3.1-Hinge, which",
