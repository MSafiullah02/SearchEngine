In addition, primary influenza infection may lead to pneumonia (Treanor, 2000, Murphy and Webster, 1996). Host defense against influenza virus is accomplished by an interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses. Adaptive immunity against respiratory tract infection with influenza virus is mediated through antigen presentation by macrophages and dendritic cells (Braciale et al., 1987). Virus-infected cells are able to produce several cytokines and chemokines that facilitate the adaptive immune response against influenza virus (Julkunen et al., 2001).",

            "text": "IL-12, is a heterodimeric cytokine, which consists of a p35 subunit and a p40 subunit (IL-12 p70). The expression of both subunits is independently regulated, whereby the p40 subunit is expressed in excess to the p35 subunit (Gubler et al., 1991). Therefore, most of the p40 subunit is present as monomer or homodimer (D\u2019Andrea et al., 1992, Ling et al., 1995). The p40 subunit can also dimerize with a p19 subunit to form IL-23 (Oppmann et al., 2000). IL-12 has been shown to induce proliferation and differentiation of T cells towards interferon (IFN-\u03b3) producing T helper (Th) 1 cells. IL-12 is also able to induce interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production in natural killer (NK) cells. Like IL-12, IL-23 has been shown to induce proliferation of naive T cells and the production of IFN-\u03b3 (Trinchieri, 2003). IFN-\u03b3 is considered to be the most important antiviral mediator during influenza infection and induces several antiviral mechanisms, including inhibition of viral replication in virus-infected cells (Katze et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Although T-cell mediated immune responses have been shown to be important in protective immunity against influenza virus (Doherty et al., 1997), the role of IL-12 herein is less clear. Administration of recombinant IL-12 to influenza virus-infected mice has been reported to enhance (Tsurita et al., 2001) or to delay (Kostense et al., 1998) the clearance of influenza A. In many viral infections, including influenza, the endogenous production of IL-12 seems limited (Sareneva et al., 1998, Monteiro et al., 1998, Biron, 1999, Kurokawa et al., 2002, Pirhonen et al., 2002), and treatment with an anti-IL-12 antibody only modestly and transiently impairs the clearance of influenza virus from the lungs of mice (Monteiro et al., 1998). Of note, in this sole study in which the role of endogenous IL-12 in host defense against influenza A was investigated an antibody raised against the p40 subunit was used to inhibit IL-12p70 activity (Monteiro et al., 1998). In that investigation the extent of IL-12 neutralization was not evaluated. Moreover, since the p40 component of IL-12p70 is also part of IL-23, it is likely that this antibody also influenced the activity of endogenous IL-23 (Lankford and Frucht, 2003). In the present study we sought to determine the role of endogenous IL-12 in the host response to influenza A virus by using p35 gene deficient mice, animals in which IL-12 is the only cytokine that cannot be produced.",

Host defense against viral infections are predominantly mediated by Th1 immune responses (Julkunen et al., 2001, Doherty et al., 1997). Antigen-presentation by dendritic cells leads to the activation of naive T cells to proliferate and differentiate into T helper cells (Hamilton-Easton and Eichelberger, 1995). Cytokines play a decisive role in the formation of either Th1 or Th2 responses. IL-12 has been implicated in the formation of Th1 lymphocytes and may play an important role in host defense against viral infections (Julkunen et al., 2001, Trinchieri, 2003). In the present study we investigated the role of IL-12 during influenza virus infection by using IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice, in which the production of IL-12 is selectively eliminated. Our data demonstrate that IL-12 does not markedly contribute to innate and adaptive immunity against influenza A. If anything, IL-12 deficiency was associated with lower rather than higher viral loads at 8 days after infection. Of note, we determined viral load by real-time quantitative PCR instead of a standard plaque assay. The major differences between these two methods is that a standard plaque assay only detects viable (live) virus, i.e. virus that has been shed by infected cells, whereas molecular techniques detect all viral particles, including remnant viral genomes in dead cells.",

Previous studies support our findings of marginal IL-12 production during influenza. Indeed, influenza-infected macrophages did not produce significant amounts of IL-12 (Sareneva et al., 1998, Pirhonen et al., 2002) and influenza infection in mice resulted in IL-12 concentrations in lungs that were barely higher than in lungs of control mice (Monteiro et al., 1998, Kurokawa et al., 2002). Our data expand the results of a previous study in which administration with an anti-p40 antibody (in theory inhibiting both IL-12 and IL-23 activity) modestly reduced local IFN-\u03b3 release during airway infection with influenza A (Monteiro et al., 1998). The fact that very low concentrations of IL-12 p70 can contribute to IFN-\u03b3 production has also been demonstrated in other experimental conditions such as whole blood cultures stimulated with endotoxin or bacteria (Lauw et al., 1999, Lauw et al., 2002).",

However, the evidence for this assumption is not readily available in the literature. To the best of our knowledge only one study directly evaluated the role of endogenous IL-12 in host defense against influenza. In this investigation, Monteiro et al. (1998) used an antibody directed against the p40 subunit to inhibit IL-12 activity in influenza infected mice; the authors did not report to what extent IL-12 activity was inhibited by the antibody. In addition, it is quite likely that the antibody also interfered with the activity of IL-23, a novel cytokine that shares the p40 subunit with IL-12 p70 and further consists of a p19 subunit (Oppmann et al., 2000); this cytokine had yet to be discovered at the time Monteiro et al. published their study. Importantly, IL-23 can also direct Th1 responses and has been claimed to be more important in cellular immunity than IL-12 (Ha et al., 2004). Anti-p40 treatment was associated with modestly elevated influenza titers in lungs at 3 days after infection when compared with mice treated with rat immunogobulin, whereas viral loads were similar in both experimental groups at days 5 and 7 after infection (Monteiro et al., 1998). Our current finding that IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice had lower rather than higher influenza titers at day 8 after infection strongly argues against a dominant role for IL-12 in the protective immune response against this common virus. This notion is supported by an earlier study showing that administration of recombinant IL-12 to influenza virus-infected mice delayed the clearance of influenza A (Kostense et al., 1998), although this was not confirmed in another investigation (Tsurita et al., 2001). Nonetheless, our data together with the results obtained by Monteiro et al. (1998) indicate that further research is required to identify the role of IL-23 during influenza A infection.",

Although IL-12 and IL-18 are not structurally related, both cytokines are known to induce a Th1 response. The enhanced viral clearance in IL-18\u2212/\u2212 mice correlated with enhanced CD69 expression CD4+ T cells. In contrast, wildtype mice and IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a similar expression of CD69 and influenza-specific T cell receptors on the surface of recruited lymphocytes when compared with wildtype mice. These data suggest that the cellular immune response to influenza virus is not significantly altered in IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice. The humoral immune response appeared to be slightly altered in IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice. The IgM response appeared to be lower in IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212, which may have been caused by a lower viral load in the lungs of these mice. However, a tendency towards increased IgG2b formation in IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 was observed as well, which might indicate an early class-switch from IgM to IgG. The net effect of reduced IgM and increased IgG2b titers on day 12 after infection seems to be of minor importance since both IgM and IgG have been shown to be capable of neutralizing influenza virus (Kopf et al., 2002, Renegar et al., 2004). This suggestion is in line with our findings that wildtype mice and IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice show similar viral loads on day 12 after infection.",

            "text": "Cell counts in BALF indicate that the recruitment of neutrophils and to a lesser extent macrophages was reduced in IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice. These reduced cell numbers on day 8 after infection could be the consequence of IL-12 deficiency, since IL-12 has been implicated in recruitment of macrophages (Ha et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2001, Kawakami et al., 1996, Pearlman et al., 1997) and neutrophils (Papp et al., 2000), via induction of other inflammatory mediators. Alternatively, diminished cell numbers in IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice could have been caused by reduced viral load, providing a less potent proinflammatory stimulus. Homodimeric p40 can function as a chemotactic factor for macrophages (Heinzel et al., 1997, Ha et al., 1999), which has been shown to play an important role during respiratory tract infection with Sendai virus in mice (Russell et al., 2003). Here we found elevated p40 concentrations in lungs of IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice on days 8 and 12 after infection. Although we did not measure the amount of monomeric and homodimeric p40, previous studies indicate that excess amounts of p40 consist for up to one-third of homodimeric p40\u2013p40. The excess amount of p40 produced in IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice may be, in part, present in a homodimeric form. Our study indicates a reduced number of macrophages in BAL fluid of IL-12 p35\u2212/\u2212 mice (135 \u00b1 29 versus 220 \u00b1 25 in wildtype mice) on day 8 after infection, which contradicts a possible chemotactic role of homodimeric IL-12 p40. An alternative explanation would be that the excess of IL-12 p40 forms heterodimeric IL-23. This latter explanation would be in line with the hypothesis that IL-23 plays a more prominent role than IL-12 in host defense against influenza virus infection. Additional research is warranted to determine the contribution of homodimeric p40 and/or IL-23 in host defense against influenza A.",
