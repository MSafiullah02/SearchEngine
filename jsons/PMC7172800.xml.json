These sharp edges traumatize the oral cavity, leading to gingivitis, stomatitis, and glossitis. The common presentation of dental disease is lethargy, anorexia, and hypersalivation.2 Radiographic studies have proved to be a valuable tool to completely evaluate malocclusion.3 The cause(s) may be familial or the result of trauma or inappropriate dietary items or infections.",

The septicemic form affects the viscera with or without meningoencephalitis and is common in monogastric animals, whereas encephalitis and abortion occur principally in adult ruminants. Historically, chinchillas are considered one of the species more susceptible to visceral listeriosis, especially when reared in confinement. The lesions include emaciation, multiple white foci on the capsular/serosal surfaces and parenchyma of the liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, and intestines, including the cecum and colon. Rectal prolapses and colonic intussusception also occurred (Fig. 1\n).9 These lesions grossly resemble infections by Salmonella sp as well as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Histologically, the intestines have transmural inflammation effacing the Peyer patches of the small intestine and multifocal inflammation of cecum and colon.6 The source of infection is usually from foodstuffs.9\nListeria ivanovii, a more common isolate from cattle and sheep, has also been identified in chinchillas, resulting in septicemia. The intestines were noted to have mucoid contents.10\n",
