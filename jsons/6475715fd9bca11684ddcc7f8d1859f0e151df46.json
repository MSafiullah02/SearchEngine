Although a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is an intriguing possibility, there has been no evidence which indicates its existence so far. Given the situation, it is natural to keep an open mind on the identity of DM and search various other possibilities. A spin-one dark photon, which arises from an abelian gauge group outside of the Standard Model, gives one of the most popular alternatives to a WIMP DM in that dark photons are ubiquitous in physics beyond the Standard Model as well as string theory. A light dark photon DM does not require any symmetry to ensure its stability unlike the case of a WIMP DM whose mass is around the electroweak scale. Dark photons kinetically mixing with the ordinary photon have been actively searched over a wide range of their masses (for a review of ongoing and future experiments, see ref. [1] ).",

Inflationary fluctuations can also produce the longitudinal mode of a dark photon DM through the mass term [4] . The correct relic abundance is realized when the dark photon has a mass m \u03b3 > \u223c \u00b5eV. A light dark photon whose mass is below \u00b5eV needs another mechanism. Recently, this issue has been discussed by several authors [5] [6] [7] . Their mechanisms, relying on a dark photon coupling to an axion-like field or a scalar field charged under a dark U (1), can realize a dark photon DM with a wide range of masses extending down to 10 \u221220 eV, which reaches the fuzzy DM paradigm [8, 9] . The dark photon DM is produced with the assistance of another light scalar field coupling to the dark photon. Ref. [10] has discussed the production of a light dark photon DM from a network of cosmic strings. Such cosmic strings arise from the same physics that makes the dark photon massive.",

            "text": "In this paper, we pursue the possibility of a light dark photon DM without the assistance of any additional field other than the inflaton, which is by itself an essential ingredient for the standard cosmology. Our dark photon field directly couples to the inflaton. The authors of ref. [11] initiated such a possibility by introducing a coupling \u03d5F F where \u03d5 is the inflaton field and F , F are the field strength of the dark photon field A and its dual. The dark photon DM is generated via tachyonic instability during inflation. However, since this coupling is proportional to the wavenumber, the dark photon field with a large wavelength is not efficiently produced and the correct DM abundance could be achieved with a dark photon mass m \u03b3 > \u223c \u00b5eV, which is not our target. Instead, we consider a coupling of the dark photon field to the inflaton I 2 (\u03d5)F F where I is some function of \u03d5. The motion of \u03d5 through this coupling breaks conformal invariance in the 4-D free Maxwell theory so that the classical dark photon field is produced upon the horizon exit of quantum fluctuations during inflation. 1 This class of coupling has been actively studied in the context of primordial large-scale magnetogenesis [12] , though its difficulty has also been evidenced [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (see also [22, 23] ). 2 Instead, we here show that the dark photon field with a large wavelength is efficiently produced with this coupling and becomes non-relativistic before the time of matter-radiation equality. The correct relic abundance is realized with a dark photon mass extending down to 10 \u221221 eV.",

Section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions. In Appendix A, we discuss the contribution of the longitudinal mode and demonstrate that it is subdominant to the transverse modes. 1 Note that a free Maxwell field does not \"feel\" the horizon by itself due to the conformal invariance, and the presence of the coupling is essential. This fact is in sharp contrast to other matter contents whose free fields can be produced by coupling to gravity alone. 2 The large-wavelength modes produced in the mechanism of this type can also source background and statistical anisotropies [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

We considered a coupling of the dark photon field to the inflaton \u03d5 in the form I 2 (\u03d5)F F , where I is some function of \u03d5. The classical dark photon field is produced due to the motion of \u03d5, through which the former experiences the \"horizon exit\" of quantum fluctuations during inflation.",

Its spectrum is peaked around the wavenumber that exits the horizon at the earliest time and subsequently grows exponentially due to the expansion during inflation. Since the produced dark photon carries small momentum, this mechanism circumvents the requirement for a dark photon to be non-relativistic in the early time and allows a parameter domain with a sub-\u00b5eV DM mass. For a successful scenario with the correct dark photon DM abundance, a few consistency conditions are imposed: (i) the backreaction of the produced dark photon onto the background inflationary dynamics needs to be negligible, (ii) the dark photon mass should be much smaller than the inflationary Hubble parameter to avoid mass suppression, and (iii) the dark photon necessarily becomes non-relativistic before the matter-radiation equality.",

Yet, with all these constraints respected, we have shown that the correct relic abundance is realized with a dark photon mass extending down to 10 \u221221 eV. This is in the realm of fuzzy dark matter, and the mass range of dark matter below this value is excluded by the Lyman-\u03b1 forest observations and the superradiance constraints from a supermassive black hole. 7 As can be seen in Figure 1 , the time dependence of the function I should be close to \u223c a \u22122 , which implies that the dark photon spectrum is close to scale invariant. Although we have assumed a simple relation between I and a to perform analytical calculation, this conclusion itself is expected to hold more generally.",

Our result shows that the open parameter space is relatively narrow, as only the region \u22122.15 n < \u22122 is allowed from Figure 1 , which is consistent to the qualitative claim of [37] . Yet we have quantitatively shown that there exists an open parameter space in which our scenario is viable. The reason is related to the fact that our dark photon is originated from vacuum fluctuations and the perturbative treatment is always ensured, see footnote 3. Another side note is that the mass range of dark photon they consider is much heavier than that of our interest.",
