Here, we focus on the first reported GO-based enzyme activity assay, namely the GO-based helicase activity assay (GOHA), and its use in identifying helicase nsP13 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV, SCV) (Jang et al., 2010) . SARS is a viral respiratory disease in humans characterized by flu-like symptoms and high mortality rates. SCV helicases have been recognized as a primary target for direct-acting antiviral agents against SARS (Huang et al., 2008) . The GOHA platform relies on the preferential binding of GO to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) over double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the quenching of DNA-conjugated fluorescent dyes when the GO and dyes are present in close proximity. Strong adsorption of single-stranded nucleotides to GO is mediated by pi-pi stacking interactions between the aromatic rings in the exposed bases that constitute single-stranded nucleotides and the sp2 hybridized hexagonal structure of GO (Liu et al., 2008; Varghese et al., 2009 ). Contrary to ssDNA, dsDNA cannot interact with GO because the bases of dsDNA are located inside the double helix within the negatively charged phosphate backbone (He et al., 2010) . Unwinding of dsDNA is initiated by addition of SCV helicases to a mixture of fluorescence-labeled substrate dsDNA and GO. As the helicase reaction proceeds, the fluorescence intensity decreases due to the energy transfer-mediated quenching that occurs upon binding", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 109, "text": "(Lee and Min, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 131, "end": 149, "text": "(Lee et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 165, "end": 185, "text": "(Wang et al., 2011b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 422, "end": 441, "text": "(Jang et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 654, "end": 674, "text": "(Huang et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1163, "text": "(Liu et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1185, "text": "Varghese et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1367, "text": "(He et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GO-BASED HELICASE BIOSENSOR"}, {"text": "http://molcells.org Established in 1990 Minireview of unwound ssDNA to the GO surface ( Fig. 1 ).

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) leads to severe liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma (Choo et al., 1989; Francesco et al., 2005) . At present, a combination of PEG-conjugated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin is routinely prescribed for treating hepatitis C infection. Interferon-\u03b1 is an immune booster and ribavirin is a nucleosidemimicking derivative that causes lethal mutations in the virus during RNA replication and indirectly contributes to sustaining the immune response against HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3. However, this pharmacological intervention has showed only limited efficacy with significant side effects, including hemolytic anemia, depression, and fatigue. Frequent genetic mutations in HCV and drug resistance also significantly limit the effectiveness of current hepatitis treatments. For higher therapeutic efficacy, new drugs have been anticipated to target more genetically conserved proteins of HCV such as proteases. Directacting antiviral agents targeting the non-structural protein 3-4A serine protease (NS3-4A) and non-structural protein 5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B RdRp) (Farnik and Zeuzem, 2012) in the viral replication cycle have been reported to be more effective than conventional therapy.

After the primary and secondary screens, five inhibitors specific to each helicase and five inhibitors active towards both helicases were identified. The inhibitors exhibited 50-500 \u03bcM of IC 50 values on target helicases. Furthermore, most directly inhibited the ATPase activity of the target helicase. Among the five compounds identified as HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors, two compounds showed a considerable inhibitory effect on HCV gene replication following infection of the human liver cell line Huh-7.
