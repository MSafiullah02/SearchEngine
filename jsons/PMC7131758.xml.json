Atypical radiologic manifestations of TB, encountered in as many as one third of cases include such lower infiltrates. And lower lobe predominance is seen even more commonly in nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. In advanced SARS cases, perihilar enlargement, was noted, a hallmark of TB. In addition, the majority of the lesions contained an area of ground-glass opacification with or without consolidation. Ground-glass findings are a predominant finding in high resolution CT (HRCT) of miliary tuberculosis and of 25 TB patients, Hong observed 23 with areas of ground-glass opacities, a sign of active infection (6).",

This lack of rigidity allows them the plasticity to assume many forms (pleomorphic), some of which are viral-like but all different from their classical parent and poorly confirmed by ordinary staining (18). Of all the bacteria, L-forms predominate and are crucial to the survival of the mycobacteria, whose cell-wall deficient (CWD) forms escape destruction by the body\u2019s immune system. At the same time many of these mycobacterial L-forms, are variably acid-fast, meaning that depending upon what stage they are in they only intermittently pick up acid-fast stain, classically used to detect TB.",
