The overall survival for pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest remains low at less than 40% [3, 4]. Although severe hypoxia and respiratory failure remain the most common cause of pediatric in hospital cardiac arrests, 10\u201315% have rhythm that requires defibrillation [5]. The outcome of cardiac arrest is dependent on critical interventions, especially early defibrillation, effective chest compressions and assisted ventilation [6, 7]. Invasive blood pressure and cardiac output monitoring provide an accurate means of assessing the effectiveness of chest compressions [8]. However, invasive monitoring at the time of either the arrest or initiation of resuscitation occurs in less than 50% of in-hospital pediatrics cardiac arrest cases and almost never occurs in out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest cases [2]. The need for accurate, non-invasive, and real-time monitoring of both oxygenation and circulation during resuscitation is, therefore, paramount to the improvement of resuscitation outcomes.",

Furthermore, EtCO2 has been suggested to correlate with cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, and it has also been reported to be a predictor of survival and prognosis in patients after cardiac arrest and resuscitation [10, 11]. However, measurement of EtCO2 can be particularly unreliable in low-flow states such as during CPR or in the presence of significant pulmonary pathology. Moreover, the accuracy of EtCO2 measurement depends on proper capnography waveforms that may be difficult to obtain during chest compressions [12, 13]. Finally, EtCO2 does not provide any meaningful information about the quality of organ perfusion and oxygenation during resuscitation [14].",

            "text": "Regional oxygen saturation monitoring with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a noninvasive surrogate monitor of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) [15, 16]. During critical illness, NIRS probes are routinely placed on the forehead to measure cerebral rSO2 (C-rSO2) and the back to measure renal rSO2 (R-rSO2), referred to as two-site rSO2. Two-site rSO2 can provide a real-time indicator of the balance between oxygen supply and demand in the intraoperative and intensive care setting. Moreover, two-site rSO2 represent two opposite poles of circulation, and the compensatory response to low cardiac output can be reflected in a decrease in R-rSO2 while C-rSO2 is preserved. This clinical information can help the provider to make treatment decisions and assess the effect of therapeutic interventions in settings of low cardiac output, such as cardiogenic, hemorrhagic and septic shock [17]. Moreover, NIRS does not require pulsatile flow, which makes it an ideal monitoring tool during cardiac arrest [18]. Although NIRS technology has been validated and used in many clinical scenarios, limited studies have examined the role of two-site rSO2 monitoring during cardiac arrest to assess the effectiveness of chest compressions and detection of ROSC without interrupting resuscitation efforts [19\u201322].",

Animals had free access to water but were fasted overnight. Each animal was pre-medicated with intramuscular telazol (4\u20137 mg/kg) and xylazine (2 mg/kg). Subsequently, a 20 g intravenous catheter was placed into an ear vein for additional anaesthetic agents (Propofol, 2\u201310 mg/kg) prior to the procedure. The animal was intubated with cuffed endotracheal tube and mechanically ventilated under general anaesthesia using mixture of room air and titrated isoflurane (0.5\u20131.5% inspired concentration). Volumetric capnography monitor (Philips, Carlsbad, CA) was connected to the ventilator circuit via a side stream capnostat sensor placed at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube (between the endotracheal tube and the ventilator circuit). Then animals were deeply sedated with adequate pain control throughout the experiment using fentanyl (3.0\u201310.0 \u03bcg/kg/h IV) as needed. The tidal volume was initially set at 8\u201310 mL/kg and the ventilator rate at 12 breaths per minute; ventilator settings then were adjusted to maintain PaCO2 at 35 to 45 mm Hg. The femoral artery was accessed by percutaneous methods then a 6 Fr sheath was placed and advanced to the abdominal aorta to measure systemic pressure and to withdraw blood for blood gas analysis. A 6 Fr sheath was also placed in the femoral vein by percutaneous methods for further administration of medications. A median sternotomy was performed and the heart was exposed. Finally, an ultrasonic flow probe (PAU Series, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) was placed around the pulmonary artery.",

The AUCs for sudden increase in EtCO2, C-rSO2, and R-rSO2 at ROSC were 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77\u20130.94], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.8\u20130.94], and 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96\u20131.00] respectively (Fig. 3). The optimal threshold for percentage change cutoffs for EtCO2, C-rSO2, and R-rSO2 were 9.3%, 4.0%, and 5.0% respectively. At these cutoffs, a sudden increase in EtCO2, C-rSO2, and R-rSO2 had similar sensitivities (96%, 92%, and 96%). However, R-rSO2 was the most specific when compared to EtCO2 and C-rSO2 (91% vs. 73% and 72%). Further analysis included only the first VF arrest for each animal showed that AUCs for sudden increase in EtCO2, C-rSO2, and R-rSO2 at ROSC were 0.86 [95% CI 0.82\u20130.90], 0.72 [95% CI 0.66\u20130.78], and 0.84 [95% CI 0.79\u20130.89] respectively (Fig. 3). The optimal threshold for percentage change cutoffs for EtCO2, C-rSO2, and R-rSO2 were 6.8%, 9.9%, and 7.5% respectively. At these cutoffs, a sudden increase in EtCO2 was more sensitive than C-rSO2 and R-rSO2 (93% vs. 50% and 82%). However, C-rSO2 and R-rSO2 were more specific when compared to EtCO2 (93% and 82% vs. 76%) (Fig. 4).",

We report the potential use of two-site rSO2, and EtCO2 to monitor the effectiveness and quality of CPR, and ROSC.

As EtCO2 reflects PBF, and two-site rSO2 reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and extraction at 2 two different vascular beds [28], the use of both monitoring devices during resuscitation may provide complementary information on the quality of resuscitation organ perfusion, and tissue oxygenation during CPR. Our result is consistent with the findings of Koyama et al. who reported that C-rSO2 could reliably assess the quality of chest compressions and improve effectiveness of CPR in adult cardiac arrest patients. However, in that study only C-rSO2 waveform (not the absolute value) was used to assess the quality of chest compression [26]. In our study the quality of chest compressions was controlled and continuously monitored and the absolute rSO2 was monitored as well. In contrast to our results, K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen et al. found that C-rSO2 remained low during high-quality resuscitation and that improvement in CPR was not significantly reflected in C-rSO2 [27]. However, the assessment of C-rSO2 was not monitored prior to initiation of CPR and therefore the C-rSO2 before cardiac arrest was not known. Moreover, quality of CPR provided was monitored using defibrillator with CPR quality analysis features and no other direct or invasive measurements of CPR quality was measured. In regard to EtCO2, a recent study using a lamb asphyxial cardiac arrest model, Chandrasekharan et al. demonstrated a relationship between EtCO2 and adequate chest compression during resuscitation, and concluded that a rapid increase in EtCO2 with a threshold of > 32 mmHg is 100 sensitive and 97% specific in predicting ROSC [29]. Moreover, a recent multicenter study of 583 adult patients with in- and out hospital CA showed that depth of chest compression was associated with higher EtCO2 which suggest that EtCO2 monitoring during CPR might be a useful tool to guide effective resuscitation after CA [30].",

Although C-rSO2, R-rSO2, and EtCO2 were all very sensitive tests to detect ROSC, R-rSO2 was more specific than both C-rSO2 and EtCO2. Thus adding renal NIRS monitoring during resuscitation might not only guide resuscitation, but can be used to detect with more confidence ROSC. Our results is consistent with Pokorna et al. who showed that a sudden increase in EtCO2 > 10 mmHg during out-of-hospital CPR could be used as an early indicator of ROSC [31]. Similarly, with the findings of Singer et al. who reported that during outside hospital CA, both mean C-rSO2 and EtCO2 during CPR can be used to predict ROSC [32]. They found that EtCO2 was more sensitive and C-rSO2 was more specific at predicting ROSC. However, they didn\u2019t assess the sensitivity and specificity of sudden increase in both to detect ROSC. Moreover, a growing number of recent studies demonstrated that a higher mean cerebral rSO2 during CPR was observed in patients who achieved ROSC compared to non-survivors [14, 20, 32, 33].

We acknowledge that our model might not resemble the clinical situation of most critically ill patients who suffer cardiac arrest and require CPR, however, it might be clinically relevant in anaesthetized patients or patients who just undergone cardiac surgery and suffer a sudden, cardiac deterioration and arrest. Second, the cardiac massage was performed by hand and mean PBF goal was used during resuscitation. Also animals received normal saline and/or sodium bicarbonate after ROSC which might led to a transient increase in EtCO2 without an actual increase in cardiac output during subsequent arrests, however, further analysis of the first VF arrest didn\u2019t indicate such effect, in the contrary, EtCO2 was more sensitive than C-rSO2 and R-rSO2 to detect ROSC during the first VF arrests when compared to subsequent arrests (Fig. 4). Third, all animals had relatively healthy lungs, which may not reflect common pediatric cardiac arrests. This latter point presents a concern as EtCO2 is affected by alveolar dead space, which may be a confounding factor when assessing changes in CO. Finally, analgosedative drugs were administered, as necessary, to maintain adequate analgesia and anesthesia. The use of these drugs may have affected cardiovascular function and autonomic control during resuscitation.",
