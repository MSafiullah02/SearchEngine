Barley and its extracts are rich in 30 ingredients to combat more than 20 chronic diseases, which include the 14 similar and 9 different chronic diseases between grains and grass, due to the major molecular mechanism of six functional ingredients of barley grass (GABA, flavonoids, SOD, K-Ca, vitamins, and tryptophan) and grains (\u03b2-glucans, polyphenols, arabinoxylan, phytosterols, tocols, and resistant starch). The antioxidant activity of barley grass and grain has the same and different functional components. These results support findings that barley grain and its grass are the best functional food, promoting ancient Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations, and further show the depending functional ingredients for diet from Pliocene hominids in Africa and Neanderthals in Europe to modern humans in the world.

An efficacious antiproliferation capacity in Caco-2 cells of black barley malt free extract was predicted due to its phenolic constituents which have cellular antioxidant and oxygen radical absorbance as well as peroxyl radical scavenging activities, DPPH, and ABTS radical scavenging assays [152] . Black barley sprouting stimulates the phenolic biosynthesis by upregulating proline-associated pentose phosphate pathway to support structure of sprouts with antioxidant capacity [153] . Total phenolic and pentosan in hulless barley grains have antioxidant activity by downregulated expression of heat shock protein 60 and phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 but upregulated expression of enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase and peroxiredoxin 6 [118] . The total polyphenol (flavonoid) content and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and ABTS radical scavenging abilities increased as the barley added to the food mixture [154] . Lignan (-)-7(S)-hydroxymatairesinol inhibited tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 stimulated endothelial inflammation by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation and upregulating Nrf2 antioxidant element signaling pathway [155] .

Arabinoxylan in barley is the most abundant polysaccharide that has the capacity of lowering cholesterol and glucose as well as antioxidant activities [55] . The major mechanisms of barley arabinoxylan for preventing chronic diseases are as follows: arabinoxylan can improve 21 urinary metabolites associated with diabetes by improvement of carbohydrate and lipid as well as amino acid metabolism [158] . The antioxidant and antiobesity as well as immunomodulation of arabinoxylans associated with prebiotic effects and short-chain fatty acids production by interaction of gut microbiota and arabinoxylans [122] . Arabinoxylan rice bran can increase anticancer effects in the older population by increased NK activity [159] . The arabinoxylan in barley with the immunomodulatory activity consisted of a xylan backbone with acetate, arabinose, galactose, glucuronic acid, and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid [160] . The arabinoxylan diet led to a lower postprandial blood for glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide response, especially fat oxidation has an important role in the antiobesity and in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases [161] . Barley polysaccharide prevent cardiovascular diseases by the vasodilatory effect of controlling angiotensin-converting enzyme production [17] . Tables 2 and 3 ). Barley grains contain phytosterols that can esterify to fatty acids, phenolic acids, steryl glucosides, or acylated steryl glycosides [18] . Phytosterols significantly inhibited the ability of oxysterols to activate the liver X receptors transcription in modulating cancer cell behavior [62] , which are thought to influence multiple processes related to cancer, such as carcinogen production, cancercell growth, angiogenesis, invasion, metasis, and cancer-cell apoptosis [162] . For the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, barley phytosterols can compete with cholesterol for micelle formation, inhibiting cholesterol absorption in intestine and lowering cholesterol in central nervous system of the brain [18, 162] .

Antidiabetes of RS can be increased by suppressing amylopectin synthesis through silencing of starch branching enzymes in barley [165] . T cell development and gut IgA production suppress host lipid absorption by modulating CD36 expression [166] to achieve the effect of antiobesity of barley RS.

The blending of barley starch citrate with resistant starch IV up to 20% can produce noodles of acceptable quality and numerous health benefits [169] . Early hominids used fruits/vegetables and leaves rich in polyphenols and K-Ca as well as vitamins as staple foods to increase the dependence of the human body on these functional ingredients (see Figure 2 ). Diet played an important role in early hominids evolution [170] , but no reports have been delivered to date for diet in coevolution of human chronic diseases. Miocene (23.0~5.3 Ma) apes had a variety of foods that included folivory, soft-fruit eating, and hard-object feeding [170] . The diet of Pliocene (5.3~2. 5 Ma) and early Pleistocene (2.5~1. 4 Ma) hominids in Africa was mainly fruits and leaves of C3 plants (trees, bushes, shrubs; 5.3~4.1 Ma) which was gradually transformed into grass (C4 plant/tropical grasses and sedges) and hard-object (seeds and nuts) (4.0~1.4 Ma) [170] [171] [172] , which was due to low availability of fruits in dry and active glacier (1.81~1. 55 Ma) as well as migration to warm grasslands.
