            "text": "In August 2015, when we first discussed the idea of a special issue on infections and pregnancy with Drs. Vekemans and Chambers (editor-in-chief and deputy editor of Birth Defects Research Part A), our goal was to highlight infectious diseases, both established and emerging, and their effects on the pregnant woman and her fetus. At that time, Zika virus had been identified in Brazil and was rapidly spreading throughout the country (Campos et al., 2015; Zanluca et al., 2015) , but the sharp increase in births of infants with microcephaly had not yet been observed (Kleber de Oliveira et al., 2016) . Since then, evidence has accumulated to confirm Zika virus as a teratogen (Rasmussen et al., 2016a) , and much has been learned about Zika virus and its effects during pregnancy (Oussayef et al., 2017) . Although Zika virus has fueled an interest in infections during pregnancy and their potential teratogenicity, the effects of infectious diseases on the pregnant woman and her fetus have long been recognized. In fact, the first exposure recognized to be a teratogen (rubella) was an infectious one (Webster, 1998; Wesselhoeft, 1947) , and several well-recognized teratogens, including cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, and varicella zoster, among others, are infections (Obi\u010dan and Scialli, 2011) .",

Several articles aim to update the reader on established infections with adverse effects on the fetus. As reviewed by Ornoy et al.

Infection during pregnancy does not seem to have a characteristic pattern of birth defects; however, infection in pregnancy can lead to fetal loss, fetal damage, and, in rare cases, brain abnormalities and neurodevelopmental delays. Parvovirus targets the fetal liver, the main site of hematopoiesis in the fetus, and damages fetal erythrocytes, leading to severe fetal anemia, high output cardiac failure, myocarditis, and nonimmune hydrops. Although women are often immune before their childbearing years, the well-established fetal effects of parvovirus B19 infection generate significant concern among women infected during pregnancy.",

Also, improved detection methods have resulted in an increasing number of food recalls and potential exposures.

Tsimis and Sheffield (in this issue) provide a historical review of syphilis, outlining the decreasing trends that occurred over time with advent and widespread use of penicillin. However, syphilis rates have since increased as a result of changes in behavior and public health practice. The reemergence of syphilis in the past was attributed to an increase in men having sex with men, the HIV/AIDs epidemic, and increased drug-sex exchange. Most recently, in 2013 to 2014, an increased number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis was reported among young women across the country, affecting all races and ethnicities, with a concomitant rise in congenital syphilis. This resurgence of syphilis highlights that even when the pathophysiology of infections are well understood and effective prevention and treatment are available, congenital infections can reemerge. Continued vigilance is required to ensure pregnant women are appropriately diagnosed and treated.",

This article reviews challenges faced in the study of prenatal effects of these infections, including the wide range of potential adverse outcomes, differing effects depending on gestational age of maternal infection, difficulty with detecting mild or asymptomatic maternal infections, and problems with laboratory testing of a newly recognized congenital infection. This review of strategies to study the effects of emerging infections on the fetus might be useful to guide the study of the effects of future emerging infections. Gilboa et al. (in this issue) describe an important approach being used to understand the effects of congenital Zika infection. Their paradigm of combining pregnancy registry data with data collected on infants with adverse outcomes identified through birth defects surveillance systems holds great promise in enhancing the understanding of Zika, because taken together these two surveillance systems are more likely to capture the complete picture of possible fetal effects. This combined approach could also be used for other emerging infections associated with birth defects, and is particularly useful to study the consequences of infections that have substantial rates of asymptomatic maternal infection. In addition, this approach provides an opportunity to study the value of prenatal diagnostic testing (e.g., ultrasonography) and the correlation between a prenatal diagnosis of birth defects and postnatal findings.",

Examples of greater emphasis on prevention of infection in infants are the recommendations for routine maternal vaccination with inactivated influenza and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines to protect infants from influenza and pertussis. Better understanding of the maternal humoral immune response, specifically that the maternal response to vaccine was similar to that in nonpregnant adults, greater recognition of the limitations of the neonatal immune response, and more data on transplacental passage of maternal antibodies has led to greater acceptance of maternal vaccination.",

The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic influenza provided solid evidence that pregnant women are more severely affected by certain infections. The recent, rapid spread of Zika virus in the Americas has provided additional evidence that infections in pregnancy can cause birth defects. Furthermore, recent events have highlighted the need for better strategies to safely and effectively prevent and treat infections in pregnancy. For example, an effective vaccine for Zika virus is urgently needed to protect pregnant women and infants from the devastating fetal effects of Zika; longer-lasting influenza vaccines could decrease maternal morbidity and mortality. Although interest and knowledge in infectious diseases during pregnancy has increased markedly in recent years, many challenges remain to be addressed. ",
