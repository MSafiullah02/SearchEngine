Compared to other togaviruses, RV replicates very slowly suggesting that it must employ effective mechanisms to delay the innate immune response. A recent study by our laboratory revealed that the capsid protein of RV is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. A primary mechanism by which RV capsid interferes with programmed cell death appears to be through interaction with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax. In the present study, we report that the capsid protein also blocks IRF3-dependent apoptosis induced by the double-strand RNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. In addition, analyses of cis-acting elements revealed that phosphorylation and membrane association are important for its anti-apoptotic function. Finally, the observation that hypo-phosphorylated capsid binds Bax just as well as wild-type capsid protein suggests that interaction with this pro-apoptotic host protein in and of itself is not sufficient to block programmed cell death. This provides additional evidence that this viral protein inhibits apoptosis through multiple mechanisms.",

It is a human pathogen normally associated with the relatively mild, self-limiting disease Rubella, or German measles. Common complications include arthralgia, arthritis and thrombocytopenia; however, severe neurological disorders such as progressive panencephalitis may also occur. Significantly, RV can cause severe birth defects when contracted during the first trimester of pregnancy (reviewed in Hobman, 2013) . While little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of RV infection, it has been suggested that viral persistence is important. For example, long-term shedding of virus has been observed in infants with congenital rubella syndrome (Phillips et al., 1965) and in adults patients suffering from RV-associated arthritis (Chantler et al., 1982; 1985) .",

Unlike alphaviruses, which comprise the majority of togaviruses, RV is a slowly replicating virus that has an unusually long eclipse period. Infection of mammalian cells by RV has been reported to cause apoptosis (Pugachev and Frey, 1998; Hofmann et al., 1999) , but generally this does not occur until long after the peak virus production periods. We recently demonstrated that RV-infected cells are in fact resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli (Ilkow et al., 2011) , a property that would be expected to provide a window of opportunity for replication. The resistance of RV-infected cells to apoptosis is thought to be dependent wholly or in part, on the capsid protein, which binds to and inhibits the pro-apoptotic host protein Bax. In the present study we demonstrate that binding to Bax is not sufficient for the apoptotic function of capsid; however, loss of phosphorylation and membrane association leads to decreased anti-apoptotic activity. These data suggest that specific localization and or the ability to interact with additional factors are critical for its function in blocking apoptosis.",

In order to further understand how this viral protein affects mitochondrial physiology, we examined the effects of adding recombinant capsid protein to freshly isolated mitochondria. Because capsid protein blocks apoptosis in part through its interaction with Bax, we anticipated that treatment of isolated mitochondria with purified capsid protein would protect from pro-apoptotic factors such as tBid (Li et al., 1998) . Surprisingly, addition of capsid to mitochondria had a similar effect as tBid in vitro (Fig. 1A) . Specifically, mitochondria treated with recombinant RV capsid or tBid exhibited a dramatic loss of membrane potential compared to buffer alone, an event that often precedes release of cytochrome c during the early stages of apoptosis (Liu et al., 1996) . Consistent with these results, exposure of mitochondria to recombinant capsid protein resulted in efflux of cytochrome c (Fig. 1B) . Addition of a control protein, Sec17, did not induce release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Similar to RV capsid protein Sec17 is a peripheral membrane protein with a molecular mass of 34 kDa (Griff et al., 1992) . The effect of RV capsid on cytochrome c efflux was not linear but rather appeared to have a threshold limit.",

First, the latter is phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues, a process that is dependent upon initial phosphorylation of serine 46 (Law et al., 2003; 2006) . Therefore, we assayed apoptotic resistance of cells expressing wild-type capsid and point mutants in which serine 46 was changed to alanine (S46A) or a phosphomimetic amino acid aspartic acid (S46D). Cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding wild-type and mutant capsid proteins and after 2 days, were challenged with apoptotic stimuli that activate death receptor pathways (anti-Fas) or through intracellular path-ways that detect viral RNA (poly I:C). Apoptosis in the transduced cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies to activated caspase 3. We have previously shown that RV capsid blocks Fas-dependent apoptosis in multiple cell types (Ilkow et al., 2011) however, the effect of poly I:C on capsid-expressing cells has not been investigated previously.",

Cells were infected with viruses encoding wild-type, S46A or S46D capsids followed by treatment with anti-Fas. In Fig. 3 , it can be seen that compared to the mock population treated with anti-Fas, the proportion of apoptotic cells infected with wild-type RV was approximately half. Conversely, infection with S46A virus or S46D virus conferred virtually no protection compared to mockinfected cells. Together, these data are consistent with a scenario where phosphorylation of the RV capsid protein, particularly at Serine 46, is important for its role in blocking apoptosis during virus replication. Interestingly, earlier data from our laboratory showed that infectious titres of recombinant RV strains harbouring S46A mutations are only 10-fold lower than wild-type RV (Law et al., 2003) . Similarly, an S46D mutant RV strain did not exhibit a dramatic replication defect in vitro (data not shown). However, it should be noted that other recombinant RV strains with multiple mutations that impair the antiapoptotic ability of capsid (Ilkow et al., 2011) are extremely unstable and revert to wild-type in less than two passages. As such, it is possible that any significant replication defects associated with the S46A and D mutants are masked by rapid reversion.",

This suggests that even hypo-phosphorylated capsid protein harbours residual anti-apoptotic activity. One mechanism by which RV capsid may block programmed cell death is through sequestration of the pro-apoptotic host protein, Bax (Ilkow et al., 2011) . Accordingly, we questioned whether the mutant capsids, particularly S46A, had a lower affinity for Bax. Surpris-",

It is interesting to note that the least protective capsid mutant S46A\u0394SP was localized predominantly in the nucleolus Fig. 4 . Capsid phosphomutants bind Bax and their elevated expression confers resistance to apoptosis. A. A549 cells were transduced with capsid-encoding lentiviruses using three different multiplicities of transduction. After anti-Fas challenge, apoptotic cells were detected using antibodies to active caspase 3 as described above. Results are based on the averages of three experiments. Bars indicate standard error of the mean. B. A549 cells were transfected with constructs expressing wild-type, S46A or S46D capsids. Lysates were prepared and co-immunoprecipitations were conducted with rabbit anti-Bax or pre-immune serum. Immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to Bax and capsid. whereas a larger proportion of \u0394SP and S46D\u0394SP was detected in the cytoplasm. The punctate cytoplasmic structures to which \u0394SP mutants localized resembled processing bodies (P-bodies), which are RNA-rich granules that function in mRNA metabolism (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009) . Based on colocalization of the anchorless capsid mutants with the P-body marker DCP1 (Fig. 7 , arrowheads), it is tempting to speculate that membraneassociation and possibly phosphorylation, are important to prevent capsid protein from accumulating in these structures, which similar to the nucleolus, have high concentrations of RNA. One major consequence of capsid accumulating in these RNA-rich structures is its loss from the cytoplasm and consequently, ability to interact with host proteins or membranes that function in apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that localization of capsid to cytoplasmic membranes or the E2 SP itself is important for the anti-apoptotic role of RV capsid.",

To this end, we showed that the capsid protein affects several mitochondria-dependent pathways including apoptosis (Ilkow et al., 2008; . The ability of the RV capsid protein to interact with multiple host cell proteins may be related to the fact that its structure is flexible (Mangala Prasad et al., 2013) . Data from the present study indicate that the ability of RV capsid to inhibit apoptosis is a complex process that does not simply involve sequestering the host protein Bax. Indeed, some capsid constructs that do not bind Bax can still protect cells from apoptotic stimuli (Ilkow et al., 2011) suggesting that this viral protein interferes with programmed cell death pathways through more than one mechanism. Certainly, some large DNA viruses employ a multi-pronged strategy to limit apoptosis. Human cytomegalovirus for example, utilizes two different proteins vMIA and vIBO to inhibit Bax and Bak respectively (Goldmacher et al., 1999; Cam et al., 2010) . While the RV capsid does not protect cells from Bak overexpression (Ilkow et al., 2011) , it cannot be ruled out at this point that it affects steps that lead to activation of Bak or Bax for that matter. Recent findings indicate that these proteins can be activated through multiple mechanisms, some of which are rather unconventional. For instance, in addition to promoting Bax and Bak activity through transcriptiondependent mechanisms following detection of viral dsRNA, the transcription factor IRF3 can also activate Bax through direct binding (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010) .",

Cells were transfected with indicated constructs, incubated for 2 days before being labelled with Mitotracker and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Capsid proteins were detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-calnexin was used to detect the endoplasmic reticulum. programmed cell death. Membrane-association per se may not be critical for blocking apoptosis, but rather, localization of capsid to specific cytoplasmic compartments such as the surface of the ER and/or mitochondria. The RV capsid does not possess catalytic activity and therefore changes in its phosphorylation state likely affects intermolecular interactions. For example, the S46A mutant and other hypo-phosphorylated mutants bind RNA with higher affinity than wild-type capsid (Law et al., 2003; 2006) . Given that the S46D phosphomimic mutant is significantly less protective than wild-type capsid, we are left to conclude that serine 46 per se, or the phosphorylated version of this amino acid, plays a critical role in its anti-apoptotic function. While substitution of an aspartate at this position is sufficient to induce downstream phosphorylation of other residues in capsid, it may not mimic phosphoserine well enough to facilitate interaction with host cell proteins involved in apoptosis. Indeed, a hypo-phosphorylated capsid mutant (P3D), in which three phospho-serine/threonine residues in the RNA binding region were changed to aspartates, behaved similarly to S46A in an in vitro RNA-binding assay. Specifically, the aspartates were expected to decrease RNA-binding of capsid but surprisingly, the P3D mutant exhibited significantly higher affinity for viral genomic RNA than wild-type capsid protein (Law et al., 2006) .",

One potential explanation for these seemingly discordant data is that unlike recombinant capsid protein, which is completely devoid of phosphorylation, S46A mutants are not completely devoid of phosphorylation but instead are hypophosphorylated (Law et al., 2003) . High concentrations of non-phosphorylated capsid protein may be toxic for mitochondria and certainly, the ratio of capsid to mitochondria is higher in the in vitro system than in transfected or transduced cells. Indeed, there appears to be a threshold after which recombinant capsid protein behaves in this manner. Specifically, whereas addition of 0.8 \u03bcg of protein to mitochondria had no effect, addition of 2 (or more) \u03bcg resulted in near complete efflux of cytochrome c. Finally, it cannot be ruled out at this point that the 'pro-apoptotic' activity of recombinant capsid is simply an artefact of the in vitro system. Nevertheless, data from the in vitro experiments prompted further investigation, which showed that Fig. 7 . Anchorless capsid mutants localize to areas of high RNA content.

The fact that S46A\u0394SP, which has the lowest anti-apoptotic activity, localizes to organelles with high RNA content (P-bodies and the nucleus/ nucleolus) is consistent with this idea. Indeed, even a pool of anchor-less but still phosphorylated capsid (\u0394SP) localized to these RNA-rich structures. Whether this has any bearing on the inherent differences between RV capsid and the closely related alphavirus capsid proteins is debatable. However, given that cells infected with alphaviruses generally produce much higher levels of antigen than RV-infected cells, it is possible that alphaviruses can better tolerate the mis-localization of a pool of their capsid proteins away from replication and/or assembly sites. With the exception of hantavirus nucleocapsid, a pool of which localizes to P-bodies in order to fulfil a role in 5\u2032 cap-snatching (Mir et al., 2008) , RNA virus capsid proteins have not been reported to associate with cytoplasmic RNA granules. In fact, it is well documented that other togaviruses and flaviruses inhibit formation of these RNA-rich granules which are thought to function in anti-viral defence (McInerney et al., 2005; Emara and Brinton, 2007; Fros et al., 2012; Panas et al., 2012) .",

For example, in vesicular stomatitis virus-infected cells, phosphorylation of P protein, which binds to the capsid protein (N), prevents N protein from binding cellular RNAs (Chen et al., 2013) . Trafficking of several other viral capsid proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus including those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid and West Nile virus is affected by phosphorylation (Surjit et al., 2005; You et al., 2005; Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010) . As with RV capsid, phosphorylation of these proteins also affects RNA binding (Chen et al., 2005; Cheong and Ng, 2011) .",

In general, very little is known about how capsids or other proteins encoded by RNA viruses, function to inhibit apoptosis. Because there are so many ways to activate programmed cell death, it is likely that other viral proteins that function analogously to RV capsid act through multiple pathways. Indeed, as well as blocking death receptor-dependent apoptosis (Ilkow et al., 2011) , in the present study, we show that RV capsid interferes IRF3-dependent apoptosis [induced by poly(I:C)]. Through identification of cellular kinases and membrane-associated host proteins that interact with virus capsids and/or other proteins, we will gain a better understanding of how these multifunctional proteins act at various stages of the virus life cycle.",
