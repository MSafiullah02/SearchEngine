Mother-to-child transmission, also known as vertical transmission, accounts for more than 40% of all HIV-1 infections in children [2] and can occur in three ways [3], [4], [5]: during pregnancy through the placenta (transplacental or intrauterine transmission); during delivery (intrapartum transmission) through amniotic fluids, infected blood and cervical secretions; and during the process of breastfeeding. In addition, some independent factors have been associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1, such as high maternal viral load, low amount of CD4+ T cells, vaginal delivery and lower gestational age [4], [5].",

PRRs are involved in phagocytosis, and antigen presentation could activate intracellular signaling and cytokine secretion. The efficiency of this initial pathogen recognition may have important consequences in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases [8].",

They present strong dependence on calcium and act as cellular adhesion's receptors and are involved in pathogen recognition [16], [17]. As pathogen-recognition receptors, both these lectins recognize a wide range of microorganisms, some of which have a major impact on public health. For example, DC-SIGN captures viruses, such as Ebola virus [18], hepatitis C virus [19], [20], Dengue virus [21], cytomegalovirus [22], and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [23], [24], bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n[25] and Helicobacter pylori\n[26], and parasites such as Leishmania pifanoi\n[27]. L-SIGN is able to capture viruses such as Ebola virus [18], hepatitis C virus [19], [20], [28], and more recently SARS-CoV [23], [29], as well as bacteria such as M tuberculosis\n[30], and Leishmania infantum\n[27].

By using a series of recombinant soluble receptors with different number of repeats, Synder et al. [39] showed that the binding affinity to HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein was affected by the length of the repeats and multimerization status, with tetrameric forms presenting a higher affinity than shorter monomeric forms. The CRD, both in DC-SIGN and L-SIGN, is flexibly connected to the neck repeat region, allowing a departure from the membrane, which enables the binding of pathogens in a calcium-dependent manner [36].",

As mentioned before, DC-SIGN can bind to the gp120 protein of HIV-1 [41], [42], [50] capturing the virus and possibly increasing HIV-1 transmission [12]. Similar to DC-SIGN, L-SIGN also captures the HIV-1 virus by binding to the gp120 and promoting the enhancement of T cell infection by HIV-1 in trans\n[17], [34]; however, L-SIGN can also internalize the virus and promote virus degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner, possibly directly affecting the outcome of the infection by HIV-1 [5]. The presence of L-SIGN on the surface of endothelial cells in lymph node sinuses represents an obvious mechanism by which the virus can be transmitted to CD4+ cells that traffic into lymph nodes via the afferent lymphatics. In addition, since L-SIGN binds to ICAM-3 and may bind to other cell surface receptors, interactions between T-cells and the endothelial cell surface may occur more frequently, increasing the likelihood of virus transmission [9].",

Alternatively, the binding of viral particles to the DCs may increase the probability that entry will occur after binding to the CD4 and co-receptor complex on target cells [10]. The ability of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN receptors to capture and transmit the HIV-1 to T cells may largely depend on their membrane organization in rafts or their capability to multimerize [10]. In addition, alternative splicing events can occur in DC-SIGN e L-SIGN, leading to the production of a vast repertoire of membrane-bound and soluble isoforms, which may also differently affect the process of HIV-1 transmission [5], [17], [52].",

Most cases of vertical transmission via uterus occur through of the placenta (Fig. 4\n), especially during the third trimester of pregnancy [43]. It is estimated that the trans-placental or intrauterine HIV-1 transfer comprise 17\u201338% of cases of vertical transmission, but little is known about the mechanisms involved in the transmission of the virus [54]. Some cell types are pointed out as likely targets for the viral spread, such as macrophages present in the decidua and specialized macrophages present in the placenta (Fig. 4), also known as Hofbauer cells [54].

During pregnancy, there is an increased expression of DC-SIGN by Hofbauer cells in the chorionic villi, and this expression has been correlated with increased rates of HIV-1 vertical transmission [54]. Thus, DC-SIGN can enhance the binding of HIV-1 on the surface of Hofbauer cells, providing an efficient mechanism by which the virus can be transmitted to other receivers permissible to HIV-1 in trans.

The second mechanism is that Hofbauer cell infected by HIV-1 or carrying the virus adsorbed on the surface, remains in situ in the chorionic villi, promoting HIV-1 antigen presentation and subsequent T lymphocytes infection. However, this mechanism seems unlikely, since T lymphocytes are inconspicuous in chorionic villi [54], [55]. The third mechanism argues that Hofbauer cells may become infected by HIV-1 and may release infectious viral particles, which may become adsorbed to L-SIGN on the immediately adjacent placental capillary endothelium. The endothelium may, in turn, mediate infection of HIV-1 receptor\u2013positive T-lymphocytes circulating in the blood. Infected T lymphocytes or Hofbauer cells either productively infected with HIV-1 or simply with the virus adsorbed to their surface may then travel between the placenta and the fetus in umbilical cord blood [16], [54], [55].",

The fact that the free viral particles loose their infectivity when exposed to acidic environments, suggest that the transmission of the virus to free cells in milk is hampered by gastric juice [60]. However, it is possible that free cells become infected in the oral mucosa and esophagus, where the acidity is not high. Studies with Raji cells expressing DC-SIGN, preincubated with PBS and with the HIV-1 virus, showed an efficient viral transfer. However, Raji cells expressing DC-SIGN, incubated with HIV-1 virus and uninfected human milk, showed a significant reduction of the binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN receptor. This suggests that in human milk some factors that could prevent the interaction between the gp120 and DC-SIGN receptor exist [4].",

Some studies attribute this reduction in viral transmission to certain antigens, such as Lewis structures, which compete with the gp120 for a binding site in the DC-SIGN receptor, inhibiting the viral transfer to CD4+ T cells [2]. Inhibition of the binding between gp120 and DC-SIGN receptor is probably due to the size of the compound, which contains many Lewis structures that mask the interaction sites [4]. Compounds containing Lewis structures and present in breast milk were shown to interact with DC-SIGN, blocking the response of Th1 cells and resulting in an increased responsiveness of Th2 cells, suggesting that these compounds may influence the immune response by acting as immunomodulatory factors [4]. A constituent of human milk, bile salt-stimulated lipase, a Lewis X (Lex)\u2013containing glycoprotein secreted by the pancreas as well as by mammary gland, has been shown to inhibit DC-SIGN binding to HIV and DC-SIGN-mediated transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ lymphocytes, by competing with the virus for the binding to DC-SIGN [62]. The binding of bile salt-stimulated lipase to DC-SIGN can be prevented using an antibody against Lex, thus demonstrating the importance of the Le [10] epitope.",

The membrane bound L-SIGN receptors are responsible for catching the virus. After capture, the virus adhered to L-SIGN may undergo degradation processes or be presented as antigens. Thus, these receptors act to protect the infant against infection by HIV-1 [5]. Boily-Larouche et al. [5] explain these discoveries with the hypothesis that when the levels of placental L-SIGN-bound membrane are reduced, virus fails to bind to L-SIGN and binds preferentially to CCR5 receptors on endothelial cells of capillaries, resulting in loss of integrity of the placental barrier and increase the passage of cells infected by HIV-1 in fetal circulation, leading to vertical transmission.",
