Public health measures have to adapt to new health threats and methods of disease control.

Epidemiology refers to the study of the distribution and changes in diseases. Epidemiological methods are used to assess incubation periods, causative agents, mode of spread, community trends as well as preventive measures. The age-old accepted principles of prevention and spread of communicable diseases are implemented. With data available to us, we commence empirical treatment irrespective of the manifestations of the disease. At the same time, supportive treatment goes hand-in-hand with the empirical treatment. As and when the exact agent is identified, we then commence the specific treatment. If a drug is available against the putative agent, we then change the empirical treatment into the definitive treatment. Based on our knowledge of incubation periods, causative agents and mode of spread, the specific preventive measures are implemented. After preliminary identification of the causative agent, the Koch's postulates are ascertained.",

SARS is known to be caused by a type of coronavirus, termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 2, 3 The novel agent does not belong to any known groups of coronaviruses. The genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that it is an animal virus that has either developed the ability to infect humans or has been able to cross the species barrier. 4 The virus is spread by droplets or by direct or indirect contact. The infectious virus is present at very high concentrations in the respiratory tract of patients. At least one serious outbreak in a public hospital in Hong Kong could have been due to the use of nebulized bronchodilator (albuterol, through a jet nebuliser delivered by oxygen at high flow rates). This is believed to cause atomization of infected secretions.",
