            "text": "We consider the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, modeled by a standard SIR compartmental model. The control of the epidemic is induced by the aggregation of individuals' decisions to limit their social interactions: on one side, when the epidemic is ongoing, an individual is encouraged to diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting infected, but, on the other side, this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster but the effort cost may be high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed, resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. However, it is not clear that the individual's interest aligns with that of the society. We prove that the equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. The equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis. We show that the divergence between the individual and societal strategies happens after the epidemic peak but while significant propagation is still underway.",

            "text": "As of April 10th 2020, almost half of world population is under strong restrictions (lockdown) enforced by local governments to limit the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions mainly concern the reduction of social interactions. They are instantiated at different geographical scales (house-holdings, towns, states, countries...) and already had a significant worldwide economic impact. All individuals affected by epidemic control measures pay a cost in terms of health (reports show an under-reporting of severe illnesses such as hearth, ischemic strokes, ...), time, money, social interactions, psychological pressure (domestic violence increased), etc. However, until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes immune (by infection or vaccination), the choice of control measures together with an adequate tracking of the virus spread are key to limit the epidemic as well as the social and economic impacts of the contact rate decay. In such context, each individual needs to balance the individual and collective outcomes of his/her behavior, when choosing his/her level of social interaction with the population. For instance, he/she may be tempted to use the so-called \"free lunch\" strategy, i.e., take advantage of the low epidemic activity (due to others' efforts) while not contributing to the effort himself/herself. However, population benefits are at stake because the epidemic dynamics is induced by the aggregation of individual decisions. In practice, an equilibrium is formed between the individuals and we analyze in this work this equilibrium.",

Introduced by Lasry and Lions in [34, 35, 36] and independently by Huang, Caines, and Malham\u00e9 [29, 26, 27, 28] , Mean Field Games focus on the derivation of a Nash equilibrium within a population containing an infinite number of individuals, see [14] for a complete mathematical description. Such asymptotic viewpoint simplifies the game theoretic analysis of the interactions among the population, as typically the impact of each individual over the entire population can be neglected. It is worth pointing out that the optimal strategy in a Mean Field game provides approximate Nash equilibrium for similar games involving a finite number of players (see [14] ). Fields of applications of Mean Field games, mentioned in [24] , include energy [21] , finance [15, 22] , crowd modeling [3] , and also epidemic dynamics [8, 32, 33, 30, 47] . These latter works focus on the impact of individual vaccination decisions on the dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we follow a similar approach but study the impact of individual decisions concerning distancing and isolation, in an epidemic dynamics where no vaccination is (yet) available.",

Early work of [1, 2] focuses on the optimal vaccination timing of individuals, while combined with cost free instantaneous isolation strategy. More realistic impacts and constraints on the quarantine and isolation strategies have been considered in [39, 57] or [9, 25] . The main objective of such policy is to control the reproduction number of the epidemic (see [42] ) together with limiting the social and economic impact of such policy. An other part of the literature (see [23, 46, 45, 20, 19, 11, 56] for example) tries to model and to take into account the individual behavioral response to isolation policy in such context. Such modeling of individual response is of course greatly influenced by cultural habits together with societal, economic or religious need for social interactions. The addition of such individual based feedback effect on quarantine governmental policy is key in the modeling of optimal control for epidemic dynamics. The main outcome of this paper is to provide an easily tractable modeling approach for such a purpose.",

Each individual chooses optimally his/her contact rate with others, striking a balance between the cost of being infected by the virus, and the cost induced by reducing social interactions. On one hand, the epidemic dynamics is induced by the aggregation of all individual contact rate decisions. On the other hand, the epidemic level influences the contamination probability of each individual and hereby their own contact rate. We prove that a Mean Field Nash equilibrium is reached among the population and we quantify the impact of individual choice between epidemic risk and other unfavorable outcomes. Numerical experiments show that the self isolation equilibrium strategy is characterized by a quick contact rate reduction followed by a slower return to the usual social interaction level. It allows to reduce significantly the proportion of infected individuals required in order to achieve herd immunity.",

This includes the individuals who potentially did not survive the epidemic, as well as the individuals tested positive and isolated in a perfect quarantine.

Although the society cannot modify the disease characteristics, it can produce (possibly strong) incentives to each individual to reduce his/her contact rate with other individuals in the population. This mitigation strategy (lockdown) has been chosen by many countries during the Covid-19 epidemic propagation, some countries starting strict measures in January (China) while other countries in February, March and so on; this is implemented in order to slow down the epidemic propagation. However, for each individual, reducing the contact rate with others comes at a cost, as described in the introduction (health hazards, psychological pressures, loss of social relationships, income uncertainty...) and it may even expose the individual to yet unknown risks. The latter is especially true for long epidemics that require substantial efforts from the individuals. On the other hand, if everybody else lowers his/her own contact rate then the epidemic diffusion will be vanishing and a given individual, having this knowledge, can act as a free-rider and effectively increase his/her contact rate without too much risk.",

We plot in Figure 2 the convergence towards the minimal cost; the decay of the cost is very fast in terms of the learning time h. The contact rate at equilibrium is represented in the right plot, while the empirical convergence of the algorithm is confirmed by its superposition with the approximate contact rate computed at the previous step.

First, at the beginning of the epidemic, the number I of infected people is relatively low. Individuals make therefore no effort in order to reduce their social interactions and the virus is transmitted at the normal rate \u03b2 0 . This leads to a large augmentation in the proportion of Infected, implying a significant increase of the individual's probability of contracting the virus. In response to this, individuals begin to reduce significantly their social interactions, implying a strong reduction of the transmission rate of the disease. Finally, after the epidemic peak, all individuals slowly reduce their effort until the number of infected people is relatively close to 0. Table 1 . Solid lines represent the evolution at the Mean Field Nash equilibrium, i.e., with transmission rate \u03b2 . The evolution at equilibrium is compared to the epidemic dynamics with constant transmission rate \u03b2 0 (dashed lines). Figure 3 provides a comparison between the SIR dynamics of the Mean Field Nash equilibrium (solid lines), and the one generated by the no-effort strategy \u03b2 0 (dashed lines). Even if driven by self-interest, individual efforts do reduce social interactions population-wise. This can be explained as follows. First, we observe that the proportion R T of recovered at terminal date drops from 80% to 60% when the population is applying the Mean Field Nash equilibrium strategy. This means that the proportion of the population spared by the virus goes from 20% in the case without effort to 40% at equilibrium. Second, one can observe that the infection peak occurring around t = 50 days is twice less critical at equilibrium, but, as a counterpart, the epidemic lasts longer as the number of infected decreases more slowly after the epidemic peak. As the infection peak is less critical, it limits, and may even prevent, the saturation of the healthcare facilities. Although not represented in our model, this necessarily implies a decrease in the mortality rate of the virus.",

The cost induced for each individual is around 210.78, which is lower than the one around 211.33 associated to the equilibrium over B. Moreover, we observe that the induced SIR dynamics provides a lower epidemic size R T together with a lower proportion of infected at the epidemic peak, hereby reducing the potential mortality rate induced by the virus. This observation enlightens as well how the Mean Field Nash equilibrium \u03b2 in B is not optimal for the society as a whole, as it can be improved by restricting the set of admissible strategies toB. This observation leads us to look towards the optimal societal contact rate for the population as a whole.",

In our framework, we can compute, through classical optimization procedures (e.g., the Pontryagin principle), the optimal control of the transmission rate from the society point of view. We refer to the literature previously cited for the details on the techniques allowing to find this optimal control and we only present here the numerical results. Note that in such context there are several additional, classical, procedures available to compute the optimal control (see for instance the forward-backward sweep method in [37, Chapter 4] ).

One can observe that for both Mean Field Nash equilibrium strategies, the control period starts and ends earlier in comparison to the societal optimum situation. Indeed, on one hand, individuals engage in preventive measures by decreasing their interactions earlier than a global planner would recommend, due to fear of the infection spreading. On the other hand, they release their efforts just after the peak of infection, whereas a global planner would recommend maintaining a relatively high level of effort in order to avoid further spreading of the virus. Therefore, while the Nash equilibrium of individuals allows, through premature efforts, to decrease the peak of infection, the socially optimal strategy allows a more rapid decrease in the proportion of infected after the peak, by maintaining intense efforts.

The transmission rate of the disease induced by the Nash equilibrium allows a clear improvement in the evolution of the epidemic, compared to the evolution with the initial transmission rate \u03b2 0 , which corresponds to the transmission rate of the disease without any effort of the population. In particular, despite the selfishness of individuals (who only seek to minimize their own cost), their efforts make possible to reduce the number of people affected by the disease by 25%. In addition, the infection peak is less critical, which limits, and may even prevent, the saturation of the health care system and a corresponding decrease in the mortality rate of the virus.",

To quantify this difference, we numerically compute the societal-wide optimum, in order to compare the two strategies and to evaluate the so-called cost of anarchy. We observe that, while the Nash equilibrium of the individuals allows, through premature efforts due to fear of infection, to decrease the peak of infected, the societal-wide optimal strategy allows a more rapid decrease in the proportion infected after the peak, by maintaining intense efforts. Therefore, there is a cost of anarchy, meaning that the Nash equilibrium induces a higher cost than the societal optimum. Another conclusion is that the divergence between the centralized epidemic control rules and the individual optimal behavior arrives after the peak of the epidemic at a point where the epidemic decreases but is not yet over.",
