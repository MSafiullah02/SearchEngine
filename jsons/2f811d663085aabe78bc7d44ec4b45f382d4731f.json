In the 21 st century, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) both caused worldwide epidemics with high morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] . Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has spread globally with alarming infections and deaths [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [11] , which is also a highly contagious disease [9, 12, 13] . As of April 11, 2020, there have been 83 400 confirmed infections, 3 349 fatalities in China, and 1 623 873 confirmed cases with 99 617 deaths in 209 other countries [14, 15] . The SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to be transmitted by respiratory droplets, viral aerosols, close contacts, and self-inoculation to nose, mouth, or eyes after touching a contaminated surface [16] . However, there are still many controversies about the airborne transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV on inanimate surfaces. We therefore reviewed the persistence and infectivity of viruses on inanimate surfaces to provide clear information for containing the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.",

Before routine cleaning, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were positive with 13 (87%) of 15 room sites (including air outlet fans) and 3 (60%) of 5 toilet sites (toilet bowl, sink, and door handle), suggesting that the ward environment was extensively contaminated and that viral shedding in stool could be a potential route of transmission. Anteroom and corridor samples were negative. One COVID-19 patient had upper respiratory tract infection with no pneumonia or diarrhea, and his two stool samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. After routine cleaning of the room, samples collected from another two patients were negative. Only one swab from the surface of a shoe front was positive. All air samples were negative [17] despite the extent of environmental contamination. Swabs taken from the air exhaust outlets tested positive, suggesting that small virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and deposited on equipment such as vents [17] . The risk of transmission from contaminated footwear is likely low, as evidenced by negative results in the anteroom and clean corridor.",

            "text": "To investigate the possibility of SARS-CoV transmission in the air [21] , air samples were obtained from seven wards and balconies in hospital at a frequency of three times daily for three continuous days. The N protein gene of SARS-CoV was amplified with RT-PCR, and 29.03% of air samples in the wards and 20.0% of samples in balconies were positive for SARS-CoV; sequential analysis of the positive samples showed that the identity of amplified cDNA fragments to the known SARS-CoV strains was 98%. A strain of live pathogen was isolated and could cause typical cytopathic effects, similar to that of SARS-CoV on Vero-E6 cells, and the effects could be stably passed [21] . This study indicates that SARS-CoV could exist in the air where SARS patients live, but the infectivity of SARS-CoV in air samples is very weak. Viral nucleic acids, as well as viable seasonal and avian influenza viruses, have been detected in aerosols in the air in healthcare settings or in buses. The viral RNA of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was recovered in the air in pediatric or adult ambulatory care clinics, while only a small percentage of them were in particles \u2264 5 \u03bcm [22] . A recent report in China shows the clustered aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in buses [23] . Infected with SARS-CoV-2 but unaware of that, patient zero travelled in a fully enclosed air conditioned bus from place A to B. During his twohour journey on the bus, he had infected eight passengers, one of which was asymptomatic. At place B, patient zero commuted to another bus right away, and infected two of 12 passengers during this one-hour travel. The bus was not disinfected at the bus station at place B, and 30 min later, shuttled more passengers back to place A. Among them, a passenger sat beside the seat where patient zero was previously seated, and was confirmed to be infected 2 d later, suggesting that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces or in aerosol flows in closed buses may last at least 30 min. The distance from patient zero to his infected persons is 0.5-4.5 m. Patient zero and all of the 11 infected passengers in the bus did not wear masks, of which two infected passengers infected two other persons. Thus, patient zero caused a total of 13 human SARS-CoV-2 infections [23] . Another study found infection of RSV virus from the air obtained over 1 m away from RSV-positive hospitalized infants, which were still present 2 h after the infected infants were discharged [24] . Yip et al [25] studied the air samples emitted by 16 patients infected with influenza virus. The air samples adjacent to these patients (0.5-1.0 m and 2.1-2.5 m away) were collected using bio-aerosol samplers, respectively. 37.5% of the air samples emitted by these patients were tested positive in viral RNA for all tested particle sizes (< 1, 1-4, and > 5 \u03bcm), which indicates that the viruses exist in the air inclose proximity to the patients. There was no correlation between the nasal viral load of the patients and viral RNA recovery from the air, and there was no significant association between RNA detection from the air and demographics or clinical presentation [25] .",

When pathogens become airborne, they travel in particles of different sizes and compositions. Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the viruses. The concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport IAV as well as the viral viability for each particle size range were assessed on experimentally infected pigs, including samples from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus exhaled by acutely infected pigs. An Andersen cascade impactor being able to separate particles by size (0.4-10 \u03bcm in diameter) was used to collect aerosols from experimentally infected pigs for 24 d. Infectious status was demonstrated for the three viruses. Quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that airborne porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, IAV, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus can be found in a wide range of particle sizes.
