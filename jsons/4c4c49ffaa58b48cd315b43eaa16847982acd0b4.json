            "text": "The potential effect of the copper intake on the microbiota profile of pigs, chickens and cows was reviewed through an extensive literature search. A total of 28 (out of 229), 17 (out of 106) and 0 (out of 114) references were considered relevant for pigs, chickens and cows, respectively. The overall conclusion from the studies with piglets and growing pigs is that copper, even at low concentrations (<50 mg/kg feed), may affect the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract. Especially, the population of clostridia and coliform bacteria seems to be affected by low copper concentrations. At higher concentrations (>170 mg/kg feed) Cu as CuSO 4 reduces the population of lactobacilli in piglets as well as growing pigs. In slaughter pigs, the addition of Cu as CuSO 4 reduces the population of streptococci in colonic and fecal samples, the population of ureolytic bacteria in the colon of which streptococci make up 74%, the urease activity in the colon, and decarboxylation and deamination of amino acids in the small intestine. No effect of Cu as CuSO 4 on the population of streptococci and on urease activity is seen in piglets. Supplementing piglet diets with 100 to 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 significantly change the community structure of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract by reducing the number of bacterial species and reducing the similarity of the microbiota. The overall conclusion from the studies with broilers is that copper, even at low concentrations (<50 mg/kg feed), may affect the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract. Especially the population of clostridia seems to be affected by low copper concentrations. In particular, copper bound clay minerals seem to have an effect. At higher concentrations (>200 mg/kg feed) inorganic or organic bound copper also seems to affect the population of lactobacilli and coliform bacteria, to reduce the pH in gizzard content and to produce severe gizzard erosion.",

Published scientific papers have addressed this issue and it seems there is a relationship between levels of dietary copper in animals and differences in their gastrointestinal microbiota, which in turn may result e.g. in more nutrients becoming available for absorption; 3 the mode of actions have also been recently studied. 4 A possible outcome of the opinion might be a recommendation of different maximum levels compared to those currently authorised in feed (Table 1) . Therefore it is necessary to know the potential effects of a variation in copper intake levels on the gut microbiota profile of the target animals which might be accounted in the FEEDAP Panel opinion. Piglets should be particularly considered in this literature search, as this is animal category for which the maximum copper in feed is allowed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2003 5 ; at least, two other relevant animal species/categories (chickens for fattening, dairy cows, fish, cat, dog) shall be included. The project should be accomplished in a structured manner, that is following an Extensive Literature Search (ELS) process. The steps listed below should be followed and duly documented under the present Call for tender:",

The effect of copper on the population density and composition of streptococci was investigated in two studies with piglets (P142 and P147) and four experiments with growing pigs (P111, P143, P144 and P145). With piglets no significant effect in the fecal counts of streptococci were found in study P142 experiment 2 and study P142 experiment 3 (Bunch et al., 1961) neither by feeding the piglets 125, 250 or 375 mg/kg Cu as CuO or by feeding them 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 . There was, however, a numerical reduction in streptococci in both experiments by feeding 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 . No significant reduction in the population of streptococci was found by feeding piglets with 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 in study P147 (Kellog et al., 1964) . In study P111 (Varel et al., 1987) with growing pigs, 49 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 reduced the number of ureoluytic organisms in fecal samples with a marked decrease in the Streptococcus spp., which made up 74% of the ureolytic bacteria in fecal samples from pigs fed the control diet. A marked fall in the number of streptococci in fecal samples was found in study P143 (Fuller et al., 1960) when growing pigs were fed 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 compared to pigs fed a control diet. The extent of the reduction varied but the counts of streptococci in the copper treated pigs were always lower than in the control pigs and the reduction could be as much as from 10 9 to 10 3 CFU/g faeces. In study P144 (experiments 2, 3 and 4), a significant reduction of streptococci in fecal samples of growing pigs was found in experiment 2 and 4 while only a numerical reduction was found in experiment 3 by supplementing the diet of growing pigs with 250 mg/kg CuSO 4 . In study P145 (Hendericks et al., 1982) , it was concluded that CuSO 4 (concentration of Cu not given) strongly inhibited the growth of streptococci in an ex vivo experiment with SI content from growing pigs. In conclusion the results strongly indicate that supplementation with 100 mg Cu/kg, or higher, as CuSO 4 significantly reduces the population of streptococci in the gastrointestinal tract of growing pigs. The effect of CuSO 4 on the population of streptococci in piglets is more questionable.",

However in studies P41, P72 and P80 it was shown that supplementing piglet diets with high amounts of copper (100 to 250 mg/kg) as CuSO 4 affect the number of bacterial species in ileal (P80), in caecal (P41 and P72) and in colonic (P80) digesta. Furthermore, in study P80 addition of 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 significantly reduced the degree of similarity of the microbiota in ileal samples compared to pigs fed a diet without supplementary copper addition. As also pointed out by the authors in study P85, the combination of faecal samples and the microbial methods used in their study may not have been sensitive enough to detect differences among the dietary treatments. In study P80, the similarity analysis further shows that the piglets did restore a diverse microbiota 2 weeks after withdrawal from the high Cu diet, but the community structure still seems to be different from that in the control fed pigs. In general, the community structure studies strongly suggest that supplementing piglet diets with 100 to 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 change the microbial community in the small intestine, the caecum and the colon.

In contrast, the addition of 175 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 to the feed had no significance on the concentration of lactate in any segments of the gastrointestinal tract, but counteracted the accumulation of lactate found in the high ZnO fed piglets in caecum and colon. In study P103 (Song et al., 2013) , the concentration of D-lactate was measured in plasma samples. D-lactate is produced by the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract and absorbed to the blood. Mammals do not have the enzymatic system to metabolise D-lactate so plasma D-lactate may be a measurement of the microbial activity in the gastrointestinal tract. A significant reduction in plasma D-lactate was found in study P103 in pigs fed 36 mg/kg Cu as either Cu-CaMontmorillonite or Cu-NaMontmorillonite compared to the control fed pigs, indicating a reduced fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract in the piglets fed the copper supplemented diets.

The effect of copper on the population of streptococci was investigated in three experiments with broilers from two studies (CH5 and CH34 experiment 1 and 2).

The comparison similarity coefficients, however, revealed that the mucosa-associated bacterial communities of birds fed 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 had higher similarity indices than either the control or bacitracin fed broilers.

On day 34 eight birds per treatment were slaughtered and the bacterial community structure analysed in samples of ileal content and samples of ileal mucosa. Neither Cu supplementation at 187.5 mg/kg nor Cu sources affected the number of predominant bacterial species (DGGE band number) in ileal content (mean = 9.6) or ileal mucosa (mean = 8.6). Furthermore, neither Cu supplementation at 187.5 mg/kg nor Cu sources (CuSO 4 or TBCC) affected the similarity coefficient of the microbial community structure in ileal content. However supplementation of the diet with 187.5 mg/kg Cu as TBCC increased the similarity coefficient of ileal mucosal bacteria, while supplementing the diet with 187.5 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 did not affect the similarity coefficient of ileal mucosal bacteria. This shows that the mucosa associated microbiota was more similar between individual birds for the TBCC fed broilers, compared to the control and the CuSO 4 fed birds. In conclusion the effect of copper supplementation of broiler diets seems to have little effect on the community structure of the microbiota in the small intestine. No effect of supplementing broiler diets with either 188 or 250 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 or 188 mg/kg Cu as TBCC were found on band numbers (number of bacterial species) neither in digesta samples nor in mucosal samples.

Again increasing gizzard erosion indices were evident in birds fed the copper supplemented diets; both in the birds fed the low and the high fat diet.

Gizzard erosion was measured as described for study CH5 in four birds per treatment after 42 days on the experimental diets. Again severe gizzard erosion was observed in the birds fed the copper supplemented diets (0.0, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.0 for the control fed birds and the birds fed 200 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 , Cu-methionine and Cu-fish meal, respectively). In study CH34 experiments 1 and 2 (Min et al., 1993) , gizzard erosion was investigated for five sources of copper all added to the diets to increase the Cu concentration with 200 mg/kg. The five copper sources were CuSO 4 , a Cu-starch complex, a Cu-starch/methionine complex, a Cumethionine complex and a Na-Alginate Cu complex. Regardless of copper sources, severe gizzard erosion was observed in all broilers fed copper supplemented diets in all four studies where it was investigated. In conclusion, supplementation of broiler diets with copper at concentrations above 125 mg/kg strongly increases gizzard erosion.",

The number of characteristics investigated in the individual studies varied from 1 to 15. The number of studies in which each characteristic was studied varied from 1 to 18. The characteristic studied could be divided in 8 themes: Plate count of bacteria (21 studies), qPCR of bacterial populations (1 study), microscopic counts of bacteria (1 study), community structure analyses (4 studies), gut content characteristics (9 studies), microbial metabolites (4 studies), microbial activity (5 studies) and studies in germ free pigs (1 study). The copper concentrations used in the studies varied from 1.5 to 375 mg/kg feed. Four types of copper sources were used in the studies: inorganic bound copper (23 studies at concentrations from 26-375 mg/kg feed), organic bound copper (5 studies at concentrations from 13-134 mg/kg feed), copper bound to clay minerals (5 studies at concentrations from 36-49 mg/kg feed) and copper-loaded nanoparticles (1 study at a concentration of 1.5 mg/kg). It may be concluded from the experiments that supplementing pig diets with low additional copper amounts (below 50 mg/kg Cu) seems to inhibit the population of coliform bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of as well piglets as growing pigs. In particular, clay bound copper seems to be effective. When supplemented to the feed in amounts above 100 mg/kg copper, the effect on the population of coliform bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets as well as pigs was marginal.",

The copper concentrations used in the studies varied from 8 to 375 mg/kg feed. Four types of copper sources were used in the studies: inorganic bound copper (13 studies at concentrations from 8-375 mg/kg feed), organic bound copper (8 studies at concentrations from 50-200 mg/kg feed), copper bound to clay minerals (2 studies at concentrations from 25-37 mg/kg feed) and copper-loaded nanoparticles (1 study at a concentration from 34-68 mg/kg).",

In studyP103 (Song et al., 2013), piglets were fed 36 mg/kg Cu as either Cu-CaMontmorillonite or Cu-NaMontmorillonite. Both copper sources significantly reduce the incidences of diarrhoea compared to the control fed pigs. In study P116(Wang et al., 2011), significantly lower diarrhea incidence was observed in piglets fed a diet supplemented with 1.5 mg/kg Cu as Cu-Chitosan nanoparticles compared to the control fed piglets. However, although numerical lower, the incidence of diarrhoea was not significantly lower than in piglets fed copper free Chitosan nanoparticles. In studyP124 (Xia   et al., 2004), supplementation of the diet with 47 mg/kg Cu as Cu-Montmorillonite decreased the mean diarrhoea incidence from 19.2% in the control fed piglets to 5.4% in the copper fed piglets. In study P146(Huang et al., 2010), diets supplemented with either 67 or 134 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 or 67 or 134 mg/kg Cu as Cu-Citrate all reduced the incidence of diarrhoea compared to the control fed pigs. However the results for the pigs fed the diet supplemented with 67 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 was not statistically different from the control fed pigs. In conclusion supplementation of pig diets with additional copper seems to reduce diarrhoea incidences.Odour quality. The effect of dietary copper on the faecal odour characteristics was investigated in two experiments with piglets (P140 and P141) and in one experiment with growing pigs (P140). In studyP140 (Armstrong et al., 2000), piglets weaned at 18 to 22 days of age were fed a control diet and five experimental diets supplemented either 66 mg/kg, 225 mg/kg Cu as CuSO 4 , 33 mg/kg Cu as Cu Citrate, 66 mg/kg Cu as Cu Citrate or 100 mg/kg Cu as Cu Citrate.
