Infection caused by these viruses may result in severe disease and high case fatality rates because most humans have no background immunity to these viruses. Sporadic human cases due to avian A(H5N6),3 A(H10N8)4 and A(H6N1)5 have also emerged in recent years. The global circulation of oseltamivir\u2010resistant seasonal influenza, the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009 followed by its continual circulation,6 the rising number of A(H7N9) infections in humans2 and the ongoing spread of A(H5N8) in recent months in the poultry populations in many countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and Middle East with pandemic potential7 all point to an urgent need for developing more effective antiviral therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical, diagnostic and treatment aspects of these important and emerging influenza viruses that are posing threats to human health in the Asia\u2010Pacific region.",

This, together with the widespread infection with different subtypes in various animal species, allows robust evolution through the process of \u2018reassortment\u2019. The prerequisite for reassortment is a simultaneous infection with more than one strain of viruses in a host referred to as the \u2018mixing vessel\u2019 that allows replication and swabbing of gene segments between different strains of viruses. Water birds are well\u2010known mixing vessels, but the reassortants are more likely to have a tropism restricted to avian species. These new reassortants may pose problems in the land birds and poultry, and subsequently be of human concern. Swine is another well\u2010known mixing vessel. The unique property of swine is their susceptibility to both avian and human influenza viruses. Thus, reassortants from swine are more likely to gain tropism for infection in humans. Field observations made as early as 1990s have pointed out that influenza outbreaks that began with either pigs or people were then rapidly transferred to each other.11 Swine are likely to play the role of a mixing vessel in creating pandemic strains. Although the 1918 pandemic strain was most probably an entirely avian\u2010like virus,12 the 1957 and 1968 pandemic strains were reassortants of human\u2010 and avian\u2010origin viruses.13\n",
