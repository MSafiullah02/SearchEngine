The term \u201cupper respiratory tract infection\u201d (URTI) encompasses a number of conditions that have a variable and diverse range of presentations, due to the number of adjacent anatomical sites involved, causative organisms and several host and environmental factors. \u201cURTI\u201d is therefore a nonspecific term used to describe acute infections involving the upper respiratory tract (nose, paranasal sinuses, ear, pharynx, and larynx) (Fig. 1.1). It is, however, rather imprecise as it incorrectly implies an absence of lower respiratory tract pathology, when clearly such pathology may often co-exist with upper respiratory tract disease [1]. Acute URTIs are an important part of general practice visits: A national study suggested that they comprise roughly 10% of all GP consultations [2]. Viral URTIs cause considerable financial burden, also in association to their comorbidities [3]. Often regarded as trivial, URTIs do not receive the attention they merit if their enormous incidence, morbidity and occasionally serious sequelae are taken into consideration [4].\n",

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been recently identified in samples from RSV-negative children with bronchiolitis [6], while human bocavirus (BoV) was discovered by large-scale molecular virus screening of pooled respiratory tract samples [7]. The importance of each viral agent in early life is not clear but RSV, RV, PIV, and influenza virus are predominant in the literature. However, several factors limit our understanding regarding the relative importance of each pathogen, including differences in study design (e.g. PCR versus immunoassay or other detection methods [8]), in recruitment criteria, and in the investigated viruses (e.g. RSV has been considerably easier to detect in-vitro, as compared to RV).\n",

Viral transmission occurs mainly via direct contact or through a fomite, typically with inoculation in the nasal mucosa or the eye conjunctiva, from where it is transported via the lachrymal duct to the nasal cavity; transmission by large particle aerosols is less common and probably less efficient [34]. RVs survive on surfaces and skin for several hours, which allows for easy transmission in the absence of adequate hygiene [35]. In one classic study, viral inoculum to the right conjunctival sac [36] led to positive cultures for RV initially from the nasopharynx and afterwards from the inferior turbinates, where it presumably spread via nose blowing.",

            "text": "About two decades ago it was believed that RV could not infect the lower airways as it grows best at 33 \u00b0C (91.4 \u00b0F), hence virus replication was thought to be reduced at the core temperature found in the lungs [3]. However, we have shown that RV can replicate in lower airway epithelial cells [29], and that the difference in replication capacity at higher temperatures is minimal [37]. This was shown for eight different RV strains whose titers at 37 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F) were significantly higher than those required to initiate infection [37]. This provided conclusive evidence to the infection-related mechanism underlying the epidemiological link between common colds and asthma exacerbations. Up to two-thirds of virus-induced asthma attacks are due to RV, probably as a result of local and systemic immune responses. Local cytopathology in bronchial epithelial cells can only be observed after the use of high viral inocula [29], suggesting a potential dose-response relationship, to which patients with asthma may be particularly susceptible. It is now well recognized that RV is not a strictly upper respiratory pathogen [38], but is in fact one of the most powerful early factors associated with asthma throughout childhood [39]. The dynamics of RV infection are affected in atopic individuals, although it is still not clear to what extent there is increased susceptibility to the virus and/or a differential response to it. In this context we have shown that atopic children with asthma have a higher rate of symptomatic cold and asthmatic episodes than non-atopic children [40, 41].",

Their seasonality and the strong peaks in asthma morbidity in September in temperate climates, shortly after children returning to school, [42] corresponded closely to patterns of RV identification. In the mid-1990s, using the novel, at that time, PCR-based viral diagnostics, viral presence was detected in up to 85% of exacerbations of pediatric asthma, with approximately two-thirds of these associated with RV. Although normal steady-state viral presence\u2014rather than infection\u2014cannot be excluded for some of these cases, it was shown that 60\u201380% of children presenting with asthma exacerbations were positive for viral genetic material versus only 10\u201340% of healthy controls [43, 44]. RV was detected in 65% of cases, coronaviruses in 17%, influenza and para-influenza viruses in 9%, and RSV in 5% [43]. It is now well established that RV is a potent trigger of asthma exacerbations. Reduced interferon responses in asthmatic children are thought to be a potential mechanism underlying RV-induced asthma attacks [21].",

Other birth cohort studies also demonstrate a dose\u2013response relationship between infant RTI severity and asthma risk [49]. Among infants with LRTI, the prevalence of RV was approximately 20\u201330% [50] and RV infection conferred a much higher risk for future asthma development than allergen sensitization or RSV infection alone [51].

There could instead exist mechanisms whereby early-life RV infections might permanently alter lung and immune development and airway physiology. RV infections appear to induce immune responses such as interferon release which can cause malaise and myalgia, neural activation which can promote sneezing/sore throat/cough as well as mediator release from infected cells and leucocytes. RV-infected epithelial cells release a variety of chemokines [21, 55], which promote the recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. In neonatal mouse models, RV infection resulted in prolonged asthma-like responses that were dependent on IL-13 and IL-25 [56, 57]. Furthermore, extracellular matrix collagen deposition was increased in RV-infected, cultured human bronchial ECs. We have shown local induction of proinflammatory mediators by RV infection [29], namely, an increase in mRNA expression and subsequent release of IL-6, IL-8, IL-16 and RANTES, a C-C chemokine with chemoattractant activity for eosinophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes. Produced IL-1 can enhance airway smooth muscle contraction and attenuate smooth muscle dilation responses to bronchodilators [58].",

For treatment of already established infection, intranasal IFN was ineffective [69]. Regarding attachment and entry inhibitors, intranasal Tremacamra (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, CT), a soluble form of ICAM-1 designed to interfere with the attachment of RV on target host cells demonstrated small effects on symptom scores [70]. However, when given more than 12 hours after viral challenge, efficacy was unclear. Regarding capsid binding agents, Pleconaril (WIN63843) was developed and submitted for approval to the U.S. FDA after having succeeded in reducing symptom duration by 1.5 days. However, side effects and presumed drug resistance led the FDA to decline approval in 2002 [71].

Both methods are onerous and slow to produce results, therefore, they are not used in routine clinical work, but do have a role in an epidemiological context [1]. Antigen detection by antigen specific monoclonal antibodies is the basis of a variety of rapid diagnostic tests. However, they demonstrate relatively low sensitivity in adults, where the viral load may be low [78]. Nucleic acid-based tests are increasingly being used and they have opened new avenues in research, especially for RV for which other methods were suboptimal [79]. Also, they are now being multiplexed, allowing the rapid concurrent detection of many viruses including RV, influenza virus, adenovirus, RSV, human metapneumovirus and PIV [8, 80\u201382]. Several rapid antigen tests have also been developed for certain viruses such as IFV [83], and RSV [84]. There are recommendations regarding the use of such tests, especially for influenza, where WHO has produced specific guidelines based on various criteria; e.g. for institutional outbreaks, for travelers, and when surveillance systems indicate that influenza is circulating in the community (\u201cWHO recommendations on the use of rapid testing for influenza diagnosis\u201d). URTIs are not an indication for the use of rapid antigen test in the clinic. Diagnostic tests for viral URTIs are generally not recommended in routine clinical practice unless there are special circumstances (e.g. complications, differential diagnosis issues, immunocompromised individuals etc.). We are currently developing a new chip to detect antibody responses to different RV subtypes in the context of the \u201cPREDICTA\u201d EU project. Such a tool may be able to be used for URTIs in the future. Although the role of radiologic studies in viral URTIs is limited, potential intracranial sequalae should be evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",

It has been used off-label to treat RV and RSV infections in the immunocompromised host and hospitalized infants with severe lower respiratory infection [87], but because of its poor safety profile it\u2019s generally no longer used. For influenza infection of the lower airways Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza), two neuraminidase inhibitors, have been historically used; currently, the former is the main medication used for influenza. They are active against both influenza A and B, and don\u2019t typically induce viral resistance. These agents have replaced the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), M2 channel blockers only active against influenza A, which also caused widespread resistance and are not currently recommended for clinical use [88]. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines for parainfluenza, but various agents are being evaluated in clinical trials (e.g. HPIV3 cp45 [89]). Regarding adenovirus, oral vaccines have been used for decades in USA military training installations [90]. Regarding treatment and/or prevention of RSV infection, several compounds are currently in clinical development: novel oral benzodiazepines, fusion inhibitors, F-protein inhibitors, siRNAs, and others [91, 92]. Furthermore, Palivizumab has reduced RSV hospitalizations by 50% in high-risk infants [93], and Motavizumab, was shown to be more effective [94, 95]. These agents are described in detail in other chapters of this book.",

As opposed to second generation antihistamines which are ineffective, first-generation antihistamines improve rhinorrhea due to their antiholinergic properties, but should not be given to children [101]. In combination with decongestants, they are more effective, but with further compromise of the safety profile of the formulation [102].

Postviral olfactory disorders including parosmia, hyposmia, or anosmia are not frequently seen in children, but can be seen in around 10\u201340% of adult cases, presumably due to the increased impairment of olfaction that is seen with age [108].

Subtle signs can help, however, including the diseases course, as onset of viral pharyngitis may be more gradual and symptoms more often include rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, and hoarseness. Bacterial culture of throat swabs is useful for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis but is not practical for routine use. Rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) are highly specific, and provide an immediate result, thus being often used in routine daily practice.

This is a disease that was historically caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); however the development of the Hib vaccine has altered this trend, and now the rare cases of epiglottitis in an immunized child are mostly due to Haemophilus parainfluenzae, S. aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is a condition caused by bacteria rather than viruses and its detailed description is beyond the scope of this chapter. It is briefly discussed in this section, alongside bacterial tracheitis for purposes of differential diagnosis [135]. This is a condition that can easily escalate to complete airway obstruction. The classic clinical presentation is of a toxic-looking child with severe anxiety and sore throat, soft inspiratory stridor, dysphagia, high fever and drooling. There is usually minimal or no cough. Radiology is not required to set the diagnosis but if undertaken, the inflamed and swollen epiglottis gives the characteristic \u201cthumb\u201d sign [135]. Antibiotics (usually cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) must commence promptly [135]. This condition can be easily told apart from viral coup because of the toxic appearance of the child, the high fever, the lack of cough, and a history of severe sore throat with dysphagia. Bacterial tracheitis, or pseudomembranous croup, is another condition characterized by bacterial inflammation. The tracheal mucosa is infected by Staphyloccocus aureus, streptococci or Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) and the patient appears toxic with a high fever and progressive upper airway obstruction [135]. As opposed to epiglottitis, the characteristic barky cough is prominent and there is typically no drooling. Intravenous antibiotics (typically flucloxacillin and cefotaxime) should be given.",
