As of December 2002, 60 million people had been infected with HIV and one-third of those infected were dead. Further, emerging infectious diseases often have a viral etiology as evidenced by the recent outbreaks of a newly discovered coronavirus that produced Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemics in Asia and North America and of monkeypox in the U.S. Chronic infections with hepatitis B and C viruses and herpes viruses are also significant public health threats and will remain so for the forseeable future. Clearly viral infections remain a significant threat to human health. Thus, considerable efforts are expended to develop vaccines and therapeutics to control both acute and persistent viral infections.",

Genetic polymorphisms in the human population and the dose, strain and route of virus inoculation all contribute to the wide range of clinical outcomes in viral infections. The study of viral pathogenesis, and the preclinical development of viral vaccines and therapeutics, requires the use of animal models. The exquisite specificity of viruses for their cellular receptors and the absolute requirement of viruses for appropriate intracellular machinery defines the host cell tropism of viruses and explains why viruses tend be adapted for infection of particular host species. The relative genetic homology of humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) means that there is considerable conservation of the critical molecules used by viruses in their life cycle. Thus NHPs often are the only species that can be infected with human pathogens. Alternatively, a number of viruses endemic to NHPs are distinct but closely related to human pathogens and are good models for the related human infection. Further, the development, genetics, function and anatomy of the immune system of nonhuman primates and humans are very similar which makes nonhuman primates very useful for understanding human immunity.",

            "text": "Hantavirus (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) infection in humans is associated with two severe and potentially fatal diseases. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is associated primarily with hantaviruses found in Europe and Asia, and is characterized by fever, thrombocytopenia, renal failure and, in severe cases, hemorrhage due to increased capillary permeability (Lee et al., 1982). Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is associated with infection by hantaviruses indigenous to the Americas (e.g. Andes, Muerto Canyon, and Sin Nombre viruses) and is characterized by fever, myalgia, and rapid onset of severe respiratory distress (Nichol et al., 1993). The mortality associated with HPS is 40\u201350% (Lednicky, 2003). The reservoirs of hantaviruses are specific rodent hosts, in which persistent, nonpathogenic infections are common (Lednicky, 2003; Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997). Transmission to humans is by inhalation of aerosolized rodent urine or feces (McElroy et al., 2002). Human to human transmission of hantavirus has been documented only in cases of HPS caused by Andes virus (Padula et al., 1998). No effective hantavirus vaccines have been developed and, while the viruses causing HFRS respond to antiviral therapy with ribivarin, there is currently no effective antiviral drug therapy for HPS (Chapman et al., 1999).",

Experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with Puumala virus produced typical signs of HFRS, including lethargy, anorexia, proteinuria, and/or hematuria, along with cytokine, creatinine, nitric oxide and C-reactive protein responses similar to those of human HFRS (Klingstrom et al., 2002). NHP models have also been used to evaluate candidate hantavirus vaccines. Prototype DNA vaccines, against hantaviruses causing HFRS, have elicited high titer neutralizing antibody in rhesus macaques (Hooper et al., 2001).",

Viremia was detected by RT-PCR in 4 of 6 exposed animals, but none developed clinical signs of HPS. One animal developed a 3-fold decrease in baseline platelet count coincident with high viremia and consistent with thrombocytopenia seen in human HFRS. All animals, however, showed significantly reduced lymphocyte counts, and all developed IgM and IgG antibodies against viral nucleocapsid protein and neutralizing antibody titers (McElroy et al., 2002). Future refinements of primate models should greatly facilitate progress in the treatment and prevention of hantavirus-related diseases.",

            "text": "Ebola virus (family Filoviridae) has been responsible for outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with high mortality in both humans and NHPs (Evans et al., 2003; Walsh et al., 2003). Many species of NHPs are susceptible to experimental infection with Ebola virus, the outcome of which is almost uniformly fatal. The lethality of Ebola virus infection in primates has been used as support for the conclusion that NHPs are not the natural reservoir host of Ebola in nature. The course of Ebola virus infection in NHPs closely follows that observed in infected humans (Baskerville et al., 1978; Johnson et al., 1995; Jaax et al., 1996). As a result, nonhuman primates have been used extensively in studies of Ebola virus pathogenesis (Baskerville, 1978; Johnson et al., 1995; Jaax et al., 1996; Riyabchikova et al., 1999; Ignatiev et al., 2000). Studies in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have demonstrated that lethal Ebola virus infections can occur by oral, conjunctival or aerosol routes of exposure (Jaax et al., 1996; Jahrling et al., 1996; Johnson, E. et al., 1995). Experimental infections, in African green monkeys and baboons, have confirmed that macrophages and monocytes are the first cells to be infected and play a major role in subsequent systemic distribution of virus (Riyabchikova et al., 1999). Experimental studies have also documented the absence of an inflammatory response in Ebola virus-infected NHPs (Baskerville et al., 1978; Jaax et al., 1996), suggesting virus-induced impairment of immune function. Studies in baboons have shown that the severity of Ebola virus-induced coagulopathies is correlated with increases in serum levels of interferon and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (Ignatiev et al., 2000). Interestingly, differences have been observed in Ebola virus pathogenesis in different species of nonhuman primates. Following infection with Ebola-Zaire, baboons developed signs of hemorrhagic disease, while African green monkeys, given the same dose, developed generalized fibrin thrombosis in the absence of overt hemorrhage (Riyabchikova et al., 1999). These findings indicate that species-specific differences need to be considered when selecting a NHP model of Ebola virus infection, and that use of different model systems may be necessary to address the entire spectrum of human disease associated with Ebola virus infection.",

Passive immunization of cynomolgus macaques with hyperimmune globulin alone, or in combination with recombinant interferon-\u03b1, was not protective (Geisbert et al., 2002; Jaax et al., 1996; Jahrling et al., 1996; Jahrling et al., 1999). Similarly, cynomolgus macaques, immunized with liposome-encapsulated irradiated Ebola virus, produced virus-neutralizing antibodies but were not protected against lethal challenge, suggesting that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are required for protection (Rao et al., 2002). Newer approaches to vaccine development have focused on the induction of both cellular and humoral immune responses, incorporating the use of DNA vaccines. A \u201cprime-boost\u201d protocol combining DNA immunization, followed by a boost with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing Ebola viral proteins, induced both cellular and humoral immune responses in cynomolgus macaques. Immunized animals were completely protected from lethal challenge with Ebola-Zaire, indicating that a preventive vaccine against Ebola virus is feasible (Sullivan et al., 2000). This prime-boost protocol, while effective as a preventive vaccine regimen, required more than 6 months to complete, precluding its use in controlling an acute epidemic (Sullivan et al., 2003). Recent studies have demonstrated that immunization of cynomolgus macaques, with recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein, in the absence of DNA priming, resulted in earlier antibody production and induction of Ebola virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Monkeys immunized with only a single dose of this construct and challenged 28 days later were completely protected against both high and low-dose viral challenge (Sullivan et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The disease potential and pathology of respiratory pathogens differs in primates and rodent animal models for two major reasons. First, the anatomy and development of the respiratory system in rodents is significantly different from that in the human or nonhuman primate (Plopper et al., 1992). Second, many viruses that are pathogenic in humans are also pathogenic in another primate species, but not in rodents, mainly due to the need for specific host cell factors for viral replication. Respiratory virus infections of humans have been modeled in a wide range of primates including chimpanzees (Belshe et al., 1977; Hancock et al., 2000; Teng et al., 2000), macaques (Blake and Trask, 1921; Bukreyev et al., 2002; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ponnuraj et al., 2001; Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001; van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Zaucha et al., 2001) and African green monkeys (Durbin et al., 2000; Kakuk et al., 1993). Recently two new viral pathogens, a pneumovirus and a coronavirus, responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, were successfully transmitted to cynomolgus monkeys and this helped to establish the etiology of these newly discovered respiratory tract infections (Fouchier et al., 2003; van den Hoogen et al., 2001).",

The majority of published work is focused on vaccine development. Possibly the best studied example of differing host species pathogenicity, and hence the use of an animal model, is the case of measles virus. Both rodent and primate animal models have been used for measles vaccine research, but wildtype strains of measles virus do not replicate in rodent species, with the exception of cotton rats, so that vaccine-induced protective immunity can be tested only in humans or susceptible nonhuman primates (Putz et al., 2003). Similar restrictions are a concern for animal models of influenza virus (Renegar, 1992; Soike et al., 1984).",

This vaccine-induced immunopathology has been extensively modeled in mice and a Type 2 CD4+ T cell has been found to play a pivotal role (Graham et al., 2002). However, the laboratory mouse is not permissive for measles or respiratory syncytial virus replication and the question of protective versus immunopathologic vaccine immunity can only be addressed in a primate model. Using nonhuman primate models, it has now been shown that hypersensitivity reactions are largely responsible for the enhanced pathology associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection after immunization with formalin-inactivated RSV vaccines (De Swart et al., 2002; Kakuk et al., 1993; Ponnuraj et al., 2001). Studies in macaques have demonstrated a role for immune complexes and eosinophils in the pathogenesis of atypical measles (Polack et al., 1999).",

Experiments in NHP have also determined the temporal relationship between lentiviral replication, after known virus exposure/infection, systemic infection, the development of antiviral immune responses and disease progression. Perhaps most important for vaccine development, NHP studies have compared lentivirus-specific immune responses early after virus exposure, in both vaccinated and unvaccinated animals, to assess potential correlates of vaccine-mediated protection (reviewed in McMichael and Hanke, 2003). The results of these experiments have begun to identify key strategies that could be used for reducing or eliminating HIV transmission from one infected person to another.

Advantages of experimental oral virus inoculation include the ability to use a specific dose of a well-characterized virus inoculum, to vary the total number of virus exposures and the intervals between virus exposures, and to assess how infant development may modulate outcome of virus exposure. Disadvantages are the need for labor-intensive nursery rearing of SIV-exposed infant macaques in specialized BSL-2\ncontainment facilities, increased clinical care, by veterinary staff, of SIV-infected infants and the absence of anti-microbial factors normally present in macaque breast milk, which may more closely mimic conditions found in breast milk of HIV-infected women (Farquhar et al., 2002). Studies using oral inoculation of infant macaques, with SIV or SHIV, have demonstrated that antiretroviral drugs (Van Rompay et al., 2001), HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Baba et al., 2000; Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 2001), and passively acquired SIV-specific, non-neutralizing antibodies (Van Rompay et al., 1998) can prevent infection if given before or, in some cases, soon after virus exposure. Recently, Van Rompay and colleagues (Van Rompay et al., 2003) have shown that active immunization of infant rhesus macaques, with live-attenuated SIV and recombinant poxvirus vectors expressing SIV structural proteins, can protect against high viremia and delay onset of AIDS after oral inoculation with virulent SIV. Collectively, the results of these studies, using the SIV/infant macaque model, suggest that both passive and active immunization strategies may be successful in reducing breast milk transmission of HIV.",

In addition, concordance between MHC class I alleles of HIV-infected women and their infants is associated with increased risk of vertical HIV transmission (Polycarpou et al., 2002). Further, there is evidence that specific human MHC alleles influence both the response to HIV-infection and immunization with HIV vaccines (Kaslow et al., 2001). It has even been proposed that the relatively low genetic variation at MHC class I in chimpanzees is a direct result of long-term selection by an ancient SIV during a devastating pandemic in wild chimpanzees (de Groot et al., 2002).",

This double-blind, placebo controlled human trial, jointly sponsored by the NIH and Vaxgen, found no overall efficacy of a clade B HIV recombinant gp120 protein vaccine in groups at high-risk for HIV exposure in the USA; i.e. there were no statistically significant differences between individuals, receiving placebo or vaccine, in either the proportion of individuals who become HIV-infected, or in viral load after infection (Cohen, 2003a; Cohen, 2003b). This outcome was mirrored in prior NHP efficacy trials of recombinant HIV envelope (gp120 or 160), for chimpanzees challenged with non-homologous laboratory isolates of HIV-1 (Girard et al., 1996), and for macaques immunized with recombinant HIV envelope (gp120 or gp160).

Analyses of the genomes, protein expression and serological cross-relatedness demonstrate that CMV isolates from different NHP species are unique to each host (Davison, A.J. et al., 2003; Eizuru et al., 1989; Gibson, 1983; Hansen et al., 2003; Kilpatrick et al., 1976; Minamishima et al., 1971; Tinghitella et al., 1982).

However, simian CMV replication in vitro is not restricted to cells of the host species. The CMV of African green monkeys (Black et al., 1963) and Rh CMV (Alcendor et al., 1993) can productively infect human and NHP cells in culture. Further, AGMCMV can productively infect rhesus macaques and replicate for years (Swack et al., 1971).

Virtually 100% of monkeys in breeding facilities are seropositive by one year of age and 50% of infants are seropositive by 6 months of age (Vogel et al., 1994). It is likely that multiple strains of CMV are present within each breeding facility (Alcendor et al., 1993). Comparable rates of seroprevalence have been reported in monkeys trapped in the wild (Eizuru et al., 1989; Minamishima et al., 1971; Ohtaki et al., 1986; Swack et al., 1971). The routes of transmission are not known, but it is likely that virus is horizontally transmitted from mother to infant via breast milk and saliva, similar to identified modes in humans. Virus is also normally excreted in urine, adding another route of virus spread. There is no evidence consistent with transmission in utero, although low rates cannot be excluded (Vogel et al., 1994). Maternal-fetal transmission is a critical component of HCMV congenital transmission, and this is one aspect of HCMV natural history that cannot be modeled in NHP at this time. It is most likely that absence of congenital infection, in NHP, has to do with the high seroprevalence of HCMV in breeding age females.",

These characteristics are identical to HCMV. Infected monkeys can remain viuric for years following primary infection, probably for the life of the host (Asher et al., 1974; Swack and Hsiung, 1982). The frequency of CMV shedding is variable between animals, although some monkeys appear to be constantly shedding infectious virus at the oral and genital mucosa. Historically, shedding has been assayed by culturing virus. More recently, sensitive molecular techniques, such as real-time PCR, have been used to detect and quantify CMV DNA purified from mucosal swabs (Huff et al., 2003). Approximately 50% of seropositive monkeys are DNA-positive in mucosal fluids at any one time. Thus, there is active and ongoing virus replication at mucosal surfaces within a persistently infected host. Occasionally, antigen-positive cells can be detected by immunohistochemistry in other tissues, although the tissues are usually histologically normal without an accompanying inflammatory response.",

The acquired immunodeficiency disease, caused by both SRV and SIV, was characterized by persistent lymphadenopathy, severe wasting, chronic diarrhea, high morbidity and mortality and multiple opportunistic infections, including activated CMV. Activated CMV disease is generally characterized by an abundance of cytomegalic cells containing cytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions and often associated with tissue necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration in tissues. This pattern of CMV infection in immunodeficient monkeys is distinct from the paucity of viral inclusions in healthy macaques and is strikingly similar to CMV disease in human AIDS patients. The incidence of CMV disease in monkeys with SAIDS caused by SIV or SRV is variable. Some studies have reported that up to one-third to one-half of CMV seropositive animals have evidence of CMV disease at necropsy (Baskin et al., 1988; Kaur et al., 2003; King et al., 1983; Kuhn et al., 1999; Osborn et al., 1984). Similar to HCMV, activated simian CMV can be observed in multiple tissues, (Baskin, 1987). However, CMV disease is not always systemic and can occur in only a single tissue (Sequar et al., 2002). CMV retinitis, an important clinical problem in some human AIDS patients, has not been described in a SAIDS monkey.",

The kinetics of these changes are variable. If SIV infection occurs during the primary phase of RhCMV infection, the onset of RhCMV disease and SAIDS can be rapid (10\u201327 weeks post SIV). If the monkeys are inoculated with SIV during the persistent phase of RhCMV infection, the time of death can be greatly extended (10 weeks \u2013 >1 year).

BV deservedly bears the most attention of the NHP alphaherpesviruses because of its pathogenic potential in humans. Zoonotic infection of humans with B virus is almost invariably fatal (>70%) in the absence of antiviral chemotherapies, and severe, non-fatal infections can result in encephalomyelitis or severe neurological impairment (Huff and Barry, 2003). BV is the only simian herpesvirus that is known to cause disease in humans. The most salient feature of BV natural history, in terms of its occupational risk, is that an overwhelming majority of macaques shed B virus without overt signs of disease (Huff, J.E. et al., 2003; Weigler et al., 1993; Zwartouw and Boulter, 1984). Thus, every BV-seropositive macaque must be considered as a potential source of infectious BV, whether through its bodily fluids or its tissues.",

The disproportionality between the number of zoonotic infections and the high seroprevalence of BV in breeding age animals is a function of the BV life cycle. The biology of BV infection in macaques is characterized by a lifelong persistence with infrequent, and usually subclinical, shedding at mucosal surfaces. Although the natural history of BV has not been described in detail, the replication cycle of HSV serves as a precedent (Roizman and Sears, 1993). Virus is transmitted across a mucosal surface, such as the oral or genital mucosa. Following localized replication in mucosal epithelial cells, the virus is transmitted directly to sensory nerve endings. The prevailing thought is that there is no associated bloodborne stage of infection, except in rare systemic infections (Simon et al., 1993). The virus particle is carried, by axonal transport, to the dorsal root ganglia where the virus establishes a true latent infection in neurons.",

Periodic reactivation from latency results in the production of progeny virions which transport back down the axon to mucosal epithelial cells, where they replicate and the infectious virus is released from the mucosal epithelium. For BV, most episodes of recurrent viral shedding are asymptomatic (Huff et al., 2003; Weigler et al., 1993; Zwartouw and Boulter, 1984), and represent a constant risk of zoonoses. Clinical signs of either primary or recurrent infection (oral herpetic lesions such as gingivostomatitis, oral and lingual ulcers, and conjunctivitis) are the exception (Carlson et al., 1997; Keeble et al., 1958; Weigler, 1992), and usually require immediate euthanasia of the animal. Virus isolation and molecular detection of BV DNA indicate that the frequency of shedding in a population is low (1\u20135%), although more studies are needed to establish a true rate. There is evidence to suggest that shedding frequency may go up during breeding season (Huff et al., 2003; Weigler et al., 1993).",

HBV, isolated from gibbons and chimpanzees, share an early phylogenetic lineage, indicating that these viruses were indigenous to their respective hosts (Norder et al., 1996). Despite the species specificity of natural HBV isolates, experimental infection of chimpanzees with human and gibbon HBV can be accomplished (Gallagher, 1991). Gibbons can be infected through experimental exposure to human saliva containing HBV (Bancroft et al., 1977; Scott et al., 1980). Replication of human HBV in a number of primate species suggests that natural HBV cross-transmission can occur. HBV can be present in the blood and other body fluids, including saliva/nasopharyngeal fluids, semen, cervical secretions and leukocytes (Alter et al., 1977; Davison, F. et al., 1987). However, HBV transmission from gibbon or chimpanzee to human has never been documented. CD8+ T cells mediate viral clearance during acute HBV infection in chimpanzees (Thimme et al., 2003).",

The chimpanzee is the only experimental animal susceptible to infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The chimpanzee model of HCV infection was instrumental in the initial studies on non-A, non-B hepatitis, including observations on the clinical course of infection, determination of the physical properties of the virus and eventual cloning of the HCV nucleic acid (reviewed in Lanford and Bigger, 2002). Other NHP models of HCV have been developed using surrogate viruses such as GB virus-B (reviewed in Beames et al., 2001). GB virus-B virus is closely related to HCV and it is hepatotropic. In addition, the level of GBV-B viremia observed in infected tamarins, the animal model for GBV-B, is greater than 1000-fold higher than for HCV. Tamarins are much easier to house than chimpanzees and a tissue culture system for GBV-B, using primary tamarin hepatocytes, is available (Beames et al., 2000). Thus, primates are likely to play an important role in developing effective HCV vaccines.",
