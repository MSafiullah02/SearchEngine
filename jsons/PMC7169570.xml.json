            "text": "Respiratory viral or bacterial infections can have profound effects on asthma 1. Viral respiratory infections are found in association with asthma exacerbations 1, 2. The infections associated with these wheezing events are multiple and include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, coronavirus and other viruses as well as typical and atypical bacteria 3. Previous studies have shown differences in the bronchoalveolar cytokine profiles between non\u2010asthmatic and asthmatic patients 4. Several cytokines have been described to play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma, such as IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20104, IL\u20105 and chemokines (MCP\u20101: monocyte chemoattract protein\u20101; RANTES: regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) 2. In this regard, TNF\u2010\u03b1 induces pro\u2010inflammatory events, apoptosis and emphysema in lung tissues 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. IL\u20101 induces releases other cytokines and chemokines and eosinophil accumulation producing neutrophilic inflammation in respiratory disorders 10, 11, 12, 13. In addition, IL\u20101\u03b2 can induce increased production of IL\u20104 and IL\u20105 that increase IgE production 14, 15 involved in allergic airway inflammation 16, 17, 18, 19. MCP\u20101 (monocyte chemoattract protein\u20101) and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) are important in leucocyte recruitment to lung tissues during lung inflammatory events 1, 2, 20, 21. However, circulating cytokine response after viral or bacterial respiratory infections in asthmatic and non\u2010asthmatic status has been little studied. Increased circulating blood levels of several cytokines during viral respiratory tract infection have been reported 2. These cytokines may represent inflammatory markers with different profiles in asthmatic and non\u2010asthmatic patients. In addition to the asthmatic background, the infection type (viral or bacterial) and the site of respiratory infection (upper or lower) could be important to define the circulating cytokine profile. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe changes in the level of several inflammatory (IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1) and Th2 (IL\u20104, IL\u20105) cytokines and chemokines (MCP\u20101 and RANTES) in the systemic circulation during acute viral or bacterial infections in patients with asthmatic or non\u2010asthmatic background and their relationship with the respiratory infection site (upper and lower).",

            "text": "The study population was drawn from outpatient clinics. Male and female patients (n = 43) presenting clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory infection (ARI) were studied (Table 1). The inclusion criteria were those individuals who had at least one respiratory symptom, such as cough, wheeze, running nose or sneeze, and who were suspected by a professional physician to have respiratory infection. Patients with previous diagnosis of asthma according to the criteria of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Program 22, but without asthma manifestation (only asthma background), were selected and classified as asthmatic patients in this study (n = 14). Patients without antecedents of asthma (no asthmatic background) were classified as non\u2010asthmatic patients (n = 29). No patients were treated with antibiotics, anti\u2010allergic or steroid drugs when blood samples were obtained. Patients with asthmatic background did not present asthma manifestations at least one month previous to the moment of blood sample obtaining. Suggestive clinical and X\u2010rays findings were used for the diagnosis of pneumonia (asthmatic: n = 8; non\u2010asthmatic: n = 9) or bronchitis (asthmatic: n = 6; non\u2010asthmatic: n = 20). Pneumonia criteria were as follows: temperature >38 \u00b0C, cough with or without sputum, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, myalgia, dyspnoea, fatigue, rales, rhonchi, wheezing, bronchial breath sounds, dullness to percussion and gastrointestinal symptoms. Regarding chest radiography, the presence of pleural effusion, lobar consolidation or diffuse infiltrates was observed. The physical examination of patients presenting acute bronchitis showed the presence or absence of fever and tachypnea, cough with or without sputum, wheezing, rhonchi and prolonged expiration. Evidence of lung consolidation was absent. Viral (only the presence of studied viruses: asthmatic: n = 5; non\u2010asthmatic: n = 16), bacterial (only the presence of studied bacteria: asthmatic: n = 4; non\u2010asthmatic: n = 7) and mixed (the presence of both studied bacteria and viruses: asthmatic: n = 5; non\u2010asthmatic: n = 6) infection was confirmed by the presence of the agent in specimens from nasopharynx and bronchoalveolar lavage. This study was performed in 43 patients who were obtained from a patient screen (161 patients). Only patients with confirmed presence of studied micro\u2010organisms in both types of samples were selected. Healthy individuals with similar age (15\u201372 years) and sex (n = 10) were studied as controls. Controls were individuals without respiratory symptoms, evidence of lung radiography alterations and negative micro\u2010organism results in bronchoscopy and nasal samples. We excluded individuals who had cardiac disease, immunodeficiency and chronic inflammatory disease. In addition, they were negative for studied micro\u2010organisms and had normal levels of IgE, normal chest radiography and non\u2010asthmatic background. Blood samples were obtained from patients at the time when specimens from nasopharynx and bronchoalveolar were obtained. Serum from controls and patients was stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until use. This work was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. The Ethics Committee of Instituto de Investigaciones Cl\u00ednicas Dr. Am\u00e9rico Negrette and FONACIT (Caracas, Venezuela) approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls prior to blood collection.",

Viral cell infection (respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, influenza A and B and adenovirus) was determined by direct immunofluorescence using a commercial kit (Light Diagnostics SimulFluor Respiratory Screen Kit; Chemicon Internacional, Temecula, CA, USA). Infected and uninfected culture (negative control) slides were incubated with FITC\u2010conjugated antibodies against viral antigens for 1 h; after washing, positive fluorescence in nuclei or nuclei/cytoplasm represented viral infection. Positive antigen control slides provided by commercial assay were used as a positive control. Samples were analysed one time to determine the presence of viruses.",

The complexity of this disease is partly due to the environmental insults such as allergens and microbial infections that play differential roles in the pathogenesis. Microbes may play important roles in the exacerbation of asthma 3. To determine differential circulating cytokine profiles that could be related to the interaction of asthma\u2013microbes, asthmatic and non\u2010asthmatic patients with microbial acute respiratory infection were studied. Patient with and without asthmatic background had similar systemic cytokine response during microbial acute respiratory infection; however, only asthmatic patients had significant increment of chemokines, suggesting a role of asthmatic background in this differential response. As chemokines are important for the recruitment and tissue localization of both immune and structural cells in the lung, they can be relevant in asthma exacerbation 26. During this study, patients with asthmatic background had no clinical manifestation of asthma, suggesting that increased level of chemokines could be an early manifestation of asthma exacerbation.",

Activated T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes, eosinophils and activated mast cells are the characteristic features to make the difference between atopic versus non\u2010atopic asthma 27, 28, 29. However, the pro\u2010inflammatory and Th2 cytokine responses in asthmatic and non\u2010asthmatic patients after lung microbial infection were similar during this study, suggesting that systemic Th2 and pro\u2010inflammatory responses are common aspects of lung infection. The source of increased levels of cytokine/chemokines in the patient's circulation after lung infection could involve lung tissues and/or systemic tissues. The respiratory tract is a frequent primary site of microbial infections resulting in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. During the lung inflammatory events, the alveolar compartmentalization could be lost, allowing the passage of released cytokines to the bloodstream by any other organ to the pulmonary endothelium or inversely from the lung to the bloodstream. Cytokines such as IL\u20101, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20108 have important roles in the lung dysfunction 30. In this study, patients with microbial lung infection had increased serum levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1), Th2 cytokines (IL\u20104 and IL\u20105) and chemokines (MCP\u20101 and RANTES), suggesting a complex immune interaction during microbial respiratory infection. The source of those cytokines may be cells localized in lung tissue. In this regard, epithelial cells, mast cells, basophils, monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes could secrete diverse types of cytokines and chemokines (IL\u20101, TNF, IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL8, MCP\u20101, RANTES) during lung tissue\u2013microbes interactions 21, 31, 32. However, it cannot rule out the role of other cells in other tissues.",

Both RSV and HRV have been most commonly linked to the exacerbation of asthma as well as to the pathogenesis 32. Infection by parainfluenza and influenza viruses has generally been detected in asthma exacerbations 33. The presence of some of those pathogens (RSV, adenovirus, HPIV and influenza) was found in this study; however, they were not associated with clinical manifestations of asthma. Patients with ARI were mainly infected by RSV. This virus is involved in serious lower respiratory tract disease in children and can induce the produce of several cytokines (IL\u20106, IL\u20101, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20108 and GM\u2010CSF), chemokines (IL\u20108, IP\u201010, MCP\u20101 and RANTES) and chemokine receptor expressions in vivo and in vitro\n34, 35, 36. Accordingly, in this study, serum from RSV\u2010infected patients had increased levels of IL\u20101\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20104, IL\u20105, MCP\u20101 and RANTES. As similar serum cytokine/chemokine profile was observed in adenovirus and parainfluencia virus infections, this viral cytokine/chemokine inducer effect probably is a common feature of respiratory virus infection. In addition, infection with RSV could be a risk factor for further lung diseases, as the persistence of cytokines and chemokines in fully recovered RSV\u2010infected patients can provide a substratum for the development of subsequent asthma 37.",

This bacterium is the most common cause of pneumonia in the world 39, 40, that when risk factors weaken the protective immunity, pneumococcus can cause serious diseases 40. Growing evidence indicates that the inflammasome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory diseases. The inflammasome can be activated by Streptococcus pneumonia, inducing the chronic inflammation of the airways of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 41. This could be a mechanism to induce the bacterial cytokine/chemokine production observed in this study. However, cytokines induced by bacterial respiratory infection and type I interferon induced by virus (mixed infection) can be protective for Streptococcus pneumonia infection 42, 43.",

TNF\u2010\u03b1 can induce the activation of several pro\u2010inflammatory events 5, 6, 7, 8 and apoptosis in lung tissues resulting in emphysema 9. IL\u20101 induces neutrophilic inflammatory responses in respiratory disorders 10 and releases other cytokines and chemokines 11, 12. In addition, IL\u20101\u03b2 induces eosinophil accumulation, and it is a Th2 and B cell growth factor 13, properties that could be related to the activation of Th2 profile observed in this study, as shown by the increased production of IL\u20104 and IL\u20105. These cytokines stimulate B\u2010lymphocytes to produce IgE 14, 15 and increase allergic airway inflammation 16, 17, 18. Increased levels of circulating chemokines found in asthmatic patients could reflect lung chemokine production that may be important in leucocyte recruitment to lung tissues. RANTES is involved in the chemoattraction of eosinophils, monocytes and T\u2010lymphocytes, and therefore, it has high relevance in asthma 21. MCP\u20101 is involved in the recruitment of regulatory and effector leucocytes (monocytes, lymphocytes and basophils) into tissues 20. Therefore, chemokines could play an important role in asthma pathogenesis and in ARI. In addition, the increased systemic concentration of those cytokines/chemokines could activate circulating leucocytes with further deleterious effects in the lung 1, 2.",
