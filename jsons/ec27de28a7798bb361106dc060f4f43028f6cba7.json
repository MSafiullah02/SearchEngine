(IPF), acute exacerbation (AE) has been increasingly recognized as an acute, often fatal, clinical incident, which occurs during the course of this disease. 1e6 Much effort has been devoted to characterize this condition, and most recently the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Clinical Research Network (IPF net) have proposed a definition and criteria for AE of IPF. 6 In IPF, AE is characterized by rapid worsening of respiratory symptoms, acute deterioration of hypoxemia, newly developed bilateral ground-glass opacity and/or consolidation on chest radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans, and the absence of other alternative causes, such as infection, heart failure and embolism. 5, 6 Histologically, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is superimposed on the underlying fibrotic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) in most patients with AE of IPF. 1, 2, 7, 8 Recently, AE has also been shown to occur in interstitial pneumonias other than IPF, such as idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and collagen vascular diseaseassociated interstitial pneumonia (CVD-IP). 9e14 Parambil et al. have reported AE in three of 18 patients with

Typically, 9 Collectively, these results confirmed that CVD-IP patients can develop AE. The incidence of AE in IPF remains unknown. The reported incidence varies widely, because there are differences in the definition of AE, as well as differences in the populations studied. However, several prospective randomized control or retrospective longitudinal cohort studies have reported the likely incidence. Kim et al. indicated a 1-year incidence of 8.5% in a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 147 patients with biopsy-proven IPF. 4 In a randomized controlled trial of pirfenidone, Azuma et al. reported a 9-month incidence of 14.3% in 36 placebotreated patients. 24 Taken together, the incidence of AE of IPF was estimated to be in the range of 5e19% per year. 5 In CVD-IP, the present study revealed an overall incidence of 7.2%, with a mean 6.0 years follow-up, and a 1-year incidence of 1.25%. Compared with the reported incidence of AE of IPF, the incidence of CVD-IP appears to be lower. Among the underlying CVD, AE was found exclusively in patients with RA and pSS. Five of our six CVD-IP patients with AE had RA (overall incidence, 20.0%; 1-year incidence, 2.58%), and the other patient had pSS. Consistent with our observations, Park et al. described four CVD-IP patients who developed AE, and found that most of them (75%) had RA, 13 although they did not mention the overall number for each CVD-IP. Collectively, these data suggest that patients with CVD-IP develop AE less frequently than those with IPF, and among CVD-IP, this condition is most common in RA. Histologically, three of our six CVD-IP patients with AE had a UIP pattern on surgical lung biopsy, and two had an NSIP pattern, and the other had unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia. Originally, AE was reported to occur in UIP, but recent studies have described this condition in interstitial pneumonia with patterns other than UIP, such as the NSIP pattern. 10e14 So far, there are few data about the histology of AE in CVD-IP. Parambil et al. have recently shown that acute respiratory deterioration in CVD-IP represented DAD pattern on the underlying chronic fibrotic processes, such as UIP and NSIP. 9 As a result of severe respiratory failure, the second surgical lung biopsy at the onset of AE could not be performed in our patients, but an autopsy of one patient with NSIP revealed a DAD pattern superimposed on a background of an NSIP pattern (Fig. 3) . Collectively, these results suggest that AE occurs in either UIP or NSIP patterns of CVD-IP. Radiological findings of our CVD-IP patients were comparable to those of AE in IPF, as described previously. 6, 14, 25 We found new, extensive ground-glass opacity mostly with patchy air space consolidation, superimposed on background reticular abnormality. In laboratory findings, in addition to severe hypoxemia, marked elevations of serum CRP and LDH levels were observed. Interestingly, the serum levels of KL-6, a marker of interstitial pneumonia, were strikingly increased in all patients tested at the onset of AE. Similarly, in IPF, the serum levels of KL-6 were shown to be elevated at AE, which suggests that this can be used as a marker of this condition. 26 A few data are available on BAL findings of AE, and neutrophilia in BAL fluid has been reported. 2, 4, 8 We performed BAL in only one patient, and marked neutrophilia was noted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 291, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 811, "end": 812, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 944, "end": 946, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1043, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2460, "end": 2461, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2920, "end": 2922, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2923, "end": 2926, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2929, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3478, "end": 3480, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3578, "end": 3580, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3581, "end": 3583, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3584, "end": 3585, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2707, "end": 2715, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Little is known about the causative factors of AE of IPF.
