Gender differences in the perception of signs and symptoms of minor illness were examined on data from the MRC Common Cold Unit. Volunteers assessed the presence and severity of colds at the end of their stay in the Unit, using the same two measures as a trained clinical observer (all ratings were double blind). Even after adjustment for other variables, men were significantly more likely to 'over-rate' their symptoms in comparison with the clinical observer than were women.

One of the explanations frequently proffered for the female excess in rates of illness and health care use is that females may be more sensitive to bodily discomforts and more willing to report symptoms of distress and illness than are men [6, 7, 8] . Sex differences in the way symptoms are perceived, evaluated and acted upon are thought to result from childhood socialisation as well as adult role expectations and obligations [9, 10, 111. There are methodological difficulties in testing the hypothesis that women are more likely to perceive and report bodily discomfort than men. The most obvious is that in the absence of any 'direct' or 'objective' measure of discomfort, there is no way of choosing between two competing explanations for greater reported incidence of symptoms among women-namely that the incidence is 'really' higher (whether for social or biological reasons) or that women have a lower threshold for perceiving and reporting symptoms. An interesting study of gender differences in the experience of headache, for example, found significant gender differences in perceived pain associated with headaches, in the reported duration and frequency of attacks, and in utilisation of medical care in the month before interview. It was unable, however, to answer the question: \"whether gender-related headache differences are due to biology or explained by socially de&red roles (and behaviour)\" [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 248, "text": "[l-5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 491, "end": 494, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 495, "end": 497, "text": "7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 498, "end": 500, "text": "8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 685, "end": 693, "text": "10, 111.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1669, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Mechanic has pointed to other problems of research on this topic. One is that even if one can compare people's self-perceptions of their symptoms with a standard&d examination by a physician, it could well be that the latter would itself be influenced by the sex of the person whose. health is being assessed. Another is that there is likely to be a great variability in men's and women's responses depending on the condition or symptoms being examined, yet most investigations look at aggregate indices of physical or mental illness rather than at specific conditions [lo] .

Differences in patient delay persisted with adjustment for age, education, and barriers to seeking care.

The author suggests that the findings are more consistent with the \"view that reports of symptoms in interview surveys are contingent upon the type of condition and specific experience associated with a particular morbidity, or set of symptoms, than they are with views suggesting a selective tendency either for women systematically to report more symptoms or for men to be inhibited in reporting symptoms\" [14, p. 3061 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 823, "end": 835, "text": "[14, p. 3061", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Thus studies focussing on specific conditions, and those for which there is some degree of objective validation by clinical or X-ray evidence, have not found support for the hypothesis that women are more likely than men to perceive and report symptoms.

Scores for each recorded symptom or sign (e.g. sore throat, fever, swollen glands) were added to produce a total overall score for each volunteer at the end of the trial. In addition to this numerical clinical score, each volunteer was also given a 'clinical grade', based on the clinical observer's overall assessment at the end of the trial. The following grades were used: no cold; very mild or doubtful cold; mild; moderate; and severe. There is an overall correlation, but no formal relationship, between clinical grade and clinical score; that is, the 5 category clinical grade was not designed to map precisely onto the numerical clinical score [15, 161 . The viruses used during the period under study included rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses and other viruses. Strictly speaking the signs and symptoms reported should be described as referring to 'illness' rather than 'colds', but the term cold is used as a shorthand to cover all the illnesses described.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "161", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DESIGN AND METHODS"}, {"text": "For the purpose of this self-assessment study a special form was designed on which volunteers were asked to indicate their own assessment of the clinical grade of their symptoms, using the same 5 categories, from no cold to severe, as the clinical observer.

They were also asked to mark on a 10 cm horizontal line where they thought their cold symptoms were in relation to the polar anchor points \"no cold at all\" and \"the worst cold I could imagine\". This analogue scale [17] could be compared with the numerical clinical score used by the clinical observer. The clinical grade and clinical score were assessed by both volunteer and doctor at the end of the 10 day trial, i.e. all assessments were made at the same time. Self and observer-assessments were made independently (i.e. \"blind\" of each other). Since the clinical grade categories and criteria are identical for the volunteers and the clinical observer, whereas the clinical score and the analogue scale are not identical, the analysis presented in this paper mainly concentrates on the clinical grade. Volunteers were also asked to record their age, sex, occupation and marital status since the literature on self-assessments suggests variation by such socio-demographic characteristics.

Using their own occupations, 51.8% were in non-manual social classes, 18.2% in manual social classes, and 29.6% were homemakers or students. The sample is thus unrepresentative of the general population, with young, female, unmarried, and higher social class or unoccupied people being over-represented. These characteristics stem from the nature of participation in the Unit's research programme, with volunteers having to be prepared to stay at the Unit for 10 days.

I shall continue with this usage in this paper although I shall return to a discussion of its utility later. Table 1 shows the relationship between the selfassessed and observer-assessed clinical grade, with the 'moderate' and 'severe' categories grouped because the latter contained so few cases. There is a high level of association between the self and observer assessments (x2 = 1873.3, df= 9, P c 0.0001). The statistic of choice for assessing agreement between observers using ordinal scales is kappa or weighted kappa [20, 21] . Both scores can range from -1 (indicating complete disagreement) to + 1 (indicating complete agreement), with 0 representing the amount of agreement to be expected by chance. Weighted kappa takes account of the distance of cells from the diagonal, weighting those further from the diagonal to indicate more disagreement than those nearer the diagonal. Both kappa and weighted kappa (calculated by the weighting scheme recommend by Fleiss and Cohen [21] ), show a high level of agreement between the self and observer assessments (& = 0.888, SE = 0.026, Z = 34.15, P < 0.001).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 518, "end": 522, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1058, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 634, "end": 641, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "DESIGN AND METHODS"}, {"text": "According to the clinical observer, females were significantly more likely than men to get a cold while they were at the Unit = 41.2% compared with 35.6% (x2= 5.22, df= 3, P < 0.05).

The similarity of the findings from studies pertaining to conditions differing in prognosis, severity and chronicity gives added support to a hypothesis contrary to that normally suggested; namely that at given levels of clinical signs of a condition, men and women are either equally likely to report related symptoms, or men are likely to report more severe symptoms.
