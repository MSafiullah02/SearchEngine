            "text": "Many viruses can spread to the brain through the neural (peripheral or olfactory) or hematogenous route (figure 1). Poliovirus, rabies virus and \u03b1-herpesviruses, for example, invade at axon or sensory terminals and spread to the neurons. Many viruses able to spread via peripheral nerves can also enter the brain through the olfactory route. Neuronal spread and replication are characteristics of these viruses and define their pathogeneses. Other viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), measles virus, arenavirus and mumps virus, can invade the central nervous system (CNS) by the hematogenous route via the blood\u2013brain barrier or microvascular endothelial cells. Such viruses can also replicate in resident cells within the brain. Some viruses that normally invade other tissues (e.g. influenza virus and reovirus) can enter the brain via the hematogenous route, although invasion of the CNS is a less frequent diversion from their normal mode of replication (in, for example, epithelial cells, lymphocytes or monocytes). Many viruses successfully infect brain cells and complete their life cycle in the CNS. Interestingly, in spite of significant differences among viruses in their modes of replication, as well as in the brain regions or neural cell types that they infect, most can establish a latent or persistent infection that could be essential for the induction of the unique pathogenesis of each virus [4].",

Sickness behavior is recognized as part of the natural homeostatic reaction of the host during an infectious episode, and can include alterations in body weight, temperature, taste preference, food and water intake, and sleep patterns 5, 6. Although sickness behavior is generally believed to be triggered by proinflammatory cytokines, viruses might also play a direct role in the generation of sickness behavior. Borna disease virus (BDV) infection in neonatal rats induces body weight stunting and abnormal salt taste preference [7]. In addition, certain strains of mice infected with influenza virus show decreases in food and water intake, and body weight, as well as a reduced body temperature [8]. Although viral infection is normally associated with a reduction in body weight, a persistence of BDV or canine distemper virus is reported to induce an obesity syndrome. Of BDV-infected adult rats, 5\u201310% became obese, resulting in a body weight that is up to 300% that of normal rats [9]. Alteration of sleep pattern was also observed in adult mice and cats infected with influenza virus and feline immunodeficiency virus, respectively 10, 11.",

Locomotor activity tests have been used to find anxiety-like and exploratory responses in infected animals. Because rodents are neophobic and averse to bright light, the animals tend to avoid open spaces and stay close to the walls when they are placed in a novel, well-lit open field. The tests measure behavior induced by anxiety, and also exploratory processes that might be affected by multiple CNS dysfunctions. Locomotor abnormalities were reported in rodents inoculated with one of several viruses, including BDV, influenza virus, murine leukemia virus (MLV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and also in non-human primates with BDV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 12, 13. Neonatally BDV-infected Lewis rats show an extreme locomotor hyperactivity [14]. The study of species-specific fear-related responses suggests that the locomotor hyperactivity in BDV-infected rats reflects increased, rather than decreased levels of anxiety, and is the result of increased escape responses to aversive stimuli [14].",

However, the mechanisms underlying these neuronal disturbances might fall into two general categories, involving direct and indirect pathways. Direct pathways include neural cell injury induced by the direct actions of virus replication or its components, as well as by the functional interplay between host and virus factors in an infected cell. Alternatively, indirect pathways involve a wide range of brain cell damage via neuroenvironmental alterations caused by viral infection.

It has been suggested that HSV-1 can induce host cell apoptosis before initiation of the host cellular immune response. Another well studied mechanism of the direct pathway involves BDV infection. In rodent models of BDV infection, the virus can cause neuronal cell dysfunctions in the absence of immune-mediated cell destruction or apoptosis, resulting in serious neurological disorders [23]. In addition, many viruses use one or more mechanisms to regulate the cell defense responses that are necessary for survival or functional stabilization of the neural cells being infected 24, 25. Such mechanisms include the inhibition or suppression of double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase, caspase activation, death receptors and proapoptotic activation of transcription factors, such as p53. Perturbation of such cellular factors could induce functional loss and/or abnormal activation of infected neural cells, leading to broad incoordination of the neural system.",

Indirect mechanisms involve the effects of such CNS alterations caused by host responses to infection. The host immune responses exist as a dominant indirect pathway to affect both infected and uninfected cells. Although T-cell responses elicited during infection can eliminate viruses efficiently without the destruction of infected neurons [26], infiltrated T cells can actually induce neuronal damage. In BDV-infected rodents, CD8+T cells are believed to play a major role in the immunopathogenesis of this virus. Administration of anti-CD8 antibodies to BDV-infected rats not only inhibits brain inflammation, but also prevents neuronal degeneration [27]. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, in infected brain also have deleterious effects on neuronal functions. In addition, host autoimmune responses induced by viral infections are also present as an indirect pathway of virus-induced neuropathogenesis. It has been suggested that multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease, is initiated by persistent viral infection [28]. MS-like demyelination is induced in rodent brains infected with certain neurotropic viruses, such as Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, murine coronavirus and Semliki Forest virus [28]. Perhaps the most thoroughly studied indirect mechanism is excitotoxicity, which involves abnormal stimulation or activation of neurons by the amino acid glutamate, and appears to play a role in HIV-associated neuronal injury [29]. HIV envelope protein gp120 or Tat, as well as the inflammatory mediator TNF-\u03b1, act via glutamate receptor pathways to increase oxidative stress in neurons and cause neuronal cell death [30]. Such indirect pathways might play a role in the development or aggravation of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.",

The cytokines are known to activate rapidly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, although IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are less potent and effective than is IL-1. This activation might be mediated by the systematic regulation of cyclooxygenase, norepinephrine, 5-HT and brain tryptophan [38]. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis is a prominent biochemical change observed in patients with major depression [39]. That antidepressants directly regulate HPA axis function suggests that hyperactivity of the HPA axis is involved in the pathogenesis of depressive behaviors [40]. One current hypothesis proposes that activation of the HPA axis upregulates cortisol (a human glucocorticoid), the release of which is stimulated by adrenocorticotropin from the anterior pituitary, as well as by increased levels of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus [39]. Both glucocorticoids and CRF are suggested to have multiple and complex effects on the circulating neurotransmitters, including 5-HT, dopamine and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid).",

Glial cells, particularly astrocytes, are a primary source of neurotrophins and growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor. In addition, glial cells release neurotoxins following stimulation by IL-1 [42]. The contribution of proinflammatory cytokines to neuronal degeneration is believed to be dependent on the balance between neuroprotective and neurotoxic factors released from glial cells 41, 43. In virus-infected brains, a chronic upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines might tip the balance in favor of neurotoxic effects. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines might induce apoptosis in CNS cells. Although the role of IL-1 in the induction of apoptosis is less clear, it is well known that TNF-\u03b1 can directly induce apoptosis via activation of Fas receptors in neuronal cells [44].",

Alteration of 5-HT receptors in the brain is observed in some viral infections. Semliki Forest viral infection increases the number of 5-HT1A receptors by up to 80% in the cortex but has no effect in the midbrain, pons and the hypothalamus, whereas there is no alteration in 5-HT2A receptor numbers in any of the brain regions [50]. Rabies viral infection in humans induces a series of clinical symptoms, suggesting involvement of the central 5-HT system. Studies using mouse models have suggested that 5-HT1D-like receptor subtypes are affected specifically and at an early stage following rabies viral infection [51]. Neonatal BDV infection induces upregulation of hippocampal 5-HT1A and cortical 5-HT2A receptors in Lewis rats and downregulation of cortical 5-HT2A receptors in Fisher344 rats [52]. It has recently been reported that transgenic mice synthesizing BDV phosphoprotein in glial cells exhibit an unbalanced expression of 5-HT receptors (1A, 1B and 2C) in the hippocampus at eight months of age [3].

Neurodegenerative disorders are typically accompanied by glial proliferation, which involves the release of various neurotoxic factors. However, in major psychiatric disorders, the brain shows no signs of glial proliferation, and a spectrum of neurological abnormalities associated with glial cell dysfunction are frequently found 53, 54, 55. This observation gives rise to the hypothesis that neurological abnormalities associated with glial cell dysfunction contribute to the development of schizophrenia 54, 55. In fact, recent efforts to identify candidate genes that confer susceptibility to schizophrenia have revealed some genes whose functions might be linked to glial cell function or survival 56, 57.",

Furthermore, recent evidence has revealed that astrocytes might be required for synapse formation, maintenance and efficacy, as well as for the maintenance of brain homeostasis 58, 59. The long processes of astrocytes associate with the synaptic connections of neurons and participate in neuronal signaling, as a third element within the synapse. Astrocytes increase the number of structurally mature synapses in the CNS, as well as their function, and most synapses are generated synchronously with the development of glial cells [60]. It is most likely, therefore, that a reduction in astrocyte function causes a wide range of disturbances in brain development, as well as in synapses and neurons, leading to serious behavioral abnormalities (figure 2).",

            "text": "Many viruses can infect and subsequently activate glial cells. Several neurotoxic or immunomodulatory factors are released from activated glial cells, leading to altered neuronal function and eventual neuronal apoptosis, as described above. This process appears to be a common pathway leading to virus-induced neuronal injury, which is frequently accompanied by glial proliferation [61]. By contrast, this pathway seems to be unconnected to the neuropathology of major psychiatric disorders. Thus, the presence of virus that leads to a long-lasting persistent infection and induces glial cell dysfunctions without the destructions of neural cells might be key to understanding the linkage between CNS viral infection and neuropsychiatric disorders (figure 2). Recently, it has been demonstrated that glial expression of BDV phosphoprotein leads to behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities in transgenic mice without the loss of any types of glial cell [3]. The transgenic mice developed enhanced intermale aggressiveness, hyperactivity and spatial reference memory deficit. It was also shown that the brains of the transgenic mice exhibit a significant reduction in BDNF and 5-HT receptor expression, as well as a marked decrease in synaptic density [3]. Although the mechanism by which glial expression of BDV phosphoprotein induces neurological disturbances remains to be elucidated, the lack of reactive astrocytosis or neural cell loss in the transgenic brains suggests that phosphoprotein can directly affect astrocyte function. BDV phosphoprotein interferes with a multifunctional protein, amphoterin/HMGB1, and inhibits its function in cultured neuronal cells [62]. HMGB1 plays an important role not only in neurite outgrowth of neurons, but also in cell survival through the interaction with its cellular receptor, RAGE [63]. HMGB1 is crucial for neuron\u2013glial cell interaction, which is correlated with diminished HMGB1 levels in glial cells [64]. These findings suggest that HMGB1 function is very important in the maintenance of astrocyte function, as well as of CNS homeostasis. BDV frequently establishes a persistent infection without immune-mediated brain damage in animal brains, and phosphoprotein is abundantly produced, even in the persistent state [23]. The possible relationship between glial cell dysfunction by persistent viral infection and virus-induced neurobehavioral disorders should be investigated further.",

Numerous genetic and neurophysiological studies have demonstrated that abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems and glial cell function, as well as the release of proinflammatory cytokines, play crucial roles in the induction of behavioral disorders. Such abnormalities have also been observed in a wide variety of CNS viral infections. Does a specific virus cause psychiatric disorders in humans? Although frequently asked, there is currently no direct evidence that viral infection results in human mental illnesses. CNS viral infection in animals can induce neurochemical and neurophysiological abnormalities, as well as behavioral alterations, linked to human mental illnesses. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have demonstrated that people with behavioral diseases have a high prevalence for antibodies to certain viruses, such as BDV, herpesviruses and endogenous retrovirus, compared with controls 65, 66, 67, 68. However, such linkages might not be a direct answer. Given that most neuropsychiatric disorders are multifactorial, much more will be required to determine the role of viral infection among the many interlinked risk elements. A better understanding of the effects of chronic or persistent viral infection of CNS cells, particularly glial cells, should lead to novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurobehavioral disorders.",
