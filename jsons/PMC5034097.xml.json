To investigate the role of LPMs in the poultry-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses, a sustained LPM surveillance program was established in Shenzhen. Two human cases were detected shortly after the identification of H5N6 viruses in LPMs in Shenzhen in December 2015 and January 2016, and the potential linkage between human infection and the viruses in the LPMs was analyzed. Our study verified that sustained LPM surveillance could be an effective system for providing early warning about human infections with the avian influenza virus.",

From December 2015 to January 2016, we extended the monthly surveillance to all ten districts in Shenzhen by including the other eight districts of Longhuaxin, Futian, Guangming, Luohu, Pingshan, Dapeng, Bao'an and Yantian. There were no restrictions on the numbers or locations of the LPMs surveilled in each district. During each monthly sampling of each district, 10\u201320 environmental samples were collected from the same or different LPMs during this study period. The environmental samples included poultry feces, drinking water, sewage and swabs from poultry cages, feathers and poultry processing tools.

Intensive LPM surveillance was conducted by collecting environmental samples from all 10 districts from December 2015 to January 2016. Before December, a total of 120 environmental samples were collected in selected LPMs in LG and NS districts. Positive samples were only detected in LG district. There were 34 out of 60 samples positive for FluA, but the avian influenza virus subtypes H5N6, H7N9 and H10N8 were not detected, with the exception of the H9N2 virus, which exhibited a positive rate of 25% (95% confidence interval (CI) 20%\u201330% Supplementary Table S3). The virus was continually detected in all 10 districts beginning in December 2015 (December: 34.5%, 95% CI: 21%\u201348%, January: 53, 95% CI: 33%\u201373%) but the subtype H7N9 and H10N8 viruses were still not detected in any of the LPMs in our study area. Notably, considerable increases in the H5N6 RT-PCR-positive rate (December: 29%, 95% CI: 14%\u201344%, January: 19%, 95% CI: 3%\u201335%) were observed beginning in December 2015 in all 10 districts (Supplementary Table S3 and Figure 1), which suggested that the H5N6 virus had circulated widely in LPMs in Shenzhen and posed a high risk for potential human infection during this period. Meanwhile, two human H5N6 virus infection cases were detected between late December and early January in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, during the period of the increased H5N6 virus-positive rates in the LPMs (Figure 1). We proposed that sustained surveillance in LPMs may show some evidence that the risk of human infection might increase along with the increased activity of H5N6 virus in LPMs. The incidence of two new cases infected with H5N6 virus might be avoidable assuming that some interventions such as LPMs closures were implemented when the virus were widely detected via our surveillance.",

Three environmental viruses, that is, A/Environment/Shenzhen/1/2015 (H5N6) (Env1), A/Environment/Shenzhen/2/2015 (H5N6) (Env2) and A/Environment/Shenzhen/3/2015 (H5N6) (Env3), were isolated from environmental samples collected during our routine LPM surveillance in early December 2015. SZ16 shared the highest nucleotide identity (99.4-99.9%) with Env1 and Env2, and the identities between SZ15 and these two environmental isolates ranged from 96.7 to 99.3%. However, Env3 exhibited greater divergences with the other H5N6 viruses in this study (83.9\u201397.5%). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that SZ15 and SZ16 were reassortant viruses between the H5 of clade 2.3.4.4, H6N6 of Eurasian lineage and H9N2/H7N9 viruses (Figure 2). The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase genes of all five H5N6 viruses identified in Shenzhen were located in the same lineage of A/Guangzhou/39715/2014 (GZ39715, H5N6; Figure 3). However, all six internal genes of SZ15 and SZ16 clustered with the H9N2 or H7N9 viruses that were circulating in poultry, whereas the internal genes of GZ39715 belonged to H5N1 (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S1). The polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (MP) and non-structural protein (NS) genes of Env3 were located in the H5 linage, which was similar to GZ39715 (Supplementary Figure S1). The PB2 gene was located in a different sub-lineage with the H5N6, H6N6 and H6N2 viruses from birds (Figure 4). These results demonstrated the genetic diversity of the HPAI H5N6 viruses circulating in the LPMs. The high sequence identities of the viruses from the patients and the LPMs further confirmed the linkage between the human infections and LPM exposure. Multiple basic amino acids were present at the cleavage site between HA1 and HA2, which indicated that these viruses were highly pathogenic in chickens (Table 1). Mutations (S123P, I151T and T156A; H5 numbering) in HA related to an enhanced human-like receptor binding ability were detected in the human and environmental viruses (Table 1). The I368V mutation at PB1, which has been reported to be associated with increased transmissibility in ferrets, was detected in the present study. The amino acid lengths of PB1-F2 in the human and two of the environmental H5N6 isolates were longer than those of previously reported human H5N6 viruses, which indicated the pathogenicity of these viruses in mice. The C-terminal truncations of NS1 partially or completely removed its C-terminal tail, which contains features that might be involved in the biological activities of NS1. These features include the PDZ-binding motif, which is composed of NS1's four C-terminal residues and generally consists of the motif 227ESEV230 in the NS1 of avian influenza viruses.20 The avian C-terminal ESEV motif of NS1 increases virulence in mice,21 but truncations were detected in all of the isolates in this study. All isolates were resistant to adamantane derivatives but were susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors. However, the PB2 E627K mutation that is associated with an increased adaptation and virulence in mammals was detected only in SZ16.",

In our study, no H5N6 virus was detected in the LPMs in Shenzhen prior to December 2015. However, markedly increased H5N6 virus frequencies in the LPMs were detected in all of the sampling sites distributed across the entire city beginning in December 2015. Two human cases of H5N6 virus infection were detected coincident with the increase in viral activity, and the epidemiological and genetic investigation results confirmed that the human infections were associated with LPM exposure. These results suggest that sustained surveillance of LPMs could serve as an effective early warning that could provide the opportunity to conduct interventions before the emergence of human infections with zoonotic avian influenza viruses.",

These findings suggest that the H9N2 virus might be the key contributor to the genesis of novel virus genotypes in poultry.31 One possible reason could be the wide circulation of the H9N2 virus in LPMs, which is supported by the results of our surveillance that revealed increases in the H9N2 virus-positive rates that ranged from 25% (95% CI: 20%\u201330%) to 53% (95% CI: 33%\u201373%) from June 2015 to January 2016 (Supplementary Table S3). Another reason that H9N2 viruses might contribute to novel genotypes is the high genetic compatibility of H9N2 viruses observed in previous studies that have indicated that the internal genes of H9N2 viruses increase replication and transmissibility in animals.32, 33 Moreover, some mammalian adaptation mutations have also been detected in the internal genes of H9N2. In addition, mutations (S123P, I151T, and T156A) associated with enhanced human receptor binding ability were found in HA of the H5N6 viruses in this study. Thus, the H5N6 viruses presented here might be associated with a greater risk of human infection.",
