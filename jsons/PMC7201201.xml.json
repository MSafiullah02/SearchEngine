Reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infections is often centered on barrier contraceptives (1). While barrier contraceptives reduce the risk of HIV-1 sexual transmission and, presumably, that of other STIs, they are not 100% effective (2, 3). In addition, many STIs may be asymptomatic, causing significant systemic and reproductive health problems prior to diagnosis or initiation of treatment (4). Therefore, preventative approaches for STI that do not interfere with sexual norms are critically needed to curtail the estimated 340 million newly acquired STIs each year (5).",

Rhesus macaque studies showed that GML was safe, and epithelial integrity was observed during long-term vaginal use (13). Further, GML was not disruptive of the normal Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota important to maintaining vaginal pH and did not induce inflammation (13). In vitro studies showed that GML reduces T cell proliferation and activation following stimulation by T cell receptor (TCR) agonists, reducing the production of TCR-induced cytokines (14).",

GML also inhibits growth of vaginal bacteria that increase susceptibility to HIV-1 and other STIs (9, 15). The protective properties of GML with respect to the vaginal mucosa and inhibitory effects on cytokine production suggest that GML may confer protection during HIV-1 transmission, as immune activation and inflammation increase susceptibility to HIV-1 (13). Previous in vivo macaque studies of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaginal transmission confirmed that GML protected subjects from acute and systemic high-dose intravaginal SIV infection (16, 17). GML also reduced HIV-1-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, MIP-3\u03b1, and interleukin-8 (IL-8), further supporting the hypothesis of an immunoregulatory effect during infection (16).",

Previous studies showed that monoglycerides that are similar to GML inactivate enveloped RNA and DNA viruses (18\u201322). Although the mechanism of action is not well characterized, electron microscopy (EM) of VSV treated with linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, revealed disruption of the viral envelope and of particle integrity (19, 20). Similar EM results were obtained from treatment of influenza A virus and coronavirus (CoV) infections with a monolaurin mixture (22). Other studies showed that phage treated with a monoglyceride had altered sedimentation in sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments (21). These results suggest that the viral envelope may be critical for inactivation (19\u201321). Here, we examined how GML restricts HIV-1 and additional human-pathogenic virus infections in vitro. We show that GML does not interfere with CD4 receptor binding but prevents HIV-1 CXCR4 coreceptor binding. Consistent with previous studies, GML also inhibited enveloped viruses, including mumps virus, yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus, but did not interfere with viral replication of nonenveloped viruses. In YFV infection, promoting envelope maturation reduces sensitivity to GML, consistent with previous findings suggesting that the viral envelope is sensitive to GML inactivation. GML is structurally related to reutericyclin, a compound secreted by Lactobacillus. Reutericyclin inhibits a range of bacterial pathogens (24), and Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microenvironments are protective against heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. Our data suggest that reutericyclin produced by Lactobacillus may contribute to protection against heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 (25, 26).",

Here, we examined the kinetics of GML with respect to effects on HIV-1 replication in vitro. TZM-bl cells were used as these are a HeLa cell derivative engineered to express high levels of HIV-1 receptor and coreceptor (CD4 and CXCR4, respectively) and contain \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase regulated by the HIV-1 LTR promoter to quantitate infection (27\u201329). Addition of GML to cells at the time of HIV-1 inoculation significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication at all concentrations of GML tested (Fig. 1A). Although high (>40 \u03bcg/ml) concentrations of GML reduced cell viability, HIV-1 was also inhibited at noncytotoxic (\u226440 \u03bcg/ml) concentrations of GML (Fig. 1A). We confirmed this observation in a Jurkat CD4+ T cell line (see Fig. S1A to C in the supplemental material).",

Addition of GML to cells for 24 h prior to infection, washing the cells, and incubation with HIV-1 plus GML showed similar levels of HIV-1 inhibition; however, cellular toxicity was increased by approximately 2-fold (to <40 \u03bcg/ml) by the prolonged exposure of cells to GML (Fig. 1B). Cells incubated in GML for 24 h but washed prior to HIV-1 infection did not demonstrate HIV-1 replication inhibition, and cell viability was restored to that seen in other infections with similar GML exposure times (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these findings, addition of GML 24 h after HIV-1 infection did not inhibit HIV-1 replication at noncytotoxic concentrations (\u226440 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that the HIV-1-inhibitory effect of GML occurs during binding and/or entry and that it does not condition cells to protect against infection.",

At nontoxic GML concentrations (Fig. S2B), minimal reduction in total surface plus intracellular virus was observed compared to the no-GML control (Fig. 2C, left).

Virus binding, entry, and infection were assessed for these GML-treated virions as described above. Replication of HIV-1 exposed to GML was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A). This did not appear to be a result of residual GML, as virus incubated in cytotoxic concentrations (160 \u03bcg/ml) of GML showed no reduction of cell viability (Fig. 3B). Reduced infectivity could not be attributed to a reduction in the ability of virus to bind to cells (Fig. 3C).

Cell surface virus was removed with trypsin prior to analysis. GML reduction of intracellular virus (32%) was comparable to the reduction in luciferase mediated by the HIV-1 LTR promoter in infected cells treated with GML (38%) (Fig. 4A to C). Although HIV-1 entry can be mediated via the endocytic pathway, this route is generally nonproductive (30), and productive entry occurs following binding of the gp120 trimer to its receptor (CD4) followed by conformational changes allowing binding to one of two main coreceptors and followed by fusion with the cell plasma membrane (31). These data suggest that GML restricts HIV-1 replication at a step after receptor binding (Fig. 2).",

GML treatment of coincubated cells did not significantly reduce cell-cell fusion as measured by the percentages of cells positive for both fluorescent markers (Fig. 4D and E). Thus, GML does not interfere with HIV-1 gp120 binding to CD4, and GML does not block postbinding fusion. To determine if GML interfered with HIV-1-coreceptor interactions, TZM-bl cells were treated with a CXCR4 inhibitor (AMD3100) 1 h prior to infection, and GML was added at the time of HIV-1 inoculation. Treatment with nontoxic concentrations of GML (\u226440 \u03bcg/ml; Fig. S2C) did not increase infectivity inhibition compared to effects seen with the inhibitor alone (Fig. 4F). The finding that GML did not interfere with CD4 binding (Fig. 2) and yet did not influence coreceptor blockade or fusion suggests that GML alters conformational changes in the HIV gp120 trimer structure required for coreceptor binding (Fig. 4F) (32). To evaluate if GML alters virion binding to the coreceptor, HIV-1 was incubated with soluble CD4 (sCD4) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C to induce the conformational changes required for coreceptor binding (33, 34). Addition of nontoxic GML (40 \u03bcg/ml; Fig. S2D) to sCD4-treated HIV-1 and spinoculation onto HOS CXCR4+ CD4\u2212 cells revealed that GML significantly reduced entry of HIV-1 in CD4-negative cells (Fig. 4G). Together, these results demonstrate that GML alters HIV-1 replication by restricting viral entry after CD4 binding but before CXCR4 interactions (Fig. 4).",

Since virus binding and entry are required for all viral infections, we examined the effect of GML on additional viruses (35). We assessed the effect of GML on positive-strand and negative-strand RNA virus replication in permissive cell lines (mumps virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus). GML protected cells against infection by all three viruses at noncytotoxic concentrations (Fig. 5). Calculation of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of GML against mumps virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus gave values of 31, 45, and 59 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Fig. 5). Thus, GML is not specific to HIV-1 and potentially functions as a broad-spectrum antiviral in addition to its known antibacterial and immunoregulatory properties (8\u201310, 12, 13, 16, 17).",

Following isopycnic banding in cesium chloride gradients (38), particles were separated into purified light (enveloped) and heavy (nonenveloped) HAV particles. GML inhibited replication of light HAV particles, whereas GML had no effect on the heavy particles (Fig. 6E).

            "text": "The inhibitory concentrations differed for mumps virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika viruses. Many enveloped viruses require processing of their envelope glycoproteins to mediate entry (39). For flaviviruses, a cellular protease (furin) is responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the precursor envelope (prM) proteins. The uncleaved prM conformation prevents viral fusion (40). Although furin cleavage results in \u201cmaturation\u201d of virus particles, virus populations consist of a mixture of particles with various degrees of maturation and furin cleavage is not required for all functions of viral envelope proteins (39, 41). Viruses with a higher proportion of cleaved prM have higher specific infectivity (42). We hypothesized that GML interaction may be enhanced in \u201cimmature\u201d flaviviruses on the basis of increased access of GML to the viral envelope and that, by increasing the proportion of mature particles with furin treatment, flaviviruses are rendered more sensitive to GML inhibition. Zika virus was less sensitive to GML than YFV, and furin treatment did not change the GML sensitivity of Zika virus (Fig. 7A). In contrast, incubation of yellow fever virus in furin increased the IC50 by 10 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 7B). Similarly, HIV-1 infectivity was increased following incubation in furin, although this increase was more modest (Fig. 7C). The reduced sensitivity to GML following furin treatment for yellow fever virus and HIV-1 suggests that the maturation state of viral particles is important in GML antiviral activity and that Zika virus prM cleavage was more efficient than YFV cleavage in our production cell lines. The efficiency of Zika virus prM cleavage is currently unknown (43). Unfortunately, monoclonal antibodies that distinguish mature and immature Zika and YFV particles have not been described, and the available polyclonal antibodies do not distinguish the size differences of PrM and M. Thus, though the data are consistent with the hypothesis that GML access lipids in the YFV immature particles, further studies are needed for confirmation.",

            "text": "Reutericyclin, a GML analogue, is secreted by isolates of Lactobacillus reuteri as well as Enterococcus faecalis (Fig. 8A and B). Reutericyclin inhibits a broad spectrum of bacterial organisms, but its inhibitory profile is unreported for viruses (24). Nevertheless, previous studies found that Lactobacillus reuteri enhances host resistance to viral infections, possibly through regulation of the microenvironment and through the secretion of antiviral metabolites (44). Incubation of HIV-1 with various dilutions of concentrated reutericyclin-containing media produced by E. faecalis and Lactobacillus reuteri significantly reduced infection at even highly diluted concentrations (Fig. 8C to E). Media without the microbe or conditioned media in the presence of a non-reutericyclin-producing strain of Lactobacillus plantarum served as controls (Fig. 8C to E). Media without bacteria and conditioned media from non-reutericyclin-producing Lactobacillus plantarum were noncytotoxic and also reduced infection, though conditioned media from reutericyclin-producing microbes inhibited HIV-1 to a significantly greater extent (Fig. S3A and B). Reduced infection by our controls indicated that microbe growth media may contain inhibitory components and that Lactobacillus may produce other HIV-1-inhibitory metabolites. Others have reported non-reutericyclin-based mechanisms of Lactobacillus-mediated inhibition of HIV-1, including secretion of other antimicrobial factors (24, 25). Because reutericyclin-containing media from bacterial secretions contain additional metabolites, high-pressure-liquid-chromatography (HPLC)-purified reutericyclin was used to validate the HIV-1-inhibitory effect of reutericyclin. HPLC-purified reutericyclin was noncytotoxic (Fig. S3B) and inhibited HIV-1 infection by 40% to 50% (Fig. 8F), suggesting that reutericyclin is an effective inhibitory factor against HIV-1 and supporting the observation that Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microenvironments are protective against HIV-1. We hypothesize that microbe-produced reutericyclin is more inhibitory than HPLC-purified reutericyclin due to the secretion of additional antiviral factors in the media. Others have reported antimicrobial properties of reutericin and reuterin secreted by Lactobacillus reuteri, though antiviral effects (45\u201347) have not been studied. These results support the hypothesis that Lactobacillus may secrete inhibitory factors in addition to contributing other protective functions such as maintenance of vaginal pH (48).",

Although the inhibition was due partly to a reduction in virus binding to CD4+, the major step of the HIV-1 life cycle inhibited by GML was viral entry following CD4+ binding. Our data show that GML prevents virion binding to the coreceptor (Fig. 9). In addition to the antiviral mechanism of GML against virus replication, other studies found that GML also blocks immune signaling (14, 16). Thus, it is likely that GML inhibits HIV-1 and other viruses by multiple mechanisms.",

These findings are consistent with those reported by others showing that monoglycerides inhibited enveloped HSV-1 and HSV-2, VSV, and visna virus infections but were unable to restrict nonenveloped poliovirus or rhinovirus infection (18\u201322). We further show that GML effects on enveloped viruses are influenced by the state of envelope maturation. It remains unknown whether GML induces conformational changes to the viral lipid envelope or interferes with envelope interactions with host factors mediating virus binding, fusion, or other steps in the entry process. EM imaging and sedimentation analysis data from similar studies indicate significant conformational disruption of the viral envelope (18\u201322).",

Our data suggest that reutericyclin released by Lactobacillus may be a secreted factor that contributes to the protective effect induced by reutericyclin-expressing bacteria. Although reutericyclin is known to inhibit bacteria, no previous reports have shown activity against viruses (24). There are structural similarities between GML and reutericyclin, and these may provide insights into the inhibitory action and facilitate the development of more efficacious derivatives. The importance of fatty acid chain length and head group polarity with respect to virus inhibition is not yet known. Similar studies showed that 12-carbon lauric acid was the most effective of various carbon chain lengths at inhibiting Junin virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. However, those groups concluded that lauric acid disrupted maturation, a late viral life cycle event, rather than early life cycle events (51, 52). Others showed that HIV-1, HSV, and hepatitis C virus are inhibited by contact with medium-chain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and 1-monoglycerides of medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids and their derivatives disrupted the viral envelope, suggesting an early effect (19, 53\u201355). Therefore, the fatty acid chains of GML and reutericyclin may be more important than the polarity of the head group during enveloped virus inhibition.",
