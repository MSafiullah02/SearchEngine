We agree with Belay et al. that the timing of sample collection and the type of sample screened (nasal vs. pharyngeal) may explain the discrepancy in results between their study and ours. Furthermore, more than one etiological agent may be linked to Kawasaki disease. Nonetheless, we are intrigued by the study by Graf that suggests the presence of a peptide, corresponding to the spike protein of HCoV-NL63, in tissue from individuals with Kawasaki disease [9] . These findings further support the association between HCoV-NH and Kawasaki disease.",

As I pointed out clearly, Esper et al. [3] were unaware of van der Hoek et al.'s discovery of the Netherlands strain of human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) when they designed their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and apparently also when they first found the HCoV they designated the \"New Haven coronavirus\" (HCoV-NH). I described the methodology used by Esper et al. for finding the virus as \"logical, intelligent, and highly original\" (p. 489)-as was, in fact, the different methodology used by van der Hoek et al.-and the development of this methodology seemed to me at least as notable an accomplishment as the discovery of a \"new\" virus. In my Editorial Commentary, I also stated that HCoV-NH appeared to be similar to, and quite possibly (although not certainly) the same as, HCoV-NL63. The published sequence of HCoV-NH, which covered only a portion of a single gene from this very large genome, did not seem to be adequate to make a final decision on this point, however.",
