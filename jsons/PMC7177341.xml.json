            "text": "As a result of the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, became a focus of global attention. After the first case of coronavirus was reported in Wuhan in December 2019, which was not the source of the virus, the coronavirus spread to domestic and foreign areas, resulting in a significant threat to the world. The 2019-nCoV situation reports, published by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 25 February 2020, show that 77,780 cases had been confirmed in China. Outside of China, the number of confirmed cases was 2459, and 2700 infected patients had died [1]. Consequently, the WHO has classified the 2019-nCoV epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. China and other affected countries have adopted a series of response measures to prevent and control this extraordinary public safety event [2]. ",

            "text": "Indeed, to effectively prevent and control this epidemic, one of the most critical tasks is to clearly and comprehensively understand the epidemic from different perspectives. Currently, a large body of research has been accomplished, especially in the field of medicine. Mainly, these investigations focus on the genomic characterization of the novel coronavirus [3,4], the clinical characterization of the infected patients [5,6], and the medical diagnosis and treatment of the infected cases [7,8]. The medical research immensely contributes to the recognition of the virus\u2019 characteristics and to obtaining the cure. However, no study has discussed the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic. Mainly, the spatio-temporal patterns describe the epidemical characteristics, including spatio-temporal distribution (regular, clustered, or random), spatio-temporal association, and spatio-temporal evolution [9]. This is beneficial for enhancing the understanding of this epidemic in the spatio-temporal dimension and providing reliable information for decision-making. For example, Liu et al. [10] and Dong et al. [11] analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in mainland China in 2013. Their results showed that there existed spatially clustered characteristics. Meanwhile, the research by Qiu et al. [12] identified additional risk factors. To understand the dynamic spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea in 2013 in the US, global and local analysis methods uncovered the spatio-temporal patterns of this epidemic [13]. The spatio-temporal distribution and diffusion pattern of the dengue outbreak in Swat, Pakistan, in 2013, was also discovered based on the spatio-temporal analysis method, and the implications were assessed and recommendations were made [14]. Spatio-temporal patterns (i.e., trends and clusters) of influenza in 2005\u20132018, in China, were detected by spatio-temporal analysis where high-risk areas and the corresponding reasons were identified [15].",

A temporal trend is a continued increase or decrease in the time series of the number of daily new confirmed cases that can describe the epidemical risk for a given period. Generally, the trend changes smoothly or regularly and can be seen from the commonly used epidemic models [16]. However, owing to the interference of specific events (such as large-scale vaccination and isolating suspected cases), an abrupt change in the time series of daily new confirmed cases may occur. Therefore, based on the level of significance of these trends (i.e., increasing or decreasing trends) and significant abrupt change, six types of temporal patterns can be defined (see Table 1). The ITAC pattern has an Increasing Trend and an Abrupt Change, while the ITNO pattern has an Increasing Trend only, and the DTAC pattern has a Decreasing Trend and an Abrupt Change. Moreover, the DTNO pattern has a Decreasing Trend only, while the NOAC pattern has Abrupt Change only, and the NONO pattern has none of these two characteristics.",

After confirming that the 2019-nCoV epidemic could spread among people, Wuhan was sealed in an emergency to control the transmission of infections from January 23, 2020. Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, is situated in east-central Hubei and constitutes over a fifth of the province\u2019s population. It is recognized as the political, economic, financial, cultural, educational, and transportation center of central China. Because Wuhan is also one of the largest integrated transportation and communication hubs in China, there is a large amount of population interaction and mobility between Wuhan and other areas, both inside and outside of the province. The big data map of migration published by Baidu (https://voice.baidu.com/act/newpneumonia/newpneumonia/?from=osari_pc_1) shows that the destinations of most of the population departing from Wuhan before January 23 are the cities or counties inside Hubei province, especially its surrounding areas. Because of the incubation period of 0 to 14 days and the mean period of 6.4 days [28], quite a few virus carriers did not receive treatment in isolation and the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission was not effectively controlled during a specific period after January 23. Most of the surrounding areas had to face the difficulty of an increasing trend of daily new confirmed cases. Compared to areas showing increasing trends, the areas with decreasing trends (i.e., DTAC and DTNO) were randomly distributed. ",

Before this day, the number of daily new confirmed cases was approximately 400 to 1,000, and after this day, the numbers fluctuate around 1750. One possible reason is that the number of infected cases was still increasing. However, a more important reason is that on February 2, as a result of the insufficient diagnostic resources, there were lots of suspected cases that had not yet been confirmed. The local government emphasized that they must enhance the ability to examine the infection by several measures, such as providing full payment to third-party examiners, simplification of the examination process, and strengthening the quality of sample allocation and inspection. The abrupt change in Ezhou, on February 7, can be attributed to similar factors to those mentioned above, namely, the improvement of the ability of the medical service. Ezhou was one of the most severely affected areas, and the lack of medical workers greatly affected diagnosis and treatment. On account of this, on February 4, a proposal published by the local disease command invited the retired, resigned, and independent medical workers to return to work. Meanwhile, a medical team from Peking University International Hospital arrived in Ezhou to participate in disease control on February 7.",
