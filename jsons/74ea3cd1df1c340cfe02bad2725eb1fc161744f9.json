Low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, common in people with obesity, is associated with the development of atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, well known comorbidities that adversely affect the outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Risk stratification based on the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS), which classifies obesity based on the presence of medical, mental, and/or functional complications rather than on body mass index (BMI), has been shown to be a better predictor of all-cause mortality and it may well be that EOSS stages may better describe the risk of hyperinflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection. Analyzing a group of metabolic ill patients with obesity (EOSS 2 and 3), we found an increased interleukin-6 and linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation with C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.014) and waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) (p = 0.031). Physicians should be aware of these findings in patients with COVID-19 infection. Early identification of possible hyperinflammation could be fundamental and should guide decision making regarding hospitalization, early respiratory support, and therapy with immunosuppression to improve mortality.",

Given the coexistence of a world-wide epidemic of obesity, which in some Western countries affects up to a 40% of the general population [1] , it is prudent to consider the impact that COVID-19 infection can have on people living with obesity. Notably, elevated body mass index (BMI) and obesity were predictors of poor outcomes and fatalities due to H1N1 [2] . Moreover, observations from Wuhan show that hypertension (30%), diabetes (22%), and coronary artery disease (22%), all of which are more common in people living with obesity, were the most common comorbidities in patients requiring hospitalisation [3, 4] . Poorly, in the Chinese studies obesity rates were not reported.",

The innate immune response in patients with obesity is altered and leads to an altered first line of defense, increased inflammatory response, and abnormal T-cell response [6] . Furthermore, the key role of IL-6 in mediating the acute phase response and its value as a prognostic biomarker in sepsis and various acute organ injuries has been extensively investigated in clinical and experimental studies [7] .

Physicians should be aware of the risk of hyperinflammation in Table 1 Baseline demographic data of a subpopulation of patients (n = 33), who participated in the inflammation study [20, 21] and underwent measurement of IL-6 (pg/ml) in the standard preoperative work up. Standard values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are <5 mg/l and <7 pg/ml. patients with COVID-19 infection. EOSS stages may better describe the risk of hyperinflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection than BMI. Early identification of possible hyperinflammation could be fundamental and should guide decision-making regarding hospitalization, early respiratory support, and therapy with immunosuppression to improve mortality.",
