While the number of ATI and ATII cells in the alveolar epithelium is equal, ATI cells represent \u223c95% of the alveolar surface area [4]. Under physiological conditions, the alveolo-capillary barrier is highly impermeable, primarily due to the tight epithelial barrier, while the capillary endothelium is more leaky [5]. Interestingly, there appears to be a cross-talk between these monolayers. In an elegant series of experiments Kuebler and coworkers have demonstrated that inflammatory stimuli to the alveoli initiate rapid alveolo-capillary signaling leading to propagation of the inflammation [6]. Thus the alveolar epithelium might play a central role in modulating endothelial cell biology.",

Sodium is taken up on the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium by amiloride-sensitive and -insensitive Na+ channels [8, 9] and is subsequently \u201cpumped\u201d out of the cell by the Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase) on the basolateral side [10, 11] (Fig. 1). This process generates an osmotic gradient, which drives passive movement of water from the apical side of the epithelium (the alveolar space) to the basolateral side (the interstitium) paracellularly and through aquaporin-5 water channels which are located in ATI cells [12]. Extensive research on human lungs and in animal models has demonstrated that alveolar fluid clearance is inhibited by amiloride, an inhibitor of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC), as well as by the Na,K-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain [12]. Moreover, in ENaC\u03b1(-/-) mice Na+ transport was found to be defective, resulting in fatal respiratory distress of the neonates [13]. Furthermore, it has been well established that up-regulation of ENaC and Na,K-ATPase increases active Na+ transport, leading to increased ability of the lungs to clear edema [14, 15].\n\n",

            "text": "The Na,K-ATPase is a transmembrane protein expressed on the basolateral surface of most mammalian epithelial cells. In an ATP-consuming process, it maintains gradients of Na+and K+across the plasma membrane by pumping three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two ions of potassium into the cell, accounting for up to 40% of a cell's energy expenditure [10]. The Na,K-ATPase is a heterodimeric holoenzyme composed of an \u03b1- and a \u03b2-subunit. The catalytic \u03b1-subunit is a large polypeptide comprising approximately 1,000 amino acid residues, spanning the plasma membrane 10 times. This subunit contains sites for cleavage of high-energy phosphate bonds, binding of Na+, K+ and nucleotides, and binding of the classic Na,K-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain [16]. Four \u03b1-isoforms have been identified (\u03b11 \u2013 \u03b14), each with a unique tissue distribution [17, 18]. The \u03b11 and \u03b12 Na,K-ATPase subunits are expressed in the alveolar epithelium [19\u201321]. The glycosylated \u03b2-subunit, a smaller polypeptide comprising approximately 370 amino acid residues, has a single membrane-spanning domain and regulates the membrane insertion and activity of the enzyme [16, 22]. Four \u03b2-isoforms have been reported (\u03b21 \u2013 \u03b24), which are also expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner [23]. Recently a small, transmembrane protein of the FXYD family (characterized by the short invariant sequence of phenylalanine-X-tyrosine-aspartate) has been identified as a \u03b3-subunit, which associates with the Na,K-ATPase in some tissues [24]. Though it may have an important role in regulating the affinity of the sodium pump for ATP, recent evidence suggests that this \u03b3-subunit is not an integral part of the holoenzyme complex [25].",

Removal of extracellular Na+, though it did disturb the transmembrane gradient, did not prevent formation of tight junctions or the establishment of polarity [33]. Therefore, aspects of cell function which depend on a transmembrane Na+gradient, such as cytoplasmic pH or calcium concentration, are not likely to be involved in Na,K-ATPase regulation of tight junctions. Alternative signaling mechanisms as a modulator of barrier function have been suggested, including normal intracellular Na+ homeostasis, a decrease in cell K+ concentration, depolarization of the plasma membrane potential, and small cell volume changes [32]. Recently, signaling pathways involved in this tight junction regulation have been described. For example, a role for RhoA GTPase, a Ras-related small GTP-binding protein, in the formation of functional tight junctions [29], where overexpression of RhoA GTPase partially interrupted the negative effect of Na,K-ATPase inhibition on tight junction integrity. Conversely, endogenous RhoA activity was found to be significantly decreased in Na,K-ATPase-inhibited cells, suggesting that RhoA GTPase acts downstream of Na,K-ATPase to regulate tight junction formation [33].",

            "text": "Mechanisms of hypoxia-induced inhibition of Na+ transport depend on the duration and severity of the hypoxic exposure. Transepithelial Na+ transport is inhibited in both A549 human epithelial adenocarcinoma cells and in primary rat epithelial ATII cells upon exposure to hypoxia (3% O2) [43]. Short-term exposure of alveolar epithelial cells (as early as 15 min) to severe hypoxia (1.5% O2) induced a time-dependent decrease in the number of Na,K-ATPase molecules at the plasma membrane of alveolar epithelial cells. Hypoxia caused a rapid increase in levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to activation and translocation of PKC-\u03b6 from cytosolic to membrane compartments of the cells. PKC-\u03b6 directly phosphorylated the Na,K-ATPase \u03b11-subunit at the Ser-18 residue, thereby promoting Na,K-ATPase endocytosis [45]. In contrast, long-term exposure to severe hypoxia down-regulated both ENaC and Na,K-ATPase at both mRNA and protein levels [43, 46]. However, a recent report suggested that prolonged exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to severe hypoxia (1.5% O2) resulted in preferential degradation of the plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase, via the ubiquitin-conjugating system. This degradation led to decreases in Na+ pump activity and oxygen consumption [47]. Plasma membrane-associated Na,K-ATPase, which represents the active, ATP-consuming Na+ pump population, was most vulnerable to hypoxic effects. In contrast, intracellular pools, representing an inactive form of the Na,K-ATPase, required 24\u201330  h exposure to hypoxia before degradation was observed. These findings suggested that cellular adaptation to hypoxia involves decreased ATP consumption, particularly by conserving ATP utilization by the Na,K-ATPase. More detailed reviews on hypoxia-mediated effects of alveolar fluid reabsorption are available [27, 48, 49].",

Thrombin decreased Na,K-ATPase activity by promoting its endocytosis from the plasma membrane, which interestingly, just as in hypoxic exposure, was mediated by ROS and PKC-\u03b6 [51], suggesting a central role for these signaling pathways in the regulation of edema clearance. Understanding the role of signaling induced by elements of the enhanced coagulation cascade in ALI/ARDS has yielded, and will likely continue to yield, new therapeutic approaches, including antithrombin III, thrombomodulin, heparin, activated protein C and tissue factor pathway inhibitor.

Furthermore, Frank and coworkers demonstrated that ventilation with high tidal volumes for 2 h resulted in inhibition of cAMP-dependent alveolar fluid reabsorption, through activation of nitric oxide synthase 2 and increased formation of reactive nitrogen species [54].

In particular, signaling pathways involved in the \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity have been investigated in detail [11, 44]. Short-term stimulation of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol (ISO) has been found to result in receptor-dependent activation of the G protein Gs, which successively stimulates adenylyl cyclase, resulting in enhanced cAMP generation and consequent activation of PKA, which leads to phosphorylation of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, and switching of the receptor's G protein coupling specificity from Gs to Gi. This switch in turn activates RhoA and its downstream effector RhoA-associated kinase, leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton necessary for Na,K-ATPase exocytosis and consequent increase in Na,K-ATPase activity [66].",

Interestingly, this increase in protein abundance following ISO incubation was not found to be associated with changes in mRNA levels, suggesting that the increase in sodium pump protein abundance is regulated post-transcriptionally [67]. The signaling mechanisms in this post-transcriptional regulation of Na,K-ATPase by ISO involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by utilizing the epidermal growth factor receptor as a scaffold protein, which in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and rapamycin-sensitive pathways [mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)]. The mTOR pathway has been implicated in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase translation, which involves activation of the protein S6 kinase (p70S6k) enzymatic complex [68].

Treatment of alveolar epithelial cells with dopamine for only minutes results in translocation of Na,K-ATPase from intracellular pools to the basolateral membrane of the cell. This short-term effect is mediated by D1 receptors and activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that plays an important role in the trafficking of transporters [72]. PP2A was suggested to be involved in dephosphorylation of the sodium pump, an initial signal in its trafficking [73]. Recently, it has been reported that PP2A directly interacts with the N-terminus of the Na,K-ATPase \u03b11-subunit, leading to its dephosphorylation at the Ser-18 residue and its recruitment to the plasma membrane from intracellular compartments in alveolar epithelial cells [74]. It has also been shown that PKC-\u03b4 and PKC-\u03b5 were essential for dopamine-induced Na,K-ATPase exocytosis and increased activity [75]. These PKCs are differentially compartmentalized, and activation of PKC-\u03b4 precedes that of PKC-\u03b5. Whether PKC-\u03b4 and -\u03b5 phosphorylate intermediate proteins, such as actin or other adapter proteins, that subsequently regulate Na,K-ATPase function in the lung remains unresolved.",

Treatment of alveolar epithelial cells with dopamine for long periods of time (24 h) activated the MAPK pathway via D2 receptors, resulting in increased Na,K-ATPase activity. This effect is mediated by Ras, which associates with the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1. Raf-1 subsequently phosphorylates and activates the downstream kinase MAPK kinase MEK1, the direct activator of ERK proteins [76]. This dopamine-induced activation of ERK leads to a significant increases in Na-K-ATPase \u03b21-subunit mRNA and protein levels and thus increases abundance of functional Na,K-ATPase molecules in the plasma membrane [77].

Exposing alveolar epithelial monolayers to keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) resulted in a sustained increase of active transcellular Na+ transport [82]. Similarly, epidermal growth factor (EGF) also increased lung liquid clearance [83]. While EGF increased both Na,K-ATPase \u03b11- and \u03b21-subunit mRNA and protein levels it did not enhance ENaC expression [84], but induced non-selective cation channels in ATII cells [85]. Fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10), a protein structurally similar to KGF, is also a potent mitogen that promotes epithelial cell differentiation and wound healing [86]. Treatment of ATII cells with FGF-10 increased Na,K-ATPase activity and membrane protein abundance within 30 min without changing the Na,K-ATPase \u03b11-subunit protein levels in total cell lysates (in contrast to the long-term effects of KGF or EGF), thus demonstrating recruitment of Na,K-ATPase from intracellular pools [87]. FGF-10 effects were prevented by the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126, suggesting that the FGF-10-induced activation of the Na+ pump was mediated by ERK-1/2 [87]. Thus, growth factors not only facilitate re-epithelialization of the alveolar barrier but may also have beneficial effects in edema resolution. A schematic representation of mechanisms up-regulating cell surface abundance of Na,K-ATPase, and thus alveolar edema clearance, is depicted in Fig. 3.\n\n",
