The immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks are prototypical examples of the emerging infectious diseases that the public did not face prior to the 1980s and 2003, respectively. A \u201cre-emerging infection\u201d is a familiar infection that recurs. Influenza A virus pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968 are prototypical examples of re-emerging infections.",

The high mutation rate of RNA viruses is due to the poor fidelity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase [RT]) in which there is an absence of the 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 proofreading exonuclease. Thus, the point mutation rates among RNA viruses is approximately 10\u22124 to 10\u22125, whereas in DNA viruses it is 10\u22128 to 10\u221211\n[1]. In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the in vivo point mutation rate is 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mutations per bp per replication cycle (i.e. 2 mutations in 5 new genomes produced) [2]. The mutation rate of the SARS-CoV during the 2002\u20132003 epidemic was estimated to be 8.26 \u00d7 10\u22126 per nt per day (i.e. 3 mutations per RNA in every round of replication) [3].",

In the case of influenza A virus, the accumulation of a series of point mutations on the influenza virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) results in amino acid residue substitutions on antigenic sites of HA [5].

Antigenic shift causes dramatic changes in the influenza virus surface glycoproteins HA and/or neuraminidase (NA). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, when two different strains of influenza A viruses co-infect the same cell, progeny viruses may inherit sets of RNA segments made up of combinations of segments from either of the parent viruses.

            "text": "HIV originated in Africa between the late 1940s and the early 1950s. The earliest known case was in 1959, in a man from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, formerly, Belgian Congo). His blood, stored since 1959, tested positive for HIV [23]. HIV is now not considered a zoonosis, since every case of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is acquired from another human being. However, HIV was zoonotic in origin. It was a cross-species transmission from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is found in nonhuman primates, to human beings several decades earlier [20], [24]. In fact, HIV and SIV are transmitted the same way (i.e. blood-borne) and found in blood. The two viruses are very similar in genomic organization. Data from phylogenetic trees and geographic habitats show that HIV-1 is most closely related to SIVcpz, an SIV found in a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) [25]. Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is most closely identified with SIVsm, an SIV found in the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) [26]. Although HIV causes AIDS in humans, SIV does not cause any disease in its natural hosts. SIVs might enter man via monkey blood and could be transmitted from nonhuman primates to humans either by eating raw monkey meat, drinking monkey blood, or perhaps through another method of direct exposure to monkey bodily fluids (\nFig. 4).",

In the Chinese culture, fresh foods from wild animals are considered great delicacies, (called \u201cwild taste\u201d). The captured wild animals are bred in markets or restaurants for human consumption and kept in squalid animal-holding cages made of metal or wood. It has been thought that a zoonotic virus can be transmitted from animals to food handlers who handle, kill, or butcher animals. Direct contact of humans with animal blood, bodily fluids, or excreta during food handling appears to be the simplest and most plausible explanation for the cross-species transmission of viruses.",

Several of the SARS index patients worked as restaurant chefs, food handlers, or lived near the live-animal market [27]. Although scientists isolated SARS-CoV from caged Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in wild animal markets in Guangdong [28], civets from the wild were free from SARS-CoV infection [29].

In pigsties located around the fruit orchards, pigs ingested bat saliva from half-eaten dropped fruit containing the NiV.

In order to let the blood donors sell their blood more frequently without developing anemia, the blood centers pooled the blood, retained the plasma, and re-infused the remaining red blood cells back into the blood donors. Therefore, at least 250,000 paid blood donors in seven provinces in central China may have been infected with HIV through this procedure, as well as through the reuse of needles and non-sterilized equipment.
