Although outbreaks of EV-D68 infection occurred in the Philippines [2], Italy [[3], [4]], the Netherlands [5] and Japan [6] between 2005 and 2012, it was only in 2014 that the virus gained epidemiological and clinical relevance. In that year, a large-scale outbreak of severe respiratory infections due to this agent, in some cases associated with central nervous system diseases, occurred in the USA and Canada [7], with subsequent cases in other countries [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Since that period, several outbreaks in different continents have been reported, and it was confirmed that the virus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract diseases and be associated with the development of neurological problems, including acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), encephalitis and aseptic meningitis [[17], [18], [19]].",

Moreover, within clades, subgroups were identified according to amino acid substitutions in structural and nonstructural proteins. Several studies have shown that these different clades and subgroups can circulate or co-circulate during different periods and be associated with both mild and severe diseases [21]. However, little is known about the molecular evolution of this virus during outbreaks, and it is not precisely defined whether specific genetic variances are responsible for the most severe cases. Studies regarding the molecular phylogeny, diversity, and epidemiology of EV-D68 are essential to understanding the evolution of this virus and its adaptation to the human host. Moreover, they can contribute to the development of effective preventive and therapeutic measures.",

SLAC counts the number of non-synonymous changes per non-synonymous site (dN) and tests whether it is significantly different from the number of synonymous changes per synonymous site (dS). FEL estimates the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes for each site in an alignment [29]. The IFEL method is similar to FEL but tests for site-by-site selection only along internal branches of the phylogeny. To avoid an excessive false-positive rate, sites with SLAC, FEL, IFEL and MEME p-values of <0.1 and a FUBAR posterior probability of >0.90 were accepted as candidates for selection.",

Twenty-two patients (13 males; 59.1%), mean age 47 months (range, 1\u2013174 months) were found to be infected by EV-D68 (Table 1\n). The majority of cases (14/22; 63.6%) occurred in June (n = 9) and July (n = 5). The remaining cases were observed in April (n = 1), May (n = 2), September (n = 2), and October (n = 3). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 12 (54.5%) children, whereas viral wheezing, rhinopharyngitis, asthma and bronchiolitis, were diagnosed in four children, three children, two children, and one child, respectively. The previous clinical history was negative in most of the cases (16/22; 72.7%). However, two (9.1%) children previously suffered from leukemia and had been recently transplanted with hematopoietic stem cells; 2 (9.1%) children had a history of recurrent episodes of viral wheezing; and 2 (9.1%) children had allergic asthma. The disease severity was judged to be mild-to-moderate in all the patients. Lower than 92% oxygen saturation (SaO2) values at the first visit in the emergency room were found only in 5 (22.7%) children. Hospitalization occurred in 19/22 (86.4%) children, with a mean duration of 4 days (range, 4\u20138 days). None of the patients had to be admitted to the intensive care unit. In 16/22 (72.7%) cases, EV-D68 was the only infectious agent detected in the respiratory samples. Coinfection with human adenovirus (hAdV) and with human rhinovirus (hRV) was detected in 4 (18.2%) and 2 (9.1%) of the children, respectively. In all these cases, coinfecting agents were detected in very low concentrations (almost all below 1.0 \u00d7 103 copies/mL). The median EV-D68 load observed was 1.3 \u00d7 105 RNA copies/mL of respiratory sample (range, 9.0 \u00d7 102\u20135.1 \u00d7 106 RNA copies/mL of respiratory sample). No association was found between disease severity (measured by the SaO2 values) and EV-D68 load. The 368 samples negative for EV-D68 resulted positive for hRV (60.2%), RSV (26.6%), bocavirus (10.1%), hMPV (8.2%), and hAdV (7.9%). In 48 (13%) cases, particularly when hRV was detected, coinfection between two viruses was evidenced. Ten children with RSV infection, two with hMPV and one with hAdV were hospitalized for severe disease and three of those with RSV required admission to the intensive care unit.",

Consequently, no definitive data regarding the epidemiology and clinical relevance of this infectious agent in children could be drawn. However, the collected data enables the integration of available information regarding the circulation of and genetic differences among different EV-D68 clades and can help elucidate the molecular evolution of this virus. The four EV-D68 clades have exhibited a differing predominance in recent years. The Italian EV-D68 strains identified in 2008 belonged to clade A and clade C. Clade A was again identified in 2010, but in 2012, clade B became predominant [4]. During the 2014 EV-D68 epidemic in Europe, most of the 205 sequenced viruses collected in 17 countries in the second semester of the year were found to belong to B1 and B2 clades, whereas A clades, although co-circulating, were detected in a smaller number of patients [31]. Since April 2016, EV-D68 infection outbreaks have been reported in several European countries, particularly in Northern Europe [[31], [32], [33]]. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these viruses belonged to the B3 lineage [32]. The same results were obtained with this study, suggesting that all the 2016 European outbreaks originated from a common source and that the B3 clade has emerged and become preeminent, eclipsing clades A and clades B1 and B2. The worldwide importance of clade B3 appears to be confirmed by the evidence that outbreaks of infections due to EV-D68 infection belonging to clade B3 have been reported in 2015 in China [34], and almost simultaneously with the European epidemics, in the USA [35].",

Other viral variants were identified in EV-D68 strains associated with severe disease in Taiwan [41]; moreover, in this case, it was proposed that the variants were associated with the severity of EV-D68. However, these findings have not been completely confirmed by other studies [[20], [42]]. By contrast, based on our strains sequences analyses, no evidence of increased clinical severity associated with specific molecular signatures in VP1 sequences has emerged from the present study.

            "text": "Based on adaptive evolution analysis, the overall dN/dS ratio (dN/dS <1) of the VP1 gene observed in this study was similar to those reported by Lau et al. [43] Although several amino acid changes have been observed in VP1 sequences the meaning of dN/dS ratio reveal a purifying (negative) evolution for the VP1 protein. In addition, in keeping with this report, no codons with a significant signal of positive selective pressure were detected in the VP1 gene. By contrast, the phylogenetic analysis showed how the genetic changes may have driven the emergence of a new lineage of EV-D68 during the last 2 years. In fact, the worldwide circulation of EV-D68 strains belonging to the B2 and B3 lineages might have evolved from a common ancestor originating in 2011\u20132012 [44]. Recently, the evolutionary analyses performed on complete genome sequences have suggested that subclade B3 was not originated by a mutation occurred on subclade B1 strains. Indeed, it has been suggested a distinct evolutionary origin for the new B3 subclade [45]. Multiple clades of EV-D68 have worldwide circulated simultaneously between 2005 and 2014 [9], while a predominance of one clade (subclade B3) has recently been observed. Additional both epidemiological and molecular studies are needed to better clarify the reasons of this EV-D68 strain selection and widespread diffusion. It is interesting to note that the emergence of new EV-D68 lineages does not represent the circulation of a new virus. Therefore, diagnostic real-time assays, designed in a well conserved region (5\u2032 UTR), are capable to detect all the new EV-D68 variants.",

The circulation of one EV-D68 lineage has been proven in Italy as well as in the European region during 2016. However, further studies are required to investigate whether some strains or lineages may possess a higher affinity for the lower airway or central nervous system. In addition, the continuous global monitoring of the clinical and molecular epidemiology of EV-D68 should be improved to understand the factors determining possible spatiotemporal differences of EV-D68 infections.",
