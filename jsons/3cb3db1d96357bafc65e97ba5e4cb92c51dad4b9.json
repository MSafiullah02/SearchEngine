The 2 major classes of bactericidal AMPs in the mammalian immune system are the defensins and cathelicidins. Compared to eukaryotic cells, bacterial cell walls lack cholesterol-which acts to stabilize cell membranes-and negatively charged phospholipids. Instead, bacterial cell walls are rich in anions (basic amino acids) and thus attract the cationic defensins, which carpet the microbial membrane and institute channel formation. 26 These channels then lead to transmembrane pore formation, membrane destabilization, and microbial cell death, although recent studies suggest that their function could go beyond that of lipid bilayer perturbation. 27 Whereas a large number of AMPs form part of the non-oxidative killing mechanism within phagolysosomes in cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, a growing number are thought to be actively secreted onto epithelial surfaces of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urinary tracts [28] [29] [30] [31] -including the ovine gastrointestinal tract 32 and the canine testis. 33 Recent work has revealed that important amounts of these AMPs are secreted not only by immune cells such as neutrophils and alveolar macrophages but also by atypical defense cells such as type II pneumocytes. 34 This theme is universal throughout the processes of the innate immune system and challenges the traditional view of a \"standing army\" of immune defense cells, replacing it with the concept of a body-wide, integrated community of cells contributing to pathogen vigilance. 35 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 337, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1576, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1581, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1586, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1591, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Surface Barrier Mechanisms and Antimicrobial Peptides"}, {"text": "Two factors are vital to the rapid ability of the innate immune system to respond to pathogen incursion: the presence of receptors against pathogen markers and the ubiquitous nature of these receptors in the body. 35 Individual receptors are genetically encoded and display strong homology within and between species. 22 These receptors are not only expressed on many effector cells of the immune system-including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and lymphocytesbut are also found on epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and myocytes 36, 37 ; expression has also been detected in the bovine endometrium. 38 The major targets of these pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), although the presence of these molecules in nonpathogenic and commensal bacteria has led to the suggestion that the term \"microbial-associated molecular Although bacterial cell surface components such as LPS in the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and lipotechoic acid (LTA) in the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria represent classic examples of PAMPs, recognition of \"altered self\" secondary to host cell colonization by viral pathogens is also likely.

The cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of the TLRs interacts with TIR-domain-containing adaptors, such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), TIR-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1, also known as TRIF) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM2, also known as TRAM). PAMP binding to the respective receptor results in the activation of either the MyD88 or TICAM1/TRIF signaling pathways. These pathways involve a series of kinases in the IL-1R associated kinase (IRAK) family, whose action eventually results in activation of the inhibitor of j B kinase (IKK) enzyme complex and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitory IjBa protein, thus freeing the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB); triggering of the MAPK signaling pathway results in the activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1). Both NF-jB and AP-1 then initiate the transcription of cytokine genes.

Caspase-1 has been the focus of particular attention and is activated by a macromolecular complex of around 700 kDa-one of a number of inflamma-somes 133 -comprising pro-caspase-1 together with various adapter proteins, including apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal CARD (ASC). 133-135 Activation of the currently identified inflammasomes depends upon the interaction of NLR family members (NLRC4; NLR family, pyrin domain containing 1 [NLRP1] and NLRP3) with their PAMP or DAMP ligands. [136] [137] [138] Caspase-1 is thought to be the executioner caspase in inflammation, important in the synthesis of active IL-1b and IL-18 and thus pathogen defense. Hence, mice deficient in caspase-1 are more susceptible to bacterial infections and sepsis [139] [140] [141] ; in contrast, mice deficient in caspase-12, which normally suppresses caspase-1 activity, show enhanced bacterial clearance and resistance to sepsis. 142 Parallel observations have been made in human patients possessing the full-length caspase-12 proenzyme-uniquely present in approximately 20% of people of African descent-which attenuates the innate immune response to endotoxin and is thought to be a risk factor for the development of severe sepsis. 143 Whereas caspase-1 is essential for host defense against Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing protein (NLR) signaling pathways. Upon PAMP ligation, NLRs recruit the serine-threonine kinase RIP-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein (CLARP) kinase (RICK), also known as receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2 or RIP2), which binds to NF-jB essential modulator (NEMO), a subunit of IKK, resulting in the phosphorylation of IjB and the release of NF-jB; RICK also mediates the recruitment of transforming growth factor b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and together these molecules stimulate activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In common with the TLR family, NLR activation leads to the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes via the mobilization of NF-jB and AP-1. Another important consequence of NLR ligation is activation of the inflammasome, a macromolecular complex comprising pro-caspase-1 together with various adapter proteins. Caspase-1 is important in the synthesis of active IL-1b and IL-18, and induces a type of programmed cell death called pyroptosis. pathogens, its activity needs to be tightly controlled. Excessive caspase-1 activity and thus endotoxic shock was induced in mice given high doses of LPS, but mice deficient in caspase-1, 144 or ASC in another study, 145 were resistant to the lethal effects of LPS. Inflammasome activity has also been linked to the phenomenon of immunoparalysis. Thus, the expression of mRNA encoding the key inflammasome components ASC, NALP1, and caspase-1 was decreased in human monocytes during early septic shock, thought to reflect monocyte deactivation; furthermore, NALP1 mRNA abundance was linked to survival in patients with sepsis. 146 Very little is known about inflammasomes in the veterinary species, although inflammasome assembly mRNAs have been analyzed in the ovine jejunum 147 and induction of inflammasome genes in the spleen was documented in septic pigs infected with either Haemophilus parasuis 148 or Streptococcus suis. 149", "cite_spans": [{"start": 673, "end": 678, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 679, "end": 684, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 685, "end": 690, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 930, "end": 935, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 936, "end": 941, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 942, "end": 947, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pattern Recognition Receptors: an Overview"}, {"text": "After mapping of the gene sequences for human and murine PRRs, exploration of the genomic sequence of other species has allowed the identification of homologs of the majority of TLRs in dogs, 150-154 cats, 49 169, [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] Other PRRs have also been identified in these species, although less is known about them than the TLRs (Table 3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 209, "end": 213, "text": "169,", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 214, "end": 219, "text": "[182]", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 220, "end": 225, "text": "[183]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 226, "end": 231, "text": "[184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 232, "end": 237, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 238, "end": 243, "text": "[186]", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 244, "end": 249, "text": "[187]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 250, "end": 255, "text": "[188]", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 256, "end": 261, "text": "[189]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 262, "end": 267, "text": "[190]", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 268, "end": 273, "text": "[191]", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 386, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "Pattern Recognition Receptors: Veterinary Species"}, {"text": "Toll-like receptors 1-10 have been identified in the bovine genome, 50, 161 with numerous studies documenting their expression in tissues as varied as the endometrium, 38,163 cornea, 158 mammary gland, 167,192 skin, 51 and lung. 168 Whereas most of these studies have utilized PCR techniques to identify TLR expression, 38, 51, 158, 163, 167 an increasing number are employing flow cytometry 192, 193 or immunohistochemistry. 168 TLR signaling in cattle is similar to that described in mice and humans (Fig 2) 162, 192, 194 and the PKR/elF2a pathway appears to be important in bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus infections. 195, 196 Comparatively little is known about the NLR family in cattle, although mRNA encoding NOD 1 and 2 has been identified in bovine mammary tissue. 197, 198 Because of the financial implications of Johne's disease and the currently unconfirmed link between Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease, a number of studies have examined the potential role of polymorphisms of candidate genes-including TLRs-in susceptibility to paratuberculosis. 199 Recently, TLRs 1-10 have also been cloned and sequenced in sheep 48 and goats. 174 Little is currently known about the implication of TLRs in sepsis of ruminants, although the pathways involved in triggering SIRS in sheep appear to be similar to those reported in other species. 169, 200 The impact of infectious agents upon commercial viability of pigs and the contribution of this species to human disease modelling has helped advance the characterization of porcine PRRs. 191 Thus, TLRs 1-10 have been cloned and sequenced [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] ;

[53] [54] [55] Various PCR studies have confirmed the presence of members of the TLR family in both dogs, including TLRs 2, 4, 7, and 9, 61,151-154,223 and cats, including TLRs 1-9. 49, 151, 155, 156 Comparative examination of the canine genome has also identified the presence of genes encoding members of the NLRP family, integral to inflammasome and thus caspase activation. 224 A number of canine TLRs have also been detected by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry. 168, 209, 225, 226 The use of feline models for investigation of human diseases as diverse as type 2 diabetes mellitus and human immunodeficiency virus infection has yielded additional data on PRRs in cats, including the expression of functional TLRs by the endocrine pancreas 155 and modulation of TLR signaling by retroviral pathogens. 156, 227 Enhanced expression of canine TLRs has been observed in clinical cases of osteoarthritis 60 and cystic endometrial hyperplasia/ pyometra 61, 226 ; however, the majority of published research in dogs concerns the expression of PRRs in the intestinal tract, particularly in relation to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 150,223,228 Ongoing research is attempting to identify whether or not certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PRRs can be related to the propensity for particular canine breeds to develop IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. 229- 231 The analysis of SNPs in PRR-encoding genetic sequences is also an exciting field of research in large animals, 164, 213, 232 laying the foundation for the breeding of livestock with enhanced disease resistance and the design of vaccines better able to target dendritic cells. 191, 233 Finally, recent work has documented the expression of an ortholog of human \"triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1\" (TREM-1) by canine neutrophils. 234 Expression of TREM-1 was upregulated by microbial agonists of TLR1/2, TLR2/6, and TLR4/ MD2. 234 This receptor, which has shown promise as a biomarker of sepsis in humans, amplifies pro-inflammatory responses to microbial products. 59, 235 Inflammatory Mediators: Cytokines and Chemokines PRR ligation triggers signaling cascades that culminate in the activation of NF-jB and AP-1 via MyD88 or TICAM1/TRIF (Fig 2) . [236] [237] [238] NF-jB and AP-1 enter the nucleus and activate transcription sites for a variety of genes, including acute phase proteins, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), coagulation factors, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and ILs-1, 6, 8, and 12. The TICAM1/TRIF pathway results in the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3, IRF7), which likewise enter the nucleus and stimulate the transcription of genes encoding interferon (IFN)a, IFNb, and other type 1 IFN-inducible genes. [236] [237] [238] Serum concentrations of TNF-a correlate with death in certain types of human sepsis. 239, 240 Studies of naturally occurring sepsis in veterinary patients have yielded similar results, although this pattern appears not to be universal: increased serum concentrations of TNF-a correlate with mortality in canine parvovirus and neonatal septicemia in cattle and horses, but not in septic cats. 11,241,242 TNF-a is predominantly produced by activated macrophages and T cells-but also by mast cells, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, endothelial cells, myocytes, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts-as a 26 kDa precursor (pro-TNF) expressed on the plasma membrane; there it is cleaved by TNF-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) to yield a 17 kDa soluble form, both the soluble and membrane-bound forms appearing to be active. 243 TNF-a exerts its effects by interaction with one of 2 receptors, TNF receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1, TNFR2). 244, 245 Activation of TNFR1 appears to mediate the proinflammatory and apoptotic pathways associated with inflammation, whereas TNFR2 plays a role in the promotion of tissue repair and angiogenesis. 245 However, the complexity of signaling networks operating in sepsis is underlined by the observation that NF-jB activity induces molecules that block apoptosis mediated by TNFR1, suggesting that integration of the various signals occurs in vivo. 246 Some \"cooperation\" between the 2 receptor types, particularly at low TNF-a concentrations, is also likely and stimulation of both TNFRs leads to further NF-jB and AP-1 release. 244, 247 Many of the classical features of inflammation can be attributed to the actions of TNF-a upon the endothelium, with increased production of iNOS and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) leading to vasodilatation and local slowing of blood flow 248 ; TNF-a also stim-ulates the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). 249, 250 These 3 molecules lead to the tethering of leukocytes to the endothelial wall and their transmigration into the interstitium, accompanied by fluid and plasma macromolecules. 19 There is also evidence for the upregulation of TNF-a and other proinflammatory cytokines in a canine model of sepsis involving the intravenous infusion of low doses of LPS: increased serum concentrations of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 [251] [252] [253] were accompanied in one of the studies by increased expression of pulmonary E-selectin and ICAM-1 and the influx of neutrophils-although whether the LPS induced the expression of the adhesion molecules directly or via induction of the proinflammatory cytokines, or both, remained unclear. 251 A similar phenomenon of up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, has also been observed in cats 254 and horses 255-257 treated with intravenous LPS, as well as the transcription of neutrophil chemoattractants by equine endothelial cells stimulated by Th2 cytokines. 258 Furthermore, concentrations of TNF-a, IL-6, and endotoxin were all higher in the blood and peritoneal fluid of horses with colic than in a healthy control group. 259 The stimulation of feline whole blood with various PAMPs has also elicited the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1b, and CXCL-8. 260 Plasma nitrite and nitrate, oxidation products of NO, have been examined in canine sepsis, in which they were present at higher concentrations than in dogs with SIRS alone. 261 An additional study showed that the inflammatory response to the intravenous administration of LPS, examined by measuring serum concentrations of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6, was mitigated in dogs fed a diet rich in fish oils, suggesting that diet may be an adjunct to conventional antiinflammatory treatment. 262 In addition to the upregulation of iNOS, COX-2, and adhesion molecules, TNF-a also induces the expression of procoagulant proteins such as tissue factor (TF)-and down-regulates anti-coagulant factors such as thrombomodulin-leading to activation of the coagulation cascade. 263 Despite the important role for TNF-a in endothelial activation, experimental evidence suggests that direct stimulation of TLRs expressed by endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells may provide an alternative pathway for the vascular dysfunction seen in sepsis. [264] [265] [266] In addition to TNF-a, NF-jB activation results in the transcription of a number of proinflammatory interleukins, such as IL-1, IL-6, CXCL-8 (IL-8), and IL-12 (Fig 1) . IL-1 acts in a synergistic manner with TNF-a in the \"hyperacute\" period after innate immune stimulation in sepsis. 267, 268 Two proinflammatory forms of IL-1 (IL-1a and IL-1b) have been identified and induce the synthesis of adhesion molecules and cytokines by endothelial cells, encouraging leukocyte activation, endothelial tethering, and transmigration into the interstitium. 269 ,270 IL-1 also upregulates iNOS and COX2 production, acts as the major endogenous pyrogen in fever, and increases corticosteroid release via hypothalamic effects. 269, 271 Another important proinflammatory cytokine in sepsis is IL-6: as well as stimulatory effects upon leukocyte activation and myeloid progenitor cell proliferation, IL-6 also triggers the acute phase response and is a powerful pyrogen. 272,273 Like TNF-a and IL-1, plasma concentrations of IL-6 are increased in sepsis and may be predictive of progression to multiple organ dysfunction and death. 17, 274, 275 Whereas enhanced gene expression of IL-6 correlates with death in septic foals, the opposite relationship appears to hold for serum IL-6 concentrations. 219,276 However, increased serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1b do correlate with death in reports of naturally occurring sepsis in dogs and cats. 11, 13 Serum concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IL-10, also increase in sepsis. 277, 278 This acts not only to inhibit the release of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 from monocytes and macrophages, but also to induce the production of IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP-1) and soluble TNFR, thus reducing circulating concentrations of these cytokines. 279 The critical role of IL-10 in mediating the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory processes can be seen in experimental models: IL-10 knockout mice are profoundly susceptible to sepsis, whereas IL-10 administration prevents these consequences. 280 In clinical situations, however, the pattern appears to be more complex, with increased serum IL-10 concentrations associated with mortality in septic foals and humans, 281,282 but a lower prevalence of feline infectious peritonitis in cats infected with feline coronavirus. 283 Two additional cytokines have recently been identified as being critical in sepsis. Macrophage migratory inhibitory factor (MIF), produced by the anterior pituitary gland, is present at increased concentrations in SIRS and sepsis 284, 285 ; serum concentrations have not only correlated with mortality, but inhibition of MIF appears to be protective. [286] [287] [288] Although the trigger for MIF release in vivo is unclear, it is thought to delay apoptosis of activated monocytes and macrophages, thus helping to perpetuate a proinflammatory state. 288 High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB-1) is an endogenous protein involved in nuclear DNA stabilization. 289 However, after necrotic or apoptotic cell death, it is released into the circulation where it has direct pro-inflammatory actions. 290 In addition, HMGB-1 appears to potentiate the effect of certain PAMPs and DAMPs upon TLR-2, TLR-4, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). 291 HMGB-1 was initially reported as a late inflammatory mediator in sepsis, 292 although ongoing research has highlighted a number of roles in tissue repair and angiogenesis. 293 Circulating concentrations of HMGB-1 appear to correlate with mortality in canine SIRS patients, 294 but were unable to predict hospital mortality in 1 study of septic human patients. 295 The Acute Phase Response", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 57, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 58, "end": 62, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 63, "end": 67, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 235, "end": 238, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 239, "end": 243, "text": "151,", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 244, "end": 248, "text": "155,", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "168,", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "209,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 545, "end": 549, "text": "225,", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 873, "end": 877, "text": "156,", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1022, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "164,", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1567, "text": "213,", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1571, "text": "232", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1727, "text": "191,", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 2126, "end": 2129, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2133, "text": "235", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2315, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2321, "text": "[237]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2327, "text": "[238]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 2877, "end": 2882, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2883, "end": 2888, "text": "[237]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2894, "text": "[238]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2984, "text": "239,", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 3811, "end": 3815, "text": "244,", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 3816, "end": 3819, "text": "245", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4440, "end": 4444, "text": "244,", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 4872, "end": 4876, "text": "249,", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 5288, "end": 5293, "text": "[251]", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 5294, "end": 5299, "text": "[252]", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 5300, "end": 5305, "text": "[253]", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 6385, "end": 6388, "text": "261", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7238, "end": 7243, "text": "[264]", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 7244, "end": 7249, "text": "[265]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7250, "end": 7255, "text": "[266]", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 7539, "end": 7543, "text": "267,", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}, {"start": 7544, "end": 7547, "text": "268", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7970, "end": 7974, "text": "269,", "ref_id": "BIBREF219"}, {"start": 8373, "end": 8376, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 8377, "end": 8381, "text": "274,", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 8688, "end": 8691, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 9825, "end": 9829, "text": "284,", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 9946, "end": 9951, "text": "[286]", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 9952, "end": 9957, "text": "[287]", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 9958, "end": 9963, "text": "[288]", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2300, "end": 2307, "text": "(Fig 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 7414, "end": 7421, "text": "(Fig 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Pattern Recognition Receptors: Veterinary Species"}, {"text": "In addition to the release of cytokines and chemokines from activated immune cells, triggering of PRRs also bring about the release of large quantities of acute phase proteins (APPs) from hepatocytes; these proteins have a variety of functions designed to re-establish homeostasis, assisting in pathogen elimination and subduing inflammation. 296, 297 The acute phase response is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, activation of the coagulation, and complement cascades (classical, alternative, and mannose-binding lectin pathways), serum iron and zinc binding, enhanced gluconeogenesis, increased muscle catabolism, and altered lipid metabolism.

In health, lack of TF exposure within the vascular system and the presence of various circulating proteinssuch as protein C, antithrombin, and tissue factor plasminogen inhibitor-modulate coagulation by the prevention of TF activation. 266, 335 The expression of TF by monocytes or macrophages and tissue parenchymal cells is activated by various inflammatory cytokines, CRP, and PAMPs such as LPS 335,338 -a phenomenon that has also been documented in cats 339 and horses (earlier studies in this species citing \"procoagulant activity\" rather than TF per se). [340] [341] [342] Although findings differ between species, large numbers of TF-expressing microparticles have been identified in blood samples from septic human patients and may correlate with mortality. 343, 344 These microparticles are released from a variety of activated or apoptotic cells-such as platelets, monocytes, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells-and their interaction with endothelial cells and platelets drives the coagulation pathway. [345] [346] [347] Although only an indirect measure, plasma von Willebrand factor concentrations were higher in septic dogs than those in healthy control animals, suggesting that endothelial cell activation also occurs in canine sepsis. 348 Interestingly, platelets enhanced endotoxin-induced equine monocyte TF activity in vitro 341although whether microparticles derived from platelets or other sources play a role in the pathogenesis of equine sepsis in vivo remains unknown. Additional work in an equine model of endotoxemia has shown that large volume resuscitation has no impact on coagulation parameters beyond the changes attributed to endotoxemia, providing useful additional data to inform the treatment of sepsis in this species. 349 Whereas much research has been directed toward the inhibition of coagulation in sepsis, only activated protein C has shown any benefit in human clinical trials. 350, 351 The antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of recombinant human activated protein C led to recommendations for its use in severe sepsis in 2004 352 and 2008, 353 but a recent meta-analysis found no evidence in support of its administration in the treatment of severe sepsis or septic shock. 354 Indeed, there is still debate about its mechanism of action and, as yet, little experience of its use in veterinary medicine, despite encouraging pharmacological data in experimental models. 266, 355, 356 In addition to the role of TF in initiating coagulation in the presence of inflammation, activated platelets and endothelial cells-as well as bacterial surfaces-also trigger the contact phase system, leading to the formation of kallikrein and bradykinin. 357, 358 Bradykinin in turn enhances vasodilatation and increases vascular permeability, as well as reducing platelet function 359 ; kallikrein accelerates fibrinolysis by conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and causes additional activation of Factor XII, leading to stimulation of the classical complement pathway. 360, 361 A final connection between coagulation and inflammation in sepsis has become apparent with the recent exploration of the role of \"a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type-I motifs-13\" (ADAMTS-13). ADAMTS-13 is produced by the stellate (Ito) cells of the liver and acts to cleave ultra-large von Willebrand's Factor (vWF) multimers into smaller multimers. 362 These ultra-large vWF multimers are released from endothelial stores after inflammation and lead to platelet activation and aggregation; the ensuing microthrombi further compromise tissue blood flow, leading to additional propagation of the proinflammatory state. 363 Although not yet identified in clinical veterinary species, decreased plasma ADAM-TS-13 activity is associated with a poor prognosis in human sepsis patients [364] [365] [366] ; decreased activity is attributed to both a diminution of hepatic production and an increase in breakdown by plasma proteases. 366 The Compensatory Anti-Inflammatory Response Syndrome and Cell Death", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 322, "text": "[335]", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 323, "end": 328, "text": "[336]", "ref_id": "BIBREF272"}, {"start": 329, "end": 334, "text": "[337]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 739, "end": 743, "text": "266,", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1069, "text": "[340]", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1075, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1081, "text": "[342]", "ref_id": "BIBREF278"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1273, "text": "343,", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1521, "text": "[345]", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1527, "text": "[346]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1533, "text": "[347]", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2260, "text": "349", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2422, "end": 2426, "text": "350,", "ref_id": "BIBREF285"}, {"start": 2926, "end": 2930, "text": "266,", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 2931, "end": 2935, "text": "355,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3195, "end": 3199, "text": "357,", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}, {"start": 3512, "end": 3516, "text": "360,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4331, "end": 4336, "text": "[364]", "ref_id": "BIBREF297"}, {"start": 4337, "end": 4342, "text": "[365]", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 4343, "end": 4348, "text": "[366]", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 316, "text": "Fig 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "The Interaction of Inflammation and Coagulation in Sepsis"}, {"text": "Ongoing investigation of the molecular mechanisms of the SIRS response, as well as the notable failure of therapeutic blockade of proinflammatory mediators, led to the realization that the mortality associated with sepsis could not be explained solely by an uncontrollable \"cytokine storm\". 367, 368 This resulted in the concept of an opposing \"compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome\" (CARS), thought to be an adaptive response to the excessive proinflammatory process in SIRS and sepsis. 367, 369 Whereas an appropriate balance is struck in the vast majority of instances of host-defense challenge, this is lost in sepsis-leading either to an uncontrolled proinflammatory reaction to infection, resulting in organ dysfunction, an undesirable compromise of the immune system permitting opportunistic infection (the \"second hit\"), or a combination of both. 367 In the absence of inflammation, various anticoagulant mechanisms exist to prevent activation of coagulation. Thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor interact with thrombin to activate protein C (aPC), which in turn interacts with protein S to inactivate factor V. Endothelial cells also express tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin on their luminal surface and secrete tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However, the majority of these anticoagulant factors are negative acute phase proteins and thus plasma concentrations falling during sepsis. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines released during sepsis activate endothelial cells, platelets and circulating white blood cells, which begin to express tissue factor (TF) and lose surface anticoagulant proteins. Microparticle formation is increased, together with expression of functional adhesion molecules on platelets, microparticles, monocytes and endothelial cells. Plasma antithrombin, aPC, protein S, and TFPI concentrations fall; ADAMTS-13 activity also drops, leading to greater persistence of ultralarge von Willebrand factor, which further enhances platelet and microparticle activation and adhesion. After triggering of the contact activation (TF) pathway, the interaction of microparticles with endothelial cells and platelets further drives the coagulation pathway. The presence of coagulation pathway components (TF-VIIa complex, Xa, Va, thrombin) and other circulating proteases activates endothelial protease-activated receptors (PARs), which propagate the inflammatory process by stimulating the further release of mediators (TNFa, IL-6 and CXCL-8), platelet activation and cell death.

Apoptotic cells were observed in the liver, kidney, thymus, stomach, and lymphocyte population of endotoxemic piglets 395 and the primary and secondary lymphoid organs of pigs infected with classical swine fever virus. 396 LPS and TNF-a both induced apoptosis of bovine glomerular endothelial cells, modeling a potential pathomechanism of acute renal failure in Gram-negative sepsis 397 ; this phenomenon could be potently inhibited by glucocorticoids in vitro. 398 Haemophilus somnus, a Gram-negative pathogen of cattle that causes sepsis and vasculitis, induces caspases 3 and 8, and subsequent apoptosis, of endothelial cells in vitro 399 ; furthermore, the bacterium stimulates platelets that are in turn able to induce endothelial cell apoptosis by a contact-dependent mechanism involving the activation of caspases 8 and 9 and the synthesis of reactive oxygen species. 400 The activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 and the expression of phosphorylated Paxillin showed positive correlation with cardiomyocyte apoptosis in an ovine model of endotoxemic shock, 401 whereas apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and splenocytes of sheep infected with bluetongue virus was thought to contribute to immunosuppression in this disease. 402 Ileal epithelial apoptosis was documented in one feline model of endotoxemia, 403 although a second demonstrated lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleen and Peyer's patches. 334 Apoptosis of T cells also contributes to the immunosuppression characteristic of feline immunodeficiency virus infection. 404 Finally, apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was observed in a canine model of sepsis induced by the intravenous infusion of E. coli. 405", "cite_spans": [{"start": 900, "end": 904, "text": "376,", "ref_id": "BIBREF304"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1448, "text": "380,", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1589, "text": "382,", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2268, "text": "386,", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2517, "text": "388,", "ref_id": "BIBREF314"}, {"start": 2715, "end": 2719, "text": "386,", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1323, "end": 1331, "text": "(ABIN-3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "The Interaction of Inflammation and Coagulation in Sepsis"}, {"text": "One of the key features of the adaptive immune system is its ability to generate antigen-specific receptors with an enormous diversity of specificities, some of which may recognize host-derived epitopes. 406, 407 The majority of potentially autoaggressive thymocytes are deleted in the thymic medulla in a process called negative selection. 408, 409 However, this process of central tolerance is imperfect and underlines the importance of a number of peripheral tolerance mechanisms, including clonal deletion, functional inactivation (anergy), and phenotypic skewing. 410-412 Although a subject of debate for many years, a population of Tregs is now known to play a major role in peripheral tolerance, complementing the preceding (intrinsic) mechanisms.

[455] [456] [457] Naturally occurring Tregs have been identified by their constitutive expression of the IL-2 receptor a chain (CD25) and Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in both their ontogeny and peripheral function. FOXP3 acts to stabilize the Treg transcriptome by repressing a number of pro-inflammatory and growthpromoting genes-for example, IL-2 and IFNG-while activating others encoding key molecules involved in Treg function-for example, CTLA4 and CD25. 458, 459 Naturally occurring Tregs are known to interact with cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems-including monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, mast cells, dendritic cells, and both T and B cells-generally mediating a suppressive function to prevent the development of autoaggressive responses and maintain the population of peripheral CD4 + T cells, thus contributing to immune system homeostasis. 456, 460, 461 Tregs are also known to express a variety of TLRs, stimulation of which has augmented or abolished regulatory function in various studies. [462] [463] [464] [465] The molecular mechanisms of immune suppression mediated by naturally occurring Tregs have not been fully elucidated, but involve cell contactdependent interactions, induction of cell death, and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-b. 416, 456 Various studies have documented increased proportions of Tregs in human sepsis during the phase of immunoparalysis, [466] [467] [468] [469] but the role of this change remains unclear because depletion of Tregs in murine models of sepsis has yielded variable conclusions between models, either improving, enhancing, or bearing no influence on mortality. [470] [471] [472] Given the ability of Tregs to induce the alternative activation pathway of macrophages 473 and to inhibit the LPS-induced survival of monocytes through a proapoptotic mechanism involving the Fas/FasL pathway, 474 they may make a potentially significant contribution to immune system dysfunction in human septic patients, 468, 469, 475, 476 although this is still a controversial area. 477 Additional research is required to elucidate the role of Tregs in sepsis, as well as to identify their mechanisms of action in this context. Moreover, to the authors' knowledge no veterinary studies have interrogated Treg number or function in septic patients to date. Pharmacological manipulation of Treg activity continues to be explored experimentally and may eventually translate to clinical cases; however, therapeutic interventions to alter the resistance of immune cells to Treg suppression may prove an equally valid alternative approach. 478, 479 Conclusions As is apparent from Figure 1 , a broad concept of the immunopathological mechanisms underlying sepsis is now generally accepted. However, many of the molecular details are both complex and incompletely elucidated. Ongoing research has also indicated the existence of multiple redundant pathways within the innate immune response, potentially explaining the failure of many highly selective therapeutic interventions. 14, 19 A single \"magic bullet\" for the treatment of sepsis is highly unlikely to exist: an individually tailored set of therapies, based on point-of-care assessment of the immunopathological status of the patient, is the likely future-albeit a distant one. 373 Various human studies have resulted in the publication of consensus statements regarding the treatment of sepsis, 352,353 but current veterinary evidence to substantiate these interventions is thin on the ground. What has become evident is that outside the experimental laboratory, the heterogeneous nature of the septic patient population means that clinical trials must be carefully designed to obtain meaningful data. [480] [481] [482] Ongoing basic research into the immunopathology of sepsis in clinical veterinary species is equally important, to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and thus direct clinical studies to those aspects of disease likely to benefit the greatest number of patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 204, "end": 208, "text": "406,", "ref_id": "BIBREF328"}, {"start": 209,

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. The cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of the TLRs interacts with TIR-domain-containing adaptors, such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), TIR-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1, also known as TRIF) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM2, also known as TRAM). PAMP binding to the respective receptor results in the activation of either the MyD88 or TICAM1/TRIF signaling pathways. These pathways involve a series of kinases in the IL-1R associated kinase (IRAK) family, whose action eventually results in activation of the inhibitor of j B kinase (IKK) enzyme complex and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitory IjBa protein, thus freeing the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB); triggering of the MAPK signaling pathway results in the activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1). Both NF-jB and AP-1 then initiate the transcription of cytokine genes. Abbreviations: TRAF = TNF receptor-associated factor; RIP = receptor interacting protein; TAK = TGF-b-activated kinase; NEMO = NF-jB essential modulator; TBK = TRAF family member-associated NF-jB activator (TANK)-binding kinase; IRF = interferon regulatory factor.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Fig 3. Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing protein (NLR) signaling pathways. Upon PAMP ligation, NLRs recruit the serine-threonine kinase RIP-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein (CLARP) kinase (RICK), also known as receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2 or RIP2), which binds to NF-jB essential modulator (NEMO), a subunit of IKK, resulting in the phosphorylation of IjB and the release of NF-jB; RICK also mediates the recruitment of transforming growth factor b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and together these molecules stimulate activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In common with the TLR family, NLR activation leads to the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes via the mobilization of NF-jB and AP-1. Another important consequence of NLR ligation is activation of the inflammasome, a macromolecular complex comprising pro-caspase-1 together with various adapter proteins.
