S is a trimeric class I viral fusion protein that is proteolytically 29 processed into S1 and S2 subunits that remain noncovalently associated in a prefusion 30 state (8, 11, 14) . Upon engagement of ACE2 by a receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (15), 31 conformational rearrangements occur that cause S1 shedding, cleavage of S2 by host 32 proteases, and exposure of a fusion peptide adjacent to the S2' proteolysis site (14, (16) (17) (18) . 33 Favorable folding of S to a post-fusion conformation is coupled to host cell/virus 34 membrane fusion and cytosolic release of viral RNA. Atomic contacts with the RBD are 35 restricted to the protease domain of ACE2 (19, 20) , and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) in which the 36 transmembrane domain is removed is sufficient for binding S and neutralizing infection 37 (12, (21) (22) (23) (24) . In principle, the virus has limited potential to escape sACE2-mediated 38 neutralization without simultaneously decreasing affinity for native ACE2 receptors, 39 thereby attenuating virulence. Furthermore, fusion of sACE2 to the Fc region of human 40 immunoglobulin can provide an avidity boost while recruiting immune effector functions 41 and increasing serum stability, an especially desirable quality if intended for prophylaxis 42 (23, 25) , and sACE2 has proven safe in healthy human subjects (26) and patients with lung 43 disease (27). Recombinant sACE2 is being evaluated in a European phase II clinical trial for 44 COVID-19 managed by Apeiron Biologics, and peptide derivatives of ACE2 are also being 45 explored as cell entry inhibitors (28). 46",

The mature polypeptide (a.a. 19-805) of human ACE2 (GenBank NM_021804.1) 320 was cloned in to the NheI-XhoI sites of pCEP4 (Invitrogen) with a N-terminal HA leader 321 (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA), myc-tag, and linker (GSPGGA). Soluble ACE2 fused to superfolder 322 GFP (34) was constructed by genetically joining the protease domain (a.a. 1-615) of ACE2 323 to sfGFP (GenBank ASL68970) via a gly/ser-rich linker (GSGGSGSGG), and pasting between 324 the NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Equivalent sACE2 constructs were cloned 325 with a GSG linker and 8 histidine tag, or a GS linker and the Fc region of IgG1 (a.a. D221-326 K447). A synthetic human codon-optimized gene fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies) 327 for the RBD (a.a. 333-529) of SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank YP_009724390.1) was N-terminally 328 fused to a HA leader and C-terminally fused to either superfolder GFP, the Fc region of IgG1 329 or a 8 histidine tag. Assembled DNA fragments were ligated in to the NheI-XhoI sites of 330 pcDNA3.1(+). Human codon-optimized full length S was subcloned from pUC57-2019-331 nCoV-S(Human) (Molecular Cloud), both untagged (a.a. 1-1273) and with a N-terminal HA 332 leader (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA), myc-tag and linker (GSPGGA) upstream of the mature 333 polypeptide (a.a. 16-1273). 334 Tissue Culture. Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) were cultured in Expi293 Expression 335 Medium (ThermoFisher) at 125 rpm, 8 % CO2, 37 \u00b0C. For production of RBD-sfGFP, RBD-336IgG1, sACE2-8h and sACE2-IgG1, cells were prepared to 2 \u00d7 10 6 / ml. Per ml of culture, 500 337 ng of plasmid and 3 \u00b5g of polyethylenimine (MW 25,000; Polysciences) were mixed in 100 338\u00b5l of OptiMEM (Gibco), incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature, and added to cells. 339",
