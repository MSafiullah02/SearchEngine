Understanding the behaviours of HCW, including the wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), is therefore important in COVID-19 prevention. In this regard, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified education as one of the most important components of prevention programs [4]. Experts also believe that one of the reasons for the failure of educational programs is the lack of attention to analytical studies and their inability to consider psycho-social models as an intellectual framework in educational planning. Among the theories that have been used in various studies to predict protective behaviours is the Protective Motivation Theory (PMT) [5].",

[8]. By contrast, Rajoura et al. reported that 82.6% of physicians and 85% of Indian nurses used masks in their workplace at the time of the epidemic H1N1 influenza [9].

As a result, 35.5% of participants were on the fear control path. Considering the assumptions of the PMT, first, the threat is assessed in terms of severity. Next, by increasing the perceived threat, a second evaluation is motivated on the effectiveness of the recommended strategies. In this situation, in addition to evaluating the effectiveness of recommended strategies, the individuals also evaluate their level of effectiveness. When the threat is not considered seriously (low perceived susceptibility and severity), there is a low motivation to focus on the subject, making people superficially evaluate the effectiveness of recommended strategies. In other words, if people do not grasp the threat and do not understand its severity, they will easily ignore the relevant available information. In contrast, similar to the findings of the present study, despite the perceived threat, when people find the recommended strategy ineffective with low self-efficacy, or find themselves unable to act against the recommended strategy and to prevent a serious threat, the fear control process will prevail over the danger control process [5]. Considering the findings of the present study, increasing the perceived efficacy of protective behaviours against COVID-19 by HCW is recommended as an educational priority.",
