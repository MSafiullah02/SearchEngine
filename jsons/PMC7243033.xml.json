On one hand, climate change results in droughts, heat waves, tornadoes, storms etc; movement of the tectonic plates is responsible for earthquakes and volcano eruptions. On the other hand, certain aspects of human activities may crash stock markets, influence tensions not only among groups of people in a country, but also between countries sometimes leading to military confrontations and mass migrations, etc. While there is no single definition of extreme events [1], they are considered events that cause infrastructure failures, economic and property losses, risk to health and life.",

For instance, Modified Mercalli Intensity scale [2] (describes the intensity of visible damage of earthquakes), Beaufort Wind scale [3] (measures speed and observed effects the wind has on the sea and land), Saffir-Simpsons Hurricane scale [4] (measures wind speed), Fujita scale [5] (rates the intensity of a tornado after it has passed), US Homeland Security Terror Alert scale [6] (measures five color-coded terror alert levels), U.S. Climate Extremes Index [7], etc. Rohn Emergency Scale [8] unites emergency scales using three independent dimensions: (i) scope; (ii) topographical change (or lack thereof); and (iii) speed of change. The intersection of the three dimensions provides a detailed scale for defining any emergency [8]. In some papers, the threshold for an extreme event is related to the number of standard deviations from the average amplitude [9], [10]. However, existing empirical scales tend to describe the characteristics of the event itself rather that the consequences; such scales are ill-suited to describe emergencies in a way that is meaningful for response [11].",

Unlike the Richter magnitude scale, the severity of flash crashes in financial markets is defined by the measures that need to be taken to ease panic such as halting trading. Under 2012 rules, market-wide circuit breakers (or \u2019curbs\u2019) kick in when the S&P 500 index drops 7% for Level 1; 13% for Level 2; and 20% for Level 3 from the prior days close. A market decline that triggers a Level 1 or 2 circuit breaker before 3:25 p.m. Eastern Time will halt trading for 15 minutes, but will not halt trading at or after 3:25 p.m. Circuit breakers can also be imposed on single stocks as opposed to the whole market. Under current rules, a trading halt on an individual security is placed into effect if there is a 10% change in value of a security that is a member of the S&P 500 Index within a 5-minute time frame, 30% change in value of a security whose price is equal or greater than $1 per share, and 50% change in value of a security whose price is less than $1 per share [14]. Ironically, in August 2015, single stock circuit breakers produced unprecedented disruption as 327 exchange-traded funds experienced more than 1000 trading halts during a single day.",

The choice of the threshold over which to fit a probability distribution is hard and arbitrary. Although tools to guide this choice exist, inference can greatly vary for different thresholds. In addition to that, different distributions may admit asymptotic tails of the same appearance (a power law).

For instance, as of March 25, 2020, 414, 179 cases and 18, 440 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had been reported worldwide [16]. In attempts to slow down spread of the disease, the economies of many counties slammed brakes and financial markets plummeted in the light of uncertainty, but the above does not describe severity of this particular extreme event, but rather, a reaction of the mankind to COVID-19. One natural characteristic of severity of pandemic is death rate, which in case of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 0.66% [17] to 4% [18]. Mortality rate is higher among people with underlying medical conditions, sometimes, deaths partly occur due to coronavirus. Therefore, some believe that this pandemic is poised to be more dramatic than anything we have seen in our lifetimes [19], but other compare the situation to an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies [20].",

In addition to that, assessment of the severity of the extreme event is also ruled by consequences, which may be revealed ex post facto. In Sec. 4.3 we presented statistics of extreme events under threshold uncertainty. We analyzed the degree of uncertainty of the threshold value (chosen with the rule of thumb) based on the probability of its change at any given day. Fig. 16 demonstrates the degree of uncertainty that depends on both the amount of data available and the values of thresholds. We observed several cases:(i)If the amount of data is not sufficient (a solid line corresponding to an 18-day window of obervation in Fig. 16), then the uncertainty curve forms a skewed profile attaining a single maximum for some value of the threshold. In this situation, an observer\u2019s perception of events reminds Red Queen from \u201cThrough The Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\u201d by Lewis Carroll [21] who said \u201cWhen you say hill, I could show you hills, in comparison with which you\u2019d call that a valley\u201d. Our understanding of the events whether they are extreme or not is very limited and uncertainty is blurry. As events become more severe, our uncertainty that the events are extreme decreases. The observer realizes that the events are extreme, but a precise point at which the events turn to be severe cannot be determined. This case is called the Red Queen State.(ii)As the window of observation becomes larger, the uncertainty curve exhibits two maxima indicating that the amount of data is sufficient. As we further extend the window the curve torrents into sharp peaks (Fig. 16). The latter ones clearly separate the threshold values into three regions: three levels of emergency.\n(I)In the region I (subcritical), the threshold values are small to raise concern about extreme events. Then we can observe a spike with the degree of uncertainty attaining its first maximum. This extremum indicates a transition to the next kind of uncertainty.(II)In the region II (critical), uncertainty is conceptualized with a question whether a magnitude of the event is already critical, extreme or not yet. Further, we see another jump of uncertainty. At this point we certain that events are not regular anymore.(III)We consider all events in this region extreme with our uncertainty decreasing. If these events are not extreme then what are they?\n",

The larger Hurst exponent is visually seen as more slow evolving variations (i.e., more persistent structure) of the time series [26], [28], [29]. Processes with 0 < H < 0.5 exhibit antipersistence, with an increase in the process is likely to be followed by a decrease in the next time interval resulting in sample paths with a very rough structure [26], [28], [29]. On the contrary, values 0.5 < H < 1 lead to long-range dependence (\u201clong memory\u201d) in the time series, with more likely the same sign of successive increments (persistence) and smoother sample trajectories. Finally, the time series constitutes random walks when H > 1 that have more apparent slow evolving fluctuations [26], [28], [29]. The q-order Hurst exponent Hq is only one of several types of scaling exponents used to parameterize the multifractal structure of time series [26], [30].",

Generalizations of the Gumbel distribution, which are of flexible skewness and kurtosis due to the addition of one more shape parameter are widely used for extreme value data as they better fit data [40]. The distribution in (4.1) has been employed as a model for extreme values [41], [42].

This modeling is based on the GPD that is suitable for describing properties of excesses. The mean excess (ME) function is one of the most common tools to determine a suitable threshold u. The ME function of a random variable X is defined as(4.5)M(u)=E(X\u2212u|X>u),provided EX+<+\u221e, which is also known as mean residual life function. As Ghosh [47] noted for a random variable X \u2248 G\n\u03be,\u03b2, E(X)<+\u221e if and only if \u03be < 1 and in this case, the ME function of X is linear in u:(4.6)M(u)=\u03b21\u2212\u03be+\u03be1\u2212\u03beu,where 0\u2264u<+\u221e if \u03be \u2208 [0, 1) and u\u2208[0,\u2212\u03b2\u03be] if \u03be < 0. The linearity of the ME function characterizes the GPD class [47]. Davison and Smith [46] developed a simple graphical tool that checks data against a GPD model. Let X1\u2265X2\u2265\u2026\u2265Xn be the order statistics of the data, then ME plot depicts the points {Xk,M^(Xk)|1<k\u2264n}, where M^ is the empirical ME function defined as(4.7)M^(u)=\u2211i=1n(Xi\u2212u)I[Xi>u]\u2211i=1nI[Xi>u],u\u22650.If the ME plot is close to linear for sufficiently large values of the threshold then there is no evidence against use of a GPD model. Another problem is to obtain a natural estimation \u03be^ of \u03be. There are several methods to estimate \u03be^, such as: (i) Least squares [44], (ii) Maximum likelihood estimation [46], (iii) the Hill estimator [49], (iv) the Pickands estimator [55], (v) quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot) [44], (vi) the moment estimator [56].",

In the model of extreme events under threshold uncertainty, the current value of the log-return is quantified by a random number x \u2208 [0, 1] drawn accordingly some probability distribution function Pr{x<z}=F(z). The threshold value that might change any time once the new data become available is another random number y \u2208 [0, 1], which is drawn from another probability distribution function, Pr{y<z}=G(z). We assume that the rate of daily variations of the log-return values is greater than or equal to that of the threshold values, ultimately determining whether the current log-return value is extreme or not.

In this situation, an observer\u2019s perception of the events reminds Red Queen from \u201cThrough The Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\u201d by Lewis Carroll [21] who said \u201cWhen you say hill, I could show you hills, in comparison with which you\u2019d call that a valley\u201d. Our understanding of the events whether they are extreme or not is very limited and uncertainty is blurry. As events become more severe, our uncertainty that the events are extreme decreases. The observer realizes that the events are extreme, but a precise point at which the events turn to be severe cannot be determined. This case is called the Red Queen State.(ii)As the window of observation becomes larger, 25 days, for instance, the uncertainty curve exhibits two maxima indicating that the amount of data is sufficient. This happens because H(\u03b7) attains its maximum for \u03b7=1/2 and the \u03b7 curve admits a value 1/2 twice (Fig. 14). As we further extend the window the curve torrents into sharp peaks (Fig. 16). The latter ones clearly separate the threshold values into three regions: three levels of emergency. The locations of peaks of the curves are summarized in Table 2\n. The location of two peaks is not sensitive to the window of observation.\n",
