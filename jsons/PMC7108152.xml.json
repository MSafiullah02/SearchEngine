            "text": "The reported incidence of pertussis has been increasing in the United States despite high coverage with pertussis-containing vaccines [2\u20134]. While the changing epidemiology of pertussis and several factors that contribute to the US resurgence have been described, fewer data exist on the current burden and characteristics of severe disease, especially in age groups outside of infancy. Our comprehensive analysis of 5 years of EPS data suggests that individuals at the extreme ends of life may be the most vulnerable to severe pertussis infections; 27% of pertussis patients aged <1 year and 12% of patients aged \u226565 years in our analysis were hospitalized for their pertussis infection. Understanding the spectrum of severe illness across all age groups is necessary for identifying additional populations at increased risk that could benefit from targeted vaccination or post-exposure prophylaxis.",

Although infants aged <2 months account for less than 2% of all pertussis cases in our analysis overall, they account for approximately 30% of pertussis-related hospitalizations. Among those who are hospitalized, they represent more than 50% of ICU admissions and have the highest rates of advanced medical interventions such as mechanical ventilation, ECMO, or exchange transfusion. Interestingly, we found that infants aged <2 months who had received a macrolide antibiotic within 14 days of symptom onset had an increased risk of hospitalization. While we had hypothesized that delayed initiation of antibiotic treatment may increase the risk of severe disease, this finding, along with the relatively short delay between symptom onset and hospitalization relative to older age groups, may be an indicator of severe symptoms upon presentation at a healthcare facility or a more rapid progression to severe illness in this age group.",

The association of hospitalization and multiple physician visits prior to a diagnosis of pertussis, along with the increasing delay from symptom onset to hospitalization with age, further suggest missed opportunities for diagnosis and treatment in these age groups, which may have contributed to illness severity. Potentially serious respiratory complications were reported among hospitalized patients across these older age groups, including admission diagnoses that reflected the need for a higher level of care (eg, respiratory distress or failure, hypoxia, apnea), high rates of pneumonia, and viral codetections (eg, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza), that could potentially exacerbate a pertussis infection. However, in some hospitalized patients, the severity of illness was not as clearly perceived from the data abstracted from the chart review. In addition, several of the states with the highest incidence had the lowest hospitalization rates, and vice versa. This suggests that other factors, such as differences in hospitalization practices, thresholds for admission, burden of disease, and differences in surveillance systems\u2019 detection of less severe cases, may all contribute and that use of hospitalization as a proxy for severe illness may overestimate the burden of severe cases across age groups.",

            "text": "Although the role of underlying medical conditions in the development of severe pertussis infections is not well understood, the high proportion of hospitalized adolescent and adult cases with underlying conditions suggests that they may be a contributing factor. Consistent with previous evaluations that have suggested asthma as a risk factor for pertussis [15, 16], we found high rates of asthma in hospitalized patients in our evaluation. Forty-four percent of hospitalized adolescents aged 12 to 20 years and approximately 26% of hospitalized adults aged \u226521 years had a history of asthma compared to approximately 10% of US adolescents and 8% of adults [17]. We also found higher than average rates of COPD, with 19% of hospitalized pertussis patients aged \u226521 years compared to 6.4% among US adults with a history of COPD [18]. Although 1 study demonstrated higher serum levels of anti-B. pertussis immunoglobulin G in persons with COPD [19], the risk of pertussis, including severe pertussis, in persons with COPD is unknown. Not only did a high proportion of patients report a history of asthma or COPD, these conditions appear to have played a role in their clinical severity, as asthma and/or COPD exacerbation were listed as a leading reason for hospital admission in adolescents and adults. In addition, high proportions of hospitalized adolescents aged 12 to 20 years in our evaluation had underlying neurologic, genetic, or potentially immunocompromising conditions, suggesting that of the few adolescents who are hospitalized for their pertussis infection, many have complex medical histories. This high rate of neurologic and genetic underlying conditions may help provide context for the higher rates of certain pertussis-related complications, such as new-onset seizures and encephalopathy, observed in adolescents compared to other age groups. As we did not have a comparison group, we are unable to determine whether certain underlying conditions are risk factors for severe pertussis or, rather, whether persons with these conditions are hospitalized at greater rates due to a perception of increased risk for severe disease.",

Consistent with findings from a previous US study [20], our results demonstrate that infants aged <2 months with pertussis infection whose mothers received Tdap during the third trimester of pregnancy had a 49% reduced risk of hospitalization compared to infant pertussis cases with unvaccinated mothers. In addition, a case-control study among pertussis patients age <2 months with matched healthy controls demonstrated that maternal Tdap receipt during the third trimester was 90.5% effective against hospitalization with pertussis [21]. Among older infants and children, the risk of hospitalization in our analysis was reduced by 43% in 2- to 11-month-olds, and 66% in 1- to 10-year-olds who were up to date on pertussis vaccination. Although high amounts of missing vaccination information in adolescents and adults precluded our ability to fully assess this association in older age groups, a recent publication suggested that adolescents and adults vaccinated with Tdap have reduced incidence of post-tussive vomiting, a marker of more clinically significant illness [22]. Thus, although vaccinated persons may still remain at risk for pertussis infection, these data highlight the role that pertussis vaccination plays in the prevention of severe and potentially life-threating infections, suggesting an added benefit of vaccination that goes beyond disease prevention.",

Continued monitoring of pertussis hospitalizations through enhanced surveillance systems such as EPS will help better define populations at increased risk of severe disease in order to appropriately target and prioritize current and future pertussis prevention and control strategies.",
