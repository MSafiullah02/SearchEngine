            "text": "Almost all cells express germ-line encoded sensors with the ability to recognise virus infections and to initiate defence systems necessary to limit virus spread and pathogenicity. In technical terms, a sensor is \u2018a device that detects events or changes in quantities and provides a corresponding output without affecting the original trigger\u2019. Sensors follow certain rules that include selective sensitivity to a specific measured property and insensitivity to other properties likely to be encountered. In analogy to technical terms, virus sensors convert a signal (virus infection) to an output that instructs the cell to take further actions. The magnitude of its activation is characterised by properties related to the exact nature and the quantity of the trigger. The targets of these sensors can be incoming virus particles [1], particular viral proteins [2] as well as general integrity of the cell [3]. However, the yet best understood sensors involved in antiviral defence are activated by viral nucleic acids [4]. Endosomal Toll-like receptors sample the extracellular milieu or cytoplasmic contents that are delivered into endosomes through autophagy. In this review we concentrate on intracellular nucleic acid sensors and effector proteins that evolved to mediate specialised tasks including, firstly, expression of cytokines such as type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2); secondly, modulation of cellular machineries required for virus replication and thirdly, direct inhibition of virus growth (Figure 1\n). Induction of cytokines utilises at least two distinct pathways either involving the adaptor proteins mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) or stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Activation of either pathway regulates transcription of cytokines, which are key signals to shape adaptive immunity to induce an intracellular \u2018antiviral state\u2019 characterised by expression of antiviral defence proteins. Some of the latter proteins are activated by viral nucleic acids and in turn re-wire cellular machineries to limit virus spread. Other proteins directly bind viral nucleic acid and impair functionality through steric hindrance or degradation.",

            "text": "To understand how viral nucleic acids are sensed by the innate immune system it is important to consider the different types of nucleic acids generated after virus infection. Viruses are intracellular pathogens that require cellular translation and host metabolism, but provide their own replication machinery. Independence of the host for multiplication of viral genomes allows high replication rates, which is often associated with pathogenicity [5]. 24\u201348 hours after infection approximately 25% of RNA can be of viral origin (P. Hubel and A. Meiler, unpublished). Viral nucleic acids accumulate in compartments typically devoid of cellular nucleic acids and often possess or lack modifications or physical properties that are not normally associated with cellular RNA or DNA (Figure 2\n). RNA polymerases commonly generate RNA with a 5\u2032 triphosphate group (PPP-RNA). Cellular RNA polymerases co-transcriptionally modify newly synthesised RNA at the 5\u2032 terminus. In case of mRNA an inverted guanine nucleotide cap is added and methylated at the N7-position as well as the 2\u2032O position of the first ribose of the RNA strand (Cap1 mRNA) (Figure 2) [6]. These modifications are necessary to mark mRNA for further processing and export into the cytoplasm, where translation takes place. Other cellular RNAs are cleaved and have a 5\u2032 monophosphate in case of transfer (t)RNA, most ribosomal (r)RNAs and small nucleolar (sno) RNAs [7]. Some small RNAs bear a terminally methylated 5\u2032 triphosphate (U6 snRNA, 7SK RNA) or are further processed to a hypermethylated 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap (TMG) cap (snRNAs). In addition, more than 100 modifications on internal nucleotides of cellular RNAs have been described, some of which are critical to tame activation of the innate immune system. Total cellular RNA isolated from cells and transfected into indicator cells does not activate the innate immune system, whereas the products of most viral RNA polymerases are strong stimuli of antiviral responses [8]. Negative strand RNA viruses such as orthomyxo-viruses, paramyxo-viruses and bunyaviruses commonly generate full-length genomic PPP-RNA and short 5\u2032 PPP subgenomic RNA, which have strong immunostimulatory potential [4]. To avoid the cellular defence system many viruses mimic cellular mRNA-like cap structures by encoding capping enzymes (e.g. Flaviviruses, Coronaviruses, Poxviruses, and Reoviruses), \u2018steal\u2019 cap structures from cellular mRNAs for their transcripts (e.g. Orthomyxoviruses, Bunayviruses) or trim their genomic RNA to display only monophosphorylated termini (Bunyaviruses, Bornaviruses) [9, 10]. Picornaviruses and Caliciviruses mask their RNA with a covalently 5\u2032 genome-linked viral protein (VpG). In addition to the cap itself, 2\u2032O methylation of the first ribose of mRNAs is an additional modification that is highly conserved between viruses and their hosts, evidenced by the presence of dedicated viral proteins that catalyse this reaction [10]. Lack of 2\u2032O methylation renders viruses highly vulnerable to the antiviral activity of the interferon system [11, 12].",

            "text": "A type of RNA often associated with viral replication is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA could be either the result of replication intermediates (for RNA viruses), generation of genomic RNA (for dsRNA viruses), convergent transcription (for DNA viruses), or of the presence of secondary structures found in viral RNAs (e.g. the IRES structure of ssRNA viruses) [5]. However, the definition and exact nature of dsRNA still remains enigmatic. Using an antibody raised against dsRNA, it was found that such RNA is produced in cells infected with DNA viruses as well as some RNA viruses, such as Flavi and Picornaviruses [8]. However, although double-strandedness is an important feature recognised by virus sensors, it does not seem to be the only important determinant to stimulate fulminant antiviral responses since different double-stranded homopolymers vary considerably in their ability to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Furthermore, dsRNA is commonly generated by convergent transcription of cellular RNA polymerases and is involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing [13\u2022, 14]. Despite the presence of cell-generated dsRNA no spontaneous synthesis of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is apparent nor is transfection of total cellular RNA containing detectable dsRNA molecules or plasmid-based convergent transcription capable to induce significant levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 [13\u2022]. A possible explanation for the lack of stimulatory activity of cellular RNA may be insufficient concentration of dsRNA as proposed by a recent study showing that nuclear dsRNA is digested by the endonuclease Dicer [15]. It may be that the latter function is used by orthomyxoviruses that replicate in the nucleus to reduce the abundance of viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm.",

However, simple compartmentalisation is insufficient to explain the ability of the innate immune system to recognise DNA viruses that replicate the nucleus [16\u2022].

The founding member of this family, Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) bears two N-terminal Caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) required for signalling, a central helicase domain that mediates binding to dsRNA and a C-terminal repressor domain, which binds 5\u2032 tri-phosphorylated, di-phosphorylated or dephosphorylated RNA ends [18, 19, 20]. RIG-I forms oligomers along the bound RNA in an ATP-dependent manner, the CARDs oligomerize and allow signalling through CARD\u2013CARD interactions with MAVS [21, 22]. Activation in addition requires dephosphorylation and ubiquitination of RIG-I [23]. Optimal RIG-I ligands are consisting of blunt dsRNA formed by two complementary RNAs (e.g. Reovirus) or generated by intramolecular base pairing as is proposed for the sensing of influenza A virus ribonucleoprotein complexes [20].",

            "text": "Other proteins belonging to RLR helicases are MDA5 and LGP2. LGP2 lacks functional CARD domains and therefore cannot induce signalling. However, LGP2 appears to be an important co-factor to facilitate sensing of some viruses [24]. Recently, L-antisense RNA expressed by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) has been identified to associate with LGP2 [25]. L-antisense RNA activates MDA5, raising the possibility that LGP2 prepares ligands for sensing through other RLRs. MDA5 appears to be activated by structural properties of viral RNAs, but there is no unifying feature known that could generally explain MDA5 activation. Instead, a number of different RNAs are proposed to activate MDA5. Firstly, long synthetic dephosphorylated dsRNA stimulates MDA5 whereas shorter dsRNA loses this ability [26, 27]. Secondly, replication intermediates consisting of dsRNA and generated by picornaviruses [28, 29]. Thirdly, high molecular weight RNA generated during replication and likely bearing branched RNA molecules activates MDA5 [8]. The most commonly used synthetic MDA5 stimulus, poly-I:C would most likely form such structures. Fourthly, a specific sequence in the L-region present on the antisense single-stranded genomic RNA of EMCV appears to stimulate MDA5 [25]. Fifthly, for measles virus a sequence bias towards AU-rich regions was proposed to be associated with MDA5 activating activity [30]. Sixthly, mutant coronaviruses that generate RNA lacking 2\u2032O methylation on the first ribose are a stronger MDA5 agonists than corresponding wild-type viruses highlighting the possibility that MDA5 may sense a chemical modification on the RNA 5\u2032 end [31]. Similarly to RIG-I, N-terminal CARDs of MDA5 are required for downstream signalling but unlike RIG-I, MDA5 oligomerizes along dsRNA in a head to tail manner and positions the CARDs in an elongated structure that activates signalling through MAVS [32].",

            "text": "In addition to cytoplasmic RNA sensors, cells are equipped with sensors of cytoplasmic DNA. DNA sensing shows considerable cell-type specificity but in general two different concepts of DNA sensing seem to emerge: firstly, direct activation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and secondly, generation of second messengers that are activating other proteins to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Proteins directly activating IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 via the STING pathway are DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI) [33\u2022] and the more recently identified interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) [34]. IFI16 belongs to the family of PYHIN proteins and contains a pyrin domain and two DNA-binding HIN domains. IFI16 is able to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 after infection with Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) as well as transfected DNA [34, 35]. Proteins generating a second messenger include RNA polymerase-III (RNAPIII) and cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS). RNAPIII binds AT-rich regions in viral DNA genomes to produce PPP-RNA, serving as ligand for RIG-I [36, 37]. cGAS belongs to the nucleotidyltransferase family and upon dsDNA-binding generates cyclic 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 GMP\u2013AMP (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP [38, 39\u2022\u2022, 40, 41, 42]. cGAMP binds and directly activates STING and can also cross cell barriers to activate innate immune responses in adjacent cells [43]. Although the exact viral ligand has not yet been defined, lack of cGAS in human or mouse cells impairs interferon responses to DNA viruses and transfected DNA [44\u2022\u2022].",

These proteins include 2\u20325\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). DsRNA binding to OAS catalyses the conversion of ATP to 2\u20325\u2032-linked oligoadenylates, which activate the latent ribonuclease RNASEL to degrade cellular and viral RNAs [42]. RNASEL cleavage products have been demonstrated to stimulate the MAVS pathway but the exact mechanism is not known. PKR is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated either by dsRNA of at least 30 bp in length or by PPP-RNA and suppresses general translation by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2-\u03b1) [45, 46]. In addition PKR induces apoptosis and regulates cytokine expression, most likely by modulating mRNA stability. Some nucleic acid binding proteins, such as the PYHIN family member AIM2, regulate post-translational processing and cell death [47]. AIM2 binds DNA and triggers the activation of the inflammasome, a molecular platform responsible for the maturation of interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL18 as well as triggering cell death. The RNA-binding helicases RIG-I [48] and DHX33 [49] have also been implicated in inflammasome activation, but the precise molecular details remain to be determined.",

IFITs bind viral RNA through a deep binding cleft formed by a complex arrangement of tetratricopeptide repeats [50, 51]. IFIT1 preferentially binds single-stranded capped non-2\u2032O-methylated (Cap0) or 5\u2032 triphosphorylated (PPP) RNA, IFIT5 exclusively binds PPP-RNA [12, 52\u2022].

Viral nucleic acids are directly targeted for degradation by 2\u20325\u2032oligoadenylate-activated ribonuclease RNASEL [45] and by Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), which specifically targets viral mRNAs for degradation through recruitment of the cellular exosome machinery [55\u2022]. DNA degradation through Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is required to restrict endogenous retroviruses [56].",

Despite remarkable progress in the last few years to uncover modifications that are sensed by the innate immune system, many questions still remain to be answered. The natural ligand of cytoplasmic sensors, for instance, is often not well understood, nor do we know the exact localisation of virus sensing in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, numerous cellular pathways and second messengers contribute to innate immunity to viral pathogens and cell biological processes are similarly prominent in contributing to virus defence. We thus anticipate that even more entangled relationships between viruses and hosts are likely to be uncovered in the future.",

Engagement of a particular set of nucleic acid sensors (Class I sensors, red) results in signal transduction events, leading to expression of the type I interferons IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and other cytokines. These in turn upregulate additional sensors (Class II sensors, green) with the ability to modulate the cellular machinery. In addition cytokines induce expression of effector proteins (blue) directly targeting viral nucleic acids. Transmission of signals in some pathways occurs through second messengers (yellow). Class II sensors include PKR, OAS and AIM2. PKR phosphorylates translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 and consequently inhibits translation. Activated OAS synthesises the second messenger 2\u20325\u2032 oligoA, which then binds to and activates the latent endoribonuclease RNASEL. Activation of the inflammasome, a large multimeric complex including pro-caspase-1, is mediated by the DNA sensor AIM2. Caspase-1 cleaves its substrates pro-IL-1b and IL-18 for extracellular release. For signal transduction, MDA5 and RIG-I (either activated directly or through binding of RNAPIII-synthesised PPP-RNA) engage the adaptor protein MAVS. cGAS and IFI16 transmit their signal to the adaptor STING. Both pathways culminate in phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF-3 as well as release of active NF\u03baB into the nucleus, where they cooperate to form an enhanceosome to turn on transcription of cytokine genes.
