The etiologic agent associated with the clinical disease pattern was quickly identified to be a novel coronavirus (CoV) denominated SARS-CoV.1, 2 CoVs are enveloped viruses harbouring a positive-strand RNA genome.3 Like all other CoVs, SARS-CoV encodes four structural proteins\u2014the membrane, envelope, spike, and nucleocapsid protein (N) proteins. In addition, nine predicted unique open reading frames (ORFs) of proteins with primarily mostly unknown function are encoded within the 3\u2032 end of the genome.4, 5 However, it is already known that ORF7a and ORF3a are involved in the induction of apoptosis.6, 7, 8, 9 ORF6 and ORF3b, as well as N, inhibit interferon-\u03b2 synthesis.10 Furthermore, ORF3a forms an ion channel, thereby enhancing virus release.11 Before the identification of SARS-CoV, CoVs were classified into three groups (I\u2013III). Upon phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV was shown to belong to the novel group IV,4, 5 with a distant relationship to group II CoVs, including members such as the human CoV OC-43 and the murine hepatitis virus (MHV).12, 13, 14\n",

Nevertheless, the localization of N within the nucleus upon transfection or infection of cells with SARS-CoV is still controversially discussed,25, 26, 27, 28, 29 whereas targeting of N proteins from different CoVs to the nucleus and to nucleoli had been described.30, 31 Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was identified as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV.32 Like for other human CoVs, the infection of different cell types with SARS-CoV can either be lytic or lead to viral persistence.33, 34, 35, 36 Specifically, the African green monkey cell line Vero E6 undergoes rapid lysis upon infection, but viral persistence can be established.33, 34 In contrast, colonic cancer cells and neuronal cells are persistently infected by SARS-CoV.35, 36\n",

We found that the titer of SARS-CoV propagated on Caco-2 cells was significantly lower (6.5 \u00d7 104 pfu/ml) than the titer of infected Vero E6 cells (1.8 \u00d7 106 pfu/ml). Consequently, we used Caco-2 and Vero E6 cells as a model for persistent and that for more lytic SARS-CoV infection, respectively. We inoculated both cell lines with SARS-CoV, lysed them on days 1, 2, and 3 p.i., and subjected the lysates to immunoblot analysis. Interestingly, depending on the cell line, we found only one N-specific band corresponding to the expected full-length size of 46 kDa or, in addition, a slightly faster-migrating band (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1\n). In SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, we found full-length N and an additional N-specific signal at each time point of lysis (Fig. 1a). In SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, however, at any time point of lysis, only the full-length signal of N was detectable (Fig. 1b).",

In order to test whether this form was generated by proteolytical cleavage, we initially used various protease and caspase inhibitors (CIs) to decipher the responsible proteases. SARS-CoV N-transfected Vero E6 cells were mock treated or treated with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), lactacystin (LC), or a cell-permeable pan-CI, and lysates were analysed in immunoblot. Whereas treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl and the proteasome inhibitor LC showed no effect, full-length N was detectable upon pan-CI treatment (Fig. 2a), which prevents activation of caspase-1- and caspase-3-related caspases. This indicates that the lower band is the result of caspase-mediated cleavage. Inhibition of caspase-3-related caspases prevents the activity of effector caspases-3, -6, and -7, which are the executors of apoptosis at the end of the caspase cascade. To define now which effector caspase caused the N processing, we used similar conditions as described in Fig. 2a, now using cell-permeable caspase-3- and caspase-6-specific inhibitors. As found before, mock-, NH4Cl-, or LC-treated cells still revealed cleavage of N. However, cells treated with caspase-3 inhibitor (CI-3, Fig. 2b) or CI-6 (Fig. 2c) showed only the full-length signal of N, indicating that N processing is mediated directly by caspase-6 and caspase-3 or indirectly by activation of caspase-6 by caspase-3.",

Three days post-transfection, we analysed the lysates by immunoblotting. We found only one signal for Bad in the positive control and in N-transfected cells, indicating complete de-phosphorylation. In the negative control (Fig. 3d), however, we detected two signals. These data show that N, as well as the commonly used apoptosis inducer staurosporine, can cause de-phosphorylation of Bad.",

To determine the main NLS of N, we first deleted the C-terminal NLS (360\u2013422), including the five motifs. This deletion had no effect on the nuclear localization of SARS-CoV N (data not shown), however. Therefore, we investigated the NLS in the middle of N and substituted three lysines at positions 257, 258, and 262 with glycins (NLSII; Fig. 6b). Lysines mediate the transport into the nucleus by binding to importins. To test whether this NLS is mainly responsible for the nuclear localization of N, we transiently transfected Vero E6 cells with the NLS substitution mutant (NLSII) and with wt N as a control (Fig. 6c). On days 2 and 3 post-transfection, a nuclear fractionation assay was performed. In contrast to wt N, the substitution mutant (NLSII) did not localize to the nucleus. Moreover, only the uncleaved full-length signal for NLSII was detectable, strongly indicating a correlation between nuclear localization and processing of N. Although it was already demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis in a previous study that the NLSII sequence of SARS-CoV is a general NLS,26 we investigated whether we can confirm this by nuclear fractionation assay. Therefore, we fused the NLSII sequence to the N-terminus of the cytosolic protein Grb2 (NLSII-Grb2) and expressed it as well as Grb2 in Vero E6 cells. Two days after transfection, we separated the nuclear and cytosolic fractions and analysed them with anti-Grb2 antibodies in immunoblot. In contrast to the nuclear fraction of Grb2, we detected a signal in the nuclear fraction of NLSII-Grb2 (Fig. 6d), indicating that NLSII is a functional NLS. To confirm the observation that the activation of apoptotic pathways correlates with nuclear localization of N, we investigated the activation of Bad under the same conditions as previously described (Fig. 3d). Therefore, we transiently transfected cells with N and NLSII. Three days post-transfection, cells were lysed and analysed with an anti-Bad antibody by immunoblotting (Fig. 6e). We detected phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated Bad in NLSII-transfected cells, in contrast to N-transfected cells containing only the de-phosphorylated form of Bad. To exclude that this effect is due to different expression levels of N and NLSII, we subjected an aliquot of the lysates to immunoblot analysis using anti-N antisera. This immunoblot analysis revealed that the expression of N and that of NLSII were nearly the same (Fig. 6f).",

N processing is only observed in cells known to be lytically infected by SARS-CoV, such as Vero E6 and A549 cells, but not in Caco-2 and N2a cells, which we used as models for persistently infected cells.35, 36 Of note, characterization of SARS-CoV pathogenesis by autopsied tissues from SARS patients revealed viral signals in the lung with severe harm, whereas in the intestine and brain, no apparent damage was observed despite detectable amounts of SARS-CoV.44, 45, 46 First, these give evidence that intestine and neural tissues might be persistently infected by SARS-CoV. Second, these raise the question of whether N is involved in the establishment of lytic or persistent infection. In infected Vero E6 cells, the transcription factor STAT3 is de-phosphorylated and disappears from the nucleus,47 resulting in decreased cell viability. In N-transfected COS-1 cells, p38 MAPK and JNK as well as caspase-3 and caspase-7 are up-regulated.20 In contrast, in persistently infected Vero E6 subclones, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are up-regulated. Here, transient expression of N induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK, possibly leading to the establishment of persistence.33 In human intestinal epithelial cells and in neurons, the PI3/Akt pathway can be involved in cell survival.48, 49, 50 Therefore, the different regulation of survival pathways in various cell lines could account for the distinctions exhibited by N regarding activation of apoptotic pathways.",

            "text": "Many viruses evoke apoptosis in infected cells. This is also the case in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells,18 raising the common question of whether here induction of apoptosis is host defence or is even favourable for the viral life cycle. In the case of host defence, the infected cell initiates apoptosis to inhibit spread of progeny virus or to eliminate viral proteins at the end of the apoptotic cascade. However, a growing number of viruses were shown to adapt to the host cell death machinery in order to promote spread of progeny or to utilize caspases to cleave their own proteins for benefiting viral replication or persistence.51 CoV-induced apoptosis occurs upon infection of cells with TGEV, and here the N protein serves as substrate for caspase-6 and caspase-7.37 In defined SARS-CoV-infected cell lines, N is also cleaved by caspases. Moreover, we show here that upon transient expression, N itself is an inducer and subsequently a substrate of caspase-6 in Vero E6 and A549 cells. This is in contrast to many other viral proteins, which either provoke or are the target of apoptosis, and suggests that caspase-6 activity and subsequent processing of N have roles during viral maturation other than simply the induction of apoptosis to fend the virus. In general, the N protein would be an appropriate target for fending of viral invasion, since this protein is necessary for viral assembly. Moreover, in the case of TGEV, only full-length N is packaged in the virion,37 indicating that caspase-6 processing might inhibit viral assembly. On the other hand, in Vero E6 cells, high viral titers are achieved despite N cleavage. Furthermore, a caspase cleavage site occurs also in TGEV N and has not been eliminated by mutations more beneficial for the virus, suggesting an important role for the viral life cycle.",

            "text": "We found that in lytically infected Vero E6 and A549 cells, but not in cell models for persistent infection, N was located in the nucleus. This means that only in cells exhibiting nuclear localization of N was the protein processed by caspase-6. This raises two possibilities: either N is translocated to the nucleus, leading to the induction of caspase-6 activity, or N can only be imported into the nucleus if caspase-6 is active during apoptotic processes. An example for such a mechanism is provided by the NS1 protein of Aleutian mink disease parvovirus.52 When we analysed a mutant of N containing substitutions within the predicted NLS between residue 257 and residue 265, it was not imported into the nucleus. This demonstrates that this stretch contains a functional NLS, supported by the partial redistribution to the nucleus of transiently expressed cytosolic Grb2 fused to this NLS. Even more interesting are that the mutant was not cleaved in Vero E6 cells and Bad was not de-phosphorylated, indicating that apoptosis and, subsequently, caspase-6 were not activated. Furthermore, treatment of N-transfected Vero E6 cells with CIs did not prevent nuclear localization of N (data not shown), indicating that caspase cleavage is not necessary for nuclear import of N. This leads to the conclusion that nuclear localization of N is a prerequisite for the induction of caspase-6 activity. Of note, we found both processed and full-length N within the nucleus. This is reasonable, as the processed form of N still contains the NLS. Since caspase-6 cleaves lamin A during apoptosis, leading to an increased permeability of the nuclear pores,51 N might also enter the nuclei of apoptotic cells non-specifically by passive diffusion. This was basically excluded by us because the cytosolic marker protein Grb2 was detectable exclusively within cytoplasmic fractions.",

Persistence of these NLS-null mutants was observed, but detailed analysis revealed that nuclear localization of N protein of these viruses was restored by point mutations within the NLS, resulting in a functional NLS.54 In addition, some MHV strains cause fulminant hepatitis in mice, dependent on N and the infected cell type.

N translocates into the nucleus (1) and may activate gene expression or interact with nuclear components there (2), resulting in the de-phosphorylation of Bad (3). In this form, Bad is enabled to interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (4). This interaction releases Bax and Bak from pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins, enabling insertion of Bax and Bak in the mitochondrial membrane. The resulting membrane permeabilization facilitates cytochrome c efflux (5), which provokes the activation of pro-caspase-9 by formation of apoptosome. Once caspase-9 is activated, the caspase cascade occurs and effector caspases (i.e., caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7) are activated (6). Finally, N is cleaved by caspase-6 (7), but cleavage of N may additionally be caused by caspase-3 or caspase-7.",
