For the latent infection mainly established in ganglion cells and tonsils, it becomes a reservoir of BoHV-1 allowing the virus spreading to susceptible animals (Winkler et al., 2000). Now it is worldwide distributed and tends to be endemic in most populations, though national and regional variations occur (Kampa et al., 2009).",

It is thought that lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, phospholipids with long, unsaturated acyl chains, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins and at least some membrane-spanning proteins (Simons and van Meer, 1988, Simons and Ikonen, 1997, Simons and Toomre, 2000). Approximately 15\u201320% of the plasma membrane surface area is believed to consist of lipid rafts (Parolini et al., 1999, Schutz et al., 2000). The tight packaging domains are associated with numerous important biological processes, such as transmembrane signal transduction, apoptosis, cell adhesion, migration, synaptic transmission, organization of the cytoskeleton, and protein sorting during endocytosis and exocytosis (Brown and London, 1998, Simons and Toomre, 2000, Harris and Siu, 2002, Tsui-Pierchala et al., 2002). However, the extraction of cholesterol by various chemicals destroys the raft organization and consequently blocks biological processes that depend on lipid rafts. So the function of lipid rafts in some biological process can be evaluated by studying the role of cholesterol.",

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection requires cholesterol, both in the target cell membrane and the viral envelope (Guyader et al., 2002, Liao et al., 2001, Liao et al., 2003). Many viruses require cholesterol in the target cell membrane, such as Semliki Forest virus (Phalen and Kielian, 1991, Ahn et al., 2002), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (Li et al., 2007) and SV40 virus (Anderson et al., 1996). For influenza virus and duck hepatitis B virus, the presence of cholesterol in its viral envelope is critical, but it is not essential in the target cell (Sun and Whittaker, 2003, Funk et al., 2008). Whereas numerous strains of flavivirus dengue virus and yellow fever virus 17D enter and infect cells independent of cholesterol (Umashankar et al., 2008).",

BoHV-1 is an enveloped virus which is rich in lipid rafts. So the role of cholesterol for the virus infection in both viral envelope and target cell membrane should be investigated, respectively. Firstly our observation showed that productive virus entry was significantly reduced when the MDBK cells membrane cholesterol was reduced by the treatment of M\u03b2CD. During the investigation the drug-treated cells were washed extensively before the addition of virus, allowing cholesterol from the target cells to be reduced exclusively, whilst the virus particle cholesterol remained intact. Similarly, when investigated the role of viral envelope cholesterol for the virus infectivity, the drug treated virions were separated from the reagent by ultracentrifugation. So that the disruption of cell membrane lipid rafts by M\u03b2CD was excluded. Depletion of cholesterol from viral membrane and cell membrane by M\u03b2CD pretreatment significantly inhibited the virus production, and the inhibitory effect could be partially reversed by exogenous cholesterol replenishment indicating that the decreased infectivity was at least in part due to the depletion of cholesterol from the membranes.",

In this study, the role of cholesterol played in the three important stages including, binding, entry and post-entry was separately investigated. As a result, the two independent methods, virus titration and FACS indicated that M\u03b2CD treatment did not inhibit the virus binding to the MDBK cells. To investigate whether lipid rafts play a role in the post-entry step(s), we treated the cells with M\u03b2CD after the virus entry. The results on virus production revealed that Treat: +1 also inhibited virus replication, but compared to Treat: \u22120.5 the effect of the later was much more significant. These results suggested that cholesterol was mainly required at the early replication process, especially for the entry events, as reported for other viruses (Hambleton et al., 2007, Li et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The sensitivity of the virus to M\u03b2CD treatment may be explained by the association of virus receptors or co-receptors with lipid rafts similar to the findings obtained about HIV-1 virus (Popik et al., 2002, Kozak et al., 2002). The virus receptor(s) for BoHV-1 has not yet been well defined. Two proteins as the candidate receptors with molecular weight of 56 and 60 kDa had been reported (Thaker et al., 1994, Varthakavi and Minocha, 1996). But the amino acid sequence for the two proteins is unknown. Connolly et al. (2001) reported that BoHV-1 gD could bind to human nectin-1 with low affinity. However, the affinity of BoHV-1 gD for bovine nectin-1 is unknown. And there is no evidence reported by the others, indicating that nectin-1 on the native bovine cells surface could bind to BoHV-1 gD. And based on their data Connolly et al. (2001) predicted that BoHV-1 infection of its natural host may be mediated by a receptor other than a bovine nectin-1 homolog. Their study also indicated that BoHV-1 likely used multiple receptors for entry into bovine cells. So if the bovine nectin-1 homolog serves as receptor for BoHV-1 remains to be determined. Under this condition, whether M\u03b2CD treatment affected the receptor(s) and coreceptor(s) expression or the interaction between BoHV-1 and receptor(s) or coreceptor(s) could not be determined until the virus receptor(s) and co-receptors were discovered in the future. In addition, we proposed that some signal molecules located in lipid raft and M\u03b2CD treatment destructed corresponding signal transduction process, which was crucial in the virus life cycle. Based on this presume further study is being carried out.",
