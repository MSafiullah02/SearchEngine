In part, this research has tried to improve our understanding of interconnections between resource management and social and cultural change on the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska. Applied social science research fills an important role in resource planning activities. Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW) scientists initiated a number of social science studies to respond to needs identified during the revision of the Tongass Land Management Plan from 1995 to 1997. These became known as the follow-on studies.",

Summaries from economic studies are provided elsewhere in this collection (Crone, this issue). A clear and common thread is the close connection between the Tongass National Forest and its management to life in southeast Alaska. I have summarized findings from studies of traditional ecological knowledge, subsistence use of natural resources, tourism trends and the effects of tourism on communities, and social acceptability of alternative timber harvest practices. Other than the alternative timber harvest practices study, social aspects of timber harvest were not addressed in the studies. The studies offered here are not meant to imply that these are the only social science topics of importance. Findings are available for managers to use in future planning and decision-making. Management implications are discussed along with suggestions for further study.",

Trees harvested from the Tongass sustained a substantial wood products industry for many years, but with shifting global markets and mill closures, fishing and seafood processing surpassed timber as the region's largest private industry in 1994 (Allen et al., 1998). Recently, the success of commercial farming of Atlantic salmon in Canada and Chile has resulted in an economic decline in the Alaska salmon industry (Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, 2003). The state's economic picture is complex, with service growth, export substitution, non-wage income, and government spending driving much of the economy.

First, subsistence harvest of wild foods continues to provide a large portion of the diet for residents of southeast Alaska communities. In most communities studied, consumption of wild game and fish meets or exceeds the national average for consumption of meat, fish, and poultry. Second, per capita harvest levels in Native communities and larger communities remained consistent from 1980 through the recent study. In some smaller communities there was a notable difference, but it could be explained by special events or changes in harvest behavior of a small number of people. Third, subsistence harvest levels differed across the region. The differences in harvest levels among communities cannot always be explained by differences in ethnicity, income, community size, or access to resources. The differences may be related to community demographic composition, cultural traditions, and community history. Additional research is needed to help identify this complex relationship. Finally, some households harvest more fish and wildlife than the household can consume. The surplus is distributed through customary distribution practices including kinship networks, barter, and trade. In Yakutat, 25% of households harvest about 75% of the total community subsistence harvest by weight. The lowest harvesting 50% of all households harvest just 8% of the total community harvest.",

First, the presence of a public infrastructure to access public lands is important to tourism. Second, the places that support tourism are also home to Alaskans; these same places are where residents live, work, play, and harvest resources for personal and commercial purposes. Third, Alaskans travel throughout the state and use the same visitor facilities as tourists. Fourth, tourism is location-specific; it can be difficult to encourage in some places and almost impossible to stop or slow in others. Finally, no single entity can manage and direct tourism growth. In southeast Alaska, the Forest Service manages 80% of the land, and Native corporations, National Park Service, private owners, and the state (Department of Natural Resources manages tidelands) manage the remainder. Local governments control docks, shore facilities, entry portals, and main retail sites; however, they manage only small amounts of land under their jurisdictions. This multitude of authorities and lack of coordination results in piecemeal planning and management that may be counterproductive or contradictory.",

Maintaining quality bear habitat and creating conditions that enable reliable bear viewing without negatively impacting the bears or creating the potential for bear\u2013human conflicts continues to challenge resource managers. Demand for bear-viewing opportunities is high and the supply is extremely limited. Demand for whale watching also challenges resource managers to find methods or venues that allow viewing without disturbing whales, sea lions, and other marine mammals.

Often visitors have a romanticized perception of life in Alaska and the aggressive interest some take in everyday activities can be offensive to local residents. Some residents also felt they were unfairly judged about their community and lifestyle.\u2022\nImpacts on wildlife and subsistence resources\u2014Many residents expressed fear that tourism is negatively impacting wildlife and the environment, particularly the quality and quantity of subsistence resources. Residents who depend on subsistence resources are concerned about effects of cruise ship discharges on fish, shellfish, seaweed, and other resources. In Craig, the expansion of the tourism industry into freshwater fishing and flyfishing might impact subsistence uses of lakes and streams. In Haines, tour groups use the best subsistence fishing spots, displacing subsistence users. Hoonah families voiced concern that their clan's special places for gathering berries, seaweed, cockles, or fish might become tourist stops, impacting both the resource and their experience.\u2022\nCommunity change and a desire to maintain a rural lifestyle\u2014Alaska is no stranger to a boom-bust economy. Mining, fishing, and timber are part of southeast Alaska's identity. Tourism is equally tied to the region's natural resources. Much like each of the other industries, tourism has brought newcomers to the area. Although the newcomers may have different values, habits, and priorities than long-time residents, most seem to share a love for Alaska and find ways to become part of the local community.\u2022\nPace of life\u2014Tourism accelerates the pace of life. Activities pick up in the spring as lodges and tourism-related businesses get ready for the summer season. The extended daylight coupled with the influx of seasonal employees and tourists often result in a frenetic pace, especially for those involved in tourism. Some residents welcome the change of pace and infusion of energy whereas others resent sharing the tranquility and beauty of favorite places with outsiders.\u2022\nCommercialization\u2014Many residents fear that their community will succumb to commercialization. Residents fear that the community will lose its identity and essential character and become simply a tourist attraction.\u2022\nLocal control\u2014Increasing tourism has resulted from and resulted in an influx of nonlocal business owners. Residents of Haines want to minimize the undesirable aspects of tourism and promote community well-being. Hoonah leaders also want to plan tourism growth, so the identity and character of the community will be preserved and the daily lives of residents will not be disrupted. Lodge-based tourism has not had a big impact on the community of Craig, but as tourism becomes more diversified residents might become more proactive to protect the character of the community.\u2022\nControl of natural resources\u2014Echoing the concerns expressed earlier about impacts on wildlife and subsistence resources, residents felt strongly about the need to control local resources. In Haines, the resources of concern included local recreation areas, remote wild areas, and neighborhood resources such as beaches, water springs, and hiking trails. In Hoonah, residents primarily were concerned about deer, and in Craig concerns centered around fish.\n",

How are rural communities in Canada (and other countries) that are also faced with economic downturns in timber and fishing adapting? What transition strategies work for rural communities? Native and non-Native rural communities in Alaska are in transition. What factors contribute to their capacity to adapt to change? How are land managers in other countries gathering and using traditional ecological knowledge? What lessons can we learn from communities that have pursued ecotourism and cultural tourism? What lessons can we share with other parts of the world? Does the use of participatory processes improve social acceptability of management decisions? What processes work and why?",
