Influenza B and C viruses are resistant.1 In the past, epidemic human and avian strains of influenza viruses have generally been susceptible to amantadine.2 However, since 2008-2009, isolates of influenza A/H1N1 and H3N2, highly pathogenic avian H5N1, and A (H1N1)pdm09 are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine (see later discussion).3 By plaque assay, inhibitory con\u00adcentrations of the drugs range from 0.1 to 0.4 \u00b5g/mL or less for sensitive human influenza A viruses. Rimantadine is 4 to 10 times more active than amantadine in some assay systems. Both drugs are inhibitory for virus containing the M protein from the 1918 pandemic strain.4\n",

Low concentrations inhibit the ion channel function of the M2 protein of influenza A viruses, which affects two different stages in virus replication.13, 14, 15 The primary effect involves inhibition of viral uncoating or disassembly of the virion during endocytosis. For subtype H5 and H7 viruses, a late effect on hemagglutinin maturation and viral assembly is presumably mediated through altered pH regulation of the trans-Golgi network. Amantadine and rimantadine block proton permeation and prevent M2-mediated changes in pH. This action probably accounts for inhibition of the acid-mediated dissociation of the matrix protein from the ribonucleoprotein complex within endosomes early in replication and potentiation of acidic pH\u2013induced alterations in the hemagglutinin during its transport late in infection.",

The emergence of widespread and nearly complete amantadine resistance among influenza A/H3N2 isolates,26 as well as the amantadine resistance of the pandemic A (H1N1)pdm09 strains, precludes the empirical use of adamantanes for management of an untyped influenza A outbreak. Amantadine and rimantadine, both at a dosage of 200 mg/day in adults, are about 70% to 90% protective against clinical illness caused by various susceptible influenza A subtypes, including susceptible pandemic strains.51 Prophylaxis is effective in preventing nosocomial influenza and possibly in curtailing nosocomial outbreaks caused by such strains. Protection seems to be additive to that provided by vaccine.52\n",

Rimantadine administration to school-aged children (5 mg/kg/day) decreased the risk for influenza A illness in recipients and possibly in their family contacts.

Early treatment in ambulatory adults (200 mg/day for 5 days) reduces the duration of fever and systemic complaints by 1 to 2 days, decreases virus shedding, and shortens time to resumption of usual activities.22 In illness caused by H3N2-subtype influenza viruses, certain abnormalities of peripheral airways function, but not of airway hyperreactivity, resolve more quickly in amantadine-treated patients. Amantadine or rimantadine treatment in adults with leukemia or stem cell transplantation may reduce the risk for pneumonia,55 but more recent data suggest that in stem cell transplant recipients, early neuraminidase inhibitor therapy may be preferred to adamantanes, because it may prevent progression to pneumonia and decrease viral shedding, thereby possibly preventing both influenza-related death in index patients and nosocomial transmission to others.56 In children, rimantadine treatment is associated with lower symptom burden, fever, and viral titers during the first 2 days of treatment compared with acetaminophen administration, but rimantadine-treated children have more prolonged shedding of virus. Treatment generally does not seem to affect humoral immune responses to infection, but may blunt secretory antibody levels.57\n",

Geometric mean laninamivir octanoate clearance values declined from 26.0 mL/min in normal control subjects to 6.5 mL/min in patients with severe renal impairment.

Among individuals infected with influenza A H3N2 virus, median times to illness alleviation were not different between those treated with laninamivir octanoate 40 mg (73.5 hours) and oseltamivir (67.5 hours) but significantly longer in the group treated with laninamivir octanoate 20 mg (91.2 hours). There were no differences among the groups in H3N2 virus concentration in upper airway secretions or persistence. The 95% confidence intervals of the pooled analysis of all data were less than the prescribed noninferiority margin. It was concluded that a single inhalation of laninamivir octanoate is effective for treatment of seasonal influenza including that caused by oseltamivir-resistant virus in adults.",

The estimated bioavailability of the carboxylate is approximately 80%,127 and its time to maximal plasma concentrations averages 2 to 4 hours. Dose proportionality of oseltamivir has been reported over the dose range from 75 to 675 mg. Only low blood levels of the prodrug are detectable. Rarely, possession of a constitutive variant of carboxylesterase 1, the enzyme that normally catalyzes the conversion of oseltamivir phosphate to carboxylate, can markedly impair the hydrolysis of the parent compound, resulting in the potential for a compromised antiviral effect after oseltamivir administration.128, 129 Ingestion with food delays absorption slightly but does not decrease overall bioavailability. Oseltamivir administered via a nasogastric tube to patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was well absorbed and converted to oseltamivir carboxylate.130, 131 In healthy adults, peak and trough plasma concentrations average 0.35 \u00b5g/mL and 0.14 \u00b5g/mL after 75-mg doses.132 In infants up to 1 year of age, systemic exposure (AUC0-12 hr) to the carboxylate exhibits decreasing variability while clearance increases.121 Recommended doses of oseltamivir are 3.0 mg/kg twice daily for infants from birth to 8 months of age and 3.5 mg/kg twice daily for those 9 to 11 months of age. In children older than 1 year, carboxylate exposure increases gradually with increasing age132 so that weight-based dosing is recommended.133 In healthy elderly adults, overall drug exposure is about 25% greater than in younger adults, most likely owing to differences in renal elimination. Morbid obesity (body mass index \u226540 kg/m2) does not alter oseltamivir pharmacokinetics.134 The effects of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir are unclear. One study reported no differences among women in the third trimester of pregnancy and historical controls,135 whereas another reported a 25% to 30% reduction in systemic (AUC0-12 hr) oseltamivir-carboxylate exposure in pregnant women compared with concurrent nonpregnant controls, perhaps suggesting a need for 75 mg three times a day of oseltamivir for treatment.136\n",

These gastrointestinal complaints are usually mild to moderate in intensity, resolve despite continued dosing, and are ameliorated by administration with food. Nausea and vomiting (and possibly, dizziness) are dose related in adults.155 Discontinuation rates of 1% to 2% were observed in controlled treatment studies. The mechanism of nausea and vomiting is uncertain, but the risk seems to be lower in older adults. Long-term prophylaxis has not been associated with an increased risk for adverse events,97, 156 although headache may occur in older recipients. Self-injury, delirium, and psychiatric illness have been reported in patients, primarily pediatric or adolescent, with influenza treated with oseltamivir, mostly in Japan.157 Analyses of neuropsychiatric reactions among patients with influenza treated with oseltamivir in three large U.S. administrative databases did not demonstrate such an association.158, 159, 160 The decline in cases in Japan after a regulatory recommendation to restrict oseltamivir use in children 10 to 19 years of age has been associated with a decline in oseltamivir-related cases but a corresponding rise in cases associated with zanamivir, the inhaled, minimally systemically bioavailable neuraminidase inhibitor. The latter fact raises further doubts about a causal association between oseltamivir therapy and neuropsychiatric and behavioral adverse reactions in patients with influenza.161 Erythematous rashes and rare instances of severe eruptions or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatic inflammation, hemorrhagic colitis, anaphylaxis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported, but their relationship to oseltamivir is uncertain.",

Combination treatment of influenza A virus infection in cell culture and in mice with peramivir and ribavirin yields additive or synergistic interactions with no increase in toxicity.191 The antiviral effect of combinations of peramivir plus rimantadine in vitro is variable, ranging from additive to synergistic.192 In mice with experimental influenza infections, the combination of peramivir and rimantadine is synergistic.193 In murine and ferret models of influenza infection, peramivir is effective when administered intranasally,194 orally,195 and intramuscularly.196\n",

The median inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (IC50) for the neuraminidase of the patient viruses ranged from 1.15 nmol/L for influenza A/H1N1, 1.36 nmol/L for influenza A/H3N2, and 2.81 nmol/L for influenza B isolates.204 In pediatric patients 1 month to 15 years of age infected with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, an intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg once daily produced comparable plasma concentrations to those seen in young healthy adults (see earlier): median peramivir plasma concentrations were 33,150 ng/mL at the end of the infusion and 20.7 ng/mL 18 to 24 hours later.207 The relationship of these plasma concentration data to efficacy is unclear.

Zanamivir inhibits certain influenza A neuraminidase variants that are resistant to oseltamivir carboxylate.96 Combinations of zanamivir plus rimantadine inhibit strains of influenza A/H1N1 and H3N2 viruses synergistically, but some concentrations seem antagonistic when assessed by reductions in cell-associated virus yield.281 Zanamivir is not cytotoxic and is highly selective for influenza neuraminidase, inhibiting neuraminidases from human282 and other mammalian sources or other pathogens only at 106-fold higher concentrations. Millimolar concentrations inhibit parainfluenza virus type 3 in cell culture, most likely by blocking attachment.283 Topical zanamivir in the respiratory tract is active in murine and ferret models of influenza.277\n",

Consequently, use in patients with underlying airway disease is not generally recommended in the United States, although treatment in at-risk patients is used in other countries.312 If used in patients with obstructive airway disease, zanamivir should be administered cautiously under close observation and with availability of fast-acting bronchodilators.",

Prolonged retention of high-molecular-weight polymeric conjugates compared with monomeric zanamivir is expected. However, the prolonged lung retention time of some smaller conjugates indicates that aqueous insolubility and aggregate formation plus partitioning into cell membrane phospholipids may also play a role in the prolonged retention of zanamivir polymeric conjugates in the lung after inhalation.343\n",
