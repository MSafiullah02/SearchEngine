The Glycyrrhiza shrub is a member of the pea family and grows in subtropical climates in rich soil. Below ground, the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant has an extensive root system with a main taproot and numerous runners. The main taproot, which is harvested for medicinal use, is soft, fibrous, and has a bright yellow interior [7].",

This complex is composed of triterpene, saponin, flavonoids, polysaccharides, pectins, simple sugars, amino acids, mineral salts, asparagines, bitters, essential oil, fat, female hormone estrogen, gums, mucilage (rhizome), protein, resins, starches, sterols, volatile oils, tannins, glycosides, and various other substances [8, 9]. Glycyrrhizin (Fig. 2), a triterpenoid compound, accounts for the sweet taste of licorice root. This compound represents a mixture of potassium-calcium-magnesium salts of glycyrrhizic acid that varies within a 2\u201325% range. Among the natural saponin, glycyrrhizic acid is a molecule composed of a hydrophilic part, two molecules of glucuronic acid, and a hydrophobic fragment, glycyrrhetic acid (Fig. 3) [10]. The yellow color of licorice is due to the flavonoid content of the plant, which includes liquiritin (Fig. 4), isoliquiritin (Fig. 5) (a chalcone) and other compounds [11]. The isoflavones, glabridin (Fig. 6) and hispaglabridins A and B have significant antioxidant activity [12], and both glabridin and glabrene possess estrogen-like activity [13].\n\n\n\n\n",

Glycyrrhetic acid could trigger the proapoptotic pathway by inducing mitochondrial permeability transition, and this property may be useful for inducing apoptosis of tumor cells [31, 32]. The licorice extract induced the Bcl2 phosphorylation and G2/M cycle arrest in tumor cell lines, and 70% methanol soluble fraction of licorice acetone extract was found to induce apoptosis in human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells. The compound was identified to be licocoumarone also responsible for antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [33]. The hydromethanolic root extract of G. glabra also exhibited antimutagenic potential by suppressing micronucleus formation and chromosomal aberration in bone marrow cells of albino mice [34, 35]. It was found that glycyrrhizin induced AP-1 (activator protein-1) activity in untreated cells whereas inhibited TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbal-13-acetate) induced AP-1 activity in TPA treated cells. This mechanism could serve as a model for development of new chemoprotective agents [36].

In Japan, glycyrrhizin has been used for more than 60 years as treatment for chronic hepatitis under the name of SNMC (stronger neo-minophagen-C) clinically as an antiallergic and antihepatitis agent [38]. Glycyrrhizin induced significant reduction in serum aminotransferases and improved the liver histology when compared with the placebo. It has also been implicated that long-term usage of glycyrrhizin prevents development of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis C. In vitro studies have indicated that glycyrrhizin modifies the intracellular transport and uppresses hepatitis B virus surface antigen [39, 40]. It has been found that 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), an aglycone of glycyrrhizin decreases the expression of P450 E1 thereby protecting the liver [41]. GA also prevents the oxidative and hepatic damage caused by aflatoxins by increasing the CYP1A1 and GST (glutathione-S-transferase) activities and may also contribute to anticarcinogenic activity by metabolic deactivation of the hepatotoxin [42]. One of the researches indicated that the hydromethanolic root extract of G. glabra exhibited significant protection from hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) in liver tissue of experimental mice [43]. It has also been experimentally investigated that glycyrrhizin and its analogues have a mitogenic effect via epidermal growth factor receptors subsequently stimulating the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase pathway to induce hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation [44].",

PPAR\u2019s ( peroxisome proliferation activated receptors) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors regulating the expression of a group of genes that play an important role in glucose and lipid metabolism. The PPAR receptors are classified as PPAR-\u03b1, PPAR-\u03b3, and PPAR-\u03b4. The PPAR-\u03b1 is found in liver, muscle, and kidney. PPAR-\u03b3 is associated with adipose tissue, adrenals, and small intestine whereas PPAR-\u03b4 is expressed ubiquitously. PPAR-\u03b3 serves as a predominant target for insulin sensitizing drugs like pioglitazone and roziglitazone. Ethyl acetate extract of licorice using GAL-4-PPAR-\u03b3 chimera assay exhibited a significant PPAR-\u03b3 binding activity which was attributed to seven phenolic compounds, viz., dehydroglyasperin, glyasperin B, glyasperin D, glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol, and isolglycyrol. Pioglitazone and glycyrin were found to suppress the increased blood glucose level in mice after sucrose loading during the oral sucrose tolerance test. Pioglitazone, a potent PPAR-\u03b3 agonist ameliorated the insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Similarly, glycyrin also exhibited a potent PPAR-\u03b3 ligand binding activity and therefore reduces the blood glucose level in KK-Ay (knockout diabetic mice). This finding is of much significance as licorice has also been traditionally used as an artificial sweetening agent and could be helpful in insulin resistance syndrome prevalent in the modern society [45].",

It is suggested licorice saponins are capable of potentiating aldosterone action while binding to mineral-corticoid receptors in the kidneys. In addition to hypertension, patients may experience hypokalemia and sodium retention, resulting in edema. All symptoms usually disappear with discontinuation of therapy. Many studies report no side effects during the course of treatment [27, 28]. Generally the onset and severity of symptoms depend on the dose and duration of licorice intake, as well as individual susceptibility. The amount of licorice ingested daily by patients with mineral-corticoid excess syndromes appears to vary over a wide range, from as little as 1.5 g daily to as much as 250 g daily [5, 29].",

G. glabra is an herbal plant which has lots of medicinal properties such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitussive, antidiabetic, antiviral, anticancer, antimutagenic, antiulcer, and hepatoprotective. The phytochemicals present in G. glabra have been of immense importance in phytotherapeutics. Thus there is an immense need to modify the natural Glycyrrhiza constituents to reduce these side effects thereby generating the advanced versions of the bioactive compounds to be used as drugs in future. There are so many bioactive compounds that have been isolated from G. glabra like glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid, glabridin, liquiritin, isoliquiritigenin, isoflavones, etc. and have been assessed for medicinal potential which showed that these compounds hold a strong promise in designing future drugs. Derivatives of these compounds are being generated to evaluate their pharmacological purposes for future drug use. There are ample chances of arriving to pharmacophores with least toxic side effects using combinatorial chemistry.",

G. glabra extracts have been shown to possess lot of medicinal properties like antitussive, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, anticancer, etc. due to presence of so many bioactive components, triterpene, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid, glabridin, liquiritin, etc. G. glabra is one of those ancient plants, which have been used in the traditional pharmacopoeias for its multifaceted activities against variety of systematic and nonsystematic ailments. The chemical foundations of G. glabra have been discovered in the last era. The chemical constituents of G. glabra hold a strong promise for providing new molecules, which could be of immense medicinal applications in the drug discovery process for the development of new drugs present era.",
