It is speculated that the zoonosis of the virus happened from an intermediate host animal being sold at the market. However, no bats were being sold. It is similar to how Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) acted as the intermediate host for the zoonosis of SARS CoV in 2002\u201303 although horseshoe bats (belonging to genus Rhinolophus) were primary hosts coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses enclosed in a solar corona shaped envelope (hence the name). They belong to the sub-family Coronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae of the order Neovirales. They are further divided into four genera\u2014Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus infect only mammals, whereas the Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus mostly infect birds. The 2019-nCoV along with the SARS and MERS CoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus. Data from the phylogenetic analysis show that 2019-nCoV is distantly related to SARS CoV (with less than 79% sequence identity at genome level) or MERS CoV (less than 50% sequence identity). This proves that the 2019-nCoV is novel and distinct from the previously reported pathogenic coronaviruses. The 2019-nCoV is further classified under the sub-genera Sarbecoviruses along with two closely related (about 88% identity) bat-derived SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) designated as SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21. This throws light on the fact that 2019-nCoV like all previously reported pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS and MERS CoV) has its ancestry to coronaviruses with bats as the primary host. However, the ancestry of 2019-nCoV is not directly linked to the two bat-derived coronaviruses and homologous recombination events in an intermediate host have played a key role in the evolution of this novel strain.",

The number of males infected with 2019-nCoV is higher than the number of females. This trend was observed even at the time of the SARS-CoV outbreak. A reason behind this trend can be that X chromosome and sex hormones positively regulate innate and adaptive immunity enhancing anti-viral immunity in females (Channappanavar et al. 2017). Moreover, the 2019-nCoV like the previous SARS and MERS CoV infections elicits strong cytokine responses in the host causing increased pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Elevated levels of IgA and IgM in the lungs of an infected patient had been detected. The viral infection leads to the production of IL1B, IFN\u03b3, IP10 and MCP1 which further lead to T-Helper 1 cell production (pro-inflammatory). However, a striking observation is that unlike the previous SARS CoV the 2019-nCoV elicited the production of T-Helper 2 cell-related cytokines like IL-10 and IL-4 as well (which are associated with anti-inflammatory signature). This can be one of the reasons for relatively less severe symptoms in many patients.",

It is speculated that this patient must have been infected either through an unknown source or through droplet transmission. Moreover, spread of infection in family clusters from these patients establishes the possibility of human to human transmission of infection (Chan et al. 2020b). All the early patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus infection outside China like in Japan, Thailand or India had visited Wuhan just days before the outbreak (Zhao et al. 2020). Given the cases where health workers or other patients and visitors to hospitals across Wuhan have contracted the infection, airborne droplets due to coughing, touching and using personal hygiene items (like towels and cosmetics) of the infected and nosocomial transmission seem the most probable modes of further spread of infection. However, further investigations are required to understand the exact mode of transmission of this virus among humans.",

The spike protein is divided into two functional subunits\u2014S1 domain and S2 domain. The S1 domain is responsible for receptor binding, whereas the S2 domain is responsible for fusion of virus with the host cell membrane. The SARS-CoV forms a clover-shaped trimer with three S1 heads and a trimeric S2 stalk (Cui et al. 2019). The S1 domain is further sub-divided into an amino terminal domain (S1-NTD) and a cysteine-rich carboxy terminal domain (S1-CTD). The S1-CTD at the tip of S1 domain acts as the RDB. The RBD is further sub-divided into a core region and a receptor binding motif (RBM). The compatibility of spike protein with the host cell receptor is largely dependent on the amino acid residues in the RBM. Any changes in the RBM or even core region amino acid residues can decrease or increase the affinity of spike \u2013receptor binding. Changes in amino acid residues in RBM can even alter the virus\u2019 tropism (Song et al. 2005).",

The residues at each of these positions form a salt bridge with specific ACE-2 receptor residues. Asparagine or arginine at residue 479 of RBM increases binding affinity with human and civet (intermediate host of SARS-CoV) ACE-2, whereas lysine at the same position decreases this binding affinity. Serine at residue 487 is required for RBM binding with civet ACE-2, but it fails to bind efficiently with human ACE-2. On the other hand, mutations in SARS-CoV leading to threonine at residue 487 lead to very efficient RBM and human ACE-2 binding. The early phase SARS-CoV strain-hcGd03 (Ser at residue487) that infected humans from civets had low infectivity and failed to transmit between humans. However, middle- and late-phase SARS-CoV strains especially hTor02 had a high infectivity and rapidly transmitted between humans as it had Thr at residue 487. Therefore, it can be inferred that RBD of spike protein in Betacoronavirus is the cornerstone of infectivity and animal to human transmissions.",

Rather the S1 domain of 2019-nCoV is very similar to that of SARS-CoV with around 50 conserved amino acid residues despite the fact the two falls in different clades. Consistent with this, the homology modeling of RBD of 2019-nCoV with SARS-CoV RBD as template revealed that the RBM of the 2019-nCoV is very similar in structure to that of SARS-CoV. These results led to the conclusion that 2019-nCoV may also bind to the human ACE-2 receptor. Another study using HeLa cells expressing ACE-2 also reached the same conclusion that 2019-nCoV may bind with the ACE-2 receptors (Zhou et al. 2020). However, many residues that are crucial for binding of SARS-CoV RBD with ACE-2 vary in 2019-nCoV. The significance of these variations on ACE-2 binding needs to be further investigated.",

However, a set of RNA proofreading and editing enzymes like Exonuclease N synthesized by coronaviruses enhance the RdRp fidelity by around tenfold. It has been observed that during ecological stresses and positive selection pressures to switch between hosts the RdRp fidelity decreases presumably due to decrease in Exonuclease N activity. This in turn makes the coronavirus prone to higher rates of mutations and may lead to altered tropism. Studies have in fact shown when the selection pressures are over and the virus has successfully switched to new host, RdRp fidelity is enhanced again.",

As mentioned above, the SARS-CoV strains isolated from middle- and late-phase patients of the outbreak were more virulent and had a higher affinity for ACE-2 receptors compared to that of early phase. It is speculated that this happened due to accumulation of mutations in the S gene of middle- and late-phase strains resulting in greater affinity of spike protein for ACE-2.
