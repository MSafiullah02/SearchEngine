A number of infectious diseases, and in particular chronic infectious diseases, have also been associated with suicide. This article analyzes the association between suicide and Lyme and associated diseases (LAD). Based upon the medical literature demonstrating the physiology associated with suicide, a chart review, and epidemiological calculations, it was demonstrated there is a causal relationship between LAD and suicide, and the pathophysiology of LAD can be explained and it causes a significant number of suicides. LAD causes immune effects, biochemical changes, and a number of psychiatric symptoms that contribute to suicidal risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year. Greater understanding and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed.",

Although some symptoms may be associated with infection within the brain or in the brain vasculature, infection in the periphery can also provoke significant immune activity that crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier.13 These immune-mediated effects include activation of proinflammatory cytokines and increases in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, interferon-gamma, neopterin, C-reactive protein, surface lipoprotein E, and the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13, release of proinflammatory lipoproteins from the outer coat of B. burgdorferi, immune effects from the flagella of B. burgdorferi, immune effects from outer surface protein A of B. burgdorferi inducing apoptosis and astrogliosis, autoimmune effects, direct cytotoxicity by proximity of B. burgdorferi to neurons and adherence to and invasion of neurons, interactions with Schwann and glial cells producing nitric oxide, the spirochetes locally inducing cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 in glial cells, the secretion of cytotoxic substances by leucocytes and glial cells contributing to damage of oligodendrocytes that are vital for the functioning and survival of neurons, and other immune effects from the other known and unknown coinfections and opportunistic infections.13,17 In addition, metabolic pathophysiological changes are also associated with altered tryptophan metabolism, increases in quinolinic acid, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and changes in homocysteine metabolism.13,17,90",

Inflammation increases indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase which shifts tryptophan metabolism away from serotonin and melatonin towards an increase of quinolinic acid. Quinolinic acid correlates significantly with guilt, and the ratio of quinolinic acid/3-hydroxykynurenine correlates significantly with guilt and psychomotor agitation.91 Quinolinic acid levels also correlate with increased suicidal risk.92 High cerebrospinal fluid quinolinic acid levels correlate with high suicidal intent.93 Quinolinic acid levels have been demonstrated to be continuously elevated in the patients who had suicide attempts, and the levels were highest in close proximity to the attempt.94 Quinolinic acid is an NMDA receptor agonist which leads to an excess of calcium influx into neurons. Quinolinic acid levels are increased, while kynurenic acid, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is decreased in suicidal patients which supports a role for a glutamatergic mechanism in suicidality. Severe depression is associated with increased microglial quinolinic acid in subregions of the anterior cingulate gyrus and the anterior midcingulate cortex compared to controls.95 Quinolinic acid in cerebrospinal fluid is increased in a number of chronic infections including B. burgdorferi infections and correlates with \u201csymptom severity\u201d and \u201cpathological potential\u201d.96,97",

The orbital frontal cortex is significant in restraining impulsive outbursts, while the anterior cingulate cortex coordinates other brain regions in response to conflict. The amygdala is involved in fear response and other aversive emotions. In impulse-prone individuals, there is decreased activity in the orbital frontal cortex and/or anterior cingulate combined with normal or increased activity of the amygdala which demonstrates how these two restraining brain regions are not adequately counteracting the fear response when something is perceived and threatening and this can result in explosive and impulsive behavior.100 It has been found that decreased white matter integrity and density in the superior longitudinal fasciculus is associated with intermittent explosive disorder.101 LAD has been associated with a predominately white matter encephalopathy with white matter-processing impairments.102",

Charts in which the diagnosis of Lyme disease was unclear were excluded from the study. The 253 charts that met the criteria were divided into four groups based upon symptoms \u2013 suicidal and homicidal, suicidal not homicidal, experiencing explosive anger not suicidal or homicidal, and not suicidal, homicidal, or experiencing explosive anger. The patients who were both suicidal and homicidal were considered to be the most severe cases, while the patients who were least severe were the patients who were not homicidal, suicidal, or experiencing explosive anger. Names were converted to an identifier before entering findings into a database of individual participant data. Clinical findings most relevant to the diagnosis and suicidal risk were analyzed. All 29 of the suicidal and homicidal charts were reviewed, and a representative sample of 20 charts from the suicidal group was pulled at random from the suicidal but not homicidal group and 20 charts were pulled at random from the not suicidal, homicidal, or experiencing explosive anger group. A comparison of individual participant data is made by comparing the findings for all patients suicidal and homicidal (N=29) to the findings for those suicidal and not homicidal (N=20) and not homicidal or suicidal or experiencing explosive anger (N=20). The premorbid health status is the control for each group and is shown in parentheses in Figure 1. Symptoms associated with risk were ranked by comparing the prevalence of different findings among the three different groups. Two representative cases of suicidal LAD patients are described. In the case reviews, identifying information was removed to conceal identities. In the nonfatal case, written consent was obtained for publication. In the fatal case, written consent from the next of kin was obtained for publication.",

I only drank a small amount of the scotch; the bottle was still nearly full. I have never been a big drinker and as a result I fell asleep on the beach. I woke up the next day wondering how I got there and why and drove back to the base and turned myself in for Away Without Leave (AWOL).

Studies previously discussed demonstrated persistent suicidal ideations were present in 33%, 69% (with intrusive symptoms), 18% and 43% in the chart review in this article.21,28,117 I shall use the most restrictive number of 18% of posttreatment Lyme disease patients having suicidal ideations which calculates to 414,540 LAD patients with suicidal ideations.117 When using this number with the suicidality ratio of 0.3% with suicidal ideations of committing suicide per year and other ratios, it calculates to 1,244 suicides, 14,928 self-harm events, 31,100 suicide attempts, and 414,540 patients with suicidal ideations in the US per year from LAD, based on indirect calculations.5 This number would be higher when adding undiagnosed and untreated cases with persistent symptoms and when adding those attributed to the coinfections and other associated diseases that may be seen in patients with Lyme disease.",
