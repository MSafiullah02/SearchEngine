This unit focuses on immunosuppression, which can be defined as a reduced ability of the immune system to respond to a challenge from a level considered normal, regardless of whether clinical disease results. Immunosuppression may be inherited or acquired, and the impacts on wellbeing range from mild (e.g., slightly reduced response to vaccination that does not impact resistance to disease) to severe (e.g., greatly increased susceptibility to common and opportunistic pathogens and certain cancers). In the regulatory setting, severe suppression following xenobiotic exposure is unlikely.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Experimental animal models provide an opportunity to establish reliable data concerning absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, and to perform informative immune tests that cannot be conducted in humans. However, the reliability of extrapolating these findings across species may be of concern. A review of studies that address the qualitative and quantitative relationships between immune parameters and disease is contained herein. Initially, the most likely clinical consequences that may occur as a result of chronic mild-to-moderate immunosuppression are described, as well as nonimmune factors that may modify these disease outcomes. Clinical and experimental animal studies that have examined immunosuppression-disease relationships are reviewed, and quantitative relationships, when available, are delineated to help address gaps in human health risk assessment. To address the potential social and economic consequences that could result from immunotoxicity, a brief description of the general impact of infectious disease is provided on these parameters. The most comprehensive databases that address severe immunodeficiency diseases, specifically primary (genetic) immunodeficiency and AIDS, are not discussed in detail, as these represent extreme examples of immunosuppression, and neither the specific clinical diseases that result nor the eventual outcomes have much in common to that which occurs in individuals with chronic mild-to-moderate immunosuppression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Insufficient responses to infectious agents are an obvious consequence of maladaptive immunity, but altered immune function can affect the etiology, progression, and/or severity of a broader range of disorders, including autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Estab-lishing the quantitative relationship between altered immune responses and frequency or severity of disease in human populations is challenging, as humans are genetically dissimilar and heterogeneous from an environmental exposure and lifestyle standpoint (House, 2010) . The latter are affected by life stage, sex, use of certain medications, drug/alcohol use, smoking history, stress, lifestyle, occupation, and nutritional status. In combination, these factors account for the variability reported in mean immune values for human populations. This is summarized schematically in Figure 18.1.1 , where the appearance, progression, and outcome of infectious disease is viewed as an interrelationship between the virulence of the organism, infectious dose (number of organisms required to produce illness), integrity of the host's anatomical and functional barriers, and overall immunocompetence of the individual. Another challenge when establishing quantitative associations between changes in immune function and disease is to account for the functional overlap (i.e., redundancy) that exists among the various immune responses and disease. Redundancy is the ability of one or more pathways of the immune system to compensate for a defect in other pathways (Nish and Medzhitov, 2011) . The effects of redundancy can help to elucidate specific immune targets of xenobiotics or infectious agents (Nish and Medzhitov, 2011) .

Thus, infections with extracellular or facultative intracellular organisms are more frequent in individuals with impaired phagocytic mechanisms (e.g., neutropenia) or when humoral immune deficiencies are present.

Common pathogens occur in the general population at frequencies associated with their infectious nature (e.g., virulence, ease of transmission), as represented by viruses that cause influenza infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The respiratory system is the most vulnerable target for common pathogens, as it is directly exposed to the external environment and has a large surface area: four times the combined total surface area of the gastrointestinal tract and skin (Gardner, 2001) . Upper respiratory infections occur in all age groups but produce the most severe effects in the very young and elderly due to their lessened immunocompetence relative to other ages.

In healthy individuals, the immune system maintains viral latency, with cellular immunity playing a major role. When the cellular immune response is compromised, viral replication can ensue and potentially cause severe complications or death. Preceding viral activation, a vigorous immune response to viral-specific antigens occurs in response to replication.

Suppression of cellmediated immunity has been associated with higher incidences of skin cancers, leukemias, and lymphoproliferative disorders in transplant patients, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma and EBV-associated B cell lymphomas are associated with severe immunosuppression as seen in patients with AIDS. Natural killer (NK) cells are more likely to play a role in resisting the progression and metastatic spread of tumors once they develop, rather than preventing initiation (Herberman, 2001) . Unexpectedly, studies of individuals with NK cell deficiency states, most of which are associated with single gene mutations, have helped identify a role for NK cells in defense against human infectious disease.

There are also disadvantages, as ethical considerations provide little opportunity for exposure to xenobiotics. Furthermore, studies with extensive biological monitoring and functional immune tests can be expensive, and exposures as well as outcomes of interest may be difficult to study in the available time frame as study participants are not typically available for long-term exposures or extended follow-up. For the purpose of obtaining data for immunotoxicological risk assessment, clinical studies are particularly useful as they can provide data on the frequency of infections or the level of immune response to vaccines.

In addition to high costs, observational studies are challenging for many reasons, including potential confounding by host (age, sex, and lifestyle) and environmental (frequency of exposure to xenobiotics and infectious agents) factors. A secondary measure of control in observational studies is through the use of multivariable analysis techniques (e.g., regression modeling), provided there is sufficient sample size and information on potential confounders.

In some instances, body burdens of chemicals have been determined, but drawing broadly applicable conclusions from some of these studies is challenging. Subjects have often been exposed to multiple xenobiotics, including those specifically addressed by the study as well as others, and characterization of chemical exposure may rely on subject recall or rough estimates of the duration and intensity of exposure. Furthermore, in contrast to experimental animals, functional assessment may be considerably more difficult in humans as it requires antigen challenge, which involves some risk to the individual. When such studies have been undertaken, subjects have been provided commercial vaccines, such as hepatitis antigen (Weisglas-Kuperus al., 2000; van Loveren et al., 2001; Yucesoy et al., 2001; Sleijffers et al., 2003) , influenza vaccine (Looker et al., 2014) , or common childhood vaccines (Granum et al., 2013) .

In most epidemiological studies, testing in humans has been limited to blood collection, where peripheral cell counts and differentials, immunoglobulin levels, or immunophenotyping are performed.

In a study of Inuit infants in Arctic Quebec, Canada (Dewailly et al., 2000) , the relative risk of recurrent episodes (at least three per year) of otitis media was higher in breast-fed infants in the second and third highest percentile of organochlorine exposure, compared to the lowest. At 3 months of age, breastfed infants with higher exposure levels had lower numbers of white blood cells and lymphocytes and lower serum IgA levels at ages 7 and 12 months, compared to bottle-fed infants. In Dutch preschool children (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000) , PCB levels in breast milk (nonortho-and planar PCBs) were also associated with increased recurrent otitis media and other symptoms of respiratory infection. In this sample, the body burden of PCBs at age 42 months was associated with higher prevalence of recurrent otitis media and chicken pox. PCB body burden was not associated with differences in lymphocyte markers outside the normal range for age-matched children, although levels in breast milk and cord blood were positively correlated with lymphocyte counts and various T cell subsets. While these findings linking otitis media with PCB exposure are consistent across three studies, it was not possible to determine whether the changes in immune parameters mediated this association or simply represented parallel findings.

Although some studies have described associations between pesticide exposures, altered immune functions, and increased rates of infection, sample sizes were generally small and, in some cases, patients were self-selected based on symptoms rather than exposure. Furthermore, the frequency of infections was typically estimated by recall over several years and immune function data were scarce. Not all studies had these shortcomings. For example, a relatively large (n = 1600) and well-defined population living in and around Aberdeen, North Carolina, near a pesticide dump site (a priority Superfund site containing organochlorine pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and metals), was evaluated for immune function and frequency of viral infections. Compared to a neighboring community, residents of Aberdeen, ages 18 to 40 years, were found to have a higher incidence of herpes zoster (reactivated herpes infection causing shingles), but no difference in the frequency of other infectious diseases (Arndt et al., 1999) . In a substudy of 302 individuals, those living in Aberdeen had significantly higher ageadjusted levels of plasma DDE than those living in neighboring communities. Furthermore, higher levels of plasma DDE were related to lower lymphocyte responses to mitogens but higher absolute lymphocyte counts and IgA levels (Vine et al., 2001) . In a separate analysis, residents living nearer to the pesticide dump site had both a lower lymphocyte response to mitogen stimulation and a greater likelihood of having a lower percentage of CD16 + (NK) cells (<8%, the lower limit of the normal reference range; Vine et al., 2000) . The association seen with reactivated herpes infection is plausible in light of these changes, given that NK cells play an important role in the generation of cytotoxic T cells required to help control viral infections. These studies illustrate several challenges in demonstrating the effects of chemical exposures in a populationbased setting. Although an infectious outcome (zoster) was associated with residential history of chemical exposure in Aberdeen, suggesting immunosuppression related to proximity to the dump sites, the more extensive and expensive immune markers and serum indicators of exposure were only examined in a small subset of the original sample.

Furthermore, CD4:CD8 ratios, while usually within normally reported ranges, can be reduced as much as 40%; and NK cell activity, by 10% to 25% below control values.

In studies involving influenza vaccinations, Alzheimer's disease caregivers responded less favorably to vaccination, with only 12 (38%) compared to 21 controls (66%) showing a four-fold increase in antibody titer following immunization.

A smaller but more detailed study by Storek et al.

The significant association between disease and decreased CD4 + T cell counts was primarily dependent upon activated cells, rather than memory T cell subpopulations. In comparing the efficacy of allogeneic marrow transplantation to blood stem cell transplantation, Storek et al.

In studies conducted by Small et al. (1999) , which monitored immune cell recovery following bone marrow cell transplantation, the incidence of infections also correlated with CD4 + cell counts.

The relationship between CD4 + cell numbers and respiratory virus infections was examined over a 3-to 6-month period following transplantation in a small group of T cell depleted (using anti-CD52 antibody treatment) stem cell recipients (Chakrabarti et al., 2001) . The relationship between CD4 + T cell numbers and the incidence of respiratory virus infection was relatively linear.

Although infection rates range between 65% and 70% during the first 6 months post-transplantation, with CMV representing 18% to 67% of the reported infections (Sia and Paya, 1998) , the first month following transplantation is characterized by the occurrence of infections (Kawecki et al., 2014) . With the advent of long-term monitoring, an increased incidence in cancer has also been noted in this population. For example, the risk of developing skin tumors following renal transplantation is 10% after 10 years and 40% after 20 years, while the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is 250-fold higher and for basal cell carcinoma 10-fold higher than the general population (Hartevelt et al., 1990) . The initial immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplant consists generally of a combination cyclosporin (CsA), azathioprine, and steroid cocktail. Therapies are subsequently reduced, but adjusted based upon the time following transplant, evidence of acute rejection, evidence of toxicity (usually serum creatinine levels), and white blood cell count, the latter of which is maintained above 4000 cells/mm 3 . Jamil et al. (1999) , examining 478 renal transplant patients, showed that the risk of lymphomas and infections during the first 6 months post-transplantation increased proportionally with the level of immunosuppressive therapy ranging from 1.5-to 3-fold. Urinary tract infections, which are associated with the transplant, were the most common type of infection in all groups, while severe bacterial infections (pneumonia and septicemia) and systemic/invasive fungal infections were almost exclusively associated with those on the most intensive immunosuppressive therapy. A high incidence of CMV antibodies occurred in all three groups with 9%, 29%, and 53% seroconverting, based upon the level of immunosuppressive therapy. In contrast to infectious diseases, there were fewer cases of squamous and basal cell carcinomas in the most aggressively treated group compared to the other groups, probably due to the anti-proliferative effects of some of the therapeutics. Wieneke et al. (1996) , when also examining renal transplant patients, demonstrated that reduced IgG1 subclass levels and CD4 T cell counts were the best predictors for infections; relative risk increased from 9% in patients with normal values to 38% with lower values.

Host resistance assays are therefore most useful in validating results of single-parameter studies and extrapolation of animal results to host susceptibility in the human population (Burleson and Burleson, 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1119, "end": 1148, "text": "(Burleson and Burleson, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1362, "text": "(Burleson and Burleson, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 642, "end": 652, "text": "(Table 18.", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL MODELS"}, {"text": "Several studies have addressed relationships between changes in immune measurements and host resistance tests routinely used in rodent studies (as reviewed in Germolec, 2003) . While it is rare for a single component of the immune system to be solely responsible for resistance to a specific infectious agent or tumor type, certain immune measures show significant correlations with the outcomes of individual host resistance assays. For example, reduction in NK cell activity has been correlated with increased susceptibility to challenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, B16F10 melanoma cells, and murine CMV (Luster et al., 1988; Selgrade et al., 1992; Luster et al., 1993) .

This can be achieved via targeted gene disruption resulting in animals deficient in specific cell populations or soluble mediators that contribute to host defense (e.g., CD4 T cell knockouts), treatment of normal animals with selective toxic agents (e.g., the use of gadolinium chloride to block macrophage function), or administration of neutralizing antibodies against critical cell-specific surface receptors. A study by Wilson et al. (2001) was specifically designed to determine the magnitude of NK cell suppression that would translate into altered resistance in three disease models. The studies were conducted by NK cell depletion with an antibody to the cell surface molecule, Asialo GM1, using a treatment regimen that did not alter other standard immune function tests used in the assessment of immunotoxicity in rodents. These authors demonstrated that at low levels of tumor challenge, an approximate reduction of 50% or more in NK cell activity, now thought to be in-volved primarily in metastatic processes, was required before significant effects on resistance to NK-sensitive tumors could be observed. These studies also demonstrated that the level of suppression needed to alter host resistance was related to the challenge level of the tumor. Conversely, a study that used monoclonal antibodies to effectively deplete CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes found little evidence of altered resistance to challenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, a model which was thought to be dependent on cell-mediated immunity (Weaver et al., 2002) .

Using the prototypical immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone, these authors demonstrated that contrary to what would be expected based on the compound's suppressive effects on cytokine production, T cell function, and NK cell activity, relatively high levels of dexamethasone were needed to decrease resistance to Listeria monocytogenes. At doses that suppressed many immune parameters, an increase in neutrophil numbers, and nitrite production by peritoneal macrophages was Immune System, Diseases, and Risk Assessment 18.1.14 observed. It was suggested that at lower doses of dexamethasone, the significant increase in the concentration of neutrophils in the blood, in conjunction with increased production of nitric oxide, compensated for the decrements in other immune parameters so that overall resistance to the pathogen was not compromised (Keil et al., 2001) . Heryzk et al. (1997) have developed a testing paradigm that evaluates immune function within the context of resistance to a specific infection. Following infection with Candida albicans, a four parameter model is used that includes survival, spleen colony forming units (CFU), muscle CFU, and antibody titers, and which the authors suggest allows an inclusive evaluation of both nonspecific, cell-, and humoral-mediated immune responses. This approach has proved successful in identifying both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory compounds and has the advantage of being able to evaluate multiple immune endpoints in an intact animal and directly relate them to a clinical endpoint. The utility of the method as a screening tool has yet to be evaluated using large numbers of test articles or environmental chemicals; and the procedure is not widely used outside of the pharmaceutical industry, but increasingly, these types of assays are being used to generate reference doses for human safety (Luebke, 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 197, "text": "Keil et al.

It was observed that even immunologically normal animals, provided a sufficient number of tumor cells, develop a high frequency of tumors, and the number of tumor cells required to produce tumors decreased proportionally to the degree of immunosuppression. This was interpreted to indicate that immune function-disease response relationships tended to be linear in nature, rather than threshold. Although it is not possible to confirm these relationships in humans, it was suggested that similar response relationships would also be applicable to humans, albeit with different slopes, provided other modifiers were not present.

It is considerably more difficult to ascertain health consequences from low-tomoderate levels of immunosuppression, as would be most likely to occur from exposure to immunotoxic agents than from severe immunosuppression.

There are insufficient clinical data to determine whether the relationship between a decrease in immune response and an increase in infectious disease follows a linear or threshold relationship in humans.
