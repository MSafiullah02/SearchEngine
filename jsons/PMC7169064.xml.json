While disease is often mild with cold\u2010like symptoms, it can progress to severe presentations such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia requiring hospitalization or resulting in death. RSV accounts for over three million paediatric hospitalizations per year.2 Outgrowth of bacteria known to asymptomatically colonize the upper airway of young children, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, has been reported during viral ARI, often in association with increased disease severity.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 The contribution of viral/bacterial co\u2010infections to disease severity has been well\u2010documented in co\u2010infections caused by influenza viruses and S. pneumoniae in adults,15 however, the role of bacteria during paediatric viral ARI is less clear.16 Synergistic interactions between respiratory viruses and bacteria have been demonstrated in mechanistic studies, including increased attachment to airway epithelium and enhancement of immune evasion strategies.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Consideration of potentially pathogenic bacteria may be important in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of paediatric ARI.",

Some investigations have shown a clear association between positive bacterial cultures and increased admission, duration of stay and use of supportive care at hospitals and intensive care units,8, 9, 10, 14 while older and generally cross\u2010sectional studies have found no association between viral/bacteria co\u2010detection and markers of disease severity.11, 12, 13, 37, 38 The longitudinal study reported by Teo et al.,5 in which every ARI over the first year of life was captured using culture\u2010independent techniques, clearly demonstrated that colonization by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was associated with more severe lower respiratory infections in the presence of respiratory viruses.
