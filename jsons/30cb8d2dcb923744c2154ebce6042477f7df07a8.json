These pressures include climate change, habitat degradation and fragmentation, invasive species, trade in wildlife, and exposure to emerging pathogens, all of which are associated with the human population growth which surpassed seven billion individuals in 2012. In fact, these anthropogenic changes have led many to contend that the Earth is presently in a new \"Anthropocene\" epoch (Crutzen 2002 ) . Simply stated, humans are the drivers of planetary health.",

Additionally, with an estimated 50 % increase in animalbased protein for human consumption by the year 2020, it is inevitable that human use of resources will continue to rise (Delgado et al. 2001 ) . Lastly, the estimated billions of live wildlife animals and animal products, including NHP, that are traded annually also place heavy burdens that threaten the long-term survival of species (Rosen and Smith 2010 ) . In addition to the direct impacts of the wildlife trade on conservation are the potentially devastating impacts from cross-species microbial mixing and exposure to novel pathogens.",

Diseases have ecological impacts on multiple scales, affecting individuals (survival, reproduction), populations (population size, gene fl ow), communities (shifts in dominant or abundant species, changes in species composition), and ecosystems (changes in ecosystem structure, function, and resilience) (Deem et al. 2008 ) . All these potential disease-related impacts should be considered in NHP conservation initiatives, since an increasing number of disease events have been demonstrated to infl uence NHP populations (Wallis 2000 ) .

Although there are a number of defi nitions for conservation medicine, at the core is the realization that the health of environments, and the animals and people within, are intimately related. Conservation medicine may best be defi ned as a transdisciplinary approach to study the relationship between human, animal, and ecosystem health to ensure the conservation of all biodiversity, including Homo sapiens (Koch 1996 ; Deem et al. 2000 ; Aguirre et al. 2002 ; Jakob-Hoff and Warren 2012 ; Deem 2015 ) . In its simplest form, it is the application of medicine to augment the conservation of wildlife and ecosystems, while ensuring human public health. A conservation medicine approach may involve the documentation, evaluation, monitoring, modifying, and/or prevention of diseases in wildlife (Deem et al. 2001 ) . Following on the heels of this holistic conservation medicine approach, for planetary health care was a \"new\" initiative termed One Health .",

However, the veterinary community also now embraces One Health, and indeed historically, it was a veterinary epidemiologist who coined the term One Medicine in the midtwentieth Century (Schwabe 1984 ; Gibbs 2014 ) . Many view this term as the building block for both conservation medicine and One Health. And if one wishes to go further in history, it was as early as the 1800s that a physician, Rudolf Virchow stated \"Between animal and human medicine, there is no dividing line-nor should there be\" (Klauder 1958 ) .",

In fact, an early defi nition of the One Health concept stated that One Health is an initiative that aims to merge animal and human health science to benefi t both (Enserink 2007 ) . This defi nition, with the lack of ecosystem as one component of the triad, may miss the underlying, \"Anthropocene\" drivers of the health concerns that increasingly threaten human and animal health and biodiversity conservation . However, similar to conservation medicine, there have been a number of newer defi nitions of One Health that factor ecosystem health alongside humans and animals. One unifying theme has been that One Health is a strategy that strives to expand transdisciplinary collaborations and communications to improve health care for humans, animals, and the environment (Kahn et al. 2012 ). This defi ning theme is rather analogous to conservation medicine and thus semantics aside, we may see One Health and conservation medicine as two names for across discipline strategies to improve health care for the planet. In this chapter, we will call this holistic health care approach, focusing across ecosystems, animals and humans, conservation medicine since our primary objective is the long-term conservation of NHP species globally.",

In fact, anthropogenic global modifi cations are the most important variables associated with disease events in wildlife, including NHP, today (Dobson and Foufopoulos 2001 ) . As the threat of EID has become a tangible risk for NHP and human public health, this area of study has become increasingly important within NHP conservation (Wolfe et al. 1998 ; Wallis and Lee 1999 ; Wallis 2000 ; Daszak et al. 2000 ; Chapman et al. 2005 ) . Zoonotic pathogensthose agents shared between animals and humans-comprise 60.3 % of EIDs in humans, and of these, 71.8 % have originated from wildlife hosts and include sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , avian infl uenza, Ebola, monkeypox, and West Nile virus (Jones et al. 2008 ) . Although all animals may serve as a reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, NHP are one of the most common taxa to share infectious agents with humans.",

An expression of this lack of a barrier is that primates constitute only 0.5 % of all vertebrate species but have contributed about 20 % of our major human diseases (Wolfe et al. 2007 ). Conversely, it has been well documented that infection with human pathogens may have fatal consequences for immunologically na\u00efve NHP in captivity (Ruch 1959 ; Brack 1987 ) . Now there is evidence of similar events, with potentially catastrophic effects, in free-living NHP populations (Wolfe et al. 1998 ; Wallis and Lee 1999 ; Leroy et al. 2004 ). Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas, as the NHP most phylogenetically similar to humans, are also the most highly susceptible to human pathogens, especially viruses (Benirschke and Adams 1980 ; Brack 1987 ; Ott-Joslin 1993 ; Wallis and Lee 1999 ; Wolfe et al. 1998 ; Murphy 2012 ; Gilardi et al. 2014 ) .",

Therefore, a fi rst step in understanding the role of pathogens in primate ecology is by surveillance to improve our knowledge of primate pathogens and their occurrence in natural populations (Nunn and Altizer 2005 ) . Data gleaned from surveillance programs that may be crucial for conservation efforts include knowing which pathogens are present, what percentage of any given population is infected, and how these pathogens impact NHP population viability (e.g., morbidity and mortality). Yet these data are still sadly limited. For example, even in lemurs, a taxa with a number of critically endangered species, the fi rst exogenous viruses of any lemur species were just described (Lim et al. 2015 ) .",

Programs such as the USAID PREDICT project will help to determine pathogen presence and provide missing data necessary for zoonoses preparedness, while gathering data important for conservation (Morse et al. 2012 ) . Other programs such as the Great Ape Health Monitoring Unit (GAHMU) is a transdisciplinary approach for the diagnoses of pathogens in great apes, with an objective to create a long term, systematic sampling system (Leendertz et al. 2006 ) . This program provides detailed health monitoring on wild great ape populations to establish baseline infectious agent exposure data of healthy animals, as well as to determine pathogens potentially causing morbidity and mortality. Similar surveillance programs exist for NHP populations in Asia and South America (Engel et al. 2006 ; Vitazkova 2009 ; Araj\u00fajo et al. 2013 ) . In fact, it is in Asia, with temple monkeys, and South America, with urban green centers providing habitat that may harbor a growing number of NHP, that close proximity of NHP and humans is increasing and the surveillance of pathogens in these populations is imperative.",

            "text": "Disease Risk Analysis is another conservation medicine approach that has gained momentum in recent years to help with our understanding of the health challenges that threaten wildlife conservation (Deem 2012 ) . Disease risk analysis is a formal procedure for estimating the likelihood and consequences of adverse effects occurring in a specifi c population, taking into consideration exposure to potential hazards and the nature of their effects (Thrusfi eld 2007 ). Components of a disease risk analysis consist of four interconnected phases: (1) hazard identifi cation, (2) risk assessment, (3) risk management, and (4) risk communication (Thrusfi eld 2007 ; Deem 2012 ) . All the phases are interactive with the others, and therefore the process should be iterative and not simply fl ow from phase 1 to 4. Hazard identifi cation may be viewed as the identifi cation of what may go wrong. It is important to identify what diseases have potential effects harmful enough to warrant inclusion in the disease risk analysis. These hazards may be infectious (e.g., Ebola virus) or noninfectious (e.g., snare wounds), with the criteria for inclusion in the disease risk analysis dependent on the potential for negative impacts. Risk assessment is the range of calculations required to estimate release, exposure, and consequence parameters for infectious diseases, or for noninfectious diseases the likelihood and consequences of a disease occurring in a population. Risk management provides conservationists with a focus on those responses that may decrease the likelihood of an adverse outcome and/or reduce the consequences if such an outcome occurs. This element of risk analysis may best be viewed as the reason for performing the analysis so that science may move into action. The fourth component, risk communication is a continuous process, necessitating respectful communication among the multiple stakeholders throughout the risk analysis (Offi ce of International Epizootics 2004 ). For a more in-depth discussion of this important tool for non-human primate conservation, please see Thrusfi eld ( 2007 ) and Deem ( 2012 ) .",

The analysis enumerates various factors, including a better understanding of disease threats to an endangered species, a guide to improve health data collection, and proper risk communication to advance highquality health care standards. A second study was derived from a workshop on Southeast Asian Macaque Risk Analysis. Field and laboratory data and expert opinion were combined to develop a model to predict transmission of simian foamy virus between temple macaques and humans accurately (Engel et al. 2006 ) .

These centers often provide humane care for injured and confi scated NHP. Unfortunately, the close human to NHP contact at these sanctuaries and centers may lead to zoonotic disease issues, and conservation challenges if repatriated NHP carry human pathogens back into the wild. For example, a confi scated juvenile eastern lowland gorilla that had signifi cant human contact during care was diagnosed with a clinical case of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (Gilardi et al. 2014 ) . As a potentially chronic infection, the release of this gorilla back to the wild could serve as a vehicle of introduction of a human pathogen into the free-living population. The need for these centers to provide health care using a conservation medicine approach that ensures healthy animals and healthy people is being increasingly supported ( http://www.pasaprimates.org/ accessed January 24, 2015).",

The use of NHP for food and within the pet trade places serious pressures on free-living populations while also providing a perfect vehicle for pathogen transmission between NHP and humans. The benefi t of understanding this risk of pathogen transmission may allow for these data to help establish regulations to limit the trade in NHP. Poverty and hunger complicate the strength of this information. However, using a conservation medicine approach by working for alternative food sources while emphasizing human health, NHP populations may be better protected due in part to knowledge of zoonotic disease concerns (Golden et al. 2014) .",

The need to perform ecotourism in a manner that does not harm the very NHP that tourists are keen to visit, leads to the need for preventive measures to ensure that the health of both human and NHP participants is not jeopardized. In the case of great ape ecotourism, which necessitates habituation, the stress of human proximity as well as the potential for zoonoses and anthropozoonoses makes the need for a conservation medicine approach imperative (Nutter and Whittier 2001 ; Woodford et al. 2002 ; Macfi e and Williamson 2010 ).",

These mostly anthropogenic threats, from habitat degradation to hunting to zoonoses/anthropozoonoses may differ depending on the species of NHP and/or geographical region, but most present serious health concerns for free-living NHP populations. The continuum from infectious disease epidemics, that may extirpate entire populations, to the more chronic stressors of habitat degradation and human encroachment, decreasing immunity and reproductive success, demand a conservation medicine approach. Additionally, with the zoonotic link between NHP and humans, which is predicted to become more serious as stable ecosystems and large genetically diverse populations of NHP are increasingly stressed by humans, the need for a conservation medicine approach has never been more urgent. Transdisciplinary conservation medicine teams may include ecologists, primatologists, veterinary and medical professionals, sociologists, anthropologists, and politicians, along with local stakeholders and laypersons. These teams are necessary to achieve the primary goal of minimizing the human created stressors and diseases that threaten the survival of NHP. As they say, \"it takes a village.\"",
