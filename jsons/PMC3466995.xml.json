In addition to these factors, there is evidence that patterns of infectious diseases are also different in urban infants, and this prompted us to comprehensively compare the etiology of viral respiratory illnesses and infections in urban infants to those in suburban infants. Using similar methods for specimen collection and analysis, we found that illnesses in urban infants were less likely to be associated with common respiratory viruses, such as HRV and RSV. In contrast, infections with adenovirus, either alone or with other viruses, were significantly more common in the urban population, and this held true for each of the 4 urban locations where our study was conducted.",

In the Danish study, detection of one of these respiratory pathogens in the first 3 years of life was associated with wheezing, and the strength of this association was similar in magnitude to that observed with detection of a respiratory virus (odds ratio, 2.9 vs 2.8).

Adenoviruses most frequently cause either respiratory symptoms, gastroenteritis, or keratoconjunctivitis, and the viral diagnostic tests in our study focused on detection of B, C, and E species, which are most closely associated with respiratory illness. The severity of illness is also strain dependent; B viruses more often cause lower respiratory tract illnesses, while C viruses that were predominant in this study are more likely to cause cold symptoms. In hospital-based studies of bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children, adenoviruses caused 7%\u201315% of illnesses, and in 60%\u201380% of these illnesses adenovirus was detected with another virus [14, 16\u201318]. In outpatient illnesses, the contribution of adenovirus infection is more variable. Kusel and colleagues reported virology data for the first year of life in 263 children participating in a birth cohort study in Perth, Australia [19]. Adenoviruses were detected infrequently in either symptomatic infants (1.4%) or asymptomatic infants (0.4%), and these findings were similar to those from a second study of infants studied as outpatients in the United Kingdom [20]. Notably, the demographic characteristics of the Perth cohort closely resemble those of the COAST cohort, in which white race and mid-to-high socioeconomic status predominated. In contrast, one large study found higher adenovirus detection rates among young children studied as outpatients. Chonmaitree and colleagues studied 294 children aged 6 months to 3 years in Galveston, Texas, and found adenovirus by PCR in 24.1% of samples obtained during colds (including 13% of samples in which adenovirus was the only pathogen) [21]. The reason for the high rate of adenovirus infections was not stated, although it is of interest that the demographic characteristics of the study population (56% Hispanic or Latino and 31% Black) were more similar to the URECA cohort than to the COAST cohort. A number of children had adenovirus detected more than once, and sequence analysis showed that, in 81% of cases, this represented a chronic infection rather than reinfection with a different adenovirus strain [22].",

The observed differences in the etiology of respiratory illnesses could influence the patterns of acute illness and could also affect long-term outcomes. For example, wheezing illnesses in infancy are an indicator of increased asthma risk, and this risk is further modified by the type of virus causing the wheezing. Adenovirus is of particular interest relative to long-term outcomes because acute infections can lead to viral shedding for weeks or months [22]. Since both the immune system and the lungs are rapidly developing in infancy [27], chronic infections could influence these developmental processes, leading to long-term changes in lung and/or immune function. Relationships between infections with specific viruses (including adenoviruses) in infancy and incident asthma will be analyzed in the URECA study when the children are 7 years of age.",

Comparison to the COAST cohort is facilitated by the use of similar illness ascertainment and sampling methods and by use of the same viral diagnostic system [12]. The COAST and URECA studies both enrolled children with a family history of allergies or asthma, and there could be differences between patterns of respiratory illness in these children and patterns in the general population. The demographic characteristics of the cohorts are quite different, and since there are major differences in socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and lifestyle (Table 1), one limitation of the study is that multivariate analysis to determine which of these specific factors contribute to the different patterns of respiratory illnesses and pathogens is not possible. An additional limitation is that the samples from the 2 cohorts were collected 7 years apart. Since the samples collected in Madison yielded differences with all 4 of the urban centers and because continued monitoring in the COAST cohort has revealed persistently low rates of adenovirus isolation ([3] and unpublished data), the temporal difference is unlikely to account for the observed differences.",

These findings could influence acute and chronic respiratory health, and within the ongoing URECA study, the children will be carefully monitored for effects on asthma until the age of 7 years. These findings also raise additional questions about the etiology of respiratory symptoms in urban infants, particularly with respect to the cause of the respiratory illnesses for which no viruses were detected. Additional study of these samples by use of new broad-based genomic analysis techniques could provide further insight into this important area of unmet medical need.",
