Over two years of talks, the Bush Administration opposed proposals for mandatory tobacco taxes, fought provisions mandating secondhand smoke protections, attempted to weaken proposals to restrict tobacco advertising, and rejected prohibitions on the use of deceptive terms such as \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 (Waxman, 2002). At one point, the Administration supported ten of eleven deletions that U.S. tobacco company Philip Morris wanted made to the draft treaty text (Waxman, 2001; http://www.house.gov/reform/min/inves_tobacco/index_accord.htm, accessed 20 February 2004). When challenged on the science behind its positions, the Administration made several dubious legal arguments, including the false claim that the United States could not accept any treaty provision requiring additional legislation from Congress (Waxman, 2003b; http://www.house.gov/reform/min/inves_tobacco/index_accord.htm, accessed 20 February, 2004).",
