If a trait differs from young controls only in the last 10% of the cohort to drop off, then it's hard to be confident that the change is a result of aging rather than of the advanced disease or diseases most typical in the stock under study. After all, the aging process, which creates decrepit old mice from healthy, fit, young ones, takes many months to do this, and age-dependent changes in many cells, tissue, and organ systems can usually be demonstrated well before the median survival time for the species or stock. If your assay shows no change at 18, 22, 26, or 30 months of age (in a stock with a median survival of 24 months), then demonstrating a change in 34-month-old animals may well be due to sickness per se. Judicious selection of ages for initial exploratory work may depend on the specific characteristics of the stock to be used, and stocks with median survivals of 22 months or of 30 months may call for adjustments of ages selected for initial examination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "(b) Old mice are very expensive, particularly if you want them to be disease-free. The problem is that the real production cost of mice rises not linearly with chronologic age, but instead in proportion to the mortality rate, i.e., as an expo-nential function of age. If half your mice live to age 24 months, then producing a single 24-month-old mouse requires you to pay someone to house two mice for 24 months, one of which has just died. If only 10% of the mice survive to age 32 months, then the real cost of each 32month-old mouse is the cost of raising 10 mice for anywhere from 18 to 32 months to get the one alive at 32 months.

Because half of the 2-year-old mice are found to have advanced neoplasia even at a cursory necropsy, the cost of a more-or-less tumor-free 2-year-old mouse is another twofold higher, or $414.

The real subsidy (production cost minus cost to you) rises exponentially with age, however, and therefore it costs much more to raise a very old mouse in one's own facility than it does to buy them from NIA.

T Even 2-3-month-old mice, the biological equivalent of teenagers and college freshmen, i.e., technically postpubertal but hardly adult, are still in the throes of complex maturational changes we may wish to distinguish from the aging process. Although differences between 2-month-old and 5-month-old mice may be well worth studying, and in some cases may be highly relevant to aging (thymic involution, for example, is well advanced by 5 months of age), a conservative strategy might be to use mice aged 4-6 months as the \"young\" control group in experimental comparisons.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Third Principle: Don't use too few age groups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "It is certainly cheaper to do your initial survey experiment with only two age groups, e.g., 6 and 24 months, but there are major risks of missing interesting effects, and equal risks of reporting positive results whose significance would be routinely misinterpreted without data on intermediate ages.

The most common mouse pathogens endemic in conventional colonies are Sendai virus, Coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus), and pinworm, whereas rat colonies are most often infected with sialodacryoadenitis virus, Sendai, and Mycoplasma pulmonis (R. Dysko, DVM, personal communication). The methods required for maintenance of an SPF rodent vivarium are beyond the scope of this article, and are well reviewed elsewhere (2) . Key steps include: never allowing in animals, from any source, that have not been proven to be SPF; never taking animals out of the colony and allowing them to return; never allowing visitors, even site visitors and deans, to enter the colony; never letting anyone into the colony who does not need to be there; and the routine but obsessive use of precautions like gloves, gowns, and shoe covers. Some facilities use an expensive barrier system, in which each room has a clean door (through which supplies and clean personnel enter) and a dirty door (through which used cages leave). Others have almost equal luck with commercially available single-cage filter bonnets that greatly reduce the risk of cage-to-cage transmission of airborne microbes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 675, "end": 678, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "These operating procedures, although necessary, are not sufficient to earn the right to refer to your colony as SPF; the colony must be proven to be free of key pathogens by routine testing of surveillance mice, for example on a quarterly basis. A minimal surveillance program involves introducing several cages of new mice, without filter bonnets, into each room every three months, using a stock (CD-1, for example) known to be susceptible to many common pathogens. These mice are then tested after 90 days, a period of time sufficient to allow them to become infected by anything in circulation, and to have developed antibodies to the infectious agent. The mice are then euthanized, examined carefully for evidence of intestinal and external parasites, and their sera tested (often by a commercial laboratory) for evidence of antiviral antibodies specific for the agents of interest. Periodic histopathological analysis is also recommended. If all tests come back negative, then you can call the colony SPF. Positive responses should induce a panicky feeling and a vigorous retesting effort, and repeat positives usually require that the entire affected colony be discarded and rederived. If this surveillance system is not practicable in a given institutional vivarium, a useful alternative is to keep a small number of weanlings from breeding cage until they are about 3 months old and then to send these to a commercial facility for testing. Because the breeding pairs are usually long-term residents of the facility, and newborn pups are particularly sensitive to infection, this procedure is more sensitive than buying mice and allowing them simply to reside in the colony for a few months without contact with the local residents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The optimal situation for maintaining an SPF colony combines the use of filter bonnets with the use of sentinel mice. Because filters work very well in preventing spread of airborne pathogens, exposure of the sentinel animals to potentially infectious agents requires a procedure in which the used bedding from a pool of cages be thoroughly mixed, and then added to the cages containing the sentinels. (A policemouse's life is not a happy one.) Sentinels who put up with this treatment for several months are then volunteered for necropsy and serological analysis. In these circumstances a stray positive result may not require sacrifice of the entire colony, because it is more likely that the infection has been confined to one or two cages; detailed follow-up studies may document good health for the majority of mice in the room.

Because many infections can alter a mouse's immune, hepatic, endocrine, digestive, pulmonary, and neurological responses, studies carried out on conventional colonies can prove very difficult to reproduce in another, or even in the same, laboratory. In some cases allegations of age effects on variables of interest have proven to occur only in conventional colonies (3), and are thus likely to reflect unsuspected influences of one or more uncharacterized infectious agents than of aging itself. Most effects of this kind doubtless go undetected, because few workers routinely use mice from two distinct colonies, one conventional and the other SPF. It seems likely, however, that many of the unnerving conflicts among reports in the gerontological literature may reflect variations in colony pathogen status.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Successful maintenance of an SPF colony also requires sufficient discipline to prevent the importation of new mouse stocks from uncertified suppliers. A well-run colony will usually permit unfettered importation of mice from only a very small number of commercial vendors, vendors that routinely submit clean bills of health with all shipments. A request for permission to bring in animals from an uncertified vendor or another research institution should trigger a process in which the sender is required to document the health status of the animals, and in which even allegedly clean animals are kept in a separate quarantine facility (or building) until tested locally for pathogens before they or their offspring are introduced into the general population.

F1 hybrids created by a cross between two different inbred lines are almost invariably longer-lived than either of the two parents (7), consistent with the notion that the homozygous condition produces an animal of lower quality.

At the NIA subsidized cost, you'll pay a mere $72 a head for the old mice, or $144 per tumor-free old mouse, and $22 per young one; so you'll save a mere $454-less cost, and less savings than the home-grown variety, but still worth the cost of writing down the following formulas, which were derived by Andrzej Galecki of the University of Michigan's Geriatrics Center and Institute of Gerontology:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Seventh Principle: Don't pool unless you absolutely have to."}, {"text": "Here's what to do: first do the regular old power analysis, that tells you how many mice you'll need if you use equal numbers of mice in each group.

Consider, for example, a hypothetical situation in which an investigator is interested in testing the hypothesis that the relatively low ability of T cells from old mice to secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2) contributes to their low ability to make antibodies when injected with tumor cells. The investigator tests a group of mice, containing equal numbers of old and young animals, for both IL-2 and antibody production, and obtains the results shown in the left panel of Figure 2 . He interprets this as good support for the idea that low IL-2 levels are indeed associated with poor antibody production, and because he knows from prior work that T cells from old mice do indeed make less IL-2 than cells from young mice, he concludes that the low IL-2 levels may underlie the poor antibody production.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 524, "end": 532, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Seventh Principle: Don't pool unless you absolutely have to."}, {"text": "The error in this inference is that the correlation between IL-2 and antibody production could well reflect the common influence on aging on both outcomes, rather than any direct connection between IL-2 production and antibody responses.
