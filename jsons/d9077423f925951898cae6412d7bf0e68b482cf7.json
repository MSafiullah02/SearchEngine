Recent Findings Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic have opened the door for investigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. Summary Each current vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is paramount that multiple strategies be advanced quickly and then evaluated for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the safety studies to minimize undesired immunopotentiation will become the most significant bottleneck in terms of time.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, linked initially to animal-to-human transmission in local wet markets. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission of the virus commenced, resulting in widespread respiratory illness in Wuhan and other urban areas of Hubei Province, China. The coronavirus then spread across China and at least 20 other nations [1] . On February 11, the World Health Organization named the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the syndrome was named COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019 [2] . Although not as lethal as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, COVID-19 is still characterized by severe respiratory illness and significant mortality, especially among individuals over the age of 60 years and in those with underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension [1] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible with an estimated reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2.2, i.e., one infected individual is estimated to transmit the virus to 2.2 other individuals, and a mean incubation period of 5.8 days [1] . The finding that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from infected individuals without symptoms [3] , together with its ability to cause pandemic disease within a period of weeks, suggests that control of this viral infection will be challenging without the prospect of a vaccine. Here we provide a brief overview of some of the major candidates and the challenges of implementing vaccine strategies. Since much of the information about these vaccines has not yet entered the peerreviewed literature, for this brief overview, we rely significantly on the information made publicly available on websites and other documents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 846, "end": 849, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1085, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1177, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Like the SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have originated from bats before infecting one or more mammal species sold in Wuhan animal markets.

Therefore, such populations might be prioritized for vaccine clinical trials or licensure. Still, another feature is the real possibility that a new vaccine for COVID-19 may not be available in time for this current epidemic or pandemic. Therefore, it should be made available for potential stockpiling. Along those lines, vaccines developed and produced for global health security or biodefense are often considered less profitable than traditional childhood and adult vaccines.

In addition, researchers at the University of Hong Kong have developed a live influenza vaccine that expresses SARS-CoV-2 proteins [22] . Finally, Codagenix has developed a \"codon deoptimization\" technology to attenuate viruses [23] and is exploring SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies. A major advantage of whole virus vaccines is their inherent immunogenicity and ability to stimulate toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR 3, TLR 7/8, and TLR 9.

Moreover, Novavax has developed and produced immunogenic virus-like nanoparticles based on recombinant expression of the S-protein [24] while Clover Biopharmaceuticals is developing a subunit vaccine consisted of a trimerized SARS-CoV-2 S-protein using their patented Trimer-Tag\u00ae technology [14] , although some full-length S-proteins for SARS also elicit increased infectivity and eosinophilic infiltration. Accordingly, a consortium led by Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine (including University of Texas Medical Branch and New York Blood Center) has developed and tested a subunit vaccine comprised of only the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV S-protein [7, 25, 26] . When formulated on alum, the SARS-CoV RBD vaccine elicits high levels of protective immunity on the homologous virus challenge. An advantage of the RBD-based vaccine is its ability to minimize host immunopotentiation [7] .

The next few months represent a critical period for determining whether the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan and Central China will spread across Asia and globally, or whether the warmer months of spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere will reduce transmission of typically seasonal coronavirus infections. In the former situation, we will urgently require new vaccines. However, the challenge remains. Moving forward, we must recognize that we have had a new major coronavirus epidemic every decade in the twenty-first century-SARS in the 2000s, MERS in the 2010s, and now COVID-19. It is, therefore, a global security priority to advance and stockpile coronavirus vaccines, and to identify international funding mechanisms to support their development, manufacture, and storage. As a matter of fact, this recent outbreak should serve as a beacon to call upon the international research community to not only react but also prepare for the next coronavirus crossing into mammals.
