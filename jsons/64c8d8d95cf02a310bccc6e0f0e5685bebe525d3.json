This can dramatically35    increase exposure to COVID-19 as the virus can remain airborne viable for longer than three36    hours. 5,6 These compounding risks justify the need to establish clear protocols for physicians 37 performing any nasal procedure.38Nasopharyngoscopy remains one of the most widely performed procedures in 39 otolaryngology. 7 However, given the concerns mentioned previously, in this time of   40    indications to perform nasopharyngoscopy should be judiciously weighed against the potential41 risks. As of March 18, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has limited 42 \"all non-essential planned surgeries and procedures, including dental, until further notice\". Only 43 procedures/surgeries in a high acuity situations or in unstable patients should continue. 8 Some 44 providers have already modified their use of nasopharyngoscopy in perioperative evaluation of 45 patients undergoing endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy. 9 Based on the surgeon general's advice, 46 all elective procedures should be currently halted. Endoscopy at this point should only be 47 considered for emergent/urgent cases, which in the case of endoscopy is likely limited to a very 48 select number of tumor cases and possibly severe refractory epistaxis. Even with these cases, 49 providers should consider utilizing imaging modalities (CT, MRI, CTA) for diagnostic purposes 50 and reserve endoscopy for critical situations where it will have a significant impact on 51 management. 52 In the minority of cases where nasopharyngoscopy cannot be avoided, a protocol has 53 been developed in China and adapted by physicians in the United States. Chinese medical 54 officials recommend three levels of protection during endoscopic procedures. 10 These measures 55 include protective clothing, N95 masks, goggles, face shields, and hand and feet covers. 11 In the 56 US, Stanford University has adapted these guidelines to require wearing a gown, N95 masks, and 57 face shields for all outpatient nasal endoscopies. 12 Additionally, in the outpatient setting, visits 58 have been restricted to urgent/emergent patients and the replacement of aerosol 59 decongestants/anesthetics with nasal pledgets. The above recommendations are also followed for 60 inpatient settings, with the addition of the placement of powered air purifying respirators 61 (PAPRs) for those in the OR as N95s may not be sufficient. 12 This procedure is supported by 62 guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 13 and healthcare agencies 63 in China as the usage of PAPRs may help control viral dissemination. 11,12 Lastly, some 64 institutions have postponed elective surgeries in cases where patients tested positive for COVID-65 19 in the 48 hours prior. These institutions are requiring patients to retest with a negative result 66 before proceeding with the operation. 12 67 Conclusion 68 Considering the current health crisis caused by COVID-19, the following guidelines are 69 recommended for all outpatient nasal endoscopies: Patient visits must be limited to only 70 urgent/emergent cases for the time being. Only vital personnel should remain in the room if 71 performing any nasal endoscopic procedure as this will both reduce exposure and conserve vital 72 personal protective equipment. Three levels of protection are recommended for the person 73 performing the procedure: gown, N95 mask, and face shield. PAPR should be used in place of an 74 N95 if available. Use nasal pled gets in place of aerosol decongestants and anesthetics. In 75 addition, COVID-19 testing prior to emergent surgeries should be performed, with the 76 expectation that the procedures for patients who test positive will be postponed. Finally, just as 77 in office visits,all non-essential personnel should be limited during any emergent ENT surgeries.",
