In May 1987, the Fortieth World Health Assembly endorsed the WHO global strategy for the prevention and control of AIDS and the establishment of a special program on AIDS. It recognized that information and education on the modes of transmission and the availability of safe blood and blood products were still the only measures available to prevent the spread of AIDS. The Health Assembly also described AIDS as an emergency, urged Member States to make contributions in cash and in kind to implement the global strategy and appealed to bilateral and multilateral agencies to support the worldwide fight against AIDS (http://www.who.int/bloodsafety/en/WHA40.26. pdf). Nevertheless, as noted in Fig. 7 .1 in Chap. 7, the total annual resources available to combat AIDS did not increase significantly until 1999, remaining well below USD 1 billion per year from 1986 to 1998. As Fig. 8.1 shows, between the establishment of the WHO AIDS strategy in 1987 and 2005, the estimated number of infections grew from about two million cases to almost forty million. The risk of AIDS infection through the use of blood products was recognized as early as 1982 (http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/hcan-scan/commission_blood_ final_rep-e/vol1-e.pdf). However, as late as January 1987, the WHO passed a resolution on blood products that made no mention of AIDS. Moreover, countries were slow to adopt measures to ensure the safety of the blood supply, as shown in Table 8 .1. In October 1986, the US FDA recommended that blood donor screening (through \"confidential unit exclusion,\" a questionnaire to identify high-risk donors) be implemented throughout the United States. In Canada, confidential unit exclusion was not implemented nationally until the autumn of 1988. The Canadian Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada (known as the Krever Commission) found that the Canadian Red Cross could have done much more to reduce the risk of AIDS transmission through blood products and could have reduce the incidence of transfusion-associated AIDS significantly had it taken more vigorous action based on the available knowledge (http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/20 0/301/hcan-scan/commission_blood_final_rep-e/vol1-e.pdf). France was also slow to adopt effective measures for preventing transfusion-associated AIDS, with the result that France became the Western European country with the highest incidence of AIDS resulting from the use of blood products, between 1985 and 1993. In 1985, the national centre for blood transfusion had made a decision to distribute blood products that were known to be contaminated with HIV (http://epe.lac-bac. gc.ca/100/200/301/hcan-scan/commission_blood_final_rep-e/vol3-e.pdf).",

Nevertheless, between 1948 and 1998, WHO never used its international legal authority under Article 19 and only adopted two regulations under Article 21. The WHO only adopted its first international treaty in 2003 (the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) (Fidler 1998 (2005) , which came into force on 15 June 2007, aim to contain health emergencies at the source, not only at national borders, and apply to all diseases and health events that may constitute a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (http://www.who.int/features/qa/39/en/index.html). The previous IHR (1969) focused on the control at borders and relatively passive notification and control measures. The limited scope of the IHR (1969) , which dealt only with cholera, plague, yellow fever and smallpox, made them irrelevant and ineffective with respect to more recent global public health crises, including HIV/AIDS, SARS and the threat of an influenza pandemic. Moreover, the WHO member states often did not comply with the IHR (1969), by failing to notify the WHO of cases of diseases and applying excessive health measures beyond those permitted by the IHR (1969). The IHR (1969) also limited the WHO's ability to respond to new outbreaks of disease by requiring the WHO to rely on official state notifications, rather than other sources (von Tigerstrom 2005) . For example, the Chinese government proved to be a less timely source of information on the SARS outbreak than email and the internet. While the response to SARS was successful, it highlighted the ineffectiveness of the IHR (von Tigerstrom 2005). The key changes to the IHR are with respect to disease coverage, notification requirements, sources of information that the WHO can use and provisions regarding confidentiality of information provided to the WHO. The IHR (2005) also set standards for public health responses to the international spread of disease, but leave States with considerable discretion regarding their implementation at the national level.",

Article 2 establishes the purpose and scope of the Regulations in the following terms: \"to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.\" Article 1 defines \"public health risk\" as \"a likelihood of an event that may affect adversely the health of human populations, with an emphasis on one which may spread internationally or may present a serious and direct danger.\" Article 3 sets out the principles of the Regulations, which include their implementation with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons and the recognition that States have the sovereign right to legislate and to implement legislation in pursuance of their health policies.",

There have been many such cases. Following an outbreak of cholera in Peru in 1991, even though the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control found that there was no basis for travel or trade restrictions, the European Community and other countries imposed import bans on fish and other perishable foods, inspection requirements and restrictions on travelers from Peru. In 1994, after India reported a suspected outbreak of plague in one city, even though the WHO had advised that no travel or trade restrictions were appropriate other countries canceled flights, closed borders to goods and people, and issued travel advisories (von Tigerstrom 2005) . Such responses explain the past reluctance of countries to report public health threats. While World Trade Organization (WTO) rules prohibit trade restrictions on food and plants that are not based on scientific evidence, when countries impose unjustified trade restrictions it may take a few years to resolve the matter through the dispute settlement system of the WTO, by which point the economic damage has already occurred. However, in the age of internet, email and mobile telephones, it has become difficult for countries to suppress information on outbreaks of disease.",

In particular, the creation of UNAIDS highlights the ineffectiveness of the WHO in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which already had a mandate to address global health issues. While there is a need for political leadership and advocacy to address HIV/AIDS, as well as a need to incorporate HIV/AIDS issues into the operations of various organs of the UN, the WHO could have been charged with these tasks. Indeed, the creation of UNAIDS, while it is a potentially useful coordinating mechanism, creates further risks of duplication and overlap between the activities of multilateral institutions with respect to HIV/AIDS, a problem discussed in Chap. 7. While the creation of UNAIDS serves to highlight the importance of HIV/AIDS, this precedent raises concerns about the ability of the UN system to effectively address similar global diseases that already exist or that are likely to emerge in the future. The creation of new UN agencies to address specific global diseases as they arise is a less desirable strategy than improving the effectiveness of existing institutions.",

            "text": "According to PEPFAR guidelines on preventing HIV transmission among injection drug users (IDUs), the most effective strategy for preventing HIV/AIDS is one that decreases drug use and includes information and education, community outreach, risk reduction counseling and substance abuse treatment. Funding may not be used to support needle exchange programs (US Department of State 2006). Needle exchange programs are politically controversial. A 1993 review of needle exchange programs, commissioned by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported that ten of fourteen acceptably executed studies found attendance at a needle exchange to be associated with reduced syringe sharing, and four found no such association (Kahn 1993) . Four studies that examined the impact of exchange programs on high-risk sexual behaviors were inconclusive (Gibson 1998). In a study that compared HIV prevention strategies in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, researchers concluded that a high level of HIV counseling and testing might be more effective than needle exchange programs alone in preventing HIV transmission among IDUs (Amundsen et al., 2003) . However, there is clear evidence that needle exchange programs have reduced HIV transmission rates among IDUs in areas where they have been established. Six US government-funded reports concluded that needle exchange reduces HIV transmission, four of which recommended revoking the federal funding ban on needle exchange programs (Gibson 1998) . A 1997 study of 81 cities worldwide found that HIV infection rates increased by 5.9% per year in the 52 cities without needle exchange programs and decreased by 5.8% per year in the 29 cities that did provide needle exchange programs (Hurley et al., 1997) . Another study of HIV among IDUs in New York found that HIV prevalence fell from 54 to 13% following the introduction of needle exchange programs (Jarlais et al., 2005) . A 2004 WHO report also found that needle exchange programs reduce HIV infection (World Health Organization 2004) . In reviewing this evidence, Magee concluded that the refusal to implement such programs for political or moralistic reasons undermines efforts to control the spread of HIV among IDUs (Magee 2007) . Indeed, US opposition to needle exchange programs has undermined not just the effectiveness of PEPFAR in HIV prevention and treatment. In 2006, the WHO Asia-Pacific conference withdrew a resolution calling for universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment because the United States insisted on amendments to remove expressions of support for items such as needle exchange programs (Associated Press 2006) .",

Organizations that actively promote hatred of gay people and disseminate inaccurate information about the reliability of condoms are barred from receiving PEPFAR funds. However, Pastor Martin Ssempa's Makerere Community Church received USD 40,000 in PEPFAR funding to provide an abstinence education program. The Pastor helped organize a rally demanding government action against gay people, calling homosexual conduct \"a criminal act against the laws of nature.\" The Makerere Community Church also disseminates information stating that condoms do not protect against HIV and has burnt condoms in public. Human Rights Watch has called on the US government to clarify its opposition to attacks on the rights of gay people in Uganda and to articulate that it does not support the use of PEPFAR funds to promote homophobia (Carter 2007) .",

Fillinger has noted three areas where this has occurred to the detriment of the efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries: (1) the Mexico City Policy, which prevents USAID funding for family planning from going to foreign NGOs that use funding from any source to provide counseling and referrals for abortions, advocate making abortion legal or more available in their country or perform abortions in cases not involving a threat to the woman's life, rape or incest; (2) the PEPFAR policy that promotes abstinence only programs, which do not prevent the transmission of HIV within marriages and fail to promote the use of condoms for HIV/AIDS prevention; and (3) the prohibition on requiring prior USAID experience, which allows faith-based organizations to be deemed competitive for US funding based on factors other than experience (Fillinger 2006) . The latter was In 2005, USAID issued a policy directive to: (1) permit recipients of funding to not use a multisectoral approach to HIV prevention and to not participate in prevention and treatment programs to which the recipient organization has a moral or religious objection; (2) to prohibit the use of funding to promote the practice or legalization of prostitution and sex trafficking; and (3) to require organizations that receive PEPFAR funding to sign a certification opposing prostitution and sex trafficking (USAID 2005) . This policy undermines HIV/AIDS prevention by further stigmatizing sex workers and discouraging programs that address them (Fillinger 2006) . Fillinger concluded that these ideological policies undermine best practices in HIV/AIDS programs and disproportionately hurt women, who are already disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS.",

This approach undermines coordination and local leadership (Mwale 2004) . Moreover, while PEPFAR has a good system for collecting data on the amounts, destination and use of its funds, much of this data (such as how much money is spent on treatment) is not made public and not shared with other stakeholders (or even US government staff that work on PEPFAR, at USAID and the CDC) (Bernstein and Hise 2007) .

First, the number 40,000 is estimated based on just 33 states, with several large states missing from the list. Thus, the number 40,000 is almost surely an underestimate. HIV/AIDS diagnoses were collected from 33 states with name-based reporting systems between 2000 and 2004. Over this 4-year period, 157,252 diagnoses were made in the 33 states. Thus, 33 states alone produced close to 40,000 new cases per year. Second, the national goal in the 2000 Strategic Plan of the CDC was to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the United States from an estimated 40,000 cases to 20,000 cases by 2005, with a particular focus on eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in new HIV infections. The 2000 Strategic Plan also proposed to decrease by at least 50% the number of persons in the United States at high risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection by delivering targeted, sustained and evidencebased HIV prevention interventions. The numbers are still above 40,000 per year (CDC HIV Prevention Strategic Plan 2007, Appendix) .

However, for many years, the CDC has used informal methods to estimate that about 40,000 people are newly infected with HIV annually in the United States. A more accurate method is expected to show that the new infections are in fact much higher, possibly by 50%. However, estimating new HIV infections in the United States is also a political issue, since it influences the funding and design of HIV prevention programs. The Bush administration has increased financing for AIDS treatment and prevention programs outside the United States (see the preceding section on PEPFAR), but funding for domestic prevention efforts decreased by 19% in inflation-adjusted terms from 2002 to (Harris 2007 .",

Moreover, even the creation of UNAIDS has been insufficient to provide adequate multilateral leadership on HIV/AIDS in the UN system. MSF has moved in to fill the gaps left by the UN system. However, while MSF has filled an important need, its withdrawal from collective efforts sets an unfortunate precedent in an environment where a multiplicity of players and approaches requires greater harmonization and coordination of efforts in order to ensure the efficient use of resources. Nevertheless, the creation of UNAIDS and the approach of MSF both serve to highlight the need for ongoing reforms to improve the effectiveness of global health institutions and have led to innovative approaches that may serve as models for such reforms.",

The obligation of countries to report disease outbreaks to the WHO, together with the economic incentives countries have to report outbreaks and to follow WHO recommendations, reveal a sophisticated approach to regulation design. The focus on reporting outbreaks of fast-moving diseases, rather than slow-moving diseases like HIV/AIDS, endemic diseases like malaria or contagious diseases like tuberculosis, suggests that there is a degree of specialization occurring among organizations that address global health concerns. It also suggests a lack of confidence in the ability of the WHO to move beyond its traditionally narrow focus on the medical aspects of fast-moving, infectious diseases. While the division of responsibilities avoids overlap and duplication of efforts, it will require closer coordination than might be necessary if the WHO were to serve a central leadership role with respect to the manner in which global diseases are addressed. However, despite the global nature of many modern diseases and epidemics, national governments are unlikely to be willing to relinquish control over their ability to protect the health of their citizens. This factor is likely to continue to limit the extent to which the WHO can expand its leadership role in global health issues.",

The WTO has not yet negotiated regulations regarding traderelated movement of people, but is likely to be the forum in which such rules will be negotiated on a global basis. It seems both unlikely and unnecessary to extend the mandate of the WHO any further to the regulation of the international movement of goods or intellectual property rights, since the WTO regulates these issues at the international level.",
