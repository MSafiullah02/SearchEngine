Calming the cytokine storm may be one key to save the life of patients with severe pneumonia. Here, inspired by the intrinsic affinity of platelets to the site of inflammation, we have engineered platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) for pneumonia-targeted drug delivery. It is demonstrated that PEVs that are easily generated from the activated platelets can selectively target pneumonia in the mice model with acute lung injury (ALI). By loading with [5-(p-Fluorophenyl)-2-ureido] thiophene-3-carboxamide (TPCA-1) that can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, the PEVs significantly improve therapeutic benefits by inhibiting the pulmonary inflammatory cells infiltration, and calming local cytokine storm compared with the free drug-treated group. Furthermore, we find that PEVs could serve as a broad platform that can selectively target various inflammatory sites, including chronic atherosclerotic plaque, rheumatoid 2 arthritis and wound associated with skin.",

            "text": "Inflammation as a defense mechanism in the body is an immune response as the basis of many physiological and pathological processes. [1] [2] However, certain infections can also cause an overwhelming local/systemic inflammatory response, leading to life-threatening diseases such as the pneumonia. 3 For example, 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) has infected more than 3,000,000 people and killed more than 200,000 of people in worldwide so far. 4 The mortality rate of severe patients is over 60%. 5 More and more evidences suggest that patients with severe pneumonia have cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), in which the body's immune response leads to an uncontrolled inflammation in the lung tissue. 6 As far as we know, inhibiting the cytokine storm may be one key to save the life of patients with severe pneumonia infected with highly pathogenic virus such as SARS-Cov-2. 7-10 Certain anti-inflammatory therapeutics have proven to be beneficial in the clinical treatment. [11] [12] [13] For example, Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blockade) and corticosteroids have been approved to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in China. Although promising, current systemic treatment options for inflammation therapy in clinical often lead to high/frequent dosing and side effects. For instance, osteonecrosis often happened in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients caused by corticosteroids usage. 14 Targeting the pneumonia to improve the efficacy, while reducing the dosage and side effects remains elusive in clinical treatment. Further efforts are demanded to develop targeting delivery systems for modulating and reducing the local inflammatory responses in pneumonia. [15] [16] [17] Cellular delivery systems have raised increasing attentions due to their excellent biocompatible and unique delivery behaviors. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Platelets are one kind of inherent cells in the body, which can serve as drug delivery systems are equipped with several advantages compared with other synthetic delivery systems. 19 For example, as a one role of immune cells, platelets have the intrinsic affinity to the site of inflammation. [23] [24] [25] They can bind to the activated/inflamed vascular walls through a range of receptor patterns, including CD40L, glycoproteins Ib\u03b1, \u03b1IIb and VI and P-selectin. [23] [24] [25] In light of this, we here leveraged platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) to facilitate the delivery of anti-inflammatory agents to pneumonia upon the intravenous administration (Figure 1a) .",

Preand post-activated platelets and PEVs were analyzed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1b-c) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 1d-f, Figure S2a ). The activated platelets exhibited around 100-200 nm as shown in DLS data compared with platelets without activation which indicated the PEVs generation after activation (Figure 2e ). PEVs were then isolated from the platelet-activated supernatant by ultracentrifugation according to a standard protocol. 32 The purified PEVs showed spherical shape with sizes of about 100-150 nm (Figure 1c) compared with the non-activated platelets (Figure 1b) . To ensure the obtained vehicle was derived from platelets, protein profiles of platelets and PEVs were examined by SDS-PAGE and western blot. As expected, PEVs partially contained proteins from original platelets (Figure 1g) . The existence of CD41 on PEVs further confirmed the PEVs were derived from platelets, while some cytosolic proteins such as actin was lost in PEVs compared with platelets (Figure 1h) . Besides, PEVs were stored in various buffers at 4 o C for at least 4 days in vitro ( Figure S2b ).

It was observed that the total percentage of CD45+ cells at the site of lung tissue was reduced remarkably of the mice receiving the TPCA-1-PEVs compared to the TPCA-1 alone (Figure 5d-f) . We next measured macrophages in the lung. CD11b lo F4/80 hi resident macrophages, which play crucial roles in acute lung injury (ALI).

TPCA-1, a potent and selective inhibitor of I\u03baB kinases (IKK) in NF-\u03baB pathway, can inhibit the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 from human monocytes 40-41(Figure 3a). It has been demonstrated that TPCA-1 can reduce the severity of pneumonia in mouse 42 . Here, we loaded the TPCA-1 into the platelets, likely due to the passive diffusion and/or hydrophobic interaction, followed by platelets activation to obtain the TPCA-1-PEVs. The characteristic absorption peak of TPCA-1 in the absorption spectrum indicated the successful loading of TPCA-1 into the PEVs(Figure 3b). The size and the zeta potential of the TPCA-1 loaded PEVs did not changed significantly compared to empty PEVs (Figure S3). The drug loading percentage was about 10.6% (loaded/added TPCA-1)(Figure 3c) and we obtained TPCA-1-PEVs containing 4.6 wt% of TPCA-1 at the concentration of TPCA-1 with 600 \u00b5g/mL. The PEVs exhibited a controlled, and sustained release profile, with approximately 85.3% of total TPCA-1 leaked out from the PEVs into the medium within 48 hours(Figure 3d).",

As the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during pneumonia the may contribute to lung injury, 2,7-Dichlorodi-hydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining of lung tissue for detecting ROS production has been performed. As shown in figure 4b, we found that TPCA-1-PEVs treatment could significantly inhibit the generation of ROS during the acute pneumonia, while free TPCA-1 treatment showed a limited ROS scavenging capability. In addition, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO), which are important defenses to neutralize ROS in the lung were found increased remarkably to validate removal of ROS(Figure 4d-e).44",

Mice platelets were separated according to the protocol reported previously.20 In brief, whole blood was collected from the sinus of BALB/c mice and resuspended in PBS containing EDTA (5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) and PGE1 (1 \u00b5M, MCE), then centrifuged at 100 g for 15 minutes to remove red blood cells. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 800 g for 20 minutes. Centrifuged sediment was stored at room temperature for further use after resuspending. For the preparation of PEVs, the platelet concentrate was activated by thrombin (2 U/mL, Solarbio) for 30 minutes, and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 minutes. The collected supernatant was further subjected to ultracentrifugation to concentrate the PEVs into granules at a rate of 100,000 rpm for two hours. The morphology of PEVs was detected by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Protein expression of platelet and PEVs was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. The particle size and changes over time were measured by the dynamic light scattering (DLS). To prepare TPCA-1-platelet, TPCA-1 (APExBIO) dissolved at 600 \u00b5g/mL in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was add at specified inputs directly to platelet suspened in PBS containing EDTA (5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) and PGE1 (1 \u00b5M, MCE) for 12 h. The loading and sustained release of TPCA-1 (APExBIO) on PEVs was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To test the loading capacity, the loading content were measured by HPLC, the TPCA-1-PEVs suspension was dried by lyophilization and weighed. The drug content of TPCA-1 in PEVs was calculated with the following equation: loaded drug/dried TPCA-1-PEVs (wt/wt). We obtained TPCA-1-PEVs containing 4.6 wt% of TPCA-1 at the concentration of TPCA-1 with 600 \u00b5g/mL. The DiD or TPCA-1 was dissolved in a small amount of DMSO then diluted with PBS for further use.Animals. BALB/c mice (female, 6-8 weeks old, 18-20 g each) were purchased from the experimental animal center of Soochow University. Mice were allowed to adapt to the laboratory for at least seven days in climatic conditions. Experimental group sizes were approved by the regulatory authorities for animal welfare after being defined to balance statistical power, feasibility,and ethical aspects. The experiments were conducted under the guidance of the Institutional Review Board of Soochow University, which complied with relevant ethical codes. Cell lines. RAW264.7 cells (mouse leukemia cells of monocyte macrophage ) and HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) were obtained from ATCC. The cells were cultured in DMEM solution containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were tested every three months to exclude the presence of mycoplasma. Animal model induction and treatment. The acute lung injury mouse model was established according to previous reports. 30 BALB/c mice were anesthetized, then fixed in the supine position and injected intratracheally with LPS (8 mg/kg) into the posterior pharyngeal wall. After four h, treated with TPCA-1 or TPCA-1-PEVs for once. Animals were euthanized 24 h after the last injection. MTT cytotoxicity assay. 1\u00d710 4 RAW264.7 cells/well were plated on a 96-well plate. After 12 h, it was replaced with a medium containing different concentrations of the drug. After 24 hours of incubation, MTT reagent was added then incubated for another 4 hours. After that, the supernatant was removed and the residue was dissolved by adding dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbance of the solution was recorded with a multi-wall plate reader at 570 nm. In vitro binding. To obtain activated macrophages, RAW264.7 was cultured with 100 ng/mL LPS for 24 h. For adhesion studies, activated cells were co-incubated with DiD-loaded platelets or PEVs for 24 h, and washed three times with phosphate buffer saline to remove the unbound particles. The cells were stained with DAPI after fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde. The results were obtained by the fluorescent microscope. For activated endothelial cell binding, HUVECs was pre-stimulated with 100 ng/mL LPS (Biosharp), and incubated with DiD-labeled platelet or PEVs about 24 h respectively. The unbounded particles were removed by washing with phosphate buffer saline three times. The binding behaviors were determined after staining with DAPI. Intracellular ROS detection. ROS production was detected by reactive oxygen species assay kit. To create an inflammatory environment, RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with 100 ng/mL LPS (Biosharp) for 1 hour. TPCA-1, or TPCA-1-PEVs were added in groups and treated for another 24 h. Cells were then cultured with 20 \u00b5M 2,7-Dichlorodi-hydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, sigma) for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0 C. Subsequently, the cells were washed 3 times with serum-free medium. The fluorescence signal intensity of DCFH-DA oxidatively transformed fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) was measured by flow cytometry, and the change of intracellular ROS level was measured using Flowjo software. Cytokine assay. For in vitro stimulation, RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with 100 ng/mL LPS (Biosharp) for 1 hour, TPCA-1, TPCA-1-PEVs were added in groups and treated for another 24 h. Cytokine production was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the cell supernatant provided by the manufacturer.Western blotting. The protein expression of the inflammatory factor in the cell was detected by western blotting according to the existing method. Briefly, cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer, added to the loading buffer in proportion to boil, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAG gel electrophoresis. Follow the wet transfer procedure to transfer the protein to the PVDF membrane.After the milk powder is blocked, incubate with anti-CD41 (1: 1000) and \u03b2-actin (1: 5000) antibodies, detection with the HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:5000).Fluochemr was used to display hybridization bands, and the software Image J was used for the quantitative analysis of western blot.In vivo targeting to inflammatory site. The model was generated as mentioned above. The mice were injected intravenously with DiD-loaded PEVs. Age matched normal mice were used as controls. At the predetermined time intervals, mouse and organ were imaged using IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (PerkinElmer Ltd.). For histological analysis, the organ was collected and embedded in OCT, and frozen sections were sectioned. Each section was 10 \u00b5m thick and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. After washing 3 times with phosphate buffer saline, 200 \u00b5L of serum was added to each section. Subsequently, CD68 primary antibody (Abcam) incubation was carried out, followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody incubation. Each part was stained with 200 \u00b5L of DAPI after washing three times with phosphate buffer saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The slides were sealed and analyzed by confocal microscopy.Histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. At the end of the experiments, the organ was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were cut into the slice with a thickness of 4 \u00b5m. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to assess inflammatory infiltration. The amount of CD45 was analysis by immunohistochemistry.Flow cytometry. Mice were euthanized and the dissected tissues were crushed by tissue grinding.The removed tissue was homogenized by nylon gauze to obtain a single cell suspension, and then treated with RBC lysis buffer and stained with fluorescent antibody (Biolegend) as indicated. The stained cells were analyzed on a BD Accuri\u2122 C6 flow cytometer, using the FlowJo software package.",

Our results highlighted that targeted drug delivery to treat pneumonia significantly reduced the cytokine storm syndromes compared with free drug therapy. Our formulation may inspire new treatments for COVID-19 patients.

Among them, platelets have the intrinsic affinity to the site of inflammation, based on which many platelet-or platelet membrane-mediated therapeutic carriers have been developed. In this work, platelet-derived extracellular vesicles are engineered with loading of anti-inflammation therapeutics (TPCA-1) for targeted toward pneumonia treatment. We find that the PEVs showed the excellent capacity of accumulating at the site of pneumonia. These TPCA-1 loaded PEVs significantly inhibited the infiltration of pulmonary inflammatory cells and calmed local cytokine storm syndromes compared to the free drug-treated group. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that PEVs could selectively target various inflammatory sites, broadening theragnostic applications of this delivery strategy. ",
