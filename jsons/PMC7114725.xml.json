            "text": "Degeneracy or redundancy of the genetic code ensures that multiple codons codify the same amino acid except for two amino acids i.e. methionine and tryptophan. The codons that encode the same amino acid are called synonymous codons. Numerous previous studies have shown that the usage of these synonymous codons in mRNA molecules in varying frequencies leads to a phenomenon known as codon usage bias (CUB) (Hasegawa et al., 1979). The evolution of CUB is very complex and a highly debatable subject. Various evolutionary processes explain the origin of synonymous codon usage variation or CUB, among them the two most accepted theories are the neutral theory and the selection-mutation drift balance model theory (Duret and Mouchiroud, 1999; Sharp et al., 1986, 1993; Shields and Sharp, 1987). However, the impact of these evolutionary forces in different species remains undetermined (Akashi, 1997; Hershberg and Petrov, 2008). In addition, various biological factors have been identified to be associated with CUB such as GC composition, gene expression level, gene length, protein structure, tRNA abundance and its types, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein (Bains, 1987; Bernardi and Bernardi, 1986; Gouy and Gautier, 1982; Ikemura, 1981; Tao and Dafu, 1998).",

            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV), an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, possesses high pathogenicity that causes fatal disease in both animals and humans (Wong et al., 2002). NiV is a single stranded RNA virus which belongs to genus Henipavirus, within the family Paramyxoviridae (Chua et al., 2000). Genome size varies from 18246 to 18252 nucleotides and the number of genes varies from 6 to 9 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). NiV was first identified during an outbreak of a disease that took place in Malaysia in 1998 (Lee et al., 1999). Outbreaks of NiV have occurred periodically since 2001 in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines (Arankalle et al., 2011; Ching et al., 2015; Hossain et al., 2008; Hsu et al., 2004). In the mid of 2018, Nipah outbreak was again reported in Southern parts of India. The natural hosts of the virus are fruit bats of Pteropodidae family (Olson et al., 2002). It is transmitted through contact with NiV infected animal causing a prominent risk for epidemic outbreak or through consumption of contaminated foods. Human-to-human transmission has also been observed (Clayton, 2017; Escaffre et al., 2013). In the outbreaks of Malaysia and Singapore, pigs were reported to be the intermediate hosts, whereas in Bangladesh it was the date palm sap contaminated by infected fruit bats (Chua et al., 2001; Clayton et al., 2016). Clinical features are highly variable and may range from asymptomatic infection through acute respiratory syndrome to fatal encephalitis in humans and respiratory diseases in swine (Harcourt et al., 2001).",

This suggests the existence of genetic variability in codon usage in NiV genomes. Further, neutrality plot revealed that natural selection might have played a prominent role than mutation pressure in shaping the CUB of genes during evolution of Nipah virus. Codon bias analysis could be harnessed in designing peptide vaccine against disease causing viruses based on the expression potential of surface proteins, for example by identifying efficient epitopes of surface proteins for boosting up cellular immunity.",
