            "text": "With the advance of sequencing techniques, the database of DNA, RNA and protein has been enlarged rapidly, promoting the development of bioinformatics effectively. It has been increasingly important to develop efficient ways to obtain the information hidden in the gene data. In the last few decades, several methods to classify the genes have been proposed. In 1983, Hamori and Ruskin proposed a visible 3-D curve with the name of H-curve to tell the relations between different DNAs [1]. As the first graphical representation, it motivates other researchers in the following years to develop more graphical representations of DNA sequences including 2D, 3D and even multidimensional representations [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Besides the graphical representations, researchers try to combine some techniques from other disciplines into the study of genes and have proposed novel methods. For example, the Discrete Fourier Transform, which is broadly applied in signal process, has been introduced into the process of genes [15], [16]. It is proved effective in the analysis of DNA sequences.",

            "text": "Methods for similarity analysis of proteins also have been proposed recently. Considering a protein sequence consists of 20 kinds of different amino acids while a DNA sequence only consists of four bases, it is much more complex to express a protein than a DNA sequence. However, there are some methods which are generalized from the ways of analyzing the DNA sequences [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Yau et al. propose a method with the name of protein map [22] following their previous work. They use the moment vectors to represent proteins and generate a universal protein map [23]. Motivated by the protein map, they also develop a novel method, with the name of protein space, to realize the nature of protein universe [24]. Their method is applied successfully in their following papers and proved effective [25], [26]. He et al. present a new way of generalized Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method to outline a dynamic 3D graphical representation [27] which is analogous to the original CGR method proposed by Jeffrey for graphical representation of DNA [3]. El-Lakkani and Mahran introduce a two dimensional graphical representation of protein sequences. They propose a new mathematical descriptor in their paper to measure the similarity of two protein sequences [28]. Li et al. present a graphical representation with the name of UC-Curve [29]. The amino acids are assigned to the circumference of a unit circle with a cyclic order. Geometric center vectors of UC-Curves and Euclidean distances are extracted to analyze pairwise similarities. Moreover, techniques from other disciplines have been applied in the analysis of proteins successfully. W\u0105\u017c and Bieli\u0144ska-W\u0105\u017c introduce the moments of inertia as new descriptors in the calculation of similarities [30], [31]. Based on their works, Czerniecka et al. propose a 20-D dynamic representation of protein sequences [32] and the scheme is proved reasonable.",

Based on the ranks, the value of \u03b8\ni will change from 0 to 2\u03c0 at the interval of 120\u03c0. For example, the radian 0 will be assigned to the amino acid I and 620\u03c0 will be assigned to the amino acid A.

Another radian \u03c6\ni, ranging from 0 to 2\u03c0 at the interval of 120\u03c0, will be assigned to amino acids according to the isoelectric point values.

The results in Fig. 6 are similar with ours. However, as illustrated in the phylogenetic tree, the viruses which belong to H2N2 are clustered in different branches. We conclude from the figures that the results obtained from different methods have an overall agreement even though there exists some variation between different methods. The phylogenetic trees in different figures reveal similar classification of influenza A virus. Among the three methods, our approach is more accurate in the test.",

The approach in this paper provides an intuitive solution to analyze the protein sequences. We establish a novel measure based on Discrete Fourier Transform and Dynamic Time Warping to analyze the similarity of protein sequences. Based on the values of hydropathy and isoelectric point, we assign different radians to the amino acids according to their ranks. A three dimensional representation is constructed to represent all the amino acids. With the help of DFT and DTW, we get the power spectra and scale the spectra to the same length. The distances between species are evaluated by constructing phylogenetic trees. We use different datasets including animals and viruses to test our method. Compared to the existing methods and softwares, the computational time of our algorithm is large. However, there still exists ways to improve our method. For example, in the DTW process, a proper filter or sampling method could be considered to pick some important information from results of the DFT instead of keeping all the values of spectra. Also, the DTW algorithm could be improved to reduce the running time of our method. In the test, we find the method in our paper provides accurate classification of different species. An improved DFT-DTW method will be our goal in the future works.",
