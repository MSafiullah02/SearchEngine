Frequently taken for granted, the advent of commercial jet aircraft transportation has been the single most important factor in facilitating the unparalleled growth in international trade in equids, semen, and embryos that has taken place over the past 50 years or so.5 Air travel has revolutionized the speed and ease with which horses can be shipped between or within countries and has largely replaced other means of transporting horses over considerable distances by land or by sea. In today's world, the horse can truly be considered no less an \u201cinternational jetsetter\u201d than its human counterpart.",

In the process, however, such changes have inevitably increased the risk of spread of various equine diseases. Before elaborating on specific factors involved in the international dissemination of equine diseases in detail, it is important to appreciate the transformation that the equine industry in many countries has undergone over the past 50 to 60 years. Since the 1960s, there has been an unprecedented upsurge in the growth of the horse industry in many countries, both for commercial and recreational purposes. Consideration of the increased prominence of the equine industry worldwide must acknowledge the resurgence of interest in the horse through leisure activities. The 2005 Economic Impact Study carried out in the United States identified recreation as the single largest equine-related activity, involving 3.9 million horses of an estimated national equid population of 9.2 million animals.6 The most significant factor in this development was the favorable economic climate enjoyed by these countries over this period. National economics flourished from changes in the global market structure under various multinational trade agreements.7 Among the industries to benefit has been the equine industry, with a resultant increase in the volume of international trade in equids and semen. The trend toward globalization of the equine industry received further impetus after establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 1995.8 The primary goal of the WTO is to promote freer economic exchange between member countries through reduction or elimination of protectionist barriers to trade.9 Regrettably, continued growth in the horse industry worldwide has slowed in the last several years as a consequence of the recession that has significantly impacted the national economies of many countries. Notwithstanding the current economic downturn, emergent equine industries are being developed in the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.",

Limited studies have been done in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Mexico, all of which underscore the important cultural and economic value of the horse in these countries.12 Australia and the United States have carried out comprehensive studies of their respective equine industries.6, 13, 14, 15 The American Horse Council Foundation commissioned an economic impact study of the horse industry in the United States in the mid-1990s6 and again 10 years later.14 Comparison of the findings of the two studies revealed that the U.S. equid population had increased considerably over the intervening period, from an estimated 6.9 million in the mid-1990s to 9.2 million in 2005. Both impact studies dramatically demonstrated the major contribution of the horse industry to the national economy. In the 2005 study, the combined contributions of the direct, indirect, and induced effects of the industry (in terms of Gross Domestic Product) were assessed at more than $102 billion.6 The industry provides considerable employment, estimated at 1.4 million full-time equivalent jobs annually. Until the widespread financial recession in the last few years, revenue from the sale of equids had risen steadily, grossing in excess of $2 billion at its peak.",

The number of highly prestigious and lucrative equine competitive events has proliferated around the world in the past 15 to 20 years.3 This is well illustrated by the increase in number of major equestrian events held under the aegis of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI); these events have nearly doubled over the past 8 years alone. Attracted by the considerable prize monies involved, owners are shipping their horses many thousands of miles, sometimes from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, or vice versa, to compete in international equestrian or racing events. Transporting horses over significant distances for competition purposes has inherent risks (e.g., traumatic injuries, shipping fever). Nonetheless, the number of prestigious international events will likely continue to increase, with escalation in the volume of movement of horses, despite the inherent health risks involved.",

The vast majority of \u201cshuttle stallions\u201d are shipped from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere. While many of them are Thoroughbreds, Standardbred stallions are also shuttled.

These neuropathogenic strains of the virus appear to have evolved as a result of a single-point mutation in the viral DNA polymerase gene.27 Such strains have been shown to cause higher clinical attack rates and greater case-fatality rates than virus strains lacking this mutation. Available evidence from outbreaks of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States indicates that the frequency of this disease is increasing in these countries. Because of the high percentage of horses that can become latent carriers of this infection, these neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1 will inevitably become more widely disseminated through the international movement of equids and there is evidence to indicate this is already occurring.",

It has been recognized for many years that the risk of disease transfer is not necessarily equivalent among different categories of horses. For several reasons, high-value performance horses can be considered a lower risk category. Because of the frequency with which they travel internationally, they are tested more often and monitored more closely for a range of the most important diseases. Additionally, their vaccination status for diseases of significance is likely to be current. The goal of this initiative is to establish a strategic framework for countries and regions to harmonize their approach to sanitary conditions for the international movement of performance horses. Objectives are to (1) maintain the high health status of performance horses and minimize the risk of transboundary disease transmission while removing unjustified health requirements; (2) ensure the welfare of the horses during transportation; and (3) educate government regulatory authorities, industry, and stakeholders on OIE standards and biosecurity requirements relating to the international movement of performance horses.",

            "text": "Yet, another example of an industry initiative is the concept of establishing an \u201cequine disease-free zone\u201d in countries wishing to host an internationally recognized performance event but are unable to do so because of the disease status of their resident equine population. The aims of developing such a facility are twofold: (1) to enable equine athletes from other countries to compete in an international event without the risk of being exposed to a disease or diseases endemic in the host country and (2) to protect the host country's equine population from a disease introduced by a competing country's horses. Proof of concept that this was achievable was the \u201cEquine Disease-Free Facility\u201d that was developed in Guangdong Province in PR China. It enabled the country to host the equine program of the 2010 Asian Games. The detailed advance planning, discussions, and negotiations that took place between the relevant international agencies and ruling bodies and the national and provincial animal health authorities in China were crucial to ensuring the success of this unique initiative. Under similar circumstances in the future, other countries may adopt the same approach if intent on hosting international performance events.",
