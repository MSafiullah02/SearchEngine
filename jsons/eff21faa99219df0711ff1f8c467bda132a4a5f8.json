            "text": "The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is often used as a proxy for the actual number of ground truth COVID-19 infected cases in both public discourse and policy making. However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another 'flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.",

Colleges, universities, and cinema halls were soon to follow and were shut down within a week. On Sunday March 22, the Prime Minister of India announced a countrywide \"Janta curfew\" for a day. Finally, on Tuesday, March 24, the Prime Minister announced a 21 day complete lockdown for the country, which has been extended till May 3rd now. It is interesting to note that there were just 6 confirmed cases and 1 death till March 15 across the state of Karnataka, to which Bengaluru belongs, when the mega-city of Bengaluru was shut down. In fact, till March 24 there were only 517 confirmed cases across India 1 , a number which may appear small compared to the large (\u2248 1.3 Billion) population of the country. Even the growth rate of the number of cases was not very high. Yet, the policy makers decided to engage a lockdown, perhaps even with popular public support.",

But how well does the daily positive test outcome trend reflect the unknown ground truth? Can policy makers use it reliably to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as lockdown, even when the number of daily tests is very low? Such questions become even more important in view of several media articles and expert opinions questioning if India is testing its residents enough [16, 17] . Given the large population of India, it is unlikely that we can scale the tests to the level of countries like Iceland, which has tested about 5% of its population. Thus, what one expects out of more testing is to get a better estimate of the ground truth trend to enable better preparedness and well-informed policy decision making. With this context in mind, we ask a basic question: How much testing is enough?",

It is this indicator of ground truth trend that RST reveals well. Our conclusions are based on agent-based simulation for a population of 100000 individuals or agents distributed across a realistic synthetic city, interacting based on a realistic mobility pattern. Specifically, we use publicly available census data to distribute the agents across the 198 (urban) wards in the city of Bengaluru. The agents have health states related to COVID-19 and another, generic, 'flu'-like disease condition with similar symptoms, which evolve independently. A susceptible agent (in COVID state S) can get infect when it meets a COVID-19 infected agent (in COVID state I). The agents can interact with other agents in their neighbourhood or agents that visit similar locations daily. We instantiate the mobility of agents across the city using mobility data obtained from traffic flows. This evolution model drives the unknown state, a part of which is observed by testing policies, stored in a separate module in our implementation. A testing policy determines which agents will be subjected to testing and applies a randomized test to the selected agent. The history of test results is stored and is made available to intervention policies, which are stored in yet another module. An intervention policy outputs a control action which modifies the state evolution dynamics. For instance, a lockdown intervention will disable the interaction between the agents. We assume that the borders of the city are closed and there is no interaction with the outside world.",

The former has a similar setup as ours, except that the simulation is event-driven and uses a more detailed simulation of agent interaction. However, only contact tracing is considered and an ideal situation where there is no other flu with similar symptoms is assumed. In a way, this framework assumes that one can directly access the ground truth. The article [5] presents a similar discussion as our results, but the approach appears to be more statistical and not based on explicit epidemic modeling/simulation. We remark that our proposed new testing algorithm uses ideas from multi-armed bandit problems; the paper [4] proposes an algorithm that uses similar ideas towards achieving a good test allocation strategy.",

Note that this model is a simplification of the dynamics used in [7] and combines the several stages such as hospitalization and death into a single state R. The origin of such models in epidemiology can be traced back to the pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick in 1920s, and they have been used for modeling COVID-19 dynamics in [8, 12, 18, 14] The collective states C(t) = {C i (t), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n}, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T , form a discrete-time Markov chain where C i (t) on day t changes to the state C i (t + 1) on day t + 1 according to a pre-specified probability transition matrix T depicted in Figure 1 . Specifically, each agent changes its state from E to Note that an agent makes a transition from S to E based on its interaction with other agents. When an agent in state I meets another agent in state S, the latter agent gets infected with a pre-specified probability p. To model the meeting of agents, we include two components: The first is a \"neighbourhood\" component where each agent meets a set of randomly chosen agents from the same neighbourhood. In addition, each agent meets a fixed set of agents from its neighbourhood, generated randomly at start and then fixed throughout the simulation. Note that, for an agent, its neighbourhood need not coincide with its locality and can include a set of close-by localities. In our simulation, we have defined a neighbourhood as a set of localities touching (geographically) a given locality.",

However, a person keeps on shifting from S to I Flu states indefinitely -this is because the \"Flu state\" is an proxy for the individual contracting any illness with similar symptoms as COVID-19. As we shall elaborate later, any testing policy that makes a pool of symptomatic patients will treat an agent with C i (t) = I and F i (t) = I identically (if all their other features such as locality match).",

An effective information campaign by the government can ensure that patients with symptoms matching those seen in COVID-19 come out for testing. Nonetheless, the exact percentage of symptomatic patients that come out can vary with localities, since each locality differs in income levels and availability of medical facilities. To model this, we incorporate \"under-reporting\" in our framework which can be represented by a locality wise reporting probability vector. Further, our tests sample randomly from the pool of symptomatic patients. In practice, this sampling is implemented by medical professionals who recommend a subset of symptomatic patients for testing. We believe that all the policies we have simulated can be (and, for some, have been) converted to an implementable form on the ground at least in the Indian context, e.g., the containment plan of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, already lays down \"hotspot detection' as part of a testing/intervention strategy [15] .",

Figure 5 depicts the mean daily test score (number of tests with positive results) evolution with time for 10 independent simulation runs, along with the corresponding 1-standard deviation ranges shaded in lighter colour, for a daily budget of 50 tests/day. The ground truth number of cases per day is also plotted in the background. It is interesting to note that (a) RST shows high variance in reporting compared to the more biased CT and LBT, (b) while all 3 tests are equally accurate in capturing the trend of the ground truth in the phase leading up to the peak of actual case count, their performance after the peak is reached is quite different -CT and LBT tend to fall earlier than RST 4 . Also interesting is the short-lived peak in the curve for LBT early on -this is due to the test aggressively prioritising testing from the affected seed locality. A smoothed version of the test results, plotted alongside, shows that smoothing can make the outputs of CT and LBT capture the rise-fall trend of the ground truth in a better fashion. Note that we have chosen a smoothing window of 8 days since the average time from COVID state 'I' to COVID state 'R' in our model is 8 days.

Roughly, 30,000 tests are done daily in India when this article is being written and roughly 1,500 of them happen in the state of Karnataka, the state to which the city of Bengaluru belongs. This amounts to 1 test for about 40,000 people. In fact, even at this low number of tests, positive tests reflect the ground truth trend in our experiments. We conducted experiments with uniform seeding with 5 tests per day (for 100K population) and a shorter experiment with RST alone with 50 tests per day for 1M population; the results are displayed in Figures 22  and 23 . We are tempted to conclude from these observations that India is doing enough daily tests to get a good idea of the ground truth trends. Even with these few tests, a mix of RST and CT, which seems to be the current testing policy for India and many other countries, is a good testing policy. In the initial phase of the spread, perhaps one can control the rapid spread by identifying a large fraction of the infected patients by increasing testing to scale up to the number of infected. But once a significant fraction of population is infected, it may become infeasible to quarantine all the patients. In such a situation, non pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown are the only option and the role of testing is to get a handle on the ground truth trend. Our simulations suggest that this can be done even with 1 test per 10000 people or so.",

Second, our policies rely on symptomatic patients coming out for testing (CT does not assume that). While this can be ensured by an active information campaign and ready access to doctors and digital medical advice, it is important to understand what can happen when a subsection of population is unable to report symptoms. Third, having more positive tests can perhaps offer robustness to deviations from our model in practice.",

We have not studied gradual ramping-up of test budget, nor have we studied more localized interventions (though our simulations suggest that LBT will be more effective to enable a local lockdown). The effect of under reporting needs to be studied more thoroughly, too. It is of interest also to study extensive testing in an emerging hot-spot as well as pooling for more efficient testing. We plan to consider these issues in later versions of this ongoing work.",
