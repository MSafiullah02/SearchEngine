These efforts have led to advances in basic science and many therapeutic breakthroughs including development of inhibitors targeting HIV and other viruses. In this review, we analyze all antiviral therapeutics on the market since the approval of zidovudine (Retrovir\u00ae) on the basis of clinical indication, molecular size (small versus large), mode of action (or molecular target), and use in combination with other therapeutic agents. We also report all antiviral therapeutics currently in clinical-stage evaluation with the goal of comparing current research with past approvals to predict potential trends and changes in antiviral medicine. This work also helps to understand the driving forces behind innovation and success in antiviral research.",

Monthly approval reports from January 1987 through December 2017 were scanned to create an exhaustive list of 179 antiviral medications approved in the United States over the 30-year period. To narrow the focus to novel therapeutic agents, generic drugs were excluded from the list by identifying agents with \u201ctentative approval.\u201d When a generic drug product is ready for approval before patents or exclusivity protections on the reference listed drug product expire, the FDA issues a tentative approval letter and delays final approval of the generic drug product until all patent or exclusivity issues are resolved. Tentative approval letters, therefore, provided a means for screening out generic equivalents from this evaluation. Next, drugs not considered explicitly antivirals, such as pharmacokinetic enhancers like cobicistat, were excluded resulting in a subset of 108 drugs. This list was condensed further by restricting it to drugs submitted as either Class 1 (new molecular entity [NME]) or Class 4 (new combination) to eliminate approvals related to formulation changes, such as extended-release versions of previously approved drugs (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/aboutfda/centersoffices/officeofmedicalproductsandtobacco/cder/manualofpoliciesprocedures/ucm470773.pdf). We define NME as a drug that contains an active moiety that has never been approved by the FDA or marketed in the US. When drugs such as Epivir\u00ae received approval for a novel indication, first for HIV and later for hepatitis B virus (HBV), each approval was included as a separate entry. The final list consisted of 88 unique antiviral drug approvals, which were cataloged using the following characteristics:\n",

The main purpose of combination therapies is to prevent or delay the emergence of drug resistance by inhibiting viral replication at multiple points in the viral life cycle. During the 1987\u20132017 period, antiviral monotherapy approvals totaled 64 and combination therapy approvals totaled 24 (Fig. 3B). Approval of the initial combination therapies against HIV-1 infection followed the approvals of the individual components as monotherapies, which helps explain their later emergence as combination drug therapy approvals (Fig. 3B). Lamivudine/zidovudine (Combivir\u00ae) was the first fixed-dose combination therapy approved for HIV-infected patients in 1997, soon after the approval of lamivudine in 1995 (Fig. 1). For HCV combination therapies, most NMEs were approved as part of a combination therapy without any prior individual drug approval. One notable exception is sofosbuvir (Sovaldi\u00ae), which was approved first in 2013 as a monotherapy against HCV and was approved soon after in combination therapies: Harvoni\u00ae in 2015, Epclusa\u00ae in 2016, and Vosevi\u00ae in 2017 (Fig. 1 and Table 1).",

            "text": "Over the last thirty years, only thirteen antiviral drug approvals (ten NMEs) target host mechanisms; most approved antivirals work as virus-targeting (or direct-acting) agents interacting with viral targets (Fig. 4\nA). Approved host-targeting molecules include interferons as immunomodulating agents (interferon alpha-2b, interferon alpha-n3, interferon alfacon-1, peginterferon Alfa-2B, and peginterferon Alfa-2A). Five host-targeting small molecules have been approved. Imiquimod (Aldara\u00ae) is a toll-like receptor (TLR)7 agonist approved in 1997 for the topical treatment of genital and perianal warts, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and actinic keratosis. Docosanol (Abreva\u00ae) was approved as a topical cream in 2000 to treat herpes labialis caused by HSV-1 infections. Although the mechanism of action of docosanol is not entirely understood, its very broad antiviral spectrum and interaction with plasma membranes suggests that it does not act directly on viral particles (Leung and Sacks, 2004). In 1998, ribavirin (Rebetol\u00ae), a guanosine analog, was approved for the treatment of HCV infection. Ribavirin is believed to have multiple mechanisms of action, including immunomodulation and inhibition of human inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) (Paeshuyse et al., 2011). In 2007, maraviroc (Selzentry\u00ae) was approved to treat HIV-1 infection by targeting C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), one of the main host chemokine receptors for virus entry into T-cells. Topical Sinecatechins (Veregen\u00ae) is a water extract of green tea leaves that was approved in 2006 for treatment of genital warts caused by the HPV, without a well-defined mechanism of action.",

            "text": "Viral enzymes (polymerase + protease + integrase) represent the main protein targets of antiviral agents. Inhibitors of viral enzymes account for more than two-thirds of all antivirals including virus- and host-targeting agents approved between 1987 and 2017 (Fig. 4B). With 27 approved NMEs, polymerase inhibitors represent the largest class of virus-targeting agents (Fig. 4B). Polymerase inhibitors fall into two categories: nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors. Although zidovudine (Retrovir\u00ae) was the first nucleoside analog approved for HIV-1 treatment, other nucleoside analogs used as virus-targeting antimetabolites such as acyclovir (Zovirax\u00ae) for HSV had already been approved. Nucleoside analogs are prodrugs that mimic natural nucleosides and are used, in their triphosphate forms, as substrates for the synthesis of viral nucleic acid. This means that nucleoside analogs must not only be substrates for viral polymerases, they also need to be recognized and phosphorylated by host nucleo(s/t)ide kinases. Long-term use of first-generation anti-HIV nucleoside analogs zalcitabine (Hivid\u00ae) and didanosine (Videx\u00ae) has been limited by acute toxicity due to insufficient selectivity between viral and human DNA polymerases (Johnson et al., 2001). Second-generation HIV-nucleosides such as lamivudine (Epivir\u00ae), emtricitabine (Emtriva\u00ae), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread\u00ae) displayed greater selectivity and tolerability. Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors typically bind to allosteric pockets distinct from the enzyme active site. In 1996, the anti-HIV compound nevirapine (Viramune\u00ae) became the first non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor to receive FDA approval. Since then, four more non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors have been approved for HIV-1 treatment: delavirdine mesylate (Rescriptor\u00ae), efavirenz (Sustiva\u00ae), etravirine (Intelence\u00ae) and rilpivirine hydrochloride (Edurant\u00ae) (Sluis-Cremer, 2014). Dasabuvir (Exviera\u00ae) is currently the only non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor approved for the treatment of HCV infection.",

Protease inhibitors block an essential maturation step in polyprotein processing that is common to many viruses and involve viral proteases. Ten HIV-1 protease inhibitors have been commercialized: saquinavir mesylate (Invirase\u00ae), indinavir sulfate (Crixivan\u00ae), ritonavir (Norvir\u00ae), nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept\u00ae), amprenavir (Agenerase\u00ae), fosamprenavir calcium (Lexiva\u00ae), lopinavir (Kaletra\u00ae), atazanavir (Reyataz\u00ae), tipranavir (Aptivus\u00ae), and darunavir (Prezista\u00ae) (Lv et al., 2015). The first HIV-1 protease inhibitor, saquinavir (Invirase\u00ae), resulting from peptidomimetic design, was approved in 1995. In combination with ritonavir boosting, more recently approved protease inhibitors such as atazanavir and darunavir aim to increase potency and bioavailability and reduce the potential side effects experienced with first-generation drugs of this class. Seven inhibitors targeting HCV protease have been approved and include boceprevir (Victrelis\u00ae), grazoprevir (Zepatier\u00ae), paritaprevir (Viekira Pak\u00ae), simeprevir (Olysio\u00ae), telaprevir (Incivek\u00ae), voxilaprevir (Vosevi\u00ae), and glecaprevir (Mavyret\u00ae) (Fig. 1). The first-generation inhibitors such as boceprevir and telaprevir, both approved in 2011, had to be prescribed alongside the pegylated interferons and ribavirin. More potent and better-tolerated protease inhibitors were later approved in combination with an all-oral interferon-free regimen, with those acting on all genotypes becoming best-in-class and most widely used (McCauley and Rudd, 2016).",

Similarly, small molecules continue to represent the major class of antiviral candidates, although a net increase in the number of biologics and oligonucleotide candidates has occurred relative to approved antiviral drugs. Finally, a large majority (\u223c91%) of antiviral clinical candidates are developed as monotherapeutic agents rather than combination therapies, which could be simply the result of the surge in new indications under evaluation (such as RSV, dengue, smallpox), new mechanisms of actions being exploited for intervention, and first-in-class molecules in development.

Current fusion inhibitors include JNJ-678, presatovir (GS-5806), AK0529, and RV521 (Table 2). Replication inhibitors represent the third class of RSV drug candidates.

ZMapp was tested in the clinic during the West Africa Ebola outbreak. Although ZMapp seemed to be beneficial, the results did not meet statistical significance for efficacy (Group et al., 2016). The new research and development efforts also resulted in the identification of GS-5734, a nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor with broad antiviral spectrum activity (Warren et al., 2016).

A striking example is the establishment of a robust cell culture surrogate system for HCV replication. Although HCV was first isolated and identified in 1989, attempts to grow the virus in cell culture were unsuccessful and greatly limited the ability to evaluate novel antiviral therapies. Ten years of research were needed to develop a subgenomic replicon system that captured the functionality of the non-structural proteins and recapitulated the intracellular steps of viral genomic replication (for review: (Kaul et al., 2009)). Because the HCV replicon was used extensively as a primary screen for antiviral testing, establishing this cell culture system was key to the discovery of all current HCV direct acting agents. This is particularly true in cases where biochemical or structural biology tools were not available to assist medicinal chemistry efforts. The discovery of daclatasvir, the first approved HCV NS5A inhibitor, resulted from a high-throughput screen using the HCV replicon assay (Belema and Meanwell, 2014).",

The flu inhibitor pimodivir was identified using a phenotypic screen under conditions of high multiplicity of infection (MOI) in which oseltamivir is not active. This targeted screen approach was key to differentiating novel PB2 inhibitors, largely MOI independent, from other classes of anti-flu agents that prevent virus replication only at the early stage of infection (Byrn et al., 2015). Fluorescence microscopy has also been used in conjunction with high-throughput screening to identify phenotypic changes associated with antiviral effects. Nucleozin, a preclinical first-in-class influenza inhibitor, was first characterized by its ability to block the nuclear accumulation of nucleoprotein in infected cells (Kao et al., 2010). Considering the growing use of high-content imaging for antiviral testing (Mudhasani et al., 2015; Watterson et al., 2016), it is likely that targeted phenotypic screens with early access to mechanism of action information will have an increasingly important role in antiviral drug discovery. These examples also show that, in many cases, the discovery of first-in-class antiviral drugs has its roots in biological innovations and ingenious use of novel in vitro assays.",

            "text": "The analysis of all antiviral drug approvals over the last 30 years reveals many examples of best-in-class programs that follow approved drugs or more advanced clinical candidates. As we detailed earlier in this review (e.g., polymerase and protease inhibitors), second- or third-generation HIV and HCV small molecule therapeutics have led to best-in-class drug approvals, providing the foundations for current standards of care. In these cases, research programs tend to leverage the biological advances made with first-in-class prototype molecules, and focus on chemical innovation through follow-on or back-up approaches (Schulze and Ringel, 2013). Different strategies have been used to foster best-in-class innovation for small molecules, sometimes relying on competitive intelligence (i.e., \u201cpatent busting\u201d). In all cases, best-in-class \u201cfast-follower\u201d antiviral programs result from intensified medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at addressing the shortcomings of the first-generation drugs: intrinsic binding or inhibition potency, strain/genotype/resistance mutation potency coverage, safety, or convenience. For example, the anti-HCV drug sofosbuvir is a monophosphate nucleoside prodrug as a follow-on to the first-generation molecule mericitabine. Sofosbuvir was designed to improve metabolic activation leading to the higher liver triphosphate formation by evading the first and limiting kinase phosphorylation step (Murakami et al., 2008). Similarly, the HIV-1 drug etravirine was designed to overcome suboptimal potency and drug resistance mutations associated with first-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Das et al., 2004). In the latter case, X-ray crystallography of the reverse transcriptase target provided valuable information for a structure-based drug design approach. Fragment screening and expansion campaigns have also contributed to the discovery of novel chemical starting points aimed at identifying next-generation antivirals. For example, crystallographic fragment screening of HIV integrase binders recently led to the discovery of novel allosteric inhibitors for the protein target (Patel et al., 2016). More generally, structural biology has proven to be a valuable tool in antiviral research to optimize ligand efficiency and therefore improve potency of inhibitors interacting with well-defined molecular targets.",

This is particularly problematic for first-in-class drug candidates targeting novel and therefore clinically unproven targets or pathways. This enormous obstacle to antiviral development has been partly addressed with the introduction of human challenge studies, now commonly used in early RSV and influenza clinical programs to obtain first proof-of-concept efficacy in healthy volunteers and to help design subsequent clinical trials in naturally infected patients (Bagga et al., 2013). Healthy adult volunteers are typically infected with low quantities of virus inoculum under controlled conditions resulting in mild symptoms. Human challenge studies were critical to the clinical development of first-in-class RSV fusion and polymerase inhibitors presatovir and lumicitabine, respectively (DeVincenzo et al., 2014; DeVincenzo et al., 2015).",

Single-tablet regimens using combination therapies represent another major clinical innovation aiming to increase efficacy and adherence to long-term HIV-1 treatment regimens. In comparison with therapies requiring two or more pills per day, once-daily single-tablet regimens were associated with greater adherence, fewer hospitalizations, and lower overall health care costs (Cohen et al., 2013).

Only a few drugs were approved to treat acute infections, mainly influenza. A large majority of the approvals were for small molecules and virus-targeting agents over large molecules and host-targeting therapies. The high rate of combination therapy approvals during the last five years is attributed to the rich HIV-1 and HCV drug pipelines that are now reaching maturation with multiple therapeutic options and competing best-in-class molecules. In contrast, 91% of molecules currently in clinical development are under evaluation as monotherapies because they are first-in-class experimental therapies for indications lacking other therapeutic options (Fig. 5B). The current experimental antiviral clinical pipeline also reflects, at least partially, a departure from classical targets (polymerase, protease\u2026) with oligonucleotide-based therapeutics, cell fusion inhibitors, capsid-assembly modulators, and an array of novel host-based mechanisms. In addition, we observe a surge in anti-HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies reaching clinical stage evaluation.",
