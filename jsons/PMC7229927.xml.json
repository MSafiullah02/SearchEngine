            "text": "COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by infection with the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has presented immense challenges globally to society, healthcare systems and to emergency departments (EDs). Specifically, to emergency providers, the possibility of infection poses a significant risk, raising concerns as to the use of stethoscopes in diagnosis. Additionally, traditional Chest X-Ray and Chest Computed Tomography (CT) pose the challenges of device and equipment contamination and nosocomial spread of the virus to uninfected patients in the ED and hospital. The COVID-19 pandemic has further demonstrated the opportunity for the use of point of care ultrasound (US) as a rapid, portable modality for clinical diagnosis and decision making. In addition to well-known diagnostic utility in evaluating the lungs1, US technology also has advantages of being easier to clean and keeping the potentially infective patient in isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission and limiting exposure to multiple health care workers3.",

He denied shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain. The patient appeared comfortable, febrile to 39.1\u00b0, but with BP, HR and RR within the normal range, and reassuring oxygen saturations of 96% both resting and with exertion. Lung exam was normal, abdominal exam was benign, and the rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. He was discharged with close follow-up and return precautions, including follow-up phone calls, and returned to the ED two days later. This time, he was notably tachypneic, complaining of cough and shortness of breath, and hypoxic to 90% resting and 87% with exertion. He was admitted to a step-down unit, tested positive for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal PCR.",

Bedside ultrasound was completed using a linear probe to evaluate the thoracic cavity in two orthogonal planes bilaterally in the anterior, posterior and axillary spaces. Sub-centimeter consolidations were noted in the left posterior lungs. Focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia and atelectasis were noted in the posterior L lungs (Figures 2 and 3). Increased frequency of B-lines consistent with a viral process were also noted on the left side. Interestingly, although chest x-ray when the patient initially presented was unremarkable, when the patient returned two days later, bilateral multifocal pneumonia was noted on the repeat x-ray (Figure 1\n).",
