The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either therapeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagerybased tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase. Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology. When applied to radiological time-series, promising results are obtained with an accuracy rates higher than 92%.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a variety of diseases in humans, ranging from colds to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). In recent months, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that a new coronavirus called COVID-19 has spread aggressively to several countries around the world [1] . COVID-19 can cause respiratory tract disease, fever and cough, and severe pneumonia in some extreme cases [2] . Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation mainly in the air sacs of the lungs responsible for oxygen exchanges [3] . The COVID-19 pandemic can be considered serious due to its high contagion and severity [4] . The impact on healthcare systems is also high due to the number of people requiring intensive care units (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilators for long periods [5] . Making evidence of COVID-19 infection is generally associated with specific lung pathologies. The most reliable way is to perform PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) [6] tests to asses the presence of Covid-19 RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) in the hosting individual. Because of low testing capacity especially at the very beginning of the pandemic spread, most countries performed tests generally to persons suffering from unclear and advanced symptoms, or individuals who evidently have been in contact with infected ones. In this sense, chest X-ray imaging is a technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Radiological tests may be performed by analyzing chest Xray images and identifying lung tissues potentially hosting infections. However, X-ray data analysis requires an expert in radiology, and may be time-consuming. Therefore, developing an automated analysis system may solve this problem and help saving precious time for radiologists. In this context, solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) can provide an accurate and inexpensive diagnosis for COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia [7, 8] . Furthermore, it is important to assess the pathology evolution for infected people, especially those suffering from severe lung pathology who may need intensive care. This is mainly essential since no specific treatment is known up to date, which means that a treatment line adaptation may be recommended if no improvement is observed. Pathology prognosis is also useful for prioritization of patients to take in charge in case of limited numbers of ICUs. In this paper, we propose a method for pathology prognosis based on analysing time series of chest X-ray images. The proposed method is based on both recurrent and convolutional neural networks, and allows to classify patients into two severity classes: positive or negative evolution. The main originality lies in the use of such a combination for COVID-19 prognosis. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. After an introduction covering the context of this research and the problem to be handled, Section II is devoted to a state of the art linked to our research. In Section III , an overview of the proposed approach is presented and all the steps are detailed for the multi-temporal classification of X-ray images. An experimental validation is illustrated in Section IV . Finally, conclusions and future work are drawn in Section V .",

            "text": "On the other hand, analysing time series generally presents the drawback related to the lack of annotated data sets. Annotations for time T n generally have to account for times T i with i < n. Having comparable data (same quality, size,...) is therefore an additional problem that leads to a difficulty in designing specific algorithms. In this sense, several applications have addressed this problem especially in clustering [9] , change classification [10] , change detection [11, 12] , and forecasting [13] . In medical imaging, time series are often used for functional [14] [15] [16] and spectroscopic [17] imaging, as well as motion analysis [18] . In this sense, X-ray images, and specifically CT (Computerized Tomography) is widely used due to its high spatial and temporal resolutions. As regards lung diagnosis, X-ray images are usually used to track pneumonia or other specific diseases. To analyse 3D + t (3D+time) data, one usually need to design sophisticated algorithms that are automatic, user-friendly, fast and accurate. Today, Deep Learning (DL) has demonstrated its efficiency as stated hereabove in many fields of image analysis. Specifically, CNNs [19] are among the mostly used networks. The specificity of CNN lies in its capacity to automatically learn implicit features from images, in contrast to classical machine learning methods where the designer has to specify the features to be extracted and how to calculate them. Since 2012, several models of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) [20] have been proposed such as AlexNet [21] , VGG [22] , GoogleNet [23] , Residual Net [24] , DenseNet [25] and CapsuleNet [26] . As regards data related to Covid-19, very recent works have already started to design diagnosis aid tools based on DL in order to detect Covid-19 specificities in chest X-ray images. All the approaches used deep learning for image classification as Covid or non-Covid. In [27] , a modified version of the ResNet-50 network has been proposed, on which a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is used to identify and automatically extract lesions from CT images. Using this module, the model can detect and classify CT images into three classes: healthy, COVID-19, and bacterial pneumonia. Likewise, chest radiographic images (CXR) have been used in [28] . The authors use a CNN based on various ImageNet 1 pre-trained models to extract the high-level features. Those features were fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a machine learning classifier, in order to classify the radiographic images affected by the corona effect coming. In [29] , the authors use a COVID-Net architecture with transfer learning to classify CXR images into four classes: normal bacterial infection, infection non-COVID, and COVID-19 virus. Another study [30] adopts a DeTraC deep CNN architecture [31] where the general idea is to add a class decomposition layer to the preformed models. The class decomposition layer aims to partition each class of the image dataset into several sub-classes. New labels are then assigned to the new set, where each subset is considered as an independent class, then these subsets are assembled to produce the final predictions. Despite the efficiency and the performances obtained by 1 http://www.image-net.org/ the various techniques described above for the detection of COVID-19, these approaches do not account for temporal correlations and only provide a decision about a single image. Prognosis remains therefore an open issue. Indeed, once a patient is declared infected, especially for those taken in charge in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of the lung pathology. This monitoring can be done by checking blood oxygen level or other metrics. However, an accurate prognosis has mainly to be done by controlling lung images. In this paper, we propose a method to analyse time series of lung images related to infected patients in order to derive a prognosis whether the pathological state is getting better or not. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a family of deep learning methods designed to manage temporal correlations between images in time series. These networks have recurrent connections in the sense that they keep information in memory: they can take into account at time T n a number of past states T i where i < n. These networks have been used in remote sensing to assess change detection in multi-spectral and hyper-spectral images [32] . RNNs are able to memorize information for a limited time and start to \"forget\" after a certain number of iterations, which makes training for many applications complicated. The algorithms used for updating the weight in RNNs are mainly based on the gradient with some well known practical problems such as gradient explosion. To overcome this limitation, Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been proposed in [33] [34] [35] as a particular type of RNN. These models explicitly capture recursive temporal correlations and they have already proven their effectiveness in various fields, such as speech recognition [36] , natural language processing [37] and image completion [38] . LSTMs have recently been used in medical imaging such in [39] where the authors propose a method with multi-modality and adjacency constraints for the segmentation of the cerebral image. Finally, it is worth noting that LSTMs and CNNs have already been combined in a number of works like [40] [41] [42] III. METHODOLOGY",

In deep networks, low, medium, and high functionality and classifiers are extracted into a set of layers. ResNet mainly solves two key problems generally faced in the training deep neural networks: vanishing and exploding gradients. The core idea of ResNet is to introduce the \"identity shortcut connection\" which skips one or more layers. Fig. 2 [left] illustrates plain layers where each convolution is connected to each other, which is the idea of all architectures before the appearance of ResNet, while Fig. 2 [right] shows the residual network (Skip connection). Skipping layers allows avoiding gradient to vanish during back-propagation. Using such connections, one can train extremely deep networks that can take advantage of the power of depth, and hence allow capturing complex patterns in data.",

LSTMs have sophisticated dynamics that allow it to easily \"memorize\" information for an extended number of time-steps.

However, the proposed ProgNet architecture slightly outperforms the others with the highest TP and TN rates, while the FN and FP rates are also the lowest. By enjoying the lowest FN, the proposed architecture appears very interesting since for such a prognosis, it is crucial to not miss negative evolution cases.",

In this sens, Fig. 8 shows two examples of time-series corresponding to two patient with a survival and death issues. These patient are well classified by the proposed ProgNet architecture, while the competing methods mis-classify them. When visually inspecting the images for the death issue, ambiguity comes from extended white areas in all the images with no visible improvement over time. The same remark holds for the survival case where white areas persist over time. To investigate why the proposed ProgNet architecture fails to classify some cases, Fig. 9 shows images of a time-series linked to a patient mis-classified by ProgNet. Indeed, we notice in some cases an unexpected change in the situation of a patient during the last image of the sequence. This can lead to some problems in learning all features and managing the time correlation between them. Analysing longer sequences can certainly improve the model performance.",

The proposed architecture analyses both spatial and temporal dependencies in input time-series of chest X-ray images. Our method is segmentation-free, which makes it competitive with respect to other assessment methods relying on time-consuming lung segmentation algorithms. When applied on radiographic data, the proposed ProgNet architecture showed promising results with good classification performances, especially for ambiguous cases. Specifically, the reported low false positive rates are interesting for an accurate and personalised care workflow. Future work will focus on applying the proposed architecture to CT data with longer time-series. However, data availability and homogeneity is a key issue. In this sense, the proposed architecture has to be adapted in order to handle data heterogeneity in time (time-series with different sizes).",
