This is particularly relevant in patients with ACS as many co-interventions known to affect mortality in ACS and stroke can cause bleeding and worsen anemia. Given the absence of monitoring of cointervention, and the fact that outcome assessors were only blinded in one ACS study (Carson 2013), we chose to rate down for risk of bias.

Though the two studies with the primary objective of evaluating transfusion thresholds in patients with acute coronary syndromes were not specifically ICU studies, the effects of transfusion upon ICU patients with acute coronary syndromes are likely similar. This judgement is further supported as the effects seen in these studies are consistent with post-hoc analyses of patients with vascular disease included in ICU transfusion trials. c. 95% confidence interval does not exclude significant harm or benefit, with absolute risk numbers of likely importance to patients. d. Outcome assessors were blinded in the single study (Carson 2013). e. Unclear how stroke was diagnosed (eg. imaging, clinical exam) or if it included minor events such as TIAs. Though the single study (Carson 2013) was not conducted in ICU patients with ACS, it is likely that the effects would be similar in ICU patients. f. Unclear how infections were defined (pneumonia, blood stream infection) or their severity and impact upon patients. Though the single study (Carson 2013) was not conducted in ICU patients with ACS, it is likely that the effects would be similar in ICU patients. g.

One study (Naidech 2010) reported \"pulmonary edema or respiratory distress\" though this data contributed only ~11% of the weight in the analysis and did not have a major impact upon the pooled estimate. e. Though there is moderate statistical heterogeneity, this is probably explained by quality of outcome measurement: Robertson 2014 had an ARDS outcome adjudication committee; Naidech 2010 reported a composite of \"pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.\" Inclusion or exclusion of the latter study has minimal impact upon the pooled estimate. f. Both studies included a composite of infections of varying severity and likely of varying importance to patients. Explanations a. Most data is from single centre studies which tend to have exaggerated effects b. Even though high value of I^2 statistic, point estimates and 95% CI of the largest studies are on the same side of the line of no effect, so this heterogeneity is of questionable importance. c. Though statistically significant, the optimal information size not met; more events needed to demonstrate effects are not due to chance alone. d. Though standardized definitions of myocardial infarction and stroke were used (eg. elevated troponin, change in EKG, loss of viable myocardium on imaging), the lack of blinding of clinicians could have led to significant detection bias. e. 95% confidence interval does not exclude significant harm or benefit, with absolute risk numbers likely to be of considerable importance to patients. f. Extremely small number of ARDS cases in these studies (2), resulting in very significant imprecision. g.

The studies included in this guideline generally excluded bleeding patients, and our guideline recommendations should not apply in these patients, if indeed hypotension and tachycardia are interpreted as signs of active bleeding (as opposed to ongoing sepsis, pain, agitation, etc.) Similarly, if a patient demonstrates signs of active cardiac ischemia, including changes on EKG, elevated troponin, new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram, then a restrictive hemoglobin-based strategy as is suggested in most of our recommendations may no longer apply. In such circumstances that active myocardial ischema, the recommendation for acute coronary syndromes (conditional recommendation for liberal transfusion threshold) should instead be followed.",

The majority of studies are experimental and do not report clinical outcomes. By comparison, there are many studies evaluating various hemoglobin triggers and resulting in more certainty about the impact of transfusion using Hb based thresholds compared to alternative transfusion strategies such as those described below. In the absence of evidence, the use of physiologic transfusion triggers may result in improved or worsened clinical outcomes compared to Hb based transfusion triggers, or increased or decreased use of blood products. In the absence of any evidence, we recommend the use of physiologic transfusion triggers in research settings only. ii) Muthuchellappan 2017 -prospective observational study of 13 adult neuro-ICU patients before, at the end, and 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours post-transfusion using rSO2 senses, and SCVO2 -rSO2 increased following RBC transfusion on both sides of the brain up to 24 hours -decrease in cerebral fractionation oxygen extraction up to 24 hours post (35+/-9% to 28+/-6%, p=0.021) -similarly changes see in CFOE for both injured and uninjured hemispheres of the brain iii) Rogers 2017 -randomized controlled trial at 3 centres, 204 patients randomized 1:1 to 'generic' or 'patientspecific' algorithm for tissue oxygenation during cardiac surgery -\"generic\" algorithm used globes measures of O2 utilization and intraoperative hematocrit transfusion threshold of 23% -\" patient-specific\" algorithm used regional O2 saturation using INVO5000, combined with restrictive transfusion HCT of 18%; goal was to maintain INVOS values of >50% or at >70% baselines value; if this could not bobtailed by modifying pump flow, gas exchange, or depth of anaesthesia, RCTS could be transfused above HCT 18% -primary outcome was cognitive function between 4-7 days post-op and at 3 months -no difference between groups in there core cognitive domains; only difference was verbal fluency scores were slightly higher in NIRS group; RBC transfusion, biomarkers of brain, kidney, myocardial injury, and costs were similar iii) Loukas 2011 -retrospective chart review of 100 patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CABG or valve); 50 using standard hemodynamic monitors and standard transfusion criteria; 50 using InSpectra tissue oxygen monitor intra-and post-operatively -transfusion rates were lower in the tissue monitoring group (30% conventional, 18% tissue) without a difference in other outcomes or length of stay iv) Powell 2012 -observational study of trauma and elective surgery patients admitted to ICU who received transfusion -13 patients, perfused capillary density did not change from baseline to 1 hour, but did change at 3 hours, MAP was unchanged v) Parimi 2018 -single centre retrospective study of 111 adult trauma patients who received minor transfusion (2 or fewer units) during first hour of admission; patients were divided into two groups, one with \"indication for transfusion\" and another with \"possibly unnecessary\" transfusion -lactate levers were different in the indicated vs unnecessary group (6.7 vs. 4.7 p=0.006), as were bicarbonate (20.9 vs. 22.6), but hemoglobin levels were similar (note: levels in the abstract are reversed!) -optimal cutoff value for predicting appropriate transfusion was lactate of 2.9 mg/dL (AUC 0.66) and bicarbonate 22 mmol/L (AUC 0.61) ",

We also aimed to provide a detailed description of the clinical use of PLT transfusions in general ICUs. \u2022 Methodology: multicentre observational cohort study conducted in all patients admitted to the UK general ICUs over 8 weeks. Daily data was collected on frequency if thrombocytopenia and plt transfusion and clinical outcomes such as bleeding and mortality. \u2022 Data collection:o Data were collected prospectively from patient records for the 24 hours before admission and every subsequent day in the ICU until discharge, death, or 30 days (for patients remaining in the ICU at this time). Data collected included hematology and coagulation test results, all procedures, the occurrence of clinically significant hemorrhage during each 24-hour period (defined either as estimated total cumulative blood loss >300 mL, 1 unit of red blood cells [RBCs], or bleeding from a critical site such as intracranial, using a previously described definition), and all blood component transfusions including PLT transfusions.\u2022 Results: o 1923pts from 29 ICUs included. Period prevalence of severe thrombocytopenia (<50) for the entire ICU stay was 12.4% (234/1881) and 13.7% (263/19140) When the first 24 hrs were included. o 35.4% of patients who had severe thrombocytopenia died in ICU. o 169 patients/1914 received plt transfusion (medium number of units per admission was 2, IQR 1-3). o Patients who received plt transfusion, 40% of pts had a plt account of >50 with no clinical sign of bleeding.Question: Platelets compared to no platelets in critically ill patients prior to invasive procedures CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk ratio Explanations a.

We also aimed to provide a detailed description of the clinical use of PLT transfusions in general ICUs. \u2022 Methodology: multicentre observational cohort study conducted in all patients admitted to the UK general ICUs over 8 weeks. Daily data was collected on frequency if thrombocytopenia and plt transfusion and clinical outcomes such as bleeding and mortality. \u2022 Data collection:o Data were collected prospectively from patient records for the 24 hours before admission and every subsequent day in the ICU until discharge, death, or 30 days (for patients remaining in the ICU at this time). Data collected included hematology and coagulation test results, all procedures, the occurrence of clinically significant hemorrhage during each 24-hour period (defined either as estimated total cumulative blood loss >300 mL, 1 unit of red blood cells [RBCs] , or bleeding from a critical site such as intracranial, using a previously described definition), and all blood component transfusions including PLT transfusions. \u2022 Notes: Emailed Authors for further data of patients who received plt transfusion versus those who did not. Some inconsistency in the numbers. Authors did respond and did not have the data we were looking for.",

Thrombocytopenia was defined as any PLT count less than 150 \u00c5~ 109 per/L, and severe thrombocytopenia was defined as a PLTcount less than 50 \u00c5~ 109 per L. Patients were identified from a prior prospective study that enrolled consecutive adult ICU patients with an expected length of stay of at least 72 hours and which excluded patients with an admission diagnosis of trauma, orthopedic or cardiac surgery, pregnancy, and life-support withdrawal. \u2022 Minor bleeding was defined as hemorrhage requiring the transfusion of fewer than 2 units of RBCs in 24 hours, bruising, oozing, or petechiae. \u2022 Major bleeding was defined as CNS hemorrhage, gross hematuria, hemoptysis, melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, vaginal bleeding, any gross blood loss requiring the transfusion of 2 or more units of RBS in a 24 hour period, bleeding requiring surgery or endoscopy or fatal bleeding. \u2022 Bleeding severity was done in duplicate.\u2022 Each transfusion a patient received was defined as therapeutic (to treat bleeding) or prophylaxic (to prevent spontaneous bleeding or bleeding anticipated from an invasive procedure). Indications for transfusion were adjudicated in duplicate. \u2022 Results: total 118 patients had thrombocytopenia, 37 patients had major bleeding, 24 had minor bleeding. 43.2% of patients with major bleeding received transfusion of plts, 11/77 of patients without major bleeding. 76 transfusions administered to 27/118 patients, 52 where prophylactic, and administered at a medial plt transfusion of 41 (IQR 20-57) and 24 (31.6%) were therapeutic with a median plt trigger of 51. Prophylactic transfusion for procedure related bleeding accounted for 18 transfusions given and administered at a median plt count of 46.",

For patients with multiple ICU admissions during the study period, only the first admission with a platelet count measurement was included \u2022 Exclusion Criteria: Patients were excluded for lack of research authorization and prior inclusion in the study such that no patient was included twice. Patients receiving red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in the 24 hours before measurement of the qualifying platelet count were also excluded to minimize the risk of including those with active bleeding. Similarly, patients receiving RBC transfusion in the interval between platelet count measurement and platelet transfusion were also excluded.\u2022 Outcomes: The primary outcome for this investigation was RBC transfusion within 24 hours of the qualifying platelet count value for nonplatelet-transfused patients and within 24 hours of platelet transfusion for platelet-transfused patients. Secondary outcome measures included ICU and hospital-free days (defined as 28 minus the ICU or hospital length of stay in days, with patients dying before discharge and those with ICU or hospital durations greater than 28 days receiving a score of zero), ICU mortality, all-cause mortality within 30 days of ICU discharge, and changes in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score 24 hours after the qualifying platelet count or platelet transfusion for non transfused and transfused patients, respectively.

Both studies stopped early, however this was due to difficulty with enrolment and low event rates, as opposed to stopping early for benefit or harm which can bias results. b. Indirectness of intervention: one study (Veelo 2012) contributing >40% of weight in the meta-analysis used correction with both FFP and platelets vs. no correction; unclear how much of the effects seen are due to plasma alone. c. Wide 95% confidence intervals which do not exclude benefit or harm of probable importance to patients. We are uncertain about the effect of plasma on major bleeding, due to indirectness of the intervention, and very few events leading to very significant imprecision. *The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI). CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk ratio GRADE Working Group grades of evidence High certainty: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect Moderate certainty: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low certainty: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect Very low certainty: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect",
