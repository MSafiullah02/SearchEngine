Patients generally exhibit a fever of over 100.4 \u00b0F, a dry cough, diarrhea, vomiting, and eventually pneumonia (Fan et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2004). From the first known case in November 2002 to its containment in summer 2003, mounting infections and deaths from this unfamiliar disease caused fear and economic disruption as the virus spread from Guangdong, China, to Hong Kong, Vietnam, and other countries including Canada. By the end of its course, over 8000 probable cases were identified worldwide and approximately 900 people had died (CDC, 2003). Fear of contagion spread far beyond infected areas, likely bolstered by the uncertainty of how the virus spread and its non-specific presentation.",

Narratives can be recontextualized to fit other temporal and social settings, becoming \u201cauthoritative\u201d representations of truth in the process (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003). A historical political-economic perspective that considers both the local and global is therefore crucial for understanding the production of risk and blame.",

Individuals and groups may project the risk of infection and death onto an \u201cOther\u201d in order to reduce the powerlessness experienced during a deadly epidemic (Crawford, 1994; Joffe, 1999). In this process of othering, disease origins and risk of infection are explained through moralizing metaphors of cultural superiority so as to locate risk and responsibility among marginalized populations. Such discourses often define community membership vis-\u00e0-vis one's relationship to modernity, a contemporary metaphor representing purity. Those who are labeled as unsanitary subjects (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003) threaten community health because of their cultural inferiority and thus their status as matter out of place (Douglas, 1966). This othering is crucial to the maintenance of a healthy identity because the boundaries of the healthy self are never secure (Crawford, 1994). The identification of a \u2018risk group\u2019 is part of this boundary maintenance that creates and legitimizes the stigmatization of already marginalized populations, resulting in their identification with a disease (Goldin, 1994).",

It provides an effective medium for health communication by bridging medical discourses and society, but it also contributes to the formation of social relations and representations around the disease by explaining epidemics in terms of social processes (Herzlich & Pierret, 1989; Joffe, 1999). Further, the media emphasizes dramatic events (Buus & Olsson, 2006; Moeller, 1999) and risks that are easily tied to moral and political agendas (Joffe, 1999), resulting in higher coverage of rare diseases and relatively little coverage of more common ones (Moeller, 1999).",

Media coverage is therefore a good source of data for measuring the dominant stigmatizing discourses during an epidemic. Othering in media coverage is masked by the prominent position of scientists and by cultural reasoning, whereby anthropological terms are used to describe a population's inferiority vis-\u00e0-vis their culture (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003).

Audiences may instead respond to the messages of reassurance (Ungar, 1998) and locate the risk of infection among those othered by news coverage (Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002). Stigmatized populations may reject being labeled as at-risk by not complying with public health measures that would confirm their inferiority (Nations & Monte, 1996), while sanitary citizens may position themselves outside the defined risk category to create a sense of protection (Briggs, 2004; Joffe, 1999).

Bergeron & Sanchez, 2005; Person, Sy, Holton, Govert, & Liang, 2004; Schram, 2003; Washer, 2004; Wilson, Thomson, & Mansoor, 2004). Several noted that this sensationalization resulted in the stigmatization of Asians around the world (Person et al., 2004; Schram, 2003), and poor care for those suspected of carrying SARS (Karlberg & Lai, 2003). Wallis and Nerlich (2005) provide a detailed review of the metaphors used throughout the epidemic in British media. They conclude that the usual stigmatizing metaphors and militaristic language were largely absent, perhaps marking a shift in how the media covers disease. In contrast, Washer's study (2004), which samples only articles from March 2003, identifies many instances of othering directed toward Chinese people. My review of American media coverage throughout 2003 more closely mirrors Washer's data. As I will illustrate in the subsequent section, understanding the media's role in risk perception requires identifying the media discourses contained in individuals\u2019 explanations of risk and precautionary measures, and connecting these to the local historical and political-economic context. Though the media identified many factors that contributed to the epidemic, I argue that othering discourses that fit personal experience and local concerns have more influence on social responses during a frightening epidemic.",

(Indeed, this problematizes the notion of community.) This research has shown that these two processes can occur simultaneously.

Othering hampers the containment of contagion during an infectious epidemic by compelling people to reject public health instructions (Briggs, 2004; Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Nations & Monte, 1996). Furthermore, it hinders the curtailment of emerging and re-emerging infections by normalizing illnesses affecting marginalized populations. Risk discourses that attribute disease to intractable \u201ctradition\u201d label the sick as willfully dangerous and inferior (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Farmer, 1992). The result is that these populations are blamed for their own infection, and their higher rates of illness confirm their inferiority and marginalization. Thus, sufficient investment in fighting diseases is only justified when they threaten wealthy populations, for whom infection is considered aberrant. As is evident from the 2003 SARS epidemic, international concerns about emerging infections are uni-directional: they are only of importance when they \u201cemerge\u201d from a poor population to threaten a wealthy one (Farmer, 2003). Diseases such as tuberculosis have therefore been allowed to persist among the world's marginalized, contributing to these pathogens\u2019 mutation and drug resistance (Farmer, 1999).",

Indeed, many of the discourses in Chinatown reflect concerns related to the processes of globalization that restructure economies and encourage migration. Further, globalization has created global cities, such as New York City, and transnational family networks that are connected by rapid international air travel (Ali & Keil, 2006). SARS dramatically demonstrates the possibilities for rapid worldwide spread of infections and the need for a coordinated global public health body. Cultural change as a solution to infection diverts attention from the poverty, poor sanitation, and deterioration of public health systems that facilitate the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, both in the United States and abroad (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Farmer, 1992). Without access to appropriate drugs and vaccines, emerging infections, such as a potential influenza pandemic, will likely be very severe (Weiss & McMichael, 2004). As cultural scholars, we must draw attention to the social and biological causes of disease and actively work to find ways to correct the historically entrenched pattern of using cultural reasoning to blame infection on the \u201cOther.\u201d",
