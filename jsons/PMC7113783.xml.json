            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family, and based on antigenic diversity, DENV can be divided into four different serotypes (Halsey et al., 2012). The virus has an 11-kb RNA genome that is translated into a polyprotein and is subsequently cleaved by both host and virus NS2B/NS3 protease into at least 10 mature viral proteins (Lee et al., 2015a). Three structural proteins (capsid, prM, and envelope) distinguish DENV serotypes and regulate DENV attachment and entry. Seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) are indispensable for DENV replication and are highly conserved across DENV serotypes (Dalrymple et al., 2015). DENV is an arthropod-borne pathogen that is propagated by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Salazar et al., 2007). DENV infection causes a spectrum of symptoms ranging from acute self-limiting febrile illness to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Jones et al., 2005, Ubol et al., 2008). The geographic range of dengue is extensively increasing due to urbanization and global warming, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas (McMichael et al., 2006). Approximately 400 million people in over 100 countries are exposed to the threat of DENV infection (Bhatt et al., 2013, Ubol et al., 2008). Currently, the tetravalent dengue vaccine exhibits limited efficacy (Screaton et al., 2015). Hence, the discovery of alternative strategies to decrease the burden of DENV infection is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Innate cellular immune responses, especially interferon alpha/beta (IFN \u03b1/\u03b2)-mediated antiviral signaling, are the most important action against viral replication and pathogenesis (Jones et al., 2005, Morrison et al., 2013). In general, virus infection induces the production and secretion of type I IFN, which interacts with cell surface IFN-\u03b1 receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) on virus-infected and nearby cells. IFN-\u03b1 receptors receive stimulation from type I IFN, leading to the activation of Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases via tyrosine phosphorylation. Subsequently, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1/2) are phosphorylated, after which they form heterodimers. The STAT1/2 heterodimers translocate to the nucleus and bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), leading to the upregulation of hundreds of cellular genes and the induction of antiviral responses (Morrison et al., 2013). Conversely, knockout mice that lack IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptors or exhibit deficiencies in type I IFN production are susceptible to DENV infection (Johnson and Roehrig, 1999, Shresta et al., 2004). Clinically, low levels of type I IFN have been observed in patients with severe dengue-associated disease, revealing that the IFN system plays an important role in preventing DENV infection and pathogenesis (Jones et al., 2005, Ubol et al., 2008). Several reports demonstrated that IFN-stimulated genes and proteins could inhibit DENV replication, such as IFN-induced transmembrane protein 2 and 3 (IFITM2 and IFITM3), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, and 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L (OAS) (Jiang et al., 2010, Simon-Loriere et al., 2015); thus, boosting the IFN-mediated antiviral response might represent a potent strategy against DENV infection.",

Celastrol is a quinone methide triterpene and the most abundant bioactive constituent isolated from the root extracts of T. wilfordii (Ju et al., 2015). Celastrol is a meal supplement that is comprehensively used in herbal medicine because of its diverse biological activities, such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, hepatoprotection, and immunomodulation (Youn et al., 2014). Moreover, celastrol exhibits antiviral activity against HIV and SARS-CoV via different mechanisms (Ryu et al., 2010, Youn et al., 2014). To date, no investigations of the anti-DENV activity of celastrol have been reported. In this study, our data revealed that celastrol inhibits DENV replication by upregulating IFN-\u03b1 production and activating JAK\u2013STAT signaling in hepatoma cells. Celastrol also provided a protective effect against life-threatening DENV-2 infection in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suckling mice.",

To investigate whether celastrol exhibits anti-DENV activity, we treated DENV-2\u2013infected Huh-7 cells with the drug at various concentrations for 3 days. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of celastrol on DENV RNA replication. In the meantime, the cytotoxic effect of DENV-infected cells (Fig. 1B) and na\u00efve Huh-7 cells (Fig. S2) were tested using the MTS assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, celastrol proportionally reduced DENV RNA replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.12 \u00b1 0.011 \u03bcM, and it was not cytotoxic at effective antiviral concentrations. Western blotting was then performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of celastrol on DENV protein synthesis, and similar to the result for DENV RNA replication, celastrol concentration-dependently reduced DENV NS2B protein level (Fig. 1C). In addition, celastrol concentration-dependently decreased the viral titer compared with the celastrol-untreated cells (Fig. 1D). To further examine the inhibitory effect of celastrol on RNA replication in different DENV serotypes, Huh-7 cells were infected with DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4.

To further confirm whether celastrol stimulated JAK\u2013STAT pathways, we first treated DENV-infected Huh-7 cells with celastrol at 0.2 \u03bcM for different time periods, and STAT1/2 phosphorylation levels were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5\nA, Celastrol treatment increases the levels of STAT1/2 phosphorylation in a time dependent manner. To further confirm the role of STAT1/2 in celastrol anti-DENV activity, shRNA against STAT1/2 was employed to silence STAT1/2 expression. As shown in Fig. 5B, celastrol effectively reduced DENV protein replication (lanes 1 and 2), and the STAT1-and STAT2-specific shRNA (lanes 3 and 4) partially restored the anti-DENV effect of celastrol. Relative to the depletion of STAT1 or STAT2 alone, depletion of both STAT1 and STAT2 exerted a restorative effect on DENV protein replication (lane 5). To further clarify the contribution of celastrol-induced IFN-\u03b1 expression to STAT1/2 phosphorylation, the STAT1/2 upstream kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 were inhibited using a Jak1-specific inhibitor and Tyk2-specific shRNA. As shown in Fig. 5C, the Jak1-specific inhibitor effectively attenuated the anti-DENV effect of celastrol compared with the findings in celastrol-treated and untreated cells (lanes 1\u20133), and Tyk2-specific shRNA exerted a restoration effect on DENV protein replication (lanes 1, 4, and 5). These data indicated that the anti-DENV activity of celastrol was mediated by IFN-\u03b1.",

In this study, the comprehensive anti-DENV mechanisms of celastrol were demonstrated, and the antiviral IFN response was thoroughly investigated. The data indicate that the antiviral activity of celastrol in DENV-infected cells occurred together with the upregulation of IFN-\u03b1 expression (Fig. 4), which echoes the findings of Diamond et al. on IFN modulation in DENV-infected human cells (Diamond et al., 2000). The retinoic acid inducible gene I signaling pathway and its downstream molecules, such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling, IPS-1, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7, are critical for IFN production (Chen et al., 2013, Nasirudeen et al., 2011). Future studies should be performed to determine which IFN-activated pathway contributes to the anti-DENV effect of celastrol to obtain additional information for designing anti-DENV agents.",

Moreover, we found that the OAS gene family, which is downstream of STAT1 and STAT2, was stimulated by celastrol (Fig. 6). Similar results were observed in DENV-infected ICR suckling mouse brain tissue (Fig. 7). On the basis of the findings presented in this study, we propose a model to demonstrate the action of celastrol against DENV infection (Fig. 8\n). Simon-Loriere et al. demonstrated that the OAS gene family exhibits high anti-DENV activity, and these data supported our findings (Simon-Loriere et al., 2015). However, DENV infection results in the inhibition of antiviral IFN signaling, which is attributable to DENV NS2B/NS3 protease-mediated cleavage of human mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA) (Yu et al., 2012), NS4A-mediated inhibition of TBK1/IRF3 phosphorylation (Dalrymple et al., 2015), and NS5 replicase-mediated inhibition of STAT2 expression (Morrison et al., 2013). The inhibitory effect of celastrol on DENV NS2B/NS3 protease, NS4A, or NS5 replicase might in part contribute to its anti-DENV activity. This hypothesis should be investigated in the future.",

            "text": "In the decades, numerous groups intend to develop direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for treating DENV infection. However, the high replication rate of DENV and low fidelity of NS5 RNA polymerase may lead to DAA-resistant variants, representing a major challenge in anti-DENV DAA development (Lim et al., 2013). In addition, the efficacy of DAAs against different serotypes of DENV may be different (Lim et al., 2013). Therefore, enhancing host innate immunity exerts protective effects against DENV progression, such as IFN activation, representing a potential tactic to avoid drug resistance and the effects of genetic variability in the viral genome (Lim et al., 2013, Morrison et al., 2013). Numerous studies illustrated that type I IFN is involved in the pathogenesis of DENV infection and the progression from undifferentiated febrile illness (DF) to life-threatening infection (DHF/DSS) (Jones et al., 2005, Ubol et al., 2008). Viral loads and the circulating levels of DENV NS1 antigen are the most important differences between DF and DHF in patients (Chuang et al., 2016, Halstead, 2015b). The high circulating levels of DENV NS1 antigen result in the enhancement of DENV infection via virus-antibody complexes. Furthermore, the intracellular innate responses against DENV are suppressed by interactions between virus-antibody complexes and Fc receptors (Chareonsirisuthigul et al., 2007, Huang et al., 2006), resulting in increased DENV replication and progression to DHF and DSS (Halstead, 2015a). Therefore, celastrol-induced IFN may function as a potential anti-DENV factor and exert cytoprotective effects against DENV-associated cell damage and the life-threatening symptoms associated with DHF and DSS. Further study is necessary to elucidate the effects of celastrol against the pathogenesis of DENV infection and progression to DHF and DSS.",
