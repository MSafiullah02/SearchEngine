            "text": "Automatically recognizing an existing semantic relation (such as \"is a\", \"part of\", \"property of\", \"opposite of\" etc.) between two arbitrary words (phrases, concepts, etc.) is an important task affecting many information retrieval and artificial intelligence tasks including query expansion, common-sense reasoning, question answering, and database federation. Currently, two classes of approaches exist to classify a relation between words (concepts) X and Y: (1) path-based and (2) distributional. While the path-based approaches look at word-paths connecting X and Y in text, the distributional approaches look at statistical properties of X and Y separately, not necessary in the proximity of each other. Here, we suggest how both types can be improved and empirically compare them using several standard benchmarking datasets. For our distributional approach, we are suggesting using an attentionbased transformer. While they are known to be capable of supporting knowledge transfer between different tasks, and recently set a number of benchmarking records in various applications, we are the first to successfully apply them to the task of recognizing semantic relations. To improve a path-based approach, we are suggesting our original neural word path model that combines useful properties of convolutional and recurrent networks, and thus addressing several shortcomings from the prior path-based models. Both our models significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art within its type accordingly. Our transformer-based approach outperforms current state-of-the-art by 1-12% points on 4 out of 6 standard benchmarking datasets. This results in 15-40% error reduction and is closing the gap between the automated and human performance by up to 50%. It also needs much less training data than prior approaches. For the ease of re-producing our results, we make our source code and trained models publicly available.",

Meanwhile, modeling higher level abstract knowledge still remains a challenging problem even for them. This includes classification of semantic relations: given a pair of concepts (words or word sequences) to identify the best semantic label to describe their relationship. The possible labels are typically \"is a\", \"part-of\", \"property-of\", \"made-of\", etc. This information is useful in many applications. For example, knowing that London is a city is needed for a Question Answering system to answer the question What cities does the River Thames go through? Information retrieval benefits from query expansion with more specific words, e.g. transportation disasters \u2192 railroad disasters. For the task of database federation, an attribute in one database (e.g. with values France, Germany, and UK ) often needs to be automatically matched with an attribute called country in another database. Knowing the semantic relations allows large-scale knowledge base construction [11, 23, 33] , automated inferencing [6, 29] , query understanding [31] , post-search navigation [7] , and personalized recommendation [34] . The connection between word meanings and their usage is prominent in the theories of human cognition [12] and human language acquisition [2] . While manually curated dictionaries exist, they are known to be outof-date, not covering specialized domains, designed to be used by people, and exist for only a few well resourced languages (English, German, etc.). Therefore, here we are interested in methods for automated discovery (knowledge acquisition, taxonomy mining, etc.). As our Sect. 2 elaborates, this problem has been a subject of extensive exploration for more than three decades. Our results here suggest that knowledge transfer, that was recently demonstrated to be useful for the other tasks, can be also successfully applied to recognizing semantic relations leading to substantial performance improvements and needing much less training data.",

The earliest path-based approach is typically attributed to \"Hearst Patterns\" [5] -a set of 6 regular expressions to detect \"is-a\" relations (e.g. Y such as X ). Later works successfully involved trainable templates and larger texts (e.g. [18, 27] ). However, a major limitation in relying on patterns in the word paths is the sparsity of the feature space [14] . Distributed representation do not have such limitations, thus with deep neural representations (\"embeddings\", e.g. [13, 17] ) becoming popular, a number of successful models were developed that used word embeddings as features (concatenation, dot product or difference) and surpassed the path-based methods in performance [15, 20] , to the point that the path-based approaches were perceived not be adding anything to the distributional ones.",

            "text": "Intuitive Description. Our proposed path-based neural model combines useful properties of convolutional and recurrent networks, while resolving several shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art model [25] as we explain below. Figure 1 presents an informal intuitive illustration. We jointly train our semantic classification along with an unsupervised language modeling (LM) task. The output of LM is the probability of occurrence of any input word sequence. We use some of those probabilities as features for our relation classification model. Inspired by the success of convolutional networks (CNNs), we use a fixed set of trainable filters (also called kernels), which learn to respond highly to certain patterns that are indicative of specific semantic relations. For example, a specific filter f i can learn to respond highly to is a (and similar) patterns. At the same time, our recurrent LM may suggest that there is a high probability of occurrence of the sequence green is a color in raw text corpus. Combining those two facts suggests that green belongs to the category color (true is-a relation between them). Figure 1 shows only three convolutional filters (and the probabilities of the sequences P 1 , P 2 , P 3 ), while in our current study we used up to 16. Thus, the LM probabilities act as approximate (\"soft\") pattern matching scores: (1) similar patterns receive similar scores with the same filter and (2) similar filters produce similar scores for the same pattern. LM also reduces the need for using many filters as explained by the following intuitive example: While training, LM can encounter many examples of sequences like green is a popular color and green is a relaxing color. By modeling the properties of a language, LM learns that removing an adjective in front of a noun does not normally result in a large drop of the probability of occurrence, so the sequence green is a color also scores highly even if it never occurs in the corpus.",

By using LM we avoid facing the question how to aggregate the context vectors representing each path existing in the corpus. (2) The other relative strength of our approach over the baseline comes from the fact that our model does not \"anonymize\" the word paths unlike [25] , which uniformly uses \"x\" and \"y\" for the path ends regardless of which words the target pair (x,y) actually represents. Without the use of LM, this anonymizing is unavoidable to generalize to the previously unseen (x,y) pairs, but it also misses the opportunity for the model to transfer knowledge from similar words.",

As it is commonly done, we report the results computed on the test sets with the hyper-parameter and the number of training iterations that maximize the F 1 scores on the validation sets, thus using exactly the same metrics and procedures as were used to obtained the baseline results: scikit-learn [16] with the \"weighted\" set-up, which computes the metrics for each relation, and reports their average, weighted by support (the number of true instances for each relation). For HypeNet datasets, that was accordingly set to \"binary\". We also verified through personal communications with the authors of [24] that our metrics are numerically identical for the same sets of predicted labels. For our path-based models, all the trainable parameters were initialized by a normal distribution around 0 average and standard deviation of 1. We used the same transformer architecture and hyper-parameters as in [4] (BERT monolingual English uncased version) which has 12 layers and the output vector size of 768, resulting in the total number of trainable parameters of 110 million. As it is commonly done when using a pre-trained transformer, we initialize our weights to those that were already trained by [4] for a language model and next sentence prediction tasks on a copy of English Wikipedia text and the BookCorpus. For consistency with the data used during pre-training, we add the same special markers before, between and after our input word sequences x and y. Table 2 presents our results. For additional comparison, we also include \"Before Baseline\" row, which lists the baselines used in [24, 25] .

Those differences are statistically significant at the level of .01. There are no statistically significant differences on HypeNet Random and K&H+N. This suggests that an attention-based transformer is a very powerful mechanism for modeling semantic relations. Although they have been shown to be very effective in many other applications where knowledge transfer between tasks is essential, this is the first study that has used them for semantic relations.

It can be seen that the state-of-the-art approaches have already achieved the human level on the datasets where no improvement was detected (HypeNet Random and K&H+N), so this may explain why our approaches did not substantially improve them any further. Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of error reduction on the four datasets on which our approaches improved the state-of-the-art. For comparison, we plot the semantic relation classification error calculated as 100 \u2212 F 1 score rounded to the nearest integer. It can be seen that our approaches have approximately reduced the errors on those \"unsolved\" datasets half-way from the baseline to the human level. We believe that this result is truly remarkable! For additional comparison, we also include our results along with the results of other recent works that looked at semantic relations classification even though those works did not claim to exceed the state-of-the-art approaches presented in [24, 25] . We report the metric of Average Precision (AP) used in those studies and the results on the two datasets (Bless and Evalution) also commonly used in them. We did not use the other datasets for comparison since they are much smaller and relying on manual part of speech tags (nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.).

The results suggest the importance of the dataset size and the possibility of further improvements when more training data is available for the path-based.

Meanwhile, general words (like \"car\", \"book\", \"new\", etc.) are very rarely classified as members of any categories in this dataset since the model correctly sees that they are not named entities. Those observations suggest that what the transformer actually learns for this datasets is to use the combined properties of a word sequence (n-gram) to check if it can possibly be a named entity, and then if it topically fits the category (e.g. \"aviation\" in general). Those two conditions are sufficient to make a positive classification and to obtain high scores since very few test categories in the dataset are closely related (e.g. \"airport\" and \"airline\"). While our neural path models don't make such mistakes, their mistakes are primarily due to no word paths existing between the candidates in the training corpus, which was already noted in the related prior work. This suggests that a combination of those two approaches may provide additional gains over each. We have left more formal exploration of those observations for future studies.",

Using six standard datasets, we have demonstrated that both distributional and word path state-of-the-art approaches can be tangibly improved. Out of those two approaches that we suggested, the transformer-based distributional approach worked significantly better. It has decreased the gap between the current strong baselines and human performance by roughly 50% for those datasets that still had room for improvement. We are not aware of any other work applying a pre-trained attention-based transformer (ABT) for this task.
