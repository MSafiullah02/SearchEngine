Different factors have been studied but the potential influence of pathogens has never been investigated. Sex differences especially in hormones and resource allocation generate a differential response to pathogens and thereby shape sex differences in lifespan or aging. We provide an integrative framework linking host pathogenic environment with both sex-specific selections on immune performance and mortality trajectories. We propose future directions to fill existing knowledge gaps about mechanisms that link sex differences, not only to exposition and sensitivity to pathogens, but also to mortality patterns, whilst emphasizing the urgent need to consider the role of sex in medicine.",

Differences in life-history strategies between sexes driven by sexual selection are among the most common explanations [6]. However, evidence that sexual selection mostly shapes sex differences in lifespan remains equivocal [2]. Here, we highlight that sexual selection, by selecting for traits and behaviors that increase male reproductive success, also leads males to be more exposed to pathogens than females.",

In humans and wild vertebrate populations, aging of the adaptive immune system may occur earlier in males [7,8]. These different patterns of immunosenescence could occur between sexes due to a variety of interactions between physiological factors and the local environmental context. For instance, more intense stimulation of immune defenses through a greater pathogen exposure could contribute to earlier aging of the male immune system, leading to an earlier onset of their actuarial senescence. In support, HIV-1-infected individuals experience immunologic changes similar to uninfected elderly persons as a result of the continuous stimulation of their immune system [9]. However, the contribution of immunosenescence to the observed sex differences in lifespan and aging within and across mammals is yet to be deciphered. We argue that sex-specific immune responses and sex Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 differences in energy allocation strategies driven by sexual selection, by leading to differences in both exposure and susceptibility to pathogens, should result in an accelerated immunosenescence in males through immune exhaustion. If this hypothesis is correct, sex differences in lifespan, through either direct (host mortality) or indirect (faster immunosenescence) effects, could be modulated according to the pathogenic environment of populations [2] (Figure 1 ) and have direct consequences in human as well as veterinarian medicine (Box 2). Although the sample size was limited, a preliminary analysis of currently available data supports this hypothesis with sex differences of lifespan increasing in favor of females when pathogen richness increases (Box 3).",

For example, in adult mice (Mus musculus) males display more symptoms of sickness than females when they are exposed to bacteria that cause an illness with symptoms similar to the flu [11]. Women have more than 40% less HIV-1 RNA loads than men [12], while Italian men infected by the SARS-CoV-2 are approximately twice more likely to die than infected women [13]. Beyond obvious morphological, anatomical, and behavioral differences (e.g. aggressiveness) that might affect exposure to pathogens, many other biological differences may contribute to observed sex differences in the susceptibility or disease progression [14]. Yet these differences remain little studied and data on the underlying biological mechanisms are surprisingly scarce, while they lead to different responsiveness to treatment between sexes [14] (see Box 2).",

Most of them express multiple sex hormone receptors that drive sex-specific immune responses following antigen stimulation [7] . Males and females differ in steroid concentrations: males have a higher concentration of testosterone and females a greater concentration of estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen receptors are detected in immune cell populations, including lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages [18] , and have an immunoenhancing effect as well as diverse protective effects [19] . On the contrary, progesterone and testosterone have mainly immunosuppressive effects [20] . Folstad and Karter [21] proposed that testosterone has, in fact, a double-sword effect that increases the probability of mating for a male while decreasing its ability to fight over pathogens. For instance, territorial male chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) have almost six times more fecal androgen metabolites and are three times more parasitized during the rut period than non-territorial males [22] . Hence, we may expect that males will develop stronger disease symptoms resulting in a lower probability to survive and thereby increased between-sex differences of lifespan in pathogenrich environments. However, inconsistencies among studies of vertebrate species (e.g. Cape ground squirrels, Xerus inauris [23] ) suggest that testosterone is not all story.",

However, infectious diseases that are acquired during pregnancy or lactation are often associated with lower birth mass and reduced breast-milk in humans, suggesting that females reactivate the formally quiescent immune system [25] to combat infection at the expense of reproduction. For example, women who contract malaria during pregnancy have higher circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn are associated with lower birth mass [26] .

For instance, the growth and maintenance of secondary sexual traits impair male immune performance through a resource-based allocation trade-off [28], making them more sensitive to pathogens [29] (Figure 1 ). Many observations in rodents, birds, and insects document substantial energetic, reproductive, and survival costs of immune activation [30] . Hence, organismal responses to pathogens should involve sex differences given that the optimal solution to the trade-off between reproduction and survival differs between sexes, with females allocating more than males to their immune responses to not jeopardize their survival and increase thereby their lifetime reproductive success [27] . We can even expect that iteroparous females should rapidly redirect their energy to immune functions J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 at the expense of fetus/offspring survival when exposed to a pathogen during pregnancy. The optimal strategy should be radically different in semelparous females who only have one opportunity to reproduce. For example, parasite removal reduces reproducing female survival in the Taiwan field mouse (Apodemus semotus), possibly by allowing breeding females to increase maternal investment (i.e. allocation at the cost of their future survival [31]). By contrast, in males, immune performance is impaired by the growth and maintenance of secondary sexual traits, which makes them more sensitive to pathogens [28] . In mice, increased aggression is costly and is associated with reduced resistance to disease [32] . As a consequence, sex differences of lifespan should increase in favor of females when pathogen load increases (Box 3).",

The reliable measurement of multiple markers of both immunity (e.g. cellular components, T cell repertoire) and aging (e.g. epigenetic markers of biological age [35]) remains challenging. However, such metrics are required to allow a better understanding of the ecological (pathogen exposure) and evolutionary forces that shape the sex-specific decline of immune responses and between-sex differences in lifespan. Ideally, these measures should be made in wild populations, which display a large variation in the magnitude of sex differences in lifespan (see [2]) because of differential risk-taking behavior, food requirements, mortality due to direct sexual competition, or exposition to commensal and pathogenic organisms. Longitudinal studies are thus required to assess how immunosenescence patterns are shaped according to sex (see for example [36] , and references in [8] ) and also to identify mortality causes, which allows deciphering the different ways through which pathogens reduce individuals' lifespan (through early deaths from lethal diseases or through advanced immunosenescence due to immune exhaustion).

Notably, the chronic infection by the common CMV (cytomegalovirus) is involved in the remodeling of the immune system. Hence chronic exposition to any microbial agent (i.e. not only known pathogens) could be both implied in shaping sex-specific immunosenescence [40] .

This potentially accelerates an organism's deterioration, ultimately leading to its death.

[54] highlighted that two immune pathways, the cytokine IL-6 and TLR3 proinflammatory signaling pathways, are positively associated with the lifespan of centenarian men but not women. This suggests that dysregulation of these proinflammatory pathways with age makes elderly men more susceptible to infectious pathogens than elderly women.

One reason for this is that sex differences in immune functions are not well understood yet.",

This could explain the higher number of secondary effects observed in women than in men following the commercialization of a given drug [56] . Upon vaccination, women develop a higher antibody immune response, but also more frequent and severe adverse side effects than men [57] . The application of sex-specific medicine is thus urgently required [56] . The American National Institute of Health recently declared that clinical trials not taking sex-specific responses into account will no longer be funded [58] .",

However, very little is known about how much information from inbred and laboratory-adapted mice can be extrapolated to mammalian immune responses in the wild [59] . First, the selection of laboratory mice has resulted in the alteration of life-history traits (such as reproduction or lifespan, see [60] ) and immunological animals is thus crucially needed to reveal both the relevance and limitations of laboratory animals as immunological models. Linking wild and laboratory animal immunology by using tools and concepts of immunology, but also of ecology and evolutionary biology, is badly needed. In that respect, companion animals, which live in the same environment as their owners and are exposed to similar pathogens [61] , may potentially serve as bridges between laboratory and wild species. The affordability of new 'omic' approaches and the availability of new trusted biomarkers (e.g. antibodies, cytokines, cellular responses) and immunological reagents (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) will help to quantify male and female exposition to microbes and the dysregulation of immune parameters with increasing age in a wider range of mammalian species, aiding immunologists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists to work altogether.",

Available information so far calls for an appropriate inclusion of sex differences over the whole human life span to anchor medicine in the real word (see Box 2). Longitudinal studies combining detailed immunological and nonimmunological follow-ups for individuals of each sex should help to understand aging of the immune processes and how it differs between sexes and environments (see Outstanding Questions). By taking into account the evolutionary history of mammalian species, such a holistic approach could help explain between-sex differences in lifespan. For instance, studies should focus on consequences of resistance and tolerance of pathogens on lifespan across mammals (see Outstanding Questions).
