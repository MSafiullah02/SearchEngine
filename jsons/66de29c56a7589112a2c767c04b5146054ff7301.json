Therefore, it is difficult to ensure that cluster infection does not occur in families during the isolation period for at least 2 weeks unless excellent infection control is implemented (Mao et al., 2020) . This requires sufficient knowledge and proper measures, but for ordinary people and families, especially those living together in a narrow space, is obviously hard to meet, causing other family members to be infected. Subsequently, the asymptomatic carriers or infected individuals have not been diagnosed will become a key factor of community outbreak (Yu and Yang, 2020) . A small portion of patients do not strictly adhere to stay at home, go shopping, exercise or other social activities, which brings high risk to other close contacts. The transmissions eventually lead to a surge of infections, which places huge pressure on city's health-care system operating over its maximum capacity and soon overwhelmed (Kandel et al., 2020) . Therefore, we consider that for newly confirmed COVID-19 patients, especially the elderly and those with preexisting diseases, home isolation should be carefully chosen.",

FC quarantine minimizes the spread size of COVID-19 among family and community and has been proved in effectively fighting against COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China (Pan et al., 2020) . Notably, a FC hospital is far more than a hospital simply for physical isolation or mere treatment either. Instead, it builds a small society with enriched environment to maintain the health status of COVID-19 patients, thus promoting their rehabilitation and preventing the deterioration comparing to home isolation . It will help to save medical resources in the region and even the whole country.",
