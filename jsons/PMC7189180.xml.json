This paper evaluates the growth of dysfunctional policymaking in the U.S. compared with earlier history and proposes a countering approach. Policy failures often reflect partisan policy stalemate with a drifting status quo, errors or unintended consequences, polarized extremism or imbalance, or partisan reversals with changes in power. Extremes in partisanship are not new historically, but growing policy failures due to negative partisanship have now severely damaged public trust in institutions. We describe three complementary explanations, which suggest that non-cooperative partisan policymaking has become self-reinforcing, and institutional changes to promote cooperation should focus on lowering the risk-adjusted cost\u2013benefit ratio, making cooperation safer and more attractive for policymakers. We propose a disruptive new form of presidential leadership joined with other approaches to improvement.",

            "text": "Government policymaking dysfunction from partisan polarization is generally seen as a corrosive failure of institutions (Thurber and Yoshinaka 2015). Much of it being reflected in a lost sense of governing trust (or social contract) and many deadlocked unmet policy needs. Over 80% of Americans have said the country is greatly divided about important values, with 77% saying they are dissatisfied with the state of politics (Summers 2018). About 70% to 90% have said they are very concerned with the deepened polarization, bitterness, disrespect, contempt, and even hatred between groups (Brooks 2018a, 2019). A December 2018 New Hampshire poll found more voters viewing political dysfunction (74%) and disunity (68%) as a threat to America than any other major issue (Troiano 2019). After the 2018 midterm elections, The Economist (2018) emphasized America\u2019s divisions and prospects for poor policymaking with both sides declaring victory. Most of the public expected gridlock through 2020 (Pew Research 2018), and, as in previous years, this has been a good general forecast.",

            "text": "With many unaddressed policy tradeoffs and needs, political candidates can seek or rise to power through major policy failures, failures that are inflated, embellished, and aggrandized, or alignment with specific voter protest or identity groups. Unmet needs in turn encourage more power-play policymaking or obstruction (e.g., laws passed or blocked along party-line votes) and more ominously, authoritarian tendencies. To counter these trends, we suggest that a new form of social contract between the dominant governing parties may be possible through a reframing of policymaking interactions to encourage better governing norms. A recent RAND study (Kavanagh and Rich 2018) found that in earlier periods of turmoil, a revival of factual policy analysis and journalism and a focus on holding leaders accountable helped clarify the line between opinion and fact. A similar renewal today might re-orient policymaking to more fact-based rationality, assessment, and purpose (Perl et al. 2018). Our proposal requires leadership but no new laws. More \u201cparty blind\u201d \u201cauditioning\u201d conditions in policy formulation may better balance and improve cooperative policymaking. We propose a new presidential administration with bipartisan leadership inclusion in policymaking.",

Prior to 2017, recent decades of legislative changes or corrections in policy have not appeared to systematically advantage either conservatives or liberals (Curry and Lee 2019; Lee 2015). With a few landmark exceptions generally realized through unilateral power, the limited laws that have passed have not included many potential larger or more difficult changes. More difficult policy improvements requiring broader bipartisan support persistently fail to succeed legislatively or even reach the floor of the Senate or House for votes.1",

New administration policies (several more extreme), judicial appointments, and legislation or legislative attempts, with Congressional support or acquiescence, rescinded or reversed the directions of many previous Obama administration policies and longstanding bipartisan approaches.2 The shift of the Supreme Court and judiciary to the right has grown as Trump and the GOP-controlled Senate have enacted the long-term strategy of the Federalist Society and beyond with several doctrinaire judges appointed despite ratings of \u2018unqualified\u2019 by the American Bar Association. (In comparison, none of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees were rated unqualified.) Senate denials blocked many of Obama\u2019s nominees, culminating in the unprecedented 9-month refusal to give Obama\u2019s last high-court nominee a hearing. Since the power shift in Congress after the 2018 midterms, GOP Senate leader McConnell has returned to his previous obstructive tactics, blocking from consideration nearly 400 bills passed in the Democratic-controlled House (Axelrod 2019; Martin 2019).",

The growth over time of multiple policymaking powers concentrated in the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d and \u201cexecutive federalism\u201d has significantly enhanced the one-party-dominant policymaking potential gained through electoral victory of the Presidency (Schlesinger 1973; Modie and Curcy 2011; Friedersdorf 2016; Cost 2018; Head 2019a, b; Blow 2019; Thompson et al. 2018).

The group behavior has ideological or identity driven battle-promoting characteristics that differ from a simple sum of individuals. The need to belong, affiliate, reinforce, and elevate one\u2019s group is a strong psychological motivation (Baumeister and Leary 1995). Social identities and the biology of groups (Hornung et al. 2018; Forsyth 2019) incline policymakers toward conformity with party policy views, party loyalty, party-affiliated campaign themes and public expressions, and party-line voting (Bernheim 1994; Cialdini and Goldstein 2004; Berns et al 2005; Yu and Sun 2013; Close 2016; Harell 2018; Cherry 2019). Financial incentives in party-driven or inspired fundraising and ideological views within parties add strong practical constraints against centrist moderation (Mann and Corrado 2014; O'Donnell 2016; Gehl and Porter 2017; Tomasky 2019a). Penalties for non-conformity make it difficult for Independent candidates to compete. Perceived needs to satisfy the \u201cparty base\u201d to stay in power push political decision-makers to conform even where it contradicts a policymaker\u2019s principles.",

Polarized identities with intolerance of \u201cothers,\u201d mistrust, and lowered willingness to negotiate and compromise over opposing policy viewpoints have grown, as have more extreme and caustically expressed political views, elevated by accommodative media coverage of policymaking fights or \u201cbattles.\u201d Trends of politicized evidence and willful ignorance (Perl et al. 2018; Paul and Haddad 2019) have helped to fuel negative partisan views of the \u201cother side\u201d with their \u201cbad people\u201d and \u201cdangerous ideas\u201d (Theodoridis 2016; Hetherington and Rudolph 2015), strangely inventive conspiracy theories, and partisan denials and disagreements on simple facts (Dunning 2016). Low turnout in party primaries and ideologically driven voters have advantaged more extremist candidates with a limited but more mobilized base of support, resulting in a hollowing out of lawmakers with more centrist views in Congress (Wheelan 2013; Gehl and Porter 2017; Mann and Ornstein 2012). Many potential improvements in policy today have effectively become held hostage to the extremes of both parties and a stifled competition of ideas for more creative balanced policy solutions (Alberta 2018; Brooks 2018a, b, 2019). The Trumpian presidential approach has joined with the other previous and ongoing strands of non-cooperative GOP power assertion to further deepen the political divides and loss of trust in policymaking discourse, often justified through odd concoctions from right-wing media, fueling outrage on the left, and leaving a steady barrage of negative partisanship and \u201cour story versus theirs\u201d portrayals.",

Even where risk aversion is lower, due to ambiguity effects policymakers avoid more prolonged negotiating choices with ambiguous or unknown outcomes (Frisch and Baron 1988). Untrustworthy and mercurial negotiating tactics, such as exhibited repeatedly by Trump in Congressional dealings, further forestall any cooperative policymaking progress. Cooperative outcomes are \u201cpayoff dominant,\u201d but non-cooperative outcomes are \u201crisk dominant\u201d (Harsanyi and Selten 1988).

Although the Stag Hunt view allows for a stable equilibrium of policymaking cooperation, it does not solve the problem of cooperation since there is also the non-cooperative equilibrium (Skyrms 2004). A cooperative equilibrium requires that enough policymakers from both parties somehow agree to negotiate in good faith, agree to compromise, and agree to \u201chunt\u201d the larger more lasting bipartisan policy improvements through consistent mutually practiced cooperation.21",

In the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, policy beliefs and incentives to \u201cwin\u201d tend toward every actor defecting, and a winner-take-all mentality, while a re-establishment of cooperation requires a success of higher-order strategies, such as tit-for-tat or alternatives (Axelrod 1984; Wu and Axelrod 1995), which may not be possible or sustainable. In the Stag Hunt, players are incented to cooperate provided that enough others do so as well. The choice to not cooperate is clearly sub-optimal for all in the long run, with usually only short-term gains, even though it dominates by being the safer option. Party partisans differ of course on the large non-cooperative policy battles in recent years, but few can deny the sad state of overall affairs, as reflected on by departing Senators in 2018 (Foran 2018). Social suboptimality persists fundamentally because of the perceived high risk-adjusted cost\u2013benefit ratio of cooperation.",

New institutional conditions to encourage more trust and fewer divergent incentives in key political relationships, which can lower the perceived cost and raise the perceived benefit, are needed for greater policymaking cooperation to become individually rational for each party leader. The proposed new presidential administration with bipartisan leadership inclusion in policymaking takes this approach. Reframing the partisan divides in this way would seek to counter negative partisanship and extremes, re-establish better policymaking interactions and improve governance and policy outcomes.",
