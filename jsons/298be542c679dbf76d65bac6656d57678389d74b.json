These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNAplus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the direction of mutational pressure during translation of viral RNAplus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analogue development for treating covid-19 and other coronavirus infections.",

It bears a close similarity to bat coronaviruses, and similar viral particles have been detected in pangolin. This led to the speculation that the virus must have originated in bats while pangolins must have been intermediate hosts. Since then, the virus has spread all over the globe affecting humans of all races. The infections are characterized by sore throat, fever, cough, body pains, breathlessness, severe pneumonia, and death due to multi-organ failure involving kidneys and lungs. 2, 3 Coronaviruses have an exceptionally large genome of around 30kb. A huge part of the genome, at the 5' end, around 20 kb, harbors a replicase gene that codes for around 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). 4 The rest of the genome, near the 3' end, codes for the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid) and several accessory proteins. 5 The replicase gene (ORF1) includes two subunits, ORF1a and ORF1b expressing the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. A slippery sequence and ribosomal frameshifting caused by an RNA pseudoknot ensure the translation of both polyproteins from the same genome. 6, 7 Pp1a has nsps 1-11 whereas pp1ab has nsps 1-16. 8 The non-structural proteins form the viral replicase complexes. Here both genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs get synthesized through negative-strand intermediates. Sub genomic RNAs code for structural and accessory proteins.",

They may help change the viral phenotype allowing it to evade host immune system and also acquire drug resistance. These variations may arise from copying errors during genome replication. 9 RNA viruses have low replicative fidelity; hence are more prone to mutations than DNA viruses. Around 10 -4 to 10 -6 errors per nucleotide are seen in RNA viruses, which is equivalent to approximately one mutation per genome per replication cycle. This allows the viruses to maintain mutations that are beneficial for them in adapting to new environments. 10 Sometimes, a specific nucleotide mutation occurs more frequently, which is called directional mutational pressure. Mutational pressure changes the nucleotide composition of the genome irreversibly and may be caused due to an error-prone polymerase, RNA editing, oxidative damage. Moreover, the direction of mutational pressure may not be similar along the entire length of the genome. 11 Coronaviruses are known as slowly mutating RNA viruses since they perform proof-reading during replication 12 .",

Fourfold degenerate codons can tolerate any nucleotide substitution at the wobble or the third position, which doesn't change the amino acid sequence. But this changed nucleotide in the RNA may affect the RNA structure, RNA interference, and codon usage bias. 11 Since its first appearance in December, 2019, four hundred full-length sequences of ORF1 of SARS-CoV-2 have become available on GenBank. In this study, a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b has been carried out, taking the first isolate as the parent sequence. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have also been investigated in various coronaviruses. There are no approved drugs or vaccines for human coronaviruses yet.

Calculated frequencies of nucleotide mutations were compared with each other. Since there is a ribosome slippery sequence in the ORF1, we performed calculations separately for two parts of ORF1: ORF1a and ORF1b, before and after the slippery site, respectively. There is a clear and strong mutational U-pressure in both parts of the ORF1 (Table 1) . The most frequent type of nucleotide mutation in SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 during 4 months of the pandemic was cytosine to uracil transition (C to U). The rate of this mutation was found to be more than 6 times higher than the rate of an opposite U to C mutation in ORF1a and more than 4 times higher in ORF1b. The difference between the rate of C to U transitions and the rate of U to C transitions is significant (P < 0.05) for both parts of ORF1. Interestingly, the rate of C to U transitions is also significantly (1.7 times) higher in the ORF1a than in ORF1b. The most frequent cause of this kind of mutation is cytosine deamination, the product of which is uracil. This mutation may be spontaneous or enzymatic. In the latter case, RNA-editing enzymes from APOBEC family may be responsible for it 13 , 14 . These enzymes bind single-stranded viral RNA and deaminate cytosine residues. Spontaneous deamination occurs via oxidation of cytosine by free radicals 16 . The rate of this process is higher for single-stranded RNA than for double-stranded RNA 17 .",

Therefore, ORF1b is not unwound as frequently as ORF1a. The difference between the rates of G to A and A to G transitions was not found to be significant for both parts of ORF1. However, the rate of G to A transitions themselves is significantly higher in ORF1a than in ORF1b (Table 1 ). The rate of G to U transversions is significantly higher than the rate of U to G transversions in both parts of ORF1 (Table 1 ). The rate of G to U transversions is, of course, significantly lower than the rate of C to U transitions. However, both of these mutations do contribute to the mutational Upressure in this viral gene. The rates of other transversions are rather low (Table 1) . Their preferable directions can be determined only after some time when the virus acquires more mutations.

The reason for this growth maybe both in the higher rate of their occurrence and in the weaker negative selection. Indeed, proteins that are cut from the second part of a polyprotein encoded by ORF1b (RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase and helicase, 3'-to-5' exonuclease, endoRNAse, 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase) seem to be more conservative than proteins that are cut from its first part. An interesting fact is that the number of sites with synonymous C to U mutations is lower than the number of sites with nonsynonymous C to U mutations (32 vs. 51) for ORF1a, while for ORF1b it is vice versa (17 vs. 13) .

As one can see in Figure 2a , the difference in average values of U4f in two parts of ORF1 may reach more than 8%, or it may be equal to just 1%. Interestingly, there is a correlation between the difference in U4f and the difference in A4f between two parts of ORF1 (R = -0.66). Indeed, the higher the difference in U4f, the higher (by module) the difference in A4f. The same relationships are there between the difference in U4f and the difference in C4f between two parts of ORF1 (R = -0.72). The difference in A4f, however, shows no correlation on the difference in C4f (R = 0.11). It means that in some viruses, U4f in the first part of ORF1 is increased mostly because of the decrease of A4f, while in others, it is increased mostly because of the decrease of C4f. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the group in which U4f is growing mostly because of the decrease of A4f. The chance of success for ribosome slippage is one of the key factors of viral pathogenesis 24 . According to Figure 2a , SARS-CoV-2 should be able to synthesize more RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase at the onset of infection than SARS-CoV.",

Based on the results of this study, uracil analogues would be more effective in treating COVID-19 than analogues of cytosine and guanine nucleosides. Adenine analogues should be capable of effectively inhibiting the synthesis of RNA-minus strands. So they may also prove to be good therapeutic strategy but only during the early stages of infection.

As inosine (product of adenine deamination) is a non-canonical amine base, it is removed during proof-reading, whereas, uracil (product of cytosine deamination) being a canonical amine base is not removed, as proof-reading activity effectively removes mismatched pairs of canonical nucleotides, i.e., pairs of canonical nucleotides with non-canonical ones, but it cannot recognize U that has already appeared in place of C on a matrix strand before the replication as a mutated nucleotide.

However, roughly one-third of ORF1 at its 5'-end has surprisingly lower U4f values than the middle part, probably because of recombination events. For human coronavirus 229E the rate of successful frameshifting is about 20 -30% 35 , while U4f is 4.56%.
