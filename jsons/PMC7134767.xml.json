This will require partnership and collaborations among nongovernmental organizations, member associations, and academic institutions. There are examples of this sort of partnership on a smaller scale. For instance, the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin and World Heart Federation has conducted several medical camps enlisting U.S.-trained physicians for voluntary work in Southeast Asia and Africa involving medical education, echocardiography scans, rural medical/health camps, and vaccinations. This strategy has the potential to recruit a much larger number of physicians if the pool of cardiology FITs can be recruited. If senior and subspecialty FITs were given the opportunity to pursue a foreign elective rotation for global cardiovascular care during their fellowship, it would not only open up a huge pool of competent physicians for global health endeavors, but would also be a tremendous learning experience for FITs to expand their horizons.",

            "text": "There are several personal barriers to pursuing a global health elective rotation in a foreign country, including finances and medico-legal considerations. However, the most important barriers may be external, including the lack of institutional recognition of the importance of this rotation and the lack of clear guidelines pertaining to training in global cardiovascular disease.1.\nFinancial constraints. Surveys have shown that one of the primary concerns of trainees and early career physicians is repayment of student loans (14). This is complicated by the fact that global health initiatives as an employment opportunity does not compare with the current compensations and expectations of U.S.-based physicians. For instance, the median salary of U.S cardiologists is $425,000 (15), compared with the annual salary of $72,390 to $130,800 for an overseas medical officer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the $1,913 per month (tax deductible) paid by the Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (16). This disparity in remuneration will inevitably result in serious repercussions. Novel federal initiative programs for student loan forgiveness, such as the Global Health Service Partnership (17), which is a public-private collaboration among Seed Global Health, the Peace Corps, and the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, can be very helpful in this regard. The Global Health Service Partnership program provides $30,000 of loan repayment per year of service along with travel and lodging expenses. However, it would be unrealistic to expect that voluntarily working in an economically underdeveloped country would demand comparable remuneration to working full time in the United States. Thus, a certain amount of altruism and sacrifice would need to fill this gap.2.\nLack of dedicated time during training. The absence of a dedicated \u201celective\u201d rotation in certain post-graduate training programs can be a significant deterrent for some. I would recommend that the professional cardiovascular community, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and universities come together to create a global health institute addressing deficiencies in global cardiovascular health curriculum. There are some successful examples: The American Academy of Family Physicians, for example, has a Curriculum Guideline (18) that formally defines the recommended training strategy for family medicine residents. Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine has its own online curriculum (19) for physicians volunteering abroad and to precept students during global health rotations. One of the best examples of residency-level global health experience is the pediatric residency program at University of California (UC) Davis (20). All pediatric residents at UC Davis participate in a core global health curriculum (epidemiology, child survival), which is built into the 36 months of residency training (including dedicated time for international experiences for second- and third-year residents).3.\nMedico-legal challenges. Arranging for a foreign visa and foreign medical license (if needed), and taking care of relevant safety issues would require going through the appropriate diplomatic channels. American citizens can enter 174 countries and territories visa-free or with visa on arrival (21). India, China, Russia, Iran, Vietnam, Belarus, Azerbaijan, and Brazil require a visa. However, this matter is complicated by the fact that many international medical graduates are not U.S. citizens and would be restricted from certain international travel based on their native passport.\n",

            "text": "In the end, if the passion to pursue a career dedicated to global health is what motivates an FIT, he or she can find ways to overcome these challenges.HuffmanMark D.MD, MPHm-huffman@northwestern.eduDepartments of Preventive Medicine and Medicine-Cardiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IllinoisRESPONSE: Global Health Has Not Yet Risen to a Core Training CompetencyDr. Som advocates for greater opportunities and infrastructure for greater global health training during cardiovascular fellowship. He calls on fellowship training programs and the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education to offer more flexibility and guidance to incorporate global health activities within the core training of a cardiovascular medicine fellowship.Despite my own career path, I do not think that global health training has risen to \u201ccore\u201d status within U.S. cardiovascular medicine training programs. However, I agree with Dr. Som that greater clarity would be useful for trainees to understand how different opportunities might be incorporated into their fellowship. In 2015, the American College of Cardiology published its fourth Core Cardiovascular Training Statement, with 15 task forces to guide training programs and fellows on core competencies and milestones on general and subspecialty cardiology fellowship training (1). The statements align with the core competencies outlined by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, which are also endorsed by the American Board of Internal Medicine: 1) medical knowledge; 2) patient care and procedural skills; 3) practice-based learning and improvement; 4) systems-based practice; 5) interpersonal and communication skills; and 6) professionalism. If a fellow can demonstrate how and why a potential global health elective fits into his/her overall training plan and program by strengthening progress toward 1 of these competencies, then he or she will have made a strong case.But fellowship, like other parts of one\u2019s career, is a series of trade-offs. By pursuing one elective, there is less time for another. Yes, there may be logistical hurdles for global health electives, but the larger questions are: what is your passion and what are you uniquely qualified to do? I have been told that global health is not for dabblers, and I might challenge fellows considering global health experiences during fellowship to think bigger\u2014how can you build a career in global health?One place to start might be to imagine the type of training and mentors needed to work on the 12 National Academy of Medicine\u2019s recommendations to improve global cardiovascular health, to which Dr. Som alluded (Table 1\n) (2). The skills and experience needed for epidemiological surveillance, health systems strengthening, and improving access to diagnostics, medicines, and technology are diverse and distinct from most other aspects of cardiology training. The mentors\u2014both in the United States and abroad\u2014will also differ. Advanced training offers the opportunity for deeper understanding and expertise, and global health training is no different.For fellows or programs interested in participating in or developing global health training programs, the Working Group on Ethics Guidelines for Global Health Training were published to guide sending and host institutions, trainees, and sponsors on ethics and best practices (3). Key principles include: 1) developing well-structured, longitudinal programs that meet local needs and provide safe, effective environments for trainees; 2) creating training experiences that are mutually beneficial; 3) ensuring that trainees are \u201ccognizant and respectful of their current capability and level of training\u201d; and 4) ensuring that programs are regularly monitored and evaluated, among others. The time spent developing partnerships that are grounded in trust, respect, and excellence will usually be rewarded on all sides.References1HalperinJ.L.WilliamsE.S.FusterV.COCATS 4 introductionJ Am Coll Cardiol65201517241733257776432Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Preventing the Global Epidemic of Cardiovascular Disease: Meeting the Challenges in Developing CountriesFusterV.KellyB.B.Promoting Cardiovascular Health in the Developing World: A Critical Challenge to Achieve Global Health2010National Academies PressWashington, DC3CrumpJ.A.SugarmanJ.for the Working Group on Ethics Guidelines for Global Health Training (WEIGHT)Ethics and best practice guidelines for training experiences in global healthAm J Trop Med Hyg8320101178118221118918\n",
