Stories in the recent news have highlighted the unusual deadly influenza pandemic lasting from 1918 to 1920, the so\u2010called Spanish flu, highlighting the devastating impact of these viral infections.",

However, this vaccine is mostly strain specific and the process to produce it is time\u2010consuming. In addition, evidence indicates it does not provide protection against emerging zoonotic influenza A virus strains. Overall, the need to develop a novel vaccine conferring protection as broad as possible is widely acknowledged.",

Demminger and colleagues decided to exploit an adeno\u2010associated virus (AAV) vector to express influenza antigens to elicit protective antibody responses. The selection of AAV as vector offers several advantages. AAV cannot replicate in humans, and data indicates they do not induce any pathophysiology. They are easy to produce under Good Manufacturing Practice standards and can be re\u2010administered if needed. Of note, AAV has been already tested to express influenza antigens and showed to confer protection (Lin et al, 2009; Sipo et al, 2011; Xin et al, 2001).",

As expected, all AAV constructs expressing influenza antigens did elicit reactive antibodies that correlated with the total serum IgG titers. Interestingly, AAV vectors induced antibodies against a panel of different influenza viruses. Somewhat unexpectedly, WIV vaccination also elicited broadly reactive antibodies. Interestingly, neutralizing antibodies were found only in the sera of mice challenged with AAV containing HA, or cHA, and these antibodies were specific for the virus used for prime immunization. Of significant therapeutic relevance, authors demonstrated that AAV vector vaccination induced strong Fc\u2010activating antibody response against Cal/7/9 but also against the mouse\u2010adapted heterologous influenza virus PR8.",

Although the mouse model has its limitations in terms of translational potential, it offers the opportunity to obtain first proof\u2010of\u2010concept information. As read\u2010outs of infection, Demminger and co\u2010workers used weight loss and survival of mice over a 14\u2010day period. Mice vaccinated with the AAV construct were protected, and preliminary data suggest that three doses of the vaccine were better than two doses. Although these findings are sound, it is important to note that determination of viral titers in the tissues over time should be determined to solidify the read\u2010outs based on animal behavior, clinical parameters, and/or survival. Some control experiments revealed a reduction in viral titers in vaccinated animals.",

This animal model reproduces very closely the course of human influenza. In these experiments, authors also introduce a group immunized with a commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccine of season 2017/18. Animals were vaccinated intranasally three times in 4\u2010week interval whereas the control group immunized with the commercial vaccine were given two doses by the intramuscular route. It can be argued that the different experimental regime of the groups is not suitable for a comparison between the different vaccine formulations. However, the aim of this work was to demonstrate whether the AAV vectors do confer protection and not whether they are better than the commercial vaccine. In a 3\u2010day infection protocol, ferrets vaccinated with the AAV vectors showed clear signs of recovery assessing serous nasal exudate, congestion, frequent sneezing, wheezing, and depression. Notably, only in those ferrets vaccinated with the AAV\u2010HA construct and the commercial vaccine was there a reduction in the load of virus although no sterile immunity was induced. Virus clearance was associated with a significant reduction in pathophysiology and induction of neutralizing antibodies.",

The use of research models approximating human disease, ferrets in this case, should be a golden standard approach in any work focusing on vaccine development. The value of the mouse model cannot be disregarded but, certainly, the time is ripe to probe models with increasing translational value.",

Among others, I will urge colleagues to consider essential a comprehensive immune profiling at the relevant mucosae coupled with the quantification of cytokines and chemokines.
