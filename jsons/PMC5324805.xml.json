Since the late 1970s, MVEV has largely been maintained in enzootic cycles involving mosquitoes and water fowl in the northern regions of Central and Western Australia; there have been multiple reported epidemics (4). Before the outbreak in 2011, heavy rains across Australia created ideal conditions for Culex annulirostris mosquitoes, the vector of MVEV, thus intensifying transmission to humans throughout the country (5). A shift in the demographic pattern of MVE cases toward non-Aboriginal, adult workers and tourists engaged in high-risk activities for mosquito exposure was observed (1). Australian States and Territories routinely use MVEV surveillance methods (mosquito monitoring, virus isolation from mosquitoes, sentinel chicken flocks, and climate surveillance) (6). Each state and territory has its own public health response and communications strategy (1), which target tourists to various degrees.",

MVE is estimated to occur in <0.1% of infected persons but has a mortality rate of 15%\u201330% and produces long-term neurologic sequelae in <50% of survivors (7\u20139). Several distinct clinical patterns of MVE have been observed: encephalitis with complete recovery; cranial nerve/brainstem involvement with tremor; spinal cord involvement (poliomyelitis-like); and relentless progression to death, as seen in the patient we report (8). The presence of widespread magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities of the thalamus, midbrain, spinal cord, and cerebellum during acute illness predicted a devastating neurologic outcome (10).
