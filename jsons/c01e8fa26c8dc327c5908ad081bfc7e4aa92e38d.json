Most frequently it has been linked with the Guineo-Congolian rain forest block. The present paper aims to test six alternative hypotheses of the zoogeographical relationships between this forest remnant and other African forests using reptiles as a model group. Reptiles are relatively slow dispersers, compared with flying organisms (Aves and Odonata) on which former hypotheses have been based, and may thus result in a more conservative biogeographical analysis.",

Compared with other tropical forest regions this total is not impressively high, but certainly constitutes an underestimate due to a combination of the historical, logistical and political problems associated with herpetological research in Africa. These African forests are also seriously threatened by exploitation. For instance, Uganda has lost about 86% of its original forest cover in the past two decades, and the remaining forests are isolated fragments only (Vonesh, 2001) . Compared with other vertebrate groups, reptiles in East Africa have been poorly studied and little is known about them. There is an urgent need for more baseline data to enable the establishment of efficient herpetological conservation programmes.",

Howell (1993) reviewed the herpetofauna of the Eastern Arc mountain forests, but little is known about the amphibians and reptiles of the rain forests associated with the Congo forest belt (e.g. Budongo, Bwamba, Kibale, Bwindi and Mabira in Uganda) or isolated mountain forests. Species inventories are available only for the Bwindi (Drewes & Vindum, 1991) and Kibale Forests (Vonesh, 2001) . The Kakamega Forest in westernmost Kenya was suggested as being the easternmost fragment of the equatorial rain forest system (Zimmermann, 1972; Drewes, 1976; Hamilton, 1976; Schi\u00f8tz, 1976; Kokwaro, 1988; Vonesh, 2001; Fashing & Gathua, 2004; K\u00f6hler, 2004; Clausnitzer, 2005) and although its amphibian fauna has recently been surveyed (Schick et al., 2005) , its zoogeographical relationships with other forests and fragments of the equatorial rain forest have not been thoroughly analysed.",

Reptiles are excellent zoogeographical indicators as they are comparatively slow dispersers and are less prone to drift events. Thus they can present clear-cut evidence on the relationships between Kakamega Forest and other African forests. We therefore use reptiles as a model group to test the previously proposed hypothesis of the classification of Kakamega Forest as part of the Guineo-Congolian rain forest system (H0 hypothesis), which was mainly based on highly vagile organisms (e.g. Moreau, 1966; Zimmermann, 1972; Clausnitzer, 1999) . The analysis was conducted by setting up and testing six alternative hypotheses which cover all possible relationships between Kakamega Forest and other African rain forests.",

Only 44.55 km 2 of the forest is protected by law (Mitchell, 2004) . The forest is situated between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. and is part of a stratified landscape of the East African Rift Valley, which is situated only 150 km eastwards. The eastern margin of Kakamega Forest is marked by the 2200 m high Nandi Escarpment, which appears to be a montane habitat because the tree fern Cyathea manniana occurs there. The annual precipitation ranges from 1500 to 2300 mm. The annual average temperature is 27\u00b0C in the day and 15\u00b0C at night (K\u00f6hler, 2004) . Two major rivers cross the forest: the Isiukhu River in the north and the Yala River in the south; both drain into the nearby Lake Victoria. The main forest block is surrounded by several smaller forest fragments, which differ in size and in the degree of human disturbance. The most important of these are the protected Kisere forest fragment to the north, and the unprotected but better known Kaimosi fragment to the south. In addition to these forest fragments, two large forest systems of the Nandi escarpment were connected with the Kakamega Forest system until recently. The North Nandi Forest was not connected with Kakamega Forest in the 20th century but there was 'dense forest' in the 1960s between the South Nandi Forest and the Kakamega Forest (Mitchell, 2004) .",

Kakamega Forest is a mixture of forest and savanna elements, as is the Garamba NP (Democratic Republic of Congo), which, in contrast to Kakamega, still contains gallery forests. Kibale and Bwindi (Uganda) are situated on the Central African plateau between the western and the eastern rift valley branches. Usambara and Udzungwa forests (Tanzania) are submontane to montane. Arabuko-Sokoke (Kenya) is a comparatively dry East African coastal rain forest. Loango and Moukalaba are lowland forests on the West African coast in Gabon with, in the case of Loango, a mixture of forest, savanna, swamps and lagoons. Lop\u00e9, Monts de Crystal and Massif de Chaillu are Parks of medium altitude, also in Gabon. Ziama (Guinea) and Mount Nimba (Guinea, C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire, Liberia) forests are primary montane forests of the extreme western equatorial rain forest block. Together, all these forests contain a total (as referenced below) of 12 turtle, 124 lizard and 171 snake species.",

Under ideal conditions, when faunas are known completely, this technique produces dendrograms that link sites on the basis of shared species. PAE resembles cladistic phylogenetic analysis, except that the operational taxonomic units are geographic areas rather than taxa, and the characters used in PAE are species distributions. The character state for each species distribution is either present or absent. Shared presence of species provides evidence of biogeographic affinity between different sites, and is used to produce a hierarchical pattern of endemism. Dendrograms resulting from PAE might demonstrate historical relationships among the faunas. However, linkage between sites might simply reflect shared environmental conditions that result in colonization by similar faunas.",

Snake species associated Loveridge (1940) considered it a subspecies of P. sibilans. All authors did not consider the condition of an entire vs. divided cloacal scale as a specific diagnostic character. However, there are more characters that separate the rain forest Psammophis phillipsi from the larger savanna species P. mossambicus, e.g. the lack of a juvenile colour pattern and a dark ventral pigmentation (see also B\u00f6hme et al., 1996; Brandst\u00e4tter, 1996) . Our voucher specimen (ZFMK 82050) has 17 scale rows around midbody, 173 ventral scales, 95 paired subcaudal scales and an entire cloacal scale. A colour pattern is lacking, but there are two fine spots on each ventral scale forming two fine longitudinal lines on the venter. with secondary forests, clearings and forest edges which are also known to occur in primary forest were as numerous as typical primary forest species (see above) and represented also 39% of species; these are Typhlops angolensis, T. lineolatus, Crotaphopeltis hotamboeia, Dasypeltis atra, D. scabra, Dispholidus typus, Mehelya capensis, Natriciteres olivacea, Thrasops jacksoni, Polemon christyi, Dendroaspis jamesoni kaimosae, Elapsoidea loveridgei, Causus resimus and Bitis gabonica. Some of these taxa, e.g. Dasypeltis scabra, Dispholidus typus and Crotaphopeltis hotamboeia, are pan-African savanna species, but were recorded from secondary forest during this study.",

This conclusion is reinforced when comparing its species numbers with the respective reptile species richness of Mt Nlonako (Herrmann et al., 2005) , Korup National Park or of the Virunga Mountains (Hamilton, 1988) , which probably provided relatively stable ecological conditions even in the Pleistocene. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the Kakamega Forest and the more elevated Nandi Forests ever had any faunal exchange with either the Kenyan montane forests or the Eastern Arc Mountains. Burgess et al. (1998) suggest that the coastal and eastern montane forests have been separated from the forest block for the last 10 Myr. However, a relationship between Kakamega Forest and the coastal forests does exist, and a forest 'bridge' through the southern Kenyan highlands may have connected them, allowing an exchange of forest taxa. This is supported by Wilfert et al.'s (2006) work on the damp-wood termite Schedorhinotermes lamanianus (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae). But Arabuko-Sokoke and Kakamega forests only share typical savanna/forest dwellers such as Acanthocercus atricollis, Dispholidus typus and Naja melanoleuca. This indicates that either this bridge was not in place for long enough to allow for the migration of typical forest species, or the bridge consisted of a savanna/forest mosaic, and thus was too dry to allow typical forest animals to cross it.",

            "text": "The phylogenetic study of the genus Rhampholeon by Matthee et al. (2004) , however, does provide evidence for a formerly closed pancontinental rain forest block because the sister taxon of the West and Central African R. spectrum is not Matthee et al. (2004) , the nearest relatives of R. boulengeri inhabit the forested southern foothills of the Albertine Rift, which indicates that their ancestors dispersed along a forested corridor through the Albertine Rift (see also Burgess et al., 1998) . Since members of Rhampholeon are essentially forest animals with low migration/dispersal rates, such a bridge appears more likely than a northern bridge through the Kenyan highlands. The closed pan-African Guineo-Congolian rain forest block dates back, according to Burgess et al. (1998) , from 40 to 19 Myr bp (Oligocene to early Miocene) when a moist, tropical climate predominated (Axelrod & Raven, 1978) . Around 18 to 17 Myr bp the northward drift of the African plate led to the closing of the Tethys Sea. The climate became drastically drier and the rift formations in East Africa started to rise. At this time the pan-African forest block was divided into western (Guinea to Cameroon), central (Congo to Kenya) and eastern (East African coastal forests) isolates (Axelrod & Raven, 1978) , which were further subdivided and fragmented by climate oscillations. During favourable climatic periods, 9 to 6.4 Myr bp and again 4.6 to 2.43 Myr bp, the pan-African forest block may have been temporarily restored (Lovett, 1993a; b) . It is not clear to what extent the coastal forests were connected with the forest relicts on the Eastern Arc Mountains (e.g. Usambara). According to Brenan (1978) and Lovett & Friis (1996) , the Eastern Arc Mountains harbour a primitive flora that was more widely distributed in the past and which today cannot be found elsewhere in Africa; this argues for a long history of isolation of these montane habitats. However, the existence of a closed pan-African rain forest system throughout the climate oscillations of the Pleistocene and the Holocene seems an unlikely possibility.",

The West African block is divided into the Gold Coast, West African and Gabonian blocks, while the East African block appears undivided. This phenomenon might be explained by the comparatively close geographical distances of the East African forests investigated, which may therefore connect more rapidly, given respective climatic conditions, and thus facilitate exchange of forest species. On the other hand, the East African coastal forests and the Arc Mountains form units which differ distinctly from the Guineo-Congolian block.",

This indicates a former connection between the Guineo-Congolian forest and Eastern Arc Mountains. This connection must, of course, be much older than the last connection between Kakamega Forest and the Guineo-Congolian forest block (as it currently exists) and might not have existed during the Pleistocene. Otherwise, the high rate of endemism in the isolated Eastern Arc Mountains would be difficult to explain. According to",
