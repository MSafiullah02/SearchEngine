The purpose of the present paper was to carry out a retrospective study of the clinical and demographic data of SARS patients with diarrhea in Princess Margaret Hospital. Methods: From 1 to 31 March 2003, hospital records from 240 patients with confirmed SARS were studied. Patients with watery stool of \u22653 times/day for at least 3 consecutive days were defined as the diarrhea group. Clinical and demographic data were compared between the diarrhea and non-diarrhea groups. Chest X-ray (CXR) scores during the peak of diarrhea period were recorded by a respiratory physician. These CXR scores were correlated with the peak frequency of diarrhea by Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: Diarrhea occurred in 20.4% of patients after admission. Female patients were predominant with a female to male ratio of 6:1 (P < 0.001) and 69.4% of patients were living in Amoy Gardens Estate (P = 0.01). The proportions of patients requiring ventilatory care and mortality in the diarrhea group were 8.2% and 2%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the non-diarrhea group (27.6% and 16.2%, P < 0.005).

Fever and influenza-like symptoms were the predominant presenting features but diarrhea, nausea and vomiting were frequently observed. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Diarrhea was an important problem because SARS coronavirus could be identified in stool in up to 100% of cases on day 10 in one study, 5 and up to 70 days after onset of symptoms in another study. 7 Although stool culture for SARS coronavirus failed, 7 the possibility of oral-fecal transmission became imminent. 8 Amoy Gar-dens was one of the most densely populated private housing estates in Hong Kong and in March 2003, 321 residents from 15 blocks had contracted the disease. The source was traced to a 33-year-old patient with watery diarrhea and it was postulated that the virus was spread via a faulty sewage system. 8 Recently, coronavirus protein was identified in the esophagus, stomach and small intestines by immunohistochemical staining 9 and in colon by culture and electron microscopy, 7 suggesting a high intestinal tropism of the SARS coronavirus. Recently coronavirus-related proteins or toxins were postulated to be the cause of diarrhea. 7 In Hong Kong, the Medical and Geriatric Unit of Princess Margaret Hospital was the quarantine hospital taking care of SARS patients and by 26 May 2003, we had treated 578 patients. The present study was conducted to study the clinical and demographic data of SARS patients with diarrhea in a retrospective manner. From 1 31 March 2003, consecutive case records of patients with confirmed SARS who were admitted to Department of Medicine and Geriatrics, Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong were retrieved. The diagnosis of SARS was based on fever above the temperature of 38\u221eC, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography (CXR) or high-resolution computed tomography (CT) thorax in the absence of an alternative diagnosis to explain the clinical presentation. 10 In addition, there must be laboratory evidence of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection by either positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test 11 in stool or nasopharyngeal aspirates, or fourfold increase in antibody titer to coronavirus upon follow up. All patients were treated with clarithromycin (Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA) 500 mg b.d. for 2 weeks, amoxicillin/clavulanate (GlaxoSmith-Kline, UK) in intravenous or oral form for 2 weeks, ribavirin (Schering Plough, NJ, USA) 400-800 mg intravenously every 8 h and hydrocortisone (Pfizer, NY, USA) 100-200 mg intravenously every 6 h or prednisolone (Clonmel Healthcare, Ireland) 1 mg/kg orally. Pulse methylprednisolone (Pharmacia) 0.5-1 g per day was given for 1-6 days when patients developed respiratory distress, oxygen desaturation or progression in CXR. Patient data, need of ventilatory care, survival, number of bowel movements per day, total potassium supplement, lowest serum potassium and lowest serum albumin level were retrieved from the records and entered into a database for further analysis. The time of onset of symptoms was recorded and bowel habits before admission were recalled. The intake and output chart of these patients were carefully studied. Those patients with watery or loose stool at least three times a day for at least 3 consecutive days were defined as diarrhea patients and selected for further study. Stool tests for pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella and Clostridium difficile infection were reported. Symptomatic treatment of diarrhea with hyoscine methobromide (Synco, Hong Kong), diphenoxylate/atropine sulfate (Pharmacia) and kaopectate (Universal Pharmaceutical, Hong Kong) were also recorded. Pneumonia was scored by a respiratory physician (WLT) according to the scoring system proposed by So et al. 12 All chest radiographs were semiquantified by separating each lung into six sections (upper, middle, and lower zones and medial and lateral divisions) and scoring them on a four-point scale: 0, clear; 1, subtle haziness or mild infiltrates; 2, ground-glass appearance or prominent infiltrates; and 3, confluent or dense opacities. The maximum score would be 36. The CXR scores at the time of maximum frequency of diarrhea were then correlated with maximum frequency of bowel movements to look for an association. Data between patients with diarrhea and patients without diarrhea were compared. Bowel habits were assessed during follow up 3 weeks and 3 months after discharge from hospital.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 193, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 422, "end": 425, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 426, "end": 429, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 430, "end": 433, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 434, "end": 437, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 438, "end": 441, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 577, "end": 578, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 639, "end": 640, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 755, "end": 756, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1067, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1193, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1244, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1401, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1725, "text": "From 1 31", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2198, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 4039, "end": 4041, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 1 SD.
