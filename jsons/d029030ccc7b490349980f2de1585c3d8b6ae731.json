Methods: Seven COVID-19 patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical Collage were enrolled. All patients underwent initial and follow-up chest HRCT. The main CT features and semi-quantitative score which represent disease severity among different clinical types were evaluated. Result: On initial CT, the main abnormalities observed in common and severe cases respectively were pure ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidation surrounded by GGOs. Critical cases had multiple consolidation surrounded by wide range of GGOs distributed in the whole lung fields. The scope and density score in common (4.5 and 5), severe (9.5 and 9.5) and critical (19 and 12) cases were increased by gradient. On follow-up CT, common and severe types manifested as decreasing density of lesion, absorbed consolidation and GGOs. Critical cases showed progression of the disease. The extent and progression scores in common and severe patients were significantly decreased, while the range score of patients with critical disease reached the highest points, accompanied with an increase in the density score. Conclusion: CT scanning can accurately assess the severity of COVID-19, and help to monitor disease transformation during follow-up among different clinical conditions.",

            "text": "In late December 2019, a pneumonia of unknown cause occurred as an outbreak in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, with clinical symptoms similar to viral pneumonia including fever, cough, and dyspnea [1] . A previously unknown novel virus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with a characteristic crown morphology at electron microscopy scanning was identified as the source of this disease [2] . Subsequently, the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was official termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020 [3] . As of March 13, 2020, a total of 81,003 patients with confirmed COVID-19, including 3181 deaths, have been reported in China [4] . From current knowledge of the cases, most patients with mild and common symptoms have a relatively good prognosis while cases of death are more frequently seen in severe and critical patients, which could progress to severe pneumonia, ARDS and multiple organ failures leading to higher mortality [5e7] . Early diagnosis and accurate staging, therefore, are essential in COVID-19 patients. Viral nucleic acid detection remains the golden standard in diagnosis of COVID-19 regardless of clinical signs and symptoms, and is also the effective method to screening asymptomatic infection patients. Throat swabs tested by realtime reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used method [8] . However, previous studies have shown that several defects may limit the clinical application of laboratory tests, including immaturity of the nucleic acid detection technology, variation in detection rate from different manufacturers, disagreements in interlaboratory consultation caused by low patient viral load or improper clinical sampling [8, 9] . In addition, nucleic acid detection cannot accurately determine the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients.",

The main CT appearances of COVID-19 include ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidations, which have respectively been regarded as a marker of early and progression stage of disease [11] . Based on the abovementioned image abnormalities, HRCT could provide supplementary information Q1 to improve the planning of treatment, and evaluate the variations of image. To the best of our knowledge, little literature focuses on the change of CT appearances among different clinical types during the course of medical treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the discrepancy of series CT manifestations in COVID-19 among different clinical types within the shortterm follow-up periods, aiming to help clinicians monitor and predict outcome and to make more accurate and effective clinical decisions.",

The extent score was assessed according to the extent of lesion distributed on the five lung lobes, and the density score was evaluated based on the percentages of GGO and consolidation in each COVID-19 lesion. Thus, the score range for both lungs in each patient is from 0 (no detectable abnormality) to 20 (more than 75% of each lung lobe involved by COVID-19 lesion and 100% of consolidation in each lesion).",

            "text": "Our study found that the initial CT appearances vary according to the clinical type; this is consistent with previous reports [16e18]. The discrepancies of CT finding among different clinical types could be explained as the CT abnormalities might respectively reflect the potential pathological abnormalities in different stages of the disease. Seen mainly in the early and decaying stages of the disease, GGOs might be associated with the pathological small amount of exudation of fluid in alveolar cavity and interlobular interstitial edema [19] . As a marker of more severe phase, consolidation could reflect the pathological features of a large amount of cell-rich or fibrous exudation accumulated in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitium [20] . Additionally, the extent of GGO and consolidation in severe and critical were greater than that of common cases. Similarly, severe and critical cases tend to have higher extent and density scores compared with common type patients by semi-quantitative score system. Therefore, CT findings could accurately evaluate the severity of disease with different clinical types, and provide evidence for the further management. Fig. 3 . Initial and follow-up HRCT of critical case. A 60-year old man with a history of long-term residence in Wuhan presented with fever and dyspnea, ultimately requiring intensive care unit admission. Initial CT (A) showed multiple patchy consolidation surrounded by a wide range of GGO in bilateral pulmonary, initial CT scope and density scores were 19 and 12 respectively. First follow-up CT (B) illustrated the density and the volume of consolidation were significantly increased. Respective first follow-up CT extent and density scores were 20 and 16. Second follow-up CT (C) showed a progression with enlargement of GGOs, and increasing volume and attenuation of consolidation. Second follow-up CT extent and density scores were 20 and 19 respectively. Fig. 4 . The extent scores among common, severe and critical cases. On initial CT, the critical type exhibited a greater scope score and showed slight elevation during follow-up CT scanning. In common and severe cases, the lesion extent significant decreased after treatment.

We found that the variation of extent and progression obtained on the follow-up CT could exist among patients with different clinical conditions. In detail, the improvement of disease could be observed in common and severe type, exhibited as total or partial resolution of GGO or consolidation, result in decreasing of scope and density scores. These changes may relate to the underlying pathological features of fibrous exudation of the alveolar cavity and the disappearance of capillary congestion in the alveolar wall, which may represent a dissipation phase of COVID-19 pneumonia [21e23]. In contrast, critical case could progress to the more severe phase of disease during the same period of followup CT, represented by enlargement of GGOs, and increasing volume and attenuation of consolidation [24e26]. Numerous GGOs might be associated with the invasion of adjacent lung tissues and spread in lung [20] . As the pathologic feature mainly including infiltration of alveolar by inflammatory cells and deposition of exudation in the airway wall accompanied by destroyed and incomplete alveolar structures, change in consolidation could indicate the continuous progress of the disease, which has been reported by previously studies [27, 28] .",
