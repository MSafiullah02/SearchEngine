Each source system transmits WNV and/or botulism related data through secure links to BioPortal using mutually agreed upon protocols. Architecturally, BioPortal is comprised of a Web portal, an internal data store, and a communication backbone. The Web portal provides the necessary user interfaces and allows users to search or query infectious disease-related data sets, visualize these data and analysis results in an intuitive spatiotemporal fashion, perform analysis tasks using built-in analytical models and functions, and identify alerts that signal the development or emergence of \"hot spots.\" HL7 standards are used as the main storage format to support the necessary data interoperability. All participating agencies transmit data to BioPortal as HL7compliant XML messages through a secured network connection. HL7 XML-based standards are more advantageous than alternative methods that demand the internal data store to consolidate and maintain the data fields in the respective data sets and sources, hereby offering greater system scalability and extensibility.

Overall, the communication backbone provides data transmission, receiving, and verification functions, together with source-specific data normalization and data security services (using robust encryption technologies). Currently, BioPortal houses several data sets, summarized in Table 1 . BioPortal includes spatial temporal visualizer (STV), an advanced visualization module that allows users to explore infectious disease data and examine query results in an intuitive and easily comprehensible manner. STV allows users to load and save spatiotemporal data dynamically for real-time information sharing or further analyses. STV supports several integrated and synchronized views that include periodic, timeline, and GIS. Periodic views enable users to identify prominent periodic temporal patterns.

We aggregated the analysis accuracy for a subject across all the experiment tasks he or she performed and used the resulting accuracy to test the hypothesized effect of technology. 2 As we show in Table 2 , our analysis demonstrated that technology has a significant effect on analysis accuracy. Specifically, the accuracy associated with BioPortal (mean = 81.94, SD = 21.23) was greater than that of the spreadsheet program (mean = 61.19, SD = 17.92), and the difference was significant at the 0.01 level. Thus, our data supported H1; i.e., the outcome accuracy resulting from the use of BioPortal would be significantly greater than that associated with the benchmark system. Task Performance Efficiency: We examined task performance efficiency using the amount of time a subject needed to complete an analysis task. As shown in Table 3 , technology has a significant effect on the amount of time a subject needed to complete a task (p-value < 0.01). On average, subjects who used BioPortal could complete a task considerably faster (mean = 36.28 minutes, SD = 11.33 minutes) than their counterparts supported by the spreadsheet program (mean = 48.23 minutes, SD = 5.07 minutes); the difference was significant at the 0.01 level. 3 Thus, our data supported H2; i.e., the amount of time a subject needs to complete an analysis task would be significantly less when using BioPortal than using the benchmark system.

As shown in Table 4 , subjects using BioPortal exhibited higher satisfaction with the information support 2 When aggregating the analysis accuracy of a subject across experimental tasks, we assigned an accuracy score of 1 to each incomplete task. Our rationale is that an incomplete analysis, from a grading perspective, is not any better than one that is completely incorrect, particularly with regard to the corresponding gold-standard solutions in the assessment. 3 For a task not completed within the specified time limit, we used 50 minutes as the time requirement.
