The coronavirus epidemic of 2019-2020, or COVID-19, is no exception, with the World Health Organization warning of a possible 'infodemic' of fake news. In this study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians. As we make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain will become an important part of quality control for public health communication and public discourse in general.",

Coinciding with the Democratic primary season in the US, the virus is often mentioned in association with political figures -both in support and in opposition. Despite Facebook's near-ubiquitous reach across the US, these ads often target very specific demographics and locales, especially favoring California, New York and Texas. Furthermore, we find a range of possible erroneous information within these ads, ranging from conspiracy theories about bioweapons, to milder claims of political mismanagement and misunderstanding. However, as the situation develops, more will be known about the veracity of some of the content we discovered. Thus, we make the full dataset, along with the manual labels, available to the research community, in accordance with the Terms of Service of Facebook.",

Although it is not clear that increased online engagement results in desired health behaviors, research in commercial sphere shows a relationship between engagement with Facebook and sales [6, 26] . To encourage engagement, public health campaigns strive for an engaging experience, as the campaigns with a clear call to action have an opportunity to quantify the impact of the message (such as signing up for future contacts), or encourage the community to propagate the message (in best scenario having it go \"viral\", i.e. very popular) [18] . To encourage wider sharing, campaigns may personalize the messages to individuals or demographic groups [35] or use highly engaged \"seed\" users who promote the content in their immediate social network [44, 22] . However, unlike in traditional advertising, sponsorships, partnerships and use of persons of authority may hurt engagement, whereas partnering with celebrities and sportspeople results in increased likes and shares [24] . This trend can be attributed to a variety of reasons: perceived credibility associated with success, social acceptance, and confirmation bias, all provide positive reinforcement for people to follow health advice of celebrities, possibly propagating harmful behaviors and beliefs [23] .",

Historically, celebrity \"health narratives\" resulted in a \"coconstruction of meaning\", allowing the audience to participate in the experience of a health event and reflect on its significance in their own lives [4] . However, many perceptions may happen subconsciously. For example, a recent study showed that children who saw influencers with unhealthy snacks had significantly increased overall food intake, with no accompanying positive response to seeing them with healthy snacks [10] . The popularization of social media and the expansion of authority and celebrity have brought informal signals about health and medicine to a vast number of internet users -to their possible detriment.",

            "text": "Early on, information available on Internet has been shown to be problematic, with a wide variability in the quality of health-related information [42, 16] . The openness and scale of social media makes it especially susceptible to harmful information, such as YouTube videos promoting tobacco to consumers [28] , Twitter posts sowing doubt about the safety of vaccination [32] , and Flickr communities \"supporting\" its members in maintaining anorexic behaviors [49] . Especially during epidemics, social media allows a rapid spread of rumors and misinformation. To track such content, a hybrid approach has been proposed wherein expert knowledge is combined with citizen science and machine learning. Such pipelines have been proposed for the 2014 Ebola [19] and 2016 Zika [14, 20, 11] outbreaks. Resources such as HealthMap 11 and AIDR 12 attempt to streamline the processing of news, social media, and medical reports to build an up-to-date model of an ongoing crisis [25, 40] . However, little has been done in understanding advertisement plays in public health communication during an epidemic. Although social media websites are attempting to apply quality control to the ads on their platforms, such as Facebook down-ranking ads mentioning \"vaccine hoaxes\" 13 , until now it has been difficult to examine the quality of information posted via such paid channels. In this study, we examine the case of the 2019-2020 coronavirus epidemic via a newly available window into advertising on the Facebook platform.",

Coding result was examined by all authors and uncertain cases were decided jointly. The most difficult distinction proved to be between news and political, as most such pages posted politically-relevant news, thus only pages representing a political figure or party were classified as political. Also note the small contribution of public health to the dataset. It is possible the Library selection criteria Facebook applies to the ads simply does not match that of most public health campaigns, and a more varied resource is necessary to fully capture them. Thus, we focus on the non-public health campaigns. Figure 2 shows the pages in a co-occurrence network such that each node is a Facebook page posting an advertisement and an edge is the Jaccard similarity between the text of all of their ads in our dataset. To clean the text, we remove URLs, special characters and stopwords, and lemmatize the remaining words. For visual clarity, we threshold Jaccard similarity at 0.05. The nodes are colored by the category of the page. We use Gephi force-directed layout ForceAtlas 2 [9] which positions nodes which are strongly connected closer together. We notice a cluster of non-profit organizations (green nodes) in lower right, which include UNICEF, Melinda Gates Foundation, and several animal rights organizations. Note that highly specialized animal rights organization United Poultry Concerns is disconnected from this group, as they use highly specific language in reference to the treatment of birds. The rest of the network shows a mixing of news (blue) and politics (green), which is expected, given most news pages are highly political. Areas of specializations are seen in the clusters of business pages (yellow) in bottom left and candidates for political office (red) in upper left, as well as two educational institutions (green and grey) in upper right. Overall, the pages Figure 2 : Network of pages, linked using Jaccard similarity of ad text at threshold 0.05.

We find the most active to be non-profit pages, followed by news, and political ads. However, the number of impressions can vary greatly between different campaigns. The volume of non-profit pages jumps especially around February 5 when the first coronavirus case is reported in US 15 . In Figure 4 we show the total expenditures (left), total impressions attained (center), and dollars per impression (center) by top pages in our dataset. As both expenditures and impressions come as ranges (such as 200-299 USD for 30,000-34,999 impressions), we take the average of min and max of each range, and sum up these averages for all ads posted by the page. Pages spending the most on their campaigns are American Medical Association (association of physicians), National Nurses United (labor union), Melinda Gates (philanthropic foundation), and Team Mike 2020 (Presidential election campaign for Michael Bloomberg). These expenditures are also associated with some of the highest audience reaches, as can be seen from the plot on the right. The advertisement with the highest expenditure is from National Nurses United, urging viewers to take a \"coronavirus preparedness survey\", asking whether their \"employers must be prepared for coronavirus\" 16 . Yet another advertisement with high viewership and cost is by American Medical Association linking to a story of a US clinic that cared for patients infected with the coronavirus 17 . We observe that most visible ads were not providing basic information about coronavirus. Combining the two measures, in Figure 4 (right) we show the dollar per impression spent. We observe that the highest such ratio reaches 700 USD per impression. This may be due to the actual numbers being closer to the lower end of the range than the average, which is what we employ.",

The resulting demographic and the geographic targeting distributions for public health, non-profit, news, politics, and business are shown in Figure 5 . Both public health and non-profit pages reach more women then men, and the latter -more women of age 65 and over. Public health campaigns, on the other hand, reach younger men. The gender is more balanced for business, political, and news, however all seem to reach older women more than men.

General preparedness is also promoted by a page 4Patriots (established on Jul 20, 2014), which encourages its audience to \"STOCK UP HERE\" 19 .",

As the page was created on Feb 6, 2020, it is possible that the account is a troll created specifically for posting content about this epidemic. A less obvious example is shown in Figure 8 (upper right), which links to an article stating ambiguously that \"there have also been suggestions that the virus may have escaped from a Peo-ple\u00e2\u0202\u0179s Liberation Army Biowarfare unit\", a claim that has been circulating on Daily Mail 23 and Washington Times 24 , and which the research lab is denying 25 . Yet less contentious, but more politicized potentially erroneous information comes from the claim by US President Donald Trump that \"as the weather starts to warm and the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone\" (see Figure 8 (lower left)). Although the claim has some grounding in the behavior of known viruses, it is still unclear how the new strain will behave 26 .

Meanwhile, we observe the myriad contexts in which the topic of coronavirus is used outside public health messaging: clear fear-mongering, political attacks, and conducting business. Although in our dataset, we find that these ads are not promoted widely by their posters, with all but one having expenditure in the range of 0-99 USD (the other being in 100-199 USD). Interestingly, the ads having possible misinformation in news and political categories have a distinct demographic targeting, as seen in Figure 9 . While news reaches age groups more evenly (except for spike for females in 55-64 age range), political ads seem to target the older generation, with highest viewership in over 65 age range. Finally, we check whether the emotional content in these advertisements is different from the rest of the dataset, and we find no statistical significance, which may indicate that misinformation indeed \"sounds\" like the rest of the content, or that we simply do not have enough data to make this assessment at this point.",

Much of information provided by the news-related ads in our dataset have echoed the latest information provided by major public health organizations such as US Center for Disease Control 30 . These include information on the latest cases, travel advisories, and steps people can take to protect themselves. Some even provide links to surveys, possibly using the advertising platform as a recruitment tool for estimating awareness (although it is possible the surveys are simply meant to attract attention). Thus, Facebook advertising may be a useful way to propagate the message through alternative sources and collect data on readership. 28 However, we find most advertising campaigns having extremely narrow targeting, especially geographically. Although our sample of public health campaigns is limited by Facebook's selection of ads to make available through the library, those that we find cover a small geographic locale. The situation is similar to ads from other categories. In fact, the targeting of public health and non-profit categories does not favor older men who have the highest mortality from COVID-19 31 . Personalized messaging has been studied in public health literature, such as for improving HIV/AIDS medication adherence [13] and smoking cessation [34, 12] , but the application of such messaging must be coordinated among the agencies to achieve a consistent message and a thorough coverage of the population. Moreover, the reach and personalization of Facebook for public health messaging can be used to reach underserved populations [33, 27] , supplementing traditional means such as physical billboards and rural outreach programs [36] .",

For instance, we find numerous mentions of coronavirus in association with US politicians, some of which are top spenders in our dataset. Unlike in, for example, China during SARS epidemic that prompted a \"renews sense of patriotism\" through narrative of self-sacrifice [30] , in the US COVID-19 seems to be adopted as a weapon in the ongoing partisan struggle, especially in a US Presidential election year. A similar weaponization of the epidemic narrative occurred in Africa during the Ebola epidemic, resulting in several deaths [47] . Although it is difficult to achieve a comprehensive political message during a crisis, the extent of panic amongst the public, as well as the stability of world markets, depends not only on public health institutions, but on the leaders who have far-reaching platforms.",

Ranging from accusations of using bioweapons to questioning correctness of comparisons to other viruses, the reasons for such content may be diverse. However, we do not find the posters of these ads to be investing much money, although some achieve up to 15,000 and more impressions. It is also concerning that, based on our sentiment analysis, these messages may \"feel\" similar to the other content about coronavirus. Unfortunately, despite Facebook's collaboration with a myriad of fact-checking institutions, it is possible that small campaigns like this are not popular enough to warrant examination. The design of fully and partially automated tools to detect early appearance of \"fake news\" and misinformation is becoming a hot research topic [1, 20, 38, 45] , but it is imperative to use them within a larger public health communication strategy, guided by subject matter experts, and enforced by both governments and social media platforms.",

In the light of new findings and developments, some of the annotations provided in this work may change. Thus, we will make the annotated dataset available to the research community 33 . Secondly, Facebook Ads Library was not created for monitoring public health messaging -this is why this study focuses on the alternative narratives. It would be extremely helpful if the social media platforms were to collaborate more closely with public health researchers, so that a full picture of the discourse may be examined. An increased worldwide coverage would also allow the tracking of pandemics across different parts of the world (recall currently the Library covers EU countries, US, and a handful of others). However, even if we were to attain information on all advertising happening on Facebook and Instagram, this will capture by far not all internet users, and only a fraction of people in the US. Internet, as well as traditional media, present a plethora of alternative communication channels, and more studies must be conducted to capture the full scope of communication related to public health, and its possible impacts.",
