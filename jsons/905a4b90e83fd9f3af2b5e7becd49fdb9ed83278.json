Factors determining severity of disease in previously healthy infants are still unclear. It was hypothesized that disease severity is correlated with viral load in primary RSV infection. Infants of a healthy birth cohort were included at signs of their first respiratory tract infection. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained within 48-96 hr and disease severity was assessed with a previously published severity scoring model. PCR was applied to test the aspirates in a semi-quantitative way for the presence of 10 respiratory pathogens. In case of multiple infection, the pathogen with the highest load was defined as the primary pathogen. The correlation between disease severity and viral load was analyzed. A total of 82 infants were included over a period of 2 years. Median age at first respiratory tract infection was 3 months. Pathogens were detected in 77 (94%) infants; more than one pathogen was detected in 35 (43%) infants. RSV was present in aspirates of 30 infants; in 16 aspirates RSV was the primary pathogen. A negative correlation between RSV CT-value and disease severity was found in all RSV cases (r \u00bc \u00c00.52, P \u00bc 0.003) and in cases with RSV as the primary pathogen (r \u00bc \u00c00.54, P \u00bc 0.03). In conclusion, this is the first report on viral loads in previously healthy infants with RSV infection in the community. Disease severity correlated positively with viral load during primary RSV infection.",

Previous studies in infants treated in hospital disagree on the association between viral load in the nasopharynx and disease severity [Buckingham et al., 2000; Wright et al., 2002; Legg et al., 2003; DeVincenzo et al., 2005; Fodha et al., 2007] . Since the populations in these studies were very heterogeneous, and none of these studies did take into account possible co-infections, the level of evidence is limited. Analysis of RSV infection in the community in a healthy birth cohort is relevant, because of the high incidence resulting in a large impact on public health, and because it reveals mechanisms of pathogenesis that potentially apply to infants admitted to hospital. The current study is the first to investigate the correlation between viral load and disease severity during primary RSV infections in the community in previously healthy infants. We hypothesize that higher viral load leads to more severe disease.",

Studies that did not find this relation may have been confounded by the presence of risk factors such as cardiopulmonary disease, by RSV immunization, or by the occurrence of co-infections, since none of the beforementioned studies considered co-pathogens during RSV infection [Wright et al., 2002; Legg et al., 2003 ]. In the current study, two or more pathogens were found in 43% of the first respiratory tract infections in previously healthy children, strongly suggesting asymptomatic acquisition of respiratory viruses in early infancy. However, the possibility that a previous mild respiratory tract infection was not noticed by the parents or not reported to the researchers cannot be excluded. The correlation between disease severity and viral load was highest in case of single RSV infection and was absent in RSV co-infections. Infants with RSV as the primary pathogen infection were more severely ill. Rhinovirus disease severity was not correlated to viral load or the presence of co-infections.
