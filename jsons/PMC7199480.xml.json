            "text": "Gastrointestinal (GI) disease is common in equine neonates. Foals presented for abdominal pain or diarrhoea may be easily identified as suffering from GI disease. However, neonates with other clinical presentations, such as sepsis, prematurity or perinatal asphyxia syndrome, may show nonspecific signs, with GI disease being one of many components of the process. Furthermore, clinical and clinicopathological signs overlap between these other disease conditions. Case management varies between various diseases and prognoses differ. Abdominal ultrasonography has proved useful in the assessment of human and veterinary cases with different conditions. In human critical care units, the time from presentation to operative care, length of hospitalisation, complications and cost decrease when abdominal sonograms are performed during emergency evaluations, potentially due to a more rapid diagnosis (Levy and Noble 2008). In paediatric colitis (Baud et al. 2004) and GI emergencies (Puylaert 2001; Pastore et al. 2007) sonographic findings correlate with anatomical distribution of the disease or diagnosis and often help patient management. Abdominal ultrasonography is well described in equine neonates (Reef 1998; McAuliffe 2004; Reef 2004; Porter and Ramirez 2005); however, studies that quantify its usefulness, accuracy and limitations are scarce.",

Necrotising enterocolitis occurs frequently in human newborn intensive care units (Babcock 2002; Thompson and Bizzarro 2008), primarily in premature neonates (Lee and Polin 2003; Obladen 2009). Necrotising enterocolitis has been described in foals in isolated case reports (Cudd and Pauly 1987; Yager 1987; Jones et al. 1988; East et al. 1998) and several texts have suggested that it may be an under recognised syndrome (Slovis 2003; Magdesian 2005; Vaala 2009; Wilkins 2010). The diagnosis of NEC in human infants is based on clinical and imaging findings. The presence of intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis, PI) is considered virtually pathognomonic for necrotising enterocolitis in neonates with a compatible clinical picture (Walsh and Kliegman 1986; St. Peter et al. 2003; Epelman et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2007). Radiographic documentation of PI is the current standard to confirm NEC diagnosis in man, but the sonographic detection of PI has been shown to be both sensitive and specific (Kim et al. 2007) and to have a growing and evolving role in the evaluation of these patients (Epelman et al. 2007).",

We hypothesised that the sonographic signs in foals with GI disease are varied but there is a subgroup of neonates with characteristic sonographic findings (including PI) and a clinical presentation suggestive of a necrotising component of the GI disease.

PI was identified when hyperechoic echoes casting a dirty shadow were imaged within the bowel wall consistent with intramural gas (Fig 1 and Supporting information). Abnormalities in bowel wall echogenicity were areas of increased, decreased or heterogeneous echogenicity within the intestinal wall (Fig 2). Functional abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract were defined as abnormalities in the contents or motility of the affected portion of the GI tract. Motility was considered normal if there were frequent, rhythmic peristaltic waves. Subjectively increased, decreased or arrhythmic contractions were considered abnormal. The stomach was not evaluated for motility disorders. Ileus was defined as diffuse hypomotility and distension of the gastrointestinal viscera (Fig 3). Abnormal peritoneal fluid was defined as fluid that is hypoechoic to echoic or increased in amount (Reef 2004; Porter and Ramirez 2005) (Fig 4). The presence of focally abnormal peritoneal fluid (vs. diffusely) was analysed as a separate variable.",

Different patterns of abnormal intestinal echogenicity, based on the loss/maintenance of stratification and folding, have been shown to help define the GI disease process in children with colitis (Baud et al. 2004). In this series of cases abnormalities in the GI wall, echogenicity was frequently associated with the diagnosis of necrotising GI disease. However, we did not analyse changes in wall layering and the lack of definitive diagnosis in many cases would have made pathological correlations difficult.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the sonographic detection of PI in foals and evaluation of its prognostic value. The sonographic appearance of PI in the equine neonates was most frequently that of scattered hyperechoic foci, although clustered foci were imaged in some instances. Detailed images using high frequency transducers allow for the differentiation between intraluminal and intramural gas, for detection of small amounts of intramural gas and for determining the extent of the PI. The pattern or extent of PI does not correlate with the severity of the symptoms in clinical NEC in human neonates (St. Peter et al. 2003), but it did in an experimental model in rabbits (Kim et al. 2007). We did not attempt to describe a pattern of PI nor to quantify or grade the severity of the PI in our foals because of the retrospective nature of the study. Intramural gas may involve any part of the GI tract in human NEC but is more commonly present in the distal small bowel and large bowel and imaged more commonly in the right lower quadrant (Kim et al. 2007). In our study, the intramural gas was imaged more frequently in the small intestine than in the large intestine and was detected infrequently in both small and large intestine.",

Wall ischaemia is the final pathway and not the primary initiator of the PI (Lee and Polin 2003; Thompson and Bizzarro 2008). Prematurity is the only independent determinant of human NEC (Lee and Polin 2003), and prematurity and dystocia (Cudd and Pauly 1987) have been suggested to be associated with NEC in foals. In this retrospective study, there was a difference (P = 0.03, OR 5.1) in the presence of NEC between premature (7/13, 53.8%) and term (6/32 18.75%) foals. However, the actual breeding date was seldom recorded in the medical record, and also conclusions should be drawn with caution. Even though in this group premature foals were more likely to develop necrotising disease (5.1 times more likely as determined by the OR), foals analogous to premature very low birthweight children are not frequent.

Respiratory distress syndrome or congenital heart disease has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of NEC in human neonates by causing hypoxic mucosal injury (Guner et al. 2008). We tested the association between respiratory disease, arterial blood gases values and congenital heart disease with the presence of necrotising gastrointestinal disease and no association was found. The number of neonates with congenital heart disease in this series was small (n = 3) and therefore the lack of association could be due to lack of statistical power. Bacteraemia has been documented in up to 35% of NEC cases in children (Lee and Polin 2003) and some authors have hypothesised that NEC is a contagious disease, implicating Klebsiella, E. coli, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Pseudomona, Clostridia, Staphylococci, coronavirus, rotavirus or enterovirus (Walsh and Kliegman 1986). There are reports associating C. difficile (Jones et al. 1988), C. perfringens (East et al. 1998) and Rhodococcus equi (Yager 1987) with NEC in foals.

Sonographic findings match the pathological stages and may precede clinical signs (Faingold et al. 2005; Epelman et al. 2007). The hallmark pathological finding of NEC is ischaemic or coagulative necrosis, which is characterised by full thickness necrosis, paucity of acute inflammatory cells (neutrophils) and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate (Guner et al. 2008). In our group, it was not possible to stage the disease as there were not enough serial scans performed to assess the sonographic progression. The sonographic and pathological or surgical findings were well correlated in 3 individuals that had both an abdominal ultrasound examination and surgery/necropsy. Detailed complete evaluation of the GI tract histologically may be necessary to detect focal regions of necrosis. This may be the reason for the lack of detection of a necrotising component in the pathological examination of 2 of the cases in this series. In these 2 foals in which histopathology did not find evidence of necrosis only a few areas of PI were seen sonographically, which would have been difficult to find at post mortem without guiding the pathologist to the area of interest.",

Rotating the transducer, changing subject position and the use of higher frequency transducers with excellent resolution help in distinguishing PI from artefacts (pseudopneumatosis intestinalis) (Kim et al. 2005, 2007). Only subjects in which the hyperechoic echoes of gas were confidently imaged within the wall were classified as having PI in this study. Statistical analysis of the correlation between sonographic and histological changes was not performed owing to the small number of cases that had both.",

Therefore, a prospective study assessing the maturity of the foal, the feeding practices, clinical findings, clinicopathological findings, ultrasonographic findings and the results of surgical intervention should be performed to further study this disease affecting neonatal foals. Prospective examination of tissue samples from foals with sonographically diagnosed PI is indicated to further study the association between sonographic PI and pathological necrotising GI disease. The sonographic evaluation of the neonatal intestine should include colour Doppler assessment of intestinal blood flow, as submucosal blood flow characterisation using colour Doppler sonography correlates well with histology and outcome and allows differentiation of focal from diffuse necrosis in human neonates (Faingold et al. 2005). Normal descriptions of the sonographic appearance of the neonatal GI tract, including measurements of wall thicknesses and assessment of intestinal blood flow, also need to be obtained.",
