            "text": "The lymphatic system was fi rst recognised by Gaspare Aselli in 1627, and the anatomy of the lymphatic system was almost completely characterised by the early nineteenth century. However, knowledge of the blood circulation continued to grow rapidly in the last century [ 1 ] . Two different theories are proposed which are in favour of origin of the lymphatic vessels. Firstly, centrifugal theory of embryologic origin of the lymphatics was described in the early twentieth century by Sabin and later by Lewis, postulating that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are derived from the venous endothelium. Later the centripetal theory of lymphatic development was proposed by Huntington and McClure in 1910 which describes the development of the lymphatic system beginning with lymphangioblasts, mesenchymal progenitor cells, arising independently of veins. The venous connection to the lymphatic system then happens later in development [ 2 ] .",

            "text": "The lymphatic system consists of the lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, Peyer's patches and tonsils, which play important roles in immune surveillance and response. The lymphatic system serves as the body's second vascular system in vertebrates and functions co-dependently with the cardiovascular system [ 9 , 10 ] . The lymphatic system comprises a single irreversible, open-ended transit network without a principal driving force [ 9 ] . It consists of fi ve main types of conduits including the capillaries, collecting vessels, lymph nodes, trunks and ducts. The lymphatic system originates in the dermis with initial lymphatic vessels and blind-ended lymphatic capillaries that are nearly equivalent in size to but less abundant than regular capillaries [ 9 , 11 ] . Lymphatic capillaries consist of a single layer of thin-walled, non-fenestrated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), alike to blood capillaries. The LECs, on the contrary to blood vessels, have poorly developed basement membrane and lack tight junctions and adherent junctions too. These very porous capillaries act as gateway for large particles, cells and interstitial fl uid. Particles as large as 100 nm in diameter can extravasate into the interstitial space, get phagocytosed by macrophages and are ultimately passed on to lymph nodes [ 11 -14 ] . Lymphatic capillary endothelial cells are affi xed to the extracellular matrix by elastic anchoring fi laments, which check vessel collapse under high interstitial pressure. These initial lymphatics, under a positive pressure gradient, distend and create an opening between loosely anchored endothelial cells letting for the entry of lymph, a protein-rich exudate from the blood capillaries [ 12 , 15 , 16 ] . In initial lymphatic vessels, overlying endothelial cell-cell contacts prevent fl uid refl ux back into the interstitial space [ 17 , 18 ] .",

Lymph is received from the initial capillary lymphatic by deeper collecting vessels that contain valves to maintain unidirectional fl ow of lymph. These collecting vessels have basement membranes and are surrounded by smooth muscle cells with intrinsic contractile activity that in combination with contraction of surrounding skeletal muscles and arterial pulsations propels the lymph to lymph nodes [ 19 -21 ] . The collecting lymphatic vessels unite into lymphatic trunks, and the lymph is fi nally returned to the venous circulation via the thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein [ 22 , 23 ] . The fl ow of lymph toward the circulatory system is supported by increases in interstitial pressure as well as contractions of the lymphatic vessels themselves.

Lymphatics transport the antigen-presenting cells as well as antigens from the interstitium of peripheral tissues to the draining lymph nodes where they initiate immune responses via B-and T-cells in the lymph nodes [ 9 , 12 , 24 , 25 ] . Tissue fl uid balance is maintained by restoring interstitial fl uid to the cardiovascular system [ 9 ] . Although capillaries have very low permeability to proteins, these molecules as well as other macromolecules and bacteria accumulate in the interstitium. Due to the accumulation of these large molecules in the interstitium, signifi cant tissue oedema would result. The lymphatic system offers the mechanism by which these large molecules re-enter the blood circulation [ 26 ]. The lymphatic system is the site of many diseases such as metastitial tuberculosis (TB), cancer and fi lariasis [ 27 ] . Due to the peculiar nature and anatomy of the lymphatic system, localisation of drugs in the lymphatics has been particularly diffi cult to achieve.",

            "text": "The lymphatic system has an active role in cancer metastasis. Although many cancers may be treated with surgical resection, microscopic disease may remain and lead to locoregional recurrence. Conventional systemic chemotherapy cannot prove effective for delivering drugs to the lymphatic system without dose-limiting toxicities [ 28 ]. Lymphatic system functions in the clearance of particulate matter from the interstitium following presentation to lymph nodes have created interest in developing microparticulate systems to target regional lymph nodes. Molecule's composition is important in determining uptake into the lymphatics and retention within the lymph nodes. Colloidal materials, for example, liposomes, activated carbon particles, emulsions, lipids and polymeric particulates, are highly taken up by the lymphatics; that's why nowadays these substances are emerging as potential carriers for lymphatic drug targeting [ 29 ] . The vast majority of drugs following oral administration are absorbed directly into portal blood, but a number of lipophilic molecules may get access to the systemic circulation via the lymphatic pathway [ 30 , 31 ] . Intestinal lymphatic transport of lipophilic molecules is signifi cant and presents benefi ts in a number of situations: The lymphatic system also acts as the primary systemic transport pathway for B-and T-lymphocytes as well as the main route of metastatic spread of a number of solid tumours [ 36 , 37 ] . Therefore, lymphatic absorption of the immunomodulatory and anticancer compounds may be more effective [ 38 , 39 ] . The presence of wide amounts of HIV-susceptible immune cells in the lymphoid organs makes antiretroviral drug targeting to these sites of tremendous interest in HIV therapy. This strategy comprises once again targeting nanosystems to immune cell populations, particularly macrophages. Also evidence further suggests that lymph and lymphoid tissue, and in particular gut-associated lymphoid tissue, play a major role in the development of HIV and antivirals which target acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS) may therefore be more effective when absorbed via the intestinal lymphatics [ 40 , 41 ] Targeting drugs to lymphatic system is a tough and challenging task, and it totally depends upon the intricate physiology of the lymphatic system. Targeting facilitates direct contact of drug with the specifi c site, decreasing the dose of the drugs and minimising the side effects caused by them. Currently, nanocarriers have encouraged the lymphatic targeting, but still there are challenges of locating drugs and bioactives to specifi c sites, maintaining desired action and crossing all the physiological barriers. These hurdles could be overcome by the use of modifi ed nanosystems achieved by the surface engineering phenomena.",

In anthrax infection, endospores from Bacillus anthracis that gain access into the body are phagocytosed by macrophages and carried to regional lymph nodes where the endospores germinate inside the macrophages and become vegetative bacteria [ 58 ] . According to one literature, computed tomography of the chest was performed on eight patients infected with inhalational anthrax. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was found in seven of the eight patients [ 59 ] . In another case report of a patient, the anthrax bacillus was shown to be rapidly sterilised within the blood stream after initiation of antibiotic therapy. However, viable anthrax bacteria were still present in postmortem mediastinal lymph node specimens [ 60 ] . Treatment and control of these diseases are hard to accomplish because of the limited access of drugs to mediastinal nodes using common pathways of drug delivery. Also, the anatomical location of mediastinal nodes represents a diffi cult target for external beam irradiation.",

For oral delivery of drug-encapsulated liposomal formulations, intestinal absorbability and stability are the primary formulation concerns. Ling et al. evaluated oral delivery of a poorly bioavailable hydrophilic drug, cefotaxime, in three different forms: liposomal formulation, aqueous-free drug and a physical mixture of the drug and empty liposomes [ 75 ] . The liposomal formulation of the drug turned out to exhibit a 2.7-fold increase in its oral bioavailability compared to the aqueous dosage and a 2.3-fold increase for the physical mixture. They also accounted that the liposomal formulation leads to a signifi cant enhancement of the lymphatic localisation of the drug relative to the other two formulations. As a result, liposome systems emerged as useful carriers for poorly bioavailable hydrophilic drugs, promoting their lymphatic transport in the intestinal lymph as well as their systemic bioavailability.",

Size and molecular structure play a great role in distribution and pharmacokinetics of dendrimers. For example, PAMAM-G8 when injected intravenously had a comparatively long life in the circulatory system with minimum leakage out of the vessels, whereas PAMAM-G4 cleared rapidly from the systemic circulation due to rapid renal clearance but had immediate survival in lymphatic circulation. The smaller-sized DAB-G5 showed greater accumulation and retention in lymph nodes useful for lymph node imaging using MR-LG. Gadomer-17 and Gd-DTPAdimeglumine (Magnevist) were evaluated as controls. Imaging experiments revealed that all of the reagents are able to visualise the deep lymphatic system except Gd-DTPA-dimeglumine. To visualise the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, PAMAM-G8 and DAB-G5 were used, respectively. While PAMAM-G4 provided good contrast of both the nodes and connecting vessels, Gadomer-17 was able to visualise lymph nodes, but not as clear as Gd-based dendrimers.

The delivery of novel carriers to lymph nodes for therapeutic purposes has much promise. Giving importance to the lymphatic route in metastasis, this delivery system may have great potential for targeted delivery of various therapeutic agents to tumours and their metastatic lymph nodes. Various delivery systems have been discussed here but colloidal carriers, especially, liposomes have been the carrier of choice to date. The purpose of this review is to provide an improved and effective lymphotropic system with a satisfactory quality for clinical use and to establish a preparation method applicable for industrial production. Surface-engineered lymphotropic systems may prove as an effective carrier for anti-HIV, anticancer and oral vaccine delivery in near future. 3.",
