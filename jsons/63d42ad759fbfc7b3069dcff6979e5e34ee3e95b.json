Currently, a limited amount of prophylactic or 23 therapeutic intervention options are available against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we screened 400 24 compounds from the antimicrobial 'Pandemic Response Box' library for inhibiting properties against 25 SARS-CoV-2. We identified sixteen compounds that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, of 26 which five compounds displayed equal or even higher antiviral activity compared to Remdesivir. These 27 results show that five compounds should be further investigated for their mode of action, safety and 28 efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.",
