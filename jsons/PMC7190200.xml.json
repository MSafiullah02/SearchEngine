In December 2019, a cluster of patients with severe pneumonia of unknown etiology, epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) led to the discovery of a novel, previously unknown coronavirus, initially designated 2019-nCoV: this agent represents the seventh member of the coronaviridae family that has the potential to infect humans [3]. Since its emergence in Wuhan, despite strong restrictions to limit domestic people circulation, the 2019-nCoV infection has rapidly spread across China and all over the world. This highly contagious and deadly virus was subsequently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4] and the related disease \u201cCoronavirus Disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19) [5]. On March 11th 2020, COVID-19 was pronounced as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) [6]. As of April 7, 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 1.250.000 worldwide (more than 180 countries involved), with 69.210 deaths resulting in a crude fatality rate of 5.5% at time of writing [7].",

Although children seem to have less severe clinical symptoms when infected [8], the potential harm of this novel disease remains largely unknown in neonates, especially in preterm infants. In the largest pediatric population-based study to date with 2143 cases, over 90% ranged from asymptomatic to moderate. However, the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10.6% under 1 year of age, compared to 7.3, 4.2, 4.1 and 3.0% among the 1\u20135, 6\u201310, 11\u201315 and > 15 year subsets, suggesting that infants may be at higher risk of severe respiratory failure than initially thought [9].

Neither bat- nor pangolin-coronaviruses sampled thus far have the polybasic sites characterizing SARS-CoV-2, and none have enough similarity to qualify as its direct progenitor, but the diversity of coronaviruses in animal species is largely undersampled and scarsely explored [10]). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 might have acquired its genomic features by evolutionary mutation in an animal reservoir and passed to human from droppings, contaminated food material or other in the market or surrounding regions of Wuhan. Alternatively, a more distant progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 might have passed to human and gradually acquired its pathogenic features through adaptation during successive, undetected human-to-human transmissions.",

Children are not generally protected from viral infections, which instead are very frequent from infancy onwards. Otto et al. showed that children who had received combined diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB and poliomyelitis vaccination within the third month of life had significantly less symptomatic infections than those with delayed or partial immunizations, maybe because of an vaccination-associated unspecific enhancement of immunological activity (e.g. interleukin 2 mediated) or other factors still unknown [17]. A thorough understanding of the virus-host innate interactions during common respiratory infections of childhood (coronaviruses, rhinoviruses,, pneumoviruses (respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus) and ortho/paramyxoviruses (influenza, parainfluenza), all characterized by an RNA genome, will be pivotal to understand these findings [18].",

ACE2 represents a major gateway to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the specific mechanisms are still uncertain. As with other coronaviruses, the N-terminal portion (S1, receptor binding domain) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds with high-affinity to receptor(s) on the surface of susceptible cells. Although ACE2 has been identified as a viral receptor, there might be other receptors or co-receptors for this virus yet to be discovered [19]. It is possible that ACE2 tissue distribution differs between adults and children and the maturity and function (e.g., binding ability) of ACE2 in children may be lower than that in adults [9].",

The authors conclude that despite uncertainty, so high IgM levels at 2 h of life would suggest an intrauterine infection. However, as Kimberlin and Stagno [31] commented, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus is possible, as its nucleic acid has been found in blood samples, but the only finding of specific IgM in the newborn is not enough and the probability of a false positivity is high.",

Many guidelines recommend the newborn to be isolated in a designated COVID-19 neonatology unit until cleared, although some allow rooming-in in mother\u2019s room with due infection control measures (such as 2-m distance from cot to bed and droplet/contact precautions while breastfeeding). A SARS-CoV-2 test should be performed after birth: all probable or laboratory-confirmed newborns with SARS-CoV-2 should be isolated or cohorted in a single room (if possible) for at least 14 days. The quarantine room should be equipped with an isolated air cycle system and, given SARS-CoV-2 high infectivity, negative pressure isolation rooms are recommended, albeit rarely available [41]. Standard and additional infection control measures should be implemented immediately [47], such as visitor restriction policies and protected pathways.",

Antibiotics should be prescribed only to patients with probable or confirmed bacterial infection; empirical use should be avoided. Surfactant replacement therapy, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) might be effective for newborns with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome but no evidence-based data exist. The question of antenatal corticosteroids for induction of foetal lung maturation in COVID-19 -positive or -suspected mothers with preterm labor or predicted preterm delivery is controversial, since there is strong evidence that their use prevents death and improve long-term outcomes across the range of prematurity [48]; conversely, corticosteroids have shown no proven benefit and/or potential harm in other similar viral infections such as SARS, MERS, RSV and influenza [49]. In the absence of uniform guidelines to date, the risk/benefit ratio should be carefully weighed on an individual basis and take informed parental choices into account. For all procedures that may produce aerosols on suspected or confirmed infants, airborne precautions should be taken. In critically ill neonates, continuous renal replacement (CRRT) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could become necessary.",
