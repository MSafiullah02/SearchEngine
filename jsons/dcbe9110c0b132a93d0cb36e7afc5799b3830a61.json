Although RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 has become the standard method for direct diagnosis, these real-time PCR tests have some limitations, primarily dedicated infrastructure to avoid any biorisk, limited capacity and a long turnaround time (Y. . There is increasing pressure from the medical community and society to screen the population on a large scale. Serological tests in ELISA format or as immunochromatographic lateral flow assay (LFA) have recently become available from many manufacturers (Z. (Haveri et al., 2020) . These serological tests will be complementary to PCR tests both for screening and diagnosis of the population, for the purpose of population exits from containment in different countries and finally for future epidemiological studies. However, it is necessary to evaluate the analytical performance of these assays and also their place in clinical practice. Thus, the objective of our study was to evaluate four immunochromatographic assays for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the kinetics of their detection by these LFA.",

Moreover, we did not observe any real added value in IgM staining from these immunochromatographic tests. With this kind of test, it is very difficult to distinguish the very recent infection from the older one because some patients present early with IgG without IgM and for some a detectable IgM threshold appears later. Serological ELISA tests from research laboratories or portfolios of in vitro diagnostic manufacturers may allow a clearer distinction between IgM and IgG kinetics and their respective interest. Nevertheless, the value of these point of care tests seems obvious in countries with limited resources but perhaps also as the epidemic progresses in individuals in the form of self-homemade assay from a drop of blood on the fingertip. This type of test could be easily delivered to individuals and thus limit contact. In addition, in countries with strong health systems, these rapid detection tests may also find their way as doctor tests in emergency departments.",
