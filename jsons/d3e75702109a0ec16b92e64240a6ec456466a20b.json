This presumably reflects that viral proteins are being degraded at sites where they encounter MHC molecules. The main characteristic of class I1 MHC association, which is a function of the less frequent class I1 MHC-positive cells that tend to have wellrecognized antigen-processing functions, may be that such events occur in specialized organelles such as lysosomes. Class I MHC expression is associated with many more cell types, including fibroblasts and tumor cells, and may reflect more generalized degradative processes that are occurring in the cytoplasm. Questions concerning the nature of antigen processing and the recirculation of MHC molecules from the plasma are now of great interest.
