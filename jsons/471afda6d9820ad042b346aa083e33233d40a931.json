            "text": "This paper examines the challenges that governments and civil society faces in preparing for bioterrorist attacks -the challenges of reporting bioterrorism in the media, the psychological responses that are likely and how to deal with them, how terrorism may disrupt the political processes and how to respond to the needs of the population for calming, and accurate information while minimizing fear states and maximizing compliance with government instructions. It examines the psychological dimensions of mass bioterrorist attacks on the civil population and government responses, working first from the normal government expectation of panic to a more modulated recognition background research for this paper. that even when panic does occur, such as increased attachment, cohesive, and supportive societal behaviors in response to disaster situations. Likewise, this paper addresses medical, psychiatric, psychosocial, and informational needs that are likely to be encountered in the face of \"invisible\" threats and makes suggestions for designing risk communication strategies to address psychological contagion, acute and posttraumatic responses, and to maximize resilience in the face of the increased bioterror threats of today's world. Today's terrorists are skillful in their manipulation of mass media to amplify the effects of their attacks. In response, governments must be equally prepared and ready to remain calm and truthful in their communication in times of crisis, and must not compromise the core values of democracy in taking up the defense against terrorism.

            "text": "radiological, or chemical threats are the most terrifying of all. Instinctively all people fear poisons and a lethal, or poisoning agent that is unseen and difficult to comprehend can quickly and easily become in the public consciousness an all pervasive threat that seems impossible to protect against even if it has touched only a small portion of the population, or is only a threatened action. Bioterrorism is terrifying not only in the mind of the ordinary citizen, but perhaps even more so in the mind of the scientist, because of the threat of death or serious and perhaps deforming illness by contagion, which spreads spontaneously beyond the original attackthrough vectors the terrorists themselves cannot control. In the case of bioterrorism the agent released into society is alive and often lethal -much like the terrorists themselves -and continues to carry out their death threat beyond the original strike. In this case both the media and the biological agent itself amplify the original attack multiplying its terror causing effects. Likewise the psychological contagion that often occurs with the threat of or actuality of a bioterrorist attack is of paramount importance to consider when one looks ahead to how to promote resilience to this type of terrorism. This paper addresses the need for societies to think ahead and anticipate civilian responses to bioterrorism, to design prevention strategies, and promote resilience through communication -in the media and through governmental and nongovernmental channels. In this way society can be prepared to defend against terrorism when and if it does strike.",

Firstly, it involves investing huge amounts of resources into hardening defenses in terms of securing buildings, airports, and civil military installations. This defense is important in securing key resources. Yet it has been called a placebo response by some because in reality, the entire nation can be a target, total defense is illusory and any death will achieve media coverage -thereby radicalizing public opinion and demonstrating the ineffectiveness of the security forces (Mackenzie, 2006) . Secondly, tier of defense against terrorism includes infiltrating and destroying terrorist groups -by discovering and thwarting their plans ahead of time and raising questions about their methods and ideology within the groups (Atran, 2003; Post, 2006) . 1 society that help shape interactions amongst the population including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), media, and those intermediary institutions (e.g., professional associations, religious groups, labor unions, citizen advocacy organizations, etc.), which build links between the population, provide information, analyses and political responses, and that give voice to various sectors of society and enrich public participation in democracies.",

Likewise, information discovered in Afghanistan makes clear that al-Qaeda was engaged in a serious effort to develop a usable chemical and biological weapons capability. Seized materials include films of tests carried out by al-Qaeda operatives showing that the group achieved their goals enough to having reached the stage of limited testing of agents on live subjects. In the United Kingdom and France terrorists groups have utilized crude recipes for biological agents such as ricin (Hoffman, 2005; Schweitzer, 2003) . In the thwarted UK case the group planned to smear small amounts of ricin on the door handles of random vehicles and thereby hoped to create mass hysteria from a few deaths rather than enact a mass killing. 6 Terrorists have certainly observed that it is possible to undermine public confidence and create mass anxiety responses by simple and even limited dispersal of a biological agent. The huge public reaction to the anthrax attacks in the United States (and indeed worldwide when one considers the providers) included: shutting down buildings; strangling the mail system; workers donning masks and rubber gloves while processing mail; quarantining areas, requiring employees to take precautionary strong antibiotics, public and private stock piling of medicines, and widespread anxiety about anthrax. These responses made clear that one could both undermine public confidence and create widespread mass distress with relatively few anthrax attacks (Hoffman, 2005; Speckhard, 2002a) . Likewise the fact that it took 4 months and $41.7 million to decontaminate the Hart Senate Office Building and nearly $100 million to do the same in the Boca Raton postal facility demonstrated the high costs of responding to the dispersal of minute quantities of a biological agent. Terrorists learned from these events that rendering an important facility inoperable by virtue of biocontamination can have widespread and devastating social, psychological, and economic repercussions (Hoffman, 2005) . 6 The so-called Chechen cell of North Africans in Paris were discovered preparing ricin for an attack on the Russian embassy in Paris and the London group had already prepared large quantities of ricin for an unspecified attack. attacks throughout Europe which were taken seriously by emergency number of US embassies that were also affected, as well as the many hoax A.

UNDERMINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND CREATING ricin scandal it became apparent that the terrorists were more interested in their ability to undermine public confidence and to potentially create mass hysteria with a bioterrorism attack than in actually enacting a mass killing event. Likewise the Algerian cell's interest in ricin appears to be based in their inability to achieve sufficient media impact using strictly conventional attacks (Hoffman, 2005) . Terrorism relies upon making a strong media impact and bioterrorism has that potential.",

Recruitment, training and perhaps most important, a motivational ideology is daily transmitted globally via the Internet bringing on board a disparate (but unified by a common ideology) group of disenfranchised, alienated, frustrated, and even traumatized individuals living in both conflict and non-conflict zones willing to sign on to support and even enact terrorism. In terms of western security, this is particularly troublesome in Europe where radicalization among disenfranchised Muslim communities appears to be a swelling phenomenon. The unresolved conflicts and human rights violations in Chechnya, Palestine, Kashmir, and now in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay as well, all give fuel to the al-Qaeda ideology, which argues that Islam is under attack by corrupt western powers and militant jihad including attacks on civilians and self martyrdom operations is not only justified, but a duty. With the current ease of communication, lessening of technological barriers, convincing ideology, and a ready pool of recruits, it appears that the occurrence of a mass bioterrorism attack may simply be only a matter of time.",

In nearly all civil disasters that have been studied by researchers, holding aside the moments of escaping an imminent danger such as a fire, earthquake, hurricane, or bomb -researchers repeatedly have found volunteer their resources, and risk their lives to help each other. Society actually becomes more civil during times of disaster as social cohesion increases rather than decreases under threat: in the short-term attachment behaviors generally increase, social cohesion increases, and the heroic is often called forth in ordinary people (Speckhard, 2005a) . We have numerous studies that bear this out. 9/11 is a good example. After-the-event interviews of persons involved revealed that people did not take a \"me first attitude\", disabled and injured persons were not run over by panicking hordes or left behind, abandoned (Furedi, 2004) . On the contrary the 9/11 evacuation was self-generated, orderly, and without panic, and those who were hurt or disabled were carefully and calmly assisted and taken to emergency services (Glass and Schoch-Spana, 2002) . The explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant gives us another window in which to view the responses of citizenry in times of mass disaster. When the reactor was about to explode the plant operators did not abandon their posts and flee like cowards to protect themselves. Instead they heroically fought to the last moments to shut down the reactor, to contain the damage -many giving their lives to do so. The Madrid train bombings give us another example. Witnesses state that after the first explosions passengers helped one another and calmly began to exit the scene. Only when repeated blasts occurred did some begin to run. Even then, when it became clear that emergency vehicles were having a hard time getting to the platform, taxi drivers waiting for customers did not flee in fear, but volunteered themselves as makeshift ambulances and ferried wounded persons to emergency care (Speckhard, 2004b) . The same happened in the Moscow subway bombingspeople walked calmly for long distances in the darkness, helping the wounded to evacuate. When terrorists bombed a crowded rock concert outside of Moscow -the band agreed to bravely play on, the audience followed instructions not to stampede in fear and the wounded were carefully attended to. In the Moscow theater where 800 hostages were held by Chechen suicide terrorists the hostages also remained calm for the most part during their ordeal and helped one another (Speckhard, 2004a; Speckhard et al., 2004; Speckhard et al., 2005a, b) . Even in the Beslan hostage taking crisis where hundreds of children were held hostage, water and toilet privileges were withheld, and shooting occurred in front of the hostages -there were only limited outbreaks in times of threat. Total strangers help each other, open their homes, that citizenry has become quite attachment and community-oriented extremely heroic behaviors were displayed (Speckhard, 2005c) . The London public transportation bombings also met with relative calm, with Londoners quickly resuming confidence in the use of public transportation (Wessely, 2005) .",

While the psychological costs of living under a sustained and intense terror threat are still not well understood (likely causing hyperarousal states in many, bodily distress, etc.) we do also see that most of the Israeli population have on their own found ways to be resilient in the face of it. Terrorists aim at creating widespread horror, dread, and fear, and to divide society.

We still have not studied well the potential effects of a mass bioterrorism event in which the dread caused by the spread of an invisible, contagious, and potentially lethal pathogen may be horrendous and in fact lead to less resilient responses. In this case the spread of horror from the terrorist attack will be amplified not only by the mass media but also by the many vectors of contagious contact all of which are difficult for ordinary individuals, much less medical professionals to understand and cope with. Likewise trying to contain a potentially lethal contagious disease, that has a presymptomatic incubating period, and that can be spread through contact with others is extremely challenging and requires societal cohesion and compliance with rapidly responding and well-informed government authorities. In this case quarantines and the means of enforcing them, panic-driven hoarding of medicines and overwhelming the medical care services with \"worried well\" and psychosomatic individuals are issues that we know from other disasters might well occur and, which might severely impact societal resilience. Thus we cannot say in all cases we expect society to be resilient. When it comes to poisons, invisible toxins, and fear inducing contagious illness, we have to look at other incidents to draw lessons. of hysteria. For the most part the adults present calmed the children and some When a threat is invisible and difficult to comprehend, some individuals may be expected to respond with fear, aggression, hysteria, and even psychosomatic symptoms if the fear of a potential toxic exposure becomes overwhelming. Such responses have been witnessed in many events and are well documented in the literature. After the Goiania radioactive incident (Brandao Mello et al., 1991) , following Chernobyl (Bromet et al., 1998; Green et al., 1994; Havenaar et al., 2002; Speckhard, 2002b) , and after the sarin attacks in the Tokyo subway, medical systems were briefly overwhelmed by thousands of individuals who feared that they had the symptoms of poisoning, many who became psychosomatically ill. The explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was perhaps the most serious \"invisible\" threat to date. Likewise the Bhopal and Goiania and other similar incidents give us additional information making clear that there are unique psychological and fear responses to \"invisible\" toxins, poisons, and contaminants, as well as the widespread dread of pervasive and random threat that accompanies conventional terrorism.",

These two contagionsemotional and behavioral likely explain the psychology behind the hysterical buy out of duct tape in the United States when word got out that the Homeland defense report had made mention of duct tape as a useful means of protecting oneself from chemical and biological attacks. Similarly it can explain in part why many Americans were massively noncompliant and failed to heed public health officials instructions not to stockpile Cipro (flaxocin) the antibiotic used to treat anthrax, instead of following a general panic among many to buy out unnecessary antibiotics and perhaps by doing so deprive those truly in need of them. If the anthrax attacks had been widespread, this may have caused significant hardship for some. As of this writing, we see the dread and dismay caused as Avian flu makes its way westward, with many citizens overly worried and rejecting poultry products and others noncompliant due to economic concerns of losing livelihoods, with the long-term health and economic consequences still unknown. Certainly governments must plan ahead for how they would handle issues of quarantine if it were needed and work beforehand with the public to get their participation and acceptance for plans, as well as with the media, police, military, or national guard units that would be responsible for reporting on and enforcing quarantine so that as much as possible contentious issues are dealt with and anticipated beforehand. Even rehearsing how a decontamination unit would function in a mass terror setting is important for small but crucial issues like deciding does everyone who goes through the unit have to strip naked and if so can provisions be made for segregating the sexes -a difficult issue for those for whom modesty is a key value; how do decontamination units handle the need to give up contaminated items including car keys -raising the issue of how does one get home; or how to handle the surrender of contaminated mobile phones -creating stresses and tensions for family members who can no longer check on and reassure their loved ones. Small but crucial issues like these if anticipated and thought through beforehand, with useful remedies built into the response scenarios can be arranged for the least stressful responses. New models of readiness are necessary to counter this threat especially when it pertains to biological terrorism because biological contamination raises unique and difficult issues, differing dramatically from other types of terrorism.",

Governments and media must work together preparing ahead of time on how to communicate calmly in such crises in a manner that will offer useful preventative measures, minimize the potential negative effects of psychosocial contagions (including citizenry becoming noncompliant and aggressive), prevent mass sociogenic illness from occurring, and prevent overwhelming of the medical systems by those whose emotional state has put them in need of medical care.

Hysterical contagions involve the spread by contact, including mass media exposure, of reported symptoms and experiences usually associated with clinical hysteria (hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, fainting, etc.) in the absence of exposure to a pathogen. Such illnesses often begin with exposure of a limited group to a biological contagion or chemical toxin with the others around these persons or learning of them responding hysterically with some form of nervous excitation, including a significant loss or alteration of function, and physical symptoms with no basis in physical etiology. These types of illness often affect members of a cohesive group although they can leap across groups when common links are made in reality or imagination. Such links are often made through the mass media in which one quite limited group of individuals is actually exposed to a biological or chemical toxin and has real symptoms but other groups fear that they too have been exposed.",

For instance, following the February 2004 Moscow subway suicide bombing that killed less than 200 persons, Moscow's Carnegie Center Dmitri Trenin stated, \"Every time I go down into the underground I wonder if I will finish my journey. Now nine million people feeling they are playing Russian roulette\" (Ostrovsky, 2004) . While this was a statement of his feelings, it reflects the sense of psychological contagion that can occur when nine million people fear an event that affected only a very small proportion of their total. Statistically the dreaded terror event is much more unlikely to happen to them than many other ordinary horrors that they forget to fear. The same occurred with the sniper in the Washington area in the fall of 2002, with fear of a deadly but highly unlikely threat nearly paralyzing a huge metropolitan area. Terrorists win when they can create a sense of dread of a pervasive and random threat -one that can strike anyone, anywhere at anytime.

Most of the potential bioterrorist threats are clear -although the uncertainty lies as to where, when and how. Thus it is possible for government to think ahead to what the population needs to know to respond calmly and with insight.

It was also not clear who should take charge of the multiple units who converged upon the site and when the decontamination unit did not arrive (it went to another facility by accident) the entire \"rescue\" was delayed by hours. Likewise the ambulatory contaminated \"victims\" ran to ambulances who refused to take them -because they were contaminatedand then ran through the neighborhood. Had it been a real chemical or biological attack the contaminant or pathogen would likely have been widely spread. A similar public safety exercise known as TOPOFF 2 -for \"Top Officials 2,\" sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Safety and State designed to test and improve US domestic response to terrorist incidents, carried out a fictional simultaneous attack against Chicago using pneumonic plague and Seattle using a radiological bomb in May 2003. Similar to the NATO support facility exercise the real first responders were not alerted ahead of time that it was a fictional attack but once on the scene worked simulated crime scenes and treated volunteers pretending to be victims. Nineteen federal agencies, as well as state and local emergency responders from Illinois and Washington, as well as from Canada and the American Red Cross were involved. The exercise provided valuable lessons, including the realization that multiple control centers, numerous liaisons, and increasing numbers of response teams only complicated the emergency effort. Likewise officials noted that it was essential to monitor and correct false media reports that might have inflamed the public to panic (Miller, 2003) . Certainly we know from such exercises that resources must be devoted not only to equipment but to careful planning of how to respond well technically and media-wise to terrorist threats, especially those involving radiological, biological, and chemical terrorism.",

This is extremely difficult to do as lethal contagious bioterrorist attacks will follow a trajectory beginning with exposure, to incubation, to latently symptomatic individuals to those who succumb and die. In the event of a biological terrorism attack public health officials working with government will be called upon to quickly identify if they are dealing with a bacteria, virus, or toxin and to identify it as quickly as possible and mount an efficient response. Since biological infections have an incubation period an efficient response could mean cordoning off those who have been exposed and who are potentially dangerous transmitters (vectors) of the disease. This could mean quarantining symptomless individuals in an effort to make sure that those who have been exposed and could, but are not necessarily proven to, be incubating disease do not spread it to others. It is unclear in a liberal democracy if government officials would be able to establish quarantines that keep people in, much less out, of a zone that has been identified as \"exposed\" to a lethal biological agent. In these cases one might envision in the United States, the National Guard or police troops called in to quarantine off a subpopulation of highly upset individuals who have families, cares, and responsibilities outside of the zone being quarantined (Pollack, 2006) .",

After the initial stages of the Beslan hostage-taking siege, Ossetian authorities shut down broadcasts from the local televisions stations in an effort to defuse some of the local tension of televised broadcasting of the event. Likewise psychiatric consultants brought in to help with the siege realized that mothers sitting at home with nothing more to do than agitate and shame their husbands for not going to rescue their children caught in the school building had to be addressed. They organized meaningful tasks for the mothers and opened a briefing center where every three hours or so they gave reports to the townspeople outlining everything they knew about the siege, potential negotiations, the state of the children inside, and so on. While it is unlikely that western countries would follow suit in shutting down television broadcasting, and even in Beslan, cable networks, Internet, and radio continued to broadcast in the area, it is useful to think ahead on how to work with the media and how to give citizens useful tasks to help them be empowered to be heroic in a crisis versus feeling helpless and frustrated with a sense of powerless inactivity.",

The nature of a bioterrorism event, however, is less likely to result in acute posttraumatic stress states (unless there are massive numbers of deaths) than one might expect when the attack involves an explosion or other act of mass violence because the traumatic stressor is information versus a witnessed trauma. This is the difficulty inherent in dealing with \"invisible\" stressors, such as toxins, pathogens, and contaminants -they create fear, horror, and dread but there is often no clearly defined event to address, but instead an amorphous and undefined emotional horror.",

In all cases reassuring information and calm responses are the most helpful. There is a strong body of literature that demonstrates that intrusive psychological debriefing applied in a coercive manner in the immediate aftermath of traumas, is neither necessary or helpful, and sometimes even harmful, as most acute and posttraumatic symptoms to terror attacks decline overtime when normal coping channels are utilized (National Institute of Mental Health, 2002).

Learning that these are normal responses to trauma often helps individuals to move beyond them more easily versus get caught up in additional fears and shame over why they are not feeling or acting normal, as well as to diminish the avoidance responses that often occur in those who suffer from posttraumatic reexperiencing (Speckhard, 2002a; Speckhard et al., 2005a, b) . Likewise those who have \"caught\" contagious psychological states and somatic symptoms are often also well served to receive medical care assuring them they are not a victim of the biological contaminate, as well as reassuring them that it is normal for some individuals to \"catch\" fear states and for these to evidence themselves in the body. In this way the individual is not shamed by having somatized their stress, something most individuals find distressing in itself, but also receives a logical explanation for what is happening in their body -an explanation that if judged as credible (and this is crucial) allows them to calm the bodily arousal that is supporting the negative symptoms.

We need to always occupy the higher ground and continually remind, especially those who support the new \"religiously\" oriented terrorists, that Islam in particular does not condone killing by poison and that many scholars of the Koran takes a firm stance against the use of such weapons.

Bioterrorism involves an invisible threat that can create the opposite feelings: fear, horror, and dread as the actual contaminate spreads by biological contagion, and fear states including psychosomatic responses spread via psychosocial contagion. To defend against bioterrorism government initiatives should have been well thought out ahead of time, include preparatory education and a participatory process of the citizenry, preparation of experts who will be called on to help and work ahead of time with the media who will report the crisis, coupled with leaders whose words and actions inspire the belief that government is credible, calm, and acting in the public's behalf during a crisis. When leaders are honest, communicate calmly, and have prepared their societies ahead of time to respond well to terrorism, we can expect resilient responses. In times of threat and disaster populations often become attachment oriented and cohesive and heroic behaviors are frequently displayed.",
