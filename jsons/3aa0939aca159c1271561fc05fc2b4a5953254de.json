The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure. Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission is also speculated. Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease. In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms. Scientific researches on these drugs reveal the presence of a number of pharmacologically active substances, which may provide a new insight into the management of infections and epidemics.

It is now understood that SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% structural similarity with a bat coronavirus (CoV RaTG13) and 79.5% similarity with SARS-CoV. However, its spike (S) glycoprotein has a 10-20 times higher affinity to human ACE2 receptors as compared to SARS-CoV, leading to more chances of human-to-human transmission; though having a lesser mortality rate (average 3.4 %) than that of SARS (9.6%) and MERS (35%) respectively (Guo et al., 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 140, "text": "(Sun et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 309, "end": 331, "text": "(Gautret et al., 2020;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 332, "end": 355, "text": "Rasmussen et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 714, "end": 729, "text": "(average 3.4 %)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 783, "end": 801, "text": "(Guo et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"text": "The present control strategies of the disease include the reduction of secondary infections by early diagnosis and isolation of cases, providing optimal care to infected patients, and the development of effective diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies, including vaccines (WHO, 2020) .

Researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has close structural resemblance with bat coronaviruses, supporting the theory that SARS-CoV-2 was derived from bats. Snakes have also been suggested as a likely wildlife repository of the virus. However, there was an exponential rise in unrelated cases since late December 2019 (Sun et al., 2020) . Since bats are a natural reservoir of various coronaviruses, a zoonotic angle is not entirely ruled out. But statistics reveal that the disease is spreading rapidly by human-to-human transmission (Guo et al., 2020) . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in broncho-alveolar secretions, sputum, saliva, throat and nasopharyngeal secretions of infected persons (Phan, 2020b) . About 50-80% transmission of the virus is from asymptomatic carriers, hence transmission through speech droplets is considered as a significant mode of transmission of the disease. The virus can be transmitted directly through speech droplets, or through fomites (Anfinrud et al., 2020) . Based on reports, it is estimated that 44% of the transmission can occur before the onset of symptoms (He et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptors, which are present in abundance in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has also been detected in feces. Hence, an oro-fecal route of transmission is also considered. Air-borne transmission is not completely ruled out (Ling et al., 2020) . There is also evidence that the virus can be transmitted through tears and body fluids if they come into contact with the mucosa of eyes, mouth or nose. Depending on the route of entry, the virus binds to ACE2 receptors and infects type-2 pneumocytes, ciliated bronchial epithelium of lungs (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020) , or enterocytes of the small intestine.

Just when we thought we had conquered microbes (Adedeji, 2016; Mohr, 2016) , three viruses, belonging to a family hitherto considered less virulent, took the 21 st century by storm (\u010civljak et al., 2020) . The newest of them, SARS-CoV-2, is, fortunately, lesser on virulence than its two recent predecessors, namely SARS-CoV and MERS, but higher in infectivity (Vellingiri et al., 2020) . This simply implies that it has more chances of reaching the susceptible population and causing higher mortality. There is also speculation that close to two-thirds of Covid-19 cases from China may have gone undetected (Menkir et al., 2020) . Going by the present trends, the cases are likely to increase in the near future (Vellingiri et al., 2020) .
