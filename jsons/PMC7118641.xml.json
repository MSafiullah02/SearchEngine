The administration of President Trump is set to convert the US from a net energy importer into a global energy superpower. To this end, the US has increased exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Asian markets and pushed European countries to buy natural gas from US producers as a putative way to reduce European dependence on Russian gas supplies. At the same time, the US withdrew from a number of binding international environmental commitments, notably the Paris Climate Agreement. In dealing with unfriendly oil exporters, Venezuela and Iran, the US imposed sanctions and used coercive diplomacy.",

The combination of these factors contributed to a major systemic transformation in global energy with wide-ranging and long-lasting policy implications. Some experts believe that this profound shift will \u201credraw the geopolitical map of the 21st century\u201d (IRENA, 2019, 14) and undermine the power of long-term energy producers. This raises the question: What implications do these changes have for the global energy system? And what accounts for the recent shift in the international energy regime to a new energy order characterized by the rise of the US as a net energy exporter, the relative abundance of energy resources and the persistence of low oil prices?",

Drawing on Krasner\u2019s earlier formulation, Colgan and collaborators (2012) argue that shifts in energy regime complexes follow a path-dependent pattern and are best captured by the punctuated equilibrium model. In their account, institutional change is driven by the degree of dissatisfaction of major oil importing or exporting states which in turn is determined by rational calculations of substantial revenue loss that the government risks to incur. They argue that \u201c[d]uring periods of high oil prices (e.g., 1973\u201381; 2003\u20132010), we expect to see dissatisfied energy-importing states acting to change institutional arrangements to handle contemporary problems. Conversely, in periods of low oil prices (e.g., 1985\u201386, 1998), we expect to see dissatisfied energy-exporting states acting to change institutional arrangements\u201d (Colgan et al., 2012, 133).",

            "text": "Recent developments challenge the view that changes are always brought forward in the shape of institutionalization, as Trump\u2019s unilateralism made it abundantly clear. The new status of the US in the nascent oil order evades easy categorization into an exporter-importer binary. Bolstered by the surge in shale gas and oil production, the US has opted out of multilateral climate commitments and rolled back about 90 federal environmental regulations (Popovich et al., 2019). The Trump administration has acted unilaterally, rather than through international organizations, to pursue US energy interests. On the one hand, there is a certain degree of continuity on climate policy with previous US administrations (MacNeil and Paterson, 2020), and there were precedents, notably the failure of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. On the other hand, the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks on Obama-era environmental policies and the retreat from a number of international environmental treaties (Seo, 2019) is a manifestation of the erosion of the international energy regime as a global regulatory framework. Most importantly, Trump\u2019s actions undermine US leadership of international climate regime and hurts multilateral efforts to curb greenhouse emissions (Bordoff, 2017). This observation is generally in line with the contention in recent International Relations scholarship that the US-led post-World War II international liberal order appears to be in disarray. After the election of Trump in 2016, the US displayed apparent aversion to membership and participation in multilateral trade regimes, military security alliances, human rights and environmental agreements (Ikenberry, 2018).",

Second, this shift towards a new, poorly-institutionalized energy order has been driven by two, largely contingent events: the fracking (technological) revolution in the US and the election of Trump as US president. Both events were omitted by existing theoretical models in energy research or political science literature respectively due to their rigid paradigmatic framework.",

The surge in shale oil and gas production has transformed the US energy industry and turned the US into an energy superpower capable of competing with traditional energy producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the ascent of the US as a new energy superpower is reshaping the world energy map. The increase in energy production in the US and other new producers means there is enough oil to match the world demand for fossil fuels keeping global oil prices low. Lower oil prices appear to weaken the geopolitical leverage that traditional energy exporters \u2013 OPEC plus Russia \u2013 used to enjoy for almost half a century (Blackwill and O\u2019Sullivan, 2014). Moreover, a bigger share of renewables and low-carbon sources in the energy mixes of leading industrialized economies is expected to make a greater number of countries energy self-sufficient in the long run. Lower energy prices already hit hard the fiscal balances of traditional oil and gas producers, most of which are governed by authoritarian regimes (Ross, 2014). Fiscal dependence on oil revenue makes oil-dependent states vulnerable to external shocks, and their survival hinges on the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). SWFs are state-owned investment funds that accumulate, among other assets, state revenues from mineral wealth. These reserve funds provide autocratic governments with a protection cushion shielding them against adverse oil price shocks in periods of oil price hikes (Ahmadov, 2019).",

In the long run, a decline in fossil fuel demand is likely to push the oil price down making extraction of such resources commercially unattractive (Manley et al., 2017). While renewables or low-carbon sources have grown fast, an even partial transition to renewables by 2050 seems unrealistic (REN21 2017). The global fossil fuel system, according to IRENA (2019, 64), relies on a massive built-in infrastructure of oil wells, pipelines, tankers and refineries. This stock of physical assets worth US$25 trillion may be stranded due to technological innovations and government efforts to switch to renewables and low-carbon alternatives. Van de Graaf and Bradshaw (2018) predict that the established oil producers might \u201cend up with lower future revenues from [their] assets (the bursting of the \u2018carbon bubble\u2019), capital investments in oil infrastructure that cannot be recovered because of reduced demand or reduced prices (\u2018stranded assets\u2019) and existing oil reserves that are left unexploited (\u2018unburnable oil reserves\u2019)\u201d (1322). On the other hand, the interlocking web of infrastructure, technologies and institutions underpinning the existing fossil fuel-based system creates a path-dependent process of \u2018carbon lock-in\u2019 which inhibits transitions toward low-carbon alternatives (Seto et al., 2016).",

The 2004\u20132014 commodity price boom encouraged companies to invest in exploration and production in previously technologically inaccessible areas, such as deep shelves of the Caspian Sea and offshore fields in Latin America, West Africa and the Arctic (Kemp, 2015). The increase of supply from traditional sources and the diversification of energy sources led to excess supply of fossil fuels in international energy markets. For example, in 2018, the so-called Big Three (Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US) saw oil output reach record levels (IEA, 2018a, IEA, 2018b). The oversupply of oil and gas from North American sources was one of the drivers for the fall in oil prices in mid-2014. This low-price constellation continues to this day. The Brent crude prices that averaged US $111 per barrel (bbl) in 2011\u20132012 fell to as low as 52 $/bbl in 2015 and hovered around 44\u201371 $/bbl in the following three years (BP Statistical Review of Energy, 2019). The global outbreak of coronavirus since the start of 2020 and shrinking oil demand have driven crude prices further down. On March 6, 2020, at an OPEC + meeting in Vienna Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to negotiate production cuts of 1.5 million bbl/d which caused Brent crude prices to plunge to below 36 $/bbl (Kotsev, 2020).",

            "text": "In reality, Trump\u2019s \u2018energy dominance\u2019 doctrine reverses America\u2019s long-standing conservationist energy policy. Since the 1970s, America shifted from being an oil producer to being an importer of oil. In 1956, geologist M. King Hubbert formulated the \u2018peak oil\u2019 theory which predicted the bell-shaped curve of US oil production that would peak around 1965 and decline in the early 1970s. Peak oil theory underpinned much of US energy strategy in the 1950s and 1960s fueling a concern that oil resources are nearing its end. Hence, the strategic significance US policymakers attached to the Persian Gulf energy reserves that have since then been seen as vital to US national security (Hendrix, 2018). Formulated in 1980, the Carter doctrine states that \u201can attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force\u201d (Davis, 2017). In contrast to the current \u201cenergy dominance\u201d doctrine, the US policy traditionally focused on domestic conservation and the reliance on supplies from foreign sources. In the wake of the 1970s oil shocks, the US enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) and the Export Administration Act of 1979, curtailing the ability of domestic oil producers to export crude (Hendrix, 2018). This ban was lifted in 2015.",

The pace of transition to low-carbon sources will depend on direct access to sufficient wind and solar energy, and any other renewable or low carbon resources (renewables potential), as well as the availability and affordability of renewable energy technologies such as solar thermal technology, wind farms, smart grid systems, and storage capacities (REN21 2017).",

With the crude oil price in the $50\u201360 per barrel range after the 2014 price fall, shale companies were failing to deliver returns. Frustrated by poor returns, investors and lenders lose an interest in shale production (Cunningham, 2019). Limited access to capital hurts drilling companies.

However, it is not the case that the events of 1973 were completely unanticipated, but rather that a single scenario which incorporated the main elements was given greater expectation for occurring a year or two later. In a series of scenarios published in 1971\u20131973, Shell referred to the possibility that power would shift from international oil companies to the oil-producing nations, and this shift could cause a surge in oil prices (Wilkinson and Kupers, 2013). Shell\u2019s scenario planning team also pointed out that smaller oil-producing countries in the Middle East would limit further depletion of petroleum resources for the lack of absorptive capacity to manage the inflows of oil revenues (Jefferson, 2012, 187). The 1979 oil crisis following the downfall of the Shah in Iran and its aftermath were elements included in Shell scenario thinking from March, 1976, and the emergence of a \u2018Hard Times\u2019 scenario (March 1981) anticipating economic slowdown and the drop in oil prices (Jefferson, 2012, 193; Chermack, 2017, 100\u2013101).",

            "text": "As a number of recent studies rightly pointed out, the global energy system is undergoing major changes, and the rise of the US as an energy superpower is reconfiguring the global energy order in ways that will have far-reaching implications for energy markets across the globe. Some of the policy implications of this transformation include the following:-As energy transitions to low-carbon and renewable energy sources advance, more countries are expected to become energy self-sufficient in the long run. The pace of a low-carbon transition will depend on a multitude of factors, and the inertia of carbon lock-in will militate against it.-The surge in shale production in the US reduced its import dependence on supplies from the Middle East and other regions. Shale development in Northern America is thus weakening the power of traditional energy producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela.-An excess supply from the US and other new producers is likely to keep oil prices low. Lower prices will reduce the fiscal revenue base of traditional oil and gas producers. Elites in these countries will be pushed hard to diversify the economy or otherwise face the risk of fiscal crisis and social instability.-The US is now competing with traditional energy producers for export markets in Europe and Asia and has tightened sanctions against Iran and Venezuela. To secure its energy export interests abroad, the US might be tempted to use coercive diplomacy against market competitors.\n",

            "text": "How well are we equipped to understand this transformation in global energy? Focusing on some recent work on energy regime complex, I have identified several gaps in our understanding of change in the global energy system:1)There is a great deal of contingency in recent changes in global energy order and IPE theories should develop a more nuanced approach to understanding systemic change in the international energy order paying attention to how actors and their belief systems can have transformative impacts on important outcomes. While contingencies are an inherent feature of social reality, the scenario approach can be a useful heuristic for dealing with uncertainties.2)Incremental technological advances \u2013 such as rock fracturing \u2013 can sometimes lead to revolutionary transformations; these sorts of technological innovations are key to understanding the processes driving energy transitions.3)An emerging energy order appears to be less institutionalized than is commonly believed; the US withdrawal from multilateral agreements threatens the continued existence of liberal institutionalism; perhaps, we will see a greater fragmentation of the liberal order and its replacement with a multipolar one dominated by China, Russia and other major powers.\n",
