Health care experts predict a shortage of N95 FFRs if a severe pandemic occurs, and an option that has been suggested for mitigating such an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices. Before the effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and toxicity to the end user post treatment. This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies. Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL). Toxic byproducts were also evaluated, and two suspected toxins were detected after ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps. The results provide encouragement to efforts promoting the evolution of effective strategies for decontamination and reuse of FFRs.",

The Hong Kong Flu of 1968 had been the most recent pandemic until the H1N1 pandemic was realized in the spring of 2009 with the appearance of the swine flu (H1N1). (1, 2) On June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert level to 6, which indicated the onset of a pandemic. As of June 8, 2009 , WHO reported almost 30,000 confirmed cases of H1N1 and 145 deaths worldwide. (3) More than 13,000 cases and 27 deaths were reported in the United States alone. (3) WHO's December 2009 update (4) reported H1N1 infections in more than 209 countries and attributed over 12,220 deaths to H1N1 infections. Although this outbreak did not have the virulence of earlier pandemics, it was sufficiently similar to previous pandemics to merit concern. It is not certain that the current H1N1 strain will mutate into a more virulent form, but health care workers are taking the possibility very seriously.",

            "text": "A primary barrier used to protect health care workers and the general public from airborne infections is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved filtering facepiece respirator (FFR). (Note that although many types of FFRs are available, this report focuses on six models of N95 FFRs. All references to FFRs in this manuscript specify N95 FFRs). The FFR is rated to capture \u226595% of airborne 300-nm particles and has been proven to remove infectious microorganisms from the airstream. (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) The modes for human-to-human transmission of influenza are actively debated, (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) but data have been reported that support aerosol transmission. (11, 15) This information led the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to recommend that workers wear a properly fitted NIOSHapproved FFR during a pandemic influenza outbreak. (17, 18) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also demonstrated their support of FFRs by issuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), which approves release of FFRs from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) for use by the general public. (19) The CDC estimated that during a pandemic lasting 42 days, more than 90 million FFRs would be required for health care workers alone. (20) These projections indicate that a shortage of FFRs is likely to occur, which would leave health care workers exposed and might aggravate the severity of the pandemic. A possible solution for alleviating an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the FFRs, (20) and Cal/OSHA has set a relevant precedent by issuing guidelines for extended use and re-donning as conservation measures recommended by the California Department of Public Health. (21) FFRs are labeled as \"single-use\" devices and have not been approved for reuse. Consequently, very few data are available that describe how FFRs behave following treatment with decontamination agents. Many properties must be studied before FFR decontamination and reuse would be allowed: filtration efficiency, pressure drop, fit, residual chemicals, and overall durability are key questions that must be addressed. NIOSH has reported initial studies that suggest that some technologies can be used to decontaminate FFRs without affecting performance. (22) However, other technologies tested-for example, autoclaving-rendered the FFRs unusable. (22) These tests were performed on a limited number of FFR models, and more research is needed on a larger number of FFRs to properly evaluate decontamination technologies.",

Respirator P2 retained almost 2 mg of chlorine equivalents; assuming complete reversal to chlorine gas, \u223c1 g/m 3 Cl 2 is available in 2 L, and \u223c5 mg/m 3 in 375 L. The IDLH for chlorine is 29 mg/m 3 , but the calculated concentration would occur during only one inhalation, and much of the gas would be dissipated when the package containing the respirator was opened. In addition, the LC 50 for several mammalian species is a Ct [product of concentration multiplied by time] of >400 mg-hour/m 3 , (31) and the equilibrium constant strongly disfavors formation of chlorine-that is, most of the oxidant will remain on the FFR as a salt and act only as a potential skin irritant-so actual concentrations will present no health risk. Reinforcing this conclusion, the 15-min hypothetical worst-possible concentration is only 3.5 times the REL for chlorine (32) and twice the STEL and OSHA's permissible exposure limit (PEL). The slight residual odor noted could be tolerated by all except a few highly susceptible individuals.",
