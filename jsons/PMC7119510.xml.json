            "text": "In the course of many experiments in virology, it is of interest to determine the sense and amount of viral RNAs. For example, in the case of viruses with a RNA genome, the presence of RNAs of antigenomic sense usually indicates active viral transcription. In other studies, in which viral gene expression appears altered, it would be informative to determine whether this change is correlated with corresponding alterations in the level of positive and negative sense viral RNA. A striking change in the expected relative or absolute abundance of viral RNA of a given sense may provide clues as to the mode of viral replication in vitro or of viral pathogenesis in vivo.",

However, in many experiments, particularly with samples obtained in vivo, viral RNA may not be of sufficiently high concentration to allow detection by this technique. Clearly, RT-PCR assays provide high sensitivity (approximately 3\u20134 logs more than Northern blot or nuclease protection assays) (Foley et al., 1993, Ausubel et al., 1994, K\u00f6hler et al., 1995) and are widely used to detect trace amounts of viral RNA in many experiments. In theory, it should be straightforward to assay for viral RNAs of a given sense by using a primer of defined polarity in the RT step of the procedure. For example, if the RT step is primed by an oligonucleotide which binds negative sense viral RNA, cDNA should be produced for subsequent PCR amplification if and only if viral templates of negative sense are present in the original specimen; if negative sense viral RNA is not present, the reaction should be aborted at the RT step, and theoretically no PCR amplification products will be produced.",

For example, in control assays using defined hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA templates, Lanford et al. (1994) demonstrated that an RT-PCR product could be obtained with the \u2018incorrect\u2019 sense RT primer or even in the absence of any primer in the RT step. They hypothesized that artifacts arose through a combination of factors, including false priming of the incorrect strand by the RT primer, self-priming of the viral RNA template at regions of secondary structure, and random priming by contaminating or irrelevant nucleic acids. Similarly, Gunji et al. (1994), also working with HCV, showed that conventional RT-PCR assays were not able to reliably detect viral positive and negative sense RNAs in samples which contained cellular RNAs. These investigators suggested that fragmented cellular RNAs were able to prime viral templates, giving rise to unreliable results.",

However, upon critical review of the state of available sense-specific RT-PCR assays, McGuinness et al. (1994) indicated \u2018\u2026 our results clearly establish that reliable detection of HCV-negative RNA strand is not yet achievable by current methods\u2019. Recently, Lerat et al., (1996) demonstrated that even optimized protocols artifactually detect negative sense HCV RNA when these assays are applied to clinical samples. They indicated that artifacts are most likely due to self-priming by abundant viral RNAs in infected tissues. Collectively, these careful studies, using HCV as a model virus, indicate that technical impediments to unambiguous strand-specific RT-PCR determinations of viral RNA may still exist.",

To this end, a RT-PCR procedure was developed and validated which can reliably measure positive and negative sense viral RNA present in trace amounts in a complex biological sample. We describe potential pitfalls of sense-specific RT-PCR assays (ssRT-PCR), as well as techniques introduced by other investigators (Chaves et al., 1994, Lanford et al., 1994, Lerat et al., 1996) and our laboratory to circumvent these artifacts. Finally, the addition of competitor RNA templates to the assay allowed the ssRT-PCR to be performed quantitatively (qssRT-PCR). The method described may easily be adapted to other viral systems, where it is essential to determine the sense and amount of viral RNAs in heterogeneous samples which may contain inhibitory or confounding molecules.",

Also, we found that the assay for positive sense or negative sense coronavirus RNA did not yield a product when 105 fg of the opposite or \u2018wrong\u2019 sense was added to the reaction (Fig. 2). However, when 106 fg of the inappropriate RNA template was added to the reaction, a non-specific product was detected (data not shown), indicating that the assay has a maximal differential amplification capacity of approximately 100 000-fold with regard to detection of a specific RNA template relative to an excess of inappropriate or opposite sense RNA template. Fig. 3\n, when compared to Fig. 2, indicates that the inhibition of specific RNA detection in the presence of an excess of wrong sense RNA is insignificant. Finally, in pilot experiments, we have been able to extend the sensitivity of the ssRT-PCR to the attogram (approximately 10 MHV-4 RNA molecules) range by means of nested PCR (Zazzi et al., 1993) methodology using primers AM8-3 and AM8-4 (data not shown); in this case, it is essential in each experiment to include controls of sense specificity, e.g. a control reaction demonstrating the non-amplification of an appropriate concentration of wrong sense RNA.",

Additional bands were sometimes observed during competitive reactions (Fig. 4); these bands likely represent heteroduplexes (Schneeberger et al., 1995) and were not of sufficient magnitude to interfere with quantification. During densitometric analyses, bands corresponding to heteroduplexes were ignored, as these species would be expected to detract from the intensity of both competitor (MHV-4 and N-del) RNAs equally. Three assays were performed by standard curve methodology on separate days (Table 2\n). As indicated, the coefficients of variation for the positive sense and negative sense assays were 3.0 and 5.7%, respectively. Similar reproducibility was obtained with RNAs obtained from mouse brains during chronic pathogenesis studies and with RNAs derived from infected tissue cultures (data not shown).",

Using equimolar methodology, qssRT-PCR showed that at maximal infection 12 h after inoculation, FL5 cells contained 0.86 ng or 2.7\u00d7109 molecules of RNA competing with N-del template per microgram of total cellular RNA and, further, that >99% of the MHV-4 RNA was of positive sense (data not shown). Assuming that the yield of total RNA extracted from FL5 cells was approximately 5.0\u00d710\u22126 \u03bcg of RNA/cell (RNA STAT 60 instructions), on a molar basis these results are in close agreement with prior studies based on hybridization kinetics (Cheley et al., 1981) and Northern blots (Hofmann et al., 1990) which indicate that at the peak of coronavirus infection in vitro in the order of 104 molecules of viral RNA are present in each infected cell.

While RT-PCR in theory should provide the requisite specificity and sensitivity for these determinations, our initial, exploratory experiments showed that conventional RT-PCR assays for viral RNAs were not sense-specific, let alone quantitative, findings which were concordant with those of previous investigators (Willems et al., 1993). In this regard, most RT-PCR protocols are primarily designed to optimize sensitivity rather than discrimination with regard to RNA template amplification. In other words, in most applications, low levels of amplification of non-specific products are acceptable and do not detract from the primary purpose of the assay, which is efficient detection of the RNA of interest. By contrast, in ssRT-PCR specificity is the over-riding consideration, since the aim of the assay is unambiguous detection of an RNA of a given sense, often under circumstances in which the RNA is orders of magnitude less abundant than an RNA species of the opposite sense (e.g. Table 2). In this case, assay parameters must be such that non-amplification of incorrect sense RNA templates is virtually absolute, since any amplification of the incorrect sense RNA, however infrequent, will be geometrically expanded during PCR and may easily lend to invalid results.",

However, in the optimized assay, the RT step is performed at 48\u00b0C, close to the melting temperature (TM) of anti-viral sequences of our RT primers, and the PCR annealing step, which depends on longer tag:anti-tag sequence interactions, is set at 65\u00b0C. Thus, both the RT and PCR phases of our assay are each conducted under conditions of high stringency, at the threshold at which specific primers are able to anneal correctly to specific templates; in this case, the high stringency in both phases of the assay strongly inhibits non-specific priming.",

In reported assays in which the anti-viral and tag sequences of the hybrid primers are both approximately 16\u201318 nucleotides, resulting in RT reaction and PCR annealing temperatures which are close to each other, hybrid RT primers are available and can anneal during the PCR phase of the assay. This availability may result in multiple rounds of cumulative non-specific priming during the PCR, for example, of hybrid primers to aberrant viral RNAs, prior mis-primed products, or to plasmid-derived DNA (in the case of in vitro transcribed RNA standards). In the optimized PCR described, primers carried over from the RT step into the PCR steps are unlikely to misprime, since PCR annealing occurs at temperatures which exceed the TM of viral:anti-viral template:primer interactions but are optimal for specific binding of longer tag:anti-tag sequences. Also, during the PCR phase of the assay, the primers for this step are at 20-fold molar excess relative to primers carried over from the RT step. This discrepancy puts primers from the RT step at a further relative disadvantage during the PCR steps and favors specific tag:anti-tag interactions during the PCR.",

In competitive assays undertaken at lower temperatures, RT of viral RNA was diminished relative to in vitro MHV-4 transcribed templates (e.g. N-del), suggesting that RNA derived from virus may have extensive secondary structure or other features at 42\u00b0C which decrease the processivity of MMLV on this template.

            "text": "A third methodological consideration relates to the requirement that the specificity of ssRT-PCR assays must be tested with control RNA templates of known sense. Typically, such RNA standards are transcribed in vitro from DNA plasmids. Paradoxically, these control RNA template preparations may introduce artifacts which are not present in actual experimental or clinical samples. For example, traces of plasmid DNA, obviously containing strands of both positive and negative sense, virtually always contaminate RNAs which are transcribed in vitro by conventional protocols; in this case, strand specificity cannot be demonstrated since control reagents themselves are contaminated by sequences of the \u2018wrong\u2019 sense. In order to overcome this problem, it is essential after in vitro transcription of RNA standards to digest the plasmid template with high concentrations of RNase-free DNase in a buffer containing Mn (Bauer et al., 1997) (Table 3). Conventional DNase treatments in Mg-containing buffers did not completely degrade plasmid DNA (data not shown). In our experience, when non-specific products are observed during ssRT-PCR, trouble shooting usually reveals that this artifact is caused by trace contamination of control RNA reagents by residual plasmid DNA. This problem may be corrected by either producing new batches of RNA standards or by repeated DNase treatment of existing RNA standards. Also, the conditions of our RT-PCR assay minimize the possibility of amplification of residual, contaminating plasmid DNA in two other ways. First, during the RT step at 48\u00b0C plasmid DNA templates are likely to remain double-stranded and thus are unavailable for amplification. Second, during the PCR step, only primers recognizing tag sequences introduced into prior products will prime Taq polymerase (Fig. 1); therefore, carryover plasmid DNA, having exclusively viral sequences and lacking tag sequences, will not be amplified.",

RNA should be isolated immediately, or tissues should be snap-frozen at \u221270\u00b0C. The stability of purified RNA can be maximized by storing stocks as one-use aliquots or as ethanol precipitants at \u221270\u00b0C in dilute NaCl and EDTA. Recent evidence suggests that optimum RNA storage may be achieved in a solution of 1 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.4 (Prediger, 1998). Another essential assay parameter is the institution of a hot start for the PCR, either by means of a heating block (Mullis, 1991) or a wax tab (Perkin Elmer; Chou, et al., 1992), in order to avoid non-specific products which result from priming at low temperatures.",

However, improved methodology and rigorous control of reactions have permitted unambiguous quantitative PCR and RT-PCR determinations with good correspondence to values obtained with established standard methods, such as Northern blot (Wang et al., 1989, Yokoi et al., 1993). In fact, the reliability of RT-PCR and similar techniques is such that quantitative assays have been approved for routine clinical use, for example, in determining HIV-1 mRNA levels in patients during antiretroviral chemotherapy (Saag, 1997). In this regard, once the ssRT-PCR assay was optimized, it was relatively straightforward to extend the method to quantitative determinations by adding competitor RNA templates to the reactions. Relative to viral sequences, such competitor RNAs have identical primer binding sites but contain a small deletion which allows specific products generated from these templates to be distinguished on sizing gels. The power of competitive RT-PCR assays is derived from the fact that the sample and competitor RNA templates are amplified in the same reaction tube under identical conditions. Assaying both templates in one tube eliminates sources of error which may occur when control and experimental templates are amplified in separate tubes and subsequently compared to each other.",

In our assays of coronavirus RNA by qssRT-PCR, we have found that both the equimolar format and standard curve format work well and have similar sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and practicability (data not shown). We have found it easiest to use the qssRT-PCR in the equimolar mode during initial experiments, when the magnitude of expected coronavirus RNA concentration is unknown. By contrast, the standard curve method has been most convenient at later stages of experiments, when the approximate range of coronavirus RNA concentrations may be anticipated and many replicate samples in this range must be analyzed. Since equimolar and standard curve methods utilize the same reagents and procedures, and differ only in the format in which competitions are conducted, it is easy to switch between these two modes of analysis.",

The sense and quantity of any viral RNA may be reliably determined if strict attention is given to controls and to the methodological points listed in Table 3. The assay has been demonstrated to have excellent sensitivity, specificity, and precision, with almost no interference by irrelevant or opposite-sense RNAs. It is more difficult to assess the accuracy, defined as freedom from systematic analytical error or correspondence to a true value (Rock, 1994), of the qssRT-PCR assay we have presented, especially when purified, exactly-quantified standards of genuine viral RNA are not available. The experiments presented demonstrate reasonably accurate assay performance with a variety of conditions and standards, including competitions against RNA obtained during viral infection in vitro. We suspect that the degree of inaccuracy observed, particularly in the case of negative sense N-wt determinations, is due principally to small errors in measuring the concentrations of our initial RNA template stock solutions. In many applications it may be sufficient to determine if a given viral RNA species is increasing or decreasing relative to a baseline or standard value during the course of an experiment. If, on the other hand, it is essential to know the concentration of a viral RNA in absolute terms, for example, to rigorously determine the average number of viral genomes per infected cell, then additional efforts must be made to precisely measure the concentration of competitor RNA standards, followed by careful titration of these standards in competitions against actual viral RNAs under realistic experimental conditions.",
