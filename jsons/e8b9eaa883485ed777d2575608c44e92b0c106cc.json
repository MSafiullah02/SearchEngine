We trained a multi-view fusion model using deep learning network to screen patients with COVID-19 using CT images with the maximum lung regions in axial, coronal and sagittal views.

However, it has the nature of time consuming and high false negative [3] . Thus, it is urgent to find an effective and accurate method to screen COVID- 19 . Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a critical tool in the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia. Shi et al. studied the CT image data of 81 COVID-19 pneumonia patients and found that in problem, deep learning can achieve human-level accuracy, such as in pulmonary nodules diagnosis [6] , breast cancer diagnosis [7] , retina image segmentation [8] , etc. In clinical applications of lung diseases, Coudray et al. studied the use of pathological images of lung cancer tissues to predict lung cancer subtypes and gene mutations [9] . They trained the deep learning network inceptionV3 to establish prediction models, and achieved good performance in independent validation sets. Wang et al. used CT image data from lung regions to predict EGFR gene mutations using an end-to-end deep learning network, and achieved the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the validation set of 241 cases [10] . Hence, the deep learning-based methods can be used to assist radiologists to improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we aimed to train a diagnostic model based on deep learning network on the chest CT images to screen the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The dataset and demographic characteristics of patients are detailed in Table 1. The chest examinations were performed with a CT scanner (Optima CT680, GE Medical Systems, USA;) in RHWU. The CT protocol was as follows: tube voltage, 120 kVp; tube current, 249mA; and mAs, 108.7. The images were acquired at lung (window width, 1500 HU; window level, -750 HU) settings. For patients in the 1 st HCMU, the examinations were performed with a CT scanner (Discovery, CT750 HD, GE Medical Systems, USA). The CT parameter was set as: tube voltage, 120 kVp; tube current, 219mA; and mAs, 95.6. The images were acquired at mediastinal (window width, 250 HU; window level, 40 HU) settings.",

As previous study of chest CT images has shown that images from multiple views can contribute to learning more useful information without introducing more redundant information [6] . To predict the classification of lung nodules by CT images, a multi-view deep learning model of lung nodules classification study showed good performance. Thus, we trained our deep learning network using the CT images from axial, coronal, and sagittal views of the lung regions for developing the diagnosis model to screen the COVID-19.",

During the training phase, the validation set of three-view images were used to optimize the hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

For these four patients, their risk scores with COVID-19 infections are 0.801, 0.461, 0.946, and 0.315 (range from 0-1), which were evaluated by the multi-view deep learning fusion model. In this study, we took the cut-off of the model as 0.653, according to Youden index. Normally, it takes more than ten minutes to examine the CT images of on patient and to identify the COVID-19 infected patient by a trained radiologist.

It is important to note that most of patients with COVID-19 are more likely to have CT abnormalities characterized by bilateral and subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO), vascular thickening, spider web, and crazy-paving patterns [19] [20] [21] , while patients with other pneumonia mainly show patchy or density increasing shadows [22] . The advanced AI-based algorithms can discriminate COVID-19 from other pneumonia by learning not only these typical CT image signs, but also some highdimensional features, such as texture, wavelet information etc., which are unable processed by radiologists. Consequently, these deep learning-based studies showed significant effect on the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia through CT images. However, due to the small datasets and less than two centers were involved in these studies, the CT slices were taken as samples for developing deep learning model, resulting in inter-slice fusion and time cost issues. In addition, the generalization performance on multicentre data remains to be verified. Here, we utilized the information from the automatic segmentation of multi-view of CT images to train our deep learning network, which avoided the heavy workload of manually sketching the features in CT images of patients with pneumonia by the radiologists. Therefore, we could take one patient as a sample, which means that one patient only needs to be tested once. In this study, we established and verified the performance of the multi-view deep learning fusion model on 495 multi-center data. Our results further demonstrated that our model has the great potential to be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.",
