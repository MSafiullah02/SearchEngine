Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum pNfH concentration in 219 MND patients consecutively enrolled in our tertiary MND clinic. A multifactorial analysis was carried out to investigate the major clinical determinants of serum pNfH. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were performed to explore the prognostic value of serum pNfH. Serum pNfH levels were not homogenous among MND phenotypes; higher concentrations in pyramidal, bulbar, and classic phenotypes were observed. C9orf72-MND exhibited higher pNfH concentrations compared to non-C9orf72 MND. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed mean MEP/cMAP and disease progression rate as the two major predictors of serum pNfH levels (R 2 = 0.188; p \u2264 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference of survival among MND subgroups when divided into quartiles based on pNfH concentrations, log-rank X 2 = 53.0, p \u2264 0.0001. Our study evidenced that higher serum pNfH concentration is a negative independent prognostic factor for survival. In Cox multivariate model, pNfH concentration showed the highest hazard ratio compared to the other factors influencing survival included in the analysis. pNfH differs among the MND phenotypes and is an independent prognostic factor for survival. This study provides supporting evidence of the role of pNfH as useful prognostic biomarker for MND patients.

In our large cohort of MND patients, well characterized by several clinical parameters, we found that serum pNfH concentration was not homogenous among the MND phenotypes. Moreover, we demonstrated serum pNfH to be an independent predictive factor of survival in MND patients. Indeed, pyramidal, bulbar, and classic phenotypes exhibited higher pNfH levels compared to MND patients with a selective LMN or UMN involvement. The positive correlation between pNfH and the progression rate suggests that a faster degeneration of the motor system is one of the determinants of serum pNfH concentration, explaining the lower levels detected in slow progressive phenotypes as PUMN, PLMN, and FA. We found an inverse correlation between pNfH and MEP/cMAP suggesting that an elevated UMN burden might influence the serum pNfH concentration. Although the explanation is probably more complex, our results suggest that a rapid ongoing degeneration process of the UMN/corticospinal tract might be related to an increase of the serum pNfH concentration. However, MEP/cMAP does not selectively estimate UMN impairment and it might be influenced by both central and peripheral motor conductions; therefore, experimental neurophysiological methods such as short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) or advanced MRI investigations are needed to confirm this correlation. Consistent with this hypothesis, previous studies reported that serum NfL levels were higher in ALS patients with a widespread UMN involvement and correlated with MRI measures of corticospinal tract degeneration, while NfL were lower in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) patients [18, 35] . Notably, we observed significantly higher serum pNfH levels in C9orf72 MND patients compared to non-C9orf72 MND, in line with a previous study, which detected higher CSF pNfH levels in C9orf72 MND carriers [33] . C9orf72 MND has a faster disease progression rate and shorter survival [6] , reflecting a widespread CNS neurodegeneration and more severe brain atrophy even involving extra motor areas compared to non-C9orf72 MND [34] . We investigated serum pNfH levels among the cognitive phenotypes, classified according to the Strong criteria [30] . Although MND patients with a concurrence of cognitive dysfunction and/ or FTD showed higher median pNfH levels compared to MND patients with normal cognition and behavior, this difference did not reach a statistical significance, suggesting that extra-motor areas involvement may not be a major Fig. 1 Serum pNfH in MND patients.

The median concentrations, 25% and 75% percentile and range values are given. pNfH levels are plotted on a 10-logarithmic scale determinant of the serum pNfH concentration in MND patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm our result. In support of our data, a previous study has shown higher CSF pNfH levels in ALS-FTD compared with FTD patients without evidence of motor system involvement, suggesting that the motor system involvement is the major determinant of pNfH concentrations [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1723, "end": 1727, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1731, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1944, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2021, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2165, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2282, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2758, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2886, "end": 2890, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2997, "end": 3001, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3538, "end": 3542, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2580, "end": 2586, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While serum and CSF pNfH concentrations were previously correlated with survival parameters in univariate analysis, our study showed that serum pNfH concentration is a negative independent prognostic factor for survival through an accurate multivariate analysis [19] . Indeed, patients with higher pNfH concentration showed a significantly shorter median survival. Serum pNfH concentration showed the highest hazard ratio compared to all the other factors influencing survival included in the Cox multivariate model. Additionally, we showed that serum pNfH concentration was also significant as independent negative factor to predict the time to reach King's stage 4, i.e., the time to reach feeding or respiratory failure, which requires specific clinical interventions. Patients in King's stages 3 and 4 showed higher serum pNfH concentration compared to patients in King's stages 1 and 2. These findings suggest that pNfH levels in serum indicate the spreading and the global rate of CNS involvement and may offer a quick and simple measure to assess and predict neuronal damage in MND.

Furthermore, a prognostic blood-based biomarker would be preferable to a CSF biomarker to avoid an invasive practice such as the lumbar puncture.
