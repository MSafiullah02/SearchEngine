            "text": "Hypersensitivity syndromes are a heterogeneous family of disorders mediated by immunologic mechanisms in response to foreign proteins, most commonly drugs and infectious agents. Four types of hypersensitivity reactions have been described: immunoglobulin E\u2010mediated (type I), cytotoxic or antibody\u2010mediated (type II), immune complex\u2010mediated (type III), and delayed\u2010type (type IV). Following sensitization during an initial exposure, re\u2010exposure to the antigen elicits an excessive immune response, resulting in the cutaneous and systemic signs and symptoms that characterize the hypersensitivity syndromes.1 An underlying genetic predisposition is theorized to increase an individual's risk to such processes. The presentation of these conditions can be distinct in the infant population. While many of these diseases are benign and self\u2010limited, they must be distinguished from disorders with systemic implications. Clinical presentations can often be characteristic; however, overlapping features of many of these conditions may pose a diagnostic dilemma. Dermatologists are critical members of the health care team with the expertise to recognize and differentiate these unusual syndromes. This case presentation and review provides an overview and update of the clinical findings, etiologies, histopathology, management, and complications of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions in infants (Tables 1 and 2). A brief summary of severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions is included, but an exhaustive review of these conditions is outside of the scope of this review.",

Despite the dramatic appearance and rapid onset of the rash, fever tends to be low grade and patients are often well appearing, though some are irritable. Extracutaneous manifestations are rare, but renal, gastrointestinal, and joint involvement has been reported.3 Laboratory findings in AHEI are generally nonspecific, though elevated inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia may be present. Histopathology shows features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a mixed infiltrate of neutrophils and eosinophils; direct immunofluorescence studies are typically negative. AHEI resolves within several weeks with supportive care alone, and rarely recurs.4\n",

The incidence of KD is higher in some ethnic groups, such as Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans, supporting a genetic susceptibility. KD peaks in incidence between 13 and 24 months of age. Diagnosis requires fever for at least 5 days accompanied by four of the following signs: bilateral conjunctivitis, oral mucous membrane changes, peripheral extremity changes, polymorphous rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Acral findings may include erythema, edema, and desquamation (typically delayed), and oral involvement is characterized by mucosal erythema, swollen or fissured lips, and a prominent red tongue. Features of the generalized rash are highly variable, including urticarial, scarlatiniform, morbilliform, and dermatitic morphologies (Figure 3).10 Atypical KD and incomplete KD, forms that are more common in infants, may deviate from the classic presentation, thus requiring a high index of suspicion in this population.11\n",

AAU is thought to result from an allergic hypersensitivity reaction that may be IgE dependent or independent, in association with infection, medication, or immunization.20 Patients present with polycyclic and annular edematous pink plaques often with violaceous centers, affecting the trunk, face, and extremities (Figure 5). Edema of the face, hands, and feet is particularly prominent in infants. Patients usually complain of itch, and the condition may be accompanied by fever or dermatographism. As with typical urticaria, individual skin lesions tend to resolve within 24 hours, while there may be ongoing eruption of new lesions for 1\u20102 weeks. Histology is similar to that of acute urticaria, demonstrating dermal edema and sparse perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of neutrophils and eosinophils. AAU can be differentiated from EM by the presence of pruritus rather than pain, the absence of skin necrosis and blistering, and transient nature of individual lesions.20 Management of the eruption is achieved with systemic antihistamines; evaluation for a precipitating infectious source is warranted and any implicated medications should be discontinued.

In the infant population, DIHS/DRESS occurs almost exclusively in the context of antiepileptic therapy.41 Skin findings are characterized by facial edema and a pruritic, diffuse rash of variable morphology including morbilliform, pustular, scarlatiniform, urticarial, targetoid, or full erythroderma; mucosal involvement is typically mild, in contrast to SJS/TEN.42 The histopathology of DIHS/DRESS is nonspecific.43 Visceral manifestations appear 2\u20106 weeks after onset, with hepatitis being the most common, and thyroid dysfunction presenting as a later sequela.44 In addition to discontinuation of the inciting medication, systemic corticosteroids historically have comprised the mainstay of treatment, but recent work suggests topical steroids may be effective and sufficient in patients with limited disease.45\n",

The pustules resolve with prominent desquamation.46 Very few cases have been reported in infants and pustular psoriasis should be strongly considered as an alternative diagnosis. AGEP may be precipitated by medications (most commonly antibiotics), infection, or vaccination.47 Histopathology is characterized by neutrophil exocytosis, pustules, papillary dermal edema, and a neutrophilic and eosinophilic dermal infiltrate.46 Management consists of removal of the offending drug and supportive care, with resolution in 4\u201010 days. Topical steroid therapy has also been reported as beneficial in affected infants.47\n",

As there is much overlap in clinical presentation, accurate diagnosis is facilitated by recognizing the similarities and differences between these entities. While many of these conditions are benign and self\u2010limited, others may have serious consequences, and early diagnosis is essential to improving outcomes. Evaluation for an inciting infection should be undertaken when appropriate, given the relatively immunocompromised state of young infants and the likelihood that many of these entities may be triggered by infectious agents. However, the adverse effects of overly aggressive systemic therapy may outweigh more limited potential benefits, and accurate diagnosis will spare unnecessary investigations and treatment. The dermatologist will play a critical role in providing the expertise necessary to recognize these rare syndromes and confirming uncertain diagnoses via skin biopsy when indicated. Further work remains to be done, particularly in the infant population, to better understand pathophysiology and optimize management of these rare conditions.",
