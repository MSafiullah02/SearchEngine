Animals studied Six adult female cats and the offspring from seven litters. Methods Four kittens from uninfected specific pathogen-free (SPF) queens and 21 kittens from SPF queens inoculated at various times late in gestation with Mozart, Maggie, or ME-49 strain of T. gondii were used. Ocular examinations were performed on queens prior to and after delivery, and on kittens weekly to bi-weekly for up to 27 weeks. Whole blood for serology was collected from all kittens at 5 1 / 2 to 8 weeks of age and again at 12 weeks of age or later. Results No kittens from noninfected queens developed ocular lesions or antibody to T. gondii . Three of the 24 kittens from infected queens died or were euthanized early in the study. Chorioretinitis was detected in 15 of 21 living kittens from infected queens. Two developed concurrent anterior uveitis that resolved within 1 week. Posterior segment lesions varied ophthalmoscopically between strains. Of 21 kittens from T. gondiiinfected queens, six developed positive antibody titers to T. gondii during the study. All seropositive kittens were born to queens infected with Mozart strain of T. gondii . Conclusion Results of this study suggest that ocular toxoplasmosis can occur without other evidence of clinical illness in kittens infected in utero or in the neonatal period, and that T. gondii strains may have varying degrees of ocular pathogenicity in cats.",

            "text": "The protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii , commonly infects both cats and humans. In humans, infection by T. gondii rarely causes noticeable clinical disease unless the person is immune suppressed or infected in utero . 1 T. gondii infection in cats is usually subclinical, although clinical disease has been well documented in both kittens and adults. 2 Cats with disseminated organism replication resulting in clinical toxoplasmosis usually have multiple organ involvement that commonly includes the eyes. In naturally infected cats with disseminated toxoplasmosis, the organism has been detected in association with inflammation in the retina, optic nerve, choroid, ciliary body, and iris. 3 The prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in cats that have no other evidence of clinical disease is difficult to estimate because the diagnosis is difficult to confirm. Serum antibodies against T. gondii have been detected in as many as 74.2% 4 of cats with uveitis as the primary clinical complaint. However, up to 53.4% of healthy cats are positive as well. 5 Thus, detection of serum antibodies cannot be used alone to document ocular toxoplasmosis. Using aqueous humor antibody testing has a better predictive value than serum antibody testing, but results do not always correlate to ocular toxoplasmosis in individual cats. 6, 7 While the organism is commonly found in the eyes of cats with fatal, disseminated toxoplasmosis, 3 ocular histopathology rarely identifies the organism in the eyes of cats with uveitis only. 8 It has been suggested that uveitis in cats that are otherwise healthy might occur as a result of exposure to Toxoplasma antigens at nonocular locations. 9 However, T. gondii DNA has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the aqueous humor of naturally exposed and experimentally infected cats, confirming that the organism reaches the eye. 10, 11 It is clear from serologic studies, aqueous humor antibody studies, and aqueous humor PCR studies that cats with uveitis commonly have been exposed to T. gondii , but it is unclear why some cats develop ocular disease and others do not.",

The infecting stage of the organism (tachyzoite, oocyst, cyst) may also be important. Ingestion of tachyzoites, the form most likely found in milk, was previously thought not to cause clinical disease, even in neonates. 2, 14 Queens in this study were infected with cysts, late in gestation, in order to minimize clinical illness in the kittens. Transplacental infection has been shown to occur in queens infected as late as 13 days prior to parturition, but may not in queens infected later in pregnancy. 14 Three queens in the present study were infected 1, 5, and 8 days before parturition.

However, most of the kittens that were allowed to live were clinically ill and died or were euthanized within 8 days of age, although a few remained clinically normal until euthanasia at between 8 and 98 days of age. 13, 14 Strain ME-49 was used to infect the queens of those studies and may be related to the high kitten mortality rate. ME-49 was used to infect only queen 3 in this study. Queen 3 was inoculated 5 days before and died 7 days after parturition. Because the queen was inoculated so late in gestation, infection in the kittens was more likely through ingestion of milk rather than transplacentally. The number of ingested organisms via suckling might have also been decreased because the kittens were hand reared after the queen's death.",

As all kittens were allowed to suckle from infected queens, it is impossible to determine if infection in these kittens occurred transplacentally or through ingestion of milk. Infection of some kittens by ingestion of oocysts from feces or from the perianal area of the infected queen or littermates is also possible but less likely as feces were removed daily before oocysts had time to sporulate and the number of organisms retained in the perianal area is likely to be small. Infection from direct contact with other excretions has not been documented. 19 Differences were found in kittens from queens infected with the Mozart strain of T. gondii compared to kittens from differences may be related to other factors. The kittens from the ME-49-infected queen were hand reared after 1 week of age, and so organism ingestion may have been less than kittens from the other litters. Parasite load could also influence development of ocular disease. Why kittens from queens infected with ME-49 and Maggie strains of T. gondii developed chorioretinitis consistent with ocular toxoplasmosis but failed to produce detectable levels of antibodies to T. gondii is unknown. It is possible that a low parasite load could result in antibody levels below the threshold of detection by the assays used and could also explain why lesions were small and few in all but one kitten. T. gondii has been isolated from congenitally infected rats that have remained seronegative, 20 and detection of antibodies in mice can be dependent on the infecting strain of T. gondii. 21 Similarly, route of infection and infecting strain may influence titer development of kittens. For humane reasons, none of the seronegative kittens with ocular disease were euthanized for bioassay or histopathology to confirm T. gondii infection. Thus, it is also possible that the ocular lesions were due to another cause and the kittens were not infected with T. gondii. This seems unlikely, however, as none of the control kittens developed similar lesions, the kittens were kept isolated in a controlled environment, and the queens were documented to be infected by T. gondii.",

Most cats become infected with Toxoplasma after weaning, by eating tissue cysts in prey animals. If neonatally infected cats are more likely to develop ocular toxoplasmosis, this may help to explain why so many cats in nature are infected but so few develop ocular toxoplasmosis. Results of this study also support the suggestion that some T. gondii strains are oculotropic. With the exception of one kitten, posterior segment lesions in kittens infected with ME-49 and Maggie strains were less severe than those in kittens infected with the Mozart strain. Although the role strain played in development of ocular disease in this study is not clear because of the small number of litters studied, and the variations in protocol between litters, our results support a recent study of adult cats orally inoculated with ME-49, Maggie, and Mozart cysts, where ocular lesions were detected in one of seven cats, one of five cats and three of five cats, respectively, suggesting strain may be important in development of ocular disease (Lappin MR, unpublished data).",
