A recent systematic review identified taxonomy of Twitter as a tool for health research, including content analysis, surveillance, engagement, recruitment, intervention, and network analysis [5]. Prior research found Twitter users engaged in communication pertinent to infectious diseases, such as Ebola [6,7], measles [8], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [9], and Zika [10,11]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages the strategic use of Twitter to disseminate CDC health information and engage with individuals and partners [12]. CDC uses Twitter as part of their overall health communication strategies [13,14], uses Twitter chats to engage Twitter users on specific health topics [15-17], and publicizes public health events and publications via Twitter [18].",

Negative binomial regression models were used, as the retweet frequency was overdispersed. Negative binomial regression models took into account data points that were zeros. Hurdle models that take into account the excess of zeros (because many tweets did not have any retweet) were also attempted. A hurdle model is a model with 2 components: (1) a hurdle component for zero versus positive counts and (2) a truncated count component for positive counts [23]. In our hurdle models, the default binomial distribution (logistic regression) was used for the hurdle component; a truncated negative binomial distribution was chosen for the count component, given the overdispersion of the data.",

            "text": "In this study, we focused on the effect of attaching images or videos to tweets on their retweet frequency, in particular, tweets tweeted by @CDC_AMD. According to Soboleva and colleagues [26], images can increase the effect of advertisements partly because they can convey meanings not expressed via words. In their literature review, Soboleva et al [26] also highlighted that images can influence consumer persuasion, have the potential to effect attitude change, and increase recall of advertisements\u2019 verbal information. Prior studies on the effect of links to visual cues on retweet frequency using Twitter data collected in 2011 had conflicting results [27,28]. Analyzing tweets associated with tourism in European cities, Bruni et al [27] found that tweets with a link to a photo or a video had more retweets than those without, and tweets linking to a photo had more retweets than tweets linking to a video. On the contrary, Malhotra et al [28] could not identify statistically significant effect of embedded links to websites, photos, or videos on retweet likelihood of tweets tweeted by 47 major commercial brands. However, another study that analyzed tweets from 2009 to 2012, drawn from 298 Twitter profiles operated by 100 top brands, found that links to photos or videos increased the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted [29]. A more recent study analyzing 2014 Twitter data posted by 32 major commercial brands found that photos were consistently associated with higher retweet rates across 3 industries under study (automobile, fast-moving consumer goods, and luxury) [26]. Nevertheless, the same study found that the industry of the brand was an effect modifier for the effect of videos on retweet rates (significant increase in retweet probability for luxury brands, but insignificant effect for the other 2 industries) [26]. Similar research on Sina Weibo (a Chinese social media platform similar to Twitter) also found that multimedia Weibo posts received more reposts, and were reposted by users for a longer period of time, than text-only Weibo posts [30]. In a retrospective observational study, the effect of attaching visual cues to a tweet on its retweet frequency was found to vary across cycles of original tweets with hashtags #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns. The probability ratios of retweet frequency of tweets with visual cues as compared to tweets without visual cues ranged from less than 1 to as high as 34, depending on the topic of the specific CDC Grand Round event or Vital Signs publication [31]. In a prospective, case-control crossover study of visual abstracts (graphics that summarize the main message of a scientific paper), a surgical journal found that the retweet frequency of its tweet that carries both the title of the paper and a visual abstract was 8.4 times that of a tweet with the title of the paper only (92 vs 11 retweets, P<.001) [32]. Further evidence was provided by Can et al who identified certain features of an image that were positively correlated with retweet count [25]. Consistent with prior findings, this study on @CDC_AMD adds evidence to a growing literature that attaching visual cues to tweets will increase their retweet frequency, and this practice may enhance Twitter users\u2019 engagement with health communication messages promoted by medical and public health professionals.",

The strength of this study is that we manually coded and statistically analyzed the entire corpus of tweets published by @CDC_AMD. Although our study follows the protocol defined a priori, it lacks the ability to classify 55% of the followers and 80% of contents retweeted by @CDC_AMD that did not fall into any of the prespecified categories. Further research on the followers is warranted. We select retweet frequency as our measure of engagement of a tweet, while acknowledging its limitations. We acknowledge that other measures of impact exist, including \u201creach,\u201d defined as the sum of the potential number of individuals exposed to each retweet of a tweet. While \u201creach\u201d may account for the number of followers who retweeted a tweet, retweeting is a high level of engagement, and retweet frequency provides solid evidence to our research questions. We did not distinguish videos from photos when we manually coded the visual cues. Future research can further investigate the difference in effect between these 2 types of visual cues for a public health Twitter handle, as compared with results for Twitter handles of major commercial brands [26]. We also did not analyze specific visual features of the photos or videos (as in [25]) that were beyond the scope of our study. There were other potential confounders or effect modifiers [26] that were not included in our study. Given the nature of this study as an observational study, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding by other factors.",
