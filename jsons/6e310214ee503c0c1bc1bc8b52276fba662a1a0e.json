A significantly different mutational profile at CDS sites that are not 4-fold degenerate is consistent with contemporaneous selection against T mutations more widely. Although selection against CpG dinucleotides is expected to drive synonymous site G+C content below mutational equilibrium, observed G+C content is slightly above equilibrium, possibly because of selection for higher expression. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily informed gene-bespoke approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against",

Similarly, selection on synonymous sites causes coadaptation between codon usage and tRNA pools (Ikemura 1981; Higgs and Ran 2008) , which can increase gene expression through a recently discovered mechanism that involves the recognition of slowly translated codons by a dedicated mRNA degradation pathway (Buschauer, et al. 2020) . The effects of modification of synonymous site nucleotides are not modest: modulation of RNA structures, synonymous site GC content or codon-tRNA adaptation alters protein levels in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells by orders of magnitude (Gustafsson, et al. 2004; Kudla, et al. 2009; Fath, et al. 2011; Bentele, et al. 2013; Mordstein, et al. 2020) .",

In this instance, we aim to discern how selection acts on synonymous sites with a view to engineering the virus against the direction favoured by selection. In particular, viral attenuation can be achieved by alteration of synonymous sites as a means to modify the pattern of dinucleotides that bridge between successive codons (alias codon pair bias) while retaining the original protein (Karlin, et al. 1994; Rima and McFerran 1997; Coleman, et al. 2008) . The same strategy has been extended to bacterial vaccines (Coleman, et al. 2011) . Attenuation via modification of many synonymous sites has the notable advantage that any such virus employed as a vaccine will likely need many mutations to acquire wild-type fitness. Such a strategy is thus likely to be robust to virus/vaccine intra-host evolution. Indeed, given the mutation rate of SARS-COV2 (about 1 mutation every two weeks) this not a concern as regards intra-host adaptation by the virus. Synonymous codon manipulation has thus been proposed as a viable strategy for SARS-CoV2 attenuation and vaccine production (e.g. Kames, et al. 2020) .",

This is very likely to relate to the activity of the human Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) as this targets transcripts with high CpG content (Takata, et al. 2017; Ficarelli, et al. 2020) , although it is by no means the only antiviral peptide (Supplementary Table 1 ). As might be expected, ZAP is under positive selection owing to host-parasite coevolution (Kerns, et al. 2008 ). This suggests a simple attenuation strategy for SARS-CoV2, i.e. to increase CpG content (Kames, et al. 2020) , this being consistent with the observed low CpG enrichment of the virus as sequenced in the wild (Xia 2020) , also seen in cytoplasmic viruses more generally (Simmonds, et al. 2013) . TpA is commonly considered alongside CpG not least because both are under-represented in native human transcripts (Simmonds, et al. 2013) . Similarly, viruses lacking CpG also tend not to have TpA and engineering increased CpG and TpA attenuates viruses (Simmonds, et al. 2013) . TpA depletion in SARS-CoV2 is weaker than CpG depletion (see below).",

If there is selection against CpG residues, then we expect this to be evidenced as reduced G+C content at synonymous third sites, as mutation at third sites is least likely to have deleterious pleiotropic effects (e.g. via altering the amino acid specified). A codon with a C at position two selects for avoidance of G at the third site, while a codon starting with G selects for avoidance of C at the 5' codon's 3 rd site.

For example, bacteria show a common GC->AT mutational bias (Hershberg and Petrov 2010) , and hence a deviation from equilibrium in GC rich bacteria (Hildebrand, et al. 2010) . Similarly, nonequilibrium TA nucleotide skews (Charneski, et al. 2011 ) have been identified. A recent large survey indicated that G+C deviating from neutral equilibria is common within eukaryotes (Long, et al. 2018) . To derive this conclusion Lynch and colleagues extracted, from mutation accumulation (MA) experiments or parent-offspring sequencing, mutational profiles for numerous species and showed that the observed G+C content, even at codon third sites, was commonly higher than expected under a purely neutral model (Long, et al. 2018) . The cause of this is unresolved, although GC biased gene conversion is one possible explanation (Long, et al. 2018) . The possible importance of this process is supported by the widespread observation of a G+C-recombination correlation (Pessia, et al. 2012) , implying higher GC in domains of more common double strand break repair. The case is by no means closed, however, as evidence for higher recombination in domains of manipulated high GC (Marsolier-Kergoat and Yeramian 2009; Kiktev, et al. 2018 ) and absence of GC:AT bias during gene conversion in organisms with a G+C recombination correlation (Liu, et al. 2018) , both suggest the direction of the causative arrow may in some cases be reversed.",

With very common sequencing (in all cases, short time periods between ancestor and progeny) we can ignore the possibility of multiple sequential hits at the same site (with the first hits going unsequenced) contaminating the mutational matrix. In principle the method can be misled by strong selection purging, in a nonrandom fashion, mutations prior their appearing in the population. However, if most selection is weak purifying selection there is then a lag between a deleterious mutation appearing (and being sequenced) and it being purged from a population. Declines in Ka/Ks as time to common ancestry increases in closely related bacteria strains (Rocha, et al. 2006) is consistent with such a model. In principle, even if there is strong selection on some mutations this too need not be problematic, so long as the profile of the mutations subject to strong selection is itself unbiased. Here then we apply this method to SARS-CoV2. To be cautious we consider only \"high quality\" mutations at four-fold degenerate sites to define the \"cleanest\" mutational matrix. We show that employment of mutations at all CDS sites makes a small but detectable difference, indicative of contemporaneous selection prior to sequencing on non-synonymous variants.",

This is consistent with selection for raised G+C content but data suggest the more profound effect is selection against T content, as both T3 and TT we find to be far below their mutational equilibria. Regarding the rationale of any possible selection, we observe, even with a very underpowered test, a correlation between gene body nucleotide content and gene expression level that is suggestive of some expression mediated mode of selection.

Classically we presume selection dominates over mutation bias and so to design highly expressed genes one selects for the common codons assuming them to be the most optimal. In this instance, a parsimonious interpretation of the data is that the mutation bias is so strong that selection has been unable to fully counter its effects, leaving a sub-optimal (selected against) nucleotide (T) the most commonplace. Given our results we thus propose the unusual strategy of increasing the usage of the already most highly used residue so as to degrade performance of the virus. Put differently, assuming selection acts against T and TT, a simple method to increase CpG content may not be the optimal strategy for viral attenuation. Given that prior evidence indicated that selection for reduced CpG content is particular to just immediate early genes (Lin, et al. 2020) , we ask whether all SARS-CoV2 genes are equally subject to CpG bias. We find that they are not. Given this we propose a gene-bespoke approach sensitive to both CpG and putative selection on synonymous site T. Our results come with at least four caveats: that we cannot eliminate recently altered mutational biases, that we cannot address non-selective fixation biases, that sequencing errors may impact the mutational matrix and that we can only assume, but not demonstrate, that recent mutations observed at 4fold degenerate sites are an unbiased reflection of the mutational process.",

A priori by virtue of the fact that they are homoplasic we might suppose that mutational activity at these sites is not reflective of the mutational profile elsewhere in the genome and it is the equilibrium properties of other sites that we are interested in. One could then opt to filter out mutations at homoplasic sites considering them possibly unrepresentative.

To this end, we randomly extracted without replacement 972 mutations from the full set of mutations so as to create a subsample of pseudo '4-folds'. The remaining 4672 mutations we then considered a sample of pseudo 'non 4fold' mutations. For each randomization, we assembled the corresponding mutational matrix, solved for equilibria and calculated the Euclidean distance between the resulting vectors of predicted equilibrium for the four nucleotides.

More generally, T content whether derived from mononucleotides at 4-fold third sites (predicted 64.6%) or mononucleotides across the genes (predicted 59%) or from dinucleotides (62%) is greatly in excess of T content this being 32% for the complete viral sequence.

We notice that CpG content is above that expected under neutrality ( Figure 2 ).

To ask whether the difference between the two equilibria solutions is significantly different, we developed a non-parametric Monte Carlo simulation (Methods). We find that the Euclidean distances from the random sampling are the same as, or greater than, the Euclidean distance between four-folds and non-four fold sites in just 390/10,000 cases (hence P = 0.039) (repeating using an alternative distance metric, sum of modular difference between equilibria, make no meaningful difference, P=0.4).

Note that while CpG counts are likely to be necessarily higher as GC3 goes up, CpG enrichment is normalised to underlying GC content and so CpG enrichment and high GC3 are not logically coupled (e.g. if at the limit 50% of residues are C and 50% G, so long as CpG usage is random, CpG = 0.5*0.5, CpG enrichment will not be seen).",

There are several possible mechanistic explanations for the GC3 > GC3* effect.

Using mean GC of all viruses within a taxonomic grouping we observe this to be the case (Mann Whitney U test P=1.6 10 -20 , Fig 9) . CpG enrichment and TpA enrichment is similarly lower in cytoplasmic viruses (Fig 9) .

Broadly the T enrichment at third sites within the genome is then compatible with a large role for mutation bias, possibly mediated by APOBEC (Simmonds 2020) . However, we have shown that nucleotide usage, while skewed in the direction imposed by mutation bias, is nonetheless deviant from it. The difference between observed and expected T3 and TT (Fig 2) proportions are noteworthy. At four fold degenerate sites while C and G usage are close to equilibrium, A is far above and T is far below (T4=50.8%, T4*=64.6%; A4 = 28.95%, A4* = 18.93; C4 = 13.70%, C4* =12.28; G4 = 6.50%, G4* = 4.19%.). We propose that a parsimonious explanation is that the sizeable mutation bias towards T generates deleterious mutations, even at synonymous sites, and selection therefore favours reduced T content. However, increasing C or G potentially comes at a cost of increased CpG, so the base most in excess of its equilibrium is A. As a consequence, while CpG avoidance is real in some genes, GC3 is a little higher than predicted from the underlying mutational profile.",

H1N1, Ebola), but since the transfer to humans the mutational profile has altered. Were this so we may just have identified a lag in viral evolution from one neutral equilibrium to another. In this context deviation from equilibrium has little if anything to say about either selection or optimal vaccine design. While evidence for GC->AT biased mutation in related viruses (Simmonds 2020) renders this less parsimonious an explanation, direct examination of mutational profiles of the virus in its ancestral host (whatever that may be) would be valuable. The evidence for subtly but significantly different mutational matrixes dependent on the class of site employed provides more direct evidence for contemporary selection on T content throughout gene bodies that cannot be accounted for by a temporal shift in mutational profile.",

Evidence for a fixation bias need not necessarily indicate the direction of selection, as selection bias is only one class of fixation bias. In biased gene conversion, for example, the mismatch repair machinery recognises, during double strand break repair, heteroduplex GC:AT mismatches and corrects these in favour of GC residues (Brown and Jiricny 1988) . This causes a meiotic drive like process in which deleterious mutations can be driven to higher frequencies (for further consideration see Hurst 2019) . Given that single strand RNA cytoplasmic viruses, such as SARS-CoV2, are unlikely to be exposed to the nuclear mismatch repair machinery or need double strand break repair, biased gene conversion is unlikely to explain GC3>GC3*, T3<T3* etc.. We cannot with our data, however, rule out unknown mechanisms causing similar non-selective fixation biases. It is then valuable to provide more direct evidence for an advantageous effect of reduced T3/increased GC3, as suggested by our preliminary analysis on expression level.

Using high quality sequence, it was shown that using mutations that appear once and those that appear twice or more makes a significant difference to the matrix and estimates of equilibria (Charneski, et al. 2011) . The cause of this is likely to be a selection filter: mutations that persist longer to be sequenced twice or more will be skewed towards milder effect mutations.",

The ideal then is to filter not be regularity of appearance but by sequencing quality (hence our decisions on which sequences to employ: see Methods). Nonetheless, to err on the side of caution we considered mutations at 4-fold degenerate third sites that appear more than once (i.e. excluding singletons) and found that GC* is now even lower than previously predicted (GC*=10.3%, 95% bounds 10.11 -10.61). Thus, we are confident that we can exclude sequencing error as an explanation for observed GC3 > GC3* and T4<T4* (singleton excluded prediction of T4*=79.5%). Nonetheless, owing to observation bias and low sample size we caution against over-interpretation of this result.",

Unusually, even though T is the most common nucleotide at third sites (by a considerable margin), we propose increasing this even more thereby forcing the viruses against the direction of purifying selection. We predict that raising CpG in the genes that are CpG deficient would be a viable strategy even at a cost of raising GC3/lowering T. By contrast for those few genes with E(CpG)>1 (i.e. gene E, ORF10, see also Digard et al. (2020) ) CpG manipulation increasing GC3 would be a dangerous strategy, potentially achieving little more than an increase in expression. Increasing their AT content would appear to be the anti-selection direction. We note however that ORF10's function, if any remains, unclear there being no evidence of transcripts from it, despite it looking like a well formed ORF (starts ATG stops TAG, multiple of 3 long). Its GC3 content is also far from neutral equilibrium (GC3=36%). In this context gene E may be a good one to alter synonymous site usage as it appears not to be under selection for CpG or TpA avoidance.",
