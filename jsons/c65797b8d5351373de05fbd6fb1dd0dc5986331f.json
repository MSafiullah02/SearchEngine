Specifically, we are concerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga, which is currently -May 2020-stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model includes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined, which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or has undergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for the interaction dynamics of players, considering three different sources of infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleagues during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Our results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency of virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the end of the season. Following our findings, we finally present a variety of strategies to minimize the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the season of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.",

The virus first spread over different states in China before reaching other countries. On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, pointing to more than 118000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries around the world [1] . The evolution of the pandemic, which is (in May 2020) still affecting many countries worldwide, has been a matter of debate, since different strategies can be adopted to mitigate the spreading of COVID-19, some of them with unclear or unpredictable consequences. Due to the novelty of this unforeseen pandemic, the use of mathematical models is being extremely useful to predict the dynamics of the coronavirus spreading and the effects of different policies on the eventual reduction of the number of affected individuals.",

            "text": "Despite there are different approaches for modelling the pandemics, both continuous-time and discrete-time SIR-based models are probably the most extended approaches. The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model was first proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [2] , and consists of a compartmental model where individuals are split into three different states: (i) Susceptible (S), when they are sane, (ii) Infected (I), when they have the virus and (iii) Recovered (R). More sophisticated models include more possible states, such as Deceased (D) in the SIRD model [3] or Exposed (E) in the SEIR model [4] . The latter model has been extensively applied to describe the exponential growth of the number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, the effects of quarantine and confinement measures and, ultimately, to evaluate an adequate way of leaving confinement measures without increasing the risk of a second outbreak [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . For example, Peng et al. collected the epidemic data from five different Chinese regions and estimated the effects of the quarantine over all of them, forecasting the decrease of the number of infected individuals region by region [5] . On the other hand, Radulescu et al. introduced a compartmental model consisting of dividing the population into age groups and analyzing how the number of infected individuals was related to each age group. With this model, the effects of several social measures were simulated (closing campuses, schools or restaurants), showing different impacts at each age group [6] . Regarding the vast (and recent) scientific literature about the SEIR model applied to COVID-19, we can remark one of its significant merits: It can be easily adapted to describe a diversity of scenarios.",

The motivation behind our study is that there has been a lively debate about whether sports competitions that were not completed before the coronavirus crisis should be re-started or, ultimately, cancelled [12, 13, 15] . On the one hand, it is not the first time that epidemic diseases have threatened sports competition. For example, as pointed in [13] , the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil overlapped with a period in which Dengue risk was close to its maximum at three cities where matches were carried out [14] . Furthermore, attendants and players had to take special precautions due to Zika, a mosquito-transmitted disease. Despite the risks, the competition continued without significant problems regarding the number of individuals infected by Dengue or Zika. On the other hand, many voices have claimed that sports competitions should be canceled, not only for the high risk of athletes being infected during a competition but also due to the inability to be adequately treated in case of injury due to the saturation of hospitals [15] .",

Furthermore, we incorporated the use of tests to evaluate its consequences in identifying and confining those players that already have been infected.

Players can be in different states: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I) and Quarantined (Q). In case players are detected to be infected by the virus, they remain confined (indicated by the C suffix). After confinement, players undergo a quarantine before being eligible to play again. Parameters \u03b2 train , \u03b2 match and \u03b2 ext account for the probability of becoming Exposed (E) during training, matches or externally (player social circle) respectively. Probability \u03c3 describes the transition from Exposed to Infectious (I). Probability \u03b3 controls the transition from Infectious to Recovered (R) or Quarantined (Q). Finally, \u03b3 Q is related to the quarantine period a player must follow after recovery. Figure 1 represents a sketch of our discrete-time model. The time is discretised in days, and every random event is calculated once a day. The individuals (players from now on) can be infected at any time (that is, any day of the season) from people different to the players (technical staff of the team, family, etc.) with a probability \u03b2 ext . The second source of infection occurs during the training period, where they can be infected from other players of their own team with probability \u03b2 train . Finally, during the matches, players are exposed to infection from the players of their own team and the adversary team with probability \u03b2 match . 1",

We supposed no resting days, as there is a clear interest for finishing the leagues as soon as possible, but including them in the model is trivial. We represented the training dynamics of the players, and contacts between them, using social networks instead of mean-field contacts. In this way, players' social networks during the team training followed a random structure of connections (different for each team but maintained during all simulations) and were generated using an Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi model [17] with a probability p = 0.2 of connecting two players. This was done to describe the internal professional and friendship dynamics that every player has during training times and also during lunch time, etc. During training time, the infectious players (class I) might infect their neighbours in the social network with probability \u03b2 train . During the match day, every infected player on the pitch can infect any other player of its own team or the adversary with probability \u03b2 match (here we used a mean-field approach due to the inevitable contact dynamics that players follow during a match). Note that players cannot avoid voluntarily the contact with other players in the contest (with the exception, perhaps, of celebrating a goal, that could be forbidden if necessary), and therefore the contagion probability during a match might be more significant than expected at first glance. Also, as a third infection source, players can be infected any day from their social circle with probability \u03b2 ext . Finally, in order to minimise the spreading of the disease, a virus test is done to all 500 players every N test days (in particular in days that are multiples of N test , and before the match if it coincides with a match day). Players that yield a positive result are immediately confined.",

During a match, nonetheless, an infectious player can infect any of the other 21 players in the field, and will infect on average 21\u03b2 match = 0.21 players per match (supposing again that the rest are susceptible). In summary, at the beginning of La Liga, and in the improbable situation that an infected player skipped all virus tests, he/she would infect around two other players during the latent period, and this quantity would decrease with time as more and more players become infected and then recovered. We believe this is a plausible result taking into account that R 0 > 4 at the beginning of the pandemic and R 0 \u2248 1 after two months of absolute quarantine of the whole population of the country, and players would have an intermediate situation with a controlled but not quarantined behaviour.",

On the one hand, with N match being the lowest, the competition would last fewer weeks, and therefore the players would be exposed for less time. On the other hand, the probability of being infected is higher during a training day than during a match day, since players are more exposed to physical contact with other players during training.

In Fig. 2C we see how important it is to perform tests as often as possible, ideally every day. As the tests are more separated over time, the risk of infecting more players inevitably increases. Finally, it is possible to simulate how important the accuracy of the tests is and the consequences of making use of low sensitive methods. Figure 2D shows how the mean value of infected playersn(t) increases as the reliability of the tests \u00b5 E and \u00b5 I decreases. These results support the convenience of performing PCR testing, whose accuracy is estimated to be substantially larger than any other method. As mentioned above, the curves shown in Fig. 2 are the mean values n(t) obtained after m = 10 4 simulations of the model. While the standard deviation of the meann(t), \u03c3n = \u03c3 n / \u221a m, is so small that would be hardly distinguishable from the curves in any of the plots, the standard deviation of n(t), \u03c3 n , is on the contrary very large -in some cases of the order of the mean n-and shows that the evolution of a single process is highly unpredictable. To cast light on this question, in Fig. 3 we have plotted the probability function of the accumulated number of infected players n(t) (i.e., probability of obtaining n(t) = 1, 2, 3... accumulated infected players after t days, calculated as the normalised histogram of 10 5 simulations of the process) when matches and PCR controls are carried out every 7 days (green curve in Fig.  2A ) after t = 4 days, 20 days, and at the end of the league (t = 78 days). In the first days of the competition (Fig. 3A) , the disease starts to spread in the team of the so-far unique infected player. As expected, a Poisson distribution approximates accurately its function probability (note that in this and further calculations of approximations to the data, we subtract the initial infected individual from the series and shift the obtained curve 1 position in the X-axis). However, the disease soon spreads towards other teams and the function distribution becomes more complex: at moderate values of the time (t = 20, Fig. 3B ) the probability function presents a hump that certifies that the curve is in fact the consequence of several spreading processes, that is, the addition of intra-and interteam spreading, plus the potential infections coming from outside the league. Furthermore, when the season reaches its end (t = 78, Fig. 3C ) the curve presents an exponential-like tail, and at that time the standard deviation \u03c3 n is almost as large as the meann (as , when matches and PCR controls are carried out every 7 days. For these 4 cases,n \u00b1 \u03c3 n = 1.6 \u00b1 0.8, n \u00b1 \u03c3 n = 4.3 \u00b1 3.6,n \u00b1 \u03c3 n = 5.6 \u00b1 4.8, andM inf \u00b1 \u03c3 M inf = 1.4 \u00b1 0.6 respectively. Approximations to a Poisson distribution of meann, to an exponential distribution of meann and to a normal distribution of meann and standard deviation \u03c3 n are shown in (A-C), while an approximation to a Poisson distribution of meanM inf is shown in (D). 10 5 simulations of the league were performed.",

The recovery time after a match would be reduced and the risk of injury would increase. To reduce this risk, teams should increase player rotations. Regarding the tests, football clubs should provide the necessary support and means to carry out such a high number of tests in such a short time. Without an adequate policy in this regard, the risk of reinfection in a competition would skyrocket. Players will also pay a personal cost to control the eventual spreading of coronavirus. Minimising their contacts with other individuals would mean limiting their travels, public events and, in general, reducing interactions with people outside the family environment. In fact, maintaining them in confinement during the rest of the season would be obviously the optimum situation.",
