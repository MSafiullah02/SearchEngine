Emphasis is placed on defining eradication, but not on clarifying how these two concepts would differ in practice. Herein lies the problem: in developed countries, a single episode of poliovirus transmission would be cited as a failure of effective disease management. The logical endpoint of Caplan's proposal is that, in abandoning eradication, we should accept that poliovirus transmission will occur, not in developed communities, but elsewhere.",

Vigilance, prophylaxis, research, and surveillance are not ends in themselves; they are the means for preventing disease. Health-care structures would not lose capacity for future disease control despite stopping training in how to recognise and treat the specific target disease. Caplan's concern is not supported by history: eradicating smallpox has in no way hindered polio control or containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome.",
