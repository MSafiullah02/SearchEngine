            "text": "Applications for UVGI systems in commercial buildings vary with the type of building, but virtually every type of building can benefit from the use of in-duct air disinfection and many buildings can benefit from the use of other types of UV systems. The health hazards and microbiological problems associated with various types of commercial buildings are often unique to the type of facility. The problem of air quality is paramount in commercial office buildings while the problem of biocontamination is of the highest concern in the food industry. Other types of buildings have their own microbial concerns and even their own standards. The pharmaceutical industry has the highest aerobiological air quality standards (and lowest airborne microbial levels) while the other extreme, the agricultural industry, has the highest airborne microbial levels and unique aerobiological concerns. The individual problems of these facilities are addressed in the following sections, and industry experience relating to UV applications are discussed, along with recommendations for how UV systems can be applied. The specific types of UVGI systems are described in previous chapters and these should be referred to for detailed information on such applications.",

            "text": "Commercial buildings are the single largest and most common type of building in the United States today, in terms of total floor area. Many common respiratory infections are regularly transmitted inside these structures due to daily occupancy and the extensive interaction of people within office buildings. Proximity and duration of exposure are major factors in the transmission of respiratory infections between office workers (Lidwell and Williams 1961). The risk of catching the common cold is increased by shared office space (Jaakkola and Heinonen 1995). Tuberculosis has also been show to transmit in office buildings between co-workers (Kenyon et al. 2000). An association between respiratory tract symptoms in office workers and exposure to fungal and house dust mite aeroallergens was established by Menzies et al. (1998). The recent appearance of SARS virus highlights the susceptibility of office workers to the spread of airborne viruses (Yu et al. 2004). Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), often referred to as Building Related Illness (BRI) is a general category for a number of ailments, allergies, and complaints that are due to low levels of pollutants, synthetic irritants, fungi, bacteria or other factors that cause reactions in a certain fraction of building occupants (Lundin 1991).",

Accumulation of microbes on the cooling coils and ductwork can contribute to indoor air quality problems (Fink 1970). The aerobiology of office buildings can depend on both indoor sources (i.e. occupancy and cleanliness) as well as the composition and concentration of microbes in the outdoor air. Environmental microbes can enter via the ventilation system, via occupants (i.e. on clothes and shoes), and infiltration, especially from high-traffic lobbies that are under high negative pressure. Office buildings provide an environment that sustains microorganisms long enough for them to transmit infections to new hosts, or sometimes allows them to persist indefinitely, as in the case of fungal spores (Kowalski 2006). The indoor airborne concentrations of bacteria and fungi increase with the presence of occupants, due to the fact that people release bacteria continuously and also because human activity stirs up dust that may contain fungi and bacteria. Sessa et al. (2002) measured average office airborne concentrations of 493 cfu/m3 for bacteria and 858 cfu/m3 for fungi while levels were about four times lower when there were no occupants.",

Increasing filtration efficiency is one possible solution but retrofitting MERV filters in the 9\u201313 range, which can be highly effective against most airborne pathogens and allergens, may be difficult in most buildings because of increased pressure losses and possible reduction in airflow (Kowalski and Bahnfleth 2002). A suitable alternative to replacing filters is to add UV systems in the ductwork, which will not necessarily have any impact on airflow or pressure drop (see Fig. 18.1). In-duct UVGI is the most economic approach to disinfecting the air of commercial office buildings provided there is space in the ventilation system.\n\n",

Industrial facilities that handle organic materials have greater microbiological hazards while those that process inorganic products usually have less microbial hazards and more pollution hazards. Pollution, however, is a contributing factor in infectious diseases, including respiratory diseases. There are many types of occupational diseases, including asthma, and allergic reactions or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which are not necessarily due to microbiological causes.

Allergen-bearing airborne particulates are causative agents of lung inflammation via their immunotoxic properties and can induce inflammatory alveolitis (Salvaggio 1994). Occupational asthma occurs in 2\u20136% of the asthmatic population and respiratory infection can be a predisposing factor for occupational asthma (Bardana 2003). Workers who clean or enter rarely-used rodent infested structures may be at increased risk of exposure to rodent-borne viruses such as hantavirus (Armstrong et al. 1995). Industries that process wood or paper, or that make use of paper products, have airborne allergen hazards since cellulose provides a nutrient source for a variety of allergenic fungi. Microbiological sampling in furniture factories found the most common airborne microorganisms included Corynebacterium, Arthrobacter,\nAspergillus, Penicillium, and Absidia (Krysinska-Traczyk et al. 2002). Microbiologial studies of the air in sawmills were conducted by Dutkiewicz et al. (1996), who found that the most common organisms were Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Microbacterium, Bacillus spp., Gram-negative bacteria (Rahnella) and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium). Inhalation anthrax and cutaneous anthrax still occur occasionally in the textile industry. In a mill in the USA where outbreaks had occurred, anthrax levels were measured at up to 300 cfu/m3 (Crook and Swan 2001). Q fever, which can result from inhalation or exposure to Coxiella burnetti, has been reported among workers in a wool and hair processing plant (Sigel et al. 1950).",

Foodborne pathogens are generally transmitted by the oral route and almost exclusively cause stomach or intestinal diseases but some foodborne pathogens may be airborne at various stages of processing, storage, cooking, or consumption. The processing and handling of foods may also create opportunities for airborne mold spores to germinate and grow, resulting in secondary inhalation hazards. Applications for UVGI in the food industry include both air and surface disinfection, including surface disinfection of packaging materials and food handling equipment. UV has been used for air and surface disinfection in cheese plants, bakeries, breweries, meat plants, for food preservation, and for the decontamination of conveyor surfaces, and packaging containers (Koutchma 2008). One of the earliest applications of UV in the food industry involved the use of bare UV lamps to irradiate surfaces in the brewing and cheese making industries to control mold (Philips 1985). Liquid food disinfection with UV has been approved by the FDA but although UV has been highly effective for water disinfection, successful applications in disinfecting other liquids depends on the transmissivity of the liquid.",

UV irradiation can significantly reduce the mold population on shells of eggs in only 15 min (Kuo et al. 1997). Studies have demonstrated that UV can reduce levels of E. coli and Salmonella on pork skin and muscle, Listeria on chicken meat, and Salmonella on poultry (Wong et al. 1998, Kim et al. 2001, Wallner-Pendleton et al. 1994). Begum et al. (2009) demonstrated that UV irradiation can inactivate food spoilage fungi like Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Eurotium but that the type of surface impacted the degree of disinfection. Marquenie et al. (2002) showed that Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia fructigena, two major post-harvest spoilage fungi of strawberries and cherries, could be reduced 3\u20134 logs by UV irradiation by doses of about 1000 J/m2. Stevens et al. (1997) reported that UV could effectively reduce the incidence of storage rot disease on peaches due to Monilinia fructicola, reduce green mold (Penicillium digitatum) on tangerines, and reduce soft rot due to Rhizopus on tomatoes and sweet potatoes. Liu et al. (1993) showed that tomato diseases caused by Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, and Rhizopus stolonifer were effectively reduced by UV treatment. Hidaka and Kubota (2006) demonstrated a 90% reduction of Aspergillus and Penicillium species on the surfaces of wheat grain. Seiler (1984) reported increases in mold-free shelf life of clear-wrapped bakery products after moderate levels of UV exposure. Treatment of baked loaves in UV conveyor belt tunnels resulted in significantly increased shelf life (Shama 1999). Valero et al. (2007) found that UV irradiation of harvested grapes could prevent germination of fungi during storage or the dehydration process for raisins, using exposure times of up to 600 s.",

In general, these do not present inhalation hazards, only ingestion hazards. However, some of these microbes can become airborne during processing and settle on foods, thereby becoming amenable to control by UV air and surface disinfection systems. Modern foodborne pathogens are often uniquely virulent and hazardous, like Salmonella and Shigella, which are contagious and depend on either on excretion in feces or vomiting to facilitate epidemic spread. Some agents of food poisoning, like Staphylococcus and Clostridium, are opportunistic or incidental contaminants of foods. Many molds like Aspergillus and Penicillium are common contaminants of the outdoor and indoor air that can grow on food and although they are not food pathogens they are potential inhalation hazards for food industry workers. Foodborne pathogens are predominantly bacteria but one virus has recently emerged and joined this class, Norwalk virus. Norwalk virus is a waterborne pathogen and has caused outbreaks on cruise ships (Marks et al. 2000). Food spoilage microbes are less of a health hazard than they are a nuisance in the food industry because of the damage they can cause to processed food (Samson et al. 2000). A wide variety of yeasts may also be causes of spoilage.",

Studies indicate that Salmonella can survive in air for hours (Stersky et al. 1972). If air is recirculated through plant ventilation systems, organic material may accumulate inside ductwork and on air handling equipment, where fungi and bacteria may grow (Wallin and Haycock\n1998).

Most of the studies produced a reduction of disease transmission with a net average reduction in respiratory infections of approximately 30%, and were effective against measles, mumps, varicella, chickenpox, cold viruses and other respiratory infections. Upper Room systems can be especially effective in classrooms that have little of no ventilation air and that have high ceilings. There are no studies that have addressed In-duct UVGI systems, which would be likely to prove even more effective if they were adequately designed.",

The incidence of respiratory disease aboard military ships increases as ship size decreases (Blood and Griffith 1990). A study of a tuberculosis outbreak aboard a Navy ship found that although proximity and direct contact played a role in transmission, airborne transmission of droplet nuclei, including via the ventilation system, was responsible for most of the secondary infections (Kundsin 1980). It is common for outbreaks aboard ships to consist of multiple viral and bacterial infections, including diarrheal illness and influenza (Ruben and Ehreth 2002). Noroviruses are responsible for 23 million cases of illness each year and Norwalk viruses have recently caused numerous outbreaks of gastroenteritis on cruise ships. They are largely attributed to fomites on ship surfaces. During 2002, cruise ships with foreign itineraries sailing into US ports reported 21 gastroenteritis outbreaks on 17 cruise ships, of which most were identified as noroviruses (Cramer et al. 2003).

Table 18.4 lists the most common microorganisms that have been found to grow or to occur in sewage and waste (Kowalski 2006). Many of these are human pathogens and they include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. For information on the UV susceptibility of these pathogens refer to Appendix A, which addresses most of these species. Many of these species are potentially airborne and can cause respiratory infections, while most of the remainder are either waterborne or foodborne stomach pathogens.",
