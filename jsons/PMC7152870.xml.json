The further analysis about lymphocyte subsets also indicated that the count of all lymphocyte subsets significantly declined in severe patients than those in non-severe group. CD3 as the biomarker of mature T lymphocyte, helps to activate the CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell10. CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell have an important role in regulating and maintaining the stability of the internal immune environment11. Some research about SARS shown that a dramatic loss of CD4+ T (90\u2013100% of patients) and CD8+ T cells (80\u201390% patients) was characterized in patients with the acute phase of SARS12. The mechanism of the reduction of T lymphocytes may be associated with the direct invasion of SRAS-COV-2, which have been confirmed in MERS-CoV13. In addition, the development of autoimmune antibodies triggered by viral infection may lead to growth inhibition and apoptosis of hematopoiesis14, which can decline the production and differentiation of T lymphocytes and other lymphocytes. Severe SARS-CoV infected patients presented the delayed development of the adaptive immune response and prolonged virus clearance15. SARS-CoV-2 may have the ability to activates the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways and promote apoptosis of T lymphocytes as well as that in cases with MERS-CoV13. The level of T lymphocytes also regulated by antigen presenting cell (APC) and dendritic cell (DC) cells, and SARS-CoV-2 may alter function of APC and impair DC migration, which can reduce priming of T lymphocytes16\n,\n17. In addition to being affected by SARS-CoV-2 and other immune cell, the function of T lymphocytes was also regulated by cytokines. TNF-\u03b1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which can promote T lymphocytes apoptosis through interacting with TNFR1, which mainly expressed on aged T cell18. The production of IL-4 can block regulatory T cell function19.",

From the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, the level of T lymphocytes gradually increased during the treatment in non-severe patients, and always significantly higher than those in severe group. In the improvement subgroup of severe patients, the value of T lymphocytes began to increase after 15-day treatment, finally returned to the normal level after 25-day treatment. The time of recovery of T lymphocyte count was approximately consistent with the clinical course. In contrast, the level of T lymphocytes in dead subgroup of severe patients continued to fall until death. Compared to young patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the elderly patients with comorbidities had a worse prognosis was associated with the poor immunity, especially the lower function of T lymphocytes. However, there were no obvious decrease of B cell and NK cell between improved and dead subgroup of severe patients, most of them kept in normal level. It is because that the cellular immune, T lymphocytes plays a crucial role in virus clearance after virus infection, while humoral immune is primarily mediated by the production of antibodies, neutralization of virus to play a role. T lymphocytes directly dissolve and destroy infected cells to eliminate the virus, and secret cytokines which enhance the immune response of T lymphocytes and other immunologically active cells such as macrophages and B lymphocytes20.",

Our results shown that complement C3 were significantly higher in severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia than that in non-severe patients. It had been found that complement activation regulates a systemic proinflammatory response to SARS-CoV infection and the inhibition of complement C3 can reduced systemic inflammation22. The anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a, and C5a, which were produced during activation of complement signaling, had potent proinflammatory properties and can aggravate the viral infection and acute lung injury23.
