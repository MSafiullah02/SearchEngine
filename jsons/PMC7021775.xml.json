In-hospital mortality rates have been reported as 15\u201328% in previous studies1,2. Although diagnostic tools, management algorithms, and antibiotic medications for IE are improving, IE treatment still remains a challenge for clinicians. For patients with uncontrolled infection or uncompensated heart failure, an early surgical approach is recommended to prevent progressive valvular structural damage and catastrophic systemic embolism, which are associated with poor prognosis3\u20135. The elderly population is increasing in developed countries worldwide6, and advanced age is an important risk factor for IE7\u20139. However, elderly patients tend to receive more conservative treatment strategies with a small proportion undergoing surgery, which was reported as only 38\u201347% in previous studies10,11. This retrospective study aimed to clarify the short- and mid-term outcomes among elderly patients who underwent cardiac valvular surgery for active left-sided native valve IE (LSNIE) based on an individual centre\u2019s experience.",

Active endocarditis was defined as definitive IE requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy until surgery15. After excluding 23 patients with sub-acute IE that resolved after a complete antibiotic treatment course and underwent delayed surgery due to residual valvular insufficiency found by follow-up echocardiography, and 17 with prosthetic valve IE, 179 patients were included. The patients were classified into two age groups: \u226565 years (elderly group, n = 38, 21.2%) and <65 years (non-elderly group, n = 141, 78.8%) according to previous definitions of elderly10,16. Preoperative septic emboli-related complications were diagnosed according to clinical symptoms and image studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which were interpreted by experienced radiologists. If the vegetations were located in the aortic valve, preoperative coronary angiography was avoided to prevent new systemic embolic events. For patients with unstable haemodynamics or cardiopulmonary failure, depending on the inotropic agents and ventilator support, surgery was performed on an emergency basis.",

Using a standard sternotomy approach, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established via cannulation of the ascending aorta and right atrium or the venae cavae. Cardiac arrest was induced by a single dose of histidine\u2013tryptophan\u2013ketoglutarate solution or intermittent cold-blood cardioplegic solution through the coronary orifice. The diseased valves were carefully inspected, and the feasibility of valvular repair was considered after complete debridement of the infected tissues. The decision of valve repair or replacement was dependent on the surgeon\u2019s discretion regarding the degree of valvular destruction and patient characteristics, including heart function, comorbidities, and preoperative haemodynamics. For infected mitral valves that were repairable, the Carpentier principle was applied17, and ring annuloplasty was used to ensure the long-term durability of repair. In Regards to infected aortic valves that were repairable, a pericardium patch was usually used for reconstructing the valvular defects following debridement. If valve replacement was necessary due to limited healthy tissue, the prosthetic choice was based on the patient\u2019s individual preference after a detailed discussion before surgery. Before patients were weaned off CPB, haemostasis and good competency of the treated valve were confirmed, and a global assessment of cardiac function was performed.",

Preoperative and surgical variables found to be significant in the univariate analysis of in-hospital mortality were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Numbers of events (in-hospital mortality) per covariate fell below four or five in the present study; therefore, we used penalization through data augmentation to perform multivariate logistic regression to avoid sparse data bias19,20. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit for the multivariate logistic regression model21.

First, because the study used a retrospective and nonrandomized control design with a small sample size, bias might exist that influenced the homogeneity of the study groups and the stability of the multivariate logistic regression model. Second, as this cohort spanned a period of >10 years, the technology of CPB and myocardial protection, as well as strategies for treating IE and ICU care protocols may have changed over this time period. Third, as this was a retrospective study, some haemodynamic data, laboratory profiles, and inotropic medication dosage information were not completely analysed due to incomplete records. This hindered more detailed analyses of physiological fluctuations during the perioperative course. Finally, despite the satisfactory mid-term results, an extended follow-up study should be conducted in the future to evaluate the long-term outcomes in the elderly population.",
