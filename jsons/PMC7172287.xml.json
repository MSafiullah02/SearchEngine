They are becoming more realistic and representative of the in vivo physiology and therefore offer a suitable alternative for in vivo animal testing. This is due to several reasons. By means of modern miniaturization and automation techniques, cell culture models can support massive screening and cost effectiveness in contrast to the more expensive animal trials with limited screening capacity. Another driving force behind their growing popularity is the generally negative view of animal testing by the wide public. In effect, cell models are in line with the three R paradigm (Reduce, Refine, Replace). In this spirit, the EU will ban the marketing of cosmetic products developed using repeated dose animal experimentation by 2013, which raises a profound need for efficient alternative methods. The new EU regulation on chemicals (Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, 2006 - REACH) demands toxicological data for all chemicals, forcing industry into testing a large panel of potentially hazardous substances. Additionally, cell line models simplify biological systems to an easier and more manageable platform for research. The establishment of standardized and validated cell culture based methods for toxicology, food borne diseases, bioavailability and metabolism studies in the field of food science and nutrition can bring intestinal cell models to a new era due to their simplicity, reliability and reproducibility.",

Histologically, the small intestine can be divided into the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, although precise boundaries between these three segments are not observed macroscopically or microscopically (Cencic & Langerholc, 2010). Due to folds and invaginations, the presence of millions of villi on the apical surface amplifies the mucosal surface area to approximately 400 m2. In contrast, the large intestine, is wider, shorter (100\u2013150 cm) and has a smoother surface (Klein, Cohn, & Alpers, 2006). The intestinal epithelium is continuously renewing itself at an unprecedented rate, which on the downside makes it susceptible to malignant transformations (Radtke & Clevers, 2005).",

This barrier is of pivotal role for maintaining body health and homeostasis.

Most of the current cell line intestinal models are using transformed cell lines (Table 1\n), isolated from cancer affected individuals. Among them, only Caco-2, the most widely used and established cell line has been studied in detail. Despite the non-specificity of the existing cancer-derived cell lines, as well as their other limitations such as altered glycosylation, unresponsiveness to hormones/cytokines and inadequate expression of proteins defining epithelial character (Peracaula, Barrabes, Sarrats, Rudd, & de Llorens, 2008), they have been extensively used in specific applications of intestinal simulation. Additionally, cell passage dependent protein expression or other functional changes should be documented (e.g. for Caco-2 there are inter-laboratory variations in transepithelial resistance as much as 20-fold) (Hidalgo, 2001). A common alternative to cancer-derived cell lines is cell immortalization by infection with viruses such as Epstein\u2013Barr, SV40 or transfection with anti-apoptotic proteins, but metabolic and morphological changes are often observed (Q. Chen, Liang, Fromm, & Overbeek, 2004). In addition, cells of non-human or non-intestinal origin are commonly accepted as the model for the human intestine.",

On the other hand, growing epithelial cells on microporous membranes (e.g. insert filters, Transwell models) leads to spontaneous cell differentiation and polarization (Tremblay, et al., 2006), enabling basolateral feeding of epithelia similar to the in vivo setting (Fig. 1\n). Additionally, microporous membranes facilitate bioavailability and transport studies through the polarised epithelial monolayer. To achieve better functionality, epithelial cells growing on microporous membranes can be co-cultured with same-species derived monocyte/macrophages growing in the lower compartment or on the microporous membrane using an inverted setting (Fig. 1). In this way the in vivo environment of the intestine can be simulated more accurately and the chemical crosstalk (chemokine and cytokine release) between the intestinal and immune cells in response of an antigenic stimulus can be studied in detail (Westendorf, Fleissner, Hansen, & Buer, 2010). Furthermore, since intestinal epithelia is not only populated by enterocytes, they can be co-cultured with other more-specialized cell types on microporous membranes, like mucus-producing Goblet cells (Mahler, Shuler, & Glahn, 2009). Mucins, mainly present in the colon, physically protect the epithelia from commensal bacteria (Dharmani, Srivastava, Kissoon-Singh, & Chadee, 2009) and could represent a diffusion barrier for larger proteins and lipophilic substances (Larhed, Artursson, & Bjork, 1998).",

In such experiments, epithelial cells growing on a microporous membrane form a barrier between the apical and basolateral compartments. When substances are added to the apical side, time dependent concentration on the basolateral side is measured, usually by HPLC. Alternatively, reverse transport can be measured by adding substances to the basolateral side. Intestinal cell models have also been used for bioavailability studies of drugs.

Existing intestinal models for permeability studies have several drawbacks. Most of the used cell lines require prolonged cultivation before they polarize and differentiate into enterocyte-like cells (up to 21 d for Caco-2, Markowska, et al., 2001), although shorter times have been reported for LLC-PK1 (Da Violante, et al., 2004). In addition, inaccurate bioavailability results can be obtained because of non-specific drug binding to plastic devices observed at lipophilic compounds. Protocols, media composition, in vitro digestion of food matrix prior to application onto the cells, pH, culturing conditions as well as cell passage number are not standardized, which is reflected by largely different permeability values obtained by different laboratories for the same substances (Ingels & Augustijns, 2003). Apart from technical problems, another issue concerns the suitability of in vitro intestinal cell models in reflecting in vivo permeability. Most of the existing cell line models are cancer-derived, with significantly different gene expression as of the normal human intestinal cells (Hayeshi, et al., 2008). Changes in expression of transporters and metabolic enzymes in cell models can lead to under- or overestimation of intestinal epithelial permeability.",

In contrast, the PSI cell line with TEER values reaching 7000 \u03a9\u2217cm\u22122 is a particularly suitable model to study active transport, while the CLAB cell line (reaching 50\u2013100 \u03a9\u2217cm\u22122), is more fitted for paracellular transport studies. From human models, the H4 cell line is superior to Caco-2, since TER values reach 200\u2013400 \u03a9\u2217cm\u22122 and are physiologically close to the normal tissue (Nanthakumar, et al., 2000).",

Although the majority of such studies are performed in vivo using murine models of chemically induced colitis (Grangette, et al., 2005), the preliminary screening of potentially probiotic bacteria for cytokine release induction is done in single or two-compartment functional cell line models, as described previously. However, cell models have been directly used in other fields of intestinal pathogenesis, in order to elucidate the mechanism of inflammatory disease progression (Biasi, et al., 2009), carcinogenic transformation (Rafa, et al., 2010) and intestinal mucosa barrier disruption (Rodriguez-Lagunas, Martin-Venegas, Moreno, & Ferrer, 2010).",

Cell line models have been used to study such host\u2013pathogen interactions. For example, infection of the T84 cell line with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli leads to a decrease in TEER, caused by the EspF protein (McNamara, et al., 2001). MDCK cells (despite being dog kidney cells) were used as an intestinal model were used to determine the entry mechanism of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which interacts with \u03b2-integrins expressed on M cells in the areas of cell contacts (Tafazoli, Holmstrom, Forsberg, & Magnusson, 2000). Salmonella typhimurium infection involves a signal transduction pathway in epithelia that results in the recruitment of neutrophils (Criss, Silva, Casanova, & McCormick, 2001), identified by using the MDCK cell line. Possible mechanisms of Campylobacter jejuni invasion, translocation and pathogenesis in the pig functional cell model were in part elucidated (Pogacar et al., 2010). Cell cultures can also be used for studies of viruses that enter the host via the alimentary tract and either infect or destroy epithelial cells (coronaviruses, rotaviruses). Some viruses cross the mucosal layer and cause systemic infection, as in the case of poliovirus. In the latter case, M cells have been indicated as transporters of the virus across the mucosal barrier in a Caco-2 cell model derived M cells (Ouzilou, et al., 2002). In addition, the Hepatitis E virus can be efficiently propagated in pig cell cultures and tick-borne encephalitis virus in mammalian intestinal and macrophage cell lines (Cencic & Langerholc, 2010).",

The main advantage of intestinal cell models is their simplicity, inter-laboratory repeatability and large-scale testing capacity. In addition, they constitute an indispensable tool for the elucidation of intestinal absorption mechanisms. Moreover, they present a more economic and ethical alternative to animal testing. Although not frequently used so far, specialised and functional intestinal cell models hold several advantages over generic cell lines, as they can simulate more closely the in vivo environment, without however sacrificing their simplicity and reliability. In the future, we expect that the development of more improved and specialised cell models and experimental set-ups, together with automation (such as high-throughput screening) and miniaturization, will bring cell line platforms to a higher level, appropriate for cost effective and large-scale analysis in food and nutritional research.",

Cells can be grown in a conventional manner with apical side upwards, or alternatively, the filter with polarized cells can be inverted, so that the top of the membrane is equivalent to the basolateral side. In both conventional and inverted setting co-cultured immune cells, substances and microorganisms can be added to apical or basolateral side, enabling functional studies described in the main text on both sides of the epithelia.
