LGBT stigma refers to the intertwined processes of social exclusion, devaluation, reduced access to opportunities, and power inequities disproportionately impacting gender and sexual minorities [6].

Despite policy change, LGBT stigma remains pervasive, including targeted violence, familial rejection, health care service denial, and other human rights violations [8, 9].

            "text": "Examining health disparities among LGBT Basotho people necessitates a biosocial perspective. A syndemics framework deepens our understanding of the mechanisms by which social disparities, such as stigma and discrimination targeting LGBT persons in Lesotho, contribute to multiple interacting health epidemics [13]. Applying a syndemics approach has the potential to identify the roles that social environments, including poverty, stigma and violence, play in shaping interrelated health problems [13]. This approach is particularly salient for advancing health among LGBT persons who experience a greater global disease burden for HIV and mental health challenges [2, 14, 15]. As first proposed by Singer to describe interacting epidemics of substance use, violence and HIV [16], syndemics theory refers to \u201ca set of closely intertwined and mutual enhancing health problems that significantly affect the overall health status of a population within the context of a perpetuating configuration of noxious social conditions\u201d (p. 99). Scholars have extended this conceptual framework to LGBT health, particularly due to associations between HIV vulnerabilities and mental health [17, 18], problematic substance use [13], and interpersonal victimisation [19]. LGBT health literature more broadly has evidenced the relationship between social stigmatization and disease [20], yet, there has been limited study of LGBT stigma as a fundamental cause of multiple, interacting diseases [21] across low and middle-income contexts (LMIC). This may be particularly important to examine in socio-political contexts without LGBT human rights protection, including Lesotho. Moreover, the lack of human rights protection can also be understood as structural violence directed toward LGBT persons [22].",

For example, a 2019 study with transgender women in India reported that transgender identity stigma was associated with sexual risk and the clustering of depression, substance use, and HIV. Separately, a study with sexual minority women in Canada reported that harmful social conditions including low social support and economic insecurity mediated the pathway from sexual stigma to depression [26]. A large study with MSM across 151 countries found associations between social conditions including sexual stigma, violence, mental health challenges such as depression and substance use, and HIV vulnerabilities [27]. Taken together, these findings suggest that LGBT communities across global contexts experience harmful social conditions and mental health challenges that elevate HIV vulnerabilities.",

Evidence from Lesotho suggest that LGBT stigma is associated with increased HIV vulnerabilities and mental health problems [5, 28]. Among Basotho MSM social mistreatment [28] and healthcare stigma were associated with depression and alcohol use, and substance use including alcohol and non-injection illicit drugs was associated with HIV vulnerabilities measured as higher numbers of sex partners [5]. Another study with MSM in Lesotho reported associations between social stigma, depression, and reporting an HIV positive serostatus [4]. Among Basotho lesbian, bisexual and sexually diverse women, stigma and human rights abuses including blackmail, losing employment, and healthcare denial were associated with being diagnosed with HIV and other STIs [12]. Another study with MSM reported that widespread community-level verbal abuse targeting MSM, and secrecy surrounding same-sex relationships, were associated with sexual practices that elevated HIV vulnerabilities [28]. There is limited research among all LGBT communities beyond MSM in Lesotho that explores the social production of LGBT stigma and pathways to interacting health epidemics.",

A study with LGBT persons in Jamaica reported that social support and resilient coping partially mediated pathways from a latent construct of syndemics that included violence and substance use to sexual risk [29]. Furthermore, a study with MSM in Mexico reported that \u2018outness\u2019 about same sex sexual practices moderated pathways between syndemic factors, including substance use, depression, and internalized stigma, to sexual risks [30]. A systematic review of protective factors among cisgender MSM with interacting HIV risk factors identified structural (socio-economic), interpersonal (relationships), and intrapersonal (coping strategies, cognitions and emotions) factors [31] associated with lower HIV risks. Notably all studies included in this systematic review were in high income countries. A qualitative study with Black MSM in the US [32] found that persons without interacting psychosocial health conditions (depression, substance use, sexual abuse) reported having supportive relationships that fostered a positive sense of identity and health in comparison with those experiencing multiple conditions. Modifiable social factors that can mitigate the effects of harmful social conditions and interacting health issues are understudied in LMIC at large [30]. Identifying these protective factors can inform contextually tailored interventions.",

This suggests that LGBT stigma will manifest differently across contexts, leading to systematic differences in the ways that syndemics are produced and experienced. Campbell and Cornish [34] theorize that enabling social environments for HIV prevention include the interacting dimensions of symbolic context, such as cultural perspectives, values and ideologies, material and political context, including access to resources and opportunities, and relational context focused on social capital and relationships with institutional and state actors. Ultimately, characterizing how LGBT stigma (symbolic context) contributes to social isolation and exclusion (relational context) that in turn leads to interacting health epidemics among LGBT communities in Lesotho is critical to informing evidence-based and rights-affirming interventions. In response, the goals of this manuscript are to address knowledge gaps regarding socio-cultural mechanisms that link LGBT stigma, depression, substance use, and HIV among the LGBT community in Lesotho. We explore the role of stigma in producing and perpetuating the risk of interacting health challenges among LGBT persons in Lesotho.",

LGBT peer researchers recruited all participants via convenience recruitment methods, whereby participants were informed they could invite other participants. To ensure the study team had the same baseline understanding of LGBT health and rights, researchers at the Maluti College of Nursing were trained in LGBT issues and research methods, and conducted in-depth individual interviews in a private room at Matrix Support Group or a location of their choice (e.g. coffee shop, other community agency).

Participant narratives reveal the ways that symbolic contexts that devalue both LGBT persons and people living with HIV produced community level stigma. LGBT stigma fostered a climate where violence targeting LGBT persons was pervasive and at times fatal. LGBT persons experienced constrained access to justice and healthcare. LGBT stigma strained relational contexts, including in intimate partnerships, whereby inequitable sexual power dynamics reduced sexual agency for enforcing condom use. Using alcohol helped LGBT persons to cope with depression resulting from stigmatizing social contexts and was a tool to connect with other LGBT persons. Substance use, sexual violence, inadequate HIV prevention resources, and inequitable sexual relationship power converged to increase HIV vulnerabilities. Harmful social contexts emerged as the key factor contributing to the interacting issues of mental health challenges and HIV vulnerabilities.",

LGBT solidarity was another theme that arose as central to HIV care engagement, suggestive of bridging social capital. Similar to other research with sexually diverse women in Sub-Saharan Africa [38, 39], participants called for HIV education to include sexually and gender diverse women\u2014rather than solely focus on MSM. This tension is longstanding: money flows to HIV programs and can exclude persons (e.g. lesbians) with less clearly delineated HIV-related risks [43\u201345]. HIV funds are often the most stable funding source for LGBT agencies in LMIC, hence excluding sexually diverse women from LGBT programs could limit opportunities for them to build connections and relationships with other LGBT persons.

This study was originally designed to explore stigma among LGBT persons in Lesotho, hence there is not a focus on overlapping health issues central to most syndemics research. There was also not an explicit focus on mental health; while participants discussed strategies to manage HIV risks there was not a similar discussion on navigating mental health issues. There were not enough interviews conducted with lesbian and bisexual women, MSM, and transgender persons to define differential needs and experiences within the LGBT community. For that reason, there is a need for future studies to explore shared and different experiences of stigma and interacting health issues among LGBT persons in Lesotho.",

            "text": "Despite these limitations, this paper underscores LGBT stigma as a harmful social condition that contributes to the syndemic of interacting sexual and mental health disparities among LGBT persons in Lesotho. We identified complex pathways from stigma to: violence and exclusion, mental and sexual health outcomes, and sexual relationship dynamics. The growing literature on syndemics and protective factors underscores the need to consider the ways that affected communities navigate inequitable contexts. By exploring violence targeting LGBT communities and its sequalae, we signal the importance of considering the persistent and damaging influence of compulsory heterosexuality. We emphasize the interconnectedness and interplay of contextual dimensions that shape the production of LGBT stigma.",

Investing in LGBT community structures, including LGBT community-based agencies, can enhance social capital, foster social advocacy, and grow grassroots initiatives such as Lesotho Pride. Addressing structural violence requires advancing national LGBT human rights protection, as well as providing healthcare training and standards for LGBT affirmative care. These advocacy and institutional tactics can in turn transform social norms. Culturally tailored LGBT affirmative community-based mental health and substance use programs can be developed with LGBT persons in Lesotho to integrate local understandings of mental wellbeing and contextually appropriate adaptive coping strategies. There is an urgency to tackle LGBT mental health in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a dearth of research and efficacious interventions among general populations [46]. Even less is known about what works to promote mental health among LGBT persons. Taken together, these data suggest that interventions informed by a syndemics framework developed with and for LGBT persons in Lesotho have great potential in advancing social transformation, health and realization of human rights.",
