Virus may be amplified in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian cell culture, and then subjected to further testing for identification. Serological techniques [e.g. haemagglutination inhibition (HI) or microneutralization (MN)] may also be used to identify the presence of antibody in the serum of exposed individuals, providing indirect evidence of infection. These basic techniques can be used for diagnosing infections both in humans and in animals.",

There are 16 recognized HA and nine recognized NA subtypes of influenza A viruses. Wild waterfowl are considered the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses, and all HA and NA subtypes of influenza A have been identified in birds. Currently, only two influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) are circulating or appearing in humans, causing recurring human seasonal influenza epidemics.",
