            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in a world in which viral etiologies predominate [1], [2]. Despite improved diagnostic techniques, the pathogen remained unidentified in a significant proportion of cases, which led to the search for new viruses [3]. Among these, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first isolated by genetic analysis of nasopharyngeal samples from 28 hospitalized children. In these children, this virus, which belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family, was associated with signs of airway infection: cough, fever, runny nose, wheezing and dyspnea [4]. hMPV is an enveloped virus with a single negative-stranded RNA genome of \u223c13 kb [5]. As with other pneumoviruses, eight transcription units have been described. Some genes (F for the fusion protein, N for the nucleocapsid, M for the matrix and L for the polymerase) allow the characterization of the virus by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) [6]. More recently, immunofluorescence [7], [8] and multiplex real-time PCR techniques have been developed and virological diagnosis is more feasible in clinical practice.",

In most cases, the inclusion criterion was an ARI (including 31 studies with lower or upper respiratory tract infection and 20 studies with lower respiratory tract infection). Most studies included only pediatric populations (75 studies). Four studies included children and adults and two studies included adults only. Twenty-five studies were conducted in complete years, 34 over several years with varying inclusion periods depending on the year, 13 in one or several years but only during epidemic periods and 8 in one or several years during inclusion periods of seven to 11 months. Eleven studies included severe forms only, with various criteria for the definition of severity. The median quality score was 6.5 (IQR 5.5\u20137). The quality of studies is summarized in Supplementary Table 2, and details are shown in Supplementary Table 3.",

Nevertheless, a high degree of heterogeneity was observed (I2\n = 96.8%, 95% CI 96.4-97.1). This could be due to the diversity of study characteristics. Although meta-regressions took several study characteristics into account (sampling method, type of period, inclusion criteria, continent, year\u2026), these variables explained only a very small part of the heterogeneity encountered. This could be due to the heterogeneousness of the studies\u2019 characteristics persisting in each category. For example, inclusion criteria were classified in four categories (all ARI, low ARI, bronchiolitis or expiratory wheezing, and pneumonia), but \u201call ARI\u201d or \u201clow ARI\u201d could be defined differently (or not defined in 19/45 cases) according to the study. For the above reasons, subgroup analysis according to the definition of ARI could not be performed. Furthermore, the difference in prevalences observed between studies could be due to the strains varying according to the year and the location, leading to epidemics of varying magnitude. Indeed, like influenza virus epidemics, hMPV epidemics have different magnitudes depending on the year, as shown in several studies conducted over several years [30], [40], [68], [84], [92], [103]. No linear effect of the year was observed. Non-linear effects were not tested because we hypothesized that the variations according to the year would be different from one country to another. Similar heterogeneity was found in other meta-analyses of respiratory viruses [99], [101], [102].",

These periods of 6 months or less probably corresponded to the epidemic period for ARI or influenza. However, they may not have corresponded to the epidemic period for hMPV. In several studies conducted in Europe or Asia during complete years, the epidemic peak occurred in March or April in Asia and February or March in Europe [32], [34], [40], [43], [49], [75], [98]. However, several other studies included patients between September-October and March-April, and these could have underestimated the prevalence of hMPV. In other studies, in particular in South and Central America (two studies in Brazil [73], [90], one study in Argentina [61] and one study in Guatemala [68]), hMPV infections occurred throughout the year, which was not the case for other respiratory viruses. Once again, studies conducted in epidemic periods of respiratory infections could have underestimated the prevalence of hMPV in ARI.",

We chose to include only hospitalized patients who were screened for hMPV using PCR, in prospective studies that included all patients (or random sampling of patients) in the presence of inclusion criteria to limit the heterogeneity and to improve the quality of data. A total of 80, mostly high-quality, studies were included in the qualitative analyses and 75 studies (which accounted for 82,240 patients) were included in the meta-analyses and meta-regressions. Retrospective studies were excluded to avoid the inclusion of studies in which hMPV was not systematically tested and to avoid other bias inherent to retrospective studies.",

All the characteristics of the study could not be taken into account because the information was not available. However, as mentioned above this heterogeneity probably reflects the reality of the prevalence of hMPV in ARI across countries and according to the year. Thus, the estimation of the worldwide prevalence of hMPV in ARI does not reflect the prevalence in every country in every year. Nonetheless, the observed heterogeneity is a result of interest. Secondly, a publication bias could be suspected from the funnel plot, the rank test, and the prevalence of hMPV, which decreased with the number of samples in univariate analysis. However, the cumulative meta-analysis from the largest to the smallest study showed stabilization of the prevalence at around 6% near the 35th largest study, and did not show a large increase with the smaller studies. Moreover, the asymmetry is probably due to the very high heterogeneity [104]. This is why we did not use methods such as trim-and-fill methods [105]. Thirdly, although the global quality of included studies was good, the definition of acute respiratory infection was not clear in many studies. Fourthly, the literature search strategy could be questionable and may have been restrictive, but 75 studies were included. Finally, despite the inclusion of all ages in our inclusion criteria, most of studies were conducted in pediatric populations. This study therefore mainly reflects the prevalence of hMPV in children.",
