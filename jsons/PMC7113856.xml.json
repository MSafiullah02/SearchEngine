Despite many advances, IAVs are still a challenge for the scientists. IAVs are highly contagious and causative agents of seasonal flu epidemics resulting in morbidity, mortality and huge economic losses. Based on the circulating strains, seasonal influenza vaccines are developed annually or biannually, if needed, by WHO but the immunity provided is short-lived due to continuous change in the virus strains. Therefore, vaccination is usually required every year to be protected from seasonal flu that leads to increase in vaccine cost along with shortage of vaccines in developing countries. But the two main problems with vaccination are the time required to select, manufacture and deliver vaccine and the variable annual immunization rates (Couch, 2008). Besides vaccination, the antiviral agents are the therapeutic options to treat the infection. Antivirals against M2 protein and neuraminidase are available but their irrational use has led to the emergence of resistant strains (Agrawal et al., 2010, Hayden and Hay, 1992, Poland et al., 2009). Thus, there is a continued requirement of new antiviral agents against IAV.",

NS1 has two functionally distinct domains: the N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD), consisting of three \u03b1-helices, and the C-terminal effector domain, consisting of seven \u03b2-strands and three \u03b1-helices. The RBD domain binds with low affinity to several RNA species in a sequence independent manner (Chien et al., 2004, Hatada and Fukuda, 1992, Qian et al., 1995), and effector domain predominantly interacts with host-cell proteins and also functionally stabilizes RBD domain (Wang et al., 2002).",

Therefore, NS1 protein is a good target for therapeutics development and several small molecules have been found to inhibit NS1 function resulting in reduced viral replication (Engel, 2013, Nayak et al., 2014, Woo et al., 2013). In our previous study, we generated a panel of new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the RNA binding domain of NS1 (NS1(RBD)) (Tan et al., 2010). Here we report the biophysical characterization of one of these mAbs, named as 2H6, and NS1(RBD) protein interaction, and inhibition of viral replication by targeting NS1 protein in infected cells. 2H6 has been shown to bind to NS1 of different IAV subtypes, namely H5N1, H3N2 and H1N1 (Tan et al., 2010).",

Given that NS1(RBD) exists as a dimer of \u223c18 kDa, binding to 2H6-Fab of \u223c50 kDa will yield an expected size of \u223c120 kDa assuming the complex has a globular structure.

The occurrence of multimeric antigen\u2013antibody complex has been reported in several studies (Sanny and Price, 1997, Santora et al., 2001).

Since the side-chains of residues S42 and T49 make direct hydrogen bond with the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) backbone and dsRNA binding affinity is reduced by up to 10-fold when either of them is mutated (Cheng et al., 2009), two substitution mutants, NS1(RBD)-S42A and NS1(RBD)-T49A, were generated. To determine if these residues in NS1 are critical for interaction with 2H6, we performed a comparative ELISA (Fig. 3\nA). The results show that NS1(RBD) and NS1(RBD)-S42A bound comparably to 2H6 at all the antigen concentrations tested, while the binding of NS1(RBD)-T49A was significantly decreased when 0.125 or 0.031 \u03bcg/mL of protein was used for coating. No binding to Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was used as a negative control, was observed. A double substitution mutant NS1(RBD)-R38AK41A was also tested because these two residues, which lie upstream of the 2H6 binding domain, have previously been shown to be important for RNA binding (Wang et al., 1999). The NS1(RBD)-R38AK41A mutant has similar binding to 2H6 as NS1(RBD) confirming that residues upstream of S42 are not likely to be involved in the interaction.",

To express 2H6 intracellularly, the 2H6-scFv gene was cloned in a mammalian expression plasmid and transiently transfected into A549 cells. After 48 h, the cells were inoculated with 0.01 MOI of PR8 virus and the amount of virus secreted was determined by plaque quantitation at 12, 24, and 48 h post infection (hpi). As shown in Fig. 4\nA, the viral growth in the 2H6-scFv transfected A549 cells was reduced by approximately 0.5 log PFU/mL at 24 and 48 hpi when compared to cells transfected with vector only. To determine if viral inhibition by 2H6-scFv is specific, the scFv of an irrelevant antibody 7G12, which binds to the spike protein of SARS coronavirus (Lip et al., 2006), was also used in this experiment. The viral growth in the 7G12-scFv transfected A549 cells did not show reduction when compared to cells transfected with vector only.",

Consistent with the results obtained in A549 cells, the level of the M1 viral protein in the infected cells was significantly reduced in 2H6-scFv transfected cells when compared to the vector or 7G12-scFv transfected cells at 12 hpi (Fig. 4B and C). The average reduction in normalized M1 expression in 2H6-scFv transfected cells when compared to vector and 7G12-scFv transfected cells at 12 hpi is 27% and 49% respectively.

In the past, few small chemical compounds have been shown to inhibit both NS1 function and virus replication (Basu et al., 2009, Walkiewicz et al., 2011). But the precise mechanisms of action of these chemical compounds are still unknown and remain to be elucidated. Earlier, the function of CPSF30 binding site of the NS1 has been shown to be inhibited by the second and third zinc fingers (F2F3), a 61 residues fragment of CPSF30, resulting in the inhibition of IAV replication without detectable effects on cellular functions (Twu et al., 2006). Our approach of expressing 2H6-scFv in the cells to block IAV replication during infection is similar to their method of expressing F2F3 intracellularly to bind NS1 and inhibit its interaction with CPSF30. Interestingly, a recent publication has also reported the abilities of 3 NS1 specific-human scFvs to inhibit replication of influenza A virus (Yodsheewan et al., 2013). However, the mechanisms of binding are different as they bound to residues 7\u201318, 75\u201390 and 179\u2013190 of NS1, respectively.",

In future studies, it will be important to use a combination of different NS1 inhibiting molecules to determine if this can increase the potency of viral inhibition and/or minimize the chance of viral escape both in vitro and in vivo. Delivery of antibody or scFv into the cells is an important aspect of antiviral therapy. Thus, viral expression vectors such as adenovirus or lentivirus can be used for 2H6-scFv delivery. Moreover, cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP), a stretch of basic residues, has been extensively documented for its efficient delivery of biomolecules (Gump and Dowdy, 2007, Kim et al., 2006). Recently, hepatitis B virus replication has been reported to be inhibited by intracellular delivery of scFv against core protein via CTP (Xun et al., 2013). As an alternative to viral expression vectors, 2H6-scFv can be fused with CTP for the efficient cytoplasmic translocation of the scFv into the cells.",
