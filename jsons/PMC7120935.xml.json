Visitors to U.S. national parks rank viewing wildlife as a top reason for their attendance, and this would undoubtedly be true for visitors to a number of the world\u2019s protected areas, which now extend across 12% of the earth\u2019s surface (Brooks et al., 2004). Further evidence of wildlife as a driving force for tourism can be found in the 2006 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s (2007) National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. This study showed that 87 million Americans participated in some form of wildlife-associated recreation, including hunting (12.5 million people), fishing (24.5 million people), wildlife viewing involving trips away from home (22.9 million people) or viewing in one\u2019s day-to-day residential life (77 million people). Other data hint at a widespread global interest in wildlife-associated recreation. For example, the 1996 Survey on the Importance of Nature to Canadians indicates that approximately 18% of the Canadian population, or 4.2 million people, participated in fishing, and 5% of the population, or 1.2 million people, participated in hunting (Federal-Provincial Task Force on the Importance of Nature to Canadians, 1999).",

While hunting and fishing in the United States has declined, wildlife viewing has increased (Aiken, 1999; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007). Simultaneously, many specialized forms of wildlife-associated recreation have grown considerably in the last two decades. Hoyt (2000) estimated that the number of whale-watching tourists worldwide increased from 4 million in 1991 to 9 million in 1998. Bucking the overall trend of hunting in the United States, participation in trophy hunting in Africa has increased since the early 1990s, including a fourfold increase in Namibia and twofold increase in South Africa (Lindsey, Roulet, & Romanach, 2007). These few examples do not reveal the growth that is also occurring in the many specialty niche markets in wildlife-associated recreation including, for example, fly-fishing the flats in the tropics, bird viewing in Thailand or Costa Rica, viewing birds and reptiles on the Galapagos Islands, dolphin feeding in Australia, viewing monkeys at the temples in Singapore, and viewing butterflies in Mexico. The growth in these opportunities is related to strong consumer demand, the relatively low capital investment needed for ecotourism businesses, and the strong potential for local employment.",

The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, with 1,200 organizations worldwide, estimates an attendance of 600 million people annually (World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, 2007). There has also been a growing market for TV and cinema that focuses on the natural habits of wildlife instead of prior programming that featured wildlife primarily as anthropomorphized characterizations of human life. Animal Planet, a TV channel launched in 1996 that televises features about animals (wild and domesticated), has experienced rapid growth. As of 2005 it reached 237 million subscribers in 160 countries who speak 24 languages (Broadband TV News, 2005). The interest and growth of this programming is global with the channel most recently expanding to Germany, Italy, and Vietnam (Discovery Communications Inc., 2004). Additional examples of the rapid growth are the rising numbers of subscribers: In Latin America the increase was by 24% between 1999 and 2000 to 9 million subscribers, and, likewise, in Asia the increase was by 205% to more than 24 million subscribers (BBC, 2001). Viewership of wildlife films is also expanding. Winged Migration (2003) and March of the Penguins (2005) grossed over $31 million and $79 million worldwide respectively. These ticket sales make the films some of the most successful documentary films in history (Nash, 2005).",

The morning paper reports that a jogger was bitten by a rattlesnake at a local reservoir.

Choudhury (2004) reported that in northeastern India, human\u2013elephant conflict killed 1,500 people between 1980 and 2003. Retaliation and habitat loss have resulted in declining elephant populations, and in one area \u2013 Cachar, Assam \u2013 elephants have been extirpated. Rajpurohit and Krausman (2000) offered further evidence of the severity of impacts to humans; they reported that during a 6-year period (from 1989 to 1995) in south Bihar (India), elephants killed 242 people, sloth bears killed 50 people, and wolves killed 92 people.",

Expanding human settlement is believed to be the most critical reason: Driven by population pressures, economic growth, and the expanding global demand for natural resources, humans occupy more and more places. As this occurs, it destroys or fragments habitat, forcing humans and wildlife into confrontation. Because humans and wildlife share habitat, human\u2013wildlife conflict is often coincidental; however, sometimes conflict occurs because humans want to be close to wildlife. For example, results show that 55.5 million Americans engage in wildlife feeding activities (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007). Wildlife attracts tourists, and feeding wildlife has, in some cases, become a planned tourism activity (Orams, 2002). Feeding wildlife can lead to habituation, and animals may identify humans as a food source instead of a threat. Habituation is believed to be a factor in the death of a 9-year-old boy at an Australian World Heritage site; the boy was attacked by dingoes habituated through tourist feeding behavior (Thompson, Shirreffs, & McPhail, 2003). Beyond such direct attacks, human contact with wildlife can affect disease transmission. I review that concern in the next section.",

Macaques have a special status in Buddhist and Hindu cultures. They tend to congregate around temples where residents, workers, and tourists come in close contact with them. Through interaction with these macaques, people can be exposed through bites, scratches, or mucosal splashes. In these situations, there is a risk from transmission of pathogens such as herpes B, simian virus 40, simian foamy virus, and other simian retroviruses. The transmission of pathogens occurs both ways. Research shows macaques risk exposure to influenza and measles from humans (Jones-Engel, Engel, Schillaci, Babo, & Froehlich, 2001).",

CWD is a prion-based disease that kills deer and elk, and it has a significant effect on these animal populations in the United States. Recreational hunters in the United States harvest and consume thousands of these animals annually; this increases concern about the possibility of transmission of the disease. Should transmission occur, it would significantly affect human health.

At that time, game scarcity, extirpation, and extinction were part of a growing number of concerns over the resiliency of wildlife populations. Dramatic forest fires followed extensive clear-cutting in the Midwest. Erosion threatened farm productivity, and timber extraction outstripped regenerative capabilities. Mining and industrial pollution diminished the ability of lakes and rivers to support aquatic life (Frederick & Sedjo, 1991). With growing human populations and technological advances, such as the repeating rifle, many wildlife populations were rapidly depleted or became extinct (Harrington, 1991). The conservation leaders of that time, including Gifford Pinchot and Aldo Leopold, were guided by a desire to ensure \u201csustained yield\u201d of natural materials. The emerging tradition of wildlife management during this time was to convert hunting from exploitation to cropping (Peyton, 2000), and the results were immensely successful. The North American wildlife management profession \u2013 including its effective regulation of harvest, restoration of game populations, philosophy of science-based management, politically powerful stakeholder lobby, and sustained funding base (i.e., hunter and angler license fees) \u2013 must be considered one of the most notable conservation success stories.",

Legislation, such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973, symbolized concern for losses, even among species that had no utilitarian purpose. Studies of that time period show that a significant number of Americans were opposed to recreational hunting (Kellert, 1978; Shaw, 1977), and early research on public values shows a diversity of values toward wildlife, including a significant emphasis on non-utilitarian views regarding the resource (Kellert, 1980). In this values transition, wildlife, once viewed as villainous creatures, came to symbolize the lost ecological integrity desired by the public. An illustration of this was revealed in a recent meta-analysis of studies since the 1970s. The study showed that people in the United States currently favor wolves and wolf reintroduction (Williams, Ericsson, & Heberlein, 2002), whereas in the early twentieth century, the species was targeted for extirpation throughout the country.",

An excellent example is the declining habitat of polar bears, highlighted in Al Gore\u2019s movie Inconvenient Truth. During their migration to find a diminishing prey base, these bears have been caught on islands of drifting ice or left to swim incredible distances in search of refuge on stable ice. Due to global warming, which has led to extensive glacial melting in the polar regions, such refuge diminishes. The analogy is clear: Humans are on an \u201cisland\u201d that is eroding, and, without major changes, they will be left with a fruitless struggle.",

The traditional institutions of the profession have been slow to respond to the changing nature of concerns for wildlife and the environment. State-level fish and wildlife agencies in the United States, in particular, continue to prioritize issues of recreational hunting and fishing. Newly emerging non-governmental organizations and new types of academic programs (e.g., Conservation Biology) champion the broader concerns for global biodiversity. The focus of this movement is on global issues, and its approach is ecosystemic and integrative across disciplines. Funding comes from grassroots memberships and private donations. As an illustration, from 1994 to 2004 operating revenues of World Wildlife Fund doubled (WWF, 2005). Half of the revenue in 2004 was from contributions ($66 million), with $29 million from WWF members alone. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has experienced similar growth (Center for Consumer Freedom, 2005). In 1970 HSUS had an annual budget of about $500,000. By 1994, HSUS\u2019s annual revenue grew to $22 million, and by 2003 that number increased to $123 million.",

The development of markets for these services \u2013 as illustrated in the cases of carbon, wetlands, and water \u2013 brings the principles of capitalism to environmental protection (e.g., Hamilton, Bayon, Turner, & Higgins, 2007). Another important trend is that the concern for environmental quality is increasingly linked to discussions about the need to deal with worldwide poverty (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Long-term solutions to environmental degradation must consider the current imbalance of environmental benefits and costs for people.

Little (1999) declared the applied involvement of anthropology in environmental issues its own field of study. This field has explored the rise of environmentalism as a social movement, issues of indigenous rights, and the impacts on parks and protected areas with regard to such topics as poverty, development, social structure, and location of power and self-governance. The field also examines ecotourism. Ecotourism is a form of economic growth that is consistent with conservation goals, yet it often creates undesirable impacts on indigenous peoples (Little, 1999). Research on human\u2013wildlife relationships in this applied area of anthropology includes topics related to the nature of human\u2013wildlife conflict, wildlife damage compensation schemes, illegal trade of wildlife, co-management, subsistence issues, and the influence of global markets and policies on resource harvest. Another important trend from the anthropological line of research has been cross-disciplinary, integrative investigations (e.g., Galvin, Thorton, Roque de Pinho, Sunderland, & Boone, 2006). These studies model the complex interaction of social and biological forces to predict future conditions. These studies emerged from the cultural ecology and ecosystems traditions within anthropology and geography.",

AT has an international, cross-cultural emphasis, versus the tighter geographic focus of NAT. AT conducts work in association with NGOs, foundations, and development banks, while NAT\u2019s work is funded by governmental agencies charged with a more narrowly defined wildlife management mission. AT is more likely to employ qualitative research methods, whereas NAT is more likely to emphasize quantitative techniques. AT is more likely to examine issues pertaining to both domesticated and wild animal populations, while NAT focuses primarily on wild animal populations. Excluding the field of economics, AT\u2019s research is rooted in theory from anthropology and geography, whereas NAT\u2019s is based largely on theory from social psychology and sociology. AT is more likely to be engaged in cross-disciplinary research than NAT. AT often articulates an advocacy mission (conservation or animal rights) that is less apparent in NAT. Finally, aside from specialty conferences, the natural resources-oriented professional meetings for AT include those of societies like Society for Conservation Biology, The Society for Human Ecology, and the Ecological Society of America, while the corresponding organizations for NAT include The Wildlife Society, the American Fisheries Society, and the International Association for Society and Natural Resources, which is linked to the International Symposium for Society and Resource Management. I realize that the broad categorizations listed above have exclusions (e.g., economics, political science, and conservation psychology) and inevitably have individual exceptions. Regardless of their differences, these two traditions are contributing to an important understanding of human\u2013wildlife relationships and are also helping practitioners deal with day-to-day wildlife conservation and management issues.",

In many cases, wildlife managers deal with governmentally owned resources that are managed by government agencies. The North American model of natural resource management, to which many of these agencies subscribe, was established on the foundation of the public trust doctrine. This doctrine, which can be traced to Roman law, proposes resources common to humans \u2013 including air; running water; the sea; and, in North America, wildlife \u2013 should be held in trust for all people of the state. While the legality of public ownership of wildlife resources is debated (Bean & Rowland, 1997), state wildlife agencies are heavily influenced by the public trust philosophy (Prukop & Regan, 2005; Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, 2006). The doctrine is also often discussed in a more global context in relation to the management of natural resources (Sand, 2004).",

Across the many studies that I have conducted, the managers I work with are frequently surprised to learn about the views of the stakeholders they serve. For example, I conducted a study for the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW) in the early 1990s to examine public values toward wildlife (Bright, Manfredo, & Fulton, 2000). Findings had implications for CDOW\u2019s focus on regulating hunting and fishing in the state. Sales of hunting and fishing licenses are particularly important to CDOW because they provide a substantial portion of the annual operating budget of the agency. CDOW managers were surprised to learn from our study that about three out of ten citizens in Colorado did not support recreational hunting. How, you might ask, could these wildlife managers be unaware that so many people felt this way? In part, it is because our impression of others is formed largely through our interactions with those we frequently come in contact with. Managers are more likely to come in contact with the most vocal stakeholders or those who are directly affected by managers decisions, for example hunters and anglers. Past studies document this tendency and show that managers are often poor judges of the opinions of the general publics the managers serve (e.g., Gigliotti & Harmoning, 2004). This fact underscores the importance of actively engaging in representative assessment and inclusion of publics in natural resource decisions.",

At the most generic level, this approach proposes a process in which goals are set, alternative means of reaching them are evaluated, and an alternative is selected based on an analysis of consequences. The preferred alternative is then implemented, monitored, and evaluated. While there are many positive aspects of this model, one of its criticisms is its emphasis upon extensive scientific information provided through studies or by the manager who is trained in science. This heavy emphasis on data generation can be seen in early proposals on wildlife planning by pioneers of wildlife management such as King (1938). The fallacy of this approach has been the impossibility of obtaining complete information about the ramifications of a management decision. It also sets up unrealistic expectations that the manager could be the authoritative source of such extensive knowledge or expertise. As noted in Bailey, Elder, and McKinney\u2019s edited volume on wildlife conservation (1974, p. 577), \u201cCollege training of wildlife biologists often emphasizes theory and the rational-comprehensive method of decision making.

Rapidly modernizing countries, such as China and India, and expanding global economies are placing incredible pressure on the world\u2019s natural resources (Harris, 2003). Global climate change looms over all plans for the future. Despite an increasing awareness of consequences, the trajectory of climate change seems to be intensifying. China is expected to surpass the United States in carbon emissions by 2009 (Energy Information Administration, 2006), and these emissions will continue to increase. Between 2000 and 2020, the Chinese government expects a quadrupling of the country\u2019s GDP, and it has already been exceeding expectations toward that goal.",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, & Hanson, 2007) recently estimated that if temperatures rise by just 2\u20134\u00b0F, one-third of the world\u2019s species will be lost from their current range; they will either migrate elsewhere to escape rising temperatures or simply vanish. What demographic shift might accompany the shift in habitable lands and lands available for agriculture? What will be the status of protected areas, and how effective will we be in preserving biodiversity? At what point will changing public needs make politicians look to protected areas to solve issues of scarcity of agricultural land, habitable land, and essential commodities? These are, indeed, difficult challenges for which, I believe, we desperately need the involvement of the social sciences. To illustrate, what we learn through the social sciences can help us: develop effective ways of communicating with and affecting the behavior of publics; determine ways to engage in effective action for the common good; develop political structures that can react more effectively to pressing environmental threats; understand the various types of services provided by biodiversity and healthy, functioning ecosystems, and help us establish mechanisms for sustaining these services; understand and avoid negative social impacts from resource uses and resource policies across multiple geographic scales; and, with the help of ecological and biophysical knowledge, predict future occurrences under different scenarios.",

At the individual level (micro level), human response to wildlife is seen as a learned response drawing upon a foundation of inherited tendencies such as anthropomorphizing. Human response to wildlife is based on a complex mix of emotions and cognitions. In the cognitive domain, human thought is viewed structurally as building from the basic (values) to specific (attitudes) with a strong influence from social group involvement (norms). At a societal/cultural level, the behavior and cognitive makeup of individuals has material and symbolic associations. The cognitive structure of people within a society is in an adaptive relationship with material factors such as economy, demography, and the environment.",

For the vast majority of human history, wildlife have been linked in some way to our survival needs including safety, security, shelter, and sustenance. It is highly likely that the nature of evolved human characteristics was shaped by the threats and opportunities provided by wildlife. Today, situations eliciting human responses of surprise and fear from wildlife encounters might be the most obvious examples of inherited responses to wildlife. However, it is quite likely that most human responses toward wildlife build upon a foundation of inherited tendencies. Co-author David Fulton and I explore research that suggests there are human universals that shape response to wildlife as well as the notion that heritability explains individual differences in human response to wildlife.",

While some theorists emphasize and define emotion by physiological reactions and responses, others emphasize the role of cognition and comprehension, or the role of culture in fashioning emotion. Emotion and related topics, such as mood and affect, have been overlooked as a topic of study during much of the twentieth century because they were seen as a deterrent to rational thought. More recently, research shows that emotion is an essential part of sound decision making. It also affects group processes and conflict resolution, the storage and recall of memories, and persuasion and attitude change. While emotion theorists often use wildlife\u2013human interaction situations to illustrate emotional response (for example, a bear chasing a human), research examining human emotional response to wildlife is sparse. The experience of encounters with wildlife, people\u2019s attractions and interest in wildlife, and the intensity of conflict over wildlife are imbued with varying types and degrees of emotion. If we are to understand the individual meanings of wildlife to people, it is essential to attain a better understanding of emotion in human\u2013wildlife relationships.",

Wildlife are the focus of a significant amount of tourism and recreation that generates considerable economic impact. Human\u2013wildlife conflict is also a concern. It threatens human safety and creates considerable economic costs. Wildlife are a source of many human diseases. Globalization and climate change may increase the threat from emerging zoonotic diseases. There is widespread concern for the health of wildlife populations. The health of these populations is part of a broad concern for environmental quality and sustainability.The field of study known as human dimensions of wildlife has emerged to provide information about stakeholder concerns and values about wildlife. This field of study has developed along two lines. The first was associated with the North American tradition of wildlife management, the second through long-standing interest of anthropology and geography in human\u2013wildlife relationships. These two traditions differ in terms of methods used, geographic focus, level of advocacy, and disciplinary orientation.The human dimensions sciences can offer unique contributions to wildlife conservation. They can provide information that helps decision makers understand the interests of stakeholders and meet the public trust doctrine. They can direct attention to the social ramification of wildlife decisions and moral obligations related to negative impacts of policy decisions. They facilitate learning about stakeholders and repeatedly show we cannot trust our personal perceptions of public preference. They increase our awareness that we can facilitate conservation goals through the inclusion of local indigenous knowledge. They show how engaging public builds social capital which facilitates effective decisions. Finally, use of the social sciences will lead to better (longer lasting, reach desired outcomes, less controversial) short- and long-term decisions.Among the many social science perspectives, this book focuses on a cognitive approach to examining human\u2013wildlife relationships. The core of the cognitive approach \u2013 values, value orientations, attitudes, and norms \u2013 is extended by linking it to topics of heritability, emotions, and cultural-level forces of cognitive shift.The book proceeds on the assumption that improvements in application of social science concepts will lead to better social science information. That, in turn, will lead to better decisions about wildlife.\n",
