            "text": "more significant compare to quantitative analysis. Hence a suitable math-27 ematical model would not only able to represent the whole disease system 28 but also the study of the model would undoubtedly derive the precise nature 29 of the disease. It may forecast the behavioral aspect of the disease shortly. 30 Although the primitive mathematical models on theoretical epidemiology 31 (see Bernoulli [1] , Hamer[13] , Ross[40] . Kermack According to the information received, it may take around one week to two 41 weeks for the exposure of symptoms of COVID-19 of an infected person, 42 although during this period, that person able to infect other susceptible per-43 sons. However, there may be some infected persons whose infection is so mild 44 that the person would recover due to innate immunity even before the hos-45 pitalization. Thus in this article, by the term 'infected' person, we will mean 46 those persons who are hospitalized. Further, we assume that the medical 47 personals assisting COVID-19 positive hospitalized individuals have taken 48 necessary protective items. Thus to keep simplicity, we believe that only 49 exposed persons and asymptomatic infected persons can spread the disease. Since here, we have assumed that the virus of COVID-19 is spreading when 122 a vulnerable person comes into contact with an exposed person; therefore 123 we think that \u03c1 1 (0 < \u03c1 1 < 1) portion of susceptible human would maintain 124 proper precaution measure and \u03c1 2 (0 < \u03c1 2 < 1) portion of the exposed class 125 would take proper precaution measure for disease transmission (i.e., use of 126 face mask, social distancing and implementing hygiene). Therefore the dis-127 ease can only be transmitted to the (1\u2212\u03c1 1 )S portion of susceptible individuals 128 due to the contact of (1\u2212\u03c1 2 )E portion of exposed individuals with a bi-linear 129 disease transmission rate \u03b2. We know that a person is whether infected by 130 the SARS-CoV-2 virus or not can be clinically detected using RT-PCR ex-131 amination and a person with negative results in the RT-PCR test may still 132 be COVID-19 positive as it may take some days (from 7 to 21 days) to ex-133 press infection. Therefore, the portion with positive COVID-19 of the class 134 of population E is considered as infected, and they are hospitalized. Let \u03b1 135 and b 2 be the portions of the exposed class goes to the infected class and 136 quarantine class, respectively. It should be noted that 0 < \u03b1 + b 2 < 1 since 137 it would take quite a long time to get the output of the RT-PCR test, and 138 sometimes it requires more than one RT-PCR analysis for a single person for confirmation of COVID-19. Let among the quarantine classes of populations, 140 cQ portion of communities move to infected level, and the b 1 Q part would 141 become susceptible to the disease after the quarantine period. Let \u03b7 and \u03c3 142 be respectively recovery rate of the hospitalized infected populations I and 143 exposed class E. Let d be the natural death rate, which is common to all 144 classes of communities and \u03b4 be the COVID-19 induced death rate. Also, it 145 is statistically observed a person once recovered from the disease COVID-19 146 has very little chance to become infected again for the same disease. Hence, 147 we assume that no portion of the recovered population moves to the sus- consisting of five first order differential equations shown as below: Proof We assume that P = S + E + Q + I + R.",

Based on those five state variables, we aim to form 114 an autonomous system using first-order differential equations. Let A be the 115 constant recruitment rate to the susceptible population, and \u03b2 be the dis-116 ease transmission rate. However the disease transmission from vulnerable to 117 infected persons (here the class E) depends on several parameters, namely, 118 precautions (use of face mask, social distancing, not rubbing face and nose 119 using hand, etc.) and hygienic environment (use of soap and sanitizer, hand 120 washing, cleaning, etc.) taken by both susceptible as well as infected persons.",

Also, in the formulation of a mathematical model, we 149 understand that the people of the hospitalized infected class (i.e., I(t)) would 150 not be spreading the disease or spreading a negligible amount of disease since 151 they are kept completely isolated from the susceptible individuals. However, 152 to control the pandemic COVID-19, suitable governmental measures (like 153 complete or semi lockdown, rationing system, continue media coverage on 154 social isolation and improvement of public hygiene, home deliveries of essen-155 tial commodities, to make an alternate source of income for job-losers during 156 the lockdown, etc.) have been implemented by the various governmental and 157 non-governmental agencies. Thus this policy may be considered as one of the 158 effective control tools, and mainly the susceptible population of COVID-19 159 cases would be benefited due to this policy. Mathematically we represent 160 this policy by the parameter M and let this policy be implemented at a rate 161 p. Therefore due to the implementation of this policy, the portion, pSM 162 moves from susceptible to the recovered or removed class (R(t)). It should 163 be noted that usually, the parameter M should be time-dependent as for the 164 optimum result, the policy should be applied according to the necessity of the 165 situation and keeping a proper balance between two different states, namely 166 lockdown and complete free state. However, in the qualitative analysis of 167 this model, we assume the parameter M as time-independent, but in for-168 mulating an optimal control problem to keep the infected individuals at the 169 minimum level, M is assumed as a time-dependent control M (t), where in-170 deed 0 \u2264 M (t) \u2264 1.

In-393 dia, the second most populated country, has also been affected severely due 394 to the global pandemic COVID-19. In this paper, we analyze the effect of 395 COVID-19 cases in three states in three different parts of India. These states 396 are the Western state Maharashtra (where the commercial capital of India, 397 Mumbai situated), the northern state Delhi (where the capital of India, New 398 Delhi is located), and the southern state Tamil Nadu (where another highly 399 populated mega-city, Chennai is situated) and the some of total populations 400 of these three states crossing two hundred millions. We apply the model 401 system (1) to study the pandemic situation due to COVID-19 in these three 402 states of India from 2nd March, 2020 to 27th April 2020 and predict the 403 future behavior of the disease in a short term basis. Although the first case 404 of COVID-19 in India was confirmed in the state Kerala on 30th January 405 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the state of Delhi, Tamil 406 Nadu, and Maharashtra respectively on 2nd, 7th, and 9th March 2020.

On the other hand, it should be noted that the estimated 490 values of COVID-19 in the three different states of India in three different 491 parts are forecasted using existing parametric space only. In the case of the 492 first two states, Maharashtra and Delhi we see that the graph shows an in-493 creasing trend whereas for the state Tamil Nadu, the predicted data shows 494 that the disease can be controlled with the existing parametric space. The 495 main two burdens behind the control of COVID-19 are (i) the unconscious-496 ness of the people about the disease and (ii) the high population density 497 exposed the infection when the common people are out for their essential 498 commodities. Moreover, the weakness of forecasting cumulative COVID-19 499 cases in the three states of India is that here the forecast is done on totally 500 some existing parametric conditions. But human behaviour is the most un-501 certain phenomena. Hence, if the corresponding parametric space has been 502 altered then there may be some changes in the graphs of COVID-19 cases. 503 Therefore, in this article, we are targeting to forecast the COVID-19 cases on 504 a short term basis and henceforth there would be very little chance to change 505 in corresponding parametric space. But the framework of the current model 506 gives some important insights into the dynamics of COVID-19 spread and 507 control. Further, our simulation works suggest that both the quarantine and 508 governmental intervention strategies like lockdown, media coverage on so-509 cial distancing and public hygiene can play an important role in diminishing 510 COVID-19 transmission. However, the successes of these strategies mainly 511 rely on the proper implementation of the process. In our future work, we 512 need to extend our model by incorporating some essential biological as well 513 as epidemiological factors.
