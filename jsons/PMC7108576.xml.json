Moreover, PMO is being used extensively as a tool for selective inhibition of gene expression in cell culture models. However, the poor delivery of the PMO limits the application of PMO-mediated therapy for DMD or other muscular dystrophies. At present the precise mechanism of PMO entry into dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers is still unknown (11,12). A dominant hypothesis is that PMO enters dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers as a result of abnormal membrane permeability, a so-called \u2018leaky membrane\u2019 (13,14).",

Our in vitro studies of C2C12 myoblasts suggest that PMO or 2\u2032OMePS is taken up preferentially into muscle cells during the process of myotube formation. We also tested the therapeutic potential of PMO treatment on the dy3K/dy3K mouse (16): a model of laminin-\u03b12 chain (merosin)-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) (MIM156225) with active muscle regeneration. Our results support the idea that PMO entry into muscle fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on an intrinsic defect in the membrane of dystrophinless muscle fibers: the \u2018leaky-membrane\u2019 hypothesis. As such it provides a platform for developing PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration.",

Next, we injected PMO 51Do (400 \u00b5g/kg body weight) into both tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mdx52 mice aged 3\u201332 weeks to induce exon 51 skipping (Fig. 1C) and evaluated the extent of dystrophin expression by immunohistochemistry. Two weeks after the injection, the TA muscles were isolated and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers was 45% on average when PMO was injected at 4 weeks and approximately 20% when PMO was injected from 6 to 32 weeks (Fig. 1D and E).

We injected into TA muscle of mdx52 mice aged 5 and 32 weeks. Mice were killed 2 weeks after the PMO injection and TA muscles were removed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for dystrophin, BrdU and DAPI (Fig. 2A). We found that dystrophin-positive fibers could be classified into two types: BrdU-positive small-caliber fibers with diameters of 30\u201340 \u00b5m and BrdU-negative normal-caliber fibers with diameters of 40\u201360 \u00b5m at 5 and 32 weeks in mdx52 mice (Fig. 2B and C). The total numbers of dystrophin-positive fibers were significantly higher in the mice injected with PMO at 5 weeks than at 32 weeks and the proportion that were of BrdU-positive, small-caliber fibers was also significantly greater (Fig. 2D). Then, we injected PMO (320 mg/kg) into the tail vein of mdx52 mice at 5 weeks, which were administered of BrdU in the drinking water (0.8 mg/ml) for 6 days, and performed immunohistochemistry for dystrophin, BrdU and DAPI 2 weeks after the injection (Fig. 2E). A significantly large number of BrdU-positive fibers (303/314, 96.50%) exclusively expressed dystrophin compared with the BrdU-negative fibers (185/943, 19.62%) (P < 0.001 by Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 2F).

The percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3B and C) and dystrophin expression level by western blotting (Fig. 3D and E) peaked in muscles where PMO had been injected at 4 days after CTX injection. On histology, the TA muscle BrdU and eMHC double-positive small-caliber fibers were seen at high levels at 4 days after CTX injection (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4).

Next, PMO 51Do (320 mg/kg) targeting the splice donor site of exon 51 was injected into the tail vein of 5-week WT mice 4 days after injection of CTX into their TA muscles (Fig. 4C).

Then, we transduced C2C12 myotubes with 10 \u00b5m PMO 51Do at 24, 48, 168 or 336 h after the medium change. We also tested the uptake period of 1 \u00b5m 2\u2032OMePS, which is one of the commonly investigated oligonucleotides chemistries used for targeting the intraexonic site of exon 51. Undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts after 10 \u00b5m PMO or 1 \u00b5m 2\u2032OMePS were used as controls.

Skipping exon 4 of the murine Lama2 gene in dy3K/dy3K mice corrects the open reading frame and could lead to the production of a truncated laminin-\u03b12 chain (Fig. 7A). We first identified effective AO sequences in dy3k/dy3k fibroblasts. We designed seven AO sequences targeting either exonic sequences or exon\u2013intron junctions of the murine Lama2 exon 4 (Fig. 7B; sequences in Table 3). We then transfected one or two of the seven AOs (10 \u00b5m in total) into dy3k/dy3k fibroblasts (17). After 48 h incubation, we analyzed RNA fractions by RT\u2013PCR using the primers described in Supplementary Material, Figure S6. Among the AOs examined, PMO 4B plus 4D were shown to be capable of inducing exon 4 skipping at a level approaching 80%, the highest among the combinations that we examined by RT\u2013PCR (Fig. 7C and D). 4B and 4D were designed to target the exonic sites of exon 4. We therefore injected the combination of two AOs (400 \u00b5g/kg body weight) into the TA muscles of dy3K/dy3K mice at age 10 days. Fifteen days later, TA muscles were obtained and analyzed by RT\u2013PCR and immunohistochemistry. We found by RT\u2013PCR that 4B plus 4D could induce exon 4 skipping (Fig. 8A). We confirmed correct exon 4 skipping by direct sequencing of the RT\u2013PCR products (Fig. 8B). Moreover, up to 20% of fiber membranes were laminin-\u03b12 positive by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 8C). After intraperitoneal injection (150 mg/kg in total) of the 2-PMO combination into dy3K/dy3K mice at postnatal at age 10 days, we found that 4B plus 4D could induce exon 4 skipping by RT\u2013PCR (Fig. 8D). Our study results showed a trend toward improvement in life span of PMO-treated dy3k/dy3k mice compared with saline-treated dy3K/dy3K mice (Fig. 8E). These data suggest the potential of PMO-mediated therapy targeting myotubes for MDC1A.\n",

This hypothesis is based on the clinical evidence that dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers are prone to be injured by contraction and that the injury causes leakage of soluble cytoplasmic proteins such as creatine kinase (26,27). In addition, it is reported that intravenously delivered PMO shows very poor delivery to normal muscle, while dystrophin-deficient muscle or intramuscular injection in normal muscle shows good delivery (28). Further, Evans blue, a low molecular-weight diazo dye which has a very high affinity for serum albumin, does not cross into skeletal muscle fibers in normal mice but mdx mice, a dystrophin-deficient animal model for DMD, show significant Evans blue accumulation in skeletal muscle fibers (29,30).",

To overcome this delivery issue with PMO, recent developments using cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated PMO, where a short cationic peptides that penetrate cells by interacting with the negatively charged plasma membrane, may become an effective strategy for reducing both dose levels and administration frequencies (33\u201336). But we still face issues of off-target effects or high toxicity in humans because of the nonspecific delivery-facilitated properties and the facilitated interactions with other proteins (37\u201340). Therefore, it is important to understand the detailed mechanisms of PMO entry into muscle fibers to improve the poor delivery of PMO and optimize it as a therapeutic intervention for DMD or other muscular diseases.",

            "text": "In this study, we found that exon 51 skipping was induced dose dependently in mdx52 mice but that no skipping was induced in WT mice after systemic injection of PMO (640 mg/kg). This finding conforms the \u2018leaky membrane hypothesis\u2019. However, PMO was most efficiently taken up into eMHC-positive regenerating fibers at 4 days following CTX injection into TA muscles, which express dystrophin at the muscle plasma membrane in WT mice. The degeneration\u2013regeneration process induced by CTX injection was well documented as follows: after CTX injection, satellite cell proliferation occurs within 2 days, myogenic differentiation is initiated within 3 days, new myotube formation is evident within 5 days and muscle architecture is largely restored within 10 days (41). Taken together, our in vivo study by CTX injection suggests PMO uptake is more prominent during stages from myogenic differentiation to myotube formation than cell proliferation stage. We also showed that PMO and 2\u2032OMePS is taken up efficiently in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. These data suggest that the uptake mechanism is not simply attributable to a change in membrane permeability but also involves an unknown mechanism in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. It is reported that PMO internalization in uptake-permissive cells is specific, saturable and energy dependent, suggesting a receptor-mediated mechanism (22). These data suggest that immature regenerated fibers, which are called myotubes, could take up PMO more efficiently than mature fibers. In consequence, we confirmed that there is already a leaky gateway into dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers. But more importantly, these findings provide a conceptual advance in that it supports the idea that PMO entry into muscle fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on an intrinsic defect in the dystrophin-deficient muscle membrane: the \u2018leaky-membrane\u2019 hypothesis. As such it provides a platform for developing PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration.",

            "text": "To test the potential of PMO treatment targeting myotube formation, we used the dy3K/dy3K mouse which is a model of MDC1A. The dy3K/dy3K mice, with a pMC1neo polyA+ cassette in exon 4 of the Lama2 gene, are a null mutant for the laminin-\u03b12 chain which is a major component of basal lamina in skeletal muscle and the peripheral nervous system (16). In man, the laminin-\u03b12 chain consists of six domains (I\u2013VI) and exon 4 of the LAMA2 gene encodes a part of domain VI, which are predicted to form N-terminal globular (LN) structures (Supplementary Material, Fig. S7A) (42). The LN structures are essential for laminin aggregation into supramolecular networks and consequently for incorporation into basement membranes, thus mutations in this structures reduce the capacity of polymer formation (43). Another merosin-deficient mouse, the dy2J/dy2J mouse, harbors a mutation in the LN structures which leads only to slightly reduced expression of a laminin-\u03b12 chain partially lacking these structures and thus displays a relatively mild muscular dystrophy and peripheral neuropathy (44). Therefore, we hypothesized that PMO-mediated exon 4 skipping could act to rescue dy3K/dy3K mice. In this study, we successfully confirmed the recovery of laminin-\u03b12 chain by skipping of the mutated exon 4. Our data suggest that PMO, which was taken up into muscle fibers, may induce exon 4 skipping in dy3K/dy3K mice. More importantly, PMO-mediated exon 4 skipping has a real potential to become an effective therapy for MDC1A, since two nonsense mutations in exon 4 such as 547G > ANN166X and 677C > T/210X can cause MDC1A (45). Furthermore, half of the patients with congenital muscular dystrophy in European populations have mutations of the LAMA2 gene (42), our data could offer a hope to patients struggling with the disease.",
