The matrix (M) segment regulates the replication of influenza A virus, thereby affecting its virulence and pathogenicity. This study found that the M segment of the Spanish flu virus is a recombinant chimera originating from avian influenza virus and human influenza virus. The unique mosaic M segment might confer the virus high replication capacity, showing that the recombination might play an important role in inducing high pathogenicity of the virus. In addition, this study also suggested that the NA and NS segments of the virus were generated by reassortment between mammalian and avian viruses. Direct phylogenetic evidence was also provided for its avian origin.",

The open reading frames (ORFs) of the M1 and M2 genes share the first nine codons at the N-terminus, and the C-terminus of M1 overlaps with a region of M2. M1 consists of 252 AAs, while M2 consists of 97 AAs encoded by an alternatively spliced transcript. Lining the inner layer of the viral membrane and contacting the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core, M1 is highly conserved and is the most abundant protein in viral particles (Reid, Fanning, Janczewski, McCall, & Taubenberger, 2002) . M1 regulates the nuclear export of viral RNPs (Bui, Wills, Helenius, & Whittaker, 2000; Martin & Helenius, 1991) , restricts viral replication (Liu & Ye, 2002) , inhibits viral transcription in the late stages of infection and the switch from replication to viral assembly (Perez & Donis, 1998; Ye, Baylor, & Wagner, 1989 ) and influences virus assembly and budding (Gomez-Puertas, Albo, Perez-Pastrana, Vivo, & Portela, 2000; Helenius, 1992; Latham & Galarza, 2001) . Anchored in the viral envelope, M2 serves as a transmembrane ion channel (Lamb, Zebedee, & Richardson, 1985; Sugrue & Hay, 1991) and plays key roles in both virion uncoating and viral budding (Grambas & Hay, 1992; Pinto, Holsinger, & Lamb, 1992) .",

However, the Spanish flu virus has multiple proteins carrying the unique AAs of the avian branch, suggesting its progenitors had infected avian before its outbreak; and thus, the mutations adaptive to birds might have been fixed in virus genome during circulation in avian host (Basler et al., 2001; Reid et al., , 2004 Reid et al., , 2000 Taubenberger et al., 2005) . Interestingly, in this study, by introducing a bird IVA lineage isolated in the early 20th century into the dataset, we found that the NA and NS segments of the Spanish flu virus are more likely from avian IVA. Moreover, approximately 300 nt fragment of its M segment is also inherited from avian IVA. These results provided direct evidence for the avian origin of the virus.",

Even for negative RNA viruses, recombination has also been responsible for outbreaks of bovine ephemeral fever virus in cattle (He et al., 2016) , bat rabies virus in skunk and raccoon (Ding, Xu, Sun, He, & He, 2017) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus in human . For the Spanish flu virus, Gibbs et al., (2001) . proposed its HA was recombined from human and swine IVAs, and the recombination played the key role in the outbreak of the virus. However, this recombination evidence was thought to be invalid because the phylogenetic histories of HA were not different in the regions inside and outside the proposed recombination breakpoints (Worobey et al., 2002) . Here, we provided robust phylogenetic evidence that the M segment was a chimera inherited from a human virus and a bird virus, showing that homologous recombination does be the important genetic mechanism driving the formation of the Spanish flu virus, although recombination might infrequently occur between IVAs.",

Here, we found that the recombination has shaped a new M segment that is significantly different from any avian and mammalian IVAs, which may give the virus a unique biological phenotype. It has been known that the disease course and pathological damage caused by the virus are associated with the capability of replicating to titers higher than those of other strains (Wolbach, 1919) . The M protein is the regulator of IVA growth (Yasuda, Bucher, & Ishihama, 1994; Yasuda, Toyoda, Nakayama, & Ishihama, 1993) . Small changes in M can have large effects on replication phenotype (Reid et al., 2002) . M can also affect the virulence of the virus (Brown, Liu, Kit, Baird, & Nesrallah, 2001; Smeenk, Wright, Burns, Thaker, & Brown, 1996) . Through the recombination, the Spanish flu virus acquired the seven unique AAs from the avian IVA in M1 and M2. Previous studies have shown that the mosaic proteins might have given the Spanish flu virus a high replication capacity. The recombinant M segments of its offspring strains PR34 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)) and WSN33 (A/WSN/33 (H1N1)) ( Figure S2 ) have been shown to confer high-growth characteristics in single-gene reassortant strains (Yasuda et al., 1994) , suggesting that the recombination may give the Spanish flu virus a high replication power, and thus, influence its pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Figure 1). Using the horse flu viruses as the control group and the Spanish flu virus as the query, we compared the M sequence of the Spanish flu virus with those of human and avian flu viruses and discovered the crossover site between human and avian viruses in the M segment of the Spanish flu virus. Before the site, the Spanish flu virus had higher similarity with the human viruses; otherwise it was more like the bird viruses (Figure 2a). Using the Spanish flu virus as the query to compare the M segment polymorphic sites of human and avian flu viruses, this contradiction in sequence similarity signal became clearer (Figure 2a). Interestingly, bootscan analysis gave two putative breakpoints (Figure 2b). These results suggested that the M segment of the Spanish flu virus might be a recombinant from human and avian flu viruses. Then, choosing one representative isolate of human, avian and horse flu viruses (Figure 2b), respectively, we employed Fisher's exact test to analyze information sites so as to determine the robustness of the potential recombination breakpoints. Of the two putative breakpoints with Maximum chi-square value, the first one (position 590 in the M1 ORF) was statistically significant (p < 0.05), whereas the second one (position 894) was not because there were not enough information sites after it.To further determine this recombination event, we reconstructed the phylogenetic history of the M segment using different regions delimited by the putative breakpoints. Before the first breakpoint, the Spanish flu virus was clustered into the human H1N1 lineage with 100% bootstrap support(Figure 3a). Inside the two breakpoints; however, it was nested in the clade of the bird viruses with 93% bootstrap value(Figure 3b). The topologies of the two trees were significantly different (Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, p < 0.0001).",

During circulation in avian host, the virus obtained the NA and NS segments via reassortment and the 300 nt M segment through recombination from avian IVAs, and later jumped back to humans and caused the devastating pandemic. However, it is difficult to trace when the recombination event in the M segment took place because the real parents of the Spanish flu virus cannot be identified. Therefore, we are not sure to what extent this recombination affected the virus. Recent studies have showed that both the HA and PB2 proteins of the Spanish flu virus can enhance viral replication.
