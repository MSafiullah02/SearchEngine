Western lifestyle seems to be associated with an increased prevalence of allergic disorders in general, including asthma and eczema. Studies to identify the exact genes involved are still limited in AR, and the findings have been difficult to interpret because of lack of replication in separate population cohorts.

            "text": "The key immunologic event that initiates AR is binding of allergen to specific IgE on mast cells found in the nasal mucosa. Cross-linking of two or more high-affinity IgE molecules in response to allergen binding leads to mast cell activation and degranulation with release of mediators, initiating an immune cascade (Figure 37-3\n). This is termed the immediate response. With the release of histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and other mediators (platelet-activating factor, substance P, tachykinins) comes the immediate onset of symptoms of sneezing, itching, and \u201crunning,\u201d typically seen in instances of intermittent allergen contact\u2014for example, with hay fever. An additional immunologic event in up to 70% of affected persons is a further influx of inflammatory cells consisting predominantly of eosinophils, basophils, and T cells expressing TH2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 (B cell IgE class switching) and IL-13 (mucus hypersecretion). Clinically this process is characterized by further obstruction, decreased olfaction, and mucosal irritability with immunopathologic changes similar to those seen in chronic asthma (see Figure 37-3). Local mucosal allergen\u2013specific IgE production by nasal B cells is now confirmed and leads to local (skin prick test\u2013negative) rhinitis. Emerging evidence also indicates that activated nasal epithelium\u2013derived cytokines such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25 (i.e., IL-17E), and IL-33 can further promote disease through initiation, enhancement, and maintenance of TH2 inflammation at the mucosal surface where allergen deposition and sampling occur. In addition, the potential for innate mucosal immune mechanisms such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling system to drive or skew TH2 responses is increasingly recognized.",

The major house dust mite allergen Der p 2 is now recognized as demonstrating molecular mimicry to the mammalian lipid-binding protein (LBP) MD-2. This feature allows Der p 2 to bind bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) airway TLR-4 signaling complex, which is highly expressed on epithelium, and facilitates TLR signaling. Such signaling is important for the development of allergen-driven TH2 signaling pathways. Allergy to dander from domestic pets (such as cats, dogs, rabbits, and hamsters) can account for perennial rhinitis, whereas allergens encountered in the workplace are responsible for occupational rhinitis. Examples are sensitization to latex, flour, and grain (bakers); allergies to small mammals among laboratory workers; and allergy to wood dust, biologic products (such as antibiotic powder and enzyme-enhanced detergents), and rosin (colophony) from solder flux.",

However, mixed rhinitis (a combination of allergic and nonallergic forms) can occur in up to 44% to 87% of patients. NAR incidence is higher in women. The nonallergic form of rhinitis incorporates a very heterogeneous group of conditions, and it is possible to further subclassify NAR into etiologic subtypes: a group for which the etiology is known and one for which it cannot be established, termed idiopathic rhinitis. The latter type is a diagnosis of exclusion, and approximately 60% of NAR cases will fall into this category. A summary of considerations in the differential diagnosis for NAR is presented in Box 37-1\n.

It typically is rapidly responsive to topical nasal corticosteroids. Recent progress in identifying local airway mucosal production of allergen-specific IgE has implications for future disease classification, and an entity termed local allergic rhinitis (LAR) has been described recently. What overlap NARES will have with LAR is not yet defined, but it is likely that with further investigation of these two NAR subtypes, common disease mechanisms will be found and the classification terminology will change further.",

Mast cell and eosinophil degranulation are seen in biopsy specimens, and polyclonal local IgE production stimulated by superantigens from staphylococci has been described. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition by aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) promotes leukotriene production, while inhibiting that of prostaglandins, including PGE2, a bronchodilator. Leukotrienes cause bronchoconstriction, mucosal swelling, and excess mucus production, and sensitivity to their effects is high in aspirin sensitivity, probably because of increased numbers of specific receptors. The clinical picture often is one of aggressive eosinophilic polyposis, severe asthma with life-threatening reactions to aspirin and other NSAIDs, and frequent need for oral corticosteroids.

            "text": "The nasal mucosa receives a rich efferent innervation from both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. Nasal glandular secretion is largely mediated by the parasympathetic fibers, the main postganglionic neurotransmitter being acetylcholine (ACh) acting through muscarinic receptors (predominantly the M3 subtype). The sympathetic fibers mediate vascular tone and can regulate nasal airflow by potent effects on venous erectile tissue. The primary neurotransmitter is norepinephrine (noradrenaline). In autonomic rhinitis, there is no evidence of nasal inflammation, but of autonomic dysfunction or imbalance. Nasal and, in some patients, cardiovascular reflexes are abnormal, and there may be association with the chronic fatigue syndrome. Topical ipratropium is useful in decreasing watery rhinorrhea; capsaicin applications also may relieve symptoms for several months after a few weeks of treatment. Epinephrine (adrenaline) and other sympathomimetics lead to vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa, with increased nasal patency. Both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic blockers increase nasal resistance and can produce symptoms of nasal stuffiness (Box 37-2\n). Stimulation of the parasympathetic system leads to an increase in nasal secretions. However, patients who have this condition also have increased responsiveness to both histamine and methacholine, which results in nasal blockage and rhinorrhea. It also is associated with hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates, and nasal polyps are sometimes present. Certain stimuli such as cold air, exercise, mechanical or thermal factors, and humidity changes result in rhinorrhea and other symptoms of rhinitis, and a period of nasal hyperresponsiveness often follows viral infection. This observation is consistent with general neuronal dysregulation leading to excessive and troublesome neural hyperreactivity and imbalance with certain environmental exposures.Box 37-2Drugs Commonly Associated With Rhinitis*Known MechanismInflammatory\nAspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nNeuronal\n\nPeripherally acting sympatholytics:DoxazosinPrazosinIndoraminPhentolamineGuanethidine\n\nCentrally acting sympatholytics:MethyldopaClonidineReserpine\n\nGanglion-blocking sympatholytics:Trimethaphan\n\nVasodilator (phosphodiesterase inhibition)\nSildenafil\nUnknown Mechanism/IdiopathicPsychotropics\nChlordiazepoxideRisperidoneAmitriptyline\nAntihypertensives/Other\nBeta blockers (including ocular formulation)Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsCalcium channel blockersAmilorideHydralazine\nHormones\nEstrogen/oral contraceptives\n",

In early infancy, milk or egg allergy can cause rhinitis as part of a spectrum that can include atopic dermatitis, gut symptoms, asthma, and failure to thrive. AR is sometimes accompanied by the oral allergy syndrome, in which sensitization to pollen results in oral reactivity to the same components in fresh fruit and vegetables. In Northern Europe, the reactions usually are mild, typically consisting of itching of the lips, mouth, and throat on consumption of the offending food; cooked food is tolerated without reaction, because the major allergen involved is heat-labile profilin. Southern Europeans, however, in whom the immune system recognizes lipid transfer proteins, can experience more severe reactions, including anaphylaxis. Allergy to food may be confused with food intolerance (in which IgE-mediated mechanisms are not involved). Some foods are rich in histamines (e.g., cheese, some fish, some wines) that may result in flushing, headache, and rhinitis and the same may occur with tyramine-rich foods (e.g., bananas). Food additives and coloring agents (such as sulfites, benzoates, and tartrazine) also may provoke reactions, especially in aspirin-sensitive subjects.

Finally, emotional factors may play a part, ranging from stress to sexual arousal that compounds nasal blockage and discharge to emphatic or consistent complaints of gross nasal symptoms, despite the absence of abnormal findings on examination.
