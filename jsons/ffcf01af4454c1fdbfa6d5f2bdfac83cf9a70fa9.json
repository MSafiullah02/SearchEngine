Therefore, a closer examination of the SARS occurrences in space and time could provide a better understanding of the spatial diffusion patterns and possible environmental factors contributing to such patterns.

Such models, however, do not consider dynamic elements transpired by population mobility and social mixing; both of which are largely influenced by socioeconomic and environmental factors. Small and Tse [14] explained that these conventional models have an underlying assumption that each member of the entire population has an equal chance of being infected. Such an assumption ignores the complex socio-demographic and environmental factors afflicting the transmission course of a disease among various subgroups (e.g., the wealthy, middle class, and the disadvantaged). A typical mathematical model suggests that a disease epidemic would ultimately infect the entire population [10] [12] . The reality is that certain communities may be affected less by an epidemic. For example, SARS cases seemed to cluster in several disease \"hot spots\" in Hong Kong [15] . Jefferson et al. [16] also reported that simple physical interruptions, such as systematic education on personal hygiene and isolation of infected patients, were effective in preventing the spread of respiratory diseases. Hence, Dye and Gay [9] concluded that the next generation of disease models should include spatial processes and stochastic factors to tender a better solution to the problem.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 168, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1031, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1278, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\"Space\" as an Element in Disease Modelling"}, {"text": "The Geographic Information System (GIS) technology is well suited for analysing epidemiological data and characterising the spatio-temporal patterns of epidemics [15] [17] .

Efforts have been made to incorporate the dimension of space into disease simulation. Sattenspiel and Dietz [7] , for example, created an epidemic model that accounts for geographic mobility of the population in different regions. Despite the assumptions of a single trip and a static population, their model was regarded superior to the conventional SEIR models because it considered in calculating the transmission risk both epidemic and behavioural processes, as well as environmental factors. Small and Tse [8] modelled the spread of SARS using a small world model to simulate its spatial diffusion using the network structure. However, their model assumed that the environmental factors and population composition within the small world were homogenous. Meng et al. [18] tried to employ spatial analysis to investigate and understand factors affecting the spatial transmission process of SARS in Beijing. They identified population density as a significant factor for the spatial diffusion in this case.

We incorporated such data to investigate possible socio-economic factors that might have affected the spatial distribution of SARS. As the human-to-human transmission of SARS is through close contacts, variations in the socio-economic constructs by different spatial units might influence its spatial distributional patterns [4] . Grids of 150m x 150m were created. SARS data and census data were spatially joined to the grid level for analysis. We examined the relationship between the SARS incidence and the following socio-economic characteristics as stipulated in hypothesis 2 above. a) percentage of population with tertiary level education b) percentage of population aged under 15 c) percentage of population aged over 65 d) non-working population e) median household income f) median personal income g) average number of rooms per household h) net residential density We followed the Irish government's guidelines [22] when defining net residential density because there is no such guideline in Hong Kong. Non populated areas (such as country parks) were excluded in our analysis. The reason for not using population density directly is because many areas in Hong Kong are of the mixed land use type (e.g. inner city areas of Kowloon and northern Hong Kong Island where residential areas are mixed with commercial / retail uses). Moreover, some residential areas are also situated adjacent large plots of non populated country parks (please refer to Figure 3 for such situations in Kowloon and the Hong Kong Island) which are often included in the total area of specific administrative districts or planning units.

It appears that transport might have an essential role in facilitating disease spread. A previous study of SARS transmission in China also confirmed that modern public transport has a vital part in spreading contagious diseases like SARS [23] . The study reported that SARS had two major hotspots in Guangdong and provinces near Beijing. Intersections of national highway, in particular, were a high risk factor for the spatial diffusion of SARS. While an appropriate test of significance is not available, the visual evidence derived of the SARS data in our study does suggest that the null hypothesis 1 is not substantiated. Medical facilities could be another important contributor to the diffusion of SARS. More than 10 workers in room 8A of the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH), where the first SARS patient was admitted, were infected with SARS in early March [24] . Figure 1 shows that the Sha Tin district, where the PWH is located, was most severely affected by SARS during the first two phases of the epidemic in 2003. Confirmed cases in Sha Tin for phases 1 and 2 accounted for 34.9% (15 out of 43) and 28.2% (42 out of 149) of total SARS cases in Hong Kong. The close proximity of residents in Sha Tin to the PWH, which is the primary source of nosocomial infection, meant that they were at a higher risk of contracting SARS in the early phases of the epidemic. This is in line with Lau et al. [2] [3] who suggested that more than a quarter of the SARS patients in Hong Kong in 2003 were health care workers and hospital visit was a risk factor for contracting SARS.

Table  1 also shows that net residential density had a significant positive correlation with the occurrence of SARS. Figure 3 is a map of SARS cases plotted over residential density in the city centres of Hong Kong (Kowloon and the Hong Kong Island). It illustrates that disease cases were concentrated mostly in areas of high residential densities. Areas with lower residential densities in Figure 3 (such as 1 -Kowloon Tong, 2 -Southern District, and 3 -mid-levels) had fewer cases throughout the 2003 epidemic as shown in Figure 1 . This observation matches that of a study by Meng et al. [18] who demonstrated that population density was an important factor affecting the spatial diffusion of SARS in Beijing. The average number of rooms per household was also found to have a statistically significant negative correlation with SARS because this factor is likely associated with residential density. People must share a room with their family members given fewer rooms per household in places with a high residential density. The percent of elderly population (over 65 years old) was statistically significant at the less stringent 95% instead of 99% confidence level.
