The rise of recombinant DNA technology at this time opened the door to the possibility of creating synthetic genomes and organisms, and as such the field has its origins in metabolic and genetic engineering. However, the strength of synthetic biology has been the incorporation of a wide range of ideas from various disciplines including biological, chemical, and conventional engineering, systems biology, and protein design.",

First, these approaches are attempts to produce a system that is nonnatural but exhibits some aspect of natural behavior. Second, they derive from the engineering perspective that biology is modular. Modularity is reflected at many of the length scales at which natural systems are present, including individuals in a population, cells in a tissue, and proteins assembled into transcription machinery all the way down to the individual amino acids in a protein chain. It therefore makes sense to map out attempts to create synthetic biology with reference to the point in the natural hierarchy of structure at which alterations cause divergence from nature.2\n",

The synthetic chromosomes were injected into a host cell which had previously had all genetic material removed. The new DNA took control of the host cell's molecular machinery, causing them to produce progeny which contain only the synthetic chromosomes.5\n",

The fast growing properties of yeast can then be exploited to produce the drug in far higher quantities at a much lower cost. The critical feature of this approach is that biological pathways are modular and can be cut, transposed, and added to new organisms with a minimal amount of interference with existing pathways. The BioBricks project aims to put this on a sound engineering footing by producing a catalog of genetic building blocks whose properties are well defined and can be plugged into new contexts.8\n",

Ultimately, protocells might also have the ability to pass on their blueprint for the construction of successive generations.10., 11. Ideally, though bioinspired, none of these aspects would use natural biomolecules: that is, no DNA/RNA-based information stores or transfers; no carbohydrate-based or similar metabolism; no protein structures, binders, or catalysts; and though this appears to be a less stringent stipulation, no natural lipids as membrane components.",

First, they are easier to work with than \u03b2-strands as they are stabilized by local interactions. An isolated \u03b2-strand is generally not a stable chain configuration, as there are a great many \u201cdangling\u201d hydrogen bonds to be satisfied (see Fig. 2\n). To stabilize the strand, these bonds must be satisfied by another strand and/or other nearby secondary structural element. This property makes the \u03b2-sheet a nonlocal secondary structure as many nonadjacent areas of the peptide chain may be involved. These considerations mean that de novo design of all but the simplest \u03b2-sheet structures can require a predictive knowledge of the behavior of the entire peptide, something that is not currently possible. However, a single helix can be stable individually, with the hydrogen bond network formed between amino acids that are near to each other in the primary sequence. Specifically, the hydrogen bonds are formed between the carbonyl oxygen of residue i and the amide proton of residue i\n + 4.",

These are small pieces of sequence that can fold independently into helical fragments before the oligomerization of the coiled coil occurs. It has recently been shown that, in the case of GCN4, the insertion of trigger sequences specifying oligomeric state may be more important than the use of individual specifying residues in determining the final structure.37 Overall, the current situation is that caution must still be applied when designed peptides are required to exhibit a specific oligomerization state, and that experimental verification of structure is prudent.",

These proteins are of interest to the design process because they exhibit various levels of specificity: that is to say, many of the sequences bind preferentially to only a few partner sequences in the collection. This specificity is a key property necessary in making designed self-assembly that is modular and not promiscuous. An interactome for bZIP proteins has been mapped out by Keating and colleagues using a microscale protein array technique, in which the interactions of 49 human bZIP proteins and 10 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were measured.41 This technique involves printing plates with each of the proteins under conditions in which they are expected to be monomeric, and then exposing the plates to fluorescently labeled analogs of each of the proteins. The resulting level of fluorescence retained on the plate is used to calculate the interaction strength (Fig. 6\n).",

The idea is that a synthetic peptide that could outcompete either half of this interaction would be useful as a drug. In this work, the technique of protein-fragment complementation assays combined with growth competition was used to produce optimized binding partners for both the wild-type Fos and Jun (see Fig. 7\n). The library used in the assay was constructed semirationally using information from the families of Fos and Jun and knowledge of coiled-coil interactions. The winning peptides from the library had higher melting temperatures when mixed with their wild-type partners than the natural interaction, as well as an even tighter heterodimeric interaction with each other.",

One type of SNARE is associated with a transport vesicle; the second is associated with the destination membrane; and the third is present in solution.

Each peptide has either all lysine or all glutamic acid at e and g positions, meaning that one of the e/g interfaces is forced to be mismatched (see Fig. 16\n). At high pH, the system is more tolerant of an all-lysine interface, whereas at low pH, an all glutamic acid interface is preferred. The pH switch was created in the form of a competition between two peptides with the same core pattern but with e and g positions with either all lysine or all glutamic acid.

Although the two states of this switch are similar, the two studies differ in both the approach taken to design and in the details of how the two functionalities are overlaid in the peptide sequence.

The sequence was designed manually using knowledge of both structural motifs. In contrast, the Kuhlman sequence uses the CX2CX12HX3H zinc-binding motif in an alignment, which puts the second cysteine residue at a d position in the core of the coiled coil (see Fig. 17\n). This sequence was designed using the rosettadesign program,77 which in this case was used to thread target sequences onto the backbone structures for the two desired states simultaneously.

Fibers in nature tend to be nucleated; in other words, several monomers must be assembled before a stable growing fiber is formed. This gives the cell spatial and temporal control over the location of fiber growth by disfavoring the spontaneous formation of growing small oligomers in the bulk. Natural fibers are uniform in their width (and sometimes length): that is to say, all fibers formed from the same protein have approximately the same dimensions. This means that physical parameters such as flexibility, persistence length, probability of breakage, and the number of monomers per unit length are controlled. This enables the cell to produce fibers that are fit for purpose and are efficient in their use of protein. Natural fibers are dynamic: they can be switched from assembly to dissociation by changes in chemical potential. Many fibers achieve this property in an active fashion using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis as a method to manipulate the energy landscape; however, others are passively responsive to solvent conditions. Exchange of subunits can usually occur at the free ends of the fiber but can also occur along the length of the fiber. Finally, natural fibers are functional\u2014they possess binding sites on their ends and surfaces that are used to recruit other protein machinery including protein motors.",

Two of these tetramers assemble (via interactions between rod domains) to form an octomer, which can be trapped and examined under specific pH and ionic strength constraints. These octomers will further assemble to form an asymmetric 32-subunit-containing species,81 which represents the unit-length building block of the filaments.

The final assembly has been shown to contain 60 monomers in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and regular spherical particles by TEM. The particles have a diameter of around 16 nm and an internal cavity of around 6 nm. Both the internal cavity and the free ends of both the trimeric and pentameric peptides are available for functionalization.",

This was demonstrated by adding the peptide labeled with rhodamine followed by a peptide labeled with fluorescein, giving fibers with multicolored tips (see Fig. 24\n). Second, a small level of exchange along the length of the fibers was seen, potentially drawing a parallel with the intermediate filament systems.
