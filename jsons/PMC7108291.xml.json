            "text": "The triphenylmethane dye aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) has been reported to interact with a large number of protein molecules. The ATA molecule carries three carboxylic acid moieties that take negative charge at physiological pH. The structure of ATA was shown in Fig. 1\n. These charged groups are responsible for extensive ionic binding with positively charged groups on cellular proteins [1]. ATA was initially shown to inhibit template binding to QB replicase, E. coli RNA polymerase, T7 RNA polymerase and to prevent the binding of RNA to ribosome [2], [3]. It was postulated that ATA would inhibit association of the nucleic acid binding proteins with nucleic acid. Subsequently, ATA's general inhibitory effect to nucleases was reported [4]. Inhibition of apoptosis by ATA was widely documented in various cell lines under different stimulations [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Our previous study showed that aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) inhibited apoptosis induced by two different inducer gamma radiation and benzamide [an inhibitor of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase] [11]. ATA reduced significantly nuclear fragmentation and nucleosomal ladder formation without affecting upstream events like cytochrome c release or caspase-3 activation in Chinese hamster V79 treated with gamma radiation or benzamide. Further, we observed treatment with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (staurosporin and H-7) induced apoptosis (unpublished) and ATA pre-treatment reduced DNA ladder formation by PKC inhibitors without changing caspase-3 activation (unpublished). This result implicated that ATA might be interacting with down-stream events of caspase-3 in the apoptosis pathway, most likely with DNases involved in apoptosis. A large number of DNases localizing in cytoplasm are involved in apoptosis and their activity is either Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent or cation independent. For example, DNase II and l-DNase II are cation independent [12]. DNases translocate into nucleus during apoptosis and cleave DNA into nucleosomal ladder. DNase I, DNase-\u03b3, DNAS1L3, NUC70, NUC18 are all cation-dependent endonuclease and gets activated in the process of apoptosis and cleaves the DNA into large and smaller fragments [13], [14], [15], [16]. It has been reported that ATA inhibits endonucleases and promotes long-term survival of cells [6], [7].",

            "text": "In modeling studies by docking, it has been shown that ATA can bind with several viral proteins like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), S1, HIV integrase and likely to alter their functions. The same study also reported that ATA bind to the catalytic domain of RdRp in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [17], [18]. Anti-viral activity of ATA has been shown due to ATA's ability to interfere with the attachment of viral mRNA to host polyribosome complex in cell free system [17], [18], [19]. Anti-reverse transcriptase activity of ATA has been demonstrated by in vitro assay [20]. A potent inhibitor of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) is important for the discovery of therapeutic agents against retroviruses. ATA's anti-reverse transcriptase activity inspired us to investigate its role in regulation of telomerase which has telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the catalytic subunit. Telomerase is a ribonucleo-protein complex having the main catalytic subunit \u2013 TERT [21], [22], [23], associated RNA template-telomerase RNA component (TERC or TR or TER) and other associated proteins like telomerase associated protein TEP1/TP1, HSP90, P23, etc. [21], [24], [25], [26]. Besides, various other proteins have been identified that interact with the telomere. Role of these proteins and their interacting partners for maintenance of the telomere and regulation of telomerase activity is being discovered. The reverse transcriptase replicates the end of chromosomes for synthesizing the telomeric repeats with help of its own RNA molecule as the template [26]. Here we demonstrated inhibition of telomerase activity by ATA treatment in V79 cells.",

ATA can also promote bcl2 phosphorylation at evolutionary conserved residue ser-70 whose phosphorylation is required for full anti-apoptotic function [35].

To a fixed concentration of DNase I (1.33 \u03bcM) in assay buffer as used in biochemical assay of DNase I, increasing concentrations of ATA were added and subsequently tryptophan (trp) fluorescence was measured in Fluoromax3. The tryptophan fluorescence was quenched gradually with increasing concentration of ATA indicating the association of DNase I with ATA as shown in Fig. 2\n. The dissociation constant (K\nd\n = 9.019 \u03bcM) was calculated from the double-reciprocal plot as shown inset in Fig. 2. The result implicated that ATA specifically binds DNase I. We have used CD spectroscopy to elucidate whether the association of DNase I with ATA results any structural change of the DNase I or not. Here in Fig. 3\nshows the near-UV CD spectra (inset, far-UV CD spectra) of free DNase I (solid line) and DNase I with saturating ATA (44 \u03bcM) concentration (dotted line). It is known that near-UV and far-UV CD spectra correspond to tertiary structure and secondary structure of protein respectively. The CD spectrum of a protein in the near-UV spectral region (250\u2013350 nm) is contributed only by the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and disulfide bonds. So, the magnitude of the observed change in the near-UV spectra does not entirely reflect the actual changes occurring in the tertiary structure, which can be dominated by contributions from the non-aromatic residues but have no visible impact on the spectra. In our case, changes in the spectra were observed in the regions 260\u2013280 nm and 295\u2013320 nm. In addition, the CD data in the near-UV region is less noisy than in the far-UV. In light of the good signal-to-noise ratio of this data, it can be concluded that the small changes at 260\u2013280 nm and 295\u2013320 nm were not due to noise but due to the overall tertiary structure change of DNase I upon ATA binding. It is known that far-UV spectral region (190\u2013250 nm) correspond to secondary structure of protein since radiation in this wavelength region is absorbed by peptide bonds of the protein. There was a significant change in far-UV region as shown in inset (noise corrected spectrum) indicating that secondary structure of DNase I was altered upon ATA binding at 44 \u03bcM ATA. Such perturbation of three-dimensional structure of enzyme most likely was responsible for inhibition of DNase I by ATA.",

Moreover, H-7 and staurosporin, the PKC inhibitors induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and DNA ladder formation, and ATA inhibited nucleosomal ladder formation by the inhibitors without changing the caspase-3 activity (unpublished). The mechanisms by which the PARP inhibitor (benzamide), \u03b3-radiation and PKC inhibitors (H-7 and staurosporin) initiate apoptosis are likely to be different. However, the last step of apoptosis (nuclear fragmentation/nucleosomal ladder) is common to all agents. Since ATA inhibited nucleosomal ladder/nuclear fragmentation without affecting its upstream cascade like cytochrome c release or 13 activation, ATA likely modulates the DNases involved in apoptosis. In support, a large number of reports showed that ATA, a general nuclease inhibitor, inhibited DNases and apoptosis induced by different types of stimulus [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Various types of nuclease like DNase I, Dnase \u03b3, caspase activated DNase (CAD) or DNaselL3 [13], [14], [15], [16] are involved in nucleosomal ladder formation. It has been observed that restriction enzymes like Sal I, Bam H1, Pst I, Sma I are inhibited in vitro by ATA treatment [4]. Here, we observed that DNA cleaving activity of DNase I, an important member of nucleases involving apoptosis, was inhibited by ATA. DNase I also physically interacted with ATA (K\nd\n = 9.019 \u03bcM). ATA may inhibit DNase I activity after competitive binding or changing the three-dimensional conformation of DNase I. We propose that ATA might interact with other DNases involved in apoptosis and thus inhibited apoptosis.",

There was little change in the far-UV spectra of RNase A after saturating with 9 \u03bcM ATA as shown inset, indicating a slight change in secondary structure induced by ATA binding.

Telomerase activity was reduced to 76 \u00b1 6%, 54.5 \u00b1 4.5% and 39 \u00b1 4% of untreated control after treatment with 200 \u03bcM, 400 \u03bcM and 600 \u03bcM ATA, respectively, as shown by bar diagram in Fig. 7\n.

Telomerase activities after ATA treatment were significantly smaller than that of untreated control. We showed in Section 3.3 that ATA can strongly (K\nd\n = 0.255 \u03bcM) bind to the reverse transcriptase and thereby inhibited enzymatic activity of reverse transcriptase. Since telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the main catalytic subunit of telomerase holoenzyme, possibly ATA binds to TERT and inhibited telomerase activity in cells.",
