Psychological reactions to pandemics include maladaptive behaviours, emotional distress and defensive responses.1 People who are prone to psychological problems are especially vulnerable.",

During the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak (\u2018swine flu\u2019), a study of mental health patients found that children and patients with neurotic and somatoform disorders were significantly over-represented among those expressing moderate or severe concerns.3",
