            "text": "Cancer immunotherapy to boost T cell-mediated immune response in order to target and eliminate cancer cells has proven therapeutically efficacious in a variety of human malignancies1. In particular, therapeutic cancer vaccines against tumor-related epitopes that directly stimulate T cells have been clinically effective and are currently available2. Cancer cells express several antigens, including self-antigens derived from tumor tissues, as well as mutation-derived antigens (i.e., neoantigens), that can be recognized as foreign antigens by the host immune system3\u20135. Recently, cancer vaccines targeting individual neoantigens have become an attractive form of cancer therapeutics by virtue of their ability to elicit a robust T cell immune response6\u20138. Three independent clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in eliciting neoantigen-specific T cell responses in patients with late-stage melanoma9\u201311. Nevertheless, several challenges to personalized cancer treatment targeting distinct neoantigens remain as obstacles to wide clinical application of these vaccines. First, the prediction of highly immunogenic neoantigens is difficult. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology and MHC-epitope databases allow the accurate prediction of neoantigens; however, existing tools are inadequate for accurate prediction of immunogenicity due to the multiple associated factors, such as proteasomal-processing ability, intracellular routing, specific binding to highly polymorphic HLA molecules, and peptide/MHC (p/MHC)-complex stability6,12. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the predictive accuracy of MHC-binding affinity and selection of immunogenic neoantigens in order to improve currently available algorithms and bioinformatics tools13.",

Self-antigens derived from tumor-related proteins are grouped into three categories17,18: tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), and cancer/testis antigens (CTAs). TAAs are typically overexpressed in tumor tissues relative to their levels in other tissues, whereas TSAs are exclusively expressed in cancer cells, and CTAs are expressed only in germline tissues and trophoblastic cells in addition to being expressed in cancer cells. Using genetic and immunological approaches, several self-antigens have been identified as adequate targets for cancer immunotherapy16; however, vaccination against self-antigens can still potentially induce central- and peripheral-tolerance responses resulting in low therapeutic efficacy5,19 or an autoimmune response against normal tissues6. Therefore, identification of appropriate self-antigens is important for successful cancer-vaccine immunotherapy.",

Among these strategies, peptides used in cancer vaccines are 20\u201330 amino acids, showing lower antigen complexity and low costs for manufacturing21. In particular, MHC class-\u0406-restricted peptides (i.e., CTL epitopes) recognized by CD8+ CTLs play a key role in attacking cancer cells by promoting the activation and proliferation of antigen-specific CTLs22. To develop effective CTL-associated peptide vaccines, many methods use bioinformatics algorithms and proteomics approaches to identify multiple HLA-class-bound peptides23,24. Recently, proteomics approaches associated with mass spectrometry (MS)25 and specifically LC-MS/MS, were used for HLA-peptidomic analysis to directly facilitate the discovery of numerous natural peptides in complex with specific HLA molecules expressed on cell surfaces26,27. Additionally, recent advances in MS-based technologies led to the development of a robust approach to quantify the dynamics of epitope presentation28,29. However, the high numbers of HLA-restricted peptides available cannot be comprehensively tested to facilitate effective vaccine development. Therefore, we established a rapid and robust screening system combining immune-signature investigation, HLA-peptidomic analysis, and high-throughput immunogenicity testing to evaluate antigen-specific CTL responses (Fig. 1).",

Additionally, large amounts of TILs correlate with improved tumor survival30; therefore, we preselected TIL-resident TNBC tissues for histologic analysis to identify potentially promising cancer epitopes (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S1) and scored TIL density by measuring the proportion of the stromal area infiltrated by lymphocytes, as previously described31. To select highly immunogenic HLA epitopes, we analyzed the intratumoral heterogeneity of the TCR repertoires in TIL-resident cancers from six patients with TNBC (Fig. 2b,c). The TCR repertoires comprise somatic recombination of the TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, allowing the specificity of each T cell clone to be determined by rearrangement of the V, D, and J segments of the TCR\u03b2 chain during generation of the highly variable complementary determining region32,33. To evaluate TCR diversity of TILs, we assembled CDR3 sequences using the sequence reads of RNA-seq data. A unique CDR3 sequence of TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2, respectively, was defined as a clone, and the number of clonotypes represents the number of unique clones per sample after normalization with the corresponding RNA-seq depth (Fig. 2b). The T cell clonal fraction was defined as the frequency of the top 10% of TCR\u03b1 or TCR\u03b2 clones among total TCR clones (Fig. 2c). The top 10 most abundant TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 sequences in each patient are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, and expression of the three HLA-class I genes (HLA-A/B/C) is shown in Fig. 2d. We found a linear positive correlation between the number of TCR\u03b2 clonotypes and the expression of MHC-class I genes according to Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (r = 0.68) (Fig. 2e).",

In particular, the abundance of regulatory T (Treg) cells and macrophages correlated with worse outcomes, whereas the abundance of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 cells correlated with better prognosis35. Additionally, immune-specific signatures in TILs are of potential clinical significance; therefore, we estimated the distribution of TIL types in each patient according to WTS data using CIBERSORT computational analysis36 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). The relative proportion of each infiltrated immune cell was evaluated in each patient by quantifying immune composition from bulk-tissue gene-expression profiles, as enrichment of CD8/CD45RO and Th1 cells are considered positive prognostic factors37. The results indicated that CD8+ T cells were highly infiltrated in both patients TNBC#2 and TNBC#6, whereas a large proportion of Treg cells was observed in patients TNBC#5 and TNBC#6 (Fig. 3a\u2013c). Patient TNBC#6 displayed a highly enriched frequency of CD8+ T cells, as well as Treg cells, suggesting increased accumulation of TILs. Interestingly, we found a significantly increased proportion of CD8+ T cells relative to Treg cells in patient TNBC#2 as compared with that observed in other patients (Fig. 3d), suggesting the emergence of promising tumor-associated antigens. On the other hand, we found elevated levels of immune-suppressive macrophages in patients TNBC#1, TNBC#3, and TNBC#5, which is predictive of a negative outcome (Fig. 3e).",

After immunoprecipitation, high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis identified and quantified the HLA peptide sequences with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) (Supplementary Fig. S5). Notably, the number of eluted peptides from each of the six patients were substantially different (Supplementary Fig. S6), although >96% of the HLA peptides analyzed by LC-MS/MS showed typical properties associated with epitope length. As expected, most of the peptides were nine amino acids long, with only a few having 13 to 15 amino acids, suggesting a high level of consistency (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S6). Clustering of the 9-mer HLA peptides showed predominant enrichment of residues at peptide positions 2 and 9 and consistent with the anchor motifs required by the binding groove of each HLA molecule27 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. S7). Additionally, we found high numbers of CD8+ T and CD4+ Th1 cells infiltrating into the tumor sites of patient TNBC#2 and relative to Treg cells, with patient TNBC#2 showing a 4-fold higher number of CD8+ T cells as compared with that in patient TNBC#1 and accompanied by the lowest expression of MHC class I genes, suggesting a higher accumulation of antigen-specific CTLs in patient TNBC#2 (Supplementary Figs.

A total of 594 peptides were identified from the tissue of patient TNBC#2 along with elevated expression of HLA genes, whereas only five peptides were received from tissue from patient TNBC#1 and all showing the lowest expression of MHC class I genes (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. S8).

Interestingly, the high-count genes (N > 10) were significantly enriched in KEGG pathways related to cancer, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), viral carcinogenesis, and antigen processing and presentation. Numerous cancer-related genes overexpressed in cancer tissues contribute to cancer-specific or associated epitopes38, and HLA epitopes require proteasomal digestion and translocation into the ER to bind MHC class-\u0406 molecules39. It would be expected that the expression of genes encoding machinery responsible for antigen processing would be elevated under these circumstances. These results suggested that the eluted HLA peptides identified were naturally presented by HLA molecules. We further investigated the levels of the eluted peptides based on RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mRNA from the same sample (Fig. 4e,f). Compared with normal breast tissues, 174 of 594 peptides corresponding to proteins from the same sample showed elevated abundances in cancer tissues accompanied by significant differences in mRNA expression (\u22652 log2 fold change).

Currently, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)-based detection methods for monitoring ex vivo IFN\u03b3 response show low throughput relative to the number of candidate antigens being tested. Moreover, an individual antigen test requires large amounts of immune cells41. Therefore, we developed an efficient and comprehensive screening system to test CTL response based on a high-content, high-throughput imaging approach (Supplementary Fig. S9). This fluorescence-imaging-based screening system allows the use of lower numbers of viable cells up-scaled performance42,43. Development of a 384-well format capable of screening mixed populations of T cells for their response against large number of peptides enables a cost-effective approach to phenotype analysis. Notably, cancer-associated antigens are highly attractive targets for determining their efficacy in triggering a T cell response; however, numerous clinical trials targeting TAAs for vaccine development have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy due to immune self-tolerance. To identify highly immunogenic peptides incapable of eliciting self-tolerance, we tested the antigen-specific T cell response in PBMCs from a healthy donor. Monitoring ex vivo IFN\u03b3-producing PBMC reactivity using our fluorescence-labelled cell-based screening system (Fig. 5a\u2013c, Supplementary Figs. S10,S11) revealed significant IFN\u03b3 responses to two individual epitopes (eIF4A1-P and TCP1-P) in CD8+ T cells labelled with a FITC conjugated anti-human CD8 antibody (Fig. 5b). Additionally, treatment with the HLA-A*11:01-specific epitopes allowed detection of APC-conjugated IFN\u03b3 released from CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5a,b), with PMA and ionomycin co-treatment used to trigger T cell activation as a positive control. Similarly, PBMCs from two of the three healthy donors were reactive against same two epitopes (Fig. 5c).",

FACS analysis revealed that 9.99% and 7.50% of T cells were targeted by eIF4A1-P and TCP1-P, respectively, and detectable on day 12 of ex vivo T cell expansion (Fig. 5d). These findings suggested the efficacy of our method to screen highly immunogenic CTL epitopes using an imaging system on the detection of intracellular IFN\u03b3 levels following peptide stimulation. The two genes associated with the peptide epitopes, the translation initiation factor eIF4A1 and TCP1, a member of the chaperonin-containing complex TCP1-containing ring complex (TRiC), are involved in tumor proliferation and survival. eIF4A1 controls translation initiation and is a critical checkpoint protein involved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis44. Additionally, TCP1, as a TRiC member, is involved in tumor survival and growth and an oncogene driver45. Moreover, these two genes are significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues according to WTS data and data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project public proteomic database, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets. These results identified two epitopes derived from eIF4A1 and TCP1 as potential promising immunogenic antigens to boost T cell response.",

            "text": "Patients with TNBC, which is defined by the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, have a higher tendency for recurrence at ~3 years after diagnosis46,47. There are currently no known therapeutic targets for TBNC patients due to the molecular heterogeneity of the disease48. Recent accumulation of massive and comprehensive bioinformatics data allowed identification of potential therapeutic targets associated with clinical survival49. Interestingly, a TNBC subtype characterized by high levels of immune genes involved in T cell function, immune response, and antigen processing, was found to be associated with favorable prognosis, suggesting a close correlation between immune-gene signatures and better clinical outcomes50. Therefore, it is possible that TILs controlling clinical cancer progression represent key factors for preselection of tumors prior to HLA-immunopeptidomics. In this study, TIL-resident tissues were pre-selected comprehensively to investigate a diversity of TCR repertoires and immune profile as predictors of clinical outcome. We then found a positive correlation between TCR diversity, reflecting clonal composition, and the expression of MHC- class \u0406 molecules, suggesting that active tumor-antigen presentation promotes the generation of antigen-specific TILs. Additionally, immune-specific signature analysis can discriminate specific immune-cell types in each patient and thus enhance the efficiency of selective HLA-peptidomic approaches. Notably, the expressional comparison of CD8+ T cells relative to immune-suppressive Treg cells is extremely crucial to select the high antigenicity of antigens reflecting the therapeutic efficacy. Thus, the extreme increase in the number of CD8+ T cells relative to that of Treg cells in patient TNBC#2 presented a major analytical reason for further in vitro T cell response testing. Furthermore, our results indicated a positive correlation between the number of peptides identified via HLA-peptidomics and the amount of HLA molecules expressed on the surface of cancer cells. It is also possible that the observed difference in the number of eluted peptides might have been influenced by HLA-expression levels resulting from active induction of antigen presentation on MHC molecules, which subsequently elicited a strong immune response. Thus, these findings suggested that several factors should be considered for successful HLA-peptidomic approaches influenced by TCR diversity and elevated expression of HLA genes.",

T cell responses to treatment with individual peptides were monitored after 12 days of in vitro culture, as previously described11. Briefly, PBMCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, HEPES, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 10% human AB serum (Gibco), with a total of 5 \u00d7 104 PBMCs used in each well. For antigen-specific T cell expansion, individual peptides (2 \u00b5g/mL) were incubated with PBMCs in the presence of interleukin (IL)-7 (20 ng/mL; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) for 3 days. Each peptide with >95% purity was synthesized by Synpeptide (Shanghai, China). For non-specific T cell expansion, T cells were stimulated using a T cell activation/expansion kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and cells were cultured every 3 days by replacing the medium with fresh half-medium containing IL-7 (5 ng/mL) and IL-15 (5 ng/mL; Peprotech). On day 12, for ex vivo intracellular IFN\u03b3 detection, each peptide (10 \u00b5g/mL) or phytohemagglutinin (PMA) (50 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) plus ionomycin (1 \u00b5g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for the positive control was administered in the presence of Brefeldin A (1:1000; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for overnight incubation according to the ICS protocol. After intracellular fixation using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), cells were stained with antibodies against surface markers and IFN\u03b3 at 4 \u00b0C for either 1 h or overnight. For visualization of IFN\u03b3-producing T cells, a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human CD8\u03b1 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), an Alexa594-conjuated anti-human CD4 antibody (BioLegend), and an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-human IFN\u03b3 antibody (BioLegend) were specifically labeled for CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and intracellular IFN\u03b3 capture, respectively. Cells were then washed with PBS buffer, and high-throughput imaging was performed using the Operetta CLS high-content analysis system equipped with Harmony software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).",
