Their membrane biophysics and thermodynamic properties reflect to the creation of metastable phases that affect their functionality and physicochemical behavior. Thermo-and pH-responsive liposomes are innovative nanotechnological platforms for drug delivery and targeting. Polymeric micelles and polymersomes are nanostructures that are promising drug carriers, while dendrimeric structures are considered as real nanoparticulate systems that are used in drug delivery and as nonviral vectors as well as in prevention of serious infections leading to diseases.

Important categories of self-assembled nanosystems with variations regarding the biomolecule chemical structure will be presented in detail in the following pages. Liposomes were firstly described by Alec Bangham in 1965 [5] . In reality, the simple phospholipid stirring (Fig. 4. 3) in water has led to the development of a phospholipid dispersion that aimed in cell membrane study regarding its biophysical behavior. Liposomes belong to the self-assembled colloidal nanodispersion systems composed of lipidic bilayers that are able to incorporate lipophilic bioactive molecules or to entrap them into their aqueous core [5, 65] . This phospholipid dispersion was basically related to large phospholipid structures of irregular shape and micrometer size with multiple lipid layers. The lipid layers' polar heads were oriented toward the water molecules where the lipid chains have created the lipid bilayer through hydrophobic interactions. This effort was the beginning of the nanosystem development, liposomes that delivered bioactive molecules. During the past decades, liposomes are one of the most promising bioactive molecule delivery nanosystems. Liposomal technology is a developing research field, while scientific reports in this field are hundreds per year. Liposomes are closed pseudo-spherical structures that consisted of one or more lipid bilayers where inside them entrap water media and are characterized as thermodynamically unstable colloidal dispersions. Lipid bilayers consisted mainly of phospholipids and cholesterol without excluding the use of other biomaterials, e.g., polymers as liposomal structural units. Phospholipids (H 3 C) 3 amphiphilic character, in water environment orient so their polar heads are toward the water medium, while lipophilic hydrocarbon chains are protected from the water molecule connection, developing hydrophobic interactions. On liposomal surface, small molecules or macromolecules can be connected; these include antibodies that change the physicochemical properties of their surface. This fact is very important and depends upon the nanosystem functionality and its physical stability on time of production and over time.",

In the early 1960s, there was a great interest in studies related to lipid colloidal system properties that could be used as design standards of cell membrane behavior. Initially they were called bangosomes, since AD Bangham was the first one that noticed them, but later on they were called liposomes from the Greek words \u03bb\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (fat) and \u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1 (body) [5] . Bangham had suggested the term amphisomes as more appropriate since the cell membrane structural parts were amphiphilic molecules. Studying the cell membranes' dynamic properties like fluidity and lipid layers' mesophase change was a challenging field when studying biophysics and thermotropic behavior of lipid membrane and, therefore, liposomal dispersions. Lipid vesicles in their initial form (simple dispersion in water environment) had no thermodynamically organized structures and were characterized as multilamellar vesicles (MLVs).",

            "text": "In 1967 Demetrios Papahadjopoulos and coworkers [63] described the structure of sonicated microvesicles that later on were known as small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). These researches offered the biomembrane potential structure, explaining lipid layer fluidity and diffusion properties. The evolutions in this scientific field have created a fertile ground in scientific groups that started studying the possibility of applying lipid dispersions as vehicles for bioactive molecule transfer and delivery. During the past years, research related to liposomes as transport and delivery vehicles for therapeutic purposes has been developed [41] . The scientific interest in this area included the interaction of encapsulated biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, bioactive molecules) with the liposomes' structure units, their in vivo administration, the mechanisms when liposomes enter the cell, and their immunological properties. Changing the lipid composition (phospholipids and generally lipids of different structure), \u03b6-potential, liposomes' size, and size distribution were characterized as important properties that could define liposome behavior in vivo and in vitro. Phospholipids' distribution in water medium resulted in spontaneous development of lipid vesicles, and not liposomes, since liposome development needed a specific process (see Appendix). Lipidic vesicle structures (e.g., double layer, cubic structures, hexagonal structures, etc.) depend upon the phospholipid or lipid concentration that takes part in the process and their geometry that is related to their chemical structure. If the conditions mentioned before, i.e., phospholipid/lipid concentration and chemical structure, lead to lipid bilayer development, then the hydrophobic parts come in contact with water environment in a non-favorable energy way. This results to a bending so they will interact through hydrophobic interactions minimizing lipid chain exposition in water medium. The energy required for lipid bilayer bending is covered from the energy increase due to lipid bilayer's hydrophobic section exposition to the water environment. The result of hydrophobic lipid chains' bending and assemble is the development of multilayer lipid vesicles. Their description was reported for the first time in 1965 from Bangham and his coworkers [5] . So, lipid vesicles are the closed pseudo-spherical structures of one or more lipid bilayers that entrap the dispersion medium where they are. This formation offers lipid vesicles the property of being consisted of both the hydrophilic dispersion medium and the lipid chain hydrophobic section, respectively. For this reason, they can entrap hydrophobic, amphiphilic, or even hydrophilic bioactive molecules. Liposomal production with a specific process, mentioned in the Appendix -i.e., the lipid vesicle production with structural organization depended on the biomaterials' structural and geometrical characteristics, physicochemical characteristics, and their energy content -is an important fact directly related to their physical stability, the bioactive molecule entrapment ability, their release rate, and their efficacy according to their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) profile that will develop the final pharmaceutical product. During the past decades, liposomes are one of the most promising bioactive molecule carriers and delivery systems to the damaged tissues, and liposomal technology is a potential research development field while the scientific publications in this field are hundreds per year. According to the above, it can be said that liposomes are closed pseudospherical thermodynamically unstable lipid structures of dispersed lyotropic liquid crystals that are composed of one or more lipid bilayers that can bind on the inside of the water medium where they are. Lipid bilayers are composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, or other lipid molecules. Cholesterol is an important biomolecule that was chosen among the others through centuries in natural evolution process, since the system demanded thermodynamic self-sufficiency, structural stability, survival time ability, and life perpetuation through multivariate and multilevel cell organization. Cholesterol has been chosen as the most appropriate biomolecule that can sufficiently regulate the lipid bilayer fluidity that is necessary for its functions [38, 53] . Also, on liposomal surface, small molecules or macromolecules can be attached and modify their surface properties, for example, targeting antibodies through antigen connection. Nowadays, liposomes are considered as nanoparticles that develop liposomal colloidal nanosystems, extremely useful and highly promising for new pharmaceutical product development [28] .",

Liposomes have been successfully used in the field of cell physiology, and the pioneer work of Gregoriadis and coworkers in the 1970s provided evidences regarding the use of liposomes in enzyme replacement therapy [25] [26] [27] . They can be developed having a specific composition simulating cell membrane functionality, offering a model system for their study. Due to their relevant structure with the basic cell membrane components, they have been used to both stimulate and study them. These studies are on their thermotropic behavior, i.e., on the phase transitions, due to heat absorption or elimination. This thermotropic behavior can be related with the cell behavior and many assumptions can be concluded on their functionality. Also, this relation can highlight the disease factors and the biophysical changes due to mesophases resulting from phase transitions. The term disease factor can be related to the cell biophysical and thermodynamic behavior, e.g., a microbial infection can cause a cell membrane biophysical functionality change and, therefore, act as a disease factor. It is obvious that the more cell membranes and other cell organelles, even genetic material's phase transitions, affect the living functions, the more dangerous the biophysical disease factor becomes for the organs' function and for life itself. Liposomes have been used successfully for bioactive molecule action mechanism investigation, i.e., aminoglycoside antibiotics' cytotoxicity mechanism. Also, they have been used to understand the local anesthetic mode of action and as models for studying the phototoxic active oxygen-mediated incidences. Table 4 .1 presents liposomal applications in various scientific fields. It should be mentioned that liposomal applications in medicine and pharmaceutics are due to the need of new medicine development, especially new bioactive molecule delivery moieties with specific physicochemical characteristics. Liposomal properties related to their biocompatibility with cell membranes, their ability to transfer and deliver bioactive molecules and biological products, and their ability to target damaged tissues connecting with macromolecules on their surface (e.g., antibodies) are the basic reasons for health science applications.",

Molecules like weak acids are in neutral or ionic form depending on the pH of the dissolution media. A bioactive molecule like that can penetrate the liposomal bilayer. The pH inside the liposomes is regulated so the bioactive molecule can be in its ionic form and due to charged groups cannot penetrate the lipid bilayer barrier and, therefore, accumulates inside the liposomes.

It is of importance to figure out that the incorporated bioactive molecule into liposomes does not interact with the site tissue until it releases from the liposomal formulation. It is obvious that the pharmacokinetic profile of the liposomal product combines the pharmacokinetics of the liposomal delivery system as well as the pharmacokinetics of the incorporated bioactive molecule after it releases from the carrier. However, the total pharmacokinetic profile of a liposomal product still remains a scientific area to be developed, because the rate of the release affects the overall pharmacokinetics of the liposomal product [1] . Today many anticancer liposomal formulations are available in clinical practice, while a huge number are in clinical trials. The first one which received approval in 1995 was doxorubicin HCl as liposomal injection (Caelyx R in Europe and Doxil R in the United States), to treat HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and ovarian and breast cancer [75] . The published data by Allen and Stuart [1] showed that the pharmacokinetic data between the two well-known anthracyclines, i.e., doxorubicin and daunorubicin incorporated into different composition liposomal formulations with those of the free form of the two anthracyclines, showed that the clearance rates of the liposomal formulations are lower than that of the free form of the drugs. It is of importance that the sterically stabilized (surface PEG grafted) liposomal formulation that corresponds to Doxil/ Caelyx has shown a decrease clearance rate, in comparison with that of DaunoXome\u00ae which is the liposomal formulation of daunorubicin, even though the liposomal vehicles of DaunoXome have larger hydrodynamic diameter (size).",

These systems use intrinsic or extrinsic (external) stimuli as triggers in order to succeed in site-specific drug delivery and to improve the safety and efficacy of bioactive molecules. pH-, thermo-, redox-, enzyme-, magnetic field-, and light-responsive nanopreparations have been already studied extensively [13, 20] . Temperature-sensitive drug delivery systems offer great potential over their counterparts due to their versatility in design, tunability of phase transition temperatures, passive targeting ability, and in situ phase transitions [37] . Thermosensitive liposomes are developed in order to improve tumor accumulation, trigger liposomal drug bioavailability, enhance drug delivery specificity (i.e., drug painting dosing and chemodosing) and drug internalization, and personalize the treatment [77, 91] . Thermosensitive liposomal formulations minimize the toxicity of the encapsulated active substance/anticancer agent, control the release rate, and enhance the long-circulating properties by modulating the composition and the \"smartness\" \"decision making\" of the nanocarriers [44] . ThermoDox\u00ae (Celsion) is a nanoengineered drug delivery system in clinical trials (phase III) and is a low-temperature-sensitive liposomal formulation incorporating doxorubicin (anthracycline) for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma and liver cancer. ThermoDox is the first heat-activated liposomal formulation, which consisted of three synthetic low phase transition temperature phospholipids and releases the anticancer agent at 39.5\u00b0C [22] . In the past decades, there have been reported and developed many strategies for formulating pH-sensitive liposomes. The main categories based on the components and the mechanisms of triggering pH sensitivity are listed below. The first way is to combine polymorphic lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), diacetylenic phosphatidylethanolamine (DAPE), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) [74] . Secondly, the majority of these systems may contain \"cage\" lipid derivatives, such as N-citraconyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (C-DOPE) and N-Citraconyldioleoyl-phosphatidylserine (C-DOPS) [46] . The mechanism of action of pH-sensitive liposomes is presented in the literature [47, 74] . Since pH-sensitive liposomes cannot always sustain a slow and steady release, especially in a physiological pH solution, thus resulting in cytotoxicity for normal tissue, more sophisticated structures are being investigated, in order to overcome this possible instability of pHsensitive liposomes. The investigation in the area of pH-sensitive liposomal vehicles for drug delivery is still an interest approach, and because of the new intracellular targets that are recognized, the efforts in this scientific field should be expanded [15] .",

During the 1980s, various techniques connecting monoclonal antibodies on liposomal surface have been developed. The preferable strategies by which the macromolecules attached on the outer surface of the liposomal membrane are adsorption to the outer surface of liposomal vehicles, insertion into the lipid bilayers, via biotin-avidin pair, and finally covalent binding [39] . The macromolecules that they are attached on the surface of liposomes have complementary ligands on the target cells, and consequently when they arrive close to the target cell, liposome binds specifically to the target site. Bioactive molecules encapsulated in liposomes that have monoclonal antibodies on their surface include anticancer agents like doxorubicin (anthracyclines), vinca alkaloids, and taxol (taxanes) that are released in the surrounding area of the target cell, reducing the adverse drug reactions and the toxicity and improving the therapeutic effect.

After multiplication, the enriched molecules (amplicons) are determined according to their size with electrophoresis in agarose gel (they have been previously died with ethidium bromide), and their possible functional identity is certified through hybridization with specialized probe molecules. Finally, the safest procedure is to find primary structure molecules with base sequencing. Nowadays, many specialized analytical assays for substance determination are available but require special equipment, analytical labs, and trained personnel. For this reason, there is a continuous effort to find simple, fast, and low-cost methods to selectively detect the quantity of substances of interest. This determination should be available without the use of expensive equipment and from nonspecialists. The speed has great interest, especially when controlling production in industrial scale. For example, if scientists are able to detect a great concentration of an infectious factor in food, they will be able to stop production and eliminate the damages. In this case, the use of biosensors, devices that convert the biological receptor interaction with the molecule (substance) that needs determination into an analytical signal (optical, electronical, etc.).

Liposome dispersion system stability relates to its physical, chemical, and biological stability. Liposome size and size distribution measurements around the average value are important parameters to calculate the liposome dispersion physical stability. More in detail, we can mention the following: liposomes developed and dispersed in chosen water medium are in constant movement (Brown movement). The particle movement speed depends on their size, solution temperature, and viscosity. Liposome size distribution is a measure of their stability. When size distribution is stable in time, the liposome dispersion is characterized as stable and suitable for pharmaceutical use. The liposome nanosystem stability is time dependent since according to the second thermodynamic law, it is leading to collapse. In case where liposome size distribution increases with time, the liposome dispersion system is characterized as unstable and unsuitable for pharmaceutical use. With dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique (see Chap. 2), the Brown movement calculation is possible through data collected from the light scattering. Brown movement calculation will help to determine diffusion coefficient and, therefore, liposome size and size distribution around the average value. Diffusion coefficient (D) and particle size (characterized from their hydrodynamic radius, R h ) are related mathematically with Stokes-Einstein equation (see Chap. 2).",

Apart from this fact, cancer cells are not that thickly placed next to each other, like healthy cells, and the tumor's lymph system that removes substances and nanoparticles (like liposomes) from tissues and organs is insufficiently developed.

When homogeneity method is applied, the bioactive molecule is dissolved in melted lipids in temperature 5-10\u00b0C over the melting point. The method of thermal homogeneity includes the bioactive molecule dissolution and its dispersion in the melted lipids by continuous mixing in a heated surfactant solution, in the same temperature. The preemulsion that is developed is homogenized to get the nanoemulsion and then left to cool down in room temperature. The parameters that can affect the nanoparticle size and the bioactive molecule entrapment percentage are the following:",

More in specific in the field of pharmaceutics, polymersomes have the ability of incorporating a wide range of bioactive molecules and biomolecules and offer control over their release rate. Amphiphilic molecule (like phospholipids) self-assembly with various chemical structures is related to their geometrical characteristics (Thompson 2012). The geometry of these structures is defined from the proportion of hydrophobic-hydrophilic section of the amphiphilic molecule. This self-assembly amphiphilic molecule approach through geometric characterization has facilitated the understanding not only of phospholipids but of low molecular weight surfactants as well. The high molecular weight molecules like amphiphilic block copolymers, polypeptides. etc. can be designed to have the same amphiphilic character as phospholipids and surfactants but also composed of polymer chains covalently linked in series of two or more blocks. It is known that block copolymers can be organized in a great structure range, for example, in lamellar structures. Lamellar structure hydration with water solution results in a steady dispersion of amphiphile block copolymers. Proportional to the packing parameter S p (see Chap. 4), the factor F corresponds to the hydrophilic fraction and determines the morphology of copolymers formed in aqueous media. In the case of polymersomes (unilamellar polymer vesicles), F is between 25 and 40 %.",

Simulations that took place revealed that, only in small molecular weight systems, the polymorphic bilayers show a clear average level of high density that strongly reminds \"methyl through\" like the one appearing in lipid bilayers. For the high molecular weight copolymers, the two layers of the lipid bilayer are mixed or melted together in a homogenous thick shell.

BAB diblock copolymers cannot form a loop where the two hydrophobic diblocks link at the same part of the hydrophilic diblock. The membrane structure can be additionally evolved by using multiblocks that have various polymers and are subjected into phase separation after assemblage. When the proportion of hydrophobic/hydrophilic section favors the membrane development, ABC copolymers are formed into asymmetric membranes that form polymersomes whose inner and outer chemistry is different in order to minimize the surface tension and enhance the vesicle curvature ( Fig. 4.8) . Polymersomes, when making block copolymers, assemble in lyotropic phases of the liquid crystalline phase, like reverse hexagonal structures, lamellar, hexagonal perforated membranes, sponge phases, etc. Figure 4 .9 shows a detailed representation where the formed structure is presented as a proportion to the polymersome molecular weight and concentration in water. The polymersome size significantly affects the lyotropic phase development and the dispersed vesicle structures. The evolution from solid to lyotropic liquid crystal shows that small molecular weight copolymers are formed initially in reversible hexagonal structure and then in lamellar, while the high molecular weight copolymers are dissolved directly to lamellar structure. The transition from lamellar to sponge phase is not affected by the amphiphilic molecule molecular weight; instead the transition from sponginess structure to vesicles is quantitatively different and depends on the amphiphilic diblock copolymer size. Smaller copolymers form dispersed vesicles, while high molecular weight copolymers initially form vesicle gel bluster diblocks that are finally disrupted in dispersed vesicles. Amphiphilic molecules' molecular weight affects the nature of the developed vesicles. Large amphiphilic molecules form exclusively unilamellar vesicles and smaller copolymers form multilamellar vesicles. Copolymers' molecular weight does not only affect phase transition but the kinetic transition from phase to phase. One of the most important diblock copolymer clusters is their non-ergodic nature, for their formation in organized structures. This practically means that there is no structural unit exchange (polymeric chains) between micelles/vesicles and solution, underlying a critical agglomeration concentration near zero. This is a desired property for polymersomes and causes long lifetime. ",

Polymersome macromolecular nature makes them especially resistant in detergent dissolution, and therefore, the surfactant integration is proposed to be on the polymersome membrane to avoid collapse. Ruysschaert and coworkers [71] observed that this hybrid structure helps implementing phospholipids inside polymersomes, a fact that offers them advantages related to their physicochemical properties and greater effectiveness as bioactive molecule transports. Possibly, the most important example of amphiphilic molecule stabilization is the use of polymersomes for cell membrane protein scaffold. The ability of hydrophilic molecule entrapment into polymersomes is an important advantage for their transport and delivery to damaged tissues. Despite all the above, the hydrophobic or amphiphilic molecule entrapment is more or less simple; the complex kinetics when forming polymersomes prevent hydrophilic molecule entrapment. The most important parameter regarding hydrophilic molecule entrapment is the polymer membrane permeability. One of the advantages that polymersomes have is that polymer solution properties are strictly checked according to side groups' chemistry. The same polymer chain has both soluble and insoluble parts and their equilibrium defines total solubility. Therefore, polymer solubility can change from outer stimulants like temperature, pH, ionic strength, light, etc. This polymersome response to the outside environment has been used in polymer mechanics, and many devices have been developed based on polymer solubility. In polymersomes, these properties can be used for structure development that will be dissolved under specific environmental conditions. The simplest approach has been made with hydrophilic polymer connection with hydrolyzed polymers. In contact with water, polymers will be degraded by nonreversible polymersome disassembly and content release. The degradation ability after a period of time or an external stimulant is of critical importance for new carriers and for the modified polymersome diameter development. Reversible disassembly can take place when combining hydrophilic polymers with polymers presenting pH, temperature, and radiation-dependent solubility. For example, polymersomes with structural units of poly(L-glutamic acid)-poly(L-lysine) that respond to pH can be modified reversibly into weak acidic or basic water solutions. Lastly, similar transition can take place by the use of sensitive to radiation groups like poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(methylphenylsilane) (PEO-PMPS) and azobenzene-containing poly(methacrylate)-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA-PAzoMA). Recently, Mabrouk and his coworkers [48] published structures of asymmetrical polymersomes whose membrane consisted only of one lamellar copolymer sensitive to radiation: poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(4butyloxy-2-(4-(methacryloyloxy)butyloxy)-4 (4-butyloxybenzoyloxy)azobenzene (PEG-b-PMAazo444). When exposed to radiation, these polymersomes burst. This fact is attributed to thermodynamic changes related to membrane curve.",

Also chemical structure can be used offering the necessary hydrophilic/hydrophobic conditions to preserve the assembly. As mentioned before, hydrophilic blocks concentrate in brush configurations, which according to polymer nature will modify-control the polymersome surface characteristics and its interaction with the environment. As an example, it can be mentioned that block copolymers have polyethylene oxide (PEO) that assemble in polymersomes with highly hydrated and neutral polymeric brush orientation, having little protein interactions. This orientation allows PEO polymersome structural integrity in biological fluids without immune systems interactions. Their ability to escape the immune system is known as \"stealth\" and has been widely used to increase liposomes and other nanoparticles lifetime in the organism. The brush thickness and structure are critical parameters for polymersome stealth ability, as Photos and coworkers [67] have proven since they found different circulation times for different molecular weight PEO polymersomes. Polymers of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) category and other non-fouling polymers are acceptable for biological applications. It has been recently proven that polymersome surface can be additionally modified with molecules characterized as islands and have different chemistry. This is made possible by mixing various copolymers developed to produce polymersomes that separate phases of polymer-polymer. In a second level of complexity, polymersome surface can withhold macromolecular structure biomaterials like proteins, antibodies, vitamins, hydrocarbons, etc. Biotin groups' connection with hydrophilic diblocks is used to group together abidines to predefined polymersomes that will later on connect to biotinyl targeting ligand (since each abidine group has four connection spots for biotin). Using a similar approach, polymersomes with anti-ICAM-1 antibodies have been tested for inflamed endothelial cell treatment.",

In contrast with other polymers, the critical parameters in nanoscale, like size, shape, and final active groups, can be accurately controlled through their architecture, i.e., core, internal branching units, and final surface groups. These properties are not the sum of the monomer properties but are completely different and follow different rules. The term dendrimer phenomenon is used to describe these unexpected dendrimer properties. Dendrimers, as mentioned earlier, have branched units with end chemical groups that have various properties, allowing charge, hydrophilicity, or hydrophobicity alteration. Dendrimer size is extremely small, 2-10 nm, and therefore can be characterized as true nanoparticles. Their dimensions cannot be extremely large because of their branching unit stereochemistry. Branched polymers presented in the 1960s were the precursors of dendrimers since their branched units are simple branched polymers and can be characterized from their molecular 4.1 Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology weight, structure, and physicochemical characteristics according to technology evolution and analytical assays developed in the past decade. Biologically speaking, dendrimers seem to present architectural similarities with macromolecules like proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids.",

Also, the development of a liposomal nanosystem and dendrimer (PAMAM) has been tested for the entrapment of a large quantity of the anticancer agent methotrexate and doxorubicin. Two different ways of using dendrimers as bioactive molecule carriers have been described: the bioactive molecule entrapment inside the dendrimer (inside the cavities formed from the branches) through hydrophobic interactions and ionic links and the covalent bonding of the bioactive molecule on the dendrimer surface. The development of a multifunctional dendrimer consisted of PAMAM G5 generation connected with the anticancer agent methotrexate or paclitaxel, folic acid, and fluorescein as detection molecules for dendrimer course into the organism is a contribution to nanosystem development that has targeting, imaging, and therapeutic functions against cancer at the same time. It is well established that cancer cells due to their quick multiplication need large quantities of folic acid. They achieve that by increasing the folic acid receptors on their surface. So, by taking on folic acid that is connected to the dendrimer, anticancer cells receive at the same time the bioactive molecule. Lastly, the fluorescent molecule allows dendrimer tracking. The first in vitro experimental results in cancer cells that overexpress folic acid receptors are encouraging. Some of the bioactive molecules enclosed in or connected with dendrimers are indomethacin, methotrexate, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and ibuprofen.

The application of dendrimers has been studied in several fields of modern technology.

In relation to other nanotechnological systems, liposomes and polymers have been used in order to take advantage of the EPR phenomenon (see Chap. 6). This in vivo anticancer action and the simultaneous toxicity reduction of the known chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin and cisplatin when incorporated in dendrimers were attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) phenomenon. Poly(glycerol-succinic acid) dendrimers have been used to dissolve 10-hydroxycamptothecin. The system effectiveness was increased in human breast cancer series, but the bioactive molecule quick release (6 h) excluded its systemic administration. Important entrapment percentages in various dendrimer structures have been achieved for anticancer molecule etoposide, paclitaxel, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. The hydrophobic anticancer molecule entrapment in middle size dendrimers (G4-G6 generation) has been proven to increase their solubility and toxicity. The most basic disadvantage is the lack of kinetic controlled release since these systems release their content in a few hours after systemic administration. Possibly, dendrimer systems with incorporated anticancer agents can be used in the future for infusion directly to the tumor. The method of bioactive molecule covalent bonding on dendrimer surface offers advantages in comparison to their cavities. Different bioactive molecules can be connected to a dendrimer molecule and their release depends in the linkers' nature. With this method, methotrexate, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil have been covalently bonded with dendrimers of the polyamidoamine group (PAMAM). In all occasions, the results showed effectiveness sustenance, delayed release, selective accumulation on cancer cell, and lower toxicity.

The use of paramagnetic metal cations (enhancer parameters) improves the method sensitivity and accuracy. A very common enhancer parameter, the gadolinium salt diethylene triamine pentaacetatic acid (DTPA), is unfortunately diffused outside the blood vessels due to its low molecular mass. To overcome this problem, scientists studied dendrimers with gadolinium salts on their outer region. These studies showed that the modifications of dendrimer characteristics, like size and nuclear or regional composition, can lead to the development of enhancer factors that will be specialized for specific organ imaging or lymph node blood vessel imaging. Additionally, the use of dendrimers makes targeted delivery possible since the dendrimer molecular structure can be transferred to cancer tissues making dendrimers useful tools in cancer imaging. An example of dendrimer application in cancer treatment is in boron neuron capture therapy (BNCT), an experimental method of two steps. Initially, the patient is injected with a boron 10B radioactive isotope which selectively accumulates in cancer cells. Following, the patient receives radiation of a low-energy neutron neutral beam. Neutrons respond to boron inside the tumor and produce \u03b1-particles that destroy only tumor cells leaving intact the healthy cells. For this process to be effective, high concentration of 10B inside the cancer cells is needed. This can be achieved by the use of boron incorporated dendrimers and only if they can deliver it to cancer cells. ",

Lastly, nanotechnology can help in the development of multifunctional nanosystems that transfer bioactive molecules to the targeted area and nanosystems having diagnostic and therapeutic properties at the same time, allowing the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of the damaged tissue. The multifunctional nanoparticle whose development in the future will offer the possibility of many independent functions. Nanosystems that can be characterized as nanorobotics are very difficult to be developed due to their complexity of their physicochemical properties and their thermodynamic abnormalities that lead to their instability. Despite all that, modern technology moves toward that direction. Target detection can occur in organ level or even in a single surface macromolecule target that is specific for some cells like surface antigens. The most common form of identification is the identification in molecular level that is based on the fact that each organ's or tissues' special macromolecules (antigens) can be detected. To achieve that targeting macromolecules can be used, i.e., antibodies capable to interact with a target expressing a special macromolecule (antigen). Nowadays, many protocols for the development and evaluation of innovative medicines are being developed and have various approaches. In some occasions, for damaged tissue targeting, many physiological characteristics of the targeted area can be used. In basic protocols of targeted therapy that have already been used experimentally or in clinical trials, the following approaches are included: the approach of the bioactive molecule to the damaged tissue; the passive accumulation through structural and functional abnormalities of the vessels that appear in areas with tumors, heart attacks, or inflammations; the natural target that is based on the difference of a physical parameter (i.e., pH or temperature) in the target area (such as tumors or inflammation); the magnetic targeting that is connected to paramagnetic carriers, with the effect of outside magnetic fields; and the active target using molecule carrier that are specially related to the damaged tissue or the cancer cell. There are already synthetic nanoparticles (liposomes, nanocapsules, nanospheres, dendrimers, etc.) that can target and enter damaged tissue cells releasing the bioactive molecules. Nowadays nanopharmaceutics and nanomedicine lead to the development of products that offer great advantages and effectiveness. The majority of the candidate bioactive molecules present low solubility in water, preventing their effectiveness. Research has shown that when the bioactive molecules are encapsulated in nanoparticles that have the appropriate physicochemical properties especially on their surface, preventing their aggregation, a stable and effective nanosystem carrier of the bioactive molecule is developed. The nanocrystal technology that big pharmaceutical industries in the United States apply has led to the development of therapeutic products [rapamycin (Rapamune\u00ae Pfizer) and aprepitant (Emend\u00ae Merck & Co.)] that are based on this technology.",

The basic procedure reported in biological systems and nanosystems is self-assembly that controls various processes kinetically and thermodynamically. The most important biomaterial used by biomedical engineering, the scientific environment of nanobiotechnology in the field of health that combines the biological properties with the nanomaterial properties, is the genetic material, the DNA. DNA is implicated in numerous biological functions through biochemical paths while, because it is a nanomaterial, we can approach its physical properties through the science of biophysics. Recently, literature suggested that the genetic material plays an important biophysical role in physical phenomena with possible future biological applications. More in particularly, Kunming Xu [90] suggested at his work entitled Stepwise Oscillatory Circuits of DNA Molecule published in the Journal of Biological Physics, 2009 that the DNA biomolecule functions as a stepwise oscillatory circuit of electromagnetic radiation. One DNA molecule is characterized as a stepwise oscillatory circuit of electromagnetic radiation, where each base pair is a capacitor, each phospho group acts like an electric self-induction, and each desoxyribose acts as an electric switch. The circuit calculates the DNA conductance through charge rebounds between smaller and greater distances according to the experimental results that lead to many stages of mechanical rebounds. Therefore, in a charge rebound that is opposite to the phenomenon, the circuit acts according to the charge transfer mechanisms that reflect the genetic material credibility in electron transfer. The stepwise oscillatory charge transfer through DNA sequence is the one controlling the oscillatory frequency. Another approach of biophysical background concerns the electromagnetic signals that are developed from water nanostructures derived from bacterial DNA nucleotide sequences. Montagnier and his partners published a study presenting a new DNA property that is based in some bacterial sequence property to produce electromagnetic waves in high concentration water solutions. This appears to be a coordination phenomenon due to the low-frequency electromagnetic field wave that is applied. Most pathogenic organisms' DNA contains sequences that produce these signals. This phenomenon gives rise to the development of high-sensitivity detection systems for chronic bacterial infections in human and animal diseases. Most pathogenic organisms' DNA contains sequences that are able to produce these signals. This phenomenon raises new possibilities for the development of high-sensitivity tracking systems in both human and animal chronic bacterial infections. From all the examples mentioned above, the contribution of biophysics in the study of materials that structure the living organisms and are involved in numerous biochemical paths that lead to biological processes is observed. Classic physics, through its principles and laws, offers tools that can be used in understanding the behavior of these materials, not as chemical macromolecules, but as material sections with such a behavior that is based on their physical abilities like electrical conductance and electromagnetic radiation emission. Modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, has set a framework for the DNA behavior interpretation, one single nanobiomaterial that codes the genetic information.",

Table 4 .9 presents examples of vaccines that are currently in the market or in different development stages and their administration is either nasal or per os. Vaccination is one of the most valuable and cost-effective health measures to prevent and control the spread of viral/bacterial infectious diseases responsible for high mortality and morbidity as reported in Strategic Research Agenda for Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI2) \"The right prevention and treatment for the right patient at the right time\" and in the report by Vaccine Europe 2013 entitled \"Advancing health through vaccine innovation.\" A significant number of infectious diseases and chronic disorders are still not preventable by vaccination such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for which new generation vaccines are needed. Novel technologies such as adjuvants (including immune modulators and molecular targets) can enable safe and effective vaccines for difficult target populations such as newborns, elderly, and the immunocompromised. The adjuvants need to be very well designed in order to avoid excessive response, long-term autoinflammatory diseases and allergy, and secondary effects. Therefore, particulates and especially liposomes could represent a perfect vaccine adjuvant, thanks to the possibility of a high level of customization and control. More recently, liposomes have found application as vaccine-adjuvants due to their ability to prevent antigen degradation and clearance, coupled with enhancing its uptake by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and have marked liposomes as useful vehicles for the delivery of a diverse vaccine antigen. The majority of vaccines currently in development belong to the category of subunit vaccines, consisting of recombinant or purified pathogen-specific proteins or encoded (DNA) antigens that will be expressed and presented in vivo [66] . Subunit vaccines when administered alone have low efficacy in activating the immune system and require the addition of adjuvants in order to induce a measurable immune response of the antigen, through activation of the innate, and subsequently the adaptive immune system. Ideally, the adjuvant should be able to improve antigen uptake by APCs and induce an antigenspecific immune response while eliciting minimal toxicity [66] . Liposomes (Chap. 4) are a type of adjuvant that can potentially satisfy the above criteria. The adjuvant efficacy of cationic liposomes composed of Dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide and trihalose dibehenate is well established in the literature. While the mechanism behind its immunostimulatory action is not fully understood, the ability of the formulation to promote a \"depot effect\" is under consideration. The depot effect has been suggested to be primarily due to the cationic nature which results in electrostatic adsorption of the antigen and aggregation of the vehicles at the site of injection. Virosomes are liposome-based vaccine formulations that are constructed from viruses without their genetic material. However, they are not able to replicate and to cause infection. Inflexal V (Berna Biotech Ltd.) and Epaxal (Janssen-Cilag Ltd.) are biological medicines that are vaccine-based antigen liposomal delivery nanosystems against influenza and hepatitis A virus (HAV), respectively. They are composed of DOPC (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) and DOPE (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine), and their formulations are classified as suspensions. They mimic the viral infection promoting immune response while both are well tolerated and effective in children [14] . Dendrimers are under investigation as vaccine carriers and/or adjuvants for both infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy. The adjuvant capacity of mannosylated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers was documented in the literature as well as glycopeptides dendrimers and phosphorus dendrimers. Additionally, polymeric nanoparticles have been applied in vaccine delivery, showing significant adjuvant effects as they can easily be taken up by antigen-presenting cells.",

This can be achieved by using probe sonication or extrusion through specific porous polycarbonate filters. Both sonication and extrusion provide energy to the system (thermal, mechanical) that is required for breaking the MLVs' liposome bilayers in small lipid vesicles, reducing the hydrophobic part exposure to the aqueous environment. Usually, before the use of polycarbonate filters, the liposomal MLVs' mixture undergoes fusion to reduce their size. The freezethaw method includes the rapid change between cold and hot temperatures of dry ice or liquid nitrogen and the basic phospholipid transition temperature used in liposome structural units.

HMVs can be used as bioactive molecule delivery systems and for biological membrane simulation. In comparison to conventional liposome production, during this method, no volatile organic solutions are used, only glycerol that is a biocompatible and nontoxic parameter already used in pharmaceutical products preserving osmolarity during liposome production.

The branches of dendrimers can be composed of repeated structural units. The number of the repeated structural units is controlled and defines the dendrimer generation (G). Each repeated structural unit is connected to the core or to another repeated structural unit through a branching spot. The branching spot between the core and the branch is of high importance since it determines the interaction between them. The branches play an important role in the dendrimer three-dimensional configurations and in the internal microenvironment. The dendrimer outer section ends up in peripheral groups. The part of these groups is also of great importance since they define the interaction between the dendrimer and each surroundings. The number of the peripheral groups increases exponentially as the dendrimer generation increases. Dendrimer formation always includes a series of repeated reaction sequence whose completion provides each time a new generation. Dendrimers are composed of monomers through polymerization and this process includes two methods. The methods can be classified into two basic synthesis methods, the divergent method ( Fig. 4.16 ) and the convergent method (Fig. 4.17) , and there are processes that combine these two methods (Fig. 4.18) . The divergent method seems to be more effective for large-scale dendrimer synthesis, since the dendrimer weight doubles or triples in each generation. By increasing the generation number, the active group number in the surroundings increases exponentially by the necessary use of large excess of reagents. These reagents have a big difference in their molecular weight with the product and therefore are easily separated from it during reaction treatment. The exponential surrounding groups increase in each generation, increasing the possibility of incomplete reaction or by-product production. In these cases, the by-product separation is usually extremely difficult since they have similar weight and structure with the dendrimer. The convergent reagent has more advantages in relation to the divergent method. Fewer reactions per molecule are needed during coupling and activation steps, and therefore, the use of large excess of reagents is not necessary -the cleaning is usually easier and the final product structure flaws are limited. Also, the precise surrounding group setting from the very first step allows the design of more target complex courses. In an effort of developing more efficient and less time-consuming complex courses for dendrimer synthesis, many complex courses combining the convergent and divergent method have been mentioned. This way the disadvantages of both methods will be limited by preserving their advantages. In 1991, Frechet's group [32, 89] course ( Fig. 4.18 ) in which the divergent method was used for large core formation (actually it was a low-generation dendrimer) followed by the convergent method for the coupling of the core and the branches that were formed separately. Another combining approach aiming in complex course development with few steps is the orthogonal coupling method (Fig. 4.19 ) which targets in activation step removal during branching formation.",
