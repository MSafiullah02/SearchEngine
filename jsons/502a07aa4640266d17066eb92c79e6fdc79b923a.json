We did not observe a significant difference in the semi-quantitative viral load between the first tube (representing individual sample testing) and the tenth tube. The largest observed difference in Ct value was 1.73 and 2.23 for ORF-and E-gene, respectively (table 1) , which we consider not significant. To evaluate the test in patients with a moderate likeliness of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 50 samples routinely sent in for SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients with clinical symptoms were randomly assigned to ten five-sample mini-pools.

We detected no significant difference in the amount of virus detectable by NAT in the single sample and minipool tube. Therefore, by applying this protocol in the diagnostic process, no loss of diagnostic or analytical sensitivity would be expected, dismissing a main concern that might hinder implementation. We presume that our mini pooling process can be implemented for all NAT methods and all dry swaps. We applied the protocol in two routine scenarios, where the novel protocol was able to reduce to total number of required NAT tests by up to 40%, without loss of diagnostic sensitivity.",

This could be especially useful when screening professional groups that are exposed to the virus while also posing a risk of spreading it, such as health care workers and emergency responders, or groups at risk, such as the elderly. This approach would not be efficient in a setting with high pre-test probability, where it would be likely that the individual samples would have to be retested. Here, a single sample test, or a smaller pool size would be advisable.",

Samples from a round robin test provider (INSTAND, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) with predetermined concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 were used. Four of the samples were incubated in a solution containing SARS-CoV-2, one was incubated in solution not containing virus. Each of the swabs was transferred to a five-sample mini-pool, in accordance with the protocol described above. Respiratory swabs from SARS-CoV-2 negative volunteers were used to complete the pools. Results of single sample and mini-pool testing were compared. We determined that all mini-pools containing a SARS-CoV-2 positive sample were correctly identified in the minipool protocol, independent of the virus concentration in the original sample. The mini-pool containing no SARS-CoV-2 positive sample was also true negative. When comparing the Ct values in the single sample and the mini-pool (table 2), the largest observed gap between Ct values was 0.87 (sample 4, in the E gene as well as ORF-region), which we consider not significant.",
