All children 25 months of age and younger who participated in a previous case\u2010control study on risk factors for acute wheezing among children 0.5\u201312 yr of age (18) were invited to participate in the present study. Criteria for inclusion in the case\u2010control study have been previously described. Briefly, patients were selected if they presented wheezing that required therapy with inhaled \u03b22\u2010agonists as judged by the attending physician. In the previous case\u2010control study, children with chronic respiratory illnesses (n = 2) (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and those who reported therapy with corticosteroids within 4 wk prior to the ED visit (n = 8), were not included (18). During the time period of selection of patients, 3497 children 25\u2010month old or younger had been admitted to ED from both Hospitals. Of those, 126 were admitted for acute wheezing and 84 were residents in the city of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto. Parents and/or caregivers of eighty of these children (95%) have agreed to participate in the study.",

A positive history of allergy in the child was defined as a report of physician\u2010diagnosed asthma, rhinitis, and/or atopic dermatitis (AR). A positive parental history for allergy was characterized by the report of asthma, rhinitis, and/or AR diagnosed by a physician in the mother and/or father. Current and retrospective information was obtained for some environmental factors including breast\u2010feeding, pre\u2010 and post\u2010natal exposure to tobacco smoke. Data on peripheral blood eosinophil counts; serum levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE antibodies to mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Blomia tropicalis), cockroach (Blattella germanica), cat, dog, and foods (cow's milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, and fish); detection of viruses in nasal washes and allergen levels in the homes were available from the initial study (18). Briefly, total and specific IgE were measured using the UniCAP system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Specific IgE levels \u22650.7 kU/l (CAP score \u22652) were considered positive. Nasal washings were collected and processed for detection of respiratory viruses as previously described (6). Respiratory syncytial virus antigen was detected using both a rapid enzyme immunoassay (Test\u2010Pack, Abbott) and indirect immunofluorescence (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Human rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA were detected by RT\u2010PCR, influenza, and parainfluenza viruses were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Adenovirus was detected by culture; cytopathic effect was confirmed by immunofluorescence, and typing was carried out by PCR. Dust samples were collected from four sites in each patient's home: bedding, bedroom floor, TV room and kitchen, within 3 wk of the ED visit. Measurements of major allergens from mites (Groups 1 and 2), cockroach (Bla g 1), cat (Fel d 1), and dog (Can f 1) in house dust extracts were carried out using monoclonal antibody\u2010based enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Indoor Biotechnologies Inc., Charlottesville, VA, USA). High\u2010level exposure to mites and cockroach was defined as Group 1 mite allergen levels \u22652 \u03bcg/g of dust in bedding, and cockroach allergen Bla g 1 \u22652 U/g of dust in the kitchen, respectively; high\u2010level exposure to cat and dog was characterized as at least one dust sample in the house containing concentrations of Fel d 1 \u22658 \u03bcg/g and Can f 1 \u226510 \u03bcg/g, respectively.",

The median ages of the children at T2 and T3 were 18\u2010 and 32\u2010month old, respectively. At T2, a questionnaire was used to record presence of wheezing, nasal symptoms, and skin disorders. At T3, patients were evaluated by clinical history and physical exam, and blood samples were collected for eosinophil quantitation and measurement of serum levels of total IgE and specific IgE to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog. All children underwent skin prick testing with extracts of D. pteronyssinus, D farinae, cat hair, dog dander, B. germanica, Periplaneta americana, and foods (cow's milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, and fish) (Bayer, Spokane, USA) and B. tropicalis extract (2 mg/ml, kindly provided by Dr Enrique Fernandez\u2010Caldas, CBF Leti, Spain). Skin prick tests (SPT) were carried out on the back or forearm, using a prick lancetter (Bayer, Spokane, USA). A reaction was considered positive when a wheal with a mean diameter of at least 3 mm, or at least 3 mm greater than the negative saline control, developed within 15 min after application of the extract. Presence of erythema was also an essential criterion for a positive reaction. Positive (10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride, Bayer) and negative (sterile albumin\u2010saline with phenol, Bayer) controls were used in all tests.",

It is thought that IgE\u2010mediated inflammation found in most children with persistent symptoms of asthma is a key factor in causing lung function impairment and airway remodeling. However, identification of children at risk for development of persistent symptoms remains a challenge. A stringent clinical index has been defined for children with persistent wheezing during the first 3 yr of life that predicted subsequent asthma. This asthma predictive index included either a parental history of asthma, the presence of allergic eczema in the child, or two of three \u2018minor\u2019 criteria (eosinophilia, wheezing without colds, and allergic rhinitis) (19).",

            "text": "Although genetic factors have been shown to play a role in both allergic sensitization and asthma, evidence suggests that events taking place between 2 and 3 yr of age might be crucial determinants for the development of asthma. Treating children at this age with inhaled corticosteroids may alter the course of the disease and prevent loss of lung function, and this possibility is currently under investigation (20). Previously, results of the Childhood Asthma Management Program study (CAMP study) have failed to demonstrate an effect of prolonged treatment of 5\u201312\u2010year\u2010old children with asthma with low\u2010to\u2010moderate doses of inhaled budesonide in preventing decrease in lung function (21), however, in that study it is possible that treatment may have started too late. Alternative strategies have focused on manipulating the environment of high\u2010risk individuals as an attempt to reduce the prevalence of asthma in children. At present, six primary prevention controlled studies are in progress (22). The longest follow\u2010up reported has been from the Isle of Wight study. Stringent allergen avoidance measures instituted at birth, aimed at reducing exposure to HDM and preventing food sensitization, resulted in a significant decrease in asthma symptoms and sensitization to allergens at age 8. Likewise, outcomes of the Canadian Primary Prevention Study on high\u2010risk infants have been reported at age 2 yr, showing that intervention comprising avoidance of mite, pet allergens and environmental tobacco smoke, as well as dietary regimen resulted in reduction of asthma in the intervention group (23). In the present study, children were sensitized primarily to HDM and cockroach and this is in keeping with previous studies carried out in our area, evaluating children 2 yr and older with acute wheezing or those attending allergy specialty clinics (18, 24). A strong relationship between exposure and sensitization has been demonstrated for mites and cockroach (25, 26). Our results suggest that the high rates of sensitization to these allergens may be due to the fact that 74% and 37.5% of children in the present study were exposed to high levels of mite and cockroach allergens in their homes, respectively, similarly to other reports from Brazil (27, 28). Previous studies in our area have shown that daycare centers and schools are sources of significant exposure to mite and cockroach allergens (29), which might also contribute to sensitization.",

This observation is in keeping with previously reported data from children living in the metropolitan region of Boston (30) and also in a multi\u2010ethnic sample of low\u2010income infants younger than 2 living in Denver (31). The mechanisms by which cockroach allergens may cause airway inflammation are not fully understood. In the case of mites, it has been demonstrated that several mite allergens (Group 1, Der p 3, Der p 6, Der p 9) are biologically active proteolytic enzymes, and it is thought that this enzymatic activity may contribute to allergenicity (32). On the other hand, no cockroach allergens with enzymatic activity have been identified (33, 34). It is possible that high levels of cockroach allergen in the home function as surrogate marker for other environmental factors. In our study, the majority of children belonged to low\u2010income families and factors such as endotoxin exposure, not analyzed in the present study, could account for the observed association of exposure to cockroach with persistent wheezing.",

A meta\u2010analysis revealed that children who were breast\u2010fed for at least 3 months had a 20% decrease in the risk of asthma (14). In contrast, data from a general population cohort showed an increased risk for asthma associated with breastfeeding for 4 wk or more (15). Likewise, data from the Tucson cohort suggested that breast\u2010feeding might lead to higher prevalence of asthma in allergic children by the age of 6 yr (35). It is possible that this result may reflect a reverse effect due to the fact that families with an allergic predisposition may have been advised to breast fed their children for a longer time. We have found that exclusive breast\u2010feeding during the first month of life was an independent protective factor against the persistence of wheezing at 2\u20134 yr of age. Reassessment of these children as they reach school age will show whether this protective influence is still present at that time.",

However, monitoring viral infections prospectively would have been a more appropriate way to assess the role of respiratory viruses in development of asthma. The small number of patients in our cohort may have caused the estimates of incident asthma and risk factors, including respiratory viral infections, to be underpowered. Classification of children as persistent wheezers in the present study was based on criteria described in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (2). Although our evaluation has been carried out at an earlier age as compared to the Tucson study, results of this long\u2010term prospective investigation (2) have revealed that children who presented frequent wheezing in their first 3 yr of life were more likely to develop persistent symptoms throughout childhood and to have lower pulmonary function by ages 6 and 13, as compared to those who had not wheezed in the first 3 yr of life.",
