It was first discovered in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002, and spread to 26 countries with 8098 cases, including 774 deaths, over 8 months until 5 July 2003, when the World Health Organization reported that the last human chain of transmission in that epidemic had been broken 1. SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) is the etiological agent of this disease. The 3C\u2010like protease (3CLpro, also referred to as the main protease, Mpro) of the virus is a key enzyme, as it cleaves several sites to produce non\u2010structural proteins that are essential for genome replication and virion production, such as an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, a helicase, ribonucleases and 3CLpro itself, from two types of polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) 2.",

However, these proteases exist within the polyproteins, and are excised by their own proteolytic activity (\u2018autoprocessing\u2019). These proteases often function as homo\u2010dimers. SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro exists as a homo\u2010dimer, in which each protomer has an active site 3. Precise processing of its N\u2010terminus is important for its proteolytic activity 4, 5, 6. Indeed, expression of enzymes with two to five additional vector\u2010derived amino acid residues or without the first amino acid residue displayed reduced activity (1\u201340%) 5, 6. This is because the processed N\u2010terminus of one protomer is required for formation of the oxyanion hole in the active site of the other protomer in the homo\u2010dimer 3. Although the mature protease cleaves both the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminus of the 3CLpro precursor from the replicase polyproteins, it is not clear how the first 3CLpro molecule is excised and becomes mature after SARS\u2010CoV infection of human cells.",

We developed a new method to investigate autoprocessing of SARS\u2010CoV 3CL protease, which completely eliminated these problems. In this paper, we describe the activities, measured under the same conditions, of the mature form and pro\u2010forms with the N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence, C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence and both pro\u2010sequences toward the pro\u2010form with both N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequences. Furthermore, by use of two types of substrates, we determined that the first N\u2010terminal processing from the polyprotein occurs in a trans manner, i.e. the pro\u2010form dimer cleaves the monomeric form of the pro\u2010form, and determined the inhibitory modes of the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequences, i.e., the N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence has a cis (intra\u2010dimer and inter\u2010protomer) effect, and the C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence has a trans (inter\u2010dimer) effect.",

The S tag is a 15 amino acid residue peptide tag derived from nuclease S, which can be detected by the S protein, derived from the other part of nuclease S. Although, stretches of more than several hundred amino acid residues are associated with the 3CLpro region on both sides of the polyprotein in infected cells, we assumed that the effects of elements upstream and downstream of the 10 amino acid regions tested are minimal.",

The 34 kDa band of the catalytically active construct (WT) in Fig. 1B was stained using an antibody against SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro, but not by those against either the His or S tag. This mature form was excised from the gel, and its N\u2010terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be SGFRKMAFP. Its molecular mass was determined by MALDI\u2010TOF mass spectrometry as 33 792 Da, which agreed well with its calculated molecular mass (33 845 Da). However, the catalytically inactive form (C145A), in which the active residue Cys145 was converted to Ala, was unable to process either the N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence or the C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence, and resulted in the 41 kDa band in Fig. 1B (calculated molecular mass 40 525 Da), which reacted with antibodies against the His and S tags (Fig. 1C).

This substrate comprises the S tag, the N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence of 10 amino acid residues, the N\u2010terminal sequence of 10 amino acid residues, GFP, the C\u2010terminal sequence of 10 amino acid residues, the C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence of 10 amino acid residues, and the 6xHis tag. The substrate molecule (GFP substrate) and the enzyme molecule (3CLpro, mature or pro\u2010form) were each synthesized using the E. coli cell\u2010free protein synthesis system at 30 \u00b0C for 4 h, as described above. The protein solutions were then mixed together and incubated for 1 h at 30 \u00b0C. The mature and pro\u2010enzymes (Q\u20131N, Q306N and Q\u20131N/Q306N) cleaved the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal processing sites in the substrate molecule, and thus we were able to estimate the activities of the pro\u2010enzymes toward these processing sites. The enzyme solution synthesized by the cell\u2010free protein synthesis reaction was serially diluted (2\u2010, 4\u2010, 8\u2010, 16\u2010, 32\u2010fold, etc), mixed with the substrate molecule (1 : 1), and incubated for 1 h (Fig. 2B). We estimated the activity of the enzyme (or pro\u2010enzyme) toward the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal processing sites in the GFP substrate on the basis of the dilution ratio at which 50% cleavage was achieved (Fig. 2C).",

The substrate (41.8 \u03bcm) was diluted 1\u2010, 2\u2010 or 4\u2010fold, and was mixed with 256\u2010fold diluted mature 3CLpro enzyme solution (0.088 \u03bcm) (1 : 1).

Although the K\nM value could not be estimated, because it is much larger than the concentrations of the substrates used, the k\ncat/K\nM per protomer was estimated as 6800 m\n\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 from the Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot (Fig. 2D). Strictly speaking, kinetic parameters must be measured under conditions where the employed substrate concentration is comparable to the K\nM value. However, in this case, the substrate concentrations were quite low compared to the K\nM value. Therefore, the k\ncat/K\nM value obtained is not precise, but may be used as an apparent value. The mature form of SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro exists as a homo\u2010dimer, and the k\ncat/K\nM value of the dimer is 13 600 m\n\u22121\u00b7s\u22121. Considering the differences in the substrates, this value is comparable to that reported by Xue et al. 5 (26 500 m\n\u22121\u00b7s\u22121). They used a synthetic peptide as a substrate, whereas we used proteins synthesized by the cell\u2010free translation system.

            "text": "The activities of the enzyme and its pro\u2010forms were estimated on the basis of the dilution ratios at which 50% cleavage of the substrates was achieved at 30 \u00b0C and 1 h (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, the velocities of the cleavage reactions were the same, and thus the dilution ratios are proportional to the velocities of the cleavage reactions catalyzed by a certain amount of the enzyme. In turn, they are proportional to the V\nmax/K\nM values, because the K\nM is much higher than the concentration of the substrate used (Fig. 2C). These V\nmax/K\nM values may be converted to k\ncat/K\nM values using the concentrations of the enzyme species estimated by the SDS/PAGE analyses described above, and the activities are indicated by their k\ncat/K\nM values in Table 1 and Fig. 4. All molecules had processing activities towards both the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal processing sites of the GFP substrate (Fig. 4): the pro\u2010form with the N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence (Q\u20131N) had approximately 19% activity, the pro\u2010form with the C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence (Q306N) had approximately 33% activity, and the pro\u2010form with both pro\u2010sequences had approximately 4% activity as compared to the mature form (WT). The cleavability of the C\u2010terminal processing site (VTFQ\u2193GKF) of the GFP substrate was approximately half of that of the N\u2010terminal processing site (AVLQ\u2193SGF) (0.56 by the mature enzyme, 0.60 by Q\u20131N, 0.50 by Q306N, and 0.49 by Q\u20131N/Q306N). These values are in good agreement with that obtained in a previous study of the mature enzyme (0.41) toward synthetic peptides 10. These values also explain the order of cleavage of the two processing sites in the catalytically inactive pro\u20103CLpro mutant (C145A) with the mature enzyme 9: first at the N\u2010terminal site, and then at the C\u2010terminal site. The values may also be explained by the difference at the P2 position (Leu for the N\u2010terminal site, Phe for the C\u2010terminal site), according to recent detailed analyses by Chuck et al. 11. They estimated the substrate specificity by mutating each of the residues, one by one, at the P5\u2013P3\u2032 positions of the N\u2010terminal processing site. Therefore, there is no difference in accessibility between the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal processing sites in the GFP substrate.",

However, as shown in Fig. 1, the pro\u2010forms of 3CLpro synthesized by the E. coli cell\u2010free protein synthesis system had sufficient proteolytic activity to process their own autoprocessing sites. Moreover, they were able to process a substrate in which the core region was replaced with the GFP protein. Although SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro forms a homo\u2010dimer 3, this GFP\u2010replaced substrate molecule does not dimerize with 3CLpro. Therefore, these pro\u2010forms efficiently process the autoprocessing sites in a trans manner on the GFP substrate (Figs 2, 3B, and 4). These pro\u2010forms also efficiently processed the autoprocessing sites on the pro\u2010form of a catalytically inactive 3CLpro(C145A) mutant [pro\u20103CL(C145A)] (Figs 3C and 4). The fact that 3CLpro species with the N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence (Q\u20131N and Q\u20131N/Q306N) cleaved the autoprocessing site of 3CLpro(C145A) as efficiently as the GFP\u2010replaced substrate suggests an autoprocessing mechanism in which the pro\u20103CLpro dimer (enzyme) cleaves the site in the monomeric form of the pro\u2010form (trans reaction). Although an X\u2010ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the N\u2010terminus of the mature form in the dimeric structure of 3CLpro is buried inside the molecule 3, this protease exists in equilibrium between the dimer and monomer in solution 7, 12. The pro\u2010sequences enhance dissociation of the dimer 7, 12, and both the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminus of the monomer molecule are exposed 13, 14, 15. Therefore, it is plausible that the pro\u2010form also exists in a dimer and monomer equilibrium, and that the dimer molecule easily processes the monomer molecule.",

However, there are some differences in the processability of the substrate molecules. We used two substrates: pro\u20103CL(C145A), the model substrate of the pro\u2010form, and the GFP substrate, in which the core region is replaced by the GFP protein (Fig. 2A). The difference between these two substrates is the ability to dimerize with the enzyme protomer (the mature and pro\u2010forms of 3CLpro). The GFP substrate acts only as a substrate, whereas pro\u20103CL(C145A) acts as both substrate and protomer in a dimer. As each protomer of the SARS 3CLpro dimer has an active site, the concentration of the active site in the reaction solution does not change when using the pro\u20103CL(C145A) substrate, even if the active protomer dimerized with the pro\u20103CL(C145A) substrate. Therefore, the difference in reactivity between the GFP substrate and the pro\u20103CL(C145A) substrate reflects the influence of the N\u2010 or C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence of 3CLpro(C145A) on the active site of the catalytically active protomer with which it dimerizes.",

One is that the C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence of the protomer reduces its own activity (\u2018intra\u2010protomer\u2019). The other is that the C\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence inhibits another enzyme dimer, e.g. through competitive inhibition (\u2018inter\u2010dimer\u2019).

This is consistent with the higher cleavability of the N\u2010terminal processing site than the C\u2010terminal processing site, as reported by Fan et al. 10 and found in the present study. They proposed a mechanism for autoprocessing of polyproteins in which the first mature 3CLpro molecule is formed: first, cleavage of the N\u2010terminal processing site occurs, the dimeric structure forms as the mature 3CLpro, and C\u2010terminal processing then occurs in an inter\u2010molecular manner 7. They also solved the crystal structure of an inactive mutant (C145A) of the mature form of 3CLpro, in which the C\u2010terminal moiety of a protomer in the dimer was bound to the active site of a protomer in the adjacent asymmetric unit, and proposed that this structure represented that just after C\u2010terminal processing had occurred 7.",

            "text": "Thus, the most important step in the maturation process of 3CLpro appears to be N\u2010terminal autoprocessing of the 3CLpro moiety in the polyprotein 7, 12. As protomer dimerization had been assumed to be essential for the proteolytic activity of 3CLpro, Hsu et al. 7 proposed that the 3CLpro moiety of the polyprotein dimerized in a different manner to dimerization of the mature form, in which the N\u2010terminal processing site of a protomer was cleaved by the active site of the other protomer (cis cleavage). After cleavage of both N\u2010termini of the protomers, rearrangement of the protomers occurs to form the same dimeric structure as that of the mature enzyme. Subsequently, cleavage of the C\u2010terminal processing site of the other molecule of the N\u2010terminally processed dimer, as well as cleavage of the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal processing sites in other polyprotein molecules, occurs. However, the possibility of a first cis cleavage of the N\u2010terminus of the polyprotein dimer is based only on the fact that the N\u2010terminus of a protomer is near the active site of the other protomer in the crystal structure of the mature enzyme 3. This possibility was supported by Chen et al. 16, who demonstrated that mutants of the 3CLpro pro\u2010form that exist in the monomeric form, as determined by a gel\u2010filtration assay, had N\u2010terminal processing activities. In contrast, Li et al. 12 proposed a trans mechanism for the first N\u2010terminal processing of the polyprotein, in which the 3CLpro moiety forms the dimeric structure of the mature form, and cleaves the N\u2010terminus of another polyprotein molecule. They used two types of pro\u20103CLpro molecules with an N\u2010terminal pro\u2010sequence of six amino acids, accompanied by CFP and YFP at the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini, respectively: one contains an active (wild\u2010type) protease site and and inactive N\u2010terminal processing site (Q\u20131E) (enzyme), and the other contains an inactive protease site (C145A) and an active (wild\u2010type) N\u2010terminal processing site (substrate). They demonstrated cleavage of the processing site in the substrate molecule (C145A). However, this approach did not eliminate the cis reaction by which the enzyme molecule and the substrate molecule dimerize. Although our results also did not completely eliminate the possibility of the cis reaction, they indicated that the trans reaction is sufficiently robust for the autoprocessing, and is the main path for the first N\u2010terminal processing of the 3CLpro moiety in the polyprotein.",

            "text": "SARS\u2010CoV contains RNA(+) as its genome in the virion particle 8. After infection of cells, this RNA(+) is introduced into the cytosol and translated to form two large polyproteins, pp1a (4382 amino acids) and pp1ab (7073 amino acids), the latter of which is produced by a \u22121 translational frameshift occurring just upstream of the stop codon of pp1a. These polyproteins are processed by PL2pro and 3CLpro to form proteins nsp1\u2013nsp11 from pp1a, and proteins nsp1\u2013nsp10 and nsp12\u2013nsp16 from pp1ab (nsp5 is 3CLpro). These proteins form a multi\u2010subunit protein complex called the \u2018viral replicase complex\u2019, which generates a nested set of viral sub\u2010genomic segments by complicated reactions 8. Only three cleavages (between nsp1 and nsp2, nsp2 and nsp3, and nsp3 and nsp4) are performed by PL2pro, and the other 11 sites are cleaved by 3CLpro. However, the cleavages by PL2pro are suggested to occur before those by 3CLpro\n17, and proteolysis between nsp3 and nsp4 by PL2pro may occur before 3CLpro activation. At this stage, 3CLpro (nsp5) is located between nsp4 and nsp6. Both nsp4 and nsp6 are membrane proteins. Oostra et al. reported that the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini of both the nsp4 and nsp6 proteins are on the cytoplasmic side of the ER 17, 18, so the 3CLpro moiety is on the cytoplasmic side. Moreover, they proposed the membrane topology for polyprotein pp1a, in which all of the cleavage sites cleaved by 3CLpro, including its own N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal processing, are on the cytoplasmic side, and are accessible by mature 3CLpro and the 3CLpro moiety in the polyprotein 18.",
