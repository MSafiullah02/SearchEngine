From their reports, a patient with mild flu-like symptoms underwent transphenoidal pituitary surgery in early January 2020, before the severity of this pandemic was well established. Multiple members (>14 by report) of the patient care team, both within and outside of the operating room, became infected from what became recognized as human-to-human transmission of COVID-19.2 Testing for COVID-19 prior to that time was scarce. A second case of intraoperative transmission of COVID-19 occurred later on January 2020, at the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan province. A young patient with a known pituitary adenoma developed fever and acute vision changes and was diagnosed with pituitary apoplexy and suspected viral pneumonia based on imaging studies. The surgical team was aware of the potential risks of infection, but given the acuity of symptoms proceeded with transphenoidal surgery using personal protective equipment (PPE). The neurosurgeon and 2 operating room (OR) nurses employed N95 masks and the anesthesiologist reportedly used a \u201chome-made\u201d positive pressure helmet. The operation was completed successfully without incident and the surgical team was quarantined after surgery. Within 3 to 4 d, all of them developed fever and respiratory symptoms compatible with pneumonia, except the anesthesiologist. Fortunately, all recovered with no sequelae. The patient, however, required prolonged intubation, but finally recovered.",

They are testing only people who have been admitted to the hospital, so those 20 at home are not confirmed, but have classic symptoms. A previously healthy 60-yr old facial plastic surgeon died from COVID-19 3 d ago. A young, otherwise healthy otolaryngology chief resident had a short prodrome, rapidly decompensated and died from what was found to be acute myocarditis and cardiac arrest.

Due to this apparent high risk with endoscopic transnasal surgery on COVID-19 symptomatic patients, despite current limitations in testing capacity, our institution has approved testing for COVID-19 in preoperative patients needing this type of procedure urgently or emergently. This is true even for asymptomatic patients (ie, no cough and/or fever), although the true risk in this cohort of patients is still unknown. If the test is negative and the patient is asymptomatic, we may proceed using normal levels of protective gear; however, the rate of false negative tests is still to be determined, and until this is known, the use of additional levels of PPE, such as N95 and face shields can be considered. If the test is positive, we defer surgery if at all possible until the infection is cleared, verified by repeat testing. When endonasal surgery cannot be postponed in a COVID-19 positive patient, based on guidelines now being used in China, we have recommended to our institutional officials that we utilize full powered air purifying respirator (an enclosed powered system with high efficiency particulate air filter), acknowledging that they have challenging decisions surrounding allocation of limited resources that are urgently needed by our critical care teams taking care COVID-19 patients.9 Alternatively, a transcranial approach should be considered whenever possible. Because endonasal surgery creates clouds of droplets and aerosols which may permeate the operating environment, anyone in the operating theater requires the same protection when operating on known COVID-19 positives.10-12",

The test that we are using, developed at Stanford, is an in-house assay that uses a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This first screens for the presence of virus envelope protein, and if positive then evaluates for the presence of the ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase gene for confirmation (Developed by Benjamin Pinsky MD, Stanford University). Positive results from this test have been demonstrated to be very sensitive and very specific and have been given early approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The Chinese center for disease control test uses different gene targets and primers and thus may, or may not, have a different accuracy profile.",
