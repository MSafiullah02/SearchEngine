            "text": "Transfer of passive immunity to calves must occur by ingestion of colostrum because sufficient Ig are not passed across the placenta to calves in utero as indicated by practically no Ig present in serum at birth (Franklin et al., 1998). Furthermore, calves have a relatively naive immune system at birth that inhibits their ability to mount an effective immune response as evidenced by the gradual decline of Ig from 24 h after the first feeding of colostrum through approximately 3 wk of age, and the increase in numbers and percentages of B-cells through 6 wk of age (Nagahata et al., 1991; Franklin et al., 1998). The method used to supply colostrum to a calf can have a major impact on absorption of Ig and, thus, the health, performance, and survival of the calf (Besser et al., 1991). Without question, the successful transfer of passive immunity is an extremely important component for minimizing death losses of calves (Wells et al., 1996). In the United States, the most recent national data indicate that approximately 55% of calves are allowed to remain with the dam and nurse, while 45% are removed prior to nursing (NAHMS, 1996). Of those remaining with the dam, 29.4% of the calves received their first colostrum by nursing the dam, which leaves approximately 25% of calves receiving first colostrum by a combination of nursing and hand-feeding.",

Resultsof these studies are inclusive. Nocek et al. (1984) reported that Holstein calves fed a total of 5.45 L of colostrum in three feedings by bottle during the first 12 h after birth had higher serum protein and serum IgG concentrations than calves that remained with their dams for 24 h and were allowed to suckle. In contrast, Quigley et al. (1995) reported that Jersey calves that suckled had higher serum IgG concentrations compared with calves fed 2 L of colostrum by bottle in the first 12 h. Stott et al. (1979b) reported greater Ig absorption by Holstein calves allowed to suckle their dam over a 24-h period compared with calves fed by bottle; however, the greatest amount fed by bottle was only 4 L during the first 12 h after birth. The results of these studies may be related, at least in part, to the amount of colostrum fed by bottle rather than differences caused by suckling versus bottle-feeding.",

Growth of rumen papillae aids in allowing the calf to change from a monogastric form of digestion to one characteristic of adult ruminants (Warner, 1991). When calves consume both calf starter and water at an early age, maturation of the rumen occurs at an earlier age compared with milk-feeding alone. This progress toward maturation of the rumen allows calves to be weaned effectively as early as 4 wk (Anderson et al., 1987).",

Based on common on-farm procedures, the S calves were helped to suckle one time or were given a small amount of colostrum (approximately 0.5 L), hand-milked from the dam, by bottle to stimulate suckling if they were observed to be slow to stand. Calves in the B group were removed from their dams before suckling, fed 2.84 L of colostrum by bottle, placed in individual calf hutches, and fed another 1.89 L of colostrum by bottle 12 h after the first feeding. Fresh colostrum from the dam was used for B calves if it measured greater than 60 mg of Ig/ml of colostrum using a colostrometer. Otherwise, high-quality (>60 mg of Ig/ml) frozen colostrum was warmed to at least 26\u00b0C and fed. The first feeding for B calves averaged less than 3 h after birth.

The calf was included in data relating to health parameters such as fecal scores, electrolyte treatments, serum protein concentrations, and serum IgM and IgG concentrations that would be directly related to method of feeding colostrum. Of the 15 B calves, only three calves required the use of an esophageal feeder to supply part of the first allotment of colostrum. An esophageal feeder was only used if calves refused more than 0.24 L of colostrum after multiple attempts to feed the calf by nipple-bottle.",

For the dams of the B calves, seven were first lactation and eight were second or greater lactation, with average colostrum quality of 87 and 89 mg/ml, respectively. Six dams of B calves either were first lactation animals that were difficult to milk, did not produce enough colostrum, or colostrum quality was low which required the use of frozen colostrum to provide calves with 2.84 L at birth and 2 L at 12 h after birth. Similar problems with low volume or low quality colostrum for dams of calves that are allowed to suckle naturally would place those calves at risk for failure of passive transfer of immunity.",

One explanation for this difference might be that calves left with their dams became accustomed to eating at frequent intervals compared to B calves, which were fed milk twice daily. If calves became accustomed to eating frequently, once they were restricted to twice daily feedings of milk, they may have continued to search for food at frequent intervals and become familiar with consuming grain earlier. Initial and final BW were similar for S and B calves (Table 3). Total weight gain, total grain consumed, and total milk consumed were not different (P\n > 0.1) between treatments even though S calves weaned at an earlier age.",

By wk 2, the mean SPC for both groups of calves was approximately 5.5 g/dl and remained fairly constant through the rest of the study. The percent increase in SPC by 24 h after the first feeding for B calves was 42.4% with only 2 of the 15 B calves having SPC less than 5.0 g/dl. In comparison, the mean increase in SPC for S calves from birth to 24 h was only 28.5% and six of the 16 calves (37.5%) allowed to suckle had SPC of 5.0 g/dl or less; indicating greater transfer of passive immunity to B calves and less than desired transfer to S calves (Table 3). A SPC of 5.5 g/dl has been suggested as an indicator of minimal colostrum intake (Naylor et al., 1977; Wilson et al., 1994). Tyler et al. (1998), however, indicated that an SPC of 5.0 g/dl was a more reasonable goal based on the relative risk of mortalityfor calves with SPC less than 5.0 g/dl compared with calves with SPC > 5.0 g/dl. In a review of passive transfer of immunity in calves by Weaver et al.

(1970) also reported that of the calves that suckled, the beef calves suckled at a mean of 81.4 min after birth, whereas the calves from dairy heifers required a mean of 218.3 min and the calves from the dairy cows required 261.1 min. The authors suggested that dairy cows have been bred for high milk production, resulting in more developed mammary glands compared with wild ungulates, making dairy cows harder to suckle. Abel Francisco and Quigley (1993) reported a decrease in apparent efficiency of absorption of Ig within 1 h after birth. The delay in consumption of colostrum that can occur in dairy calves allowed to suckle compared with calves fed by bottle may have contributed to the lower SPC at 24 h in S calves compared with B calves. In the current study, calves that were not observed to be standing and attempting to nurse were fed a small amount of maternal colostrum by bottle or were aided in suckling so that differences in Ig absorption between S and B calves were not as great as may have occurred if calves were left to suckle alone. The calf that died in the current study either failed to suckle the dam or failed to absorb immunoglobulins. The calf was observed to be standing and moving about the stall after birth, but SPC did not increase from birth to 24 h.",

Pathogens detected from fecal samples of calves with diarrhea were Cryptosporidium parvum, coronavirus, and rotavirus.

The Jersey calves fed from bottles, however, were limited to only 2 L of colostrum (approximately 8% of BW) before obtaining the 24-h blood sample for analysis of passive transfer. Calves allowed to suckle the dam may have obtained a greater volume of colostrum than calves fed from a bottle, resulting in improved transfer of passive immunity for calves allowed to suckle. Stott et al. (1979b) also reported greater Ig absorption by Holstein calves allowed to suckle compared with calves fed by bottle; however, the amounts fed by bottle were limited to 1, 2, or 4 L during the first 12 h after birth. For the studies in which calves fed by bottle had better transfer of passive immunity, the amount fed to Holstein calves by bottle during the first 12 h varied considerably with volumes of 5.45 L (Nocek et al., 1984), 4.74 L (present study), and either 2.84 L at birth or 3.8 L during the first 12 h (Besser et al., 1991). In general, it appears that a volume of 2 L of colostrum at birth is the minimum that should be fed by bottle to a Holstein calf when the calf will only be fed twice during the first 12 h of life. In the present study using Holstein calves, seven of 15 calves voluntarily consumed 2.84 L by bottle during the first feeding and five more calves consumed between 2.6 and 2.84 L voluntarily. Only three calves required the use of an esophageal feeder for administration of colostrum. Therefore, 2.84 L of colostrum is likely the volume that should be fed at birth to maximize transfer of passive immunity without resorting to forced feeding of colostrum with an esophageal feeder.",

Producers also can insure calves ingest colostrum before gut closure, which occurs by about 24 h after birth (Stott et al., 1979a). Additionally, although feeding 4 L of colostrum at birth resulted in increased concentrations of Ig in serum compared with feeding 2 L of colostrum (Morin et al., 1997), calves may not voluntarily consume 4 L and must be fed using an esophageal feeder. Morin et al. (1997) reported that 7 of 11 calves (64%) fed 4 L at birth required the use of an esophageal feeder for one or more meals compared with 10 of 40 calves (25%) fed 2 L of colostrum.

Warner et al. (1973) reported that calves fed starter in meal form have greater intakes and daily weight gain than calves fed starter in pelleted form. The authors attributed the improved intake and performance obtained with meal to greater particle size of the starter and increased rumination. Beharka et al. (1998) fed calves a hay and grain diet either unground or ground to 1 mm particle size. They reported that calves fed the ground diet had less total surface area associated with dorsal papillae in the rumen compared with calves fed the diet that was not ground. Owen and Larson (1986), however, compared intake of calves fed starter as a meal form with the same mix in pelleted form and did not find differences in starter intake or performance. Pelleted and textured commercial starters had not been previously compared. The greater intakes and performance achieved with TS compared to PS may have been related to particle size of the PS compared to the TS.",

In the present study, calves fed GS and TS were voluntarily consuming at least 0.68 kg of starter feed by an average of approximately 4.5 wk of age and were weaned. Weaning at 4 to 5 wk of age compared with 8.7 wk of age could result in substantial savings for producers because starter feed generally is less expensive than milk replacer or tank milk (Heinrichs, 1993). Additionally, less labor is required to feed calves grain than milk or milk replacer. Finally, ruminal development occurs at an earlier age in calves weaned earlier (4 wk of age) compared with calves weaned at a more conventional age of 6 wk (Anderson et al., 1987). If calves prefer textured or ground starter over pelleted starter, consumption and performance could improve and age at weaning, health, and labor costs could decrease.",

These differences likely would have been greater if the S calves had not been aided at birth in suckling. This study lends support to current recommendations for removing the calf from the dam and feeding at least 2.84 L by nipple bottle. Physical form of the starter supplied to calves can have an impact on performance and age at weaning. Adequate transfer of passive immunity and decreased age at weaning with improved performance of calves will improve profitability of heifer rearing as well as decrease calf losses through mortality.",
