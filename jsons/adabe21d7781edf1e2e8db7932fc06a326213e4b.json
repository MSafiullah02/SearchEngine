The rate of paralysis was similar in both sexes, whereas lymphomas occurred twice as frequently in female as in male mice. The rate of paralysis was fairly constant at about 1% per month of the surviving colony until about 12 months; since then about 2% of the colony has become paralyzed each month (text- fig. 1 ).

Type-C VIrus particles were not seen in 12 specimens of br.ain or 3 of sciatic nerve from naturally paralyzed lce. In. the lower spinal cord, numerous type-C VIrus particles were noted in the extracellular spaces and, less frequently, budding singly from the plasma membrane of neurons ( fig. 5 ) and oligodendroglial cells. More commonly, neurons in the anterior horns of the lower spinal cord contained within their cytoplasm virus-like particles believed to be type-C Virus (see below). These particles budded into intracellular vacuoles and cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (figs. 6-8). The vacuoles were lined with smooth membranes from which many ,,:irions were .budding. Inside the vacuoles, some particles had bizarre shapes; membranous debris was also pre~ent. :Vit~in neurons, virus particles also budded m cyhndncal configuration from the mem-brane~of the. RER. Both budding and free particles were III the cI~terns of the RER, which were thereby moderately dilated. In cross section the free intracisternal particles measured 80-90~m in diameter and showed a trilamellar structure with smooth outer membrane and an electron-lucent core. Incompletely form~d particles, possibly nucleocapsid precursor matenal, were also seen occasionally within the RER. Smooth-walled vacuoles without virus particles were noted within neurons with or without virus particles elsewhere in their cytoplasm. This vacuolar change was more severe in those neurons which did not show virus particles. Occasionally an increase in the extracellular space was apparent: Other neurons were free of both virus particles and vacuoles and appeared normal in fine structure. ?nly neurons apparently contained the extensively intracellular replicating particles. A few intracisternal type-A particles were sometimes seen in neurons in the brain and spinal cord which did not c.ont~in t~e partic~es just described. Intracellular replicating VIrus particles were usually not in the skeletal musculature, although many type-C virus particles were in the interstitium close to the sarcolemma.",

The restriction of pathologic changes predominantly to the lower spinal cord distinguishes this paralytic disease from the spongiform encephalopathies. Another important difference, of course, is the absence of reported type-C particles in EM studies of the spongiform encephalopathies and human ALS material. In the natural and experimentally transmitted paralysis in mice, many typical type-C virus particles are seen by EM in the extracellular spaces of the spinal cord and, less frequently, budding from the plasma membrane of neurons and oligodendroglia. This correlates well with the detection of gs antigen by CF and recovery of infectious type-C virus in vitro from the spinal cord extracts of paralyzed mice (tables 1,3,4) . ",

Genetically mutant strains or unique envelope properties of \"wild\" type-C virus may account for distinct subpopulations of virus with specific neurotropic or oncogenic activity. Additional factors such as sex and age must be operating to account for the occurrence of lymphoma, which showed a somewhat different epidemiologic pattern. New cases of paralysis occurred at a similar incidence rate in both sexes during the 14 months of observation, but lymphomas predominated in female mice and increased in incidence over time. Somewhat unusual, however, are the many particles seen within the cytoplasm of anterior horn neurons of the lower spinal cord. Type-C particles typically replicate by budding from the plasma membrane of infected cells into the extracellular space without showing a cylindrical configuration. However, intracellular type-C virus identical to the intraneuronal particles with cylindrical budding into cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum has been described in several different murine cell types [megakaryocytes (20, 21) , alveolar (22) and epididymal epithelial cells (23) , and myelomonocytic cells (24) ] infected in vivo with laboratory strains of mouse leukemia virus. Moreover, intracytoplasmic vacuoles, like those seen in the mouse neurons, which contain membranous debris and shed from their lining numerous type-C particles, some with aberrant shape and size, have been described in murine (25, 26) and human (27) cells infected with mouse leukemia and sarcoma viruses. Therefore, we believe that the particles seen by EM within the cytoplasm of anterior horn neurons also represent type-C virus. The possibility that these intracellular particles are not virions or are some other unidentified species of virus seems remote but cannot be absolutely excluded. More detailed neuropathologic finestructural studies on these mice will be reported elsewhere (28, 29) .",

Thus we assume that early in life almost all these mice were infected and made relatively tolerant to their type-C virus.
