Traditional rapid diagnostics, such as immunoassays, produce quick results and are simple to perform but have sub-optimal sensitivity (Reviewed in [1]). NAATs, which are rapid and have enhanced sensitivity, are considered the method of choice by many and are recommended by IDSA Guidelines [[2], [3], [4]]. However, performance differences have been observed among commercial NAATs, particularly after 2014 when sequence divergence in the matrix gene of A(H3N2) viruses emerged [[5], [6], [7]]. Especially problematic was a C163 T mutation that was first observed among 3C.2a clades of A(H3N2) [[8], [9], [10]]. Commercial assays with significantly reduced sensitivities after the C163 T mutation emerged, included Prodesse ProFlu+ (PFlu) and Xpert\u00ae Flu (Xpt).",

The FluA component still targets the matrix gene, but it uses a dual target approach with multiple probes for added redundancy to help safeguard against genetic drift. Both FluB and RSV now target the matrix gene and the AdV hexon gene target is designed to detect all AdV genotypes. The gene targets for hMPV and PIV 4 are the nucleocapsid genes, while those for PIV 1\u20133 and RV are the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase region and the 5\u2032 UTR, respectively.

We also included RP2 and Xpress in this analysis as these assays were new to market and considered to have improved viral strain coverage. Fusion demonstrated excellent analytical sensitivity with low LODs ranging from 2.69 to 2.99 log copies/ml (Table 5\n). The LODs were highly consistent across the strains and clades of FluA. The assay was highly reproducible with coefficient of variances ranging from 0.5 to 4.2% across the dilutions (data not shown). RP2 and Xpress demonstrated improved analytical sensitivity and consistency as compared to the manufacturer\u2019s previous test systems. However, the LODs were still relatively higher, particularly with newly circulating A(H3N2) subclades.",

Prodesse assays had always been thought of as a necessary comparator system, if not the gold standard [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. But FluA target failures became common with A(H3N2) subclades that emerged in 2013 [7,9]. In fact, since 2014 most all circulating A(H3N2) viruses had M1 gene mutations which significantly affected the sensitivities of PFlu and Xpt. As a result, many manufacturers modified their systems to enable expanded clade coverage. Indeed, Hologic uses influenza redundancy in the design of the Panther Fusion FluA/B/RSV assay.",

Furthermore, many of these samples have been used in previous analyses of other systems, effectively enabling a multisystem analysis. In a recent study by Banerjee et al. [19], FFABR was compared to 5 FluA/B PCRs, including cIAB and RP. However, this study involved selected pediatric specimens collected over five respiratory virus seasons, as opposed to all specimens received within a period of high incidence, which is a better challenge of test sensitivity. In addition, pediatric cases are known to have higher viral titers, which also poses less of challenge with regards to test sensitivity. As a result, the sensitivities of all assays with this contrived population were comparable.",

It is not clear if this phenomenon is due to the greater analytic sensitivity of Fusion or due to true false viral detection. The superior analytical sensitivity was demonstrated in the LOD and endpoint dilution studies, in addition to the fact that the test performed exceptionally well with highly compromised samples in terms of specimen handling for maintaining viral RNA titers. Indeed, it appears the FP samples had much lower virus titers, as demonstrated by Ct values (Supplemental figure 1); hence, a system with superior analytical sensitivity would demonstrate better performance with such specimens. Furthermore, the additional positive viruses were only observed in samples collected during periods of high viral prevalence, for example during the 2-week period of 25% FluA incidence. False positive detection or signal would be a random event and be equally evident at periods of low viral incidence. It is also important to point out that 3 F P samples were due to RV and unfortunately, we only had one other system available in our lab to test for RV. Hence, there was no true referee of the difference in the two systems.",

However, the sensitives would decrease by 4 to 10%. It is also important to point out the choice of reference method in the absence of a gold standard has a significant impact on test performance. If this study involved submission of a diagnostic test to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a majority criteria would be required for a non-reference standard and a resolver test would not be allowed for the determination of positive and negative agreement, so as to prevent the introduction of bias in favor of the new test [21].

Likewise, Sanger sequencing which is often used as a resolver, it doesn\u2019t have a low LOD. For example, HIV genotyping can only be performed on patients with viral loads of 1000 copies/ml.
