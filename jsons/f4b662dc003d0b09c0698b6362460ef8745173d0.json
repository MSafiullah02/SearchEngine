Although most children with bronchiolitis have mild disease and are managed at home, infants admitted to hospital for the condition almost always have severe symptoms. 1, 2 The clinical relevance of the identification of the specific pathogens or combination of pathogens infecting a child remains unclear. However, children with human rhinovirus (hRV) may have different short-and long-term outcomes 3-8 compared to children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We showed that clinical severity was not correlated with the level of serum Krebs von den Lungen 6 antigen (KL-6), a biomarker of epithelial dysfunction, in previously healthy children, 9 which indicates that the various clinical outcomes depend more on the adaptive capacities of the host rather than the intensity of epithelial dysfunction. Prediction of the risk of recurrent wheezing or longterm asthma from the first year of life can be challenging. 10 Against this background, we decided to prospectively follow a cohort of infants with an early episode of acute bronchiolitis, either hospitalized or cared for at home. Our main objective was to assess the risk factors for developing symptoms of recurrent bronchial obstruction during a 3-year follow-up after an episode of bronchiolitis in the first year of life. The secondary objective was to identify in this cohort the risk factors associated with allergic sensitization at the age of 3.",

The 14-year cumulative incidence of asthma among children living in farming environments was 10.18%, which was significantly lower than that observed for children living in rural non-farming (13.12%) and non-rural environments (16.50%). This cohort study provides further evidence that living in a farming environment during childhood protects against asthma in adolescence and adulthood and provides further support for the hygiene hypothesis. 33, 34 However, we need to analyze our results on the environment carefully, as we analyzed respiratory outcome only after 3 years and throughout childhood or adulthood. 35 current atopy is considered if the child has either allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis. Other authors base the diagnosis of atopy on skin prick tests with or without association with physician diagnosis of allergy. 16, 36, 37 ) A co-infection of RSV and rhinovirus associated with an atopic predisposition promotes awareness of sensitization to aeroallergens. This finding is in agreement with a study suggesting that hRV plays a major role in triggering allergy. Two immunologic factors, low interferon responses and indicators of atopy (eosinophilia, allergen-specific IgEs), are closely associated with susceptibility to hRV-bronchiolitis. 38 Perez et al 39 ",

RSVA/B was the most common (50.9%), followed by entero/rhinovirus (21.6%). RSV dominated as the viral cause of respiratory distress. Since now, the role of RSV-hRV co-infection in bronchiolitis severity is not so clear, may be due to discrepancies in the detection of hRV. For instance, in a study from Miller et al 18 most HRV-C co-detections are with RSV. But finally in a larger study HRVs were statistically the least likely virus of 17 examined to be associated with co-infections. 19 However, Costa et al 20 showed that severe disease in hRV infections were caused mainly by presence of RSV in co-infections, in accordance with other results from Yoshida et al. 21 These results could suggest indirect evidence of a higher risk of subsequent asthma in infants RSV-hRV coinfected, as children with severe bronchiolitis during infancy have an increased early childhood asthma morbidity. 22 Our results, including outpatients and hospitalized children with both documented viral infections, may bring new insights about the role of RSV-hRV coinfection regardless of initial severity of bronchiolitis.",

Recent studies have often reported increased frequency of asthma in cases of acute bronchiolitis due to rhinoviruses. 4-7,24,25 Balekian et al 26 observed that the frequency of severe bronchiolitis and childhood asthma was similar to that in other documented reports. Among the children with severe bronchiolitis, 27.6% developed asthma by the age of 5 years. We observed a relationship between the occurrence of recurrent bronchial obstruction and the existence of an atopic or asthmatic family, as often reported in the literature. Midulla et al 4 identified rhinovirus infection and a positive familial history for asthma as major independent risk factors for recurrent wheezing. The same team published results at 3 years. 27 Blood eosinophils >400 cells/\u00b5L and rhinovirus infections were the major risk factors for recurrent wheezing.
