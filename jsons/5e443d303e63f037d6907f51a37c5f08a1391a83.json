Over the last 150 years, the development of powerful epidemiological tools to look at disease in populations has led to the identification of many causal risk factors for disease and provided the basis for disease prevention and health promotion programmes. In the 19th century, huge improvements in population health were made possible through knowledge and action on environmental factors such as poor housing or unclean water supplies. Last century public health programmes were largely aimed at the major lifestyle factors such as smoking, lack of exercise and poor nutrition that lay behind common chronic diseases; and vaccines were developed to prevent infectious diseases. In the last two decades or so, it has been recognized that knowledge of genomics and the application of new technologies can also contribute to the public health armamentarium through providing molecular insights into disease risk and pathology. Though initially work was mainly focused on genetics, namely the diagnosis and care of patients and families with inherited (or heritable) disorders, wider knowledge of the entire genome has enabled sub-populations at risk to be defined through a range of genomic characteristics or variations as well as by different exposures or lifestyles. Individuals with disease can also be grouped according to genomic factors associated with particular pathology or likely response to treatment. Similarly, pathogen genomics allows identification of genes responsible for characteristics such as antibiotic resistance or increased virulence, which can aid clinical management.

Notably, genetic testing has enabled major developments in the stages of disease at which screening may be offered. Genetic carrier testing now provides the means of identifying couples at risk of having offspring with serious medical conditions such as sickle cell disease at the preconception stage by identifying those where both partners are carriers of recessive variants; antenatal genetic testing can identify affected foetuses for conditions such as Down syndrome. Screening of newborns via the 'heel prick' test can identify babies who are at risk of life-limiting diseases such as phenylketonuria (PKU), most of which are heritable in origin. Antenatal and newborn screening are firmly embedded in national screening programmes in the UK. However, the opportunities for carrier screening mainly present for ethnic minority populations such as those of Ashkenazi Jewish origin who are at higher risk of rare genetic disorders such as Tay Sachs disease, 5 or for populations with high levels of consanguinity such as the Pakistani communities who are at higher risk for a range of autosomal recessive disorders. 6 Systematic population approaches to carrier screening, such as the programme in New York for disorders which are common in Jewish communities, 7 have been highly successful in reducing disease in these populations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1251, "end": 1252, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1397, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomics and disease prevention through screening"}, {"text": "The potential of screening for genetic changes that might be predictive of late-onset disorders is periodically discussed in scientific and clinical circles. 8 Important examples include mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that account for \u223c5% of breast cancer and 15% of ovarian cancer cases 9,10 or inherited The ability to define genetic markers that predict drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increased especially with the use of whole-genome sequencing.

At present, genetic screening for this group of conditions is only recommended in certain circumstances (for example, cascade testing from known cases (Lynch syndrome and FH) or testing for women at high risk, because of their family history). 12 Caution is urged before expanding use of such tests to people at 'population-level' risk, because the positive predictive value of any variants found would be much lower, and they would be harder to interpret. The development of genetic screening programmes at all these life stages in the UK at least is constrained by application of strict screening criteria designed to ensure optimum health benefit with least harm for the population as a whole. For example, only two inherited metabolic conditions (PKU and mediumchain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency) are screened for in newborns in the UK, whereas around the world >50 conditions are identified as being detectable through the new method of tandem mass spectrometry. After much debate and a 2-year pilot programme, a further four conditions will be added in England from November 2014. However, further pressure to expand programmes will undoubtedly arise as a result of such powerful new genomic technologies that enable faster, cheaper and safer examination of the genome and the possibility of looking for many conditions at once (Table 2) . Public health professionals will have an important role to play in this decision-making but, to do so they will need sufficient understanding of these new genomic technologies, the underlying science and the relationship of molecular pathologies to the diseases are in question.

The burden of morbidity they impose on the younger population is increased, because such diseases often have onset in childhood and are lifelong affecting many body systems.

Such protracted processes use health services resources to no avail while the condition often deteriorates without appropriate management. However, as genetic tests become more powerful, quicker and cheaper, the use of genetic testing earlier in a diagnostic pathway is increasingly advocated. For example, genomics 'array' testing as a first-line test for the paediatrician investigating developmental delay has been shown to be cost-effective compared with current pathways. 16 Diagnosing a serious inherited disease may give family members the opportunity for reproductive choice. This may be very important for parents who have had an affected child. Identification of the precise mutation involved in that child's disease enables the foetus, or even an embryo in the pre-implantation stage, to be tested so that the parents can take decisions not to allow a pregnancy to continue (or be established) if the child will be affected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 92, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 723, "end": 725, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomics and health care"}, {"text": "Of equal importance are the opportunities to identify family members who might be at risk so that they can be offered preventive treatment at an early stage. Returning to the example given above of FH, which leads to accelerated development of atherosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease with 50% of men and 30% of women being affected by age 55, 17 it is estimated that in the UK only \u223c15% of the 120 000 affected individuals are identified and receiving treatment. In 2013, a UK-focused workshop noted that new public health structures provided an opportunity to deliver systematic 'cascade' testing for FH that would start by discovering relevant mutations in affected individuals and sequentially test family members. They described such a programme as a 'quick win' for reducing cardiovascular disability and death in young people and one that would ultimately save health service expenditure. However, they emphasize that an integrated approach covering the whole disease pathway and involving many organizational players including public health would be required. 11 Genetic testing may also be used to identify important single gene subsets of disease that require different treatments. Diabetes provides a good example where identifying the genetic subtype Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) indicates to the physician that the patient will respond well to drug treatment with sulphonylureas rather than requiring insulin. 18 Cancer patients are cared for across all specialties within the health-care service and are a major user of health care with over 330 000 new cases in the UK each year. 19 Again, genomics is transforming care in this area. The detection of a tumour's genetic signature may be used to make a precise diagnosis, enabling a more accurate prognosis and better-tailored treatment. Increasingly, drugs are available that are targeted to the genetic features of a cancer, requiring genetic testing of the cancer cells to determine their potential response. For example, chemotherapy drugs such as Cetuximab, used for treating metastatic bowel cancer, target the epidermal growth factors (EGFR) signalling pathway to inhibit tumour growth. Their efficacy relies on the tumour cells retaining a normal KRAS protein; those tumour cells that have a mutated overactive KRAS will be resistant to anti EGFR therapy. 20 In the UK, a Government White Paper in 2003 and a more recent strategic report on genomics presented to the UK Department of Health and other government offices 21 have identified that developments in clinical applications of genomics are taking place throughout clinical medicine and not just within the confines of specialist genetic services. Alongside the development of laboratory services for accurate analysis and clear reporting that supports decision-making, both documents stressed that clinicians in all mainstream specialties will need to integrate these new 'genomically enabled' pathways for diagnosis and become competent at ordering and interpreting tests for their patients. What is perhaps less widely acknowledged is that these new paradigms will need to be shaped and developed on a population basis through public health advice.

This leads to the possibility for preventive public health that genetic testing could enable the population to be stratified by risk and preventive interventions targeted accordingly. For example, stratification of breast cancer risk may enable mammography to be offered earlier or more frequently to those at higher risk and less frequently, at a later age, or not at all to those at lower risk. Such strategies offering more intensive primary or secondary prevention interventions to those at greater genomic risk will become increasingly important in public health programmes that seek to maximize benefit while minimizing inconvenience or even harm and providing cost-effective services. 22 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1037, "end": 1039, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomics and common chronic disease prevention"}, {"text": "Despite a general decline in infections globally over the century, infectious pathogens remain important causes of morbidity and mortality with new and emerging pathogens continuing to pose a threat to global public health. The use of molecular and genomic approaches to study infectious disease aetiology, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment has recently substantially increased. 23 New sequencing technologies applied to pathogen genomes have multiple uses in the area of infectious disease, including surveillance, investigating transmission and understanding pathogenesis. Relatively cheap sequencing of pathogen genomes allows rapid characterization of microorganisms, identification of key virulence factors and antibiotic resistance profile (useful in determining the best treatment options for a given patient), monitoring the spread of antibiotic resistant strains and detection, mapping and analysis of outbreaks. It has already been used to identify the probable sources of both hospital-and community-based disease outbreaks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 386, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health protection"}, {"text": "Within surveillance, whole-genome sequencing allows trends (for example, in drug resistance or vaccine escape) to be identified and monitored in more detail than is possible with conventional surveillance methods; this in turn allows the development of hypotheses that can be rigorously tested in epidemiological studies. For example, based on a phylogenetic tree constructed using whole-genome sequences from clinical isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Harris et al. 24 identified instances of probable international spread and also estimated that the responsible MRSA clonal lineage (ST239) emerged in the mid-to-late 1960s, a date which was consistent with the timing of increased antibiotic usage and the first detection of MRSA in Europe. Vaccine escape mutants have been identified through phylogenetic analysis of isolates of the PMEN1 clone of Streptococcus pneumoniae; recent (2005-07) isolates from the USA were distinct from older USA isolates, implying that the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000 had changed the population distribution of the organism. 25 Genome sequencing can also provide baseline data before the introduction of a vaccination programme, allowing prospective evaluation of potential changes in epidemiology. 26 Whole-genome sequencing can supplement traditional epidemiological methods in studies investigating transmission of infection. It has potential uses in investigating both small clusters and larger outbreaks of infection, providing timely information on evolutionary origin, route of transmission, pathogenic potential and drug resistance (if genes and/or gene variants influencing these characteristics are known). Comparing the genome sequences of pathogens isolated from different hosts can aid in inferring patterns of transmission when considered together with epidemiological data. Although the identification of two identical strains cannot prove that two cases are epidemiologically linked, putative chains of transmission can be ruled out if the infecting strains are found to be different. Genome sequencing has been used in a variety of outbreak investigations to establish likely networks of transmission and explain the mechanism of spread through a population, e.g. transmission of MRSA within and between hospital units and the community, 27 persistence of Klebsiella pneumoniae on a ventilator despite thorough cleaning 28 and identifying potential superspreaders. 29 It has also been used to identify likely camel-to-human transmission of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. 30 For animal health, WGS of pathogens isolated from different animal hosts can help to elucidate the transmission dynamics within and between species, e.g. the transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between cattle and between badgers and cattle. 31 Genome sequencing can improve understanding of the natural history of infection, for example inferring whether a second episode of tuberculosis disease in a particular patient is due to relapse or reinfection. 32 Whole-genome sequencing can also be used to identify virulence factors, which in the future may be investigated for associations with pathogenicity, mortality, transmissibility and drug resistance. 33 It can also provide insights into the likely processes through which drug resistance develops. For example, the structure of the phylogenetic tree in relation to drug resistance, constructed for M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Russia, suggested that resistance to fluoroquinolones and pyrazinamide was acquired during infection rather than pre-existing in the infecting strain; this in turn suggested that strains resistant to these antibiotics might be less transmissible than susceptible strains. 34 While there is much potential for genome sequencing to become a useful tool for infectious disease epidemiologists, it does have potential limitations. Studies involving whole-genome sequencing are subject to the same potential sources of error as any epidemiological study (such as chance, bias and confounding). Additional considerations for genomic epidemiology studies include the need to distinguish between asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic patients, the standardization of laboratory methods and the ease with which particular loci of interest can be sequenced (e.g. sequencing repeat regions is problematic). The definition of strain differences, e.g. in terms of numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences (variation in a single base pair of DNA), can also be difficult.

This means that increasingly high-income countries define the agenda for research; results are most relevant to them, and an accelerating health divide becomes inevitable. 36 The 2002 WHO report 'Genomics and World Health' identified many concerns and opportunities for using genomics to improve world health, many of which remain largely relevant today. 37 As described by Kumar 38 in a major textbook on genomics in the developing world, for many developing countries the main opportunities remain those around inherited disorders. For example, sickle cell and thalassaemia, with their recessive inheritance patterns, cause major burden of disease, especially in countries where there are high levels of consanguinity. The burden of disease in developing countries from preventable birth defects prompted the World Health Assembly in 2010 to declare this as a significant problem and urged them to take action. However, many barriers to such action exist, including difficulties in persuading senior policymakers to recognize the potential of genomics, and the lack of genetic expertise and service provision available for these very large, poor populations.
