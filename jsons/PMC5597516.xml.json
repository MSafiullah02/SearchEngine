            "text": "Influenza viruses A and B are negative\u2010sense, single\u2010strand RNA viruses in the Orthomyxoviridae family. To combat these pathogenic viruses, seasonal influenza vaccines are formulated, and annual vaccination is recommended by the CDC for everybody 6 mo or older for the 2016\u20132017 flu season [1]. During the 2014\u20132015 flu season, the CDC estimated that \u223c150 million doses of influenza vaccine were distributed in the United States [2]. Despite the availability of these seasonal vaccines, annual estimated mortality from 1977 to 2007 from influenza ranged from 3349 to 48,614 deaths [3], peaking when influenza A (H3N2) circulated in the population [4]. These vaccines are only protective when the circulating strains of influenza closely match the vaccine strains, and the fact that many people do not get immunized can explain these statistics. Importantly, these seasonal influenza vaccines do not protect against newly emerging strains that could potentially cause large outbreaks or pandemics in the future. In addition to the mortality and morbidity associated with the viral infection, coinfections can exacerbate the outcome of influenza infection, as exemplified by the 1918 pandemic, in which most deaths were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia [5]. Secondary bacterial infection after influenza infection accounts for a significant number of deaths worldwide [6]. Therefore, it would be a valuable aid to public health to have therapeutic options for treating influenza\u2010infected individuals. This was an unmet need in the 2014\u20132015 influenza season, in which the circulating influenza A (H3N2) strain was a drift variant of the seasonal vaccine strain, resulting in a vaccine with reduced efficacy [7].",

            "text": "In nonimmunized individuals, the first barriers to influenza infection are cells of the innate immune system. These cells are capable of recognizing the invading virus, and that innate recognition is essential for initiating an adaptive immune response. According to pattern\u2010recognition theory [8], cells of the innate immune system identify pathogens through germline\u2010encoded proteins called pattern\u2010recognition receptors. These proteins identify pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns present in the invading microorganisms. In the case of influenza infection, the cytosolic RNA helicase RIG\u2010I has an important role in recognition, triggering production of protective proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and antiviral type I IFNs [9]. It is theorized that the host cell can distinguish the viral RNA from cellular RNA because of a panhandle structure in its 5\u2032\u2010triphosphorylated terminus [10]. However, the influenza protein NS1 is capable of antagonizing RIG\u2010I\u2013dependent signaling [11], highlighting the need for redundancy in innate immune recognition. TLR3 can also recognize viral RNA [12] and has been shown to be activated in response to influenza infection in human lung epithelial cells to induce proinflammatory cytokines [13]. In certain cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, TLR7 can also recognize influenza genomic RNA [14].",

            "text": "Innate immune recognition does not occur exclusively through recognition of pathogen substructures. Influenza infection can induce cellular stress, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which can culminate in NLRP3\u2010dependent activation of caspase\u20101, leading to release of the proinflammatory mediators IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 [15]. Infected cells can also release DAMPs to alert neighboring cells of the danger. S100A9 is produced during in vitro infection with influenza A virus [16], whereas HMGB1 is a DAMP that is released during in vivo influenza infections in both mice and humans [17, 18]. Reactive oxygen species released by cells in the lungs of humans and animals during viral infection can cause oxidation of endogenous phospholipids to produce oxidized phosphatidylcholine [19, 20]. Importantly, oxidized phospholipids, HMGB1, and S100A9 have all been shown to signal through TLR4 [16, 21, 22]. Relevantly, we reported that TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice were resistant to infection with mouse\u2010adapted influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (PR8) [20, 23], as well as a more potent, mouse\u2010adapted strain ma\u2010Ca/04 [24]. The TLR4\u2010specific antagonist Eritoran (E5564; Eisai Co., Tokyo, Japan) blocked lethality and clinical symptoms caused by PR8 infection when given starting 2 d after infection [20]. Blocking TLR4 signaling on d 2 or on d 2 and d 4 after PR8 infection with an anti\u2010TLR4\u2013specific Ab also conferred protection [25]. These and other TLR4 antagonists identified by our group [26, 27] indicate that TLR4 antagonists may represent a novel class of drugs for use in treating patients with influenza.",

            "text": "Defensins are small, cysteine\u2010rich, cationic peptides that primarily serve as innate immune defense mechanisms against infectious microorganisms. Unlike the \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010defensins, \u03b8\u2010defensins are circular, formed by head\u2010to\u2010tail ligation of 2 truncated \u03b1\u2010defensin\u2013like precursor peptides and possess broad antimicrobial activity, targeting bacteria, viruses, and fungi [28, 29, 30, 31\u201332]. All 6 human \u03b8\u2010defensin (DEFT) pseudogenes contain a premature stop codon, preventing translation [33, 34]. However, solid\u2010phase peptide synthesis has allowed researchers to construct artificially humanized \u03b8\u2010defensins, called RCs [35]. The individual RCs vary slightly in the noncysteine amino residues but bind with high affinity to N\u2010 and O\u2010linked glycosylated proteins, such as HIV gp120 [36], and to prevent fusion mediated by influenza hemagglutinin [37]. Consequently, RCs can effectively prevent in vitro infection of human cell lines with either HIV [35, 38] or influenza A virus [39]. Similarly, RCs are protective in vitro against HSV\u20101/2 through binding to its surface glycoprotein [40]. In addition to their role in fighting microorganisms, defensins might also have a key regulatory role in limiting tissue\u2010damaging inflammation. Human \u03b2\u2010defensin 3 can inhibit TLR4\u2010dependent signaling in vitro and in vivo [41, 42]. RTDs prevent cytokine secretion from human blood leukocytes treated with multiple TLR ligands [43], including the TLR4 agonist LPS [44], demonstrating that \u03b8\u2010defensins can also regulate host responses mediated by cellular glycoproteins. This also suggests a role for the structurally similar RCs in TLR antagonism. Clinically, RCs could represent a novel therapeutic against influenza infection, inhibiting the detrimental production of TLR4\u2010dependent cytokines and blocking infection of the virus or coinfecting bacteria. The aims of our study were to determine whether RC\u2010101 could inhibit LPS\u2010induced TLR4 signaling and whether RC\u2010101 could be used therapeutically against influenza\u2010mediated disease.",

Because RC\u2010101 is structurally similar to those RTDs, we hypothesized that RC\u2010101 would antagonize TLR4\u2010mediated signaling, leading to cytokine induction. Consistent with that prediction, RC\u2010101 inhibited LPS\u2010induced IFN\u2010\u03b2 in a dose\u2010dependent manner (\nFig. 1A\n). Induction of IFN\u2010\u03b2 was decreased in the presence of RC\u2010101 as early as 60 min after LPS treatment (Fig. 1B). Signal transduction in response to LPS is initiated by homodimerization of TLR4 [55]. TLR4 signal transduction contains a unique bifurcation, using both MyD88 and TRIF as adaptor proteins [56, 57]. IFN\u2010\u03b2 is considered a MyD88\u2010independent gene induced downstream of the TLR4\u2013TRIF pathway [56, 58]. In contrast to IFN\u2010\u03b2, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2 represent 2 MyD88\u2010dependent cytokines [56].

The biologic activity of LPS was measured in the LAL assay in the presence or absence of RC\u2010101 to determine whether our cytokine expression results were likely due to a interaction between RC\u2010101 and LPS. The biologic activity of 1 endotoxin U/ml (\u223c0.1 ng/ml) of LPS was partially inhibited by 30 \u03bcg/ml RC\u2010101 and almost completely inhibited by 100 \u03bcg/ml RC\u2010101 (\nFig. 3A\n). The dose of LPS used in the cell\u2010free LAL assay represents a 1000\u2010fold lower dose of LPS than used for M\u03d5 TLR4 stimulation (e.g., see Fig. 1). To test more\u2010relevant doses of LPS, we used a different LAL assay that had a linear range up to 50 EU/ml and maintained the dose of RC\u2010101 at 30 \u03bcg/ml. Under those conditions, RC\u2010101 (30 \u03bcg/ml) strongly inhibited the biologic activity of all LPS doses tested, including 50 EU/ml (Fig. 3B). RC\u2010101 also inhibited the LAL activity of biotinylated LPS at doses ranging from 1 to 100 ng/ml (Fig. 3C), suggesting that it is likely that RC\u2010101 inhibits TLR4 signaling, in part, by sequestration of LPS. To examine that possibility further, we performed an in vitro pulldown assay with biotinylated LPS in the presence or absence of RC\u2010101. RC\u2010101 did not impair the ability of streptavidin beads to pull down LPS\u2010biotin (Fig. 3D). Additionally, RC\u2010101 was recovered upon pulldown of biotinylated LPS with streptavidin beads, suggesting direct binding between RC\u2010101 and LPS (Fig. 3D). To verify that this binding was specific, an excess of unlabeled LPS E. coli K235 was also added to the mix before pulldown. Excess unlabeled LPS prevented the pulldown of RC\u2010101 with biotinylated LPS, suggesting that the binding of LPS and RC\u2010101 is specific (Fig. 3D). In contrast to its interaction with LPS, RC\u2010101 was not pulled down by the biotinylated TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 (Fig. 3E).",

For that reason, we also sought to explore the capacity of RC\u2010101 to disrupt TLR4 dimers, using a model of TLR4 oligomerization that occurs in the absence of ligands. Our laboratory has previously shown that overexpression of FLAG\u2010tagged TLR4 in HEK293T cells can facilitate TLR4\u2010dependent signaling in the absence of LPS [53]. Cotransfection of TLR4\u2010FLAG and TLR4\u2010CFP induced a physical interaction between the 2 TLR4 constructs, as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation of the 2 epitope tags (Fig. 4C). Using that model, we examined whether RC\u2010101 could destabilize the interaction. Addition of RC\u2010101 failed to inhibit the coimmunoprecipitation of TLR4\u2010CFP with TLR4\u2010FLAG (Fig. 4D).",

TLR2\u2010dependent cytokine secretion has been shown to be regulated by RTDs in human blood leukocytes [43], so TLR2 might be expected to be regulated by RC\u2010101, similar to TLR4. In our laboratory, RC\u2010101 also inhibited proinflammatory, TLR2\u2010dependent gene induction in mouse M\u03d5s (\nFig. 5A and B\n), demonstrating that RC\u2010101\u2013mediated inhibition is not restricted to TLR4; however, RC\u2010101 failed to bind to biotinylated Pam3CSK4 (Fig. 3E). Therefore, inhibition of signaling is not restricted to agonists that RC\u2010101 can bind directly. To further determine the degree of pathway specificity of RC\u2010101\u2013mediated inhibition, mouse M\u03d5s were also stimulated with non\u2010TLR agonists in its absence or presence. RC\u2010101 failed to inhibit cytokine gene induction in response to either recombinant TNF\u2010\u03b1 or DMXAA (Fig. 5C\u2013F). DMXAA is a potent inducer of TBK1\u2010dependent IFN\u2010\u03b2 in mouse M\u03d5s through intracellular activation of STING [50], unlike TLR4 and TLR2, which initiate signaling extracellularly. Note that the apparent lack of induction of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in response to LPS in Fig. 5E was due to a suboptimal time point for its expression (see Fig. 1). Collectively, these latter results demonstrate that RC\u2010101 is not a universal inhibitor of innate immune signaling pathways.",

The effect of RC\u2010101 on PR8 infection was first examined in an in vitro infection model. In WT M\u03d5s, infected for 8 and 24 h in vitro, RC\u2010101 inhibited PR8\u2010induced expression of the proinflammatory genes encoding pro\u2013IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 (\nFig. 6A and B\n). Although TNF\u2010\u03b1 secretion by PR8\u2010infected M\u03d5s has been shown to be partially TLR4 dependent [16], we observed that induction of pro\u2013IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA was not significantly impaired in PR8\u2010infected TLR4\u2212/\u2212 M\u03d5s at 8 h postinfection (Fig. 6C and D). Similarly, PR8\u2010infected TRIF\u2212/\u2212 or IRAK4KDKI M\u03d5s induced similar amounts of IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA in response to PR8 as WT controls (Fig. 6E and F). IRAK4 is the first kinase recruited to MyD88 during signal transduction, and IRAK4KDKI M\u03d5s behave comparably to MyD88\u2212/\u2212 M\u03d5s [49]. This suggests that the DAMPs that activate TLR4\u2010dependent or other TLR\u2010dependent signaling in vivo are likely not present in our in vitro model at the time points tested. This result also indicates that RC\u2010101 influences cytokine induction during in vitro infection independent of TLR4, possibly by inhibiting the signaling of some other non\u2010TLR pattern\u2010recognition receptors, such as RIG\u2010I, which is also capable of recognizing PR8 [9]. HMGB1 is a DAMP that has been shown to be released during influenza infection in mice and humans [17, 18]. Importantly, HMGB1 is also known to activate TLR4\u2010dependent signaling [22]. RC\u2010101 suppressed cytokine gene induction in response to HMGB1 (Fig. 6G and H), demonstrating that it can also block TLR4\u2010mediated gene expression mediated by DAMPs.",

            "text": "Although the innate immune system has a crucial role in initiating an immune response against an invading microorganism, overexuberant signaling may actually contribute to pathology during the same infection. This double\u2010edged sword effect of inflammation in response to innate immune signaling is illustrated during infection with influenza virus. The TLR adaptor MyD88 is required for mouse survival after infection with PR8 [59]. Further illustrating the beneficial role of innate signaling pathways, pretreatment of mice with TLR4 or TLR2 agonists, before in vivo infection with influenza, has been shown to be protective [60, 61\u201362]. However, the timing of those signaling pathways is crucial because oxidative stress in the lung during infection with PR8 has been linked to the development of oxidized phospholipids [20] and other DAMPs that mediate TLR4 signaling\u2010dependent acute lung injury [19]. The detrimental role of inflammation can be further exacerbated by bacterial coinfection [63]. Because of the role of TLR4 during PR8 infection, TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice are refractory to lethality associated with PR8 infection [20, 23]. In further support of the role of oxidized phospholipids in mediating TLR4\u2010dependent lethality, mortality can be prevented by inhibiting oxidized phospholipid formation by administering the antioxidant N\u2010acetyl cysteine [64]. Additionally, we reported that mortality can be prevented by inhibiting TLR4 signaling after PR8 infection with the potent synthetic TLR4 antagonist Eritoran [20], an anti\u2010TLR4 Ab [25], and other agents that block TLR4 signaling [26, 27]. Thus, we hypothesized that drugs that target host\u2010cell, TLR4\u2010dependent signaling pathways could potentially function as novel anti\u2010influenza therapies.",

            "text": "In our study, RC\u2010101 was fully capable of inhibiting LPS\u2010dependent signaling in both mouse and human M\u03d5s. The impairment of both MyD88\u2010 and TRIF\u2010signaling pathways suggests that RC\u2010101 could function by preventing the initial interaction of LPS with TLR4, either through sequestration of LPS or blockade of the signaling event itself. Based on our study, we cannot rule out the strong possibility that a significant part of the TLR4 inhibition by RC\u2010101 is mediated by LPS sequestration from the TLR4 signaling complex because RC\u2010101 could both bind LPS in in vitro pulldown assays and inhibit a broad range of LPS bioactivity in cell\u2010free LAL assays. However, the dose of LPS used to stimulate M\u03d5s in our study was in the saturation range, where only strong antagonists would be expected to have a significant effect on cytokine gene expression. Signal transduction in response to LPS is initiated at the plasma membrane by homodimerization of TLR4 molecules [55]. The ectodomain of human TLR4 contains 9 N\u2010linked glycosylation sites that are required for cell\u2010surface expression and function [65]. Removal of those sialic acid residues increases LPS\u2010dependent signaling [66], suggesting that those sialic residues may be at the interface of TLR4 dimerization. Because RCs bind with high affinity to proteins exhibiting N\u2010 and O\u2010linked glycosylation [36], we hypothesized that RC\u2010101 could antagonize TLR4\u2010mediated signaling by binding to the glycans on TLR4 to prevent ligand\u2010induced dimerization. In line with that theory, human \u03b2\u2010defensin 3 can also inhibit TLR4\u2010dependent signaling through direct binding to TLR4 [67]. Using a model of ligand\u2010independent oligomerization of TLR4 in HEK293T cells, we tested whether RC\u2010101 could prevent or disrupt homotypic TLR4 interactions. Addition of RC\u2010101 failed to disrupt oligomers of TLR4 in this assay, which could mean that RC\u2010101 does not target TLR4 directly or that its binding sites were unavailable in this conformation. Unfortunately, we could not decrease the input concentrations of the TLR4 plasmids used for transfection to a level that permitted ligand\u2010dependent signaling but that would still permit detection of coimmunoprecipitated TLR4\u2010FLAG and TLR4\u2010CFP molecules. The MD\u20102 protein is a crucial part of the LPS recognition complex [68] and is also glycosylated [65], so it is also possible that MD\u20102, and not TLR4, might be the primary target of RC\u2010101 in this pathway.",

            "text": "In addition to inhibition of LPS\u2010dependent signaling, we also found that Pam3CSK4\u2010dependent activation of TLR2 signaling was inhibited by RC\u2010101. In contrast to its direct interaction with LPS, RC\u2010101 was unable to interact with Pam3CSK4 in vitro. This suggests that RC\u2010101 has the capacity to act in more ways than solely by ligand sequestration. Human TLR2 also contains glycosylation sites [69], which could be a putative target of RC\u2010101. Alternatively, TLR\u2010dependent signal transduction is sensitive to the architecture of lipid\u2010membrane microdomains [70]. Addition of a phosphatidylserine species can impair both TLR4 and TLR2 signaling pathways [70]. Given that the positively charged RC\u2010101 has been found to bind to anionic membranes, such as dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol [71], it is tempting to speculate that the ability of RC\u2010101 to block both TLR4\u2010 and TLR2\u2010dependent signaling is caused by an effect on the cell membrane itself. However, such a mechanism seems less likely because TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2013mediated signaling, which also requires receptor oligomerization [72], was not perturbed by RC\u2010101.",

            "text": "The fusion protein for respiratory syncytial virus can be recognized in a TLR4\u2010dependent manner [73], but no influenza protein has been identified that can function as a TLR4 ligand. In contrast, DAMPs, such as HMGB1, are released during in vivo infection, and they signal through TLR4. It is less clear whether those DAMPs are produced in vitro and how much of an effect they have on gene regulation. Secretion of proinflammatory genes at 24 h postinfection with PR8 has been shown to be MyD88\u2010dependent in bone marrow\u2013derived and peritoneal M\u03d5s [16, 26]. However, TNF\u2010\u03b1 protein secretion at 12 and 24 h was only decreased by \u223c20\u201330% in the absence of TLR4, exhibiting only a partial TLR4 dependence [16]. Our data, using the IRAK4KDKI M\u03d5s, indicate that the difference in cytokine production mediated by a lack of MyD88\u2010dependent signaling is not due to a defect in transcriptional up\u2010regulation of MyD88\u2010dependent genes, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 or IL\u20101\u03b2, at 8 h postinfection. As part of its role as an innate immune adaptor protein, MyD88 has also been shown to be involved in stabilization of mRNA species containing adenosine\u2010 and uridine\u2010rich elements, which are common to many cytokines [74]. So, we surmise that the TLR4\u2013MyD88 pathway may be mediating its effect on cytokine secretion in response to PR8 through alterations in mRNA stability and not through altered transcription.",

            "text": "RCs offer the potential to limit inflammation mediated by DAMPs and also to target the virus itself. Although RC\u2010101 may act by blocking initial viral entry, as previously described [37], it has been shown to be less effective against the mouse\u2010adapted PR8 than against other influenza strains [39]. For instance, preincubating the virus with various different RCs for 30 min achieved only an \u223c60% decrease in viral infectivity, as measured by a fluorescent focus formation assay [39]. Importantly, none of our experiments featured preincubation of the virus with RC\u2010101, which would further limit the ability of RC\u2010101 to block the virus directly. As a proof of concept that RCs can be used therapeutically, RC\u2010101 was tested in a mouse model of influenza infection. Treatment with RC\u2010101, starting 2 d postinfection, was shown to lessen the severity of PR8\u2010associated disease, resulting in a highly significant increase in survival (Fig. 7). Our results on the inhibition of TLR4\u2010mediated cytokine expression are consistent with the possibility that antagonism of TLR4 signaling accounts, at least in part, for protection in PR8\u2010infected mice. That the protective, therapeutic effect of RC\u2010101 against PR8 is similar to what we have previously reported for the TLR4 antagonist Eritoran [20] suggests that RC\u2010101 may act in vivo, at least partially, through TLR4 antagonism. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of an additional direct effect on the virus itself, as has been observed by others [37, 39]. Although Eritoran does not directly kill influenza in vitro [20], Eritoran therapy was associated with decreased influenza titers in vivo, but not until d 6 after infection [20], which highlights an important connection between inflammation and viral replication in this infection model. It is quite possible that the effect of RC\u2010101 in this system is both antiviral and anti\u2010inflammatory.",

Therefore, RC\u2010101 would be predicted to be more effective against human strains with increased glycosylation [76]. Similar to the efficacy demonstrated by RC\u2010101 in our study, RTDs protected mice from a lethal lung infection with a mouse\u2010adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus and limited the potentially overexuberant cytokine response occurring in the lung [77].
