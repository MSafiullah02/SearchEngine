Whilst human PyV infections are generally asymptomatic, they can cause severe disease particularly in the immunosuppressed. Common examples include BKPyV-associated nephropathy and haemorrhagic cystitis, JCPyV-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and MCPyV-positive Merkel cell carcinoma (Feng et al., 2008; Gardner et al., 1971; Knowles, 2006; Padgett et al., 1971). Current therapies to treat PyV-induced diseases are limited, therefore there is a need to develop new strategies.",

Under each pentamer sits a minor capsid protein linking VP1 to the viral genome (Hurdiss et al., 2016). The majority of PyVs, including SV40, BKPyV and JCPyV encode two minor capsid proteins (VP2 and VP3) which are incorporated into the capsid. MCPyV is however part of a small clade of PyVs that express only one minor capsid protein (VP2) (Schowalter and Buck, 2013).",

            "text": "All PyVs must deliver their genomes to the nucleus, commonly achieved by trafficking through the endosomal system (Qian et al., 2009; Tsai and Qian, 2010). Initial attachment varies across PyV species but typically involves sialylated glycans. SV40 interacts with MHC-1 and GM1 gangliosides in lipid rafts, whilst MCPyV interacts with sulphated glycosaminoglycans including heparan sulphate or chondroitin sulphate prior to secondary interactions with sialylated glycans to facilitate virus penetration (Anderson et al., 1998; Clayson et al., 1989; Miller-Podraza et al., 1982; Schowalter et al., 2011; Stang et al., 1997). Following binding, JCPyV enters cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whilst SV40, MCPyV and BKPyV enter via caveolar/lipid rafts (Becker et al., 2019; Eash et al., 2004; Gilbert and Benjamin, 2000; Mayberry et al., 2019; Moriyama et al., 2007; Pho et al., 2000). Virions traffic through the endosomal system and in response to endosomal cues, including endosome acidification, initiate proteolytic rearrangements of the capsid prior to retrograde trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Becker et al., 2019; Engel et al., 2011; Kuksin and Norkin, 2012; Mercer et al., 2010). Within the ER, virions are further disassembled, exposing nuclear localisation signals (NLSs) that transport capsids to the nucleus via importins (Geiger et al., 2011; Nakanishi et al., 2007, 2002; Nishikawa et al., 2001; Pelkmans et al., 2001; Schelhaas et al., 2007; Yamada and Kasamatsu, 1993). Despite this knowledge, the endosomal cues that permit PyV trafficking remain poorly understood.",

In the context of PyV infection, Ca2+ ions have been shown to affect the structure and organisation of virus particles, regulating their disassembly through virion swelling (Asor et al., 2019; Hover et al., 2018; Ishizu et al., 2001; Li et al., 2003). However, despite the evidence that cellular ion channels are targeted by a wide range of viruses to enhance specific lifecycle stages, their role during PyV entry has not been defined (Choi et al., 2008; Dubey et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2015; Gehring et al., 2014; Herrmann et al., 2010; Hover et al., 2018; Igloi et al., 2015; Mankouri et al., 2009; Sakurai et al., 2015; Stakaityte et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2014).

To achieve this, reporter-containing MCPyV pseudovirions (PsVs) that behave in a similar manner to WT viruses were used alongside native SV40 virions to specifically assess virus entry through high-throughput fluorescence-based detection systems. Herein, we show that MCPyV and SV40 are differentially sensitive to K+ channels and transient (T-type) Ca2+ channel inhibitors. We further identify a shared requirement of SV40 and MCPyV for the activity of endosomal nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-Sensitive Two-Pore Ca2+ Channels (TPCs) that regulate ER-endosome membrane contact sites. These findings reveal potential therapeutic drug targets for PyVs and enhance our understanding of the virus entry processes.",

We therefore focussed on developing high throughput assays to permit antiviral screening of early events. Initially, we established a fluorescence detection system to monitor the expression of SV40 T-antigens following virus infection using an Incucyte ZOOM instrument, in a manner comparable to previous methods described for Hepatitis C virus measurement (Fig. 1\nA-B) (Charlton et al., 2019; Stewart et al., 2015). The system could reproducibly quantify the number of SV40 T-antigen positive cells and could be used as a rapid method to assess the levels of virus infection (Fig. 1C-D). Whilst an infectious system has previously been reported using dermal fibroblasts, the study of MCPyV remains more challenging as such systems require extensive manipulation through supplement of chemical inhibitors (Liu et al., 2016). We therefore applied reporter-containing PsVs that permit the assessment of MCPyV entry and genome release into the nucleus. MCPyV PsVs transduced target cells more slowly than SV40 infection, with detectable fluorescence observed between 48 to 72 hpt, consistent with previously reported timescales (Fig. 1E-F) (Becker et al., 2019). Using these systems, SV40 infections and MCPyV transductions could be performed in a 96- or 24-well plate format, respectively, providing a platform for high-throughput antiviral compound screening.",

Examples include the negative sense RNA viruses, bunyamwera virus and influenza virus that require K+ during endosomal transit to mediate virus priming and endosomal escape (Hover et al., 2018, 2016; Stauffer et al., 2014). We therefore explored whether regulators of two of the major endosomal ion channel families, namely K+ or Ca2+ channels, were important for PyV entry. We selected a pharmacological approach to specifically target channel functionality since gene-silencing approaches can ablate other cellular roles of the ion channel proteins. Treatment of cells with the broad spectrum K+ channel inhibitor tetraethylammonium (TEA) and broad-spectrum Ca2+ channel inhibitor verapamil inhibited MCPyV infection by 62% and 57%, respectively, suggesting that both channel families were important during MCPyV entry (Fig. 3\nA-B). In contrast, TEA had little to no-effect on SV40 infection (Fig. 3C), whereas Verapamil treatment caused a 57% reduction in SV40 infection (Fig. 3D), suggesting a conserved requirement of Ca2+ channels.",

To identify which K+ channel subfamilies are required during MCPyV entry, we investigated the effects of KCl (to destroy K+ gradients and thus K+ channel function) and 4-aminopyridine (4AP, a KV channel blocker) on MCPyV and SV40 infection. Both KCl and 4AP inhibited MCPyV, however 4AP had no effect upon SV40 (Fig. 4\nA-B). Furthermore, the anti-malarial drug quinine that promiscuously blocks a variety of K+ channels through an unknown mechanism had no effect on either MCPyV or SV40. These data highlighted differences in MCPyV and SV40 entry processes and suggested that MCPyV can be blocked by inhibitors of 4AP sensitive, quinine insensitive Kv channels.",

Given that PyVs traffic through the ER and verapamil treatment led to a negative phenotype independent of the assessed Ca2+ channel inhibitors, the importance of TPCs during MCPyV and SV40 entry was investigated. Gabapentin, an L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor had no effect on MCPyV or SV40, which was comparable with nitrendipine treatment (Fig. 6\nA&C). However, treatment with the TPC inhibitor tetrandrine led to a striking concentration-dependent inhibition of both viruses, with near complete abolishment of fluorescent cells for MCPyV and SV40 at 5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 6B&C).

However, the specific routes of endosomal translocation and the host factors required during trafficking to the ER remain largely undefined and better understanding of this will aid in the search for antivirals. Whilst it has long been understood that the acidification of endosomes is essential for PyV entry cues, the endosomal balance of other ions and their crucial roles during the infection of a plethora of viruses is only beginning to emerge (Hover et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2009). There is a long-standing acceptance that acidification of maturing endosomes and lysosomes is due to the translocation of H+, which whilst true, only reflects one aspect of the highly dynamic ionic flux that regulates compartmental pH (Scott and Gruenberg, 2011). Given that ion channels regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, there is an array of well characterised pharmaceutically available drugs that can be used to treat many diseases. The ability to identify and repurpose drugs is therefore a viable and cost effective means of restricting PyV-associated diseases.",

The results indicated that MCPyV required both K+ and Ca2+ channel activity, whilst SV40 trafficking was solely sensitive to Ca2+ channel blockage (Fig. 3).

Insensitivity to K+ channel inhibitors during SV40 infection (Fig. 4B) highlighted mechanistic differences between MCPyV and SV40.

Treatment with the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ channel inhibitor tetrandrine showed a concentration-dependent effect upon both viruses, with ablation of entry for MCPyV and SV40 at 5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas the L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor had no effect (Fig. 6A-D). As tetrandrine-mediated inhibition of EBOV entry was due to the prevention of ER docking, a viral uncoating assay for SV40 was performed as further validation (Fig. 7). Consistent with previous results, following treatment with 10 \u03bcM tetrandrine VP2/3 was undetectable, suggesting that virions either did not enter the ER or were unable to disassemble to reveal VP2/3 (summarised in Fig. 8\n), however it must be noted that they assay does not rule out the unlikely possibility that tetrandrine affects the rate on initial infection. Identification that PyVs share a conserved requirement with EBOV suggests that NAADP-sensitive TPC inhibition represents a therapeutic target for viruses and pathogens that transit through the ER. More recently a similar requirement of TPC2 and inhibitory effect of tetrandrine has been identified during entry of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Ou et al., 2020). Although tetrandrine is not widely available and there are currently limited studies into the efficacy of treatment in vivo, the identification of endosomal-ER fusion as a requirement for a variety of pathogens provides a common target that could potentially be exploited (Bhagya and Chandrashekar, 2018, 2016). Further studies using knock outs of specific ion channels, particularly the NAADP-sensitive TPCs 1 and 2, as well as transient Ca2+channels such as TRPML1 and TRPM2, will contribute to a better understanding of the roles that ion channels play during the entry of various PyVs.",

This study identifies that MCPyV is more sensitive to channel inhibition than SV40, with KV and T-type Ca2+ channel inhibition restricting entry which may be applicable to other humans PyVs. Additionally we have demonstrated that the NAADP-sensitive TPC inhibitor tetrandrine is a potent inhibitor of both MCPyV and SV40. Ca2+ channel modulation is therefore a potential mechanism through which human PyV diseases associated with persistent infection could be modulated. Coupled with previous studies, this requirement reveals a conserved target to restrict a wider range of pathogens that transit through the ER.",
