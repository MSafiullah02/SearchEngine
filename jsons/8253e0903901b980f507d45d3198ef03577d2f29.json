            "text": "ACE2 receptors serve as binding sites for the anchoring spike (S) proteins on the exterior surfaces of beta coronaviruses. 5 The beta coronavirus SARS-CoV causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The phylogenetically related beta coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, causes the novel coronavirus disease (nCoV-2019) or COVID-19. 5 S proteins anchor both beta coronaviruses to ACE2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract of infected patients in order to gain entry into the lungs. Viral pneumonia and potentially fatal respiratory failure may result in susceptible persons after 10-14 days. 5 Since patients treated with ACEIs and ARBS will have increased numbers of ACE2 receptors in their lungs for coronavirus S proteins to bind to, they may be at increased risk of severe disease outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs for cardiovascular diseases should avoid crowds, mass events, ocean cruises, prolonged air travel, and all persons with respiratory illnesses during the current COVID-19 outbreak in order to reduce their risks of infection. This warning is supported by a recent descriptive analysis of 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections treated in China during the reporting period, December 11, 2019, to January 29, 2020. 6 In this study, Guan et al reported more severe disease outcomes in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic renal disease ( Table 1) . 6 Severe outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. 6 All patients with the diagnoses noted met the recommended indications for treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. The results of this study demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 infections, and most likely treated with ACEIs or ARBs, suffered more severe disease outcomes. 6 Future case-control studies in patients with COVID-19 infections are recommended to further confirm chronic therapy with ACEIs or ARBs as a risk factor for more severe disease outcomes. In addition to elderly status with comorbidities, treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders with ACEIs or ARBs appears to be a risk factor for more severe disease outcomes including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death, in patients with COVID-19 infections. This conclusion is supported by the results a recent Chinese study of over 1,000 patients with COVID-19 infections that reported more severe disease outcomes in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic renal disease meeting all criteria for treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. 6 Table 1 .",

Two mechanisms may protect children from COVID-19 infections: (1) cross-protective antibodies from multiple upper respiratory tract infections caused by the common cold-causing alpha coronaviruses, and (2) fewer ACE2 receptors in their lower respiratory tracts to attract the binding S proteins of the beta coronaviruses. These immunological and molecular observations support the clinical observations of infrequent COVID-19 infections in children compared to more frequent COVID-19 infections in elderly patients, especially those with comorbid conditions.",
