The final result of 36 this hectic publication rhythm is to increase uncertainties rather than decreasing them as, on a given day, 37 there is an \"evidence\" for a treatment which is likely to be contradicted the day after. .

However, by keeping a similar trend, the questionable quality of the studies will jeopardize 69 the accuracy of future results and here we would go back to the original question (how can we trust this 70 literature?) and to the uncertainties where we come from.

This is not surprising considering that CFR is based on numbers that are 40 constantly evolving (e.g. number of reported cases, number of deaths, the risk period) and on variables that 41 are not always available or measurable (e.g. number of undetected cases, patient demographics and 42 characteristics, access to healthcare system, implementation of infection control strategies, testing policies 43 3 and selection bias) [4]. Exemplary is the report on CFR in Italy, which highlights how rates depend on the 44 prevalence of comorbidities and the average age of the population (which independently contribute to the 45 risk of death); variability in testing strategies (which affects the denominator); definition of COVID-19 related 46 deaths [5]. Nonetheless, these projections are used indiscriminately by the media to inform the public 47 without appropriate filters, thus fostering a feeling of unreliability, and to guide policy makers for designing 48 public health interventions in response to the emergency, with the risk of an inappropriate use of resources.",

The majority of the interventional trials is seeking to evaluate the efficacy of various 51 treatment regimens/combinations, from antiviral agents (e.g remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, 52 darunavir) to different immunomodulatory drugs (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, sarilumab, baricitinib, 53 ruxolitinb, anakinra, siltuzimab) or hyperimmune plasma. Nevertheless, we should question whether such 54 amount of studies is really essential. Having too many and partially overlapping options need to be carefully 55 weighted as it risks not only to undermine the trust in the coherence of trials development and registration 56 but also to make clinical decisions more difficult, lastly penalizing patient's care.",

It has already been underlined how RCTs 77 represent the study design that allow the enrolment of a representative sample of the population, provide 78 more reliable on drug efficacy and importantly ensure prompt identification of adverse events [8]. 79 Noteworthy, assurance of the integrity of trials development and drugs approval is prerogative of regulatory 80 agencies which should be the first to grant that tested treatments are effectively demanded to fill a real 81 knowledge gap of clinical and public health importance. In that respect, it might be advisable, especially in 82 time of crisis, to raise the bar for registration of clinical studies by clearly specifying a minimum of 83 methodological prerequisites to accomplish (e.g. consideration of the added value of the information that will 84 be produced to previous or contemporary evidence, definition of relevant outcome measures and effect-size, 85 transparent presentation of the results) and setting up rigorous criteria to assess the appropriateness of the 86 interventions [9]. It might be argued that this would disadvantage investigators and restrict the possibility of 87 conducting trials but, conversely, it would implement research quality, multicentre collaboration and of trials development is undoubtedly a positive response in this time of urgency, but the volume of 90 studies is not enough anymore. This time might be the opportunity to promote a research as a means 91 towards better rather than quantitative knowledge which is essential to preserve the integrity of scientific 92 community to the public and the trust in national and global health responses [10]. 93 Transparency declaration94The author declares no conflicts of interest.
