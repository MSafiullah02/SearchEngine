For example, based upon hospital administration data, with adjustment for risk factors, Hart et al. (2000) found an inverse association between strokes and categories of deprivation. Additionally, based upon panel data from the US Health and Retirement Study, Avendano and Glymour (2008) found that both wealth and income were significant contributory factors to incidences of stroke.",

Firstly, as compared to the outpatient data provided by the NHRI, which are sampling-based, the inpatient records are population-based; thus, the use of inpatient data can help to avoid potential issues of sampling bias. Secondly, we select inpatient care over outpatient care because the former has lower demand elasticity than the latter; thus, hospitalizations are more likely to reflect actual changes in health status (Manning, Newhouse, Duan, Keeler, & Leibowitz, 1987; Ruhm, 2003).",

The stock price index level measures the overall macroeconomic status and serves as a proxy of the wealth level. The daily percentage change in stock price index captures the wealth variation in the short run. Previous studies have shown that the stock investors are engaged in short-term trading in some emerging markets. Using a complete individual-level stock trading dataset of Taiwan, Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) find that day trading is prevalent in Taiwan \u2013 the percentage of day trade to all trades was 23.1% during their study period, 1995\u20131999. Moreover, they show that the average turnover in Taiwan Stock Exchange was 294% annually. In contrast, the annual turnover in the New York Stock Exchange was about 97%.

Firstly, the level effect of the stock market index on stroke hospitalizations is found to be significantly negative; that is, when the stock market index is at a low level, incidences of cerebrovascular disease are found to be relatively high. In general, a 1000 point fall in the TAIEX increases the number of daily stroke hospitalizations by 4.396. Secondly, daily movements in the stock price are also found to affect incidences of stroke. A fall of 1 per cent in the TAIEX within a single day increases daily hospitalizations for stroke by 1.582; this result is in line with the general view that a reduction in wealth is detrimental to health status. Thirdly, a fall in TAIEX within a day increases daily stroke hospitalizations in a quadratic way. A 2 per cent fall within a single day leads to an increase of approximately 4.32 in the number of hospitalizations due to stroke on that day.",

            "text": "This gives rise to the question of how stock market movements affect incidences of stroke. One possible answer is that a reduction in wealth can often lead to depression, a condition which is already documented as being a high risk factor for stroke (Glymour, Maselko, Gilman, Patton, & Avenda\u00f1o, 2010; Jonas & Mussolino, 2000). The level effect is found to be significant for both males and females whilst the daily change effects are found to be significant only for males. One potential reason for this significant daily change effect primarily affecting men is the fact that men participate in the stock market much more actively than women. Some researchers have also documented differences between men and women in terms of their attitude towards money; for example, Prince (1993) argued that men were more prone to feelings of greater competence in their management of finances and were therefore likely to take greater risks in order to amass wealth. From their analysis of survey and brokerage records, Lewellen, Lease, and Schlarbaum (1977) found that men spent more time and money on financial analysis, and also engaged in more transactions. Barber and Odean (2001) similarly examined a stock brokerage dataset, comprising of transactions by over 35,000 households, and found that men traded 45 per cent more than women. Thus, both the psychology and health status of men are more likely to be affected by daily stock market movements given that men engage far more actively in stock transactions than women.",
