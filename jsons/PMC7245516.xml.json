Over the past decade, a combination of advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanner technology and increased concern about the effects of ionizing radiation has led to increased utilization of MR imaging in the pediatric population. Despite this general trend, there has been slower adoption of MR imaging to evaluate the lungs and pleura due to technical limitations including motion artifact, low signal-to-noise ratios, and signal dephasing at air-tissue interfaces. As MR imaging technology advances, many of these technical hurdles are being overcome, and MR imaging of the lungs and pleura has begun to be a feasible option for evaluation of many pediatric pleuropulmonary conditions. Therefore, an up-to-date understanding of these emerging applications is important to practitioners performing MR imaging in infants and children.",

After infancy, nearly all children under 5 years of age are not able to hold still or adequately follow breathing instructions and therefore require moderate sedation or general anesthesia for successful MR imaging. Examinations performed under moderate sedation must utilize sequences that are optimized for quite free breathing. Examinations performed under general anesthesia may utilize sequences that require apnea. Children as young as 5 years of age may be candidates for MR imaging without sedation or anesthesia but must be carefully assessed prior to imaging to gauge their ability to cooperate for the examination. In order for an examination to be successful, preparation and coaching are essential prior to the MR imaging. Children must practice breathing maneuvers and become familiar with the scanner prior to the examination, ideally in a mock scanner environment with the assistance of child life specialists. During practice sessions, children learn to hold their breaths at end-inspiration and end-expiration, rapidly breathe in and out, and perform coughing maneuvers.",

            "text": "Historically, MR imaging of the lungs and pleura has been hampered by technical factors inherent to these organ systems including respiratory motion artifact, low signal-to-noise ratios, and signal dephasing at air-tissue interphases. However, in recent years, technological advances have helped to overcome many of these impediments, and diagnostic MR imaging of the lungs and pleura can now be achieved on MR imaging scanners currently in use at many medical centers. MR imaging protocols of the lungs and pleura mainly consist of spin-echo and gradient-echo sequences which can often produce image quality that approaches that of CT [2]. Newer techniques including ultra-short (UTE) or zero echo time (ZTE) sequences provide even better image quality which is on par with CT [3, 4]. When pediatric patients are unable to cooperate with breathing instructions, respiratory gating can be employed by utilizing a pneumobelt or navigator echo sequence [2]. Specialized sequences, which minimize motion artifact, can be used to obtain images during free breathing, including helicoidal (PROPELLER@GE) or radial (STARVIBE@SIEMENS) k-space acquisition schemes [5, 6]. MR imaging also has the ability to provide information about ventilation, inflammation, perfusion, and structure, under the acronym VIPS [7\u201310]. Table 1.1 provides an outline of MR imaging sequences commonly used to image the lungs and pleura [11].",

Intracellular surfactant is present within Type II pneumocytes in the canalicular phase at 20\u201324 weeks gestation and can be found within fetal lung fluid starting in the saccular phase [17]. Surfactant produced before 35 weeks gestation is present in smaller amounts and is more susceptible to inactivation than after 35 weeks [17, 18]. Surfactant allows alveoli to expand during inspiration by reducing surface tension [19, 20]. Surfactant is essential to lung function, and a major complication of pre-term birth is surfactant deficiency disorder (SDD). When a pre-term birth is imminent, pregnant mothers can be treated with glucocorticoids to speed up endogenous surfactant production by the fetus. After birth, exogenous surfactant may be administered via endotracheal tube to treat SDD.",

The second proposes a primary disruption of proximal bronchial bud development affecting only the proximal portion of the bronchus but not affecting the distal portion. In either case, the lung distal to the atretic bronchus does not communicate with the central airway. Pulmonary secretions are unable to pass through the atretic bronchus, and the bronchus distal to the atresia eventually fills with fluid, forming a bronchocele. The lung distal to the atretic bronchus becomes hyperinflated due to a check-valve mechanism or air drift via collateral pathways of aeration [28]. The air within the hyperinflated lung becomes deoxygenated, and the vascularity decreases due to hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction.",

Esophageal duplication cysts arise from the dorsal bud of the primitive foregut, and neurenteric cysts occur due to incomplete separation of the endoderm and notochord.

If not detected prenatally, bronchogenic and other foregut duplication cysts may be detected on chest radiograph as a mediastinal or pulmonary mass. Cross-sectional imaging is often performed to evaluate the finding of a mass. Although this is most typically achieved with CT, MR imaging is an excellent modality to characterize bronchogenic and other foregut duplication cysts. MR imaging typically demonstrates a cyst that is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and has variable intensity on T1-weighted images and does not enhance on contrast-enhanced images, except for a thin rim of wall enhancement [34]. Bronchogenic cysts within the mediastinum rarely communicate with the airway, but more peripheral cysts may communicate with the airway and contain an air-fluid level [39]. Bronchogenic cysts may become infected, especially when there is communication with the airway. When superinfected, cysts may develop a thick enhancing wall with irregular borders [40].",

Children may become infected by ingesting the eggs of the parasite located within feces of infected canids. After ingestion, the eggs hatch in the child\u2019s gastrointestinal tract and larvae enter the bloodstream. By hematogenous spread, larvae can then form cysts throughout the body; the two most common locations are the liver and the lung. Although most hydatid infections occur during childhood, the hydatid infection is often indolent, and affected patients may not present until adulthood [80]. Pulmonary hydatid disease is rare in many regions of the world, but, in endemic regions, it is a common differential diagnosis for a cystic lung lesion [81]. Hydatid cysts are composed of three layers (pericyst, laminated layer, and germinal layer) with membranes between them [82].",

If cyst communicates with the airway an \u201cair-crescent\u201d sign may be seen and a \u201cwater lilly\u201d sign may be seen when a collapsed endocyst floats within a cyst [85, 86]. MR imaging may help differentiate pulmonary hydatid disease from other cystic lung lesions by showing characteristic hypointense folded membrane within the cyst and a hypointense rim surrounding the cyst (see Fig. 1.22) [81]. Recent prospective study which compared MR and contrast-enhanced MDCT for evaluation of pediatric pulmonary hydatid disease showed that fast MR imaging without contrast material is comparable to contrast-enhanced MDCT for accurately diagnosing lung cysts in pediatric patients with pulmonary hydatid disease. However, added diagnostic value demonstrating internal membranes of cysts, which is specific to pulmonary hydatid disease, was provided by MR imaging in comparison to MDCT [87].",

Pulmonary necrosis evolves into pulmonary abscess when a wall forms around a region of devitalized lung (Fig. 1.25) [65, 89, 90]. On MR imaging, pulmonary necrosis is defined as an area of lung consolidation without enhancement on contrast-enhanced images. On T2-weighted images, necrosis may be appreciated as a region of lower signal centered within a higher-signal region of consolidation. Like on chest radiograph and CT, irregularly shaped locules of air may be seen within a region of pulmonary necrosis, and an air-filled cavity or a cavity with an air-fluid level may be seen in pulmonary abscess (see Fig. 1.25) [91].",

PBB and this hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome are associated with a mutation in the DICER1 gene [110]. There are three types of PPB: type I is purely cystic, type II is cystic and solid, and type III is completely solid. The median age at diagnosis for type I is 8 months, type II is 35 months, and type III is 41 months [111]. The MR imaging appearance depends on the type. In type III, masses are typically large and heterogeneous on T1- and T2-weighted images and often contain regions of necrosis which do not enhance on contrast-enhanced images (Fig. 1.28) [112].",

            "text": "As MR imaging has become the primary imaging modality to assess many diseases in pediatric patients, its role in the evaluation of the lungs and pleura has lagged due to technical challenges unique to the thorax. However, in recent years, new advances in scanner, computing, and sequence technology have allowed many of these challenges to be overcome. Diagnostic imaging of the lungs and pleura is currently a feasible option for many pediatric patients in many medical centers. As practitioners become familiar with these new techniques and appreciate its potential role, MR imaging will likely be used more in the future when evaluating the spectrum of congenital and acquired pediatric pulmonary and pleural disorders.",
