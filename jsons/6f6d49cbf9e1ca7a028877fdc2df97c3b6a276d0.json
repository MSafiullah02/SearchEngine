For negative test results in particular, failure to do so has direct implications for the safety of the public and healthcare workers and for the success of efforts to curb the pandemic. Specifically, anticipation of a less visible second wave of infection from individuals with false-negative test results is needed.",

Fundamental characteristics of clinical diagnostic tests for COVID-19 infection including sensitivity, specificity, and corresponding likelihood ratios are largely unknown. Sensitivity is particularly important in understanding the risk of false-negative testing. 4 The diagnostic sensitivity of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for other viruses is highly variable, but early data from China suggested relatively poor sensitivity of initial RT-PCR tests. 5 Even with sensitivity values as high as 90% the magnitude of risk from false-negative test results will be substantial as testing becomes more widespread and the prevalence of COVID-19 infection rises. 4 Why is this relevant to stopping the spread of COVID-19? False-negative results are consequential. Individuals with these results may relax physical distancing and other personal measures designed to reduce the transmission of the virus to others. In the case of clinicians, they may be sent to the frontlines of care and inadvertently transmit the virus to patients and colleagues, further straining the already precarious ability of the healthcare system to respond to the pandemic.",

Regardless of 5 the exact total, every one of these healthcare workers could spread disease despite the seeming reassurance of a negative COVID-19 test. At present, CDC guidelines for asymptomatic healthcare workers with negative COVID-19 testing are based on both the nature of clinical exposure to COVID-19 patients and personal symptoms, so that negative testing in an asymptomatic healthcare worker could lead to an immediate return to work for many engaged in routine clinical care. 6 Furthermore, restrictions on untested or test-negative asymptomatic healthcare workers with community exposures are limited or absent. To the extent that asymptomatic spread may contribute to disease transmission and serious illness, these policies could place colleagues and patients at ongoing risk.",

First, continued strict adherence to physical distancing, hand-washing, surface disinfection, and other preventive measures is required regardless of risk level, symptoms, or COVID-19 test result. In addition, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers may be necessary to protect these workers and their patients even when both have tested negative. This is problematic at present given PPE shortages, which will worsen as COVID-19 spreads unless production and distribution dramatically improve. Masks, eye shields, gowns, gloves, and other equipment must be available to prevent transfer of the virus to medical personnel so the risk of subsequent transmission is stopped before it can begin. Given concerns about the adequacy of cloth masks, 7 medical grade masks must be available for every healthcare worker, and consideration should be given to wearing masks in all clinical settings. 8 6 Second, there is an urgent need for development of highly sensitive and specific tests or combinations of tests to minimize the risk of false-negative results and ongoing transmission based on a false sense of security. Improved RT-PCR tests and serological assays are needed.",

However, for higher-risk individuals, even those without symptoms, the risk of false-negative test results necessitates continued measures to protect against spread of disease. For members of the public, this may mean extended self-isolation or quarantine. For healthcare workers in endemic areas, return to work after negative testing may need to be delayed until more sensitive tests 7 can be administered and repeat testing is negative, even without symptoms.
