From January through April and again from September through December 2010 (no samples were collected May-August), pediatric patients (up to age 20 years) presenting to the emergency department (ED) at CHM, a tertiary pediatric medical center in Detroit, Michigan, were offered participation in the study if the treating clinician had ordered any testing for viral respiratory pathogens. Some admitted patients had specimens collected in the hospital. The protocol required study patients to have one or more of the following signs or symptoms suggesting respiratory infection: fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, pain or pressure in ears, sinus pressure, and/or sneezing. The study coordinator confirmed with the treating clinician that the patient exhibited the recorded signs or symptoms before patient enrollment into the study.

Hemadsorption-positive cultures are tested with the fluorescent antibodies described above, potentially shortening the time to diagnosis. The remaining MRC-5 cell culture is incubated at 32\u00b0C.

This SVPCR array RP assay is rapid, takes 2 minutes of hands-on time/sample, and does not require special molecular training for the operator. This SVPCR array RP detected at least 1 pathogen in 344 (69%) of the 499 NP samples, whereas standard RAT and virus culture techniques detected only 99 (20% of the total and 29% of those with SVPCR array RP-detected pathogens). This rate is in the middle of the range of other studies using molecular methods for respiratory pathogen detection, which reported positive rates ranged from 46% to 93%.5, 15, 16, 17, 18 Based on SVPCR array RP results, there was a significant difference in the number of children 24 months and younger with a detected pathogen compared with those aged 25 months and greater. This difference may be related to the developing immune system of the younger age group, lack of previous virus exposure during early life, or to possible colonization.17 Those 25 months and older presenting with URI symptoms may have various other non-SVPCR array RP tested pathogens causing their symptoms. The FDA-cleared SVPCR array RP assay package insert reports 87.4% to 100% sensitivity and 94.6% to 100% specificity, based on pediatric and adult data (65% were children \u22645 years) obtained from the prospective clinical evaluation of the SVPCR array RP assay (excluding Bocavirus).19\n",

In contrast, B pertussis is thought not to cause prolonged NP colonization but may become undetectable, even by molecular techniques, shortly after the characteristic whoop develops. This suggests that positive results for B pertussis may indicate detection of a true pathogen, as was noted in 2 of our patients with coinfections. Heininger et al suggested that coinfections of viruses, such as RSV and hMpV, with Bordetella spp are rare.25 If viral coinfection does truly increase disease severity, it may be that multiple infections are over-represented in study samples from patients seeking evaluations in the ED and especially in those admitted to the hospital.

Many of these required combined contact and droplet isolation precautions. Therefore, our center has continued the use of combined isolation (contact and droplet) precautions for hospitalized children with URI symptoms year-round. This is maintained for all in-patients with URI symptoms for the duration of the illness or until hospital discharge. Patients placed in combined isolation are cohorted upon admission when private rooms are not available. Although cohorting of patients should be based on symptoms because of the range of pathogens we cannot culture and for which no rapid diagnostic tests exist, the full impact of rapid respiratory testing platforms, such as the SVPCR array RP, may allow for more focused isolation and cohorting of patients in the future and needs further study.",

Hospital epidemiologists at CHM track and report HAI rates for RSV, as detected by RAT or culture, during January through April for annual benchmarking. No other HAI respiratory viruses were routinely monitored. For the 3 years prior to initiation of combined droplet and contact isolation (2006-2008), the average RSV HAI rate per 1,000 patient days was 0.25 (16 RSV cases; unpublished data). During 2009 to 2011, after the implementation of combined isolation, the rate was 0.15 (9 RSV cases; unpublished data). This difference is not significant (P = .478). However, targeted infection control interventions, including specific viral testing, isolation precautions, and cohorting, have been reported to be associated with prevention of HAI and cost savings at other centers.4 The low number of influenza A strains detected may have reflected the timing of the influenza seasons. During the winter of 2009-2010, influenza peaked between October and December. During the winter of 2010-2011, almost all the influenza occurred during January through March. Thus, little influenza was detected by any methodology during our study periods.",

As noted above, with most respiratory molecular diagnostic sample testing including this study and others, there is a possibility of PCR tests from respiratory samples yielding positive results that may be due to dead virion detection as opposed to active viral replication.",

However, those same patients often had negative RAT and viral culture results because of limitations in sensitivity and in inherent detection capabilities of these assays. Nearly 70% of our patients with URI symptoms (73% of those aged \u226424 months) had positive SVPCR array RP results for at least 1 pathogen. Coinfection was present in 11% of all tested and 17% of those testing positive for at least 1 pathogen. Because of the pathogens and pathogen combinations detected in 11% of all participants tested, our study findings suggest that combined contact and droplet isolation precautions (gown, gloves, and mask) may be warranted to prevent HAI in pediatric inpatients with URI. Further studies will be needed to confirm these findings and to assess the effect of combined isolation precautions on prevention of HAI in pediatric hospitals.",
