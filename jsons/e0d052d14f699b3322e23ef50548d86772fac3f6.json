Recently, gastrointestinal shedding of viral RNA detected in fecal samples has been reported in both children and adults [1, 2] . This may be unsurprising given the high expression of viral host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in gastrointestinal tract [3] . In a clinical study of 138 COVID-19 patients, Wang et al. reported that 10% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms 1-2 days prior the onset of fever and dyspnea [4] . Therefore, we aim here to explore whether or not patients presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, or diarrhea may be at increased odds of the severe form of COVID-19.",

Title, abstract, and of all full text of all identified items were analyzed, and those providing the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in adult (> 18 years of age) COVID-19 patients with clinically validated definition of \"severe disease\" (i.e., patients needing mechanical ventilation, vital life support, and intensive care unit admission) were included in a pooled analysis. No exclusion criteria were applied. The reference list of all retrieved documents was also hand-searched (through forward and backward citation tracking) for identifying additional eligible studies. Articles in Chinese were screened by a healthcare professional fluent in both Chinese and English. When data describing gastrointestinal symptoms were identified, the article was translated into English to enable data collection. As the data set was limited and included case series, no study risk of bias or publication bias assessment was performed.",

We hypothesize that abdominal pain may be related to the degree of viral replication in the gut, with increased severity of illness observed related to a high viral load and subsequent viremia. We suggest that abdominal pain may be used as clinical predictor of more severe disease and be included in future risk stratification algorithms.",
