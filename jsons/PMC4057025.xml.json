In light of observational and randomized trials in support of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), this approach has been advocated for and employed in several cases of complicated H1N1 infection [2]. The premises for use of ECMO in these patients, including ECMO-supported inter-hospital transfer, have been mainly the young age, the relatively low prevalence of comorbidities, and the likelihood for reversible lung failure typical of these patients [3]. Yet, there is uncertainty as to the risk-benefit balance of ECMO in patients with H1N1 infection, given variability in selection, procedural and logistic features involved in the implementation of such a technically demanding treatment [4].",

Furthermore, the exclusion of more than 70 reports because including less than 10 cases clearly calls for more collaborative research efforts. This type of collaboration is essential for present and future clinical challenges resembling the H1N1 pandemic. If only a fraction of these separate case series were to be combined, we would have achieved much greater statistical power and precision. In addition, we did not formally appraise agreement between reviewers before final consensus for study search, selection, abstraction or appraisal. Finally, no cases of H1N1 outbreaks have been reported recently, and thus the main strength of the present work is to prove that the experience with ECMO for ALI due to H1N1 infection, given its favorable effects on younger and previously healthier patients, may be helpful in the future in similar situations.",
