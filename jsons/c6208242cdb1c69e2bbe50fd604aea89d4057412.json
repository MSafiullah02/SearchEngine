Let us consider the kind of particles called \"fermions\" and specifically the electrons which have a spin equal to 1/2. A collection of electrons obeys Fermi statistics and thus behaves according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle: No two electrons with the same values of their four quantum numbers can occupy simultaneously the same quantum state of a polyelectronic atom. The principle describes the fact that electrons in atoms cannot spiral down into the nucleus, but instead they form a series of shells which surround the nucleus, giving atoms their distinct structure. The number of electrons in the outermost atomic shell produces the chemical valence, which in turn binds atoms into molecules. The properties of the system of these outermost electrons define the kind of atoms and molecules that can exist and thus the kind of materials found in nature. 16 The Pauli Exclusion Principle applies to systems of particles and has little meaning for individual particles.

The thermodynamic behavior of this system of particles obeys Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and the concepts of gas temperature and gas pressure define experimentally measurable macroscopic properties of the gas (the air). While the macroscopic properties temperature and pressure of the gas are related to the microscopic motions of the individual molecules making up the gas, they are meaningless for the isolated gas molecules; they are new, emergent properties of the whole collection of molecules making up the gas.

Molecular structure is more complex than the atomic. For instance, the hydrogen molecule (H 2 ) is formed when two hydrogen atoms come close enough together that the orbits of their electrons overlap and the probability of the two electrons being in the same space between the two hydrogen atoms of the hydrogen molecule is large. For these conditions to be satisfied, the electron of the one H atom must be moving in the opposite direction than the electron of the other H atom, that is, the spins of the electrons of the two H atoms must be anti-parallel. Only then the probability of finding simultaneously the two electrons between the two H atoms is large and the negative charge of the two electrons between the two nuclei attracts them together, and a bond between the two H atoms is established. In the opposite case, where the spins of the two electrons of the two H atoms are parallel, the electrons cannot be simultaneously between the two nuclei, the force between the nuclei is repulsive, and the H 2 molecule is not formed.

The chemical and physical behavior of the water molecule is determined by its quantum mechanical structure, which itself is dependent on the electronic structure of its constituent atoms H and O. The water molecule has physical and chemical properties of its own, for instance, an electric dipole moment. In turn, the electric dipole moment and the stereo-chemical structure of the water molecule crucially determine its interactions with other molecules. Water molecules make \"hydrogen bonds\" with other water molecules (hydrogen-bonded structures), transient clusters comprised of specific numbers of water molecules, complexes around positive ions, around negative ions or around electrons (forming \"hydrated\" electrons), and so on. 17 If a few trillion trillion water molecules are put in a glass, the whole assembly of the water molecules, the liquid, acquires a new property, fluidity, that none of the water molecules has. Fluidity, wrote Phillip Anderson in an article with the title \"More is Different\", is an emergent property of liquid water. 18 If, now, liquid water is heated up to 100\u00b0C, the same molecules evaporate and the system makes a phase transition to water vapor. If, conversely, liquid water is cooled down to 0\u00b0C, the system abruptly undergoes another phase transition, the water molecules stop their chaotic motion and form an ordered hexagonal crystal structure known as ice. These forms of matter are emergent; they have no meaning for the isolated water molecules. The transition from the liquid state of matter to the crystalline forms of matter is normally associated with two important emergent properties: order and organization. 19 Many other similar examples can of course be given and indeed one can extend this type of discussion even to our Galaxy and the entire universe.

There is a need to develop ways for \"Science for Policy\" activities, which will make possible the input of scientific evidence into the decision-making process and aid the resolution of social issues, claims and conflicts. Such an engagement of the scientist requires deep knowledge of the specific scientific issue and a holistic rather than a reductionist approach in translating scientific evidence into public policy; accountability in public policy, many have said, requires scientific evidence to be correctly embedded into the democratic process. The most important criteria for a scientist's contribution in this capacity are scientific competence, integrity, independence and transparency. These are basic prerequisites for an impartial assessment of the facts of science pertaining to the issue at hand worthy of the trust of society. To examine the impacts of policy decisions and to help mitigate their risks it is necessary to base such decisions both on science and on the values of society, to situate scientific evidence in the context of society's value system, and political judgments to be evidence-based.

And there are still science and technology relevant issues which may transcend the technical knowledge needed to provide a complete resolution of the issue, but scientific advice is nonetheless sought to help the decision-making process even before a complete scientific understanding is reached. For instance, the possible effects of electromagnetic radiation on human health; although several major studies 79, 80 have found that the use of mobile phones and exposure to radiation from high-voltage transmission lines does not pose any health risks, public concern about radiation from mobile phones and high-voltage transmission lines continues. \u2022 Delineate proposed claims for or against a given issue. Invariably, risks arise when businesses or interest groups interpret scientific facts beyond the truth they contain. Often even honest science is mistrusted because of where it gets its funding. It is argued as well that even in countries where free speech is the norm, institutions are not always as open as necessary to dissenting voices. Impact assessments prepared to accompany policy proposals may, for example, be deliberately limited in the options they considered and in the sources of data they used, with the aim of achieving a desired outcome. Lack of openness in evidence gathering oftentimes has resulted in impact assessments being focused more on risks than on opportunities, in being more cautionary. \u2022 Choose wisely the mechanisms from which advice is gotten. Today, it seems everyone wants to have scientific advice (especially the government) and everyone wants to give scientific advice, foremost to the government! Thus, debates over structures and procedures necessary for sound scientific advice abound. 81 offering \"independent\" and \"competent\" scientific advice to governments and national and international organizations, \"which often moderates extreme views on key issues and balances advocacy\". National, regional, and global Science Advice Mechanisms are necessary for expert, competent and conditionally-and-contextually-independent advice. \u2022 Delineate the role of the scientist as a policy advisor and as an advocate. The views of scientists (whether acting alone or as members of academies/organizations/committees) are respected because they are supposed to be objective and independent experts in the field advice is sought, but when they act as advocates they are likely to be in conflict with the professional norms of science. Advocacy by the scientists themselves on behalf of any issue be it the environment, global warming, shale gas extraction, GMFs, stem cells, or synthetic biology, may be a real or perceived attempt to affect the opinions of the general public or certain groups of population, or the decision making of politicians, legislators and governments. It is obviously not just risky but unfair to assume that when scientists become advocates they become partisans and are no longer \"neutral conveyors of scientific information\". Yet, scientific advice almost always contains shades of opinion not entirely scientific, and the goals and methods of advocacy can be in conflict with the goals and methods of science. It is not uncommon to find the experts whose advice is sought to be the ones with vested interests in the subject they are called upon to give advice. Thus, the advice should be sought more broadly and should include competent people from outside the subject matter concerned. Does everything that scientists say or advocate have the backing of science and is self-regulation of scientists adequate to handle the pressures placed upon their scientific integrity?
