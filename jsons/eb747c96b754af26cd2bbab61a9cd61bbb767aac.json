In addition, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the RAAS can complicate DKA management. Excessive fluid resuscitation may potentiate acute respiratory distress syndrome as angiotensin II increases pulmonary vascular permeability and worsens damage to lung parenchyma 5 . Furthermore, angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion, potentiating the risk of hypokalemia, which may necessitate more potassium supplementation in order to continue intravenous insulin to suppress ketogenesis.",

The interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) might provide another mechanism in the pathophysiology of DKA.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key enzyme in the RAAS, catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) 1 . ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs, pancreas and serves as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 1 . After endocytosis of the virus complex, ACE2 expression is downregulated 2 . There are 2 implications of these interactions. Firstly, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into pancreatic islet cells may directly aggravate beta cell injury 3 . Secondly, downregulation of ACE2 after viral entry can lead to unopposed angiotensin II, which may impede insulin secretion 4 .5These 2 factors might have contributed to the acute worsening of pancreatic beta cell function and precipitated DKA in this patient.",
