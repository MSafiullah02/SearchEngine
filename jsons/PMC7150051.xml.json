            "text": "The transmission cycle of arboviruses is considered complex due to the necessary interaction between the hosts and the vectors of the disease. The basic transmission cycle of arboviruses is through an adult mosquito that feeds on an infected host. The mosquito then transports the infective viral particles in their salivary glands and then, in a secondary feeding, transmits the virus to another susceptible host. For viral transmission to be successful, a competent vector is necessary. The competent vector is the ability of an insect to receive, transport, and transmit virus from one host to another. There are many factors that affect vector competition, such as temperature (Dohm et al., 2002), population dynamics (Sardelis et al., 2001, Baqar et al., 1993), and the concentration of viral particles in the blood (Komar et al., 1999, Chamberlain, 1958). The interaction between a vector and a host is an important element to determine vector capacity. The vector capacity is determined by the density of vectors, the competition of the vector species, the ability to successfully feed on a viremic host, the incubation time necessary for an infectious vector to infect another host, and the survival rate (Unnasch et al., 2007). The competences of arbovirus vectors differ from each other and are based on geographic locations and virus strains. This interaction between vectors, reservoirs, and hosts is what contributes to the existence and maintenance of arboviruses.",

Although in the Americas, the jungle cycle for DENV has not been verified, in a tropical forest in northeastern Brazil, an amplicon of DENV-1 was detected in a Haemagogus leucocelaenus and DENV-3 infecting larvae of Aedes albopictus with transovarian transmission. This suggests that this virus could be involved in a sylvatic cycle (De Figueiredo et al., 2010). Haemagogus have food and flight adaptability; in certain scenarios, they can fly at ground level by stinging humans and wild animals when they enter their ecological niche (Maestre et al., 2008, Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2010), they can not only fly in open areas, distances between 250 and 350 m, but also distances close to 11 km, and in extreme conditions they can even fly 50 km or more in search of food (Forshey et al., 2010, Moraes, 2007). Some studies have reported that the collection of these species in the vicinity of rural dwellings adjacent to forest areas (Maestre et al., 2008, Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2010) increases the probability of contact with humans and domestic animals (Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2010) (Fig. 6.1\n).",

The survival of A. aegypti and A. albopictus is highly dependent on temperature and water availability (Luz et al., 2008). The greenery index of vegetation canopy can be used as a substitute to indirectly know soil moisture at the surface level. The coverings of vegetation near ground level have been used to associate them with the larval development capacity in these sites (Estallo et al., 2008, Nihei et al., 2014). Eggs and adults require moisture to survive in the dry season; drought levels affect adult mortality (Sota and Mogi, 1992, Russell et al., 2001). The protection of vegetation acts as a cover reduces evaporation and wind speed in the secondary canopy, which protects the development of the mosquito in those places (Linthicum, 1999, Fuller et al., 2009, Hahn et al., 2014).",

In Brazil, about 36 arboviruses have been associated with the human disease, some even causing serious conditions that can lead to death (Vasconcelos et al., 1992, Pinheiro, et al., 1997, Vasconcelos et al., 2001, Vasconcelos et al., 1992). Of these, five are of great importance in terms of public health, as they are associated with epidemics, which are DENV, OROV (Bunyaviridae family), MAYV (Togaviridae family), Rocio virus, and YFV. DENVs and Rocio virus are associated with epidemics in urban areas, while MAYV and YFV are associated with human disease in wild areas (Vasconcelos et al., 1984). In Rio Grande do Sul, 55 mosquitoes species were identified, of which 22 were registered for the first time and the main arboviruses that circulate in the neotropical region belong to the Flavivirus genus such as SLEV, YFV, and Ilh\u00e9us virus among other arboviruses (Cardoso et al., 2010).\n",

The doctor of patient 2 reported that another girl (patient 3), a close friend of patient 2, showed clinical symptoms compatible with CHIKV infection; patient 3 lived near patient 1 and on September 15, she was invited by patient 2 to her home; the two girls presented with numerous mosquito bites and the serum sample of patient 3 had high specific anti-CHIKV IgM titers and a weak signal by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Given that patients 2 and 3 did not report any recent travel to endemic areas of CHIKV; their clinical episodes were classified as autochthonous cases of CHIKV infection. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these viral strains belong to a group that is closely related to the strains of India; the CHIKV isolate of patient 2 could be derived from an Indian strain introduced by patient 1 (Grandadam et al., 2011). Likewise, in 2010 coinfections with DENV and CHIKV occurred in this region (La Ruche et al., 2010).",

In the year 2016 in Cordoba (Colombia), by means of RT-PCR-nested the flavivirus circulation was confirmed: DENV-2 in A. aegypti, YFV in Haemagogus splendens, SLEV in Mansonia titillans, Culex spp., and WNV in Culex spp. (Hoyos-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016). It is also known that Culex quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti, A. Vexans, and A. albopictus bite humans and bats (Kimpel and Mehlhorm, 2013). In addition, there are different serological or molecular evidences on DENV in wild bats, in brains and bat sera in Hainan, China (Zhang et al., 1998), antibodies DENV-1, -2, and -3 in Costa Rica and Ecuador (Platt et al., 2000), and antibodies against flaviviruses in Glossophaga soricina, Artibeus jamaicensis, and Artibeus lituratus in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (Machain et al., 2013). The same serotype was evidenced in intestines and in blood, and phylogenetic analyses showed a spillover effect of humans toward bats in Costa Rica (Vicente-Santos et al., 2017). No molecular evidence was detected in liver, spleen, and serology in wild bats from Campeche and Morelos (Mexico); what has suggested that probably in America, bats are not amplifiers of DENV, and isolation studies should be implemented to determine their role as reservoirs of DENV (Cabrera-Romo et al., 2016).

They are transmitted mainly by arthropods (arboviruses) and also by a wide variety of small mammals and birds. Viruses belonging to this genus are classified as new or old world, depending on the geographical location from which they were originally isolated (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). New world alphaviruses include EEEV, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and WEEV, which cause encephalitis in humans and other mammals, while old world alphaviruses, such as CHIKV, o'nyong-nyong virus (VONN), Ross River virus (VRR), Semliki Forest virus, and Sindbis virus (SINV), cause fever, rash, and arthralgia; this syndrome rarely causes mortality (Ryman and Klimstra, 2008). In South America the MAYV is considered arthrogenic. The reemergence of CHIKV reiterates the potential threat posed by alphaviruses to human health, and the need to understand mechanisms involved in their biology (Simon et al., 2006, Ferro et al., 2015). Many of these viruses circulate permanently in an enzootic cycle that involves wild animals that live in nearby environments where anthropic activities take place. Tropical alphaviruses have special tropism for osteoarticular tissue, patients develop chronic rheumatologic conditions similar to rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. The example is the CHIKV, although other viruses less known in our environment, such as Sindbis, VRR, MAYV, VONN, and Barmah Forest, have a potential to spread through vectors and cause chronic rheumatological disorders. With the exception of the Eilat alphavirus whose range of hosts is restricted to insects only (Hermanns et al., 2017) (Fig. 6.3\n).",

However, outbreaks have also been reported in large cities. The disease caused by MAYV takes 3\u20135 days and includes fever, headache, myalgia, rash, and arthralgia of large joints, and occasionally, arthritis; the convalescence of this disease could require several weeks. MAYV remains in the wild as a zoonosis of primates that are infected by the bite of Haemagogus mosquitoes that live in the canopies. A study of 335 blood samples from indigenous communities in the Rio Negro region, Brazil, indicated that 41.5% had antibodies against MAYV, which shows that it is a common infection in this region. During 2007, cases of Mayaro fever have also been presented in large cities such as Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas. In that city, IgM antibodies against MAYV were detected by immunoassay in the serum of 33 patients, the MAYV genome was identified in one of these sera. The patients had fever, headache, arthralgia, eye pain, and rash. Evidence of the migration of MAYV to other parts of Brazil has also been reported. In 2000 three patients who had Mayaro fever and most likely acquired it in the city of Camapu\u00e3, located in the center-west of the country, traveled to the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, where they were diagnosed. Therefore MAYV is an emerging virus that affects humans, including individuals who live in the large cities of the Amazon region. This virus could spread to other regions of Brazil, as well as other tropical countries of America, as it is introduced by sick travelers or migratory birds. MAYV and CHIKV could also be transmitted by A. aegypti. This background makes it possible to imagine a future scenario in which MAYV, after adapting to the urban cycle, could be the cause of major epidemics (Garcia and Moraes, 2014).\n",

A study conducted on domestic herbivorous animals in the Brazilian Amazon demonstrated susceptibility to alphaviruses using antibodies to inhibit hemagglutinins. Prevalences by animal species indicated that there were significant differences between horses and water buffaloes and between cattle and sheep. Horses showed high prevalence of antibodies in cross-reactions between four alphavirus antibodies used.

This control strategy for mosquito-borne arboviruses, which do not normally have specific antiviral therapies available, is important because the resources used are typically biodegradable and ecological. During the last decade the advance of molecular biology has allowed the optimization of genetic materials associated with biological control agents. A significant advance has been the discovery of the cytoplasmic incompatibility induced by the Wolbachia bacterium, which has improved replacement programs and the introduction of dominant lethal genes into local mosquito populations by releasing genetically modified mosquitoes (Huang et al., 2017).",

The relationship between the emergence of infectious diseases and the climatic variations associated with human behavior and that of vectors is also important; this demonstrates the need to address public health problems from complex and multidisciplinary perspectives.",
