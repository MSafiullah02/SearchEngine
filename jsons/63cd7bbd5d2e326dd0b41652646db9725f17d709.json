Early epidemiological analyses show that compared to the seasonal flu, COVID-19 patients may require ventilation much more frequently [1] . This can lead to a shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources, resulting in limited medical care and death [2] . Whereas some countries have been exposed very early [3] , others had the opportunity to prepare for the ethical challenges that emerge when intensive care resources become scarce.",

In crisis situations, such as pandemics, this practice is superimposed by an additional triaging process. Medical factors of triage recommendations typically contain exclusion criteria, a mortality assessment (e.g., Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and a reevaluation requirement [2] . Beyond the medical aspects, however, triaging unavoidably involves moral choices. The main ethical considerations for making such choices concern equity and maximizing benefits [5, 6] . Other criteria such as considering life stages, rewarding prosocial behavior, or giving priority to the worst off have been subject to long-standing controversy [5, 7, 8] .",

However, no guideline argues in favor of a lottery or a \"first come, first served\" approach. Rather, prognosisassessed in accordance with current intensive care standards-is seen as an indispensable precondition for maximizing benefit. There is some difference between the guidelines as to the role of short-term vs. long-term survival. Whereas some guidelines (CH, A) refer to shortterm survival only as a key triaging criterion, others either do not specify survival (UK, BE) or explicitly allow for the possibility that long-term prognosis (G) or a reduced lifespan, due to old age or to comorbidities, could affect a patient's access to a ventilator (I). In Switzerland, an age limit is rejected as a criterion in itself, yet an age of over 85 years is mentioned as an exclusion criterion to admission to the ICU if no free beds are available.",

No preferential treatment for specific subgroups is advocated, except for health staff (CH) with a view to maintaining the workforce. Rather, fair decision-making processes are emphasized as well as good palliative care (I, CH, A, G, BE). Most guidelines (CH, A, G, BE) call in their statements for interprofessional teams to make and document triage decisions fairly and transparently; others (I) require a second opinion in case of uncertainty. All guidelines demand regular re-evaluation of the decisions taken. In recognition of the moral stress that taking these decisions may bring on, all guidelines call for psychosocial support for health professionals.",

Respect for the patient's will, fair distribution, and maximization of benefits based on chance of survival are at the heart of the recently issued triaging guidelines. There is some disagreement as to whether only short-term survival should be considered or if more long-term considerations-life expectancy, possibly in combination with quality of life-should have a place as well. Age limits or the exclusion of other patient groups with reduced long-term survival may be very sensitive from a political and psychological point of view. It might be preferable to strengthen advance care planning, assuming that a significant number of patients with a high likelihood of poor outcomes would not opt for intensive care if other choices, such as good palliative care, were readily available to them. Guidelines have the potential to reduce the burden on those who need to determine which patient gets access to a scarce resource. To the extent that it is unavoidable that physicians \"have to decide who must die and whom (they) shall keep alive\" [3] , this should not happen without clear criteria that result from a consensus process of professional associations, a team approach to decisionmaking, and the offer of psychological support [9] . It will be of interest to see if artificial intelligence can play an assistive role in such situations [15] .",
