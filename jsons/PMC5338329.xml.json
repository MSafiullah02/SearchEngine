            "text": "To study the role of endogenous IL-6 in host defense against influenza, we compared the body weight change and survival curves, as well as histological and immunological changes between IL-6-deficient (IL-6\u2212/\u2212) and WT C57BL/6 mice after intranasal infection of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus (IAV). As shown in Fig. 1a, four out of nine IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice continued to lose weight and died between 6 and 10 days after infection (middle panel), whereas only one out of 16 WT mice lost weight without weight gain and died at day 10 post-infection (p.i.) (left panel). All of the mice that survived for more than 10 days recovered and survived for at least 16 days. Analysis of the entire body weight curves of the infected mice from day 0 through day 6 while all the mice were still alive reveals that IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice lost more weight over time on average than WT mice (right panel). Figure 1b shows that deficiency in IL-6 increased the mortality and reduced the survival time in mice after IAV infection. As shown in Fig. 1c, histological examination of the lungs collected at day 6 p.i. revealed that IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice had higher levels of mononuclear cell accumulation (middle panel) and higher histologic scores (right panel) than WT mice (left and right panels). In the broncoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, IL-6 contents were undetectable (left panel) as expected, whereas levels of TGF-\u03b2 were higher (right panel) in IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT mice (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly higher viral loads than WT mice in the BAL fluid at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1e). Taken together, these results suggest that IL-6 may be involved in the protection against influenza.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is a common complication of influenza with diffuse alveolar damage, fibroblast proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration22. In some cases, pneumonia finally causes fibrosis accompanied with collagen or ECM deposition and EMT. We therefore compared the levels of fibroblasts, fibronectin, collagen, MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the lungs of IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice infected with IAV. IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice had higher amounts of fibroblasts at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2a) and expressed higher levels of fibronectin at day 10 p.i. (Fig. 2b) than WT mice. However, the amount of fibronectin expressed in lung fibroblasts did not significantly differ between IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice, as examined by immunofluorescence staining (Supplementary Figure S1a). TGF-\u03b2 can induce \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression, which is relevant to fibrosis formation. Given elevated expression of TGF-\u03b2 in the BAL fluid of the infected IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1d), we further detected the typical EMT marker \u03b1-SMA to assess the potential involvement of IL-6 in the regulation of EMT during influenza infection. We found that expression of \u03b1-SMA was similar between WT and IL-6\u2212/\u2212 lungs exhibiting either minor or severe fibroblast accumulation (Supplementary Figure S1b). Moreover, contents of lung fibroblasts did not differ between IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice (Supplementary Figure S1c). To determine whether fibrosis occurred in the mice at a later stage of influenza, collagen deposition in the lung was assessed by picrosirius red staining. IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice expressed higher levels of collagen in the lung than WT mice detected at day 15 (Fig. 2c) and day 28 (Fig. 2d) p.i. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) represent a group of enzymes involved in the degradation of ECM components. We further detected MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the BAL fluid by gelatin zymography. IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice expressed lower levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 compared to WT mice (Fig. 2e), suggesting that deficiency in IL-6 may disturb the degradation and turnover of ECM. Furthermore, the wet-to-dry (wet/dry) ratios of the lungs increased by approximately two-fold in IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 2f), suggesting that deficiency in IL-6 may lead to severe edema and lung injury. Collectively, these results implicate a protective role for IL-6 in influenza infection by reducing fibroblast accumulation and enhancing ECM turnover in the lung.",

            "text": "To further dissect the effect of IL-6 on fibroblast functions, fibroblasts were isolated from the lungs of IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice and cultured for 72 h. Cell numbers were counted every 24 h using the Celigo cytometer (Cyntellect, San Diego, CA). Increased cell proliferation (Fig. 3a) and decreased doubling time (Fig. 3b) were noted in IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts compared with those in WT cells. Notably, IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT lung fibroblasts were equally susceptible to infection by IAV, as assessed by detection of viral nucleoprotein (NP) (Fig. 3c) and quantification of its expression (Fig. 3d). To determine the migratory capability of lung fibroblasts, we used the conditioned medium from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 or WT fibroblasts that had been infected with IAV as the chemoattractant. As shown in Fig. 3e, fibroblasts from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice had a higher migratory capability than those from WT mice in response to the conditioned medium of either WT or IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts infected with IAV, as determined by the Boyden chamber assay. Notably, IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts in response to the conditioned medium from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts had the highest migratory ability among the four treatment conditions. These results indicate that IL-6\u2212/\u2212 lung fibroblasts were more prone to be stimulated to migrate following influenza infection, and that the infected IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts secreted more chemoattractant proteins capable of stimulating fibroblast migration, as compared with their WT counterparts. Given that IAV-infected IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice produced higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 in the BAL fluid (Fig. 1d) and their lung fibroblasts displayed higher migratory capability in vitro (Fig. 3e) compared with their WT counterparts, we further examined TGF-\u03b2 levels in the supernatants of IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT fibroblasts with or without infection with IAV. Figure 3f shows that uninfected IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts secreted higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 than their WT counterparts. Notably, levels of TGF-\u03b2 were further increased when IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts were infected with IAV, whereas their contents remained similar in WT fibroblasts regardless of viral infection. These results suggest that deficiency in IL-6 may lead to increases in the migratory capability of lung fibroblasts probably through the elevated production of TGF-\u03b2.",

To further study whether IL-6 regulated fibroblast survival, we infected lung fibroblasts with IAV and measured the apoptosis of fibroblasts by detection of the cleaved caspase-3. Figure 3g shows that there was a slight reduction in the percentage of cleaved caspase-3 in the infected IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts in comparison to their WT counterparts. However, in the absence of viral infection, the levels of cleaved caspase-3 were not significantly different between IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT fibroblasts. To evaluate the importance of IL-6 in apoptosis, we treated IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts with different doses of recombinant mouse IL-6 and determined their apoptosis. Treatment with IL-6 enhanced the apoptotic potential of IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts following IAV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3h) with concomitant decreases in TGF-\u03b2 production (Fig. 3i). Taken together, lacking of IL-6 rendered lung fibroblasts more resistant to virus-induced apoptosis. Thus, IL-6 may be indispensable for reducing fibroblast proliferation, migration and survival through decreasing TGF-\u03b2 production.",

            "text": "Inappropriate activation of epithelial cells and neutrophil apoptosis can lead to tissue injury and diseases, such as ALI and ARDS24. As alveolar type II (AT2) cells can differentiate into alveolar type I (AT1) cells for regeneration of damaged lung tissue, AT2 cells are crucial for reducing epithelial cell apoptosis and promoting lung repair. We thus examined whether IL-6 could protect epithelial cells from IAV-induced death. Lung sections obtained from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice at day 7 p.i. were double-stained with antibody against the AT2 cell marker surfactant protein C (SP-C) (red) and TUNEL (green). TUNEL-SP-C doubly stained cells were evident in the IL-6\u2212/\u2212 lungs, whereas AT2 cells undergoing apoptosis were hardly detectable in the WT lungs (Fig. 4a). Moreover, the numbers of double-positive cells were approximately doubled in the lungs of IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with those of WT mice (Fig. 4b). We further used human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) to assess whether IL-6 reduced IAV-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. Addition of IL-6 decreased the percentage of cleaved caspase-3 in IAV-infected BEAS-2B and MLE-12 cells (Fig. 4c) in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking of IL-6 activity with anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody in MLE-12 cells infected with IAV increased TGF-\u03b2 production in the culture medium (Fig. 4d). Taken together, these results indicate that in addition to promoting fibroblast apoptosis, IL-6 improves epithelial cell survival with concomitant inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 production.",

Given that peritoneal macrophages were much more susceptible to productive IAV infection than BMDMs, we used peritoneal macrophages for further studies. Notably, numbers of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages isolated from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice were reduced by 75% compared with those from WT mice (Fig. 5f). Furthermore, lack of IL-6 hampered the migratory response of these macrophages toward fetal bovine serum (FBS) that served as the chemoattractant (Fig. 5g). To investigate whether IL-6 provided survival signals to macrophages, peritoneal macrophages were infected with or without IAV for 48 h, and cell death was analyzed by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Compared with WT macrophages, more cell death occurred in IL-6\u2212/\u2212 macrophages in the absence of IAV infection, which were further increased after viral infection (Fig. 5h). Collectively, these results suggest that presence of IL-6 may promote the migration and recruitment of macrophages to the lung and reduce their death during influenza infection.",

To investigate whether IL-6 impacted macrophage phagocytosis, we examined phagocytosis of viral particles and dead infected cells by macrophages from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice. Flow cytometric analysis shows that FITC-labeled IAV particles were more efficiently ingested by the peritoneal macrophages isolated from WT mice than from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, similar results were observed when QD649 quantum dots were used for assessing the phagocytic activity of macrophages (Fig. 6b). To mimic real virus-induced cell death, we infected MDCK cells with IAV for 24 h, and then mixed these infected cells with macrophages from IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice at a ratio of 2 : 1 for 2 h. Figure 6c shows that more virus-infected cells were engulfed by WT macrophages than by IL-6\u2212/\u2212 macrophages, as observed by fluorescence microscopy and quantified by the Celigo cytometer. Taken together, these results suggest that deficiency in IL-6 may impair phagocytic clearance of influenza virus and virus-infected cells by macrophages.",

Fibroblasts are involved in the proliferation and remodeling phases. The roles of TGF-\u03b2 in the interplay between fibroblasts and epithelial cells have been studied in much detail. TGF-\u03b2 has a contrast role in epithelial cells. It induces apoptosis in bronchiolar epithelial cells and diminishes lung epithelial regeneration26. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 promotes epithelial cells undergoing EMT to become myofibroblasts27.Targeting TGF-\u03b2 activity and its downstream signaling pathways effectively attenuates fibrosis formation2829. Previous studies have indicated that IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 participate in the pathogenesis of lung diseases, such as ARDS30, lung fibrosis, asthma31 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease32. Influenza virus induces activation of latent TGF-\u03b2, which can determine viral pathogenesis and is associated with virus-induced cell apoptosis412. Influenza virus-infected mice with heterozygous mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator had higher levels of IL-6 and alveolar macrophages in the BAL fluid, and did not develop ALI33. Such effects were associated to TGF-\u03b2-dependent production of IL-633. Recently, it was shown that integrin \u03b26 subunit gene knockout mice had increased survival after influenza infection and reduced ALI, which were attributed to the loss of \u03b26-activated TGF-\u03b2 and increases in activated CD11b+ alveolar macrophages and type I interferon signaling in the lung34. These results are in accordance with our findings. We show that IL-6 is essential for the survival and the recovery from severe lung injury in mice after influenza infection, which is associated with reduced TGF-\u03b2 production. Loss of IL-6 interferes with the functions of lung fibroblasts, including increases in proliferation rate and migratory capability, as well as resistance to virus-induced apoptosis, which may be mediated by increased TGF-\u03b2 production. Notably, accumulation of fibroblasts in the lung causes deposition of collagen and fibronectin. Furthermore, addition of recombinant IL-6 to the lung epithelial cells infected with influenza virus decreased caspase-3 activation, indicative of enhanced survival, and reduced TGF-\u03b2 production. Collectively, we identify a novel role for IL-6 in the lung repair process.",

These findings are in agreement with our results that IL-6 is essential for alleviating influenza symptoms and subsequent lung injury by promoting macrophage recruitment to the lung and by phagocytosing virus-infected cells.

            "text": "Several lines of evidence have suggested that TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 can regulate each other in different circumstances. IL-6 increases trafficking of TGF-\u03b2 receptor to non-lipid raft-associated pools, resulting in augmented TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling39. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21-induced IL-6 expression participates in trans-differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts40. By contrast, TGF-\u03b2 inhibits IL-6 signaling by reducing Stat activity in the intestinal epithelial cells, and serves as a negative regulator in uncontrolled inflammation41. We show that TGF-\u03b2 production is upregulated in the lung of IL-6 knockout mice. Furthermore, addition of recombinant IL-6 to IL-6\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts reduces virus-induced TGF-\u03b2 production, whereas addition of neutralizing IL-6 antibody in lung epithelial cells increases TGF-\u03b2 production. Our results are partially consistent with a previous study showing that hepatocyte growth factor and IL-6 inhibit TGF-\u03b2-mediated fibroblast-myofibroblast transition through reduction of \u03b1-SMA expression42. These findings suggest that IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 may positively or negatively regulate each other under different conditions.",

We identify a novel role for IL-6 produced by fibroblasts during influenza infection in promoting apoptosis and reducing proliferation of fibroblasts, as well as balancing fibroblast migration through downregulating TGF-\u03b2 production. Moreover, IL-6 is essential for macrophages to phagocytose virus-infected cells. In influenza infection, mice deficient in IL-6 had decreased survival and more severe lung injury. Therefore, we demonstrate that IL-6 not only acts as an immune regulator for defending against influenza, but also plays an important role in balancing lung environment.",

(a) Phagocytosis of FITC-labeled IAV was measured by flow cytometry and expressed as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) (n = 3). (b) The macrophages treated with 5 \u00d7 1010 QD649 particles for 30 min were stained with DAPI, and their phagocytic activity was determined by the Celigo cytometer. Representative images are shown (original magnification \u00d7200, scale bar = 100 \u03bcm). The percentage of phagocytosis was identified as the proportion of macrophages (blue) engulfing QD649 (red) (n = 4). (c) The macrophages were cultured with biotin labeled-MDCK cells that had been infected with IAV at an MOI of 1 for 2 h, permeabilized, and then fixed for immunofluorescence staining. The cell mixtures were stained with anti-F4/80 antibody and Dylight-488 for detection of macrophages and biotin-labeled MDCK cells, respectively. The phagocytic activity was measured with the Celigo cytometer. Representative images are shown (original magnification \u00d7200, scale bar = 100 \u03bcm). The percentage of phagocytosis was identified as the proportion of macrophages (red) engulfing MDCK cells (green) (n = 4). Arrows indicate macrophages that engulfed virus infected-MDCK cells (yellow).",
