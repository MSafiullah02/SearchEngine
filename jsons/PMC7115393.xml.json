Since then, there have been an estimated 2311 laboratory-confirmed cases with 811 deaths, reported from a total of 27 countries in the eastern Mediterranean region and from 12 countries elsewhere [1]. Saudi Arabia, however, remains the main focus of infection and a disease outbreak in South Korea involving 186 cases was traced back to an index case who had travelled from Saudi Arabia. Whilst the incidence of MERS cases in Saudi Arabia peaked in 2014, there are still a significant number of cases reported from the country and in the period September 2012\u2013May 2018, there were 1844 cases including 716 deaths with a case fatality rate of 38.8% [1]. MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a member of the betacoronavirus genus [3] and as for other betacoronaviruses, bats may provide a natural reservoir for the virus [3], [4], but high levels of antibodies to MERS-CoV in dromedary camels [5] suggest that the dromedary camel is the principal source for animal-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV [6]. However, evidence of human-to-human transmission comes from the reporting of outbreaks in countries remote from Saudi Arabia such as the UK, Europe, USA, and China where small outbreaks have also occurred [1].",

The spike protein comprises an S1 sub-unit and a membrane fusion S2 sub-unit. In the coronaviruses, the S1 sub-units are further divided into N-terminal and C-terminal sub-domains and for MERS-CoV, it is the C-terminal sub-domain that comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD) [8]. The RBD also incorporates a receptor-binding motif at its C-terminal and the crystal structures of MERS-CoV RBD [8] and of the RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4 have been reported [9].",

            "text": "Here, we were interested to determine the relative importance of inducing systemic and/or mucosal immunity in vaccination to protect against MERS-CoV, an infection predominantly of the respiratory tract and lungs. To this end, we have used a dual route immunisation regimen in Balb/c mice to induce both systemic and mucosal immunity, to generate RBD-specific murine antisera. Initially, we immunised Balb/c mice sub-cutaneously (s.c.) with RBD-Fc in the MF59 adjuvant to induce RBD-specific IgG. Subsequently, we have immunised further groups of Balb/c mice by s.c. priming and per oral (p.o.) boosting with the RBD-Fc, to induce both systemic IgG and mucosal IgA responses. To do this, we have used novel formulations of RBD-Fc coated onto microcrystals formed from histidine or glutamine and also incorporating calcium phosphate for sub-cutaneous priming [17], whilst the formulation for oral boosting comprised RBD-Fc in reverse micelles dispersed in a self-emulsifying oil phase, which has been optimised from previous formulations [18], [19]. The advantages of these formulations are that they are very stable under extremes of temperature [20]. Furthermore, on translation to the clinic, only one injected priming dose would be required, followed by a p.o. booster dose; the latter could be self-administered in capsule form. We have compared the relative abilities of the two sources of antiserum to neutralise clinical isolates of MERS-CoV in vitro. To do this, we have used two clinical strains of MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center 2012 or EMC2012 and London1-2012:), each of which were derived from severely-ill individuals who had contracted the virus in the Middle East in 2012. Subsequent sequencing of the polymerase gene from these isolates indicated them to be newly-emerged members of the betacoronavirus genus with a close sequence homology and phylogenetic relationship to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU-5 [21], [22].",

We have used this transduced mouse model to test the capacity of the antiserum derived from the dual route immunisation to neutralise MERS-CoV in vivo, by passive transfer prior to challenge with the EMC2012 strain and we have demonstrated a significant reduction in viral load in lung tissue in transduced mice.",

This was transferred into the plasmid pEF-DEST51 (Invitrogen) so that the target sequence was expressed as a secreted protein with a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag.

Small scale purifications of RBD-Fc were performed using Protein A chromatography. For this, medium from the transfected cells was treated with ammonium sulphate to precipitate the protein, prior to dialysis and resuspension in buffers for binding to Protein A beads. The latter were washed and eluted with buffer containing 1 M urea.

All four sera gave some neutralisation of viral activity, although at a 1:20 dilution, sera 136 and 169 were most potent, against both viral strains. Sera 136 and 169 were derived from the treatment group immunised with MF59-adjuvanted RBD-Fc, whereas sera 132 and 150 were derived from alhydrogel-adjuvanted RBD-Fc (Fig. 2A).

For this, we selected novel formulations in which RBD-Fc protein was presented as RBD-Fc-PCMC for s.c. priming and incorporated into mineral oil (MO) for p.o. boosting. We compared the serum IgG response achieved from this 2-dose dual route immunisation with that induced to RBD-Fc delivered in MF59 in a 2-dose s.c. regimen (Fig. 3\n). At 1 month after the booster dose, at day 49, there was no significant difference in the serum IgG titres achieved, so that the 2-dose dual-route immunisation with RBD-Fc-PCMC for s.c. priming and incorporated in MO with excipients for p.o. boosting, was just as immunogenic as the 2-dose s.c. immunisation with RBD-Fc in MF59 (Fig. 3A). At day 49, the serum response to RBD-Fc in the dual-route regimen was predominantly IgG1 biased, whereas s.c. dosing with RBD-Fc in the presence of MF59 induced both IgG1 and IgG2a (Fig. 3B).",

We were interested in determining the advantage of r a vaccine which could induce mucosal as well as specific systemic immunity to the key target, the RBD protein, in order to achieve optimum protective efficacy. Vaccination to induce effective immunity at mucosal surfaces, should prime the immune system to respond rapidly to invading pathogens such as MERS-CoV. Previous studies have used adenovirus delivery of the MERS Spike protein with intra-muscular (i.m.) or intra-gastric (i.g.) delivery to induce neutralising systemic IgG, but not IgA; further, whilst i.m. delivery also induced specific T-cell immunity, i.g. delivery did not [29]. Others have shown that intra-nasal delivery of a live attenuated adenovirus-vectored sub-unit vaccines does induce specific mucosal as well as systemic immunity, although translation of this approach to the clinic may raise safety issues [30]. Here, we have relied on novel formulations of a sub-unit protein to enable dual route vaccination (parenteral and oral) to induce mucosal as well as systemic immunity.",

To counter a viral infection, it would be expected that a Th1 response would be most appropriate.

Vaccination of the zoonotic host, the dromedary camel, may also effectively curb outbreaks of MERS in endemic regions and limit the risk of viral recombination [34] and significant progress with an orthopox-vectored vaccine for MERS has recently been reported [35]. The potential use of a sub-unit vaccine for MERS in camel vaccination could be aided by varying the sequence of the RBD protein [36] and substituting the human Fc tag with an alternative tag recognised by the camel, to design approaches tailored for animal vaccination, bearing in mind that a single dose vaccine would be ideal in this context.
