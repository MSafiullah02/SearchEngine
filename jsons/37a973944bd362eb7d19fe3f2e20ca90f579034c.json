As we all know, oncology trials are resource-intensive, and approved protocols frequently require significant in-person contact between participants and research and clinical staff. That said, it is critical that we follow CDC recommendations for screening patients and isolating any with fevers/symptoms, postponing nonessential in-person visits, canceling those solely for data collection/research, and arranging for telemedicine interactions as much as possible. These steps are directed toward the dual goals of protecting both our clinical workforce and our often-immunocompromised participant population. Because availability of providers to care for patients is crucial, all efforts must be made to increase supply of personal protective equipment so that exposed providers will be protected and continue to care for their patients.",
