Indeed, infectious events are responsible for 30 % of deaths, with a significant weight between 30 days and 1 year posttransplant (Stehlik et al. 2011). Beyond morbidity and mortality, infectious complications are also associated with a high economic burden due to higher length of hospital stay, increased graft losses, and costs related to indirect effects such as virus-induced malignancies (Gavalda et al. 2014a; Menzin et al. 2011). Beyond this direct burden, microorganisms are also involved in indirect transplant-related complications. For instance, it has been repeatedly shown that the \u201cmicrobially determined immune modulation (MDIM)\u201d could increase the risk of allograft injury or rejection, atherogenesis, malignancies (such as PTLD), and other opportunistic pathogens (Gavalda et al. 2014a). Therefore, preventive measures are cornerstone for the management of heart-transplanted patients (Fishman 2014).",

Therefore, a high number of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents may be causative in heart transplant recipients. Second, the use of immunosuppressive agents may modify the clinical presentations associated with infectious events (Fishman 2014).

However, due to the use of drug-induced immunosuppression, clinical signs and symptoms may be reduced. Of note, noninfectious causes such as metabolic disorders, drug-induced side effects, and primary brain lymphoma should be considered. Early CNS infections (during phase 1) are rare, unless the patient experiences a massive microbial exposure or exhibits an anatomic underlying factor (Wright and Fishman 2014). Furthermore, donor-derived infections may occur in this time period, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis, West Nile virus or herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, or, in case of graft contamination, cryptococcosis, even if the latter case is rare. CNS opportunistic infections mainly occur during phases 2 and 3. Fungal infections (Aspergillus, C. neoformans, Histoplasma, Coccidioides), nocardiosis, toxoplasmosis (if the chosen prophylaxis is not active against T. gondii), and tuberculosis should be considered (Wright and Fishman 2014; Lebeaux et al. 2014a). Viral infections are also possible at that phase (such as HSV or VZV encephalitis). After 6 months, even if the patient may experience infection caused by community-acquired pathogens (S. pneumoniae), the risk of opportunistic pathogens can be increased as prophylaxis is usually interrupted at that stage: herpesviruses, nocardiosis, invasive molds, tuberculosis, and cryptococcosis can be encountered.",

However, brain imaging should be performed before LP in case of localizing neurological signs, seizure, or reduced vigilance. Indeed, these clinical signs might be suggestive of intracranial hypertension. In that case, LP increases the risk of brain herniation (Duffy 1969). If lumbar puncture is performed, several microbiological tests should be performed (Table 19.1).

Beyond serostatus, some specific cell-mediated immunity tests such as QuantiFERON-CMV and ELISpot have been developed to better predict the risk of CMV disease (Manuel et al. 2013a). Due to the strong impact of CMV infection on clinical outcomes, a preventive strategy should be used for both CMV-positive recipients (R+) and CMV-negative recipients with a positive donor (D+/R-). Two preventive strategies are currently available: universal prophylaxis (i.e., administration of antiviral therapy in the first months after transplantation) and preemptive therapy (i.e., repeated realizations of laboratory assays such as (ideally) quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing or pp65 antigenemia \u00b1 administration of antiviral therapy once an early viral replication has been diagnosed). Their roles are summarized in Table 19.3. If universal prophylaxis is selected, routine viral load monitoring should not be encouraged in asymptomatic patients as this strategy is not cost-benefit. For CMV prophylaxis, oral valganciclovir (900 mg once daily) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg once daily) have proven their efficacy. Both valganciclovir and ganciclovir dosages should be adjusted to renal function.

Mainly because of poor interhospital correlation of PCR assays until the recent creation of an international World Health Organization (WHO) standard, no consensual cutoff value has been determined to initiate antiviral therapy in patients with isolated replication without identified disease. While a low threshold should most likely be used in D+/R- couples to initiate antiviral therapy and prevent direct and indirect effects of CMV infection, it is unclear when to initiate therapy in CMV seropositive heart transplant recipients. Kinetics of DNAemia may offer additional information. The role of CMV detection by PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage is still a matter of debate.

As a consequence, it may lead to a wide range of presentations ranging from asymptomatic viremia to posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). EBV serological testing should be realized for risk stratification before transplant for both donor and recipient. EBV-negative recipients of EBV-positive heart transplants (D+/R-) have the highest risk of PTLD. In this high-risk population, EBV-positive PTLD typically occurs within 1 year after transplantation. Because increased EBV viral load is linked to aberrant EBV-induced B-cell proliferation, the question of viral load monitoring is of interest. However, such strategies of monitoring are imperfectly correlated with the risk of developing EBV-positive PTLD, especially due to a low-positive predictive value. Moreover, this tool has no utility for predicting EBV-negative PTLD. In patients who are at high risk for PTLD (such as EBV D+/R\u2212 patients and/or recipients with chronic EBV viremia), preemptive reduction in immune suppression appears to be an effective first-line strategy.

Infections with CARVs should be suspected in all solid organ transplant recipients with symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Specimens should be taken as soon as possible from the site of clinical involvement. In case of upper respiratory tract symptoms, pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are recommended. In case of lower respiratory tract infection, BAL should be made when possible, in order to exclude other infectious diseases. Laboratory diagnostic methods mainly include antigen detection assays, virus isolation by cell culture, and nucleic acid amplification testing. When available, the latter is a rapid and highly sensitive tool for clinicians. Prevention is a major tool to prevent infection by CARVs in solid organ transplant recipients. Inactivated vaccination is highly recommended to prevent influenza in solid organ transplant recipients, even if conflicting results have been published concerning its immunogenicity in heart transplant recipients. Meanwhile, vaccination of household contacts and health-care workers attending transplanted patients should be done annually. To prevent infections with CARVs in transplant recipients, general preventive measures are also mandatory (including contact avoidance with individuals suffering from respiratory tract infection and young children, hand hygiene, and adapted isolation of infected patients). Promising results have been published concerning the use of prophylaxis by neuraminidase inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients during influenza season (Ison et al. 2012). Curative treatment options are presented in Table 19.2. Antiviral therapy using neuraminidase inhibitors should be administered in all heart transplant recipients with suspected influenza infection, even if symptoms started several days earlier. In severe cases, reduction of immune suppression should be considered.",

While this disease has been first described in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937, many countries are currently concerned all over the world. Notably, a worrisome outbreak is observed in North America since 1999. Transmission has also occurred through blood transfusion and transplantation with an infected organ. While 80 % of WNV infections are asymptomatic in immunocompetent subjects, symptomatic forms range from West Nile fever (a self-limiting febrile illness) to neuroinvasive diseases (meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis) and myocarditis. Solid organ transplant recipients are at higher risk for severe disease (Singh et al. 2013). Incubation varies from 3 to 14 days. The diagnosis of WNV depends on a high index of suspicion. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid analysis should include WNV serological assays and nucleic acid testing. WNV treatment is mainly supportive and may include reduction of immunosuppression, use of interferon or passive immunization using anti-WNV antibodies. In the absence of an available vaccine, protection against mosquito bites should be recommended in the concerned areas.",

Invasive candidiasis is associated with a high mortality (\u224830\u201340 %) (Gavalda et al. 2014b).

Initial treatment of candidemia should rely on intravenous echinocandins. All central venous catheters should be removed, except in specific and complex situations, and venous ultrasonography, cardiac echocardiography, and funduscopy should be performed. Antifungal treatment should be prescribed for 14 days after the first negative blood culture (Gavalda et al. 2014b). Asymptomatic candiduria, a common phenomenon, should not be treated unless the patient is neutropenic or is about to have a urological procedure. However, symptomatic candiduric patients must be treated, and urinary catheters should be removed or replaced.",

As the use of prophylaxis with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole significantly decreases this risk, most of cases occur after cessation of this preventive agent (Wang et al. 2012).

In transplant recipients, toxoplasmosis can result from the transmission of the parasite with the graft (D+) to a seronegative recipient (R-) or from a reactivation of a pretransplant latent infection in a seropositive recipient (R+) (Derouin et al. 2008). In the first case, clinical signs usually occur in the first 3 months after heart transplantation (sometimes earlier, within 2 weeks) with febrile myocarditis, encephalitis, or pneumonia. Without prophylaxis, incidence of disseminated toxoplasmosis in case of mismatch (D+/R-) may reach 75 %, but trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis efficiently prevents this complication. The second option (reactivation of a latent infection R+ patient) is less frequent. Even if serological reactivation (defined by a rise in IgG antibody titers, with a high avidity index) occurs in \u22485 % of R+ patients, a clinical toxoplasmosis is exceptional (Derouin et al. 2008). The diagnosis of disseminated toxoplasmosis relies on the identification of the parasite or its DNA (through PCR testing) in any involved organ or in the blood. Serologic diagnostic might be useful but does not have enough sensitivity or specificity. Even if trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole is highly effective in preventing toxoplasmosis, the risk might appear after cessation of the drug or if it is replaced by aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis against PcP.

After a proliferation step in the duodenum, larvae may reach the bloodstream, the lungs, and then the gut. Thus, hyperinfection syndrome usually associates respiratory symptoms leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal symptoms (from abdominal pain to gastrointestinal bleedings or occlusion), and neurological involvement. A frequent complication is the occurrence of a bloodstream coinfection or meningitis cause by Gram-negative enteric bacteria. Due to its severity, hyperinfection syndrome should be prevented in patients awaiting heart transplantation who lived or stayed in area of endemicity (South America, Africa, Southeast Asia), even decades ago. The prevention relies on the treatment of chronic intestinal strongyloidosis with ivermectin before starting chemical immunosuppression (Roxby et al. 2009).",

Human disease can be separated in two different phases: acute and chronic infection (Lattes and Lasala 2014). In most of adult cases, acute infection is spontaneously cleared and frequently asymptomatic. However, without any specific treatment, infection can evolve to the chronic phase. This chronic infection can be asymptomatic but can lead in 30 % of patients to irreversible damages of the following organs: the heart, esophagus, colon, and peripheral nervous system. During acute infection, diagnosis can be made through direct parasitologic examination of the whole blood (with and without concentration) or serologic tests. The later methods only can be used for the diagnosis of the chronic phase. More recently, PCR-based methods performed on the blood, body fluid, or tissues emerged as sensitive tools for the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease with low parasite burden or in case of reactivation.",

            "text": "\nActive tuberculosis (TB) is a severe disease after SOT with mortality ranging between 9.5 and 17 % (Meije et al. 2014). Most cases occur within the first year after transplantation. Strikingly, extrapulmonary or disseminated TB is more frequent than in the general population. As a consequence, all transplant candidates and living donors should ideally be screened for latent tuberculosis with a tuberculin skin test (lecture at 48\u201372 h, positive if induration \u22655 mm). However, due to a reduced sensitivity and false positiveness of tuberculin skin test after vaccination, interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) should be done when possible, independently of the tuberculin skin test result (Meije et al. 2014). In case of positive tuberculin skin test or IGRA test, active TB should be investigated.Active TB can be confirmed only by culturing M. tuberculosis or detecting nucleic acid sequence from a clinical specimen. In case of lung infection, if sputum is negative, BAL, transbronchial biopsy, or mediastinoscopy should be considered. For extrapulmonary TB, any involved site might be sampled (Table 19.1).If active TB is not present, treatment of latent TB is recommended for patients awaiting heart transplantation in any of the following cases: (i) positive TST or IGRA test, (ii) history of untreated TB, or (iii) history of contact with a subject with active TB. In that case, treatment relies on isoniazid (300 mg/day) + vitamin B6 for 9 months, associated with a close monitoring of liver tests and signs of neuropathy (Meije et al. 2014).For the treatment of active TB, rifamycins (rifampicin or rifabutin) can be avoided in case of localized and non-severe infections. In that case, maintenance therapy should last for 12\u201318 months. However, for severe or disseminated TB, a regimen containing rifampicin or rifabutin is mandatory, with a close monitoring of calcineurin or mTOR inhibitors and corticosteroid levels (Meije et al. 2014). In that case, maintenance therapy should last for 9 months. IRIS during the treatment of active TB is possible.Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous and found in a wide range of environments. Even if their incidence is low, it is much higher after SOT than in the general population and may reach 0.24\u20132.8 % after heart transplantation (Meije et al. 2014). Most cases develop cutaneous lesions of the extremities, tenosynovitis, or arthritis (Meije et al. 2014). The diagnosis is confirmed by the isolation of NTM from a normally sterile body site. Even if lung infection is rare (beside lung recipients), its diagnosis is more complex and requires compatible clinical and radiological presentation (Fig. 19.6), exclusion of other diagnosis, and identification of NTM in BAL or two consecutive sputa or pulmonary tissue. Treatment of NTM requires antimicrobial therapy, surgical excision, or drainage and reduction of immunosuppressant drugs. Association of two or three drugs will be chosen, based on the initial severity and the identification of the bacterial species (Meije et al. 2014).\n\n",

Needed vaccinations should also be initiated during pretransplant care.Preventive strategies (prophylaxis and preemptive therapy) increase the survival of heart transplant recipients. Main agents to consider are Herpesviridae (such as CMV, HSV, and VZV), influenzae, hepatitis viruses, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Depending on factors such as donor specificities, pretransplant colonizations, drug-induced immunosuppression used, time post heart transplantation, local specificities, prophylactic regimen used, and clinical presentation, likely pathogens should be considered and guide first-line diagnostic investigations once an infection is suspected.A wide range of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents may cause infection after heart transplantation. An extensive clinical and radiological work-up is mandatory due to diagnostic pitfalls in these patients.Early infections (within 4 weeks) after heart transplantation suggest surgical site and wound infections or graft-transmitted disease.Clinical and radiological aspects have low predictive values to predict the causative microbial pathogen involved. Bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy of any involved organ play an important role due to the broad spectrum of causative pathogens.Antimicrobial resistance is a matter of concern in heart transplant recipients. Useless antimicrobial therapies should be avoided, and catheters and other devices should be removed when no longer essential. Antimicrobial therapies should be targeted against identified pathogen(s).\n",
