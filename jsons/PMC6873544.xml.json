Previous studies identified several risk factors for developing S. maltophilia HAP in critically ill patients, such as prolonged ICU hospitalization associated with invasive procedures, extended periods of mechanical ventilation, or exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics [3\u20135]. Therefore, S. maltophilia pneumonia occurs preferentially in patients with the poorest prognosis [6, 7]. However, these studies were conducted from heterogeneous and small cohorts of patients. The severity of S. maltophilia HAP and antimicrobial therapy modalities were sparsely reported [3, 4]. Hence, data are lacking to draw recommendations on the optimal therapeutic strategies against S. maltophilia pneumonia.",

One may argue that our study suffers from inaccurate diagnoses differentiating between VAP and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis due to its retrospective design using ICD codes. We acknowledge that the diagnosis method (ETA versus BAL or PSB) may influence the detection of S. maltophilia. This was a pragmatic study that describes different ICU practices, and to date, there is no formal evidence of improved outcomes depending on the diagnosis method used [50]. Despite strict inclusion criteria, and search for consensus in case of debatable case, it is possible that the physician\u2019s judgment and diagnosis reported in the medical record were inaccurate.

Its onset is hard to predict because of lack of specific risk factors but occurs mainly in long-stay ICU patients. The present study did not provide evidence of a significant effect of delay, duration, or combination of antimicrobial therapy on mortality. Efforts in developing novel and effective approaches for prevention are warranted.",
