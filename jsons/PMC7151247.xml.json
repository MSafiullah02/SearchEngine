Urgent chest x-rays demonstrated interstitial involvement of the lungs, which is suggestive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (Figure 2\n). The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was then confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, and so the patient was transferred to a negative pressure airflow room. In the next days, due to the recurrence of chest pain and hyperthermia, accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and mild hypoxia, we decided to have a second, urgent heart team discussion after the evaluation by the infectious disease specialist and the intensivist. Based on the hypothesis that the patient\u2019s respiratory function may deteriorate further, it was decided to treat the coronary disease percutaneously to avoid surgical-related morbidity, going beyond current practice guidelines (1).",
