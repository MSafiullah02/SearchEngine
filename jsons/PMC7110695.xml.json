These variables are modified by personality, experiences and behavior; and they differ according to age, gender, culture, race, social status and education [3]. Infectious disease risks for international travelers are moving targets, as new diseases have emerged and old ones have re-emerged. The diseases that travelers come in contact with have changed. Some countries have become safer overall, but other countries are experiencing new diseases or the re-emergence of past diseases. For example, travelling to the developing world necessarily puts travellers and migrants at risk for infectious diseases, with 20%\u201370% of returned travellers suffering some sort of illness [4], [5], [6].",

Traveling contributes to the global spread of infectious diseases, including novel and emerging pathogens; the global epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was a prime example [10]. More recently, international travelers infected with novel H1N1 influenza played a major role in the rapid global spread of the virus [11]. Travelers have also carried pathogens to areas of the world where these pathogens were rare or had been eliminated. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles [12] and mumps [13] in the United States have been traced to contact with persons who had traveled to locations where vaccination was less prevalent. In addition, travel and migration have contributed to recent introduction or reintroduction of vector-borne diseases in places that had been free from these diseases, such as locally acquired dengue in Florida [14], malaria in Greece [15] and also in Great Exuma Island in the Caribbean [16].",

Oman has achieved remarkable developments in health care within a relatively short span of 4 decades and has developed a good infrastructure for health services. Health care in Oman is largely the responsibility of the state and the cost is borne by the government. As of 2013, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had 195 primary care centers and 49 hospitals. Out of these 49 hospitals, there are 4 in the capital area of Muscat, which offer tertiary care services. The primary health centers offer primary care services to the population residing in the assigned catchment area of the center. The secondary and tertiary care services are provided through a referral process.",
