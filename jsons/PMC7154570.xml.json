However, exaggerated synthesis of IL-6 can lead to an acute severe systemic inflammatory response known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, a study found that a CRS involving a considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines occurred, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).",
