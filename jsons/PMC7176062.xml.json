There is increasing concern amongst cancer professionals all over the world that the longer-term effects of the strategy of lockdowns and varying degrees of closure of \u2018routine\u2019 clinical activity, currently in force across much of the world, have not been fully thought through. While this strategy may prove effective against the coronavirus, there are serious doubts as to whether its effects on other diseases, and the implications of delay in treatment of other conditions, have been seriously considered. Any planning of an exit strategy from lockdown and social distancing must take into account the needs of cancer patients and of others with serious conditions who cannot wait, seemingly interminably, for treatment.",
