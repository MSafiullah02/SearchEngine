Some authors have investigated the pharmacological effects of \u03b2GA and \u03b1GA, demonstrating that their activity is qualitatively very similar, but with different intensity: for instance, the antihepatotoxic activity of \u03b2GA is higher than that of \u03b1GA, while its anti-inflammatory activity is considerably lower [15], [16]. Differences were also observed in the activity of cis and trans isomers in inhibiting the mutagenicity in Salmonella typhymurium\n[17]. Other authors have described the metabolism of G to GA, by observing the formation of the two isomers in animal species [4].
