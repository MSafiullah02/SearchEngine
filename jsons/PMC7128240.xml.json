            "text": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) cause either a mild enteritic disease or a fatal peritonitis in cats. They are thus classified in two groups depending on their pathogenicity: feline enteritic coronaviruses (FECVs) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs) (see for review: Olsen, 1993). Several vaccination trials against the lethal FIPV strains have been attempted but they were often unsuccessful due to a problem of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the disease that leads to early death. In contrast, cats naturally resistant to FIPV present a strong cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and a weak antibody response (Pedersen, 1987). Therefore, an efficient vaccine should preferentially induce a CMI, also called Th1-type response, characterized by CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes secreting interleukin 2 (IL-2) and Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) (Th1 cells) and by CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).",

The S protein has been shown to be responsible of ADE and thus does not induce a protective immune response (Vennema et al., 1990). In contrast, the M protein, but not the N protein, is partially protective when expressed by poxvirus vectors like vaccinia or canarypox viruses (Paoletti and Gettig, 1997; Vennema et al., 1991). Such protection occurred in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, and was thought to be due to CMI.",

MVA is an attenuated strain of the vaccinia virus Ankara, that has lost the ability to replicate in mammalian cells (Sutter and Moss, 1992). Thus MVA is safe but remains a strong expression vector because it can still express foreign antigens during both the early and late stages of its life cycle. Herein, we used this feature to construct a recombinant MVA expressing the M protein (MVA-M) during both stages in order to synthesize larger amounts of antigen compared to the canarypox-M and vaccinia-M vaccines.",

To gain information on this point, a group of mice was first primed with MVA, before being vaccinated with MVA-M. We observed that MVA-immune mice developed, after the MVA-M boost, FIPV-specific antibody titers equal to naive mice after a single MVA-M injection. These data support the idea that the vector is not neutralized. This is in accordance with what was reported with a recombinant MVA expressing the HIV-1 Env gene (Ramirez et al., 2000b). Surprisingly, this mode of vaccination modified the T helper status of the response, since MVA-primed mice clearly showed a Th2-type response against FIPV, as evidenced by the predominant anti-M IgG1 antibodies and by IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA expression in splenocytes. But the most striking effect was that IFN-\u03b3 was no longer detectable by RT\u2013PCR in wtMVA-primed mice, whereas this cytokine was expressed after vaccination of naive mice. These results confirm those of Ramirez et al. who reported a decrease of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8+ T cells in mice primed with MVA and boosted with MVAenv (Ramirez et al., 2000b). Thus, these observations indicate that MVA is able to induce a Th2 environment by itself, hence predisposing the immune system to raise a Th2 response against co-expressed antigens.",

The latter could influence or decrease activation of Th1 cells since IL-18 acts in synergy with IL-12 to promote IFN-\u03b3 secretion (Okamura et al., 1998). This interference could provide one explanation for the emergence of a Th2 environment and especially for inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 expression consequently to a poxvirus prime, despite the induction of IL-12 (Fig. 3).

In MVA, the M gene is controlled by the modified PH5 promoter, which enables a strong expression during both early and late stages of the viral cycle. Early expression of an antigen by a poxvirus is known to induce a cell-mediated immunity, whereas late expression favors the humoral immunity (Bronte et al., 1997). Thus the late expression of the M protein by MVA-M explains the high FIPV-specific IgG response. These antibodies may have contributed to the pathology because FIPV is an immune-mediated disease.
