This software system is typically used to select patients who may benefit from endovascular thrombectomy by identifying occlusions of major brain arteries or regions of the brain with potentially reversible ischemia that have not become infarcted.5 Imaging data with demographic information are uploaded in real time to a data repository. The vendor of RAPID was not involved in the analysis or interpretation of the data or the writing of this letter. The first author serves on the medical advisory board of the vendor, and the last author is a consultant to the vendor.

The daily counts of unique patients who underwent imaging decreased in March 2020 (Figure 1). We therefore chose to compare the mean daily counts per hospital of patients in the RAPID system in an ostensibly prepandemic 29-day epoch from February 1, 2020, through February 29, 2020, with the mean daily counts per hospital of patients in a 14-day epoch during the early pandemic, from March 26, 2020, through April 8, 2020. During the prepandemic epoch, the numbers of patients per hospital who underwent imaging were similar to the baseline numbers immediately before the prepandemic epoch. The nadir of the daily counts after the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the United States occurred during the 14-day epoch. The number of patients who underwent imaging decreased by 39%, from 1.18 patients per day per hospital in the prepandemic epoch to 0.72 patients per day per hospital in the early-pandemic epoch (see Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). An apparent increase in the number of patients who underwent imaging after the early-pandemic epoch warrants further investigation.",

Decreases in the numbers of patients who underwent stroke imaging were seen in most states and across a range of hospital volumes (Fig. S3 and Table S2). These decreases suggest that differences in regional incidences of Covid-19 were not the primary cause of decreased use of stroke imaging.",
