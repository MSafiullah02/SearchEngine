These limitations have a direct impact on our ability to enact purposeful activities, and without this life engagement, to feel a sense of direction to our lives1. Given the focus on how COVID-19 is impacting work, often missing is discussion on how the pandemic is influencing retirees, and their ability to remain purposeful. This omission is problematic given that sense of purpose predicts reduced risk for disability among retirement community members2, and retired adults may experience greater susceptibility to declining sense of purpose even under normal circumstances3. The current pandemic further exacerbates this risk for decline, given the lockdowns at several retirement facilities, limiting family visits and social activities.",

Given this challenge, we suggest three potential routes to scaffold members\u2019 sense of purpose.

The retirement community though presents unique challenges. The ability to assist members may be limited due to personnel having to attend to other aspects of the community lockdown. In addition, several communities may be ill-equipped to allow members access to online resources simultaneously. Therefore, it may prove valuable to create schedules that allow members to plan their days around meeting with family and friends.",

In interviews with retirement community members, we found that several interviewees were driven by activities that impacted and helped other members4. Clearly physical distancing guidelines are important, particularly in a population more susceptible to the ill-effects of COVID-19. However, retirement communities may infuse community engagement through joint activities between members in their individual living spaces. It also may be important to encourage correspondence between members, written or electronic. Any efforts to help individuals feel connected may go a long way towards maintaining purposefulness.",

However, with older adults, it may be important to underscore the past challenges that this generation has overcome. Reflection upon major life events appears one route to finding or reengaging with one's purpose5. As such, retirement communities can ask members to revisit past life challenges and identify how they navigated those obstacles. An added benefit is that community members\u2019 reflections may inform people outside the community on how to deal with the crisis. Indeed, perhaps the best way to help retirement community members feel purposeful is to let them help us to do the same.",
