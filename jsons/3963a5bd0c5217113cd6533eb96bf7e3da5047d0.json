An average transport network is found using a recently developed variant of the effective medium approximation (EMA) that is capable of dealing with these long-range connections. Using a Feynman-Kac argument in the effective medium, we derive an estimate on the size of the infected domain, and reproduce the known result of its exponential growth in time. We hereby demonstrate the applicability of long-range EMA to dynamical processes on networks more intricate than simple diffusion.",

            "text": "Understanding the spread of emergent infectious diseases in the geographic space is of fundamental importance in an increasingly connected world. In ancient times, the spreading of epidemics, such as the black death, could be understood in terms of diffusive processes [1] . In those cases the disease is spread by the agents/hosts that can only travel with bounded velocities between neighboring locations. This gives rise to a wave-front of infected individuals, which travels at a finite speed. The recent great increase of the connectivity among densely populated areas and the correspondent urbanization, has increased the risk that infectious diseases will spread. The complexity of human mobility at all scales, being that urban and inter-urban or world-wide, is reflected in the possibility for the infection to cross arbitrary distances in close to no time. As a consequence, the number of infected sites grows exponentially fast, as opposed to linearly. Similar phenomena are also discussed in a different biological context, see Ref. [12] and references therein. Network theory's success stems not only from its versatility, but even more from the fact that many dynamical processes can be characterized and understood from the * iannelli.flavio@gmail.com \u2020 thiel@posteo.de underlying connectivity properties of the graph [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Often, exact knowledge of the network connectivity eludes the theorist, because they are either quickly changing-as is the case in temporal networks [19] -or are hard to assess. In this case a practical approach is to model our ignorance with a random network.",

The simplest spatial networks are of course lattices. In the context of percolation theory, the so-called effective medium approximation has been developed to describe the diffusion on disordered-i.e., random-lattices [24, 25] . The idea is to replace the initially random transport rates between the nodes with fixed deterministic ones. This deterministic average network is called the effective medium, it is characterized by an effective diffusion coefficient. EMA is not a blind average of the transport rates, rather it is determined in a self-consistent manner. Would a link in the effective medium be replaced by its random original, the transport flux along this particular link would not change on average. Hence EMA is particularly suited for systems with independent links. In this paper, we employ EMA for infection spreading in the global human traffic network.",

Crucially, empirical observations show that human mobility lacks a definite scale [10, 26] and features long-range connections which have been a major limitation for EMA. Recently [27] , we have developed an EMA variant that overcomes this restriction and provides an analytical technique to deal with random spatial networks-a model of tremendous complexity. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that and how EMA can be used in reaction-diffusion systems on random spatial networks with long-range connections. Contemporary fields where our proposed theory may become relevant are epidemic spreading in the global mobility network [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] or dispersal phenomena in biological contexts [12] .",

Here, we assume diffusive coupling between the subpopulations. The individuals travel in the metapopulation and forget about their original subpopulation at each time step.

We can draw the same conclusions for the random model as we did for the deterministic one, namely that the diameter of the infected regions grows exponentially, just like in Eq. (14) . Although, this behavior is known in the literature [35, 42, 43] , EMA opens a new way to analytically compute the speed of the infection spreading or even other quantities of desire. Importantly, the method presented here is not limited to the simple topology and the simple choice of transport rates that we used in Eq. (17) . In our example, the effective medium transport rates are simple averages of the original rates and the EMA result becomes equal to the annealed adjacency matrix approximation of Ref. [21] . This is however a consequence of the high connectivity and the power-law in Eq. (17) and doeas not have to hold in general. For more general topologies or other scaling relations, a different effective medium has to be chosen. This is already seen in the traditional EMA examples, e.g., a random short-range model (the so-called random barrier model, see e.g., [44] ), where only next-neighbor transport is allowed.

This is a reasonably close value to the L\u00e9vy exponent \u03b1 = 1.5 used for generating the graph realizations in the first place. D(t ) is only presented before the saturation sets in, and before the whole ring is infected. We now consider the SIS model in N = 8000 subpopulations with \u03b2 = 0.2 and \u03bc = 0.1, which gives a basic reproductive number of R 0 = 2. The correct time frame to assess D(t ) is visible in a prevalence plot; see Fig. 3 . In this figure the curves \u03c1 x (t ) for each x are plotted against time; the stationary value \u03c1 x (\u221e) = 1 \u2212 \u03bc/\u03b2 as well as the time when \u03c1 x (t ) >c can be read from such a plot. For N = 8000 subpopulations the time gap between the outbreaks of the first and last subpopulation infected is 124 time steps, and the absolute global infection time is 193 time steps. As expected, the results are similar to the SI case.
