            "text": "Avian influenza viruses (AIV) within the Orthomyxoviridae family have segmented, negative sense RNA genomes. These viruses, natural infectious agents of waterfowl and shorebirds, are classified according to their transmembrane hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins (Alexander, 2000, Krauss et al., 2007, Olsen et al., 2006, Webby and Webster, 2001). Due to their incredibly broad avian host range, AIV strains have been isolated from many different species of birds including ducks, gulls, geese, psittacines and poultry (Alexander, 2000, Olsen et al., 2006). AIV strains with all 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) types have been isolated from waterfowl or shore birds (Fouchier et al., 2005, Krauss et al., 2007). Depending on the virulence of the virus in poultry, isolates from poultry are classified as either low pathogenic (LP) or highly pathogenic (HP) (Alexander, 2000, Collisson et al., 2008). LPAIV strains cause asymptomatic to mild respiratory and enteric tract infections while the highly pathogenic strains cause clinical illness and systemic infections. Infections of poultry, especially with the highly pathogenic strains, result in severe economic losses (Capua and Marangon, 2003, Tollis and Di Trani, 2002). Human influenza viruses, including those causing high morbidity and significant mortality, such as the H1N1 from 1918, H2N2 from 1957 and H3N2 from 1968 have been shown to have avian origins (Capua and Alexander, 2002, Taubenberger et al., 2001). Even the currently circulating swine origin H1N1 human influenza virus encodes two genes of AIV origin (Babakir-Mina et al., 2009, Garten et al., 2009). Since 1996, highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV strains isolated in Hong Kong have been infecting and subsequently causing deaths in humans, although person-to-person transmission is apparently rare (Capua and Alexander, 2002, Perdue and Swayne, 2005, Ungchusak et al., 2005). Poultry is a logical intermediate host for adaptation of viral strains from wild birds to humans and other mammals, such as swine (Webby and Webster, 2001, Webster, 1997). Indeed, human adapted strains have been shown to consist of genome segments of avian, swine and human origin (Webby and Webster, 2001, Webster, 1997).",

While sterile immunity may depend on humoral responses to homologous HA, effector and memory CD8+ T cell immunity in mice has been shown to diminish disease preventing mortality, and even morbidity (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2007, Swain et al., 2004). Humoral immunity of chickens to AIV is well characterized but little information is available regarding the more difficult to evaluate, viral specific T cell immune responses (Kwon et al., 2008, Seo and Webster, 2001, Swayne and Kapczynski, 2008). Because mice are not natural hosts of AIV, all the immunological characterization in mice is based only on mouse adapted viruses. It is relevant to define the T lymphocyte mediated immune responses in chickens since AIVs are established pathogens of poultry and can be transmitted directly from chickens to humans.",

The availability of a number of poultry lines with defined MHC (located within the chicken B locus) greatly facilitates the evaluation of the adaptive T lymphocyte responses in chickens (Miller et al., 2004). Studies targeting acute infections with a strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, have identified specific CD8+ T cell responses (Seo and Collisson, 1997). Adoptive transfer of either effector T cells prepared from birds 10 days post-infection (p.i.) or of memory T lymphocytes prepared from birds 3 weeks after infection with IBV, provided protection against acute disease after viral challenge (Pei et al., 2003, Seo et al., 2000). Following infection with H9N2 AIV, Seo et al. (2002) described CD8+ T cell responses that correlated with cross-protection to an H5N1 strain. Protection by effector CD8+ T lymphocytes prepared at 7 to 10 days p.i. with AIV was demonstrated following adoptive transfer 1 day prior to AIV challenge (Seo and Webster, 2001). However, none of these studies with AIV identified the individual AIV proteins housing T lymphocytes epitopes or described the kinetics of the T lymphocyte mediated memory responses to AIV.",

Studies evaluating the CD8+ T lymphocyte response to influenza virus in mice have identified NP as housing the dominant CD8+ T cell epitopes (Flynn et al., 1998, Kreijtz et al., 2007, O'Neill et al., 2000, Townsend et al., 1984, Yewdell et al., 1985). In contrast, human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have a broader repertoire and the response is directed to multiple influenza viral proteins, including HA (Gianfrani et al., 2000, Gotch et al., 1987, Jameson et al., 1998, Kedzierska et al., 2006, Kreijtz et al., 2008). This study has shown that similar to the responses in humans, memory CD8+ T lymphocytes in chickens are directed against both AIV HA and NP proteins (Gianfrani et al., 2000, Jameson et al., 1998, Kreijtz et al., 2008, McMichael et al., 1986b). Significantly greater responses were induced by NP than by HA at 3 and 5 weeks p.i. The AIV specific T cell responses were primarily MHC-I restricted as non-professional APCs of B19 and B2 haplotypes were used for ex vivo stimulation of T cells and the APCs of B2 haplotype chickens either failed to stimulate or could only weakly stimulate the T lymphocytes derived from the B19 line. Therefore, responding T cells were primarily of the CD8+ phenotype, which also showed significantly greater proliferation than CD4+ T lymphocytes in response to ex vivo APC mediated stimulation. Similar to the MHC-I restricted T lymphocyte responses demonstrated following infection with IBV, CD8+ T cell memory responses to AIV HA and/or NP were detected by 3 weeks p.i. (Pei et al., 2003). Preliminary studies in our lab have also demonstrated an elevation in the levels of expression of CD44 molecule on the surface of the responding T lymphocytes. Greater CD44 expression has been described to be a characteristic of mouse and human memory T lymphocytes (Curtsinger et al., 1998).",

In mice, adoptive transfer of memory CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for influenza virus NP has also been shown to be protective against viral challenge (Lukacher et al., 1984, Taylor and Askonas, 1986). In vivo inoculation of chicks with a DNA plasmid expressing the IBV nucleocapsid protein was shown to provide CTL mediated protection against acute respiratory disease (Seo et al., 1997). Consistent with the greater response to NP from the homologous virus, T lymphocytes of chicks inoculated with NP exhibited greater cross reactivity with the heterologous H7N2 virus than T cells from the birds inoculated with HA. The amino acid sequences in HA from the two AIV strains were 41% identical while the amino acid sequences of NP were 97% identical. The more conserved nature of NP, in comparison to HA could be responsible for the greater cross reactive response (Portela and Digard, 2002). Although the variation could also be attributed to the differences in the amount of antigen generated and presented by the infected APCs (Busch and Pamer, 1998, Crowe et al., 2003, Deng et al., 1997, Doherty et al., 1994), both NP and HA responses were similar by 9 weeks p.i. using the same standardized cell assay.",

After 24 h of incubation, the accumulation of nitrite in supernatant from stimulated HD11 cells was measured using the Griess reagent assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To ensure that the data represent the nitric oxide produced specifically by the IFN\u03b3 mediated stimulation of HD11 cells and not due to any other soluble inducing factors, nitrite concentration in each sample was normalized by subtracting the nitrite concentration of supernatants from control APCs cultured without T lymphocytes. The concentration of nitrite produced was determined using sodium nitrite solutions with a concentration of 1 to 20 \u03bcmol as standards.",
