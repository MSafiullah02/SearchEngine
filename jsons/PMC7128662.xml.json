No gross abnormalities were reported, and biopsies were obtained from the stomach, mesenteric lymph nodes and jejunum. Histopathology of the gastric biopsy reported the presence of nodular to coalescing infiltrates, which consisted of histiocytes with neutrophils and variable numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells and abundant fibrosis. No multinucleated giant cells or infectious agents were detected (acid-fast and periodic acid Schiff staining were performed). The lymph node histopathology was similar to that of the gastric biopsy, and the small intestinal histopathology suggested mild to moderate lymphocytic enteritis.",

The disease is typified by systemic proliferation and invasion of tissues by morphologically atypical histiocytes, which occurs simultaneously within multiple sites. This is typically a very aggressive disease, with affected animals showing a rapid clinical course. Infiltrates are commonly identified within the lymph nodes, spleen and liver early in the course of the disease, and the bone marrow later in the course of the disease (Moore and Rosin 1986). Reports of malignant histiocytosis in the cat amount to only seven cases (Court et al., 1993, Freeman et al., 1995, Walton et al., 1997, Fritz et al., 1999, Kraje et al., 2001). The ages of the affected cats ranged from 1 to 13 years, with weight loss, inappetence and lethargy being common presenting signs. The course of the disease was rapid, with euthanasia being performed between 2 and 7 weeks after onset of clinical signs. In the cases reported previously, anaemia, splenomegaly and icterus were consistent findings, with thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperglycaemia being seen frequently. In the three cases where clotting times (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) were performed, they were found to be prolonged (Kraje et al 2001).",

            "text": "Histiocytic diseases other than malignant histiocytosis were considered in the differential diagnoses of this case. Systemic histiocytosis is unlikely, as skin lesions are a consistent finding in this condition (Moore 1984). In disseminated histiocytic sarcoma, a primary histiocytic sarcoma becomes widely distributed throughout the body. Although histiocytic sarcomas often arise on the limbs, they may occur in cryptic sites such as lung, spleen or bone marrow, which may delay their recognition. Unfortunately, once the condition is well advanced, differentiation from malignant histiocytosis can be extremely difficult (Moore and Affolter 2005). While metastatic spread of a histiocytic sarcoma could explain the more insidious onset in this current case, the location of the primary lesion would remain in doubt. A reactive histiocytic disease was considered less likely due to the lack of identification of a causal agent, and the variety of organ systems involved. However, reactive histiocytic disease is poorly documented in the cat.",
