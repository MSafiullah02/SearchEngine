The random nature of DNA propagation is discussed using branching process, coalescent process, Markov process, and diffusion process. Expected evolutionary patterns under neutrality are then discussed on fixation probability, rate of evolution, and amount of DNA variation kept in population. We then discuss various features of neutral evolution starting from evolutionary rates, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, junk DNA, and pseudogenes.",

Systematic pressure, particularly natural selection, was believed to play the major role in evolution. This view is applicable if the population size, or the number of individuals in one population, is effectively infinite. However, the earth is finite, and the number of individuals is always finite. Even this whole universe is finite. This finiteness is the basis of the random nature of neutral evolution as we will see in later sections of this chapter.",

A cell is the basic building block for all organisms except for viruses. It is thus natural to consider cell as unit of evolution. One cell is equivalent to one individual in single-cell organisms. In multicellular organisms, by definition, one individual is composed of many cells, and a single cell is no longer a unit of evolution. However, if we consider only germ-line cells and ignore somatic cells, we can still discuss cell lineages as the mainstream of multicellular organisms as in the case for single-cell organisms. Alternatively, clonal cells of one single-cell organism can be considered to be one individual. Cellular slime mold cells form a single body with many cells, or each cell may stay independently, depending on environmental conditions [6]. We therefore should be careful to define cell or individual.",

In classic population genetics theory, this reproduction unit is called Mendelian population, after Gregor Johann Mendel, father of genetics. From individual point of view, the largest Mendelian population is its species. Asexually reproducing organisms are not necessary to form a population, and multiple individuals observed in proximity, which are often recognized as one population, may be just an outcome of past life history of the organism, and each individual may reproduce independently. Gene exchanges also occur in asexually reproducing organisms, including bacteria. Therefore, by extending species concept, bacterial cells with similar phylogenetic relationship are called species. Population or species is also defined for viruses, where each virus particle is assumed as one \u201cindividual.\u201d",

Supply of mutations to the continuous flow of self-replication of genetic materials (DNA or RNA) is fundamental for organismal evolution. This process is most faithfully described in phylogenetic relationship of genes. Because every organism is product of eons of evolution, we are unable to grasp full characteristics of living beings without understanding the evolutionary history of genes and organisms. It is thus clear that reconstruction of phylogeny of genes is essential not only for study of evolution but also for biology in general. In another words, gene genealogy is the basic descriptor of evolution.",

A gene genealogy is the direct product of DNA replication and always exists, while mutations may or may not happen within a certain time period in some specific DNA region. Therefore, even if many nucleotide sequences happened to be identical, there must be genealogical relationship for those sequences. However, it is impossible to reconstruct the genealogical relationship without mutational events. In this respect, search of mutational events from genes and their products is also important for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.

There are two types of genes that have small difference in their nucleotide sequences, depicted by open and full circles. Both types are located in the same location in one particular chromosome of this organism. This location is called \u201clocus\u201d (plural form is \u201cloci\u201d), after a Latin word meaning place, and one type of nucleotide sequence is called \u201callele,\u201d using a Greek word \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf meaning different. Open circle allele, called allele A, is ancestral type, and full circle allele, called allele M, emerged by a mutation shown as a star mark. The numbers of gene copies are 8 and 2 for alleles A and M. We thus define allele frequencies of these two alleles as 0.8 (=8/10) and 0.2 (=2/10). Allele frequency is sometimes called gene frequency. It should be noted that these frequencies are exact values if there are only 10 genes in the population in question. If these 10 genes were sampled from that population with many more genes, two values are sample allele frequency.\n\n",

In this figure, gene genealogy starting from full circle gene at generation 1 is embedded with other genes coexisted at each generation but became extinct.

We consider certain autosomal locus A, and the total number of genes on that locus at generation t is 2N[t]. There are many alleles in locus A, but let us consider one particular allele Ai with ni gene copies. By definition, allele frequency pi for allele Ai is ni/2N[t]. When one sperm or egg is formed via miosis, one gene copy is included in that gamete from locus A. If male and female are assumed to be more or less the same allele frequency, the probability to have allele Ai in that gamete is pi. This procedure is a Bernoulli trial, and the offspring generation at time t+1 will be formed with 2N[t+1] Bernoulli trials. Because all these trials are expected to be independent, we have the following binomial distribution to give the probability Prob[k] of having k gene copies among 2N[t+1] genes in the offspring generation:\n4.1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\mathrm{Prob}\\left[\\mathrm{k}\\right] =_{2\\mathrm{N}\\left[\\mathrm{t}+1\\right]}\\;{\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{k}}{\\mathrm{p}}_{\\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{k}}{\\left(1-{\\mathrm{p}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)}^{2\\mathrm{N}\\left[\\mathrm{t}+1\\right]-\\mathrm{k}} $$\n\\end{document}Prob[k]=2N[t+1]Ckpik(1\u2212pi)2N[t+1]\u2212k\nwhere xCy is the possible combinations to choose y out of x.

The initial allele frequency was set to be 0.2, and the temporal changes of up to 1,000 generations are shown. In each case, 5 replications are shown.

In diploid organism, the number of gene copies for an autosomal locus is 2N, while the number of gene copies for haploid organism locus is N. The former situation is assumed explicitly or implicitly in many literatures. However, the original lifestyle of organisms is haploid, and many organisms today are haploids. Therefore, we consider the situation in haploid organisms first. It should be noted that the constant population size is more or less expected if we consider a long-term evolution. Otherwise, the species will become extinct or will have exponential growth. Though we, Homo sapiens, in fact experience population explosion, this is a rather rare situation among many species. In short-term evolution, population size is expected to fluctuate for any organism. Therefore, assumption of the constant population size is not realistic and is only for mathematical simplicity. We have to be careful about this sort of too simplistic assumptions inherent in many evolutionary theories. There are some more simplifications in the original coalescent theory: discrete generation and random mating. Random mating means that any gene copy is equal in terms of gene transmission to the next generation, and there is no subpopulation structure within the population of N individuals in question. These assumptions were also used for the Wright\u2013Fisher model.",

If we consider a randomly mating population with constant size N, each gene copy at the present population was sampled from N gene copies of the previous generation with replacement. Therefore, if we choose one particular gene copy, say, copy ID 1, from the present population, the probability of its transmission from a specific gene copy of the previous generation is 1/N.

We then go to the next situation in which gene copy ID 3 from the present population shares the parental gene copy with neither ID 1 nor ID 2. Its probability becomes 1 \u2212 [2/N].

If we apply the coalescent theory under the constant population model, the expected number of generations for coalescence of an autosomal gene, 4N, is 27 billion generations. If one generation is 20 years, the expected coalescent time becomes 540 billion years! This value is far greater than the start of this universe, i.e., Big Bang, approximately 14 billion years ago. This seemingly paradoxical situation simply comes from the population explosion, which violates the assumption of constant population size. To overcome this problem, the \u201ceffective population size\u201d is often used. Modern human is estimated to have ca. 10,000 as the effective population size (e.g., Takahata 1993; [59]).",

The vertical axis represents the whole population, and the population size can vary. Full circles are mutations accumulated in this single lineage, and thin lines represent increase of allele frequency for each mutant. The total number of mutations accumulated during time T is \u03bcT. Therefore, the evolutionary rate, \u03bb, of gene substitutions per generation should be \u03bcT/T = \u03bc. This argument applies to any time irrespective of population size change. Even if speciation occurs, it does not affect this argument based on the single gene lineage.

Considering this enormous possibility of alleles for even a short DNA fragment, Kimura and Crow (1964; [27]) proposed the infinite allele model. All new mutations are different with each other in this model. The phylogenetic relationship of alleles is not considered in the infinite allele model. Kimura (1969; [28]) thus proposed the infinite site model where an infinitely long DNA sequence is considered. Now new mutations appear by substituting one nucleotide site, which was not changed before. In this sense, this model is similar to the infinite allele model, but now accumulation of nucleotide substitutions can be considered with the infinite site model. This means that a genealogical relationship of alleles is behind this model.

Figure 4.11 shows the semiquantitative proportions of these three categories for a typical mammalian genome. Because the majority of the mammalian genome is noncoding, mutations occurring in this region are selectively neutral. If a mutation occurs in DNA regions where important genetic informations such as protein amino acids and some RNA sequences are coded, this mutation may be deleterious, and the mutant individual may have less possibility of transmitting that gene to the offsprings. In contrast, although in rare occasions, some DNA changes will cause that mutant individual to have more offsprings than those without mutant genes. This type of mutants is called \u201cadvantageous.\u201d In any case, when mutations occur, selectively neutral mutants are dominating. If we consider a long-term evolution, only a small fraction of these mutations will survive.

As we will see, the fixation of selectively neutral mutations via stochastic effects is the main power of evolution, and the natural selection to choose advantageous mutations has only a limited contribution, although natural selection to eliminate deleterious mutations is quite effective to keep the current genetic entity. In short, natural selection is mostly conservative, and the chance effects, including the fixation of selectively neutral mutations, are really responsible for creative nature of evolution.",

Because human and rhesus macaque genomic distance is ~0.06 [36], the average evolutionary rate in terms of nucleotide substitutions is, from Eq. 4.42, \u03bb[primates] = 0.06/[2 \u00d7 30 million] = 1 \u00d7 10\u22129/site/year.

In marked contrast to that situation, nine amino acid substitutions accumulated in the mole rat lineage during 40 million years. Mole rat eye is diminished, and apparently, importance of \u03b1 crystallin, the major lens protein, is reduced.

It is therefore a good approximation that f for synonymous mutations is 1, and the evolutionary rate is identical with mutation rate.

As we will see in 10.1007/978-1-4471-5304-7_5, the evolutionary rate of nonsynonymous substitutions may become larger than the mutation rate when a special type of natural selection is operating, in which any amino acid change is advantageous.

Therefore, such cDNA inserts are almost always \u2018dead on arrival\u2019. We can see a clear enhancement of evolutionary rate for intronless, or processed, pseudogenes for the mouse p53 gene.

By definition, vitamins are not produced by the organism itself, and they should be taken in as a part of food. Their very existences are enigmatic, for these molecules are coming from other organisms which produce them. If vitamins are so important, why are they not produced by a certain species such as human? The neutral theory of evolution easily resolves this paradox. If vitamins are abundant in everyday foods, even the mutants with no ability of producing a certain vitamin are selectively neutral compared to wild types with ability to produce that vitamin through the existing enzymatic pathway.",

Not only human but all primates except for prosimians, elephants, guinea pigs, and fruit bats lack the ability of producing ascorbic acid [51]. Medaka, a teleost fish, also does not produce ascorbic acid [52].

Ever since Charles Darwin, many biologists have been enchanted by seemingly powerful positive selection. They are biologists who study macroscopic morphology of organisms, animal behaviors, developmental process, and so on.
