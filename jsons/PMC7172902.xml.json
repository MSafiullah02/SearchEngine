They are the most common cause for the common cold in both children and adults and are distributed worldwide. Methods of virus typing classified rhinoviruses into RV-A and RV-B groups based on genetic sequence similarity and susceptibility to antiviral agents. More recently, a newly identified group, termed RV-C, has been identified based purely on sequencing data. Interestingly, a number of studies suggest that members of the RV-C group might be intrinsically more virulent, have a greater propensity to cause asthma exacerbations, or both than other rhinoviruses27, 28; however, further work is needed to better define whether a unique clinical picture is associated with RV-C infections.",

Differentiating among acute wheeze, bronchiolitis, postbronchiolitis wheeze, and acute exacerbations of asthma is frequently difficult in infants and young children. Subsequently, the interpretation of pediatric studies is complex, and the prevalence of RSV can vary widely from study to study. In an Australian birth cohort study RSV accounted for 16.8% (second behind rhinovirus) of cases of wheezy respiratory tract infections in the first year of life,32 whereas a detection frequency of 27% was seen in a similar British study.33 RSV in older children and adults is much less frequent; however, it is seen in older adults, in whom it is frequently an underrecognized trigger in acute asthma. A study by Falsey et al34 demonstrated that 7.2% of hospitalizations for asthma in those older than 65 years were associated with RSV infection.34\n",

Since then, numerous studies have investigated a possible association between bacteria (in particular the atypical organisms M pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) and asthma exacerbations. However, because many of the methods for detecting these organisms are not standardized, are insensitive, or are nonspecific, the results across these studies have been inconsistent. Johnston and Martin45 reviewed 12 such studies and found that 9 of 12 demonstrated an association between infection with either M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae and exacerbations. These included a study by Allegra et al46 reporting evidence of atypical bacterial infection with C pneumoniae in 10% of subjects, as well as a prospective study by Lieberman et al47 demonstrating M pneumoniae infection in 18% of hospitalized asthmatic patients compared with 3% in a matched control group. More recently, Cosentini et al48 reported acute infection with C pneumoniae, M pneumoniae, or both in 38% of 58 patients presenting to the hospital with an asthma exacerbation, and in the TELICAST study 60% were serologically positive.49\n",

Of note is that Huang et al56 and Hilty et al57 have both highlighted increased and more diverse lower airway bacterial flora in asthmatic patients.

Children in particular spend more time outdoors and exercise more, and therefore they breathe a greater amount of pollution per kilogram of body weight than adults. However, even in the indoor environment there are many sources of NO2, including fireplaces, heaters, and gas stoves. In children with asthma, NO2 exposure is associated with increased respiratory symptoms,60, 61, 62 and increased personal levels of NO2 are associated with increased severity of virus-induced exacerbations.63 This highlights a potential synergistic effect of these 2 inflammatory stimuli. In addition, controlled exposure studies in asthmatic patients have demonstrated that NO2 can enhance the allergic response to inhaled allergens.64, 65 Although it is difficult to dissect out all the factors that might play a role in the September epidemic, it is possible that seasonal changes in domiciliary air pollution during this period increase the risk of virus-induced exacerbations.",

Reduced emergency department visits and work/school absence was also observed in the thermoplasty group up to 1 year after the procedure, and reduction in severe exacerbations has recently been demonstrated to persist until 3 years.118 Despite these positive results, thermoplasty is unlikely to be widely used because it is very time consuming to administer.",

One such target is inhaled IFN-\u03b2. Interest in this target first arose after work by Corne et al,127 who demonstrated more severe and more prolonged virus-induced asthma symptoms in asthmatic compared with nonasthmatic subjects. Wark et al128 subsequently provided evidence that BECs from asthmatic patients produced lower levels of the type I IFN-\u03b2 and also showed higher levels of rhinovirus replication. The BECs from asthmatic patients responded to exogenous treatment with IFN-\u03b2, exhibiting reduced rhinovirus release and demonstrating that the deficiency in asthmatic cells was associated with production of antiviral IFN-\u03b2 rather than the actions of IFN-\u03b2.128 These results suggest that delivery of IFN-\u03b2 to the lower airways when a cold develops might result in the restoration of antiviral defenses in the lungs of asthmatic patients, limiting the resulting inflammation and thus either preventing or reducing the severity of exacerbations. Importantly, by boosting host defense rather than targeting specific respiratory tract viruses, IFN-\u03b2 is anticipated to have a broad antiviral activity. The results of a phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of IFN-\u03b2 therapy are awaited with interest. Similar deficiencies of the antiviral type III IFN-\u03bbs have been observed in asthmatic patients,129 and these interferons have also recently been reported to profoundly suppress allergic airway inflammation.130 Thus this family of interferons is also a potential treatment of great interest.131\n",

TLR7 is a receptor for viral single-stranded RNA and signals through the adaptor molecule MyD88, activating transcription factors that induce production of a range of antiviral and inflammatory cytokines, such as interferons and TNF-\u03b1.135 Kaufman et al136 recently tested the effects of the synthetic TLR7 agonist imiquimod in guinea pigs in vivo, demonstrating the inhibition of bronchoconstriction within minutes of administration. This novel mechanism to limit bronchoconstriction during respiratory tract infections, in addition to their antiviral properties established some years ago,137 makes compounds such as these attractive candidates in asthma treatment. In addition to these exciting targets, there are many other approaches currently in development, such as kinase inhibitors and phosphodiesterase inhibitors138; however, a full review of these is beyond the scope of this article.",

Respiratory viruses are now well accepted as the main trigger for these exacerbations, and despite the emergence of newly discovered viruses, rhinoviruses remain the most common pathogens detected. Understanding the mechanisms provoking virus-induced airway inflammation in asthmatic patients will likely offer significant opportunities for improved disease management. However, the reality at present is that current drugs for the treatment of virus-induced exacerbations are poorly effective, and alternative therapies to modulate viral pathogenesis are desperately needed. To this end, experimental human and murine models of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations have now been developed,109, 139 offering great potential to increase our mechanistic understanding, as well as providing us with models in which to test potential new therapies. Further study is clearly required to better understand the complicated relationships that exist among viruses, bacteria, and allergic inflammation. Despite the development of newer asthma medications, a recent survey of 2500 asthmatic patients highlighted that in the years between 1998 and 2009, the percentage seeking acute care for their asthma in the preceding 12 months had not changed significantly,140, 141 This is a sobering truth indicative of how much we still need to do.",
