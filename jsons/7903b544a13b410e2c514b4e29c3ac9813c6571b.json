The WHO was notified in early January 2020 of an outbreak of a respiratory disease manifesting with fever, cough and dyspnea, that in some cases provoked a severe pneumonic illness with bilateral invasive pulmonary infiltrates. 7 Since the beginning of the outbreak, there has been an exponential expansion of the infection: 8 the WHO declared it as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30th. 9 The disease was later called COVID-19. Posterior population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S). 10 Its case-fatality rate is estimated to be around 2 to 3% but varies by age and other health conditions. 11",

This implementation offers longitudinal and continuous care for the patients. Concurrently, medical prescriptions are allocated from the Patient Electronic Medical Record (PEMR) to pharmacys' electronic systems and medication is given to patients. 30 Moreover, use and utility of My Health (La meva salut) 31 has increased, a digital platform provided by the public system 1 that posts the patient key medical documents from the PEMR, making it possible for patients to access their sick leave certifications. This capability is in addition to their existing access to discharge reports, laboratory results, radiological and other complementary reports. Furthermore, some private health providers already equipped with video-visit capabilities or apps to chat with doctors are now providing these services for the general public free of charge. 32 Another, point that could be highlighted are the new collaborations established between medtech startups (middle or small medtech companies) that are giving or facilitating the use of their telemedicine platforms to be use for the public health providers, showing a potential pathway of public-private collaboration that could be reinforce and apply after the crisis is gone.",
