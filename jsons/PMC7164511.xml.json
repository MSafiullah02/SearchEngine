A complete understanding of pulmonary fluid mechanics and particle transport at the alveolar level is necessary to improve the assessment of the toxicological impact of harmful inhaled particulate matter such as smoke. Such information can also benefit the pharmaceutical industry by providing key insights for the design and delivery methods of inhaled therapeutics.",

The acini begin at the 17th generation and differ from the conducting airways in that the acinar airways are alveolated [(2)]. The acinar airways can be classified into three categories [(2)]: (i) Respiratory bronchioles located in the upper acini extending from the 17th to the 20th generation with one or a few alveoli attached to each bronchiole, (ii) Alveolar ducts extending from the 21st to the 23rd generation with a higher density of alveoli attached to each bronchiole, and (iii) Alveolar sacs which are clusters of alveoli located at the terminus of the acinar tree.",

Also, the alveolar size changes with age and height [(3),4], especially for infants whose airway structure and alveoli size/shape change considerably during the first 18 months [(3),5]. Due to successive bifurcation, the flow velocity magnitude also decreases as the bronchiole diameter decreases from the upper to lower acini. As a result, the associated geometric, and dynamic parameters such as Reynolds and Womersley numbers, also vary along the acinar tree [(2)]. The varying parameters affect the local fluid mechanics which in turn cause variations in particle transport and deposition from one generation to the next. The current work focuses on the effect of geometric and dynamic parameters on fluid flow and particle transport in the upper acini (respiratory bronchioles).",

Broadly, two types of acinar models were employed by these researchers: rigid-walled, and flexible-walled/oscillating. Within each type, various approximations to the acinar geometry were used: axisymmetric annular or toroidal alveoli with a central duct [(6),13], a single alveolus attached to a semi-infinite plane [(21)], and honeycomb alveoli and duct [(17)]. We have summarized the key findings of these studies in our previous manuscripts [(22),23]. In this paper, we only discuss the literature pertaining to the effect of geometric or dynamic parameters on acinar fluid mechanics and particle transport.",

St and H are the only two dimensionless numbers relevant to this problem. If these two numbers are matched between the in vitro model and the actual in vivo alveolus, then all of the particle dynamics will be accurately reproduced. For all dp < 5 \u03bcm particles St is small enough that we can ignore inertial impaction (See Table 1). The particle trajectory can be obtained by integrating Eq. 3; a second order Runge-Kutta method was used to calculate particle trajectories. The particle location at the (t + 1) time step can be written as:\n5xpt+1=xpt+12[upt(xpt)+upt+1(xpt+1)]dtHere dt is the time step, upt is particle velocity, and xpt is particle location at time = t. The particle tracking algorithm described here assumes that the particle loading is small enough that the particles do not influence the fluid velocities (one-way coupling).",

Although the fractional volumetric change in the alveolus during expansion/contraction was kept constant at the baseline value of 50%, the absolute volumetric change is smaller for \u03b2 = 0.5. Therefore, the velocities during peak inhalation/exhalation are smaller as well (Figs. 2a\na, 2b\nb, 4a\na, and 4b\nb). Likewise, the velocities associated with the primary vortex rings also decrease with \u03b2 due to the smaller amplitude of the alveolar wall motion (Figs. 3a\na, 3b\nb, 5a\na, and 5b\nb). For the larger \u03b2 value, a secondary, weaker vortex ring with the opposite rotational sense sits atop the primary vortex ring during transition periods. The smaller volume of the alveolus corresponding to the smaller \u03b2 value causes the secondary vortex ring to disappear in both the transition periods (Figs. 3a\na, 3b\nb, 5a\na, and 5b\nb).

In the absence of the secondary vortex ring for \u03b2 = 0.5, the primary vortex ring has a stronger influence near the deep alveolar wall due to which particle deposition is higher. Furthermore, although the velocities inside the alveolus increase with \u03b2, the proportionality constant is not strictly linear (Figs. 2a\na and 2b\nb through 5a\n5b\na\nb). The smaller alveolar size implies that particles need to travel a shorter distance in order to deposit, especially when the particle settling velocity due to gravity is superposed. As a result, the overall particle deposition time decreases and deposition increases for smaller \u03b2.",

As before, these values of fractional volumetric change in the alveolus (\u0394V/V) are in good agreement with physiological values in the upper acini. Note that a change in \u0394V/V may change \u03b2 by a few percent which is small compared to the variation in \u03b2 (23%) considered in the previous section. The flow topology during the complete breathing cycle remains similar for different \u0394V/V similar to the cases for varying \u03b2 (see Sec. 3). Furthermore, a pair of vortex rings was observed for all \u0394V/V values during both transition periods. Also, the flow is symmetric during peak inhalation/exhalation and transition from exhalation to inhalation, and slightly asymmetric during transition from inhalation to exhalation for all \u0394V/V values (Parts (a), (g), (h) in Figs. 2\n3\n4\n5).",

A small fraction of these particles leaves the alveolus in at most four cycles while others either remain suspended or deposit on the alveolar wall. In contrast, the small velocities associated with \u0394V/V = 0.25 are unable to advect a reasonable portion of particles during the first cycle. Consequently, the fraction of suspended particles is smaller and deposition is low. By this argument, the deposition is expected to be higher for \u0394V/V = 0.65 but in fact, the deposition is small again which can be explained as follows: during transition periods the vortex rings enhance particle transport and deposition into the alveolus. For \u0394V/V = 0.65, the recirculation region is small because the alveolus is small during transition from exhalation to inhalation (Fig. 5h\nh). Therefore, the particle transport is smaller compared to the baseline case (\u0394V/V = 0.5) and lowers particle deposition.",

During peak inhalation the shear layer formation is promoted by the alveolar expansion. Consequently, the rapid bronchiole flow (dataset 3, Re = 0.8) causes a tilt in the peak velocities towards the bronchiole flow direction (right side, Fig. 2d\nd). In contrast, the influence of the bronchiole fluid motion is suppressed by large outward velocities during peak exhalation. Therefore, the bronchiole fluid is unable to alter the flow inside the alveolus. On the other hand, the flow asymmetry developed during transition from inhalation to exhalation continues to survive until peak exhalation due to a lack of adequate damping (Fig. 5d\nd). Furthermore, since the peak exhalation is unable to damp out the asymmetry developed during transition from inhalation to exhalation, this asymmetry continues through transition from exhalation to inhalation as observed in Fig. 5d\nd.",

In contrast, more particles remain suspended for Re = 0.1 due to a lower recirculation in this case ((a2)\u2013(d2) in Figs. 6\n7). As Re is increased to 0.8, the velocity field becomes significantly asymmetric during both transition periods (Figs. 3c\nc and 5c\nc).

Hence, particle deposition is lowest for Re = 0.8 for both massless and dp = 1.5 \u03bcm particles in all three gravity orientations ((a3)\u2013(d3) in Figs. 6\n7).

Furthermore, the asymmetry is significantly stronger during transition from exhalation to inhalation compared to the other transition period for \u03b1 = 0.15 (compare Figs. 3f\nf and 5f\nf). In fact, during transition from exhalation to inhalation, the left circulation suppresses the right circulation, merges with the shear layer, and occupies almost the entire alveolar volume. During peak inhalation/exhalation, a small \u03b1 causes a shift in the largest inward/outward towards the bronchiole flow direction.

In fact, \u03b1 = 0.15 represents 4 and 8 times slower expansion/contraction compared to \u03b1 = 0.3 and 0.42, respectively. Consequently, the velocities induced by the alveolar wall motion are significantly smaller for the smaller \u03b1 value. In contrast, the bronchiole flow for all \u03b1 remains unchanged (Re = 0.2). As a result, the bronchiole flow-induced velocities overwhelm velocities caused by the alveolar wall motion and the vortex rings become highly asymmetric.

On the other hand, the deposition sites remain unaffected as \u03b1 is decreased from 0.42 to 0.3 but become fewer for an even smaller \u03b1 (=0.15). As previously noticed, the velocity maps and the particle deposition sites are quite similar for \u03b1 = 0.42 and 0.3 ((a4)\u2013(d4), (a5)\u2013(d5) in Figs. 6\n7). However, higher inhalation velocities in combination with higher recirculation velocities for \u03b1 = 0.42 (see (d) and (e) in Figs. 2\n3\n4\n5) push more particles into the alveolus resulting in greater particle deposition and a higher fraction of suspended particles ((a4)\u2013(d4), (a5)\u2013(d5) in Figs. 6\n7). When \u03b1 is reduced to 0.15, the overall flow topology changes (compare Figs. 3f\nf and 5f\nf with 3d\nd and 3e\ne and 5d\nd and 5e\ne), i.e., the secondary vortex ring and the shear layer disappear and the primary vortex ring becomes highly asymmetric.
