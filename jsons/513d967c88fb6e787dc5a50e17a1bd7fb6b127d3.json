This pneumonia outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus, a lipid-enveloped RNA virus, which was named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) [2] . The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-2019 . The virus outbreak presumably originated via a zoonotic transmission linked to the seafood market in Wuhan (China) and later accelerated with human to human transmission, causing the severe subsequent outbreak [1] . Since the original outbreak, SARS-CoV2 has rapidly spread across the world and, in January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global public health emergency [3] . By the 21st of April 2020, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f more than 2.4 million individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV2, and it had caused more than 165,000 deaths [4] .",
