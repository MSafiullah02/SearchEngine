It has also become apparent that the 'virulence' of bacterial strains may also depend on the presence of transmissible genes contained in plasmids or mediated by bacteriophage. The adhesiveness to the ileal mucosa of an E. coli strain that produces enteritis in pigs is dependent on the presence of the K88 capsular antigen, a factor which is plasmid mediated. Enterotoxin production by this E. coli strain is also dependent on the presence of the appropriate plasmid. In man, the toxins produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae and the erythrogenic toxin produced by Strep, pyogenes strains in scarlet fever patients are dependent on genes mediated by temperate phages. The fact that particular microbes appear to be more or less virulent at different times, might be due in part to the presence or absence of these types of transmissible genes.
