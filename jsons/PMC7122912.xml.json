For the purposes of this discussion, biothreats consist of pathogens, viruses, and toxins. Examples of naturally occurring biothreats include emerging infectious diseases, infections that often appear unexpectedly and have the potential to spread through a population or increase in severity of each incidence. Recent outbreaks include a highly contagious African viral hemorrhagic fever (Ebola) in 1974, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States in 1993, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [1]. Biothreats with relevance to defense concerns include ricin, anthrax, and botulinum.",

A flow-patterning process developed by the authors at NRL was used to pattern capture antibodies. A standard sandwich assay format was designed to rely on fluorescence reporting of analyte concentration in a sample. Excitation light was incident on the end of the waveguide to generate an evanescent excitation of the surface-bound fluorescent detection antibodies. Evanescent wave techniques enable rapid response time and relative insensitivity to complex biological matrices. Relying upon detection of fluorescent signal eliminates confounding signal arising from nonspecific adsorption. Furthermore, the narrow penetration depth (100\u2013200 nm) of evanescent waves allows detection of events occurring on the surface only, with little signal from the bulk solution. Real-time measurements of turbid or inhomogeneous samples are possible. A two-dimensional graded index of the refraction lens array allowed imaging of the surface using a CCD camera.",

Again, a sandwich format was employed in conjunction with fluorescence detection. An automated version of the array flow sensor was introduced. In the reported study, improvements regarding the optical coupling of the waveguide and flow cell assembly to the detector were made by incorporating a patterned reflective silver-based cladding to optically decouple the waveguide and the flow cell. Detection of bacterial analytes (B. anthracis (Stern), Francisella tularensis LVS, Brucella abortus) and toxins (Botulinum toxoids A and B, S. aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), ricin, and cholera toxin) was reported. Although the sensitivity of the semiautomated system was compatible with immunosensors, the sensitivity was dependent on the type of antibody used (i.e., monoclonal vs. polyclonal). An automated version of the array biosensor suffered from fivefold less sensitivity, mainly arising from higher variation in background signal attributed by the authors to fluorescence arising from materials used in the flow cell.",

To immobilize the model receptors on maleimide-modified glass slides, the sugars were converted to anomeric thi-ophenyl glycosides containing para-hydroxyl thiophenol. An acid linker was added and coupled to a thioacetate terminating linker. The monosaccharide array was constructed using a flow pattering approach similar to that described previously, albeit with a 12-channel PDMS patterning template.

Results of dose\u2013response studies with cholera and tetanus toxins showed a carbohydrate density dependence on the observed semiselective binding of these two toxins to the carbohydrates.
