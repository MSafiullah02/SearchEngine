            "text": "In 1997 the Rhinosinusitis Task Force published the first definitions and guidelines for the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis in the otolaryngological literature. In general, rhinosinusitis was defined as a manifestation of an inflammatory response involving the mucous membranes of the sinonasal cavities with or without involvement of the underlying bone. As such, it manifests with symptoms and physical findings over a particular timeframe. To establish a consistent definition among all health care professionals treating patients, major and minor criteria incorporating these symptoms and physical findings were established (see Chapter 1, Table 1.1). A time factor was thought necessary to distinguish various forms of rhinosinusitis including acute, subacute, and chronic. Therefore, acute rhinosinusitis was defined by a sudden onset with symptoms lasting no more than 4 weeks, while subacute rhinosinusitis encompassed symptoms lasting for 4 to 12 weeks (thought to reflect acute rhinosinusitis that had not completely resolved itself). Finally, chronic rhinosinusitis was defined by symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks with either two or more major factors or one major and two minor factors [1].",

Since the original attempt to clinically define rhinosinusitis in 1997, the guidelines have been enhanced to make them more useful. In the 2007 clinical practice guidelines, acute rhinosinusitis was further subdivided\u2014based on symptom pattern\u2014into acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and viral rhinosinusitis (VRS), which are further discussed under \u201cPresenting Symptoms and Signs [2]. \u201d",

Symptom-free intervals must also exist if the problem is intermittent in nature.

Predisposing factors such as allergy, trauma, dental infection, nasal anatomy, and systemic diseases (e.g., vasculitis, granulomatous disease, or immunodeficient states) contribute to the frequency and severity of symptoms. The most common virus implicated in acute rhinosinusitis is human rhinovirus, followed by coronavirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus. Once the virus attaches to epithelial cells, there is an upregulation of inflammatory pathways resulting in the production of histamine, bradykinin, and various cytokines. A downstream effect of this inflammation is the suppression of macrophage and lymphocyte function, which creates a milieu susceptible to bacterial infection and overgrowth [4,5].",

Female respondents were nearly twice as likely to have the diagnosis; and it was also more common in the South than in other regions of the country [7].

Alho and colleagues examined 48 individuals during the first days of a viral upper respiratory infection [13]. Evaluation included a paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) scan at the initial evaluation and then again after 21 days. The individuals with allergic rhinitis (19%) had significantly poorer CT scan results when compared with nonallergic subjects both initially and at follow-up.

            "text": "With the advent of sinonasal endoscopy, a more directed and less invasive culture technique was introduced. One of the early studies evaluating endoscopic middle meatal cultures (EMMC) was performed by Vogan and colleagues in 2000 [17]. EMMC and antral puncture were performed on 16 individuals presenting with symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis and maxillary sinus air-fluid levels on CT. This group reported a concordance rate of 93.8% for aerobic culture and 87.4% for anaerobic culture [17]. Further support for the validity of EMMC was demonstrated by two meta-analyses, the first in 2005 by Dubin et al., that revealed accuracy of 82% per isolate when compared with maxillary sinus aspirates [18]. Benninger and colleagues then described a sensitivity of 80.9% and specificity of 90.5%, a positive predictive value of 82.6%, a negative predictive value of 89.4%, and an overall accuracy of 87% of EMMC [19].",

Only an ESR more than 20 mm/h in females and more than 10 mm/h in males, as well as a CRP more than 10 mg/l, were significantly associated with the correct diagnosis [20].

Waters\u2019 (occipitomental) view, where the X-ray beam is oriented through the chin, is used to obtain views of the maxillary and frontal sinuses. In the Caldwell view, the X-ray beam is oriented directly through the forehead and is used to evaluate the frontal sinus. In one report, the sensitivity and specificity are somewhat modest at 76% and 79%, respectively [23]. When evaluating the efficacy of using a single Waters\u2019 view for diagnosing acute maxillary versus frontal rhinosinusitis, the accuracy has been shown to be even worse. When evaluating the maxillary sinus, a single Waters\u2019 view has a false-negative rate of 32% and a mean negative predictive value of 76.9%; and the sensitivity for evaluating the frontal sinus is only 14.6% when compared to CT. Radiologists in this study also could not commit to a diagnosis when evaluating the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, indicating that this modality is not adequate for the evaluation of these sinuses [24,25]. Figures 3.2 and 3.3 are plain X-rays of Caldwell and Waters views demonstrating mucosal thickening. These images reveal how the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis from X-ray can be difficult. Structural overlapping can lead to the impression of edematous mucosa, a hypoplastic sinus can be misinterpreted as pathological opacification, and infection can be difficult to distinguish from tumor and polyp.\n\n\n",

In 2002, Stankiewicz and Chow sought to determine the relationship between symptoms (as defined by the 1997 Rhinology task force), nasal endoscopy, and CT scan [33]. They found that neither endoscopy nor CT scanning correlated with the symptoms-based criteria for CRS, as more than 50% and 68% of patients who met the criteria for CRS had negative CT scans and normal endoscopic examinations. However, they did find that if purulence, polyps, or polypoid congested mucosa were present on endoscopy, sinus disease was usually present on the CT scan and that a negative endoscopic exam was a relatively good predictor of a negative CT scan [33].",

We also believe that, given the poor sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging, there is little role for this modality in the diagnosis of uncomplicated rhinosinusitis. Endoscopic evaluation on the other hand, if available, should be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis and should be considered before imaging.
