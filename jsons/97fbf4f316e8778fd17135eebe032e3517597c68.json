There is an increasing preponderance of medicine-first trainees and herein lies our first opportunity. For dental and medical students, exposure to OMFS is minimal and it is mainly serendipity that provides students with an insight into our specialty. Those units actively engaging with their local medical and/or dental school provide a valuable preview of OMFS. From an undergraduate training perspective, we offer J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f excellent opportunities for head and neck examination, the (often overlooked) oral cavity, dental assessment, and broad-based operative observation. Students from either specialty have the opportunity to cover multiple aspects of their syllabus including trauma, head and neck cancer, and oral medicine, amongst others.",

Improving these without causing detriment to our surgical repertoire would considerably ameliorate training in OMFS. Three-year medical programmes for dentists exist, yet only one UK dental school offers a corresponding three-year course. Expanding these places for all trainees would overcome a major obstacle in the training pathway. Second-degree students often do other work alongside the rigour of intensive, shortened degrees. OMFS departments are vital in supporting students ensuring they maintain flexibility of studying, supporting themselves financially and remaining linked to OMFS by maintaining their undergraduate-attained medical or dental skill set.",
