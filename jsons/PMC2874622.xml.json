            "text": "The mammalian innate immune system acts as the first line of defense against microbial attack. On encountering viral or bacterial intruders, this system activates numerous signaling pathways that result in the production of anti-microbial compounds designed to mitigate damage, in effect by preventing both the replication and spread of the pathogen. Initiation of an immune response relies on numerous pattern-recognition proteins (PRPs) \u2013 a group of proteins shared by animals and plants (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002) \u2013 which recognize the molecular markers of invaders (e.g. dsRNA, lipopolysaccharide, unmethylated CpG DNA) and signal to downstream members of the immune system. PRPs can be placed into two general groups, based on where they function. Extracellular pathogens are recognized by the toll-like receptor (TLR) proteins, which are either expressed on the cell membrane facing the extracellular matrix, or in endosomes (reviewed in Kawai and Akira, 2006). Once a pathogen is bound the TLR proteins signal through cytoplasmic adapter proteins, such as TRIF and MyD88, to initiate the production of nuclear encoded pro-immune cytokines. Intracellular pathogens are recognized by several groups of PRPs, including protein kinase R (PKR), the NOD-like protein family, and the more recently-identified RIG-I-like helicase (RLH) pathway (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002, Meylan and Tschopp, 2008, Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009). The RLH pathway is composed of three RNA helicase proteins which bind virally-produced nucleic acids, and a number of downstream signaling molecules (Fig. 1\n). The prototypic member of the family is RIG-I, a protein which consists of twin N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment (CARD) domains, and a C-terminal RNA helicase domain (Yoneyama et al., 2004). RIG-I binds viral dsRNA at its helicase domain, which stimulates a conformational change that exposes the twin CARD domains, to allow downstream signaling through direct protein:protein interactions. The other two helicases are MDA-5, which is similar in structure and function to RIG-I, but which recognizes other viral substrates; and LGP2, which has a homologous helicase domain, but lacks the CARD domains and can act as a negative regulator of RLH signaling during infection by certain viruses, particularly those sensed by RIG-I (Yoneyama et al., 2004, Venkataraman et al., 2007, Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009).",

            "text": "In the year following the identification of RIG-I, four groups simultaneously reported a novel member of the RLH signaling pathway, with each group choosing a different name for the new protein. Kawai et al. (2005) found Interferon-\u03b2 Promoter Stimulator 1 (IPS-1) by screening multiple cDNA pools for novel inducers of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. They reported that IPS-1 could activate the pro-immune transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NF-\u03baB to induce type 1 interferon production, and that it interacted with RIG-I and MDA-5 through its CARD domain. Xu et al. (2005) made expression constructs of 12 unknown cDNAs from a previous study that had identified a large number of novel NK-\u03baB activators (Matsuda et al., 2003). In their system, Virus-triggered IFN-\u03b2 Signaling (VISA) was the only one of these cDNAs to significantly induce NK-\u03baB signaling (Xu et al., 2005). Using a combination of mammalian coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies, they found that VISA interacted with both TRAF2 and TRAF6, potentially implicating it in TLR-mediated pathways (Xu et al., 2005). Meylan et al. (2005) found CARD Adaptor Inducing IFN-\u03b2 (CARDIF) using bioinformatic searches for novel CARD domain proteins. They showed that it could recruit the signaling kinases IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and IKK\u03b5, which led to the activation of the IRF3 and NK-\u03baB transcription factors. The authors also employed an in vitro system to demonstrate that CARDIF is cleaved by a protease encoded by the hepatitis C virus, showing for the first time that viruses could specifically disrupt CARDIF signaling (Meylan et al., 2005). Finally, Seth et al. (2005) discovered the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein (MAVS) by performing sequence similarity searches, using the CARD domain of MDA-5 as bait. They reported that overexpression of MAVS activated IRF3 and NK-\u03baB, and that its presence was required for a response to Sendai virus infection. Importantly, only Seth et al. (2005) in these primary papers localized this novel protein to mitochondria, therefore for this reason (and general simplicity) IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF/MAVS will be referred to as \u2018\u2018MAVS\u2019\u2019 below.",

            "text": "MAVS is a predicted 57 kDa protein consisting of three functional domains \u2013 a single N-terminal CARD domain (10\u201377 aa), a medial proline-rich region (PRR; 107\u2013173 aa) and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM; 514\u2013535 aa) that anchors it to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Seth et al., 2005). The N-terminal CARD domain shares high similarity to the CARD domains found in RIG-I and MDA-5 (Potter et al., 2008), and these proteins are predicted to bind with MAVS homotypically at this domain, following activation by viruses. As such, removal of the MAVS CARD domain appears to prevent this interaction and ablates its signaling function (Seth et al., 2005, Meylan et al., 2005, Kawai et al., 2005). The PRR section of MAVS contains consensus binding sites for many proline-associated immune proteins, such as members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF) family like TRAF2, TRAF3 and TRAF6 (Xu et al., 2005, Saha et al., 2006). In the context of this review, perhaps the most interesting domain however is the C-terminal TM domain that directs MAVS to mitochondria. Removal of the TM prevents both its mitochondrial localization and signaling function, restricting the truncated protein to the cytosol (Seth et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2005). The TM domain has similarities to those found in the outer mitochondrial membrane proteins TOM20, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and replacing the TM of MAVS with those from Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL restores both its function and mitochondrial localization (Seth et al., 2005). This suggests that the TM domain of MAVS has no other role in the antiviral function of the protein, other than to ensure correct placement at the outer mitochondrial membrane. When overexpressed, a construct containing just the CARD and TM domains of MAVS had a similar ability to activate the IFN-\u03b2 promoter as the whole protein (Seth et al., 2005), indicating that these two domains are the most important for MAVS function.",

            "text": "There have been several (sometimes conflicting) reports of proteins that interact with MAVS, either to aid downstream signaling, or to regulate its function. Downstream signaling, resulting in the production of cytokines, has been linked to a number of pathways that converge on the pro-immune transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NF-\u03baB. MAVS has been shown to associate with FADD and RIP1 (Matsuda et al., 2003, Lad et al., 2008), adapter proteins involved in the IKK complex that activates NF-\u03baB. However, the requirement for RIP1 in MAVS-associated cytokine production is questioned by the finding that there is normal IFN-\u03b2 activation in RIP1\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Seth et al., 2005). Binding of TRAF-family members (e.g. TRAF2, TRAF3 and TRAF6) to the proline-rich region of MAVS has been shown to be necessary for the downstream phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3/7 (Seth et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2005, Saha et al., 2006), although a deletion-mutant of MAVS without the binding sites still has the capacity to activate IFN-\u03b2 (Seth et al., 2005). Kinases such as IKK\u03b5, have been shown to physically interact with MAVS at the outer mitochondrial membrane (Lin et al., 2006), and this leads to the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3. In contrast, the mitotic polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) has been shown to inhibit MAVS signaling and IFN-\u03b2 activation, by blocking the TRAF3 binding site on MAVS in a phospho-independent manner (Vitour et al., 2009).",

A subunit of the proteasome, PSMA7, interacts with MAVS in vivo and in vitro, and its overexpression leads to a reduction in endogenous MAVS levels (Jia et al., 2009). Importantly, there is also a transient increase in PSMA7 levels during viral infection, indicating that the MAVS degradation is not just experimental artifact. Potentially upstream of this protein is PCBP2, which interacts with MAVS and acts as a negative regulator of its function (You et al., 2009). PCBP2 is upregulated during viral infection, and appears to target MAVS for degradation via the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system. Following viral infection, PCBP2 recruits the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 to MAVS, resulting in its polyubiquitination and degradation (You et al., 2009).",

            "text": "A familiar aspect of mitochondrial biology is the role the organelle plays in apoptosis. Mitochondria are an integral part of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, being the location of many proteins involved in the early stages of cell death. For example, the Bcl-2 family of proteins (including the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak, and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) act at the outer mitochondrial membrane in response to stress stimuli, and help to regulate whether the cell enters the later stages of programmed cell death (for review, see Youle and Strasser, 2008). If the cell receives sufficient pro-apoptotic signals, Bax and Bak aid the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter membrane space, which leads to the induction of caspases and the orderly destruction of the cell. Apoptosis is also an important aspect of the immune system, as it can help to prevent the movement of pathogens between tissues, and many viruses (such as human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus) produce proteins that interfere with this process (Boya et al., 2003). For example, the 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase/RNaseL pathway induces apoptosis in response to viral infection, by using the endoribonuclease RNaseL to cleave all cellular RNA (host and viral), which shuts down protein synthesis and kills the cell (Castelli et al., 1998, Malathi et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Given the role that MAVS may play in immune-related apoptosis, it is perhaps unsurprising that the protein is heavily regulated during apoptosis. Upstream members of the RLH pathway such as RIG-I and MDA-5 are degraded by caspases during apoptosis which, in the case of MDA-5, can be induced by poliovirus infection (Barral et al., 2007, Scott, 2009). MAVS is cleaved at Asp-429 by caspases during apoptosis, a process which can be blocked by the addition of the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, or expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (Scott and Norris, 2008, Rebsamen et al., 2008). Cleavage of these proteins during the early stages of cell death has the potential to aid viral replication, as it may prevent RLH proteins from signaling to downstream immune proteins, or delay completion of the apoptotic program. Initial studies of MDA-5 cleavage during poliovirus infection did not detect a benefit to the invading virus from inducing apoptosis, as there were no increases in viral replication or reduction in cytokine production (Barral et al., 2007). However, a recent study by Lei et al. (2009) has provided direct evidence of a viral protein targeting MAVS-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic SARS-CoV protein NSP15 prevents apoptosis as a result of MAVS expression, but does not mediate apoptosis induced by staurosporine treatment, indicating that it has evolved as a MAVS-specific strategy (Lei et al., 2009). Further studies will help to elucidate the extent to which viruses target this interferon-independent aspect of MAVS biology.",

These leucine-rich repeat proteins are receptors involved in sensing numerous pathogen markers, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB; and also as part of the inflammasome complexes which regulate caspase-1 activation and production of inflammatory cytokines (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002, O\u2019Neill, 2008). Recently two research groups characterized a new member of the family, NLRX1, which was found to have a mitochondrial localization, in contrast to the cytosolic nature of the other family members. Moore et al. (2008) reported that NLRX1 was targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane by a putative N-terminal localization sequence (Fig. 2\n), and had the ability to down-regulate RLH signaling by interacting with MAVS. This regulation was hypothesized to act as a brake on MAVS function, with the NACHT domain of NLRX1 reversibly binding to the CARD domain of MAVS \u2013 in effect blocking its ability to interact with RIG-I or MDA-5 (Moore et al., 2008). The second group also implicated NLRX1 in innate immunity, however with a greatly contrasting function. Tattoli et al. (2008) demonstrated that the mitochondrial localization of NLRX1 was dependent on a N-terminal addressing sequence, and that its expression did not lead to direct NF-\u03baB activation. However, it was shown that NLRX1 could amplify reactive oxygen species production in response to Shigella infection and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, which led to an increase in pro-immune NF-\u03baB and JUN kinase signaling (Tattoli et al., 2008).",

While these may be accounted for by differences in experimental model or cell type, further research was required to elucidate NLRX1 function. Both groups reported that NLRX1 had a N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, a feature which is normally associated with proteins that are imported into mitochondria via membrane translocases, as opposed to outer membrane proteins, which tend to have internal localization markers (Wiedemann et al., 2004). A thorough biochemical analysis of NLRX1 in HeLa and HEK293 cells indicated that NLRX1 is indeed imported into the mitochondrial matrix, a process which requires the removal of the N-terminal pre-sequence and an intact transmembrane potential (Arnoult et al., 2009). In addition, the authors demonstrated that NLRX1 coimmunoprecipitates with UQCRC2, a subunit of the respiratory chain complex III, which is localized on the matrix-facing side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. As complex III is involved in reactive oxygen species production, this finding substantiates both the matrix localization of NLRX1, and its involvement in reactive oxygen signaling (Arnoult et al., 2009).",

STING/MITA was discovered simultaneously by two independent groups, and has been shown to interact with both RIG-I and MAVS (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008, Zhong et al., 2008). While both groups showed that it was required for downstream RLH-pathway signaling (by connecting upstream activator proteins like MAVS to downstream signaling kinases), and that it could activate reporter constructs for immune proteins like ISRE, they differed on the localization of the protein. Using similar techniques, the same protein was localized to mitochondria (MITA) and the endoplasmic reticulum (STING) by biochemical and microscopical analysis (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008, Zhong et al., 2008). Recent studies from two other groups have strengthened the case for the endoplasmic reticulum localization of STING/MITA (Sun et al., 2009, Castanier et al., in press); and it has been shown further that STING/MITA is involved in the response to intracellular viral DNA produced by herpes simplex-1 virus, where it translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (with the signaling kinase TBK-1) to perinuclear vesicles during infection (Ishikawa et al., 2009). While these data suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum localization of STING/MITA is correct, there are many regions of close apposition between this organelle and mitochondria, known as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs; Vance, 1990), which can make unequivocal findings difficult. It is likely that these MAMs are important regions for the interaction between MAVS and STING/MITA (Castanier et al., in press).",

However, several previous papers have shown that gC1qR is imported into the mitochondrial matrix using a N-terminal localization sequence (Muta et al., 1997, Dedio et al., 1998), which would keep it away from MAVS under physiological conditions.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, undergoing constant fission and fusion in many cell types, and a balance between these two processes controls the overall mitochondrial morphology in any individual cell (for review, see Suen et al., 2008). A recent study has shown that there is an interaction between MAVS and Mfn2, a dynamin-like GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion (Yasukawa et al., 2009), demonstrating the first potential connection between mitochondrial morphology and immunity. Overexpression of Mfn2 blocked MAVS signaling, while knockdown of the endogenous protein increased interferon production during viral infection, indicating that Mfn2 may act as a negative regulator of the RLH pathway. However, the authors suggested that the Mfn2-MAVS link may be separate from the role of Mfn2 in mitochondrial fusion (Yasukawa et al., 2009).",

Altering mitochondrial morphology, by down-regulating mitochondrial fission and fusion genes using RNAi, regulated the antiviral response to Sendai virus infection. In cells with depleted mitochondrial fission (which led to elongated mitochondria), there was enhanced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB promoters during infection; conversely, in cells with fragmented mitochondria (caused by the down-regulation of mitochondrial fusion genes), the antiviral response to infection was attenuated (Castanier et al., in press). The authors further showed that MAVS interacts with, and may regulate, the function of a mitochondrial fusion protein, Mfn1 (a homologue of Mfn2), and that this may be the cause of the observed mitochondrial elongation during infection. Finally, it was demonstrated that the change in mitochondrial morphology aided the interaction between MAVS and STING/MITA on the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that the elongation promotes the physical interaction of the two organelles during the antiviral response (Castanier et al., in press). In summary, it is clear that mitochondrial dynamics may play an important part in MAVS function, and it is likely that we have much more to learn about the role of mitochondrial morphology in this regard.",

The CARD domains on RIG-I can then interact with a similar CARD domain on MAVS, which is localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane, to initiate an immune signaling cascade.

A number of mitochondrial proteins have recently been implicated in the innate immune system, either through interaction with MAVS, or as part of an autonomous pathway. STING (also known as MITA) has been localized to both mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, and may act downstream of RIG-I and MAVS in their initiation of pro-immune signaling kinases. NLRX1 and gC1qR have been implicated as regulators as MAVS function, possibly acting as physical barriers to prevent its interaction with RIG-I. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that the mature forms or both NLRX1 and gC1qR reside in the mitochondrial matrix, making a functional interaction with MAVS less likely. NLRX1 has recently been shown to physically interact with the respiratory chain complex III subunit UQCRC2, suggesting that it may be involved in reactive oxygen species production. Mfn2, an outer mitochondrial GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, has been shown to bind MAVS and negatively regulate immune signaling, raising questions about the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the immune response.",
