Babesiosis is characteristically associated with intravascular hemolytic anemia. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be present, and an elevated LDH value should suggest the possibility of babesiosis. Lymphopenia is common in babesiosis and atypical lymphocytes may be present. Other commonly reported laboratory abnormalities include mild or transient elevations of serum transaminases and subnormal high-density lipoprotein levels [9, 10]. Most patients with an intact spleen recover spontaneously. Symptoms are usually more severe in elderly, immunocompromised or splenectomized hosts. The diagnosis of babesiosis is based on epidemiology and clinical findings and on laboratory data including identification of Babesia spp. on peripheral blood smear, specific IgM and IgG antibody responses or polymerase chain reaction. Babesiosis is usually treated with a combination of clindamycin and quinine or atovaquone and azithromycin. In severe cases involving asplenia, exchange transfusions have been used [9\u201318].",

She was referred for an infectious disease consultation for a questionable tick bite on her lower back, and oral doxycycline (200 mg q12 h) was begun. Her blood work at the time revealed a leukocyte count of 4.2 k/mm3, a hemoglobin level of 16 g/dl, a hematocrit value of 50%, and normal serum LDH. Her transaminases were within normal limits and her antinuclear antibodies were positive at 1:160 (speckled pattern).

In patients with intact splenic function, babesiosis is usually mild; with treatment, it resolves without complications. Pulmonary complications are rare and may be related to fluid overload from exchange transfusions or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. To the best of our knowledge, the case presented here is the most recent of only 16 reported in the literature to date. Our patient was an elderly splenectomized woman whose course was complicated by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema during her hospitalization. In spite of her asplenic status and the case being complicated by a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, she made a successful recovery. She had a prolonged course of infection, as evidenced by the slow decline in her LDH level, as well as her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels over time; this was ascribed to her lack of splenic function [8, 16\u201318].",
