Nevertheless, a number of reports have been published highlighting CT appearances in COVID-19, raising the possibility of a role for CT in patient management.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In response to these reports, the BSTI published a preliminary consensus statement on 6 March 2020.6 We discuss below what role, if any, CT would play in the detection and management of COVID-19 infection in the UK, and the logistics of imaging delivery. This role is heavily predicated on the clinical context as well as the timing of its intended use within the diagnostic pathway, especially relative to the current reference standard diagnostic test, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a pharyngeal swab,7 and other clinical and laboratory investigations. Although it may not be feasible or desirable for isolation purposes to perform a chest radiograph (CXR), we should acknowledge that pragmatically patients with a respiratory complaint are likely to present via any number of routes (primary care, emergency departments [EDs] or outpatient clinics) having already had a CXR, other than to isolation pods outside a hospital, and work-up of a respiratory complaint would usually include a CXR in such settings. Cognizant of this fact, in the following discussion we have considered how a CXR would also fit into diagnostic algorithms, and in particular, how the use of CT would alter management in settings where a CXR was or was not available.",

False-negative results may arise for a number of reasons including inadequate sampling technique or low viral load and thus many patients will require multiple testing to exclude the diagnosis. Ai et al. found that of 64 patients with initially negative RT-PCR testing, 15/64 (23.4%) had subsequent positive RT-PCR (mean time interval 5.1\u00b10.5 days). Ten of these patients (i.e., only 15.6% of those with initial negative RT-PCR) had typical features on CT at the time of initial negative RT-PCR.5 Fang et al. described a 29.4% rate of CT abnormality in patients with initially negative and subsequently positive RT-PCR.2 As such, in the minority of patients with high clinical suspicion but negative initial RT-PCR, the presence of typical CT appearances, such as peripheral ground-glass opacity, could be used to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 infection, until such time as multiple negative testing is sufficient to exclude or change the diagnosis.",

A study by Xiong et al. offers a compelling argument for such a strategy: in their analysis of 42 patients, clinical findings and white blood cell count were not well-correlated with initial CT findings, but CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly moderately to strongly correlated with the extent and severity of overall involvement and the size of the largest CT lesion.10\n",

At the time of writing, we are aware of only two publications on the subject. Hu et al.\n20 evaluated the laboratory and CT characteristics of 24 asymptomatic close contacts who were COVID-19 carriers, as confirmed by RT-PCR. Seventeen of 24 (70.8%) had CT abnormalities, with 12 (50% of total) showing typical peripheral ground-glass opacity. The minority had lymphopenia (16.8%) and elevated CRP (17.4%). The 17 patients with CT abnormalities were older (median age 38 versus 14 years old, p=0.012). A more recent analysis by Inui et al of 112 RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the cruise ship \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d demonstrated CT abnormalities in only 44/82 (54%) asymptomatic cases (reference https://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200110). In combination, this reinforces the unsuitability of CT in isolation as a screening tool for this subgroup. Even if CT were to be used to screen close contacts, we cannot envisage the practical value of such a strategy, compared to serial RT-PCR testing (as long as the latter is available), given that such contacts would be advised to self-isolate. In addition, the specificity of CT or RT-PCR for screening asymptomatic contacts in this manner is undefined.",
