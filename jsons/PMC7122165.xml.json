            "text": "Very often in research projects, there is interest in mapping the protein\u2013protein interactions of a protein of interest as a way of understanding its function in the cell or virus. While a variety of techniques exist for this purpose, such as yeast two-hybrid screening, mass spectrometry, and protein complementation assays, another approach is the use of phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries. In such an approach, one takes a purified, recombinant protein and isolates peptide ligands to it through affinity selection (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the phage-displayed peptides bind at \u201chot spots\u201d for molecular interaction and very often share the same primary structure as short regions within cellular interacting proteins. Several examples where this approach has proven useful include such targets as protein interacting domains [1, 2].\n",

            "text": "To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we describe its application to two targets, human protein tyrosine kinase, Lyn, and the yeast serine/threonine-protein kinase Cbk1. Lyn was first discovered as a viral oncogene [3] and later appreciated to be a proto-oncogene in humans. It is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, which is a member of the Src family of proteins. It has a modular architecture: a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, several linker regions, and a catalytic domain that phosphorylate tyrosines in proteins [4]. The SH3 domain plays a role in mediating protein\u2013protein interactions and has been described to bind proline-rich motifs in proteins. The Cbk1 belongs to a large family of NDR/LATS protein kinases, which is conserved across eukaryotes and includes members such as myotonic dystrophy kinase [5]. Cbk1 plays a role in controlling cell separation after cytokinesis, cell integrity, and polarized growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [6]. To date, only a few substrates of Cbk1 have been reported. One of them, Ace2, a transcription factor that is activated by Cbk1 via three phosphorylation sites [7], is responsible for transcriptional control of enzymes required for septum degradation after cytokinesis [6]. The other, Ssd1, is an RNA-binding protein that suppresses translation of certain mRNAs and which loses activity when phosphorylated by Cbk1 [8].",

To maintain optimum sterility and eliminate carryover, only filtered tips should be used throughout the selection procedure.\nAdd 20 \u03bcL of glutathione magnetic bead slurry (5 \u03bcL of settled beads) into 2 mL Eppendorf Tube, and wash twice with 600 \u03bcL of ice-cold wash buffer #1 (PBS) on magnetic separator. Remove the supernatant.Resuspend the beads in 600 \u03bcL of wash buffer #1 with 20 \u03bcg of the GST fusion protein.

Wash three times with 800 \u03bcL of ice-cold wash buffer #2 (PBST). Remove supernatant, add 800 \u03bcL of ice-cold wash buffer #1, and transfer into a new 2 mL Eppendorf Tube to eliminate any plastic-bound phage.Repeat the washing step two more times with wash buffer #1.

Incubate for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C without shaking. Add 5 mL of 2 \u00d7 YT medium, and incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator (approximately 240 rpm). Keep remaining phage at 4 \u00b0C as a stock of selection-isolated phage clones (see\nNote\n4).To perform two additional rounds of selection, repeat steps 4 through 9. Spin down the overnight cultures to pellet the cells. Use 200 \u03bcL of fresh overnight-amplified phage supernatant (step 4).(Optional). A quality control (polyclonal) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be performed to verify if the subsequent steps of selection were successful. Use the remaining overnight-amplified phage supernatant from round 2 and 3 and follow steps 1\u201310 in Subheading 3.2.Following the final round of selection, perform serial dilutions of the eluted phage in the range from 10\u22122 to 10\u22126 and mix 10 \u03bcL of each dilution (final range: 10\u22124\u201310\u22128), with 400 \u03bcL of fresh mid-log TG1 cells.

            "text": "For the purpose of this protocol, a modified M13 phage vector containing an amber stop codon has to be first obtained [9]. In the vector constructed by Scholle et al., an amber stop codon, TAG, has been placed at the N-terminus of the coding region of gene III, following the signal sequence of protein III (pIII). That modification eliminates the need for generation of uracil-containing single-stranded DNA (U-ssDNA) template, using E. coli strain CJ236 (dut\n\u2212\nung\n\u2212). A mutagenic oligonucleotide, containing both complementary and exogenous DNA fragments, is then annealed to the ssDNA template, with the exogenous fragment looping over the TAG-containing vector region. Once the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is synthesized from the ssDNA template, it is electroporated into non-suppressor E. coli strain (e.g., SS320). If the TAG triplet-containing region has not been replaced by the exogenous fragment, the phage will not be propagated as the minor coat protein, pIII, cannot be translated. The wild-type phage can be propagated via the suppressor E. coli strain such as TG1 cells. The amber stop codon is then translated into glutamine. The use of TAG-containing template facilitates nearly 100 % recombination efficiency [9].\nTo prepare ssDNA template, infect 30 mL of fresh mid-log TG1 cells, grown in 2 \u00d7 YT medium, with appropriate phage particles (see\nNote\n8). Incubate for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C without shaking. Mix the culture gently from time to time to resuspend settling cells. Incubate overnight at 20\u201325 \u00b0C for approximately 20 h in a shaking incubator with a speed not exceeding 250 rpm; recommended is 200 rpm [12].Prepare a cell-free supernatant by centrifugation and syringe filtration with 0.22 \u03bcm filter.Concentrate the phage by mixing the cell-free phage supernatant with phage precipitation solution (Subheading 2.1, item 25) at 5:1 ration (i.e., 1 mL of solution per 5 mL of phage supernatant), and incubate at room temperature for approximately 20 min.Pellet the phage by centrifugation and resuspend at room temperature PBS (see\nNote\n9).To extract the ssDNA template, process the sample using QIAprep Spin M13 kit.Phosphorylate oligonucleotides (26.4 pmol each, 1.32 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM oligonucleotide) by mixing 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, 1 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 TM buffer, 1 \u03bcL of 10 mM ATP, and 0.5 \u03bcL of 100 mM DTT in a final volume to 10 \u03bcL, adjusted with diH2O. Incubate for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C using thermal cycler.To anneal to the template, mix phosphorylated oligonucleotides with ssDNA template at the molar ratio of 3:1 (oligonucleotide:template), and add 5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 TM buffer in a 50 \u03bcL reaction adjusted with diH2O. Incubate the mixture at 90 \u00b0C for 2 min, and then decrease the temperature to 25 \u00b0C at a rate of 1 \u00b0C per min using thermal cycler.To synthesize the covalently closed circular double-stranded DNA product, add the following to the reaction: 3 \u03bcL of 10 mM ATP, 3 \u03bcL of 100 mM DTT, 5 \u03bcL of dNTPs, 8 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase, and 8 units of T7 DNA polymerase. Incubate at 20 \u00b0C for 30 min using thermal cycler.Analyze the in vitro synthesized dsDNA by resolving on 1 % agarose gel.Purify the dsDNA with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and elute using diH2O.In a prechilled 0.2 cm cuvette, mix SS320 electrocompetent cells and 100 ng to 1 \u03bcg of dsDNA. Electroporate at 2,400 V using an electroporator. Allow the cells to recover in 1 mL of prewarmed SOC medium, and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator (150 rpm), for 30 min to 1 h.To isolate single recombinant clones, mix 1 and 10 \u03bcL of transformation reaction with 400 \u03bcL of fresh mid-log SS320. Incubate for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C without shaking.Immediately before plating, add 4 mL of 2 \u00d7 YT top agar (0.8 %), gently swirl, and pour over prewarmed 2 \u00d7 YT agar plates. Incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C.Amplify phage from single plaques and process the DNA from the virions in the culture supernatant for sequencing (see\nNote\n7).\n",

To assure TG1 infectivity, the cells are first streaked on M9 plates (per 1 L, 8 g sodium phosphate heptahydrate, 3 g potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.5 g sodium chloride, 1 g ammonium chloride, 0.24 g magnesium sulfate, 4 g glucose, 11.1 mg calcium chloride, and 15 g agar). Following 48 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, singles colonies are picked and grown till mid-log phase. Aliquots of 100 \u03bcL mid-log TG1 containing 16 % glycerol are flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To prepare fresh culture, single aliquot of TG1 cells is added to 5\u201310 mL of 2 \u00d7 YT and grown at 37 \u00b0C till mid-log phase.If low quantities of target are available, a small amount can be used to coat the beads (e.g., 10 \u03bcg of protein and 10 \u03bcL of slurry, respectively). Also, decreasing the amount of used target can facilitate isolation of higher affinity clones.For convenience, target-bound beads can be prepared for the entire selection procedure and stored at 4 \u00b0C in the blocking buffer #1 (PBS containing 3 % BSA (w/v)) for up to a week.As long as no contamination is introduced, phage particles can be stored in a culture medium at 4 \u00b0C for many years.Since the phage titer, recovered after final round of selection, depends on many controllable and uncontrollable factors such as stringency of the selections (i.e., number of washes, amount of target used) or type and structure of the target, from our experience, we recommend to cover a wide dilution range from at least 10\u22124\u201310\u22128.If filtered tips are used for phage transfer, it is convenient to briefly rinse and remove the tips with multichannel pipette.In order to identify DNA sequences of potential \u201cbinders,\u201d the phage is first amplified by infecting 200 \u03bcL of TG1 cells (from a mid-log phase culture) with 10 \u03bcL of phage supernatant (or single plaque) and incubated overnight in a shaking incubator (240 rpm), in 5 mL final volume. The pelleted cells are then used for isolation of dsDNA that consists of replicative form of phage DNA. Subsequently, the samples are analyzed via sequencing. Remaining phage supernatant can be stored at 4 \u00b0C (see\nNote\n4).In order to isolate high quantity of ssDNA template, large amount of phage particles has to be first collected. Amplification of phage by infecting cells with just a single plaque may result in low quantity of template. Thus, we suggest a two-step preparation process, where the PEG-precipitated concentrated virions are used to infect the fresh mid-log cells.To remove any polyethylene glycol (PEG) residues from the surface of the tube prior to phage reconstitution, it is recommended to first briefly rinse the side of the tube with PBS, avoiding the phage pellet. Usually 1\u20133 mL of room temperature PBS is used to resuspend the pelleted virions.\n",

            "text": "One of the major advantages of affinity selection of phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries is the potential for rapid discovery of peptide ligands to a target protein. It is relatively straightforward to use homemade or commercially purchased libraries to isolate peptide ligands to a given target and then deduce a binding motif. A peptide with a consensus motif can then be used to study the biology of the target (i.e., predict cellular interacting partner, solve the three-dimensional structure of the peptide and target in a complex, and to inhibit the target in cells). However, when only one or a few peptide ligands are isolated to a target, it is difficult to know a priori what residues in the phage-displayed peptide ligand contribute to binding. While one can explore the binding parameters of the peptide sequence through chemical synthesis of peptides with systematic amino acid replacements across the primary structure, we present an alternative, faster, and easier approach involving Kunkel mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and ELISA. We find that by coupling these three techniques, one can readily determine at first pass many important aspects of the binding interaction.",

In principle, coding regions of any protein domain of interest can be converted into recombinant DNA and expressed as a fusion protein to a partner such as glutathione S-transferase (GST). With a soluble protein in hand, one can perform affinity selections with phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries to identify its peptide ligands. The binding properties of those ligands can be then further characterized through affinity and specificity measurements. To assess the importance of each residue in the peptide ligand, a mutagenic analysis known as alanine scanning can be performed on the recombinant DNA. With that knowledge, potential interacting partners of the protein of interest can be predicted [14]. Finally, improving affinity and specificity of selected ligands through directed evolution may lead to the development of antagonists, which could be used as inhibitors of specific cellular interaction for proof-of-principle experiments of drug development",

Also, it should be noted that sequence 3 (Fig. 3c) contains the FKFP motif, which is present in Ssd1, a known Cbk1 substrate [8, 17]. Our findings clearly indicate that potential binding partners of certain targets can be deduced via selections with phage-displayed peptide libraries.
