A higher number of comorbidities, which increase with age, are correlated with poorer clinical outcomes (Guan et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). Epidemiological data show that the probability of dying from an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus increases with age, from 0.2 in patients \u2264 39 years old to 8% in patients aged 70\u201379 years and 15% in patients \u2265 80 years old (The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team 2020; World Health Organization 2020). Therefore, it is not surprising to find an association between the use of drugs that are more commonly prescribed in older patients and poorer outcomes of COVID-19. However, this association alone does not yet describe anything about causality.",

This hypothesis was expressed in a commentary in Nature Reviews Cardiology (Zheng et al. 2020) and a letter in The British Medical Journal (Sommerstein and Gr\u00e4ni 2020). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, serves as a receptor for the coronavirus and therefore an entry portal into cells. ACE2 is also the entry receptor for SARS-CoV, which caused the 2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak. During therapy with drugs, such as ARBs or ACE inhibitors, more ACE2 receptors are formed, theoretically producing more docking sites for the new coronavirus (Zheng et al. 2020). Because an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and an ARB (losartan) are both among the 10 most commonly used drugs with a combined 152 million prescriptions per year in the USA alone (IQVIA Institute 2019), these patients would represent a substantial group of people at risk.",

The S protein consists of two functional domains, the S1 domain and the S2 domain. The S1 domain mediates the attachment of the virus to surface receptors of the host cell, whereas the S2 domain mediates subsequent fusion between viral and host cell membranes and endocytic entry of the virus. Hoffmann et al. have recently shown that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein engages ACE2 as the crucial entry receptor and employs the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (Hoffmann et al. 2020). Furthermore, the direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 has been confirmed by recent cryo-EM studies (Walls et al. 2020).",

Notably, the injection of SARS-CoV S protein into mice worsened acute lung failure in vivo, but this effect could be attenuated by blocking the classical RAS pathway (Kuba et al. 2005). Imai et al. observed that ACE2 protected against severe acute lung injury in an experimental murine model of acute lung injury, whereas components of the classical RAS pathway, including ACE1, angiotensin II, and the AT1A receptor, promoted disease pathogenesis, induced lung edema, and impaired lung function. Furthermore, recombinant ACE2 protected the mice from severe acute lung injury (Imai et al. 2005).",

In animal models of arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, pressure overload, or diabetes mellitus, cardiac ACE2 was downregulated compared with healthy control animals (Ocaranza et al. 2006; Tikellis et al. 2006; Qiao et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2019).

            "text": "The local inflammatory process in severe COVID-19 can induce parenchymal injuries, such as damage to the alveolar-capillary unit (Shi et al. 2020). Local inflammation involves the production of prostaglandins by inducible cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and the recruitment and activation of effector cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils. This contributes to the development of pain and fever that occur during infection, which is the main reason why NSAIDs are so commonly used in infections. Alternatively, COX2 also has a pivotal role in the resolution of inflammation, thereby preventing self-inflicted damage from the immune response (Levy et al. 2001).",

Given the dual role of COX2 in the inflammatory response, such as amplifying the initial acute phase and then promoting resolution, the question arises whether taking NSAIDs during SARS-CoV-2 infection could improve or complicate the course of the disease. The question becomes particularly important because of the two-phase immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection: the first immune defense-based protective phase and the second inflammation-driven damaging phase leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and subsequent fatality (Shi et al. 2020). Due to the current novelty of COVID-19, data concerning the influence of NSAID use on COVID-19 outcomes remain needed.",

            "text": "A retrospective study of critically ill 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic patients did not show any evidence that NSAID use affects mortality (Epperly et al. 2016). Following the SARS outbreak caused by SARS-CoV, investigators discovered that the NSAID indomethacin had direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV via blocking viral RNA synthesis independent of COX inhibition (Amici et al. 2006). Furthermore, antiviral activity has been confirmed in vivo in dogs infected with canine coronavirus (Amici et al. 2006), but no human studies have been performed to confirm a positive effect for indomethacin treatment on SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections. Notably, observational studies suggest an association between pre-hospital NSAID exposure and a protracted and complicated course of pneumonia (Voiriot et al. 2019). A survey by the French National Agency of Medicine and Health Products Safety revealed that infections caused by varicella and some bacterial infections could be aggravated by the NSAIDs ibuprofen and ketoprofen. Based on this report, the Safety Committee of the European Medicines Agency recently initiated a review of these drugs. The mechanisms by which NSAID use may lead to a complicated course of pneumonia are uncertain. It could be assumed that the intake of NSAIDs suppresses the main symptoms of inflammation, such as fever and pain, and therefore delays the timely detection of pneumonia and the subsequent start of appropriate therapy (Voiriot et al. 2019). Accordingly, most NSAID drug labels warn that these drugs could mask the signs or symptoms of infection. Another mechanism could be the immunological effects of NSAIDs, such as the impaired resolution of inflammation, thus resulting in prolonged disease (Voiriot et al. 2019).",

Recommendations are as follows:Based on the currently available evidence, effective treatment with RAS blockers should not be discontinued or switched. The relatively hypothetical risk of worsening COVID-19 does not justify discontinuing or switching ARBs or ACE inhibitors due to the specific risk of destabilizing blood pressure control, stroke, heart attack, or worsening heart failure (van der Wardt et al. 2017; Halliday et al. 2019). Insufficient control of concomitant diseases caused by drug discontinuation could make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicate the course of disease.Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend patients who take ibuprofen for medically indicated reasons to change their anti-inflammatory medication in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period. The choice of drug to treat fever or pain in COVID-19 should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration) and the respective treatment guidelines that in most cases recommend paracetamol as the first treatment option for fever or pain associated with infections.",
