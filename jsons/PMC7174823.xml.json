The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, is closely related to the SARS-CoV4 which caused the SARS epidemic in 2003. As a consequence of SARS, Singapore set up a series of national prevention and response measures including the creation of a Disease Outbreak Response System Condition5 (DORSCON) (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). On 7 February 2020, Singapore's DORSCON level was escalated from yellow to orange signifying community transmission, triggering heightened surveillance, border control, containment protocols, and widespread contact tracing.",

All NCIS staff (clinical and non-clinical) were segregated into two teams to ensure that whole departments were not quarantined in the event of an infection. Physicians' leave was cancelled to maximize manpower resources. Physician sub-teams were further geographically confined to specific ward, outpatient, and office areas to minimize exposure and cross-contamination (supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Each outpatient sector had its own registration counter, triage, venipuncture service, consultation rooms, isolation rooms, and lavatories, to facilitate contact tracing. In the cancer pharmacy, one team carried out dispensing of outpatient prescriptions and review of chemotherapy orders, while the other team compounded chemotherapy, managed investigational studies, and stored inventory (supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Each team at the radiotherapy treatment center comprised radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, physicists, nurses, and administrative staff. A smaller team of physicians was dedicated to cover an NCIS satellite center located 8 km away and cross-hospital transfer of staff was prohibited. Community cancer services (e.g. home chemotherapy and nursing) were discontinued to consolidate manpower. Face-to-face meetings were cancelled, and all department meetings, including multidisciplinary tumor boards, were conducted on a secure video-conferencing platform.",

In outpatients, non-resident referrals were stopped and appointments for patients on cancer surveillance were deferred. Telemedicine consults, home delivery of medications, and online payment was encouraged. Volunteer groups coordinated the delivery of maintenance chemotherapy to childhood leukemia patients residing outside of Singapore. For patients undergoing radiation therapy, hypofractionated treatments were favored, while specialized procedures such as stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiosurgery, and brachytherapy were limited. In the inpatient setting, cancer surgeries were allowed to proceed as planned but all non-cancer surgeries were postponed by 3 months. Hospital negative-pressure isolation rooms were reassigned to the pandemic team for COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases. Due to an anticipated shortage of these rooms hospital-wide and the nursing complexity of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients, low-risk suspected COVID-19 HSCT patients were kept in the HSCT unit high-efficiency particulate air-filtered single rooms with an antechamber. Non-HSCT hematology patients who were low-risk suspected cases for COVID-19 were admitted to neutral pressure isolation rooms, rather than negative pressure rooms, thereby preventing them from being exposed to other nosocomial infection sources. A nationwide blood product shortage resulted from social distancing practices, cancellation of mobile blood drives, and stringent donor screening. For cancer patients, blood stocks were conserved for emergency surgeries, active bleeding, and semi-elective cancer surgeries. Red cell and platelet transfusion were limited per patient and lower hemoglobin thresholds were accepted for asymptomatic patients.",

Each case was discussed with the on-call coronavirus consultant. All cancer patients admitted with confirmed or high-risk suspected COVID-19 were managed in a designated ward by the pandemic team, staffed by internal medicine physicians, with telemedicine support from hematology-oncology.

Due to travel restrictions affecting overseas study subjects, options were explored to use laboratory tests in the subject's home country, telemedicine consults, and courier of study medicines. Institutional ethics review boards and sponsors were forewarned about possible increases in protocol deviations during this period.

Since then, all health care institutions conducted compulsory PPE training, N95 mask fitting, and yearly hand hygiene exercises for staff, in preparation for future outbreaks. Clear communication was also recognized to be key to minimizing uncertainty among staff. From the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, senior hospital management gave daily email updates on the status of cases nationwide, modifications to workflow, and suspect case definition. NCIS staff were issued personal thermometers for twice-daily temperature recording. The threshold for COVID-19 testing in health care workers was low, and staff with respiratory symptoms or fever were given at least 5 days of medical leave. Crucially, staff morale was expected to be affected by the workload of team segregation, cancellation of leave, and enforced social distancing. Strategies to boost morale were therefore considered vital, and included sharing of appreciation messages, provision of refreshments, as well as the setup of a group chat to share anecdotes, information, and banter.",

We show that despite COVID-19 community transmission, the segregated team model allowed the continuation of cancer care and clinical trials, and may be replicable in other similar centers globally.
