Elderly patients with history of recent abdominal/fl ank/low back pain, known hypertension, pulsatile abdominal mass and feeble/absent distal pulses are suggestive of abdominal aortic aneurysm/dissection.

It is not very useful in noisy ED. -Auscultation : It gives information regarding bowel and vascular status. Absent or diminished bowel sound indicates ileus, mesenteric ischaemia, narcotic use or peritonitis. Hyperactive bowel sounds suggest small bowel obstruction, enteritis or early ischaemic intestine. High pitched tinkling sound refl ects Emergency physicians should be vigilant and think of serious pathology in presence of any of the following clinical features:Extensive differential considerations ranging from simple nonspecifi c abdominal pain to severe life-threatening conditions are mentioned inTable 26.3 . It is essential to suspect life-threatening conditions (Box 26.1 ) in haemodynamically unstable. Early resuscitation and stabilisation should be followed by investigations and hospitalisation of such patients.Women of reproductive age group with abdominal pain should undergo pregnancy test and seek gynaecological consult and bedside ultrasonography if necessary. Consider ectopic pregnancy in such patients unless proven otherwise.It is not necessary to reach proper diagnosis despite availability of various tests. It is incumbent to consider extra-abdominal causes(Table 26.4 ) in such patients before considering it as nonspecifi c.",
