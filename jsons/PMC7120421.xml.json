Human Ad12 infecting hamster cells and leading to oncogenic transformation is a case in point and only one of several examples. The retrovirus HIV of originally simian origin or the coronavirus SARS of canine origin upon their adaptation to the human organism are examples of extraordinary medical importance. Hence the study of the interaction of human Ad12 with cells of the Syrian hamster has been considered of importance to understand this abortive interaction of oncogenic relevance at the molecular level.",

            "text": "One of the characteristics of the Ad12-hamster cell system is a strictly abortive infection cycle (review H\u00f6sel et al. 2003). The block of Ad12 replication lies before viral DNA replication (Doerfler 1969) and late gene transcription which cannot be detected (Ortin et al. 1976). Ad12 adsorption, cellular uptake, and transport of the viral DNA to the nucleus were less efficient in the nonpermissive hamster cells than in permissive human cells. However, many of the early functions of the Ad12 genome were expressed in BHK21 cells, though at a low level. In the downstream region of the major late promoter (MLP) of Ad12 DNA, a mitigator element of 33 nucleotide pairs in length was identified which contributed to the inactivity of the MLP in hamster cells and its markedly decreased activity in human cells (Zock and Doerfler 1990). The E1 functions of Ad2 or Ad5 were capable of partly complementing these Ad12 deficiencies in hamster cells in that Ad12 viral DNA replication and late gene transcription could proceed, e.g., in a BHK hamster cell line, BHK297-C131, which carried in an integrated form and constitutively expressed the E1 region of Ad5 DNA (Klimkait and Doerfler 1985). Nevertheless, the late Ad12 mRNAs, which were synthesized in this system and carried the authentic Ad12 nucleotide sequence, failed to be translated to structural viral proteins (Schiedner et al. 1994). Hence, infectious virions were not produced even in this partly complemented system. There appears to exist an additional translational block for late Ad12 mRNAs in hamster cells. We have further shown that the overexpression of the Ad12 preterminal protein (pTP) or of E1A genes facilitated the synthesis of full-length, authentic Ad12 DNA in Ad12-infected BHK21 hamster cells. Apparently, the Ad12 pTP had a hitherto unknown function in eliciting full cycles of Ad12 DNA replication even in nonpermissive BHK21 cells when sufficient levels of Ad12 pTP were produced (H\u00f6sel et al. 2001). The amounts of Ad12 DNA in the nuclei or cytoplasm of the complemented hamster cells were about 2 orders of magnitude [2 h postinfection (p.i.)] and 4\u20135 orders of magnitude (48 h p. i.) lower than in permissive human cells. Cell line BHK21-hCAR is transgenic for and expresses the human coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (hCAR) gene. Nuclear uptake of Ad12 DNA in BHK21-hCAR cells was markedly increased compared to that in na\u00efve BHK21 cells. Ad12 elicited a cytopathic effect in BHK21-hCAR cells but not in BHK21 cells. Quantitative PCR or [3H]-thymidine labeling followed by zone velocity sedimentation however failed to detect Ad12 DNA replication in BHK21 or BHK21-hCAR cells. Newly assembled Ad12 virions could not be detected. Thus, the block in Ad12 DNA replication in hamster cells was not released by the hCAR-enhanced nuclear import of Ad12 DNA (Hochstein et al. 2008).",

In this way, the viral genomes are immortalized and expanded into a huge number of tumor cells. Moreover, the totally abortive cycle of Ad12 in Syrian hamster cells is one of the decisive preconditions for the ability of Ad12 to induce tumor cells and tumors in Syrian hamsters, since Ad12-infected cells are capable of surviving virus infection, in contrast to the Ad12-human cell system in which all infected cells are killed (Doerfler 1991).",

Their stability is variable and dependent on numerous, unidentified environmental factors. DNA fragments with free termini and DNA protein complexes belong to the most stable and aggressive molecules in nature and represent versatile recombination partners which can target the genomes of recipient cells. The pathways of DNA from cellular remnants in the environment to the nucleus of successfully entered cells and their genomes are poorly understood. DNA carried by viruses is well equipped for entry into specialized cells. In an earlier study on the fate of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) DNA added directly to a culture of actively replicating human KB cells, between 3 and 9% of this DNA became associated with the cells in a DNase-resistant form (Groneberg et al. 1975). At 24 hr after the addition of DNA to the culture medium, 70% of the cell-associated DNA was found in the nucleus, and this DNA had been endonucleolytically fragmented. Direct penetration of the cytoplasmic membrane, perhaps during cell division, appeared the most likely mechanism for DNA uptake in these experiments. I suspect that there are less haphazardly acting mechanisms via DNA-sensitive receptors on the cell\u2019s surface.",

Immuno-histochemical assays for the expression of tissue-specific markers identified vimentin, synaptophysin, and neuronal-specific enolase in all tumors. The presence of the latter two proteins was compatible with the neuronal origin of the Ad12-induced tumors, whereas vimentin was typical for their mesenchymal derivation. Tests for additional tissue markers proved marginally positive (S-100, glia fiber protein) or negative (Table 3.1).\n\n\n",

            "text": "\nAd12-transformed cells or Ad12-induced hamster tumor cells carry up to >30 copies of viral genomes chromosomally integrated by covalent bonds between viral and cellular DNAs (Stabel et al. 1980; Hilger-Eversheim and Doerfler 1997; Knoblauch et al. 1996; Hohlweg et al. 2003; Hochstein et al. 2007).Although multiple copies of viral DNA are integrated, there is most frequently only one site of Ad12 DNA insertion on the chromosomes. In one study, 59/60 Ad12-induced tumors showed only one chromosomal site of Ad12 DNA integration as detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (Hilger-Eversheim and Doerfler 1997). The integratiion site was different in each tumor.In different Ad12-transformed cells or Ad12-induced tumor cells, viral DNA integration occurred at different sites in the cellular genome. There is no evidence for a specific cellular site of viral DNA insertion (Deuring et al. 1981b; Doerfler et al. 1983; Knoblauch et al. 1996; Hilger-Eversheim and Doerfler 1997).At the sites of recombination between the Ad12 and the cellular genomes, short or patchy nucleotide sequence homologies were frequently observed (Gahlmann et al. 1982; Stabel and Doerfler 1982). Moreover, the cellular pre-integration sites of viral DNA insertion often showed transcriptional activity and presumably an open chromatin structure (Schulz et al. 1987; Hochstein et al. 2007).Most of the integrated Ad12 genomes appeared to be intact, but fragmented genomes were also observed (Stabel et al. 1980; Hochstein et al. 2007). At the site of foreign DNA integration, cellular DNA sequences have been found to be completely conserved (Gahlmann and Doerfler 1983). In other instances, some of the abutting cellular DNA sequences were deleted.Recombination of Ad12 DNA with a cloned hamster cell DNA fragment, which had previously been identified as an integration site of Ad12 DNA, could be elicited also in a cell-free system by using high-salt nuclear extracts from hamster cells (Jessberger et al. 1989; Tatzelt et al. 1993).There is evidence that adenovirus DNA can recombine with cellular DNA also in human cells productively infected with adenoviruses (Burger and Doerfler 1974; Schick et al. 1976). An integrated state of viral DNA is difficult to prove since human cells productively infected with adenoviruses do not survive the infection. However, the discovery of a symmetric recombinant between Ad12 DNA and human cellular DNA has documented that Ad12 DNA does in fact recombine with cellular DNA even in productively infected cells (Deuring et al. 1981a; Deuring and Doerfler 1983).All of the aforementioned characteristics of Ad12 DNA integration in hamster cells have been confirmed in studies on the integration of replication-deficient adenovirus vector genomes in mouse cells (Stephen et al. 2010). In this system, adenoviral infection is compatible with cell survival due to the replication deficiency of the adenoviral vector genomes used. The results described in this system confirmed all our earlier findings in the Ad12 hamster cell system and in human cells productively infected with Ad12.\n",

These data were extended to activity studies of promoter-indicator gene constructs by using adenoviral promoters in order to document that pre-methylated promoters led to gene silencing, whereas unmethylated promoters allowed gene transcription (Vardimon et al. 1982; Kruczek and Doerfler 1983; Langner et al. 1984, 1986; Knebel and Doerfler 1986; Munnes et al. 1998). The silencing effect of promoter methylation could be partly or completely reversed by the expression of a viral trans-activator/ enhancer sequence, e.g., of the E1 proteins of Ad2 (Langner et al. 1986; Weisshaar et al. 1988), or by the close vicinity of a strong viral promoter/enhancer element, e.g., that of the human cytomegalovirus (Knebel-M\u00f6rsdorf et al. 1988). Today, it has been generally appreciated that many factors collaborate in regulating eukaryotic promoter function. Nevertheless, promoter methylation remains one of the dominant and experimentally convenient factors when studying the long-term silencing of gene activities.",

            "text": "The Ad12-transformed cell line T637 originated from BHK21 hamster cells following the infection of these cells with Ad12 and the selection of cells which expressed early Ad12 gene products (Strohl et al. 1970). In comparison to the levels of DNA methylation in the ~900 copies of the retrotransposon intracisternal A particle (IAP) genomes in the parent BHK21 cells, methylation of the IAP sequences in T637 cells, which are transgenomic for Ad12 DNA, was very markedly increased as detected by Southern blot hybridization (Heller et al. 1995). The extent of methylation augmentation in the T637 cell genome suggested that alterations in CpG methylation involved the entire cellular genome, since IAP sequences are distributed over many hamster chromosomes, frequently on their short arms (Heller et al. 1995; Meyer zu Altenschildesche et al. 1996). Methylation in other parts of the T637 genome\u2014including single copy genes\u2014was also enhanced (Heller et al. 1995). These hyper-methylation patterns persisted in TR3 cells, a revertant of T637 cells (Groneberg et al. 1978; Groneberg and Doerfler 1979) which had lost all Ad12 DNA sequences.1 Hence, the effects of foreign DNA insertions on cellular CpG methylation patterns were not dependent on the continued presence of the originally causative insertion of foreign (Ad12) genomes. This mechanism has the characteristics of a \u201chit-and-run\u201d event. Since we consider the genome-wide methylation effects of Ad12 integration as crucial to the transformation and its oncogenic consequences (Doerfler 1995, 2000, 2011, 2012), the much debated possibility of a \u201chit-and-run\u201d mechanism in viral oncogenesis is again raised by these results and has to be considered highly relevant.",

The genome segment upstream of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene on chromosome Xq27.3 contains several genetic signals (Naumann et al. 2009). Among them, we have described a DNA methylation boundary which is located 65\u201370 CpGs upstream of the CGG repeat in the gene\u2019s untranslated first exon and has been detected in any human (or mouse) cell type investigated (Naumann et al. 2009). In patients with the fragile X syndrome (FXS) (OMIM 300624), the methylation boundary is lost and, as a consequence, de novo methylation spreads downstream into the FMR1 promoter region and subsequently leads to promoter inactivation (Naumann et al. 2009). Loss of the FMR1 gene product is the cause for the FXS (for review O\u2019Donnell and Warren 2002). This stable methylation boundary appears to help protect the promoter against the spreading of de novo methylation (Naumann et al. 2009, 2010). In cells transgenomic for EBV DNA or for the telomerase gene, the large number of normally methylated CpGs in the far-upstream region of the boundary is decreased about fourfold (Naumann et al. 2014). We have interpreted this marked decrease of DNA CpG methylation in a well-studied part of the human genome as a consequence of the introduction of foreign genomes (EBV or telomerase gene) into human cells (Naumann et al. 2014).",

In five non-transgenomic HCT116 control clones, transcription and methylation patterns proved very similar among individual cell clones. These control data facilitated comparisons of these patterns between non-transgenomic and transgenomic clones. In 4.7% of the 28.869 gene segments analyzed, the transcriptional activities were upregulated (907 genes) or downregulated (436 genes) (Weber et al. 2015) (Fig. 3.2a). Upregulations were frequently found in small nucleolar RNA genes which regulate RNA metabolism and in genes involved in signaling pathways. Genome-wide methylation profiling was performed for 361,983 CpG sites. In comparisons of methylation levels in five transgenomic versus four non-transgenomic cell clones, 3791 CpGs were differentially methylated, 1504 CpGs were hyper-methylated, and 2287 were hypo-methylated (Fig. 3.2b). These differential values, both for transcriptional activities and methylation patterns, were statistically corrected for minute differences in some of the 28.869 genome segments in non-transgenomic cell clones. The importance of transgenome size, CG or gene content, copy number, and the mechanism(s) responsible for the observed epigenetic alterations have not yet been investigated.\n",

            "text": "In studies on the integrated state of Ad12 DNA in Ad12-transformed hamster cells, we discovered that the CpG methylation profiles in some of their endogenous retrotransposon sequences and in several cellular genes were increased. This augmented methylation persisted in revertants of the transformed cells that had lost all Ad12 genomes (\u201chit-and-run\u201d mechanism). Moreover, alterations of DNA methylation and transcription profiles were documented in Ad12 DNA- and in bacteriophage \u03bb DNA-transgenomic cells.I have previously hypothesized that epigenetic effects in mammalian genomes due to the insertion of foreign DNA are a general phenomenon (Doerfler 2012). These alterations might play a role in (viral) oncogenesis and are possibly instrumental during evolution as a consequence of multiple retroviral DNA insertions into ancient genomes. Over evolutionary times, these alterations of transcription profiles might have led to novel phenotypes that were then selected for or against depending on environmental conditions during evolution (Doerfler 2016).To examine the general significance of these observations, we designed a model system for proof-of-principle assessment. Human cells from cell line HCT116 were rendered transgenomic by transfecting a 5.6 kbp bacterial plasmid and selecting cell clones with foreign plasmids stably integrated, most likely at different genomic sites.In five non-transgenomic HCT116 control clones without the plasmid, transcription and methylation patterns proved similar, if not identical, among five individual cell clones. This finding opened the possibility for comparisons of these patterns between non-transgenomic and transgenomic clones.In 4.7% of the 28,869 gene segments analyzed, the transcriptional activities were upregulated (907 genes) or downregulated (436 genes) in plasmid-transgenomic cell clones in comparison to control clones. A significant gene set enrichment was found in 43 canonical pathways. Frequent upregulations were noted in small nucleolar RNA genes that regulate RNA metabolism and in genes involved in signaling pathways.Genome-wide methylation profiling was performed for 361,983 CpG sites. In comparisons of methylation levels in five transgenomic versus four non-transgenomic cell clones, 3791 CpGs were differentially methylated, 1504 CpGs were hyper-methylated, and 2287 were hypo-methylated.Thus, the epigenetic effects in the wake of foreign DNA integration events can be considered a very significant effect also in human cells. We still lack insights into the role of transgenome size, gene or CG content, or copy number of the transgenome. The mechanism(s) underlying the observed epigenetic alterations are unknown. Extent and location of alterations in genome activities and CpG methylation might depend on the site(s) of foreign DNA insertion.In the same cell clones studied as described above, differences in methylation and transcription profiles in some of the HERV and LINE-1.2 repetitive elements were not observed.We note that genome manipulations in general\u2014work with transgenomic or knocked cells and organisms\u2014have assumed a major role in molecular biology and medicine. The consequences of cellular genome manipulations for epigenetic stability have so far received unwarrantedly limited attention. Before drawing far-reaching conclusions from work with cells or organisms with manipulated genomes, critical considerations for and careful analyses of their epigenomic stability will prove prudent.\n",

(a) Volcano plot displays non-standardized signals (log2 fold-change) on the x-axis against standardized signals (\u2212log10 FDR-adjusted p-value) on the y-axis for the comparison of five non-transgenomic against seven transgenomic cell clones of all 28,869 genes analyzed. Upregulated genes in transgenomic cell clones were displayed in red and downregulated genes in blue (FC \u00b1 2, adjusted p-values <0.05; n = 1343 genes). (b) Volcano plot displays differences in methylation on the x-axis against standardized methylation (\u2212log10 FDR-adjusted p-value) on the y-axis for the comparison of four non-transgenomic against five pC1-5.6 transgenomic cell clones of all 361,983 CpGs interrogated. Hyper-methylated CpGs in transgenomic cell clones were displayed in red and hypo-methylated CpGs in blue (\u0394\u03b2 value \u22650.2, adjusted p-value <0.05; n = 3791 CpGs).
