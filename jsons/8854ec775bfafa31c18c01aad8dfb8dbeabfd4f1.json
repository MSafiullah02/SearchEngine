            "text": "Three patterns of transmission occurred in the hospital: (1) between healthcare workers (HCWs), (2) from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, and (3) from nonclinical hospital staff to others. Figure 1 illustrates a timeline of the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus within the hospital from the first confirmed case on March 20 to the most recent case on April 1. The first SARS-Cov-2-positive case was a medical worker (P87), who was in close contact with a SARS-Cov-2-infected nurse (P86). 2 With the exception of the 2 infected cases, P86 and P28, who contracted the coronavirus from the outside, no HCW, non-COVID-19 inpatients, or visitors had tested positive for the coronavirus. Since March 28, SARS-CoV-2 infections among nonclinical staff have emerged, and subsequently, 25 of the 37 COVID-19 cases (68%) were nonclinical staff working in the dining hall of the hospital. These catering workers were responsible for preparing meals and delivering food and hot water to patients and visitors across the hospital daily, and it is likely that these nonclinical staff are the main contributors to the spread of the virus within the hospital. Healthcare-associated infection is known characteristic of coronavirus-related diseases and a leading route of transmission. 3 Because the confirmed cases linked to healthcare-acquired infection have only very recently been revealed and are increasing in Vietnam, several measures have been implemented to stop the spread of the disease in this hospital 4 Based on the transmission dynamics described earlier, we conclude that the major contributing factor to the significant increase in healthcare-acquired infections is extensive access of nonclinical staff across the hospital. These nonclinical workers did not properly implement effective personal protection and lacked sufficient preparedness for the emerging infectious disease during their work shifts, leading to cross contamination between the hospital units. After the implementation of lockdown at the hospital and other mitigation measures, the numbers of new confirmed cases reported on March 31 and April 1 have begun to decrease. However, this decrease does not indicate that the outbreak in the hospital has been successfully eliminated. Therefore, in addition to the measures above, the hospital should take into consideration the following suggestions to stave off widespread coronavirus transmission in this healthcare facility and in the community: ",
