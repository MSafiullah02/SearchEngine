A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed Central, LILACS, and Google Scholar using the keywords 'covid ' AND 'newborn' OR 'child' OR 'infant,' on 18 March 2020, and again on 17 April 2020. One researcher conducted the search and extracted data on demographics, maternal outcomes, diagnostic tests, imaging, and neonatal outcomes. Results. Of 256 publications identified, 20 met inclusion criteria and comprised neonatal outcome data for 222 newborns whose mothers were suspected or confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive perinatally (17 studies) or of newborns referred to hospital with infection/pneumonia (3 studies). Most (12 studies) were case-series reports; all were from China, except three (Australia, Iran, and Spain). Of the 222 newborns, 13 were reported as positive for SARS-CoV-2; most of the studies reported no or mild symptoms and no adverse perinatal outcomes. Two papers among those from newborns who tested positive reported moderate or severe clinical characteristics. Five studies using data on umbilical cord blood, placenta, and/or amniotic fluid reported no positive results. Nine studies reported radiographic imaging, including 5 with images of pneumonia, increased lung marking, thickened texture, or high-density nodular shadow. Minor, non-specific changes in biochemical variables were reported. Studies that tested breast milk reported negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Conclusions. Given the paucity of studies at this time, vertical transmission cannot be confirmed or denied. Current literature does not support abstaining from breastfeeding nor separating mothers and newborns. Further evidence and data collection networks, particularly in the Americas, are needed for establishing definitive guidelines and recommendations.",

Understanding the issues related to perinatal concerns is critical when developing recommendations for these population groups.

Cases reported were mostly from China, except for one report from Iran (8), one from Spain (9) , and one from Australia (11) . They referred mostly to pregnant women and their newborns, except for 3 case reports of only newborns. Six studies (6, 8, 9, 17, 22, 25) examined cases of newborns who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on samples taken 36 hr -17 days after birth (10 newborns in all). One newborn was initially reported to be positive for COVID-19, but upon a second testing of the same sample, the authors changed the result to a false positive (22) . Two additional papers (10, 20) reported newborns who tested negative for SARS CoV-2 by PCR but showed high levels of IgM and IgG. Dong and colleagues (10) reported a newborn who tested negative for SARS CoV-2, with IgM and IgG values > 10 AU/ml on the day of birth and 14 days later. Zeng and colleagues (20) reported a series of 6 newborns who were PCR negative for SARS CoV-2, with 5 having IgG values > 10 AU/ml and 2 also having IgM > 10AU/ml.",

Seventeen studies included results from suspected or confirmed pregnant women and their newborns at the time of birth (8, 14 and 17 included only newborns readmitted testing positive for SARS-CoV-2). From these studies, two cases reports (6, 9) and two case series reports (22, 25) reported newborns tested positive at 36 hours (6), 8 days (9), 2 and 4 days (25) after birth; one newborn reported by Liu and colleagues (22) was classified as false positive. Two papers (10, 20) that reported elevated values of IgM and IgG were not consistent enough to support in-utero transmission; they lacked confirmatory results from maternal or newborn samples, e.g., amniotic fluid or infant\u00b4s PCR. Even when one study (10) may contribute to suspecting mother-to-child transmission, the evidence is not conclusive (26) . Some newborns were positive for COVID-19 in spite of the reported use of preventive measures during and after delivery (6, 8, 9, 22, 25) , but even in these cases there was no evidence supporting vertical transmission.",

Un investigador llev\u00f3 a cabo la b\u00fasqueda y extrajo datos sobre demograf\u00eda, resultados maternos, pruebas de diagn\u00f3stico, im\u00e1genes y resultados neonatales. Resultados. De las 256 publicaciones identificadas, 20 cumplieron los criterios de inclusi\u00f3n y comprend\u00edan datos de resultados neonatales de 222 reci\u00e9n nacidos cuyas madres eran casos sospechosos o positivos confirmados de SARS-CoV-2 en el per\u00edodo perinatal (17 estudios) o bien reci\u00e9n nacidos internados en el hospital con infecci\u00f3n/neumon\u00eda (3 estudios).
