Few data on this possible risk exist to date; at the time of this Correspondence being published, there is a regis tered retrospective study in China for patients with rheumatic disease and a case series from the USA listing rheumatic disease as a preadmission comorbidity. 3 As studies regard ing treatments for and outcomes of COVID-19 emerge, it seems possible that immunomodulation could alter the disease course of COVID-19. Many reports have cited the use of medications commonly found in the rheumatology armamentar ium for the management of COVID-19, includ ing hydroxychloroquine, gluco corticoids, intravenous immuno globulin, antiinterleukin (IL)-1 and anti-IL-6 therapies, and Janus kinase inhibitors. 4 The world is watch ing with great interest to see if those drugs can save lives during this pandemic. In addition to the rapid progression of respiratory failure, COVID-19 seems to be most fatal when it triggers a cytokine storm. 5 However, there are currently no tools to identify patients at greatest risk of develop ing this complication, and the mechanisms by which this reaction occurs in the setting of COVID-19 are not fully understood.",

The current outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caught the attention of the medical community and the world at large. A local out break of a respiratory illness was first reported to WHO on Dec 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the resulting disease is now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1 The virus spread quickly throughout China, and subsequently the world. At the time of the ACR session in November, 2019, no-one could have imagined the global pandemic that is now unfolding. media, email listservs, and personal and professional networks. Within 48 h of inception, the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance had engaged rheumatologists across six continents; support from nonprofit organisations promoting the health of patients with rheumatic diseases and major rheumatology journals followed soon after, with approximately 100 organisations endorsing the alliance at the time of this Correspondence. The COVID-19 Alliance will obtain data on any patient with rheumatic disease who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, capturing the range from mild to severe cases, with the goal of informing risk and best practice during the outbreak. With this novel pathogenic threat, there is much that is not yet known, and many ways this virus could impact the rheumatology community (panel).",

Rheumatology professionals care for patients with diseases that have a high risk of morbidity and mortality and manage rare dis eases; a global collaboration enables these professionals to collect enough data to inform clinical decisions. The sharing and dissemination of information about the diagnosis and management of rheumatic dis eases worldwide is important at all times, but is especially crucial during these uniquely uncharted times. Rheumatologists are managing a new threat, but the development of tools, such as telehealth platforms and open-source algorithms, can help inform strategies for global education and communication within the rheumatology community beyond the COVID-19 threat. We believe that the global community created in this dire time has the power and commitment to remain unified when the pandemic has passed. Our modern should be meticulously reported in peer-reviewed publications to avoid potentially mis leading accounts and the risk of dangerous self-medication by the public. The rapid identification and develop ment of such novel treat ments is encouraging and will be instrumental in the battle against COVID-19, as long as prudence and rigour continue to be practised in both implementation and reporting.",

The lethal dose of chloroquine in adults is about 5 g. 2 In the human body, chloroquine has a large volume of distribution with an elimination half-life of 20-60 days and a tendency to accumulate in metabolically active tissues at higher levels compared with the plasma concentration. 3, 4 In view of these properties, the recommended dose of 500 mg twice per day can quickly approach danger thresholds with sustained use. At the maximum course of 10 days, this regimen is substantially more aggressive than recommended regimens for the use of chloroquine as an antimalarial. The effects of chloroquine poisoning are well documented and include retinopathy and immunosuppress ion, with contraindications in sev eral conditions including pregnancy. 3 On Feb 26, 2020, the treatment guidelines were revised, shorten ing the maximum course to 7 days while recommending a lower dose for patients weighing less than 50 kg and highlighting contraindications including pregnancy. 5 It is encourag ing that an appropriate adjust ment with improved consideration for the toxicological properties of the drug was made so quickly given the urgency of the situation. However, we advise continued caution in bringing new treatments to clinical use in such a rapid manner. Recommended doses should be established with close reference to pharmacological pro files and side-effects must be closely monitored.",
