In this chapter, we review our recent research where we used AFM to investigate physical properties of phospholipid monolayers, bilayers, and cell membranes. We describe the experimental procedures for AFM imaging, force measurements, and theoretical models to analyze force spectroscopy data. The data obtained allowed correlations between AFM topography and local adhesion and mechanoelastic properties of supported lipid bilayers in water, supported pulmonary surfactant films in air, and the plasma membrane of epithelial type II cells. Finally, AFM was applied to help elucidate the effect of anesthetics and cholesterol present in the lipid films.",

As the major constituents of the biological membranes that form the outer boundary of cells and organelles they are involved in a vast number of biological processes. Their functions are to compartmentalize the cells, sort, regulate, and mediate biomolecular interactions. These complex functions are possible owing to the diverse physical-chemical properties of these membranes, which include two-dimensional fluidity, material elasticity, chemical diversity, and rich phase behavior [2] . Understanding the physical and chemical properties of lipid membranes [3, 4] and how they control biological processes is critical to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of many diseases and finding a cure for them. The variety in structure and physical properties of cell membranes governs their biomolecular assembly and plays an important role in many fundamental biological processes [5] . For example, small, condensed rafts of spingolipids, cholesterol, and raft-associated protein play a crucial role in signaling, intracellular trafficking of lipids, platelet activation, membrane fusion, and protein binding [6, 7] . Lipid rafts present in a cell membrane serve as entry and exit sites for microbial pathogens, such as influenza virus, measles virus, and HIV. Lipid-protein mixtures not only form membranes. Pulmonary surfactant [8, 9] , which is a specific lipid-protein complex, forms a molecular film that covers the lung's interface with the air [10] . The major functions of pulmonary surfactant are to reduce the surface tension of the airspaceliquid interface, provide stability to the alveolar structure, and reduce the work of breathing [11] . Understanding the lateral distribution and interactions among the lipids and proteins in pulmonary surfactant monolayers is extremely important in order to develop methods of preventing alveolar collapse in cases of surfactant deficiency such as in premature infants or dysfunctional surfactant such as in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12] .",

SPBs are composed of phospholipids adsorbed to a planar solid support. They also are of importance for biotechnology applications, as they form membrane-mimetic materials useful for creation of new classes of biosensors, diagnostic tools, and high-throughput characterization platforms for rapid and early detection of interactions between cells and their environment [14, 15] . Such lipid films can serve as templates into which functional biomolecules can be incorporated, creating a powerful platform for the development of nanosensor and nanodevices. For biomedical and nanotechnology applications it is important to control processes involving the interaction of lipid membranes and monolayers with DNA and proteins, as well as polymers and inorganic nanoparticles. Adhesion of particles to the supported lipid films is important in biotechnology and medicine applications, for example, to study toxicity of nanoscale air pollutants and also for the development of effective pulmonary drug delivery systems [16] .",

To understand a response of a biological system to its environment one needs to measure the physical and chemical properties of the macromolecular assembly, such as membranes and monolayers, and how these properties are affected by mechanical stress, thermal change, and/or molecular adsorption. It concerns the mechanical properties such as two-dimensional fluidity and anisotropic elasticity of the membrane as well as thermodynamic properties underlying its rich phase behavior. Those bulk properties can also be investigated by a thermodynamic approach such as calorimetry, densitometry, contact angle measurement, or analysis of adsorption kinetics using surface plasmon resonance or ellipsometry. On a molecular level, molecular dynamics simulation has been employed, providing an insight into the organization of lipid structures and the stability. AFM is an ideal tool to measure directly the molecular force from 0.1 pN up to micronewtons between two surfaces or even single molecules. On approach of the AFM probe tip to the sample, the force-distance curve can be used to characterize surface properties, such as van der Waals and electrostatic forces, solvation, hydration, and compression-related steric forces [30] . The retraction force curves often show a hysteresis referred to as an adhesion \"pull-off\" event, which can be used to estimate the adhesion forces. Many experimental force data are now available in the literature, and theoretical models have been developed for the analysis of forces acting between two solid surfaces [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . In contrast, only a few publications have addressed force measurements of soft thin layers [37] such as thiol self-assembled monolayers [38] [39] [40] [41] and phospholipid bilayers [42] [43] [44] .",

            "text": "The complex structural dynamics of phospholipid bilayers are governed by temperature-dependent parameters such as average interfacial area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and disorder of the hydrophobic tails. Although SPBs differ from free-standing membranes such as those found in vesicles or liposomes, they serve as good models for biological membranes. The SPB can exist in several lamellar phases: gel phase, liquid-crystalline or fluid phase, subgel phase, and ripple phase [45] . Often, phase behavior is dominated by the main L \u03b2 -L \u03b1 (gel-fluid) transition. A large number of stable, metastable, and transient lamellar gel structures can be adopted by different lipids. For saturated phosphatidylcholines, such as 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), there are four recognized lamellar phases, namely, a liquidcrystalline phase (L \u03b1 ) or phases with ordered hydrocarbon chain arrangements, a ripple phase (P \u03b2 ), a gel phase (L \u03b2 ), and \"subgel\" or \"crystal\" phase (L c ) [46] . Phase-related bilayer properties have been examined using a variety of experimental techniques [47] [48] [49] [50] . The phase transition from the gel phase to the liquidcrystalline phase is shown schematically in Fig. 21 .1. Physical properties of lipids such as density and thickness have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry, pressure calorimetry or dilatometry, and densitometry and other methods [51, 52] . Temperature-dependent AFM studies allow for visualizing these phase transitions and provide valuable information about changes in structural and physical properties of bilayers during phase transitions. Temperature-dependent AFM studies involving imaging bilayers have been reported [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . In addition, we have examined the force measurements as a function of temperature [58] .",

Phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and distilled, nanopure water were used in the preparation of all vesicles. Freshly cleaved ASTMV-2 quality, scratchfree ruby mica (Asheville-Schoonmaker Mica) was used as the solid support.

Aliquots of The fluid  phase domains correspond to  a lower thickness than the  gel-phase domains the vesicle solution were deposited on freshly cleaved pure mica. After a controlled period of time the mica was gently rinsed with nanopure water. Surfaces were imaged with an atomic force microscope (Pico SPM, Molecular Imaging) equipped with an AFMS-165 scanner. The nominal spring constants of Au-Cr-coated MAClevers used were approximately 0.6 N/m. The tip radius of curvature was typically 25 nm. The scan rate was 20 \u03bcm/s. All imaging and force measurements were performed in a liquid cell under nanopure water. For temperature-dependence experiments the temperature was varied from 22 to 65 \u2022 C, within 0.1 \u2022 C accuracy with a 1 \u2022 C/min ramp.",

The topography images ( Fig. 21. 2) show the typical formation of lipid domains during the phase transition. In Fig. 21 .2, panel A, a DPPC bilayer is in the gel phase, L \u03b2 , at 22 \u2022 C. When sample was heated, several phase transitions were observed as a function of increasing temperature: a broad main transition was observed at 42-52 \u2022 C, and another transition at 53-60 \u2022 C within the fluid phase. The first transition, at 42-52 \u2022 C, is attributed to the main L \u03b2 -L \u03b1 transition, and the second transition, between 53-60 \u2022 C, to the formation of a fluid disordered phase, perhaps with interdigitated or partly interdigitated lipid chains. Slowly cooling the system back showed that the two higher-temperature transitions at 42-52 and 53-60 \u2022 C are reversible and that the bilayer can be restored to its initial thickness [61] . A DOPC bilayer, which exists in a fluid phase at room temperature, when heated shows thickness reduction as well as an increase in surface coverage [62] , but no domain formation. Previous studies have established the L \u03b2 -L \u03b1 phase transition temperature for DPPC at 41 \u2022 C [63] . The presence of two broad transitions that we observed on supported bilayers can be attributed to the effect of the mica support and to separating the phase transitions showing a phase transition in a 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer. A DPPC bilayer at room temperature, 22 \u2022 C. B DPPC bilayer with excess of halothane (60 \u03bcl) [57] . C 50 \u2022 C-melting transition [61] .

We have shown that changes in bilayer thickness induced by halothane are similar to the first melting transition [58] . For a DPPC SPB containing halothane, only one transition at 52-60 \u2022 C was evident during heating and cooling. The presence of halothane changes the structural properties of the bilayer in such a way that the other transitions observed for the pure bilayer are not possible. We assume that in the presence of halothane, the water interface layer is disturbed by halothane molecules, thus eliminating the low-temperature transition. In spite of the visual similarity between an anesthetic-induced domain formation ( Fig. 21.2, panel B ) and the heat-induced gel-liquid phase transition ( Fig. 21. 2, panel C), observed by AFM imaging, the mechanism of anesthetic action is likely to be different from the effect of membrane melting.

The force required to detach the tip from the bilayer increased from 3 nN at 36 \u2022 C to 10 nN at 50 \u2022 C. In addition, the jump out of the contact was not abrupt, compared with that for a \"solid-like\" surface (i. e., mica). The distance the tip travels before it separates from the surface increased with increasing temperature. As van der Waals forces are known to vary only slightly with temperature, the change in the profile must be due to tip-bilayer interactions that depend on the bilayer phase. Incorporation of halothane into DPPC also leads to a significant change in the force profile. As a bilayer adsorbed on mica is known to screen the van der Waals forces [66] , the huge adhesion force observed cannot originate solely from the van der Waals forces. This adhesion behavior can be compared with that observed in the phase transition on DPPC from the gel to the liquid crystal observed on increasing the temperature ( Fig. 21.3 , plots b and c). Halothane induces then a transition of the bilayer into the fluid phase in a similar manner as melting, and induces the increase in adhesion, although the adhesion with excess halothane was greater than the adhesion observed on pure DPPC at elevated temperature.",

This analysis allows one to correlate microscale changes in the bilayer physical properties with [58] the molecular structure and the mobility of individual lipid molecules. The lipids in biological membranes have a high lateral mobility since they can easily exchange their positions. The fluidity of the membrane can be then thought of as the lateral motion of the constituents of the membranes. This fluidity should depend on the chain length and the composition of the membranes.

Most studies on the bilayer report a jump corresponding to the piercing of the bilayer for forces ranging from approximately 3 to 25 nN [71] [72] [73] . This jump into contact is observed when the force gradient exceeds the spring constant of the cantilever k, which is the case when k < 1 N/m. Although the force sensitivity can be altered, a high cantilever spring constant (k = 30 N/m) was chosen for monitoring all the data during the penetration. The force gradient attributed to the layer indentation was measured to be around 10 N/m and the force needed to puncture the lipid bilayer is in good agreement with that found in other studies.",

The lipid chain behaves like rubber (low elasticity), and this behavior is related to the change of entropy (increase of order when one presses the layer). It results in the property that the cell membranes can be easily deformed in the plane but do not resist the expansion (distance between the headgroup cannot vary more than 2%).

The transition between the electrostatic regime and the steric regime where the tip is at the top of the bilayer can be an effective way to estimate the bilayer thickness. At 22 \u2022 C, a transition occurs at D = 4 nm, corresponding to a thickness L = D/0.9 = 4.5 nm, which agrees with what is known from the literature (4.7 nm). With increasing temperature, the magnitude and the range of the steric force decrease contrary to the change in the electrostatic force. The steric force in a fluid phase, at elevated temperatures, is reduced by 50% compared with that a gel phase, as in Fig. 21 .5. This can be explained by the reduction in the tail density with temperature. The tail density is reduced from 1/50 to 1/67.1 (considering an area per lipid of 50\u00c5 2 at room temperature and 67.1\u00c5 2 at 65 \u2022 C [75] [76] [77] ), which makes 25% of difference and therefore a change of 40% in the force. In a fluid regime, i. e., at T > 50 \u2022 C, the shape of the steric part of the force-distance curve starts to depart from an exponential dependence and is similar to the linear abrupt jump observed for a fluid-phase DOTAP bilayer at room temperature.

This correlation permits evaluation of a bilayer fluidity and is in a good agreement with imaging data. Therefore, adhesion forces depend on the physical properties of the bilayer, and force analysis gives important information on the nature of the bilayer. In the repulsive part of the force plot using a steric force model also provides an important insight into the properties of the bilayer and ability of lipids to resist compression. Steric forces reduce with the temperature increase for the DPPC bilayer and correlate well with low steric forces for the fluid-phase DOPC bilayer at room temperature. In general, a fluid-phase bilayer can be characterized by the reduced repulsive forces, compared with the gel-phase bilayer.

It forms a molecular film at the interface of the hydrated lung epithelium with the air and thereby reduces the surface tension of the interface to near zero. This is required for normal respiration and structural stability of the lung. In adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), surfactant function fails. As a result, the lung is less compliant, the gas exchange area is reduced, and blood oxygenation is strongly decreased. The surfactant film is also the first barrier of airborne particles in polluted air. When inhaled, ultrafine particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 100 nm or less produce a major health threat. They cross the surfactant film, cross the lung epithelium, and enter the bloodstream. We describe force spectroscopy experiments aimed at a better understanding of surfactant failure in ARDS. Force spectroscopy was used to study the interactions between airborne particles and the surfactant. Particles (modeled by an atomic force microscope tip) interact with the surfactant film before they get into close contact because of the electrical surface potential of the film. This interaction depends on surface potential, which is locally strongly variable, depending on the film composition. We have shown that the ability of surfactant to reduce surface tension is associated with a distinct molecular architecture of the surfactant film. The functional pulmonary surfactant forms a pattern of molecular monolayer areas and areas of lamellar stacks, cross-linked to the monolayer at the air-aqueous interface (Fig. 21.7a) . We recently found that cholesterol in excess of a physiological proportion abolishes surfactant function, and surfactant fails to lower the surface tension upon compression [78] . This failure of function is associated with a change in the molecular architecture [79] . The formation of multilayer stacks, which is a characteristic feature of functional surfactant, does not occur in the presence of excess cholesterol.",

Phosphatidylcholines represent 80% of its mass with half of the phosphatidylcholines being the disaturated DPPC. Between 5 and 10 mass % is the negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol, and two hydrophobic surfactant-associated proteins (SP-B, SP-C). BLES in nonbuffered normal saline (pH 5-6) with a phospholipid concentration of 27 mg/ml was a kind gift from the manufacturer (BLES Biochemical, London, ON, Canada). Cholesterol was purchased from Sigma Chemicals. A solution of 1:1:1 methanol, chloroform, and BLES by volume was first vortexed and then spun at 100g for 5 min. The methanol-water phase was discarded and the BLES in chloroform was retained and either 5 or 20% of cholesterol (by mass) with respect to phospholipids in chloroform was added. Each solution was then dried under N 2 and resuspended with Goerke's buffer [140 mM NaCl, 10 mM N-(2hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N -ethanesulfonic acid and 2.5 mM CaCl 2 ; pH 6.9] to obtain an aqueous suspension of BLES and cholesterol at a concentration of 27 mg/ml phospholipids. BLES solutions were spread at the air-liquid interface. Supported planar monolayers on mica were prepared using Langmuir-Blodgett technique and transferred on mica support when films were compressed to a surface tension of 25 mN/m. Supported films were imaged in air using a NanoWizard atomic force microscope from JPK Instruments, Germany. All measurements were performed at 25 \u2022 C, over five different velocities, collecting each time ten force curves. Silicon cantilevers from Micromash, Spain, were used with cantilever spring constants of 0.6 and 0.7 N/m as determined by a thermofluctuation method using JPK SPM software.

The increase in the adhesion force for a bilayer as compared with a monolayer may be understood by an increase in the contact area between the AFM probe and the sample at a given load. BLES with 20% cholesterol shows the lowest adhesion force, compared with monolayer and multilayer areas of BLES with 5% cholesterol. This indicates that adhesion properties of the film were considerably altered by the incorporation of 20% cholesterol, decreasing adhesive interaction, and increasing the rigidity of the film. The lipid molecules are not mobile enough in the presence of 20% cholesterol and cannot be easily rearranged around the tip to increase the contact area and adhesion force. The increased rigidity of the film and decreased adhesion that we observed may play an important role in preventing the monolayer-bilayer conversion.",

Both models we used fit the experimental data well, showing the presence of electrostatic interactions in the net force measured between the tip and the sample. To better fit the experimental data we varied the charge on the atomic force microscope tip and the size of the charged disks, R 0 , which experimentally corresponds to the size of domains already observed with both AFM and Kelvin probe force microscopy imaging.

This confirms the important role of cholesterol-it produced small domains which differ by electrostatic potential, initially invisible with AFM, which causes the increase in the total electrostatic force. These findings correlate with the results of molecular dynamics simulations [82] , where cholesterol was shown to order individual lipids adjacent to cholesterol molecules, but abolished the long-range cooperativity between lipids, characteristic for the gel phase with true latticelike spatial order, and altered the lipid electrostatic potential [83] .

Unlike larger particles, ultrafine particles reach the peripheral lung and are able to cross the various barriers of the lung, including the lipid-protein layer of pulmonary surfactant at the air-alveolar interface and the cell membranes of the epithelial and endothelial cells underneath and reach the bloodstream [86] [87] [88] [89] . The toxicity of inhaled nanoparticles entering the body through the lung is thought to be initially defined by the electrostatic and adhesive interaction of the particles with the wall of the lung, and lung epithelial cells. Because of their substantial uptake, ultrafine particles are also of great interest for delivery of drugs to the peripheral lung and the body. Despite the importance of the early penetration steps in the biological effects of inhaled particles, the nature of the interactions with the various barriers of the lung remain poorly understood. A detailed study, therefore, promises substantial progress in the understanding of the health threat posed by fine and ultrafine air pollutants and the effectiveness of drug delivery by aerosols. The adhesive interaction includes electrostatic, van der Waals, steric, and hydrophobic forces as well as the line tension between particle, cell, and aqueous medium and depends on the elastic and plastic properties of the cell. The free energy due to these interactions will be minimized upon particle wetting by the lining layer. The lower the surface free energy of the particle, the less it will be wetted by the cell. A thermodynamic model using the \"wettability criterion\" was indeed successful in predicting passive particle uptake by cells [90] . Another thermodynamic analysis combined with a molecular dynamics simulation found negative line tension values for nanometer-sized particles, but positive values for those an order of magnitude larger [91] . The engulfment of particles in the nanometer range by unbalanced capillary forces was first suggested by Shanahan [92] .",

A cantilever spring constant lower than or similar to that of the cell is preferable. In this case, we can assume that the contact point corresponds in the trace force curve to the first upward deflection. After the tip has come into the contact with the cell, D becomes the penetration depth h of the tip into the cell. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the sample from the approach force profile, the Sneddon model was employed [26, 96] . Note that the use of macroscopic physical law should be reserved for homogeneous bulk materials. Young's modulus should be viewed as an effective parameter to analyze the trend of the in-plane organization of supramolecular structures. The effective parameter can differ from one experiment to another. A more sophisticated approach was to model the mechanical response of the cell membrane explicitly taking into account the mechanics of the cell membrane and that of the underlying cytoskeleton [97] . As the penetration depth h can reach 1 \u03bcm, the tip shape must be considered as a function of h. The effective Young's modulus, E , was estimated point by point for h considering the three regions determined by the geometry of the tip [98] .",

At first, the tip experienced a layer of increasing stiffness to a penetration depth of about 100 nm, at which point the resistance of the cell to penetration reached a maximum. Thereafter the cell became more compliant again. The stiff layer may represent the outer layer of the cytoskeleton anchored to the cell membrane. The Young's modulus of the membrane can be thought of as the surface tension of the membrane (0.5 N/m) divided by the thickness of the membrane (around 10 nm), i. e., a pressure of around 50 MPa. The lipid head is responsible Fig. 21.11 . When analyzing the approach curve, one can determine the Young's modulus of the sample surface. Young's modulus, which gives a measure of cell elasticity in our case, was found to depend on indentation depth, showing two distinctive parts of the plot: when the peripheral part of the cell was penetrated, up to about 100 nm into the cell, the cell became increasingly stiffer. The stiffness then dropped sharply upon further penetration until it leveled out after penetration to about 200 nm deep At time zero, the indentation was about 500 nm. Over time, the tip first penetrated rapidly and then slowly from 500 to 1300 nm. This is evidence of a time-dependent response of the cell to the tip. Bottom: Adhesion energy as a function of time. The tip was kept in contact with the cell at a constant load of 200 pN. The longer the tip stays in contact with the cell, the larger the adhesion that is observed. Statistical analysis shows that considerable changes occur during the first 100 s, after which the mean value of the adhesion energy no longer changes for crystalline elasticity, i. e., the change in the head-to-head distance can change (high elasticity but low rupture). The lipid chain behaves with rubber elasticity (low elasticity), which is related to the change of entropy (increase of order upon pressure). It results in the properties that the cell membranes can be easily deformed in the plane but do not resist the expansion (increase between the headgroup cannot vary more than 2%).",

The point of the initial contact between the tip and the cell surface, h 1 , was determined from the approach part of the force curve; h 2 corresponds to the last jump out of contact. Upon the penetration into the cell, the adhesion energy also increases. This indicates that the tip becomes engulfed by the membrane and the area of interaction increases (Fig. 21.12 ). Our results suggest that the process of particle uptake by lung epithelial cells occurs over approximately 100 s. This appears to be the time necessary for the nanoparticle to increase its surface area in contact with the cell and, hence, its adhesive interaction. Other authors have also shown [103] that the increase in adhesion between a polystyrene sphere to mica with increasing load or contact time is due to the plastic deformation. Load dependence and contact time dependence also indicate plastic and viscoelastic deformation [104] . A linear dependence of adhesion force on the reduced radius R eff = R 1 R 2 /(R 1 + R 2 ), where R 1 and R 2 are the radii of the two particles, was found by Heim et al. [105] .",
