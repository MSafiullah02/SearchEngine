He reportedly did not indicate travel to Western Africa and was discharged home the same day. Three days later, he was re-admitted due to clinical deterioration and tested positive for Lassa virus (LASV) infection. He succumbed to Lassa fever [2].A patient who was initially diagnosed with malaria was medically evacuated from Togo to Germany in March 2016. After his death, his body was retrospectively tested and found to be infected with LASV. The mortician who handled the corpse contracted the virus, developed Lassa fever, was administered experimental treatment with ribavirin and favipiravir and survived [3, 4].In August 2016, a man presented to a university hospital in Madrid, Spain, with a history of high fever, abdominal pain, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea. His clinical condition deteriorated, he developed multi-organ failure, and died in spite of intensive care treatment. All tests for routine infections were negative. Retrospectively, he was diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). A nurse who had assisted with the endotracheal intubation of the index patient contracted CCHFV, was treated with ribavirin, and survived [5].\n",

Staff managing dead bodies (e.g., morticians) are rarely trained at the same level as medical practitioners, although they may be exposed to the same risks. As for EVD, the highest viral loads can be found in dead bodies [45]. Having well-trained staff and PPE available is crucial. All procedures that involve any contact with the dead body and/or body fluids should be performed while wearing PPE. All avoidable procedures (e.g., embalming) should be avoided. The body should be placed in a body bag. Cultural sensitivities should be respected when handling a dead body as the evacuation of a dead body can be traumatizing for the population. For example, during the Western African EVD outbreak, burial teams were attacked [46]. Exact procedures for decontamination of the dead body, body bag, and surroundings as well as exact burial procedures depend on the causative pathogen. For example, Yersinia pestis, though sensitive in aerosols, can survive in carcasses for up to 2 months at 35 \u00b0C [47]. ICRC guidelines for dead body management in disaster contexts were updated recently [48]. A specific WHO dead body management/burial guideline for EVD is available [49].",

For example, during the Western African EVD outbreak, differences between PPE standards of WHO, CDC, MSF, and other actors were the subject of debate [50].The resources in terms of materials and qualified staff are different from place to place.National work security regulations differ (e.g., restricting duration of shifts).In the event of a possible bioweapons attack, the causative agent might be unknown (unknown pathogen or, even more complex, generally unknown chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear CBRN-spectrum agent) or multi resistant (example: multi-resistant Y. pestis). Particle sizes for different pathogens differ significantly, compromising the choice of the appropriate respirator. For example, if a chemical agent cannot be excluded in a scenario of a generally unknown CBRN-spectrum agent, a self-contained breathing apparatus should be considered.\n",

In practice, due to the complexity of donning, doffing, and decontaminating PPE, errors which compromised biosafety have been documented [51]. Furthermore, particular agents for decontamination (e.g., peracetic acid) cannot be used due to lack of filtering of chemical agents by FFP2/3 (or N95) respirators. Finally, because of the lack of ventilation, exhaustion due to heat is frequent and the wearing time thus limited [52].\nPowered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) is frequently used in European HLIU and, as for the EU, defined by EN standard 12,941 [53]. Depending on the exact type, they are mostly easy to don and doff. As ventilated equipment, PAPR is comfortable to wear, allowing longer working times [54]. Decontamination can be performed by, for instance, taking a shower with a decontaminating agent, provided that this agent is compatible with the filter chosen. However, PAPR is quite expensive and hence may not be available in resource-poor settings.\nSelf-Contained Breathing Apparatus is frequently used by fire brigades in Western countries (e.g., for intervening in smoky locations or those contaminated by chemical agents). This apparatus is heavy, complex to use, allows only very limited time of operation while wearing it, and is, according to national work security regulations, only to be used by staff who underwent a medical examination for aptitude. The choice of a self-contained breathing apparatus should hence be reserved to settings in which the presence of an agent leaking through the filters of other PPE (e.g. PAPR) cannot be excluded [54].\n",

In case of agents that are not communicable from person to person (e.g., Bacillus anthracis), standard droplet protection is required consisting of surgical masks, protective glasses/facial protection, and a gown while performing actions that involve aerosol exposure (e.g. suction of secretions). During pandemics, aerosol protection is required especially if the lethality of the disease is high relative to seasonal influenza. This protection includes surgical masks (to be replaced at least every 4 h); gowns over clothes; gloves to prevent contact with mucous membranes, blood secretions, and fluids; and protective goggles only when performing activities that pose a risk of spraying onto mucous membranes. In cases when aerosolization is likely, N95 masks are required (e.g., cases of airborne infection).

Out of 635 health care workers for whom the outcome was available, 418 (65.9%) died [62]. In total, three medically evacuated HCW were treated in HLIU in Germany in 2014, two of whom survived. The patients were administered experimental treatments and likely benefited from intensive care. Infection prevention and control was thoroughly maintained. Staff caring for the patients wore PAPR as PPE. Neither secondary infections nor imported cases occurred in Germany [17, 18]. In spite of this fortunate epidemiologic \u2018outcome\u2019, there was an emotional debate in Germany driven by fear [63]. Public health authorities made a tremendous effort to enhance emergency preparedness towards the disease, and an elaborate document \u2018Framework Ebola Virus Disease\u2019 was released led by Robert Koch Institute, Germany RKI [64]. A sophisticated medical evacuation airplane with resources for performing comprehensive intensive care measures aboard was designed, launched in November 2014 and, because of the end of the humanitarian crisis related to EVD, dismantled in [65, 66].2.\nLassa Fever in Germany 2015\n\n",

The influx of patients to the emergency departments (EDs) necessitates preparedness to expand surge capacities of the varied hospital facilities including the ED, intensive care units, inpatient departments, and laboratory capacities [71, 72]. Nevertheless, compared to natural disasters or other types of emergency situations, an HCID outbreak presents different challenges, as the patients do not necessarily present to the emergency departments simultaneously and for a short period of time but rather do so over a prolonged time span [65]. The patients may present a high risk for transmitting the infection and thus pose a risk for spreading the disease to the personnel or other patients that are hospitalized. Therefore, those managing the event need to take into account unique elements of surge capacity such as designated infrastructure and equipment (i.e., isolation facilities), communication measures, and means for infection control [65, 73].",

Although many countries have installed such measures that allow them safely to admit and treat patients infected with biological agents, only few of them have facilities that allow for a massive influx of such patients. It is therefore expected that the surge of patients presenting to the hospitals will significantly surpass the available isolation capacities [6, 88]. Considering the high cost of installing isolation facilities that comply with the strict requirements of suitability to manage HCID events, it stands to reason that the current infrastructure will not change dramatically. Accordingly, a modified mode of operation is needed to facilitate effectively the management of a mass casualty HCID event while maintaining the safety of the staff and other inpatients of the hospital, such as designating areas in the hospital that will service exclusively HCID patients.",

Hospital administrators should communicate to the staff the criticality of their tasks, the perception of their contribution as vital for saving lives and for the continuous functioning of the medical facility, and its significant impact on medical consequences [98]. Risk communication should also include reference to actions that were taken to preserve their health and safety, such as preventive measures (physical protection, isolation facilities, infection control means, or preventive medications). Communicating messages during an HCID event must be based on relaying accurate and trustworthy information, conveyed calmly to avoid the creation of confusion and panic, and respectfully regarding the diversity prevailing among the population, including persons with special needs [65, 99]. Both the medical teams and the public need to be updated continually concerning the HCID event, its development, and potential consequences, as a dynamic process, transparently and credibly [98, 100].",

Clear, easily understandable information should be distributed concerning questions such as who should seek medical care, who needs to be vaccinated, who should approach the hospital or alternative facilities, or what means should be used for evacuation to hospitals (e.g., ambulances or private cars) [102]. Use of a tele-information center is recommended to provide the concerned public with answers to their worries. Leaflets delineating answers to most frequently asked questions should be prepared, translated into languages of the major fractions of the local population. This information should be uploaded to the hospitals\u2019 websites to be readily available to all interested parties. Proficient spokespersons should be available to relay information and updated data to local media and, through them, to the population.

Risk assessment is vital for both planning and response phases to facilitate decision making and implementation of effective interventions [98, 109].
