In virology, the IEOP method has been employed in studies of myxoviruses (11), poxvirus (13), herpes simplex (25) and some plant viruses (17) . Recently, TSOTSOS (25) examined the possibilities of using IEOP for typing and subtyping of various viruses belonging to major groups. However, very few researchers have investigated the possibility of using IEOP as a method for detection of viral antibodies. The main advantages of IEOP over other serological methods would be its simplicity, speed, the possibility of testing simultaneously many specimens, and its modest requirements for reagents and equipment. Obviously, however, the assumption has been that this could not compensate for the insensitivity of the method in detection of. antibodies. Even so, IEOP modifications have been elaborated for screening of antibodies to influenza virus (4), California encephalitis virus (3), rubella virus (9) and measles virus (15) .

The most serious objection to HAI as a sero-ecological tool is its very broad reactivity. Cross reactions occur between viruses which are not even transmitted by the same vector, but which might nevertheless circulate within the same areas. We have shown, for the Norwegian arbovirus strains, as has already been demonstrated for other virus groups (25) , that IEOP is virus type and even subtype specific, and thus offers advantages over the HAI test in this regard for sereecological screenings. The low consumption of serum is another very important factor. In many instances very limited amounts of blood can be drawn from each individual of animal species that are to be investigated, and one often wishes to perform tests against more than one antigen.",
