Reduction of these MDROs would be influenced by 2 major factors: a decreased number of inpatients during the outbreak and environmental disinfection at the end of the outbreak. To assess the effects of environmental cleaning, we adjusted MDRO isolations with inpatient numbers and performed subgroup analysis according to the disinfection status. As a result, only Enterococcus spp and VRE showed statistically significant reductions and associations with environmental disinfection. Handwashing might temporally increase during the MERS outbreak and contribute to the reduction of VRE, but the significant decrease in cleaned wards and ICUs supports the effect of environmental cleaning. Considering that decreases in other MDROs were not associated with disinfected wards and ICUs, they may be more affected by a decreased admission of patients who may harbor MDROs rather than by the environmental cleaning itself. A decreased number of inpatients is likely to be associated with a reduced risk of MDRO isolation, and rapid recovery of MDRO detections within 2 months from the outbreak might reflect inflow from the outside. The overall use of antibiotics, another major factor that may affect MDRO acquisition,10 increased during the outbreak period, suggesting it might offset the reduction of MDROs.",

Previous studies evaluating environmental disinfection were designed to decontaminate rooms of patients known to be infected or colonized with MDROs.2, 3, 4 By evaluating a post-MERS outbreak environmental disinfection, we suggest that nontargeted, partial environmental disinfection also results in reduction of overall VRE burden. This finding supports implementation of environmental cleaning measures as a routine practice, especially in hematology or transplant wards where VRE would cause clinical infections.",
