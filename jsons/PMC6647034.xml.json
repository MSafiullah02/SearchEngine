            "text": "Dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a major guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) for GTPase-activating proteins, and is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells [1, 2]. It binds and activates Rac through its DOCK homology region domain (DHR) [2]. Activated Rac serves multiple functions downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and antigen and complement receptors, including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [3\u20138]. Numerous GEFs can activate Rac and their relative importance depends on the cell type, the ligand, and the downstream effector function in mice and humans [9]. In 2015, Dobbs et al. described five unrelated patients with early-onset invasive viral and bacterial infections caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in DOCK2 [10]. Recently, Alizadeh et al. reported a sixth patient with the same phenotype [11]. The different mutations resulted in absent or markedly reduced levels of DOCK2 protein expression or in expression of a truncated protein lacking the DHR2 domain. Several immunological abnormalities have been documented in DOCK2-deficient patients. These include na\u00efve T cell lymphopenia with reduced T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and diminished T cell proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin, variable reduction of B cell numbers, with defective antibody responses despite normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels, and impaired NK cell function. Total polymerized filamentous actin (F-actin) was diminished in T-, B-, and NK lymphocytes, and T- and B cell chemotaxis was also impaired by DOCK2 deficiency [10]. Interferon (IFN)-alpha and -lambda production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from DOCK2-deficient patients was reduced after ex vivo exposure to herpes simplex virus 1 or vesicular stomatitis virus [10]. Moreover, DOCK2-deficient simian virus 40 fibroblasts showed increased viral replication and enhanced virus-induced cell death after exposure to encephalomyocarditis virus. Three of the six published patients succumbed to infection (Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis, viral pneumonitis, and persistent CMV infection); the other three were successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Thus, autosomal recessive (AR) DOCK2 deficiency results in a combined immunodeficiency (CID) with additionally impaired innate and cell-intrinsic immunity [10]. Overall, the phenotype of human AR DOCK2 deficiency is reminiscent of observations in Dock2\u2212/\u2212 mice [7, 12\u201314].",

The neutrophil chemotaxis and ROS production defects are more pronounced in Dock2/Dock5 double knockout mice [16]. Pre-treatment of human neutrophils with CPYPP, a small molecule inhibitor of the DHR-2 domain of DOCK proteins and thus of the Rac GEF activity of human DOCK2 and DOCK5, also significantly impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and ROS production [16]. However, to date, no data have been reported on phagocytic cell function in human primary AR DOCK2-deficient neutrophils. Here, we report a new kindred with AR DOCK2 deficiency with four affected children, and demonstrate that this condition is also characterized by neutrophil dysfunction.",

Under the hypothesis that the disease was inherited as an AR trait with complete penetrance and given the incidence of SCID, we looked for bi-allelic variants with a cutoff allele frequency of < 10\u22124 [26]. We identified a homozygous variant in DOCK2 (5:169267759; c.2704-2 A > C) located at an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide at the acceptor splice site of intron 26 as shown by multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1c) and a combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD, 23.8) was higher than the mutation significance cutoff (MSC; 3.313 for DOCK2). The effect of the identified variant was predicted to disrupt the acceptor site (position \u2212 2) of the start of exon 27 (Human Splice Finder and NNSPLICE 0.9) [27, 28]. The identified variant allele was not found in publicly available databases (dbSNP, ExAC, and gnomAD as assessed in June 2018) or in the Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases Lab in-house database of 4500 WES from patients with severe infections. Furthermore, the variant identified in this kindred was distinct from those detected in the six patients with AR DOCK2 deficiency described to date (Fig. 1d, e, [10, 11]). The variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the clinical and immunological phenotype in the kindred (Fig. 1a).

Early-onset severe viral infections, T cell lymphopenia, and functional defects of T-, B- and NK cells are the predominant immunophenotype of DOCK2 deficiency (Table S1) [10, 11]. TRECs were absent in two of the patients reported by Dobbs et al. [10] and in index patient II.6. The DOCK2-deficient patients reported here all fulfill the diagnostic criteria of leaky SCID or Omenn syndrome. Thymic shadow was present on chest X-ray, whereas T cell lymphopenia in T\u2212B+/\u2212NK+ SCID conditions is usually associated with a small or undetectable thymus [31]. Two other (S)CID conditions with detectable thymus, Coronin-1A deficiency [22, 23, 25], and CD3\u03b4 deficiency [24] have been reported. Deficient emigration of mature thymocytes in response to CCL19 has been reported in organ cultures of Dock2\u2212/\u2212-deficient mice [7]. We hypothesize that the na\u00efve T cell lymphopenia in the presence of a thymus in DOCK2-deficient patients results at least in part from the impaired release of mature T cells from the thymus due to dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton. DOCK2 deficiency should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of SCID and of Omenn syndrome.",

The authors suggested that DOCK2 deficiency may also affect phagocytic cell function. Dock2\u2212/\u2212 mice are uniquely susceptible to Citrobacter rodentium infection, with impaired recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the infected organs, leading to death in a significant proportion of mice [32]. In one of the patients reported here, the extensive perianal dermatitis may allude to a potential phagocyte dysfunction. The nephrotic syndrome and the massive pulmonary inflammation with hemorrhage and ARDS upon engraftment were also particular, though a clear link with neutrophil dysfunction prior to HSCT is unclear. Nevertheless, the present study shows that human DOCK2 deficiency leads to impaired F-actin polymerization and shape change in neutrophils in response to chemoattractants. These processes are essential for neutrophil chemotaxis and migration. Due to sampling limitations, we were unable to perform in vitro chemotaxis assays with neutrophils, but it is likely that these would also be impaired. Indeed, similar results have been reported in Dock2\u2212/\u2212 mice and in human neutrophils treated with the DOCK2/5 inhibitor CPYPP [16].",

On the other hand, the DHR assay in DOCK2-deficient neutrophils and monocytes from patient II.6 was normal in response to PMA (Fig. 4b, Fig. S1). It is important to realize that the DHR assay is a screening assay of respiratory burst activity and not an absolute measurement of hydrogen peroxide production, even more so when using only PMA as a stimulus [33]. The patient was off steroids at the time of sampling. Moreover, the decreased cytochrome c reduction in EBV-B cells suggests that the defect in respiratory burst activity in the patient\u2019s neutrophils is a not a secondary event. The description of NADPH oxidase in EBV-B cells and monocytes next to neutrophils is relevant as there may be differential expressivity of a phenotype depending on the cell type studied.",

            "text": "Rac-GTP is part of the assembled NADPH oxidase complex, which acts as a molecular switch to activate one of the oxidase subunits, p67phox (NCF2) [34, 35]. Thus, impaired activation of Rac in absence of DOCK2 leads to reduced NADPH oxidase activity by affecting the catalytic activity of the enzyme. We can also presume that due to incomplete activation of Rac and perhaps other small GTPases, the cytoskeleton rearrangement may differ in DOCK2-deficient neutrophils and EBV-B cells as compared to control cells, leading to impaired accumulation of active NADPH oxidase complexes at the cell surfaces and giving rise to the observed impaired respiratory burst at least in vitro. How/if the cytoskeleton regulates enzyme assembly is less well understood. Another possible explanation is the site of O2\u2212 detection. DHR is oxidized intracellularly, whereas all other assays used for this project detect oxidase activity extracellularly [30]. Altogether, these data support a role for DOCK2 and the DOCK2-Rac axis and the actin cytoskeleton in the O2\u2212 forming respiratory burst activity following stimulation of GPCRs. Unfortunately, we were not able to study the respiratory burst activity in response to other stimuli due to the patient\u2019s critical clinical situation and start of conditioning regimen. Indeed, NADPH oxidase activity in response to complement opsonized bacteria may well be normal as these stimuli are expected to activate VAV family and other GEFs via non-G protein-coupled receptors [4, 9]. The clinical phenotype in DOCK2 deficiency is far less suggestive of neutrophil dysfunction than the phenotype of patients with dominant negative mutations in RAC2, who present with omphalitis and soft tissue abscesses, probably due to the dominant negative RAC2 protein affecting also the GTPase activity of the ubiquitously expressed RAC1 [34\u201337]. Interestingly, the neutrophil dysfunction phenotype was also modest in two patients with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in RAC2 [38]. Nevertheless, it is prudent to take the at least partially impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and respiratory burst activity into account in DOCK2-deficient patients. Finally, the finding of neutrophil dysfunction in human DOCK2 deficiency confirms the impact of deleterious mutations in genes related to the actin cytoskeleton on the normal function of human myeloid and lymphoid immune cells [8, 34\u201337, 39\u201346].",

Circles represent female members and squares male members. A slash through a symbol represents a deceased person. Electropherograms represent Sanger sequencing for evaluation of the segregation of the identified DOCK2 mutation within the family. Patient II.6 is the index patient (indicated with arrow). WT: wild-type, M: mutant, E?: no genetic diagnosis. Panel b pictures the presence of a normal-sized thymus as visualized by post-natal chest X-ray in II.6. Panel c shows the evolutionary conservation of the nucleotide (red) affected by the identified DOCK2 mutation. Nucleotides in light gray show changes compared to H. sapiens nucleotide sequence (Chr 5: 169267755\u2013169267763). Panel d presents a graphic overview of allele frequency and CADD score of published and identified DOCK2 mutations. MSC: mutation significance cutoff. Patients (P1\u2013P5) published in [10] and P6 published in [11] (green: frameshift mutations, blue: missense mutations). P7\u20139 represent patients described in this study (red). Panel e presents a schematic picture of DOCK2 protein domains and synopsis of disease-causing DOCK2 mutations [10, 11], green: frameshift mutations, blue: missense mutations; this study, red: splice region mutation.
