The age range was 3 months to 22.5 years (mean, 6.1 \u00b1 4.7 y; median 5.3 y). The patients were divided into two groups: Group I (n = 106, 80%) included patients who had exhibited primary or secondary immunodeficiency and Group II (n = 26, 20%) included patients who were immunosuppressed after BMT. To provide more detail, the diagnoses and characteristics of the patients in Groups I and II are presented in Table 1.\nPatients in Group I\nIn radiological evaluations prior to FB, consolidation in 31/106 patients, atelectasis in 54/106 patients, diffuse/local nodular infiltration in 19/106 patients, interstitial infiltration in 9/106 patients, a ground\u2010glass appearance in 14/106 patients and bronchiectasis in 17/106 patients were detected. Normal findings were present in the remaining 3/106 patients. Some patients had more than one radiological finding; there were 65/106 patients with only one finding, 35/106 patients with any two of them and 3/106 patients with three of them (detailed radiological results are given in the supplementary table).The macroscopic evaluation of FB provided findings consistent with infection in 70 patients (66%), tracheomalacia was observed in 11 patients, bronchomalacia in 8 patients, airway anomaly in 9 patients, mucosal hyperemia or hemorrhage in 9 patients and normal findings were present in 18 patients.In the microscopic evaluations of BAL, a microbiological agent was detected in 62 patients (58.4%) (Table 2), among which 15 patients exhibited multiple agents (detailed microbiological results are given in the supplementary table). The most common agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20) both independently as well as along with other agents.Patients in Group II\nThe radiological evaluations for Group II revealed consolidation in 4/26 patients, atelectasis in 8/26 patients, diffuse/local nodular infiltration in 8/26 patients, diffuse interstitial infiltration in 4/26 patients, a ground\u2010glass appearance in 5/26 patients, bronchiectasis in 1/26 patients and normal findings were present in the remaining 1/26 patient. There were 20/26 patients with only one finding and 5/26 patients with any two of them (detailed radiological findings are given in the supplementary table).Macroscopically in the FB, 17 (65.3%) patients had purulent secretion, 2 patients had tracheomalacia, 2 (7.6%) patients had an airway anomaly, 2 (7.6%) patients had hemorrhage and 5 (19.2%) patients presented as macroscopically normal.The BAL results revealed microbiological agents in 14/26 patients (53.8%), among which, 2 patients had multiple agents. Although no statistically significant difference was determined for microbiological agents in this group, viral agents were the most common. The microbiological agents detected in the BAL are provided in Table 2.Comparisons of microbiological and radiological findings of patients in Group I and Group II (Table 3)\nBacterial pathogens were more prevalent in Group I than in Group II (P = .008), but the results revealed no difference between two groups in regard to the presence of fungi, TB, viruses and PJP.Additionally, no difference was detected between the groups based on the radiological findings (atelectasis, consolidation, nodular infiltration, interstitial infiltration, ground glass and bronchiectasis).One of our aims was to determine the role of radiological findings in predicting the causative pathogen group. When all of the patients were considered together, a significant association was determined between the presence of viral pathogens (including CMV) and the radiological findings of interstitial infiltration and/or a ground\u2010glass appearance (P = .003). However, no significant association existed between the radiological findings and the presence of bacterial or fungal pathogens. In the BAL sample, 14 of 71 patients (19.7%) who were able to be tested for viral agents by a PCR method were found to be positive for viral agents. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71.4%) had interstitial infiltration and a ground\u2010glass appearance. Likewise, 41 of 57 patients (71.9%) with a negative result on the viral PCR study did not have interstitial infiltration and/or a ground\u2010glass appearance. The predictive values of the aetiologic agent based on the radiological findings are provided in Table 4.An evaluation of all diagnostic methods related to FB (macroscopic pathologic findings and demonstration of a microbial agent in BAL) revealed a diagnostic finding in 86 of 132 patients (65.1%). The antimicrobial treatment changed for 75/132 patients (56.8%); it was escalated based on the identified pathogenic agent in 67 of these 132 patients (50.7%):\nGanciclovir was given to 10 patients because of pulmonary CMV infection,Anti\u2010TB treatment was started in 2 patients,A new antibacterial was added for 45 patientsA new antifungal was added for 10 patients\n",

In the last 5 years, three retrospective studies have been conducted in similar patient groups. In a study published in 2016, the results of 123 patients (75 of them had BMT) who had undergone FB because immunodeficiency and lung findings were reported.15 Two other studies published in 2017 and 2018 reported the FB and BAL results of 71 adult patients diagnosed with ALL16 and 117 children17 with immunodeficiency. In these studies, treatment changes occurred in 74%, 27% and 73% of patients whose BAL samples were positive for microbiological studies, respectively. Likewise, treatment changes were also reported in 65.8%, 17% and 56%, respectively, of the patients whose BAL samples were negative for pathogenic agents. In our study, among all patients whose treatment was changed, 67/75 patients (89.3%) had their treatment increased, whereas only 8/75 patients (10.7%) had their treatment modified to narrow their current treatment (Table 5). In the overwhelming majority of the patients in Group I, the rate of therapy escalation (n = 57, 90.5%) was more prominent, especially the addition of antibiotics (43/57 vs 2/10 patients), because bacterial pathogens were more prevalent in Group I than in Group II (P = .008). Bacterial diversity was high in BAL results and the antimicrobial agents at the time of FB did not cover most pathogens. Other recent reports investigating treatment changes also showed higher escalation as compared to de\u2010escalation17 and continuation of treatment with nontargeted agents following negative BALs (56.7%)15, although these differences were not as high as the rates we found. We explain this slight discrepancy because in our immunosuppressed population, after observable positive BAL results, adding therapy seems reasonable, but the cessation of antimicrobial agents is more difficult in this critical population. In addition, we included patients who changed from prophylaxis to a treatment dose for some antibiotics (such as trimethoprim\u2010sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin\u2010sulbactam) and lengthening the duration of current treatment as a treatment change and this would count as an additive effect to our escalation rate. Additionally, these findings point out the overuse of antibiotics and the tendency to continue their use, even in cases without any objective evidence supporting their use.",

We determined that in the BMT group there were fewer bacterial agents than in the group with other immunodeficiencies, but no difference appeared for other aetiological agents. These results may be related to the protective effect of prophylactic antibiotics that had been administered since the beginning of the BMT process as well as the preparation regimens that cause T\u2010cell depletion in order to prevent the occurrence of graft versus host disease, both of which may play a critical role in the increased frequency of the presence of viral and opportunistic agents in BMT patients. Our results also revealed that bacterial agents, in particular, S. pneumoniae, which is recognised as the most common cause of community\u2010acquired pneumonia in patients with immunodeficiency other than BMT, are also extremely important agents to be reviewed.",

Importantly, the lack of an expected pathogen because immune dysregulation may have also been the reason for this finding. Studies in recent years on the role of radiological findings in detecting infectious agents have only specified opacities, nodules and a ground\u2010glass appearance as being associated with a pathogenic factor.16 In addition, Rizik et al.17 evaluated 117 children with immunodeficiency and determined that although BAL results led to a treatment change in 63% of the cases, the type of radiological findings (focal or lobar vs diffuse, age >1 vs <1) was not ultimately associated with any treatment change.",

According to the data from our study, it is recommended that viral investigations be initiated at an early period of treatment as well as to start early antiviral treatment in patients who present with a ground\u2010glass appearance on the HRCT. Additionally, we recommend that these findings continue to be investigated in studies with larger patient group cohorts.",
