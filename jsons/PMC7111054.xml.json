Modes of transmission\nSeveral classes of pathogens can cause infection, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and prions. The modes of transmission vary by type of organism and some infectious agents may be transmitted by more than one route: some are transmitted primarily by direct or indirect contact, (e.g., Herpes simplex virus [HSV], respiratory syncytial virus, Staphylococcus aureus), others by the droplet, (e.g., influenza virus, B. pertussis) or airborne routes (e.g., M. tuberculosis).\nPage 18: Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis110, influenza virus23, adenovirus111, rhinovirus104, Mycoplasma pneumonia112, SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV)21,96,113, group A streptococcus114, and Neisseria meningitidis95,103,115.\nPage 17: For example, although S. aureus is transmitted most frequently by the contact route, viral upper respiratory tract infection has been associated with increased dispersal of S. aureus from the nose into the air for a distance of 4 feet under both outbreak and experimental conditions and is known as the \u201ccloud baby\u201d and \u201ccloud adult\u201d phenomenon118\u2010120.\n\n",
