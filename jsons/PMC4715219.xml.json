Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissues were collected from archival tissues from autopsy tissues or lung donors, whereas archival nasal tissues (n = 3) were collected from biopsy samples. Portions of the cases also had trachea or primary bronchi (large airways) available for examination. These were scored for DPP4 immunostaining and compared to small airways defined by intrapulmonary bronchi and bronchioles (Table 1). We gathered sufficient lung samples to compare 2 clinical groups (Table 2). Group 1 was composed of 16 healthy lung tissues (defined as lacking clinical evidence of active or chronic lung disease), whereas group 2 was composed of chronic lung disease tissues defined by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, n = 4) or cystic fibrosis (CF, n = 8) clinical diagnoses. The use of a control population (group 1), even though healthy and often younger, allows several advantages. It provides a control group for comparison to the diseased individuals (group 2). Furthermore, our total pool of cases ranged from 2 months to 76 years of age, allowing evaluation of age-related changes in DPP4 expression (Table 3).",

Scoring of DPP4 immunostaining in type I and type II (Figure 6, A and B) cells was significantly increased in group 2 lungs (Table 2). Alveolar macrophages also had a similar significant increase in staining for group 2, but neutrophils in both groups consistently lacked DPP4 (Figure 6C). In addition, we observed that groups 1 and 2 had differences in mean age (Table 2), which could possibly contribute to the increased DPP4 scores for type I and type II cells. To address this, we further examined the significant parameters in Table 2 to determine whether there were correlations in the scores with progressive age (Table 3). Although there were no significant correlations between the scores of type I cells and increased age, type II cells had a negative correlation in group 1 (r = \u22120.4887, P = 0.0001) but lacked a significant correlation when groups 1 and 2 were combined (Table 3). These findings suggest that increased DPP4 scores are not age related but most likely responses to chronic lung disease. An additional question of interest is whether female or male sex contributed to the changes in DPPP4 expression. We detected no significant sex-specific changes in DPP4 expression in alveolar type II cells or alveolar macrophages (Figure 6, D and E).",

Our finding of nominal DPP4 expression in the conducting airways is consistent with a report by van der Velden et al,27 who investigated DPP4 expression in human bronchus from healthy individuals and asthmatic patients and noted no localization in surface epithelia but robust expression in submucosal gland epithelia. We detected DPP4 expression on cells within the lung parenchyma (eg, type I and II cells) and interstitium (endothelial cells) and on leukocytes (macrophages, mononuclear lymphoid cells). This finding might suggest that MERS-CoV exposure to airway epithelia could provide only a nominal or preliminary conduit for infection but is not a primary site for infection. This concept is consistent with the lack of evidence for airway centric disease in humans and animal models2, 3, 4, 29, 30 and may explain the poor transmissibility of MERS-CoV. In contrast, the submucosal glands exhibited robust DPP4 expression in serous epithelial cells and submucosal gland lumens, likely representing soluble DPP4 in secretions. Soluble DPP4 is present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and these levels are regulated independent of serum levels with the extracellular domain cleaved by sheddases, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, MMP-2, and MMP-14.25, 31 Soluble DPP4 is also detectable in pleural fluid.32 In some inflammatory lung conditions, such as smoking, bronchoalveolar lavage levels of soluble DPP4 are reduced,33 whereas in other settings, such as asthma, it is unchanged or increased.33, 34 Submucosal gland secretions normally bathe the airway surface, thus soluble DPP4 from submucosal glands and surface epithelia may bind to the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein. This has been speculated to competitively inhibit virus binding as reported in vitro.22 In contrast to the conducting airways, the lung parenchyma and interstitium were relatively rich in cellular sources of DPP4 protein. MERS-CoV infection of these pulmonary cell types would likely contribute to and be consistent with the reported parenchymal lesions observed on lung imaging, such as diffuse alveolar damage.1, 3",

Of interest, DPP4 expression in cells (eg, mesothelium, macrophages) was increased at sites of heterogeneous remodeling compared with healthy sites in the same lung. This finding, along with significant enhanced DPP4 expression scores in type I and type II cells (Tables 2 and 3), suggests that chronic lung disease may enhance DPP4 expression and perhaps make such individuals more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Schmiedl et al34 reported an increase in DPP4 tissue staining and activity in a rat model of asthma, indicating that some inflammatory conditions may increase the abundance of MERS-CoV receptor in the airways. It has been reported that patients with MERS and comorbidities, including smoking and COPD, have worse outcomes, suggesting such conditions predispose individuals to an increased susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection or disease progression.2, 3, 4, 7 In addition, it is interesting to consider how DPP4 expression on immune cells and vascular endothelia might contribute to MERS-CoV\u2013related disease. Both macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells express DPP4 and are susceptible to MERS-CoV entry. Monocyte-derived macrophages support productive MERS-CoV infection,35, 36 whereas plasmacytoid dendritic cells support virus entry and release cytokines and interferon in response to entry but do not allow the virus to complete its replication cycle.37 Chu et al38 reported that human T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood and from lymphoid organs can be infected by MERS-CoV. Of interest, MERS-CoV infection of T lymphocytes activated both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways.38, 39 In addition to alveolar macrophages and mononuclear cells, we found significant DPP4 immunostaining of endothelia of lymphatics and other vasculature. If these cell types or structures become infected, it is possible that this could contribute to MERS disease pathogenesis by facilitating spread to other organs.",

The catalytic action of DPP4 on substrate chemokines usually reduces the ligand's agonist properties. For example, DPP4-mediated cleavage of CXCL10 yields a dominant negative antagonist peptide product.44 It is currently not known whether severe infections such as MERS alter the abundance or function of DPP4 in the respiratory tract, but DPP4 could possibly influence the kinetics of inflammation entering the lung. It addition, there is recent evidence that DPP4 itself may act as a proinflammatory signaling molecule.45, 46",

They reported that the virus infected nonciliated bronchial epithelium, bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and endothelial cells.41 Hocke et al47 also used ex vivo organ cultures of human lung to study MERS-CoV cell tropism. They observed that MERS-CoV infected most cell types in the alveolar compartment and detected morphologic correlates of severe lung injury. Although ex vivo models are useful, it is possible that culture conditions may alter native DPP4 expression or other factors that influence cell susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. Several groups have reported that infection of airway epithelial cell lines with MERS-CoV elicits a range of transcriptional and protein responses, including antagonism of interferon responses, induction of STAT3 pathway genes, and differential expression of cytokines and chemokines.25, 48, 49, 50 It is not currently known how infection of endothelia, mesothelia, or immune cell types with MERS-CoV might influence disease outcomes.",

            "text": "This study has advantages and limitations. One advantage is that we used cell cultures and known positive tissue to optimize and validate the technique to maximize specificity and minimize nonspecific background that can easily confound localization studies. Another advantage is that we immunostained tissue from a range of healthy and diseased individuals to comprehensively investigate DPP4 distribution across all lung cell types. Other studies have used DPP4 activity\u2013based localization techniques51 in addition to immunolocalization25, 27 or in vitro culture of primary cells and cell lines.22, 52, 53 Of note, we found that tissues from patients with COPD and CF exhibited areas of enhanced DPP4 immunostaining in airway epithelia, type II epithelia, pleural mesothelia, and alveolar macrophages. A disadvantage of this study is that the tissues from disease states tended to be from older individuals, but this age difference did not appear to directly influence the study findings. Another limitation of this study is the relatively small number of cases in the COPD and CF groups. Even so, we identified significant trends from this cohort. Furthermore, small sample sizes of nasal tissue biopsies constrained the tissue area for examination compared with other tissues, and this small sampling could explain the absence of DPP4 staining in nasal surface epithelium compared with sparse staining in airway surface epithelium. We acknowledge that very little DPP4 expression may be required to confer susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection, and this could be below the level of detection with the optimized IHC technique. We also speculate that although the expression of DPP4 alone is sufficient to confer susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection in resistant cells,22 it is possible that there may be currently unknown cell-type specific co-factors, such as host proteases,54 that influence disease that we could not evaluate. In summary, the evidence of more prominent localization of DPP4 in parenchymal tissue may help explain why MERS is characterized by lower respiratory tract disease.",
