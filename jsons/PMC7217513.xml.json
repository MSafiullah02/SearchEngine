Some of the most widely studied problems include cascading failures in interdependent networks [1\u20136], simple contagions (e.g., disease propagation in human and animal populations [7\u201325], etc.), and complex contagions (e.g., diffusion of influence, beliefs, norms, and innovations in social networks [26\u201329]). Recently, the attention was shifted from single, isolated networks to multiplex and multilayer networks [17,18,29\u201343]. This shift is primarily driven by the observation that links in a network might be categorized according to the nature of the relationship they represent (e.g., friends, family, office mates) as well as according to the social network to which they belong (e.g., Google+ vs Facebook links), and each link type might play a different role in the dynamical process.",

In doing so, we adopt the content-dependent linear threshold model of social contagions proposed by Ya\u011fan and Gligor [29]. Their framework is a generalization of the linear threshold model introduced by Watts [28] and is based on individuals adopting a behavior when their perceived proportion of active neighbors exceeds a certain threshold; the key to that modeling framework is that one's perceived influence depends on the types of the relationships they have and the context in which diffusion is being considered. More precisely, each individual in the network can be in one of the two states, active or inactive. Each link type i is associated with a content-dependent weight ci in [0,\u221e] that encodes the relative importance of this link type in spreading the given content. Then, an inactive node with mi active neighbors and di\u2212mi inactive neighbors via type-i links turns active only if\n\u2211icimi\u2211icidi\u2265\u03c4,where \u03c4 is the node's threshold drawn from a distribution P(\u03c4).

However, their multiplex network model was formed by combining independent layers of networks (one for each link type), where each layer is generated by the configuration model [44,45].

In particular, we study the content-dependent linear threshold model in a multiplex network model where each link type (or network layer) is formed by the clustered random network model proposed by Newman [48] and Miller [56]. We solve for the critical threshold, probability, and expected size of global cascades and confirm our analytical results via extensive simulations. The main observation from our results is that clustering has a double-faceted impact on the probability and expected size of global cascades. Namely, we show that clustering decreases the probability and size of cascades when average degree in the network is small, whereas after a certain value of average degree, clustering is shown to facilitate cascades.",

There has been recent interest [30] in understanding whether monoplex projection of a multiplex network (obtained by ignoring the colors of edges and aggregating the layers) can still capture the essential properties (e.g., cascade threshold and size) of a diffusion process. In the affirmative, this would eliminate the need for considering the full multiplex structure of real-world systems in tackling similar problems. We show that even in the simplest case where all link types have the same influence weight (i.e., c1=c2=\u22ef), monoplex theory may not be able to capture contagion dynamics accurately, reinforcing the need for studying multiplex networks in its correct setup. We observe that the accuracy of monoplex theory in capturing cascade dynamics over multiplex networks depends tightly on the assortativity (i.e., correlation between the degrees of connected pairs) of the network. For instance, when assortativity is negligible, monoplex theory is seen to predict cascade dynamics very well, while in highly assortative cases its ability to predict contagion behavior diminishes significantly.",

It has been reported [18,28] many times that threshold models of complex contagion exhibit two phase transitions as the average degree increases; a second-order transition at low degrees marking the formation of a giant component of vulnerable nodes and a first-order transition at high degrees due to increased local stability of nodes. Here, we consider a multiplex where one layer has degree distribution Poi(\u03bb) while the degree in the second layer follows Poi(\u03bb/\u03b1) with probability \u03b1 and is zero with probability 1\u2212\u03b1. In this setting, we observe that in general there exist two intervals of \u03bb for which cascades are possible, amounting to four phase transitions as opposed to two; also, it is seen that only the first transition is second order while the remaining ones are first order. However, depending on the value of \u03b1, these regions may overlap (with overlap starting when \u03b1 exceeds a critical value) resulting again with only two phase transitions; see Sec. VI C for details.",

However, most social networks exhibit high clustering, informally known as the propensity of a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d to be one's friend. Put differently, real-world social networks are usually not treelike and instead have considerable number of cycles, particularly of size three; i.e., triangles.

Namely, an inactive node i with mi active neighbors and di\u2212mi inactive neighbors will become active only if mi/di exceeds \u03c4i drawn from a distribution P(\u03c4). More precisely, nodes update their states synchronously at discrete time steps t=0,1,\u22ef, and an inactive node will be activated at time t if the fraction of its active neighbors exceeds its threshold at time t\u22121; once active, a node can not be deactivated. A major concern with this model is that it assumes all links in the network have the same importance, irrespective of the context that the spreading is being considered. However, in real-world contagion processes, each link type (e.g., co-workership versus family or physical links versus online social network links) may play a different role in different cascade processes. For example, in the spread of a new consumer product amongst the population, a video game would be more likely to be promoted among high school classmates rather than among family members; the situation would be exactly the opposite in the case of a new cleaning product [58].",

We see that the probability and expected size of global cascades vary greatly as c changes. This can be taken as an indication that our model can capture the real-world phenomenon that over the same population certain contents can become widespread while others die out quickly. In the setting used here, we see that global cascades take place when the content parameter c is not too small or large. The reason is that with a too small or large content parameter, the connectivity of the conjoined network is dominated by only one of the two networks. So, if neither of them has enough connectivity to trigger a global cascade by their own, then there will be no global cascades in the conjoined network. When the c is neither too large nor too small (e.g., close to unity), both networks will contribute to the connectivity together and it becomes possible to trigger a global cascade. For other values of \u03bbr and \u03bbb, a completely different situation might occur, e.g., with very small or very large c promoting cascades; e.g., see [29, Fig. 2] for a few such examples.",

It is known [18,28] that threshold models of complex contagion exhibit two phase transitions as the average degree increases, a second-order transition at low degrees that marks the formation of a giant vulnerable component and a first-order transition at high degrees due to increased local stability of nodes, namely, due to the increased difficulty of activating high-degree nodes. Given that clustering is known to decrease the size of giant component [31], we expect that it will be more difficult for a clustered network to contain a giant vulnerable cluster. This is why the lower phase transition in complex contagions appear later (i.e., at larger degrees) as clustering increases. On the other hand, the cycles of size three (i.e., triangles) that are common in clustered networks can help trigger cascades when average degree is higher. For instance, in a treelike network a single active node can only activate its vulnerable connections. However, in a triangle, an active node may first activate one of its vulnerable connections, making it possible for the third node to be activated (which now has two active neighbors) even if it is not vulnerable. This is what pushes the second phase transition to higher degrees.",

A multiplex network is generated using the colored configuration model [64,65] where stubs that are of the same color are matched randomly. The monoplex projected theory ignores the color of the edges and matches all stubs randomly with each other.

One of the key differences between the two cases is the resulting assortativity. When \u03b1=0.1, only 10% of the nodes have red stubs, each of which can only be connected with other red stubs in the multiplex network case. Put differently, in this setting a small fraction of the population will have statistically higher degrees than the rest, and the additional links they have can only connect nodes with high degrees together. This leads to a positive correlation (i.e., assortativity) between the degrees of pairs of connected nodes. However, in the monoplex projection, the additional edges can be used to connect any two nodes, resulting with very little to no assortativity in the network. Obviously, when \u03b1 is close to one, almost every node will have the additional edges and the above phenomenon will not be observed. Our simulation results confirm this intuition as we see that assortativity is negligible (\u223c10\u22124) in both monoplex and multiplex cases when \u03b1=0.99, while with \u03b1=0.1, assortativity varies (as \u03bbr=\u03bbb increases) from 0.05 to 0.2 in the multiplex case while still being negligible in the monoplex case.",

In turn, this would make the prediction of cascade region more difficult in the cases where system parameters are not known exactly but estimated, e.g., social network applications. When \u03b1=0.1, only 10% of the nodes have red edges, but the the mean number of red edges for those nodes equals 10\u03bbb [see (14)]. Therefore, the first couple of phase transitions taking place at very small \u03bbb values can be attributed mainly to red edges. First, \u03bbb becomes large enough (e.g., gets to around 0.1) that the subnetwork induced only on the red edges contains a giant vulnerable cluster, giving rise to global cascades; note that at this point \u03bbb is so small that blue edges do not create enough local stability to prevent cascades from happening. However, after \u03bbb reaches a certain level (around 0.65), the subgraph on red edges, having average degree of 10\u03bbb, reaches the second phase transition point where cascades stop due to the increased local connectivity of nodes. These first two transitions being second and first order, respectively, also confirms that they are primarily due to the red edges.",

This interval is then followed by a region where \u03bbb is large enough that the subgraph on blue edges has a giant vulnerable cluster. However, the emergence of a second-order transition in the whole network is prevented here due to some of these nodes turning stubborn as a result of their red edges. Eventually, however, \u03bbb becomes large enough that even with occasional stubborn nodes present, a giant vulnerable cluster emerges. This point is reached much later in monoplex networks as compared to the multiplex networks. This is because in the former case stubborn nodes (with red edges) are equally likely to be connected with any other node, while in the latter case they are mostly connected with each other; thus, in the latter case they are less likely to inhibit the emergence of a giant vulnerable cluster on blue edges.",

We see that this final transition point is reached much later in multiplex networks than monoplex networks, meaning that cascades take place over a broader range of \u03bbb values in the former case. Again, this can be attributed to the high assortativity seen in multiplex networks that leads to extremely stubborn nodes (that have both blue and red edges) being isolated from those that are mildly stubborn (that have only blue edges). On the other hand, in monoplex networks, every node is able to connect with the extremely stubborn nodes, and thus the critical value of \u03bbb at which cascades become impossible due to high local stability is reached much earlier than that in multiplex networks.",

In particular, we now investigate the impact of \u03b1 on the number of phase transitions as well as transition points.

When \u03b1 is somewhere in-between (e.g., case \u03b1=0.166) it is possible to have the cascade intervals partially overlap.

The intermediate case of \u03b1=0.166 seems like a stretched version (over the x axis) of the case with \u03b1=0.99.
