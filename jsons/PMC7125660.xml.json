If admitted via the emergency department (ED), it is recommended that antibacterial therapy starts in the ED (Mandell et al., 2007). De-escalation or discontinuation is recommended when the results of microbiologic tests are available. However, the diagnostic yield from cultures of sputum and blood plus probing urine for the antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila is under 50% (Musher et al., 2013). Further, the results of traditional diagnostics (e.g., sputum culture) are not available for days. As a result, the often broad multidrug empiric antibiotic regimen is often prolonged.",
