A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer.

The three groups are represented in Table 1 . A Two-Way ANOVA (p < 0.001) indicates that the groups are statistically identifiable. The Table shows that category A consists of viruses that have greater respiratory transmission capabilities but lower fecaloral transmission potentials. Category B involves coronaviruses that have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials, whereas category C comprises of viruses with lower respiratory transmission. Furthermore, a higher inner shell disorder is often associated with the greater infectivity, especially with regard to respiratory transmission potential since disorder allows greater promiscuity of binding [6, 7] . Table 1 shows that SARS-CoV is grouped into category B along with other viruses that have intermediate respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials.

We believe that this is not the case. If SARS-CoV-2 would be placed in category C, the same category as MERS-CoV, then the model would be definitely wrong in terms of reproducibility. On the other hand, the placing of SARS-COV-2 in category A would be an inconsistency that would be difficult to explain. One would further notice that very few CoVs fall into category A, with the exception for HCoV-229E and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which make the chance of any CoVs including SARS-COV-2, to be in category A slim. More importantly, because SARS-CoV-2 is zoonotic and the only non-human CoV in category A is the avian IBV, placing SARS-COV-2 in category A could suggest that this virus is likely to be of avian origin, which is inconsistent with what we know about SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic study has confirmed that the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are bat CoVs [4, 36] . We also noticed that at least three of closest neighbors with similar N PIDs of 47-48% are those of bat origin (See Table 1 ). This suggests that bat CoVs are likely to have an optimal mix of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission potentials that reflect their N PID range of 47-48%, which provides for greater fitness for the spread of the viruses among bats and that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be of bat origin too given its N PID is 48%. There are highly debatable suggestions that snakes or pangolins [3, 37, 38] may be an intermediary host of the virus. Even if any of these is later deemed as true, our data imply that the virus had not the chance to evolved much with any intermediary host except bats, unlike the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which the model does suggest that they had evolved with hosts such as civet cats and camels respectively.

A qualitative inspection of the viruses in the three groups also reveals consistency.

This ability provides for rapid replication of the viral proteins and particles. This quick replication is also an efficient way to evade the host immune system by reproducing a large number of viral particles before the immune system even recognizes the virus, which then often goes on to overwhelm the body leading to the death of the host [6, [23] [24] [25] [26] . One highly plausible explanation for the link between rapid replication and the modes of transmission is that viral load in the body fluids of the infected host needs to be sufficiently high before the virus can be infectious via the respiratory mode. This therefore explains the fact that rapid viral replication and inner shell disorder were found to be the common link between virulence and respiratory transmission in the case of Nipah virus [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 175, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 176, "end": 180, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 181, "end": 185, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 186, "end": 190, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 191, "end": 195, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 544, "end": 548, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 549, "end": 553, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 554, "end": 558, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 559, "end": 563, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1016, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Greater viral loads in body fluids may be necessary for respiratory transmission: Roles of N disorder and protein binding promiscuity"}, {"text": "We don't, however, know if there is correlation between CoV virulence and inner shell disorder, even though the authors believe it exists, just like the other viruses.

Other factors include how many particles are released by the host and how long does the particle remain in the environment. We mentioned that our model has detected something odd about SARS-COV-2: this virus has one of the hardest outer shell within the family as seen in Fig. 1 and Table 1 (M PID = 6%). Since the outer shell plays the greater role in protecting the virion in comparison to the inner shell, the harder outer shell provides virus greater resilience to outside the body environment and to the presence of digestive enzymes found in the saliva, mucus, and other bodily fluids [20, 22, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . As a result, the virus with the harder outer shell is able to remain active for a longer time and, therefore a lesser number of viral particles is required for a chance to infect someone.

This is especially so in the case of TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus). TGEV could move rapidly among farm pigs to quickly devastate the farming community if not controlled early [5] [6] [7] . Our analysis reveals that TGEV is of category C (higher fecal-oral, lower respiratory transmission potentials) with M and N PIDs at 14% and 43% respectively.

An inspection of the M and N PIDs reveals the reason showing that PEDV belongs to the category B, along with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, unlike TGEV and MERS-CoV. This means that PEDV has a higher respiratory transmission potential than TGEV and that implies greater chances of fecal-respiratory transmission for the former.

Apparently, the result is implying that this is not necessarily true, as we have seen, and having higher fecaloral transmission potential can actually provide greater efficiency in the spread among farm animals, as we have seen in TGEV, such that the virus does not have to stay long outside the body.

This peculiarity is likely responsible for its high level of contagiousness, since hardness of its outer shell could provide the virus with the greater resilience to the conditions outside the body and in body fluid, as the harder shell will better protect the virion from damage as a result of the hostile environment and action of the digestive enzymes found in bodily fluids. As a result, it is likely that the infected body can shed more infectious particles that have a greater chance of infecting a person over its lifetime.
