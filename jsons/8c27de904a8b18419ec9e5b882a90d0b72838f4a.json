            "text": "COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has recently affected over 200,000 people and killed more than 8000. Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during COVID-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. Compared with healthy control, COVID-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage (ERS). In ERS patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14 ++ monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of CD14 ++ IL1B + monocytes. For nature killer (NK) cells and T cells, CD4 + T cells were significantly decreased and expressed high level of inflammatory markers, while NK cells were increased. In addition, T cells were highly expanded clone, especially in CD4+ T memory cells and CD8 + T cells. Among B cells, plasma cells were increased remarkably, and na\u00efve B cells were reduced. Our study also identified several novel B cell receptor (BCR) changes (such as IGHV1-8 and IGHV3-7), and confirmed isotypes (IGKV3-11 and IGHV3-21) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23+IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicated that IL-1\u03b2 and M-CSF may be novel candidate target gene for inflammatory storm, and TNFSF13, IL-18 and IL-4 may be benefit for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of inflammatory immune signature in early recovery stage, suggesting that the COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Our identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccine and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.",

As of 21 March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has affected over 300,000 people and killed more than 10,000 of those affected in >160 countries. Following its global spread, it has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO [4] . COVID- 19 show symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia. Some patients developed severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure [5] [6] [7] . Although scientists and clinicians globally made a great effort to produce vaccines and explore antiviral drugs [8, 9] , there remains no specific medicine and effective clinical treatment for COVID-19 [10, 11] .",

In LRS COVID patients, DC ligands were predicted to interact with B cell and T cell receptors involved in cell proliferation and the produce of antibodies. We discovered that the peripheral blood of LRS patients contain a diversity abundance of antibodies, and we found that IL18\u2212IL18RAP, TNFSF13-TNFRSF13B, TNFSF13-TNFRSF17, TNFSF13B\u2212TNFRSF17, TNFSF13B\u2212TNFRSF13B and TNFSF13B\u2212TNFRSF13C were highly expressed in our analysis of DC-B cell interaction (Fig.   7D ). Thus, we speculate that DC produce IL-18, TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B to promote the proliferation of B cell and then secret many antibodies into blood in ERS. From DC-T cell and T cell-B cell interaction, we discovered that DC not only produces IL-18 but also IL-7, to promote the proliferation of T cells, and T cells produce IL-2 to promote the proliferation of B cell and produce antibodies (Fig.   7D ).Thus, cell-to-cell interactions help us to understand why COVID-19 patients manifested high rates of monocytes and low rates of lymphocytes and the proportion of lymphocyte gradually increased in recovery patients in peripheral blood.",

In addition, we identify unique signatures of myeloid, NK, T and, B cells, and pinpoint the changes in epitopes of TCR and BCR.

Longitudinal studies of recovered patients on a larger cohort might help to understand the consequences of the disease. The novel BCRs identified in our study may advance our understanding of B cell mechanisms and have potential clinical utility in COVID-19",

Our scRNA-seq analysis showed that, compared with HCs, ERS patients have a lower ratio of T and NK cells, and these patients' T cells express higher levels of inflammatory genes, such as, JUN, FOS, JUNB, KLF6. In addition, high-throughput TCR sequencing identified expanded T cell clones in ERS patients. In LRS patients, the immunophenotype is different. In particular, LRS patients would have an increase in T and NK cells, and with a lower expression of inflammatory genes. We also performed a detailed analysis of B cells in patients and identified an increased population of plasma cells compared with HCs. We found that the BCR contain highly expanded clones, indicating their SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Importantly, we found several loci unique to COVID-19 infection. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23+IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity.
