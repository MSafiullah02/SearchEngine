A variety of respiratory viruses produce infections in humans with effects ranging from asymptomatic to life-treathening. Standard surveillance systems typically only target severe infections (ED outpatients, hospitalisations, deaths) and fail to track asymptomatic or mild infections. Here we performed a large-scale community study across multiple age groups to assess the pathogenicity of 18 respiratory viruses. We enrolled 214 individuals at multiple New York City locations and tested weekly for respiratory viral pathogens, irrespective of symptom status, from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined these test results with participant-provided daily records of cold and flu symptoms and used this information to characterise symptom severity by virus and age category. Asymptomatic infection rates exceeded 70% for most viruses, excepting influenza and human metapneumovirus, which produced significantly more severe outcomes. Symptoms were negatively associated with infection frequency, with children displaying the lowest score among age groups. Upper respiratory manifestations were most common for all viruses, whereas systemic effects were less typical. These findings indicate a high burden of asymptomatic respiratory virus infection exists in the general population.",

Additionally, community-based longitudinal studies have generally been restricted to young children or households and involve the sampling of specimens to identify viruses after an index symptomatic episode occurs [8] [9] [10] .",

Here, we document rates of asymptomatic respiratory virus infection through a large-scale community study across multiple age groups.

The study period spanned 2 years from October 2016 to April 2018 with some individuals enrolled for a single cold and flu season (October-April) and others for the entire period. All individuals from the selected facilities who were willing to participate were enrolled in the study. Enrolled individuals were asked to complete a baseline survey and provide two nasopharyngeal swab samples (one from each nostril). Following this preliminary step, two nasopharyngeal samples were again collected weekly from each participant irrespective of symptoms. The baseline questionnaire completed at the time of enrolment included information on ethnicity, general health, daily habits, travel history and household structure. For the entire duration of the study, participants provided a daily report rating nine respiratory illness-related symptoms (fever, chills, muscle pain, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, chest pain), which were recorded on a Likert scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Participants were also asked to note if they had sought medical attention, stayed home or taken influenza-like illness (ILI)-related medications as a consequence of their listed symptoms. Parents provided consent, baseline questionnaire answers and the daily survey information for their enrolled children. A total daily score was generated for each participant by summing the scores of the individual symptoms (total daily score ranges from 0 to 27).

Estimates of the asymptomatic ratio vary widely not only across diseases (from 95% of polio virus infections to <10% of measles), but also within the same disease due to different diagnostic testing procedures (PCR vs. serological tests [15] ) and sampling approaches (household vs. longitudinal studies).",

For influenza alone, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection has been estimated to be as low as 9.4% and as high as 90% depending on the virus type, study, season and definition of asymptomatic infection [15, 16] . There is also some evidence that viral shedding correlates with symptom severity and that the contagiousness of asymptomatic individuals is less than for symptomatic persons [17, 18] . The rationale is that respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing, runny nose) help spread pathogens through droplet transmission, either inhaled or settled [19] . However, the absence of symptoms might bring asymptomatic infected individuals into greater contact with susceptible persons outside the home. This is particularly true for infants and toddlers whose behaviour, hygiene habits and close physical contact typically favour the spread of germs, especially in childcare settings. Whether greater contact occurs and makes asymptomatic individuals effectively as contagious as symptomatic persons is not known. An additional difficulty is that a standard, accepted definition of symptomatic infection does not exist. Further, perception of symptoms is highly subjective, and it may be difficult to assess whether a symptom is caused by the pathogen. For example, chronic symptoms can occurrunny nose is a common sign in children that does not necessary imply viral infectionand allergies can cause sneezing. Fever, muscle pain and chills may also be caused by infections other than respiratory viruses. For these reasons, we adopted multiple definitions of 'symptomatic episodes', including personalised metrics.",

Influenza and HMPV infections caused significantly more symptoms than these other viruses; however, given its high prevalence, HRV was responsible for more than half of symptomatic episodes. In general, all viral infections presented with similar symptoms, with upper respiratory manifestations being more frequent, whereas systemic symptoms such as fever, muscle pain and chills were less typical. For surveillance in which ILI (defined as fever plus cough and/or sore throat) is used to record respiratory infections among people seeking care, this constraint may mean that many viral infections go undetected. Consistent with previous findings [20, 21] we did not find an association between viral co-infection and the likelihood of being symptomatic or presenting with more severe symptoms. Regardless of the definition, our findings underscore the extremely high proportion of respiratory viral infections that are asymptomatic. Further analysis is required to capture the role played by asymptomatic individuals in outbreak transmission dynamics, specifically the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic vs. symptomatic infections.",

            "text": "There was considerable heterogeneity in individual immune response: some individuals seemed to be consistently less predisposed to developing respiratory symptoms upon viral infection, whereas others were always symptomatic when testing positive. Infections in children were less symptomatic than in adults, even though children proved to be more frequently infected with respiratory viruses [11] . Frequent infections may enhance the ability of the immune system to identify and respond to pathogens; hence, the group subjected to the fewest respiratory viral infections (adults without children) reported the highest average symptom scores. However, the apparent lower pathogenicity among children may simply be an artefact introduced due to parents reporting symptoms for their children. Some symptoms, such as sore throat, muscle pain and chest pain, are difficult to identify in young children, and in fact they were less reported in this age category than among adults and teenagers. This possible bias in the reporting of symptoms is one limitation of our study. The daycare and workplace connections among some individuals in our cohort are another possible bias: some infections were likely caused by the same strain; thus the symptom profiles could be due to specific features of the pathogen rather than individual immune response. Further, all the children in our cohort were attending daycare or were siblings of children attending daycare. Interactions within the daycare setting could be a confounder in this analysis. Future studies should investigate the genetic basis of heterogeneity in host response to respiratory virus infection in order to identify the regulatory pathways controlling reactions to these infections. Moreover, longitudinal studies of this type, involving large networks of connected individuals, are needed to assess the role of asymptomatic infections in the transmission of respiratory viruses.",
