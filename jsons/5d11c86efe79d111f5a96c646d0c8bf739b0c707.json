Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently shown excellent performance in modeling Protein-Ligand Interaction (PLI). However, DNNs are only effective when physically sound descriptions of ligands and proteins are fed into the neural network for processing. Furthermore, previous research has not incorporated the secondary structure of proteins in a meaningful manner. In this work, we developed a DNN framework that utilizes the secondary structure information of proteins which is extracted as the curvature and torsion of the protein backbone to predict PLI. We demonstrate how our model outperforms previous machine and non-machine learning models on four major datasets: humans, C.elegans, DUD-E, and BindingDB. Visualization of the intermediate layers of our model shows a potential latent space for proteins which extracts important information about the bioactivity. We further investigate the inner workings of our model by visualizing the most important aspects in a protein that the model finds influential. We observed that our model learns important information about possible locations where a ligand would bind including binding sites, allosteric sites and cryptic sites, regardless of the conformation used. This work opens the door to the exploration of secondary structure based deep learning in general, which is not just confined to protein-ligand interactions.",

Computational methods can significantly boost time and save resources, however, due to the complex nature of PLI its prediction is a challenging computational enterprise. However, reliable PLI predictions could significantly reduce the discovery time for new treatments, eliminate toxic drug candidates and efficiently guide medicinal chemistry efforts 5 .

In this work, we propose a secondary structure based representation for proteins with a 1D vector contrary to 3D 19 or 2D 23 based representations. The 1D representation is based on the curvature and torsion of protein backbone and therefore does not necessarily require high resolution geometry information. Mathematically, curvature and torsion are sufficient to reasonably represent the 3D structure of a protein 24 and therefore contains compact information about it's function.",

In fact, a significant amount of information about the protein is embedded in the secondary structure elements such as helices, \u03b2 sheets, hairpins, coils, and turns etc. Therefore, it is imperative to incorporate the secondary structure of the protein when representing its features for machine learning approaches.

A protein can then be represented by considering the curvature and torsion at the anchor points (locations of CA) forming a 1D vector with twice the the number of amino acids. Figure 1b shows the decomposition of a protein found in Conus villepinii (PDB ID -6EFE) into scalar curvature \u03ba and torsion \u03c4 respectively. The residues 5 through 10 show a near ideal \u03b1 helix type secondary structure, which is represented as an oscillation of \u03c4 with smooth \u03ba. Similarly, the turn (residues 15 to 17) and a non-ideal \u03b1 helix (residues 20 to 25) are captured in the decomposition plot via unique patterns. Because the curvature and torsion information of the secondary structure of proteins are encoded as patterns, machine learning techniques may be powerful tools to predict PLI through efficiently learned representations of these patterns. More specifically, we hypothesized that, using convolution, varying sized filters may be excellent pattern matching methods for discerning structure from these decomposition plots. More analysis on protein representation is provided in the section SSnet. Figure 2 shows the SSnet model developed in this work. We provide here a general overview of the network and more details about its specific design operation is given in the later part of this section. As denoted in the left upper branch of Figure 2 after conversion into the Frenet-Serret frame and the calculation of curvature \u03ba and torsion \u03c4 , \u03ba and \u03c4 data (i.e decomposition data) is fed into the neural network. We denote this input as a 2D matrix (1D vector with curvature and torsion reshaped to contain curvature in one row and torsion in the other), X (0) , where each column represents a unique residue and the rows corresponding the curvature and torsion. The first layer is a branch convolution with varying window sizes. That is, each branch is a convolution with a filter of differing length. We perform this operation so that patterns of varying lengths in the decomposition plot can be recognized by the neural network. Each branch is then fed to more convolutions of same window size.",

The t-SNE Embedding (t-SNE) of GMP is shown as Figure 7 shows that the heatmap generates high value for residues near the binding site. c) shows a protein with four active sites and the model detects them all. The model also detects places where small molecules interact apart from the active site. d) shows a protein's allosteric site which inhibits toxicity from drugs binding at the active site. e), f) and g) shows cryptic sites with the protein-ligand complex shown in white. The heatmap is shown only for the apo protein which is aligned with the protein-ligand complex. Similarly, h) and i) are also cryptic sites, however, in the allosteric location attention relative to the others. However, the information that is learned from a neural attention layer could be misinterpreted since it adds an additional layer, increasing the complexity of the network. To tackle this problem we opted for Grad-CAM, due to its capability to provide a better insight for which points in the feature are important to predict a particular class based on convolution outputs. A convolution layer is used as it contains most of the spatial information which is lost in a fully connected dense layer. Figure 8a and 8b show the heatmaps generated by Grad-CAM on a homo sapiens protein classified as hormone/growth factor 65 Another example can be found in a Plasmodium falciparum protein shown in Figure 8d (PDB ID -5IFU, not in the training set of DUD-E dataset) in complex with glyburide. It is important to note that glyburide does not bind to the known primary binding site of the protein but in a distinct secondary binding site. The interaction between glyburide and this secondary binding site causes the inhibition of the protein, making this ligand an allosteric inhibitor. It has been shown that the presence of glyburide overcomes the toxicity related to drugs binding at the active site of this protein 68 , which is one of the characteristics of an allosteric inhibitor. The fact that SSnet model is able to highlight the portion of the protein where glyburide could bind, which is not the known orthosteric binding site but an allosteric one, represents one of the various applications that can be carried out with this model. These results also suggest that the SSnet model is learning the relevant information and generalizing the data learned to predict PLI for both unknown proteins and ligands.",

Retrieving such information is of critical importance as these sites are practically impossible to detect using classical virtual screening methods. Another example is provided by the protein Glutamate Racemase (GluR) shown in Figure 8f with PDB IDs 2OHV and 2OHG as bound and unbound pair, respectively. Similarly, Figure 8g shows the bound-unbound proteins for protease beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) with PDB IDs 3IXJ-1W50, respectively, where the unbound structure has a low score of binding as the loop comprising residues 71-74 is away from the active site.

SSnet provided a high probability score of more than 0.98 in both scenarios and highlighted high importance regions near the binding site.

SSnet requires a single conformation (apo protein or protein-ligand complex) to predict whether a ligand is active or not even if the protein-ligand complex has different secondary structure. However, to derive general rules, a more rigorous testing would be required. Another important issue that needs to be addressed is to distinguish between better and lesser binders. Our study suggests that end-to-end learning models based on the secondary structure of proteins have great potential in bioinformatics which is not just confined to protein ligand prediction and can be extended to various biological studies such as protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, protein-RNA interactions etc. We leave these explorations of the SSnet model for future work.",

We compared our model with Autodock Vina 62 and Smina 63 as non-machine learning methods and Atomnet 19 , 3D-CNN 64 and GNN-CNN 20 as machine learning models. Autodock Vina is an open-source program which is based on the classical force fields to predict docking in PLI. Smina is an advanced version of Autodock Vina that adds more control of scoring function and minimization. Atomnet is a machine learning model that considers vectorized versions of 1 \u00c5 3D grids as input vectors for a protein-ligand complex (Note: Atomnet requires 3D information of protein-ligand complexes). A DNN framework is built based on 3D convolutional layers to predict binary PLI. Similar to GNN-CNN, 3D-CNN also takes fixed size 3D grid (24 \u00c5) from the centre of the binding site (requires protein-ligand complex) as input whichis converted to density distribution around the centre of each atom. The density distribution is composed of piecewise combination of a Gaussian and a quadratic function. These information is then fed to convolutional neural networks to predict PLI. All the mentioned 3D models are based on all atoms in the protein ligand complex. Although a satisfactory information is provided to the model, the large number of input features create noise which makes binary prediction of PLI a challenge. With limited amount of information, SSnet was able to outperform all these models in terms of AUC with an AUC score of 0.984. These results suggest that the curvature and torsion information accumulates compact information for PLI prediction tasks.

In this way, similar data points forms a cluster and are distinguishable with other data points. We tested the proteins in the test set of DUD-E dataset (# of unique proteins = 30) and consider all their interaction with the ligands. The results of t-SNE clearly distinguishes all the proteins (# of clusters = 30). It is important to note that our model had no prior information about the proteins as they were not in the training set. The fact that t-SNE clearly distinguishes all the protein suggests that the information gathered by the convolution layers are not general (such as \u03b1 helix or \u03b2 sheet type patterns). More specifically, our model gathers necessary information required for PLI prediction. Based on these results we conclude that our model is able to create a latent space which encodes important information about the bioactivity of the protein. Since the model was trained to predict activity of a protein based on several ligands, such latent space will encode important information about its binding site (including allosteric site) and therefore can be a potential scoring function to compare proteins based on their activity. With the development of latent space we opened a door for future exploration in this direction. Visualization of heatmap using Grad-CAM ML/DL are black box models and therefore it is imperative to investigate what features the model learned. In most of the previous studies 20 , a neural attention layer is added to the network to understand the important points in the feature space that get higher Grad-CAM visualization of the heatmap for nine different proteins.

Grad-CAM clearly highlights the important residues for ligand recognition. In both cases the ligand forms several non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Walls interaction etc. with the side chains of the highlighted part in the protein. On a closer look, we observed that the SSnet model in general highlights a weighted probability density of the binding sites present in a protein (heatmaps generated via Grad-CAM for 10 different proteins is shown in section 3 of the supporting information). We further evaluated the protein found in meleagris gallopavo classified as receptor 67 (PDB ID -2VT4, taken from test set of DUD-E dataset) as shown in Figure 8c.

This might be one of the reasons for a lower performance of GNN in terms of AUC when compared to ECF and Avalon. CLP gives a descent AUC score of 0.966, however, it is the lowest performing model. CLP is based on autoencoder which is trained to take an input SMILES string, converts it to a lower dimension, and reproduces the SMILES string back. In this way CLP is able to generate a lower dimensional vector for a given SMILES string. However, relevant information required for the prediction of PLI might have lost from the ligands which explains its lower performance. ECF and Avalon have almost similar AUC score as they both directly provide the information of the atoms and functional groups a ligand contains. For further comparison on human and C.elegans datasets we considered Avalon as ligand descriptor.",
