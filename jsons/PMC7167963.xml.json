In contrast, two other types of HIV\u2010associated neuropathies, inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDPN) (in both acute (AIDPN) and chronic (CIDPN) forms), and vasculitic neuropathy have clinical and pathological features that suggest an autoimmune pathogenesis. Both occur during phases of HIV infection in which T lymphocytes are not significantly depleted so that sensitization of T cells to peripheral nerve antigens can occur. Circulating antibodies of IgG and IgM isotypes against myelin have been found in the serum of HIV\u2010seropositive individuals with IDPN and vasculitic neuropathy, and symptomatic improvement after plasmapheresis has been recorded in both groups.\n14\n To date only a small number of individuals with HIV infection and symptoms of neuropathy has been studied. There are no data regarding the prevalence of antibodies against peripheral myelin and axonal epitopes in HIV\u2010infected individuals without overt neuropathic symptoms. Antiprotein and antiglycolipid reactivity, however, has been demonstrated in various neuropathic syndromes (especially Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)) in individuals without HIV infection. Such data may assist in reaching a consensus on the significance of antimyelin antibodies in the pathogenesis of HIV\u2010associated neuropathy.",

More importantly, these T cells recognize glycolipids by a non\u2010MHC\u2010type mechanism, involving the CD1b molecule which can present glycolipid to the T\u2010cell receptor.\n54\n Of major significance were the recent findings of Khalili\u2010Shirazi et al., who demonstrated strong labeling of CD1b on endoneurial macrophages and on myelinated nerve fibers in AIDPN biopsied nerves but could not see such patterns in other diseased (various peripheral neuropathies) and normal nerves, suggesting a strong association between the upregulation of CD1 and inflammatory neuropathy.\n55\n Further evidence for this association were the recent results presented by Shamshiev et al. who showed that circulating T cells isolated from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with either active or stable demyelinating lesions were reactive against various glycolipids with different clones showing intense reactivity with gangliosides, GalC and GalS.\n56\n Importantly, one specific CD1b\u2010restricted T\u2010cell clone, reacting against the monosialoganglioside GM1, was shown to be specifically recognized by the TCR and is able to discriminate between small variations in the carbohydrate moieties. These investigators went further to show that the glycolipid reactive T cells more often show a T helper (Th)1\u2010like functional phenotype because they release the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3.

It may also assist in the diagnosis of HIV\u2010infected patients with underlying subclinical neuropathy. Such patients may benefit by the early institution of treatment such as plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin. A serological screening test may also be of benefit in monitoring disease progress by measuring antiglycolipid antibody titers. It may also be possible to differentiate the neuropathic syndrome according to the specific glycolipid against which antibodies are directed. An example of this is sensorimotor dysfunction with raised anti\u2010GalS antibody titers.",

There exist a set of working criteria which have been derived from a variety of diseases that are generally believed to have antibody\u2010mediated autoimmune mechanisms.\n170\n These include: (i) antibody is present in patients with the disease; (ii) antibody interacts with the target antigen; (iii) passive transfer of the antibody produces the disease; (iv) immunization of animals with the antigen produces disease; and (v) reduction of the antibody ameliorates the disease. All of the aforementioned criteria have been described in assessing the role of anti\u2010GalS antibodies in peripheral neuropathy. Only criteria 1 and 2 were described by De Gasperi et al.,\n80\n Petratos et al.\n\n82\n, \n83\n, \n84\n and Gisslen et al.\n\n81\n in HIV\u2010infected patients. Passive transfer of these antibodies in HIV\u2010infected patients into animals would address criterion 3 and has been described in HIV\u2010negative patients with immune demyelination.\n79\n Criterion 4 has already been clearly defined in animals\n88\n and criterion 5 could be trialed in HIV\u2010infected patients once a clear pathogenetic link of these autoantibodies has been established. For the time being, further research is essential to develop a direct immunopathogenic link for these antiglycolipid antibodies in HIV\u2010associated peripheral neuropathy. Only then will these diagnostic and therapeutic regimens be implemented within the neurological clinic.",
