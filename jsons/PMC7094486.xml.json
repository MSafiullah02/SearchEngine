A sterile stock solution of 1 g/10 mL of magnesium sulfate or an identical volume of 0.9% saline placebo was used to prepare a fresh blinded syringe of 25 mg/mL and given at 4 mL/kg intravenously by using a syringe pump over 60 min; this design was according to a randomization table provided to the unblinded pharmacist, who withheld treatment assignment from all others.

The mean bronchiolitis severity scores for the groups were plotted against different time intervals. Our previous study analysis11 regarding duration of infirmary stay for patients with bronchiolitis found a geometric mean length of stay of 27 h, and we selected that duration to estimate sample size, judging a reduction to 18 h (as seen in that study with dexamethasone) would be clinically significant. With a sample size of 76 per group, there would be 80% power to find a significant difference (P = .05, two-sided). To compensate for dropouts, we planned to recruit 200 patients but after three bronchiolitis seasons, noticing minimal dropout, we closed the study at 162 patients.",

In a second small trial that enrolled patients with moderate bronchiolitis and compared nebulized magnesium, nebulized salbutamol, and nebulized magnesium sulfate/salbutamol combined, the only significant difference was the Wang severity score at 4 h, which favored the combined aerosol group compared with the nebulized magnesium alone group (P < .05).22 Given the uncertainties about clear-cut efficacy for\u2014as well as the amount of magnesium delivered by\u2014nebulizing magnesium for the treatment of asthma,23 we chose to use IV magnesium for the present study.",
