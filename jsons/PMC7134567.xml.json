            "text": "Influenza A virus is subtyped on the basis of two surface proteins, haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), which govern the viral lifecycle at cellular entry and release of virions. All subtypes of influenza A virus, from H1 to H16 and N1 to N9, are detected in wild water birds; H17N10 is found in bats.1 Although most infections with these subtypes are mild or asymptomatic in avian species, outbreaks in wild birds and poultry have been associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5, and outbreaks in poultry have been associated with H7 subtypes.1, 2 Human infections are generally confined to H1, H2, and H3 subtypes, because these subtypes have affinity for host cell receptors containing \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid (which occur in human beings), whereas other avian influenza viruses generally preferentially attach to avian host cell receptors, which contain \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid. Direct transmission of avian influenza viruses from domestic poultry to people have been documented only for the H5N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N2, and H10N7 subtypes.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Human infections due to these subtypes were generally mild and manifested as conjunctivitis and upper-respiratory-tract infections, except for the H5N1 subtype, which was associated with mortality of greater than 50%, and the H7N7 subtype, which has caused one death.1, 4 Since February, 2013, a novel reassortant H7N9 virus associated with human deaths but no apparent outbreaks in poultry and wild birds has emerged in eastern China. We report on four patients with severe infection due to this H7N9 virus. We sequenced, characterised, and compared viral genomes from a patient and an epidemiologically linked wet market chicken isolate.",

This study was approved by the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (reference number 2013-131). We entered history; physical examination; and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigation results into a predesigned database. We recorded patients' acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores8 and defined acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome on the basis of standard criteria.9, 10 Presumed incubation period was defined as the time between last poultry exposure and onset of symptoms.",

The detection limit of the M, H7 and N9 RT-PCR assays was about 100 copies of RNA per mL. All samples were cultured with trypsin in the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line for 7 days. We did immunofluorescent antigen staining for influenza A nucleoprotein (D3 ultra 8 DFA, respiratory virus screening and identification kit, Diagnostic Hybrid, OH, USA) under ultraviolet microscopy (Eurostar III plus, Euroimmune AG, Lubeck, Germany) in cell cultures with positive cytopathic changes. RT-PCR was used to subtype for H1, H3, H5, H9, and H7.",

These findings suggest sporadic poultry-to-person transmission.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed on April 11, 2013, with the terms \u201cinfluenza\u201d, \u201cavian\u201d, \u201cH5\u201d, \u201cH5N1\u201d, \u201cH7\u201d, \u201cH9\u201d, and \u201cH10\u201d for articles published in English. Our search did not reveal any reports of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection in human beings before 2013. We noted only reports of poultry outbreaks caused by some H7N9 virus strains, which were usually weakly pathogenic for avian species. All reported human infections with avian influenza A virus were caused by H5N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N2, and H10N7 subtypes. Severe community-acquired pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction due to H5N1 infection was associated with a mortality rate of more than 50%, and one death due to the H7N7 subtype has been reported.4 However, most H7 viruses and other subtypes caused mild respiratory illness or conjunctivitis in people. Most cases were attributed to avian-to-person transmission, and there was little evidence of first generation person-to-person transmission.\nInterpretation\nOur study showed that human infections with the avian influenza A H7N9 virus were acquired from live poultry markets in China (evidenced by the phylogenetic relatedness between viruses in isolates from a patient and an epidemiologically linked chicken). Markers of mammalian adaptation were found in the human virus isolate. Clinical manifestation of this new emerging infection is similar to that of H5N1 infection and can be fatal in patients with substantial cytokine activation and multiorgan dysfunction. Further virological study is important to establish diagnosis and allow early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and infection control. Rising poultry and human populations will increase the emergence of novel avian influenza viruses infecting human beings.",

Previous surveillance studies have shown the H7N3 virus to be present in domestic ducks in Zhejiang.30 Avian H7 subtype viruses are likely to have become established in domestic poultry in Zhejiang. Interaction between newly established H7 subtypes and other avian influenza viruses, such as the H9N2 subtype, might have resulted in the current H7N9 strain, which has gained some ability to infect human beings. Further adaptation could lead to less symptomatic infection and more efficient person-to-person transmission. Aggressive intervention to block further animal-to-person transmission in live poultry markets, as has previously been done in Hong Kong, should be considered. Temporary closure of live bird markets and comprehensive programmes of surveillance, culling, improved biosecurity, segregation of different poultry species, and possibly vaccination programmes to control H7N9 virus infection in poultry seem necessary to halt evolution of the virus into a pandemic agent.",
