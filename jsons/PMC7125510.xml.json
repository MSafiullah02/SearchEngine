            "text": "Polymorphism is an important solid-state property for consideration in the formulation development and large-scale production of solid dosage forms in the pharmaceutical industry. Since different crystalline polymorphs exhibit different physicochemical properties (e.g. melting point, density, hardness, stability and dissolution rate) and possibly bioavailability, stringent regulatory requirements have been imposed on the identification and specification of polymorphs for particular drug materials as part of the quality assurance process. For stability reason, the form that is stable under ambient conditions is normally employed in drug formulation. Contamination of a drug material with its alternative metastable polymorphic form, which can occur during crystallization, grinding/milling or any other form of mechanical treatment, is of particular concern, since such polymorphic impurity could adversely compromise both the stability and the performance of the final products. In order to limit such undesirable physical impurity in pharmaceutical materials, accurate quantification of trace levels of such impurities existing as separate crystalline phases has become an important issue. However, the most widely used methods for solid-phase characterization such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, are normally not sufficiently sensitive for detecting relatively low levels (<5%) of polymorphic impurity.",

            "text": "In our previous study, a thermoanalytical approach using a standard DSC instrument has been successfully applied to quantify trace levels of polymorphic form II impurity in form I samples of salmeterol xinafoate (SX) (Tong et al., 2003). Essentially, the approach involved measurement of the recrystallization rate of form II from form I melt in DSC at varying scanning speeds, and analysis of the data (expressed as \u03b1\u2013time curves) by non-linear iterative fitting to the Avrami-Erofe\u2019ev (AE) equation for the tested SX samples and reference materials of forms I and II mixed in various defined ratios. A mathematical equation based on an instantaneous nucleation model was derived specifically to relate the AE rate constants determined using the physical mixtures of reference SX materials to the corresponding crystal phase compositions (i.e. for construction of a calibration curve). This equation was then used to calculate the concentration of polymorphic form II impurity in each tested form I sample from the computed AE rate constant. It should be noted that the principle of this technique is based not on a direct measurement of the enthalpy of fusion for estimating the actual amount of form II present (as in a standard DSC approach), but rather on how fast this high-melting polymorph is being generated from the form I melt. It has been demonstrated that quantification of as low as 0.1% (w/w) of form II is feasible. It has also been suggested that such a technique could potentially be applied to other enantiotropic polymorphic pairs. In order to verify the general applicability of the developed approach in other enantiotropic polymorph systems and to refine the approach for adaptation to other variants of crystallization kinetics, we have extended the above work to ribavirin, an antiviral drug displaying roughly similar polymorph-dependent crystallization kinetics in melts to that of salmeterol xinafoate.",

After confirming the identity of the polymorphs by DSC, PXRD and FTIR spectroscopy, the recrystallized (reference) and pharmaceutical grade ribavirin samples were subjected to thermal analysis as reported for salmeterol xinafoate. In order to generate appropriate levels (i.e. below 5%, w/w) of form I metastable phase in pharmaceutical grade ribavirin for trial determination by the established approach, the material was triturated manually or ground using a self-fabricated ball mill system for various time periods. It should be noted that while such grinding treatments might also produce amorphous materials, DSC analysis of the ground ribavirin samples did not reveal any recrystallization exotherm before the melting of form II even at the slowest scanning rate (2 K min\u22121) and PXRD showed negligible changes in diffraction pattern (data not shown), suggesting that amorphous ribavirin is either absent or present in trace (non-detectable) quantities. Such low levels of amorphous microdomains in the samples are unlikely to have any significant bearing on the polymorphic impurity determination, as the approach measures the impurity in terms of the recrystallization rate of form I from form II melt, which is strictly dependent on the amount of form I nuclei present (see Section 3.2).",

Comparison of the fusion thermodynamic properties between R-I (form I) and R-II (form II) showed that form I has a lower enthalpy of fusion (\u0394H\nf) than form II (144.5 J g\u22121 versus 170.7 J g\u22121) but a higher melting point than form II (174.7 \u00b0C versus 166.2 \u00b0C), consistent with enantiotropic polymorphism (Burger and Ramberger, 1979a, Burger and Ramberger, 1979b). The DSC profiles of individual R-I and R-II samples are devoid of the melting endotherms of the alternative polymorphic forms, reflecting a very high level of polymorphic purity for these recrystallized samples (Fig. 2).",

As suggested by the differences/similarities in FTIR spectra and PXRD patterns among the samples, R-II and R-I are distinctly different polymorphs while R-RW and R-II are of essentially the same form. Careful examination of the wave-numbers of selected bands in the spectra revealed significant differences in intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding network between R-II and R-I (Table 1\n), consistent with the structural differences expected of the two polymorphs. Comparison of the observed PXRD patterns with simulated crystal structure data (Allen, 2002, Bruno et al., 2002) also confirmed R-II and R-I to be the stable form II and metastable form I, respectively, as reported in literature (Prusiner and Sundaralingam, 1973). Interestingly, the reported crystal density of form II (1.584 g cm\u22123) is lower than that of form I (1.654 g cm\u22123) (Prusiner and Sundaralingam, 1973), which appears to violate the density rule (Burger and Ramberger, 1979a). Nonetheless, there are a few pharmaceutical examples where the density rule does not hold, such as chloroprocaine (Schmidt and Griesser, 2003), hydroquinone (Naoki et al., 1999), neotame (Dong et al., 2002) and resorcinol (Yoshino et al., 1999).",

Previous studies employing the AE model for polymorphic purity determination of salmeterol xinafoate showed that the exponent, n, can assume a value of 2, corresponding to the observed two-dimensional platelet morphology of the crystals (Tong et al., 2003). Similarly, for ribavirin that recrystallizes as platelets from melt, the data fitting could also be performed with the n value fixed at 2, as shown in Table 2, Table 3\n. Good fit (as revealed by a high R\n2) was observed for all the data except for the samples containing higher concentrations of the metastable form produced by the ball milling technique. The reason for the poor fit of data with the latter samples remains obscure, but may be due to a change in nucleation mechanism with milling time. As with salmeterol xinafoate, the recrystallization of ribavirin from melt could be assumed to follow the instantaneous nucleation model (Kashchiev, 2000), leading to the following derived equation (Tong et al., 2003):(3)K=C1(1\u2212x)+C2xwhere x is the weight fraction of metastable nuclei in the material matrix, and C\n1 and C\n2 are the constants related to the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation in melt, respectively, C\n2 being typically much larger than C\n1 (i.e. heterogeneous nucleation dominates). It has been shown that in the case of salmeterol xinafoate, Equation (3) holds with an R\n2 of 0.967 (Tong et al., 2003). However, for ribavirin, the relationship is apparently not a linear function according to Equation (3) (Fig. 7\n). This highlights the complexity and potential limitations in making prior assumptions on the recrystallization kinetics of different melts analyzed by DSC. The apparent non-linearity would imply a change in two-dimensional crystallization kinetics for R-II samples mixed with increasing proportion of R-I crystals. The fundamental reasons for such variation are outside the scope of this work. To account for the observed non-linearity/kinetic changes, Equation (3) can be empirically modified by inclusion of an exponent, a, as follows:(4)K=[C1(1\u2212x)+C2x]1/a\n",

The modification involved the incorporation of an empirical exponent into the derived calibration equation (Equation (4)) to account for the observed composition-dependent changes in crystallization kinetics of the reference polymorph mixtures. Such modification has made possible the determination of as low as 0.004% (w/w) metastable polymorph in ribavirin form II samples induced by different forms of grinding treatment. Being relatively insensitive to the prior assumptions made on the crystallization kinetics of the materials studied, the modified approach may find wide application in the quality control of enantiotropically related drug polymorphs.",
