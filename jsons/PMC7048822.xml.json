As for plasma medicine, interest has grown in recent years on the application of plasma to agriculture, with an increasing number of uses for the treatment of crops, seeds, water and soil, and at multiple steps in the food industry. On seeds, LTP treatment reduces microbial contamination and promotes germination, rooting and growth of seedlings45\u201353. It has enhanced safety while maintaining quality properties of a wide range of perishable food products in a fast processing time54. LTP is a promising tool for the inactivation of microbial contaminants55, including foodborne pathogens56, and preservation of perishable food products. It has a great potential for industrial applications due to its non-thermal operation, short processing time, energy efficiency, and antimicrobial efficacy with minimal impact on food quality and the environment57,58.",

In the Vis-NIR range, we observed characteristic sequences of bands of the first positive system (FPS) (B3\u03a0g \u2192 A3\u03a3u+) of N2. Atomic oxygen emission line was clearly observable at 777 nm, indicating the production of atomic oxygen during the plasma on phase. Partially-resolved structures of SPS displayed in Fig. 3 were analysed by means of synthetic models detailed in61. The SPS(0,0) band can be fitted for a given instrumental function by fixing the rotational temperature of 400 \u00b1 25 K. We should notice that this temperature is related to the discharge on time in the surface discharge. SDBD plasma is localized just a few microns above the dielectric surface and this cannot be considered the temperature of the gas in contact with the treated substrate. Moreover, considering that the gas is flowing at 7 slm, the residence time in the discharge volume is 64 ms, therefore we can exclude a heat accumulation inside the gap. In Fig. 3 experimental SPS(0,0) band profile is shown together with two synthetic profiles (simulated for rotational temperatures of 300 and 500 K) in logarithmic scale in order to demonstrate sensitivity of the tail of the band (formed by the overlap of R1, R2 and R3 branches) with respect to the rotational temperature of the C3\u03a0u state.",

The evolution of damages on conidia surface spanned from cracks to complete removal of the outer layer of the cell wall, shrinkage, and a deeper ablation from the surface of conidia. In the case of B. cinerea, the early effect on the surface mostly consisted of partial ablation of the outer layers of cell wall without any crack while damages appeared irreversible after 3 min of exposure, and after 5 min most conidia were completely destroyed. In the case of M. fructicola, the effect was even stronger with cracks appearing after 1 min, and damages of conidia were more evident following longer treatment times.

In the case of A. carbonarius, the surface ornamentation of conidia was primarily affected by plasma treatment just after 1 min, and more evident after 3 min of treatment when spore walls were smoothed out by plasma ablation and cell wall integrity was obviously compromised in agreement with the results of the conidia germination assay.

The antimicrobial activity can be achieved either by UV irradiation leading to the erosion of microorganisms through photon-induced desorption that results from UV photons breaking chemical bonds in cell molecules with the formation of volatile compounds or by etching due to highly energetic ions and reactive species through bombarding and reacting with the surface of the treated materials65. Once the outer layers of the cell are damaged and then cellular integrity compromised, the UV photons can directly hit genetic material leading to DNA damage with the highest killing rate66. Direct DNA damage by direct UV irradiation of microbial cells or spores cannot lead to sterilization due to the minimal depth of penetration of UV photons into cells stacked or covered with various debris. In atmospheric pressure air plasmas, reactive species such as O, OH, and NO2 are believed to play the most crucial role in decontamination from microorganisms. Heat and UV radiation may play secondary roles, and we expect their effects to be either minimal or indirect.",

We can assume that UV photons in the plasma generated at atmospheric pressure should be not enough to have a significant influence on direct inactivation of the fungi because of the protective action of melanin and similar compound embedded in the cell wall. Differences in efficacy of surface etching are more likely related to the cell wall structure and thickness affecting mechanical and chemical strength, as well as to the stacking of spores on their surfaces and the number of cells per spore. Multicellular spores may still have the possibility to germinate if not all the cells in the spore are killed by the treatment.

In the most resistant A. alternata, we observed conidia shrinkage, surface changes and cell envelope invaginations. Lysis followed by leakage of cellular content was the main destructive process observed. This is consistent with the decrease in viability of conidia and the increase in their membrane permeability showed by the fluorescence-based assays indicating leakage of cell content and subsequent cell death. Therefore, SEM analysis demonstrated modifications of the external shape of conidia, which could be attributed to the decomposition of organic components by etching and photo-desorption associated with chemical bond breakage, and consequent formation of volatile compounds65.",

The activated chemical species produced by LTP may contribute to both the suggested modes of action by acting rapidly against contaminant microorganisms and as a defense inducer in plants. ROS and RNS have a significant impact on plant cells causing many physiological, biochemical, molecular, and hormonal changes89. Treatments with plasma-activated water induce plant growth as well as endogenous production of ROS and RON, defense hormone metabolism, and up regulation of pathogenesis-related genes in tomato seedlings90, thus enhancing resistance against bacterial leaf spot91. Our results suggest modifications in fruit tissues which can suggest metabolic changes affecting infection establishment. A slight colorimetric change was observed on treated fruits suggesting an increase of contents in polyphenolic compounds after plasma treatment (data not shown). Moreover, the activation of defense responses was indicated by the significant reduction of disease incidence recorded up to 8 DAI on fruits treated before pathogen inoculation.",

The quite complex structure and consistence of some fruit tissues, like those of strawberry or blueberry, could hinder full exposure of microorganism cells to plasma effects and create physical barriers that significantly reduces the efficacy of LTP inactivation sometimes causing lesions on the fruit surface that may function as primary infection sites for wound pathogens. On the contrary, smooth and impervious surfaces such as those of cherry fruits or grape, blueberry or currant berries could facilitate deactivation of contaminant spores56,92. The configuration and discharge parameters used in our experiments, even if not completely optimized, allowed to extend the shelf life of cherry fruits of two different cultivars artificially inoculated with two major pathogens (B. cinerea and M. fructicola) affecting fruit quality during postharvest, processing, and storage. These results are comparable to those reported for biocontrol agents or resistance inducers used for the control of postharvest decay of fresh products93. They show a promise for practical application of novel nonthermal plasma technology for the treatment of fresh produce that would allow longer shelf life, less spoilage, and safer products.",

We demonstrated that remote plasma treatment by SDBD is effective against conidia of fungi responsible for major economic losses in the agriculture industry, reducing to undetectable levels their viability/germinability on the surface of artificial media. Cell wall disruption and leakage of cell contents were caused by plasma treatments. This demonstrates that treatment can act directly on fungal spores, likely due to the combined effect of active chemical species (i.e., ROS and RNS) and UV lights.",
