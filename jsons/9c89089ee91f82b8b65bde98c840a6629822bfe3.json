            "text": "Until recently, the replication and pathogenesis of HBoV1 was not known, since no in vitro or animal models were available. However, in 2009 the HBoV1 was successfully cultured in primary airway epithelial cells differentiated into pseudo-stratified human airway epithelium. 47 It has been demonstrated that the transcription profile of HBoV1 displays features similar to bovine parvovirus 1 (BPV1) and minute virus of canines (MVC), which also belong to genus Bocavirus. 47 In 2012 the establishment of a reverse genetic system for studying HBoV1 in human airway epithelia (HAE) has enabled better understanding of HBoV1 replication and pathogenesis. 10 The full-length genome of HBoV1 was sequenced for the first time, and cloned into a plasmid. It was demonstrated that the infectious clone was capable of replicating and producing progeny virions in the absence of a helper virus in polarized differentiated human embrionic kidney cells (HEK 293). The infectious virions are able to infect polarized differentiated human airway epithelia from both apical and basolateral surfaces. 10, 48, 49 HBoV1 infection disrupts the integrity of HAE by disruption of the tight barrier junction and leads to loss of cilia and airway epithelial cell hypertrophy. The permissiveness of the HBoV1 infection is dependent on various steps including virus attachment, entry, intracellular trafficking, and DNA replication, and all of these steps need to be investigated. 10 It has been shown that infection caused by MVC, which is most closely related to HBoV1, triggers the intra-S-phase arrest to slow down the host cellular DNA replication and, by activation of host DNA damage response, recruit the cellular DNA replication system for viral DNA replication. 50 It was demonstrated that HBoV1 NP1 induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in Hela cells, suggesting that amino acids at the N-terminal domain of NP1 protein may be critical for the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in mammalian cells. The apoptotic cell death is mediated by mitochondrion pathway independent of viral genome replication or viral protein expression. 49 In general, parvoviruses replicate their genomes via a \"rolling hairpin\" mechanism, a variant of a \"rolling circle\" replication. 11 Whether the HBoV replicates by the rolling circle or alternative rolling hairpin mechanism still needs to be answered. 11 In HBoV1, head to tail concatemeric intermediates were identified instead of head to head or tail to tail, by PCR and sequencing, suggesting that HBoV1 is replicating via a \"rolling circle\" mechanism. 51 Whether the persistence of HBoV1 up to several months is due to persistent replication and shedding, passive persistence after primary infection or recurrent mucosal contamination, remains unknown. 3 However, the HBoV1 persistence can be explained by the long-lasting apical and basolateral shedding of the virus, as it has been shown on in vitro HAE cultures. It is also possible that the HBoV1 genome can be presented as an episome with prolonged gene expression and replication. 10, 51, 52 Only recently has it been demonstrated that HBoV1 productively infects two commercially available cell cultures, MucilAirway HAE (MatTek Co., Ashland, MA, USA) and EpiAirway HAE (Epithelix SaRL, Geneva, Switzerland). The HBoV1 infection resulted in destruction of the epithelial tight junction, loss of cillia and enlargement of the nucleus in the infected cells, HBoV1 persistence, indicating that those two in vitro cell culture systems are suitable for further HBoV1 replication and pathogenesis investigation. 53 Although HBoV1 is respiratory virus, its DNA can be found in blood of patients with severe acute respiratory infection. After infection, the IgG and IgM against HBoV1 VP2 protein can be detected in serum, showing that HBoV1 causes systemic infections. It has been shown that HBoV1 VP2 virus-like particles (VLPs) can elicit typical virus-induced immune response involving Th1 and Th2 cell cytokines. 54, 55 In immunocompromised individuals HBoV1 dissemination can occur and the HBoV1 DNA could be detected in respiratory secretions, blood, feces, and urine. 42,56",

Although some respiratory viruses are more strongly associated with specific signs and symptoms, there is usually an overlap in the clinical presentation and it is therefore not possible to distinguish between viral pathogens. 66 When the etiology of respiratory disease needs to be resolved, the differential diagnosis list should include all well-known respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, influenza virus A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1\u00c04, enteroviruses, and human coronaviruses. 66 ",
