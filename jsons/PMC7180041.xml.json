Eventually, it started to spread in various regions throughout China and on 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (WHO, 2020a) which later became a global pandemic. As of 7 April 2020, the WHO Situation report-78 indicates more than 1.2 million confirmed cases and deaths greater than 72,000 globally (WHO, 2020b). The infection is spreading day by day and the healthcare system struggles to take care of every infected individual especially in excessively infected countries such as USA, Italy, Spain and the list goes on. Though the characteristics of this novel coronavirus are not well known, we can infer its behavior from the statistics such as rapid rate of spread, vulnerability is higher for low immune, diabetic and aged people, widely different pattern of recovery rate and other information we have is that it spreads by a human to human transmission through droplets or by direct contact and the incubation period for the infection has been estimated as 2\u201314 days (Lai et al., 2020).",

Governments are doing their best to mitigate the infection and also to meet the requirements for the healthcare system. Moreover, unfortunately, there is neither a medicine for the cure nor a vaccine for prevention of this novel coronavirus as of 10 April 2020. But countries have been trying various treatment methods and usage of different suitable medicines (without proper confirmation). The preventive measures defined by the WHO is to wash the hands frequently with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand rub, following social distancing, and practicing respiratory hygiene (WHO, 2020c). Masks will also play a role in safeguarding people from infection and it is mandatory to know when and how to use the mask. Apart from it, the only way to stop the infection from spreading is by staying at home and avoiding social gathering, following social distancing and isolating us from infected people or people subjected to quarantine. Hence, to stop the spread, it requires a combined effort from all social bodies such as the healthcare system, government and more importantly from the public. And they can be controlled only to a limited extent. Besides, the extensive utilization of potential technologies together with effective healthcare treatment and strong governance will be astonishing that would strengthen the defense line to fight against COVID-19.",

The next section deals with the technological strategies that are implemented to control the pandemic which includes Information communication, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and supply chain strategies. And the subsequent section gives an insight of indirectly impacting technological strategies whose purpose is to support the confinement of the society during pandemic crisis. This section comprises the sub-domains such as work from home, distance learning, and surveillance. These two sections altogether cover the directly and indirectly influencing technologies in controlling the pandemic and are also backed up with few practical illustrations. Then, the prospective technologies that are less used but have immense potential in supporting the society during epidemic difficulties is also discussed. Then, the subsequent section gives some essential guidelines to follow during this pandemic period as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and at last, a critical discussion of the influence created by these technologies, the existing challenges and predicted future impacts accompanied by the conclusion is presented.",

We sought guidance from medical and technical professionals as a result of which the topics need to be covered in this study is figured out. In order to write the manuscript in this novel theme, one need to know what is happening around and requires tedious surveying of online information from verified sources together with literature survey for supporting the feasibility of the approach disclosed in the online sources. The literature survey is primarily done by using platforms such as Google scholar, Elsevier, PubMed and IEEE. Firstly, the initial screening is done by analyzing the title of the work and then according to the sections in our study, the identified work is sorted. The scrutinizing stage 1 is performed by scanning the abstract of the work sorted and decision of scrutinization of each work is carried out jointly by the authors. The scrutinizing stage 2 filters the irrelevant work which is done by skimming the whole content of the work. Further, while writing the manuscript if the scrutinized work content doesn't seem to fit or the information in the work is already covered in some other considered study, then the work is eliminated. For instance, to gather the information in the field of Artificial Intelligence, the keyword \u2018Artificial Intelligence in healthcare\u2019 is used for searching in Elsevier platform from which the initial screening is performed by analyzing the title whether it is relevant to our study or not. Then, the abstract of the identified works is scanned to scrutinize it and further the content of the work is skimmed to scrutinize it as well as to grasp the necessary information which constitutes the scrutinizing stages 1 and 2 respectively.",

Starting from testing to treatment, various innovations have been implemented and experimented. For instance, the testing procedures for COVID-19 have been carried out in different phases from short time results with less accuracy to high accuracy testing in tradeoff with time. Generally, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 which is quite an accurate method as it detects the presence of viral RNA. Other techniques include serologic testing, antigen testing etc. (Verdict Medical devices, 2020). Testing a voluminous population is necessary to give a big picture of the infection status and thus, the demand for the testing kits is in peak. The technique adopted for testing might vary from place to place, for populous countries antibody tests can be effective for initial screening to know the immune nature of the population and to map the infection. Moreover, they can yield results in a short period and rapid antibody testing would consume around 15\u201330 min to give the results (India Today, 2020). Bosch developed an innovative quick test to produce the results in two and a half hours and claims that it is one of the world's completely automatic molecular diagnostic tests (Verdict Medical devices, 2020). AI and ML have been contributed in many ways which is discussed in upcoming sections. They changed the way of approach in interacting and handling the patients, provides insight in predicting the infection spreading rate, innovative approaches in diagnosing the disease and identify those who would develop serve symptoms, and whatnot. Another new approach by a group of researchers and engineers of San-Francisco called Cough for the Cure which uses trained model to identify COVID-19 with the audio samples of the patient's cough (Verdict Medical devices, 2020). Though it might not seem to be effective as it is not clear whether COVID-19 cough is unique but the approach is novel. And the usage of telehealth services has exponentially risen during the pandemic period.",

Only residential load and industries running for supplying basic needs for the society would draw power from the grid. As a case study, we have analyzed the power consumption data for the southern region of India from 20 March to 29 March 2020 (POSOCO, 2020). The reason for choosing this period is that only during this period, India announced the complete lockdown in two stages. Initially, on 22 March, one-day curfew was established and then, a complete lockdown for 21 subsequent days was executed from 25 March 2020. The graph below (Fig. 3\n) shows the variation of power consumption in the Southern region of India from 20 March to 29 March 2020. From the graph, we can notice a drop in power demand on 22 March corresponding to the one-day curfew and similarly, the power demand decreases during complete lockdown period which was initiated from 25 March. As a whole, on 20 March 2020, the power demand was 533.01 Mega Units (Mu) whereas on 29 March 2020, the power demand was 394.67 Mega Units (Mu) which is almost 26% reduction in the demand power.",

The communication should impart awareness among the public for such an emerging infection and should be clear regarding what the health care system knows and that does not about COVID 19. The information must be updated as soon as verified by the authorities and at the same time, risk perception of the public should also be considered depending on the dose of the information. The challenge can be overcome by carefully addressing the information to the mass public in such a way that the information does not increase the panic among the people. For example, if the quarantine period is extended for an additional 2 weeks, then the information should also carry a solution for by how people can access the basic need. This will favor in reducing the panic among the people. When the update is small to report, the mass media can add the basic infection control information and other pieces of information which will impart awareness among people (Ratzan et al., 2020).",

This would result in ineffective cooperation from the public side for the health policies which will lead to grave danger (Weinstein, 1988; Slovic, 1987).

This is an upgraded communication model of one presented by Zhang et al., 2020 with a message \u2013 centered approach. The model comprises of four interaction medium that is the healthcare system \u2013 experts, government \u2013 experts, government \u2013 public, and expert \u2013 public. Here the government is the supreme decision-maker in controlling the activities and the decision will have an impact on the public which can be observed from their behavior as feedback. The government\u2013public communication is typically an external communication and the information to be conveyed must be complete and accurate. The public must remain optimistic to cooperate with the government and perceive the importance of the information conveyed by the government. The actual public response is compared with expected one and needs to be evaluated for effective communication (Charlebois and Summan, 2015) and often the government is frustrated by unrealistic public demands (Covello et al., 1987). Also, the public's feedback would help the government to reshape its communication strategies (Covello et al., 1987; European Food Safety Authority, 2017). The government \u2013 expert communication is the key for the whole risk management and decision-making policies and it acts as internal communication. The expert panel consists of expertise in professional knowledge, management, and technology. They are empowered by the government bodies and they give the data, evidence for the risk communication. They assess the risk and help in making a rational decision which best benefits the society (Renn, 2008; Savage, 1951; French, 2012). Expert \u2013 healthcare system communication is the source for assessing the risk or potential impact the identified problem would cause and is regarded as internal communication. Healthcare system is the one which accurately knows the seriousness of the epidemic, what health facilities it requires, how much time it needs, precaution steps to tackle the situation. This is communicated to experts which in turn to government to raise the fund towards the need, making decisions, or informing the public. The expert \u2013 public communication is required to bridge the gap between them and it depicts an external communication. The public usually fails to understand the complexity of the risk analyzed or involved. Thus, experts can play a role to convey the issue in a more simple and explicit way to make the public understand and act according to the facts (Gesser-Edelsburg et al., 2015). In general, risk communication management should neither be too centralized nor be too de-centralized (Conrow, 2003).",

The filtration of false news especially in social media is impractical but steps have been taken consistently to reduce the same. Moreover, it's a decentralized way of information communication and hence, its control on spreading false information is in the hands of users. It is highly recommended to the public to follow a reputed or official page where verified information is provided. It is reported that Facebook blocked all the health pronouncements related to COVID-19 except official sites and Pinterest made all of its search related to COVID 19 posts, created and approved by WHO (Ratzan et al., 2020). Matteo Cinelli et al. analyzed mainstream platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and YouTube and also some regulated social media platforms and from their analysis, they suggest that the spreading of information is due to the interaction of specific patterns of a group of users engaged with the topic (Cinelli et al., 2020). Thus, study related to social dynamics caused by the consumption of false content is needed to control the misinformation spreading among different mainstreams. A piece of evidence also shows that the high exposure to and sharing of fake news in the US has been identified to be concentrated on comparatively sub-sections of the population (Guess et al., 2019; Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017). Another study suggests that the government and social media companies should develop and test interventions combined with independent behavioral scientists (Van Bavel et al., 2020).",

            "text": "The widely used application of AI and ML are forecasting and classification of data. It is reported that an AI-based start-up BlueDot uses an infection-surveillance system all around the clock which scans for more than 100,000 online articles across the globe in 65 languages for every 15 min. On 30 December 2019, the algorithm noted an unusual bump in \u2018pneumonia cases\u2019 with \u2018unknown reason\u2019 in Wuhan, China and it alerted the outbreak of disease much before it has officially identified as COVID 19 (Diginomica, 2020). Thus, these eye-opening technologies can predict such epidemics and alert humanity to take the necessary advanced measures. Companies like BlueDot and Metabiota employs natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to perform analysis of health-care reports in different languages and their predictive tools can also be employed to trace the potential infection hubs from the air-travel data. For instance, public report of Metabiota listed the countries which include China, Italy, Iran and the US will likely to report new cases and the reality isn't differed much (MIT Technology Review, 2020a). A data-based analysis by Constantinos Siettos et al. forecasted the outbreak in Hubiei, China up to 29 February 2020, considering the data reported between 11 January and 10 February 2020. They forecasted that a minimum infection would be 45,000 and the death count will be around 2700. And the infected number was around 67,000 and the death count was in the 2800 s which is close (ITN, 2020a). From these incidents, we can infer that AI and ML can be used for predicting the situation and based on which we can act accordingly to reduce the intensity of outbreaks. Data classification along with prediction is significant because it can give a clear idea of how to deal with the data. For example, during the outbreak, there is a demand for identifying the extent of infection cases from mild to critical illness. One such analysis was carried out by Xiangao Jiang et al. in which the AI framework was used to find the COVID outbreak and the patients at critical illness based on the data from two hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China (Jiang et al., 2020). The predictive model developed was 70% to 80% accurate with the predicted critical cases. Such an analysis would have helped the clinical infrastructure to meet the upcoming healthcare product demand. Also, Lishi Wang et al. had developed a patient information-based algorithm to predict and estimate the mortality caused by COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020a).",

Supervised learning techniques are employed in prognosis and biomarkers prediction. ML approaches are used in the design of prognostic markers include regression models and classification and regression trees (Zlobec, 2005). Artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed in the analysis of marker studies (Zafeiris et al., 2018; Bertolaccini et al., 2017). Unsupervised learning is widely used in identifying biological samples and classifying them. It is useful in identifying homogeneous subgroups within the heterogeneous clinical outcomes. This type of learning is helpful in treating breast cancer patients (Perou et al., 2000; Sorlie et al., 2001; Dai et al., 2015). Dente et al. used machine learning algorithms to recognize the predictive profiles of bacteremia and pneumonia in the patients treated for combat wounds (Dente et al., 2017) and another utilized ML to design preliminary test models whose role is to predict whether a patient would be tested positive for a specific respiratory virus (Mai and Krauthammer, 2017). AI and ML have been significantly boosting the discoveries in genetics and molecular medicine field which also impact on developing vaccines (Hamet and Tremblay, 2017). So, the role of these technologies in prediction and classification of data is vital in any situation and also one should not blindly believe the outcomes. The predicted outcomes should be evaluated along with cognitive thinking to yield a better solution.",

Heinson et al. used ML in reverse vaccinology whose purpose is to distinguish the bacterial protective antigens (BPAs) from non-bacterial protective antigens and this would boost the progress of developing vaccines (Heinson et al., 2017). Studies also suggest that AI will assist in the drug development field to analyze the possible outcomes in using a clinical trial drug (Doyle et al., 2015) and also to identify the response in the patient body (Vidyasagar, 2015; Hall et al., 2017). Another problem in the medical field of intensive care is the individual ventilator setting for each patient. Steven Ganzert et al. presented a solution for this problem using ML based on data obtained from intensive care. They analyzed various methods of determining pressure-volume curves in artificially ventilated patients suffering from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and implemented ML in recognizing the method for the given pressure-volume curve and also in predicting the volume with the given pressure, method and patient data (Ganzert et al., 2002).

Ramesh Raskar and team at MIT Media Lab developed an app called Private Kit: Safe Paths that would track one's travelling path and can see whether the person has come in contact with an infected individual without knowing who it is. By means of this one can perceive whether the infected person is near them along with other features (MIT Technology Review, 2020b). Also, other dimension of security issues prevails and apart from it, this app alerts us where the infection has been and might make users believe that the certain places aren't safe. These can be effective only when the people use it and tracking coronavirus hotspots have proven to be effective in countries like South Korea. Artificial Intelligence is also indulged in creating tools for patients rather than only focusing on clinicians such as chatbots. They belong to special application of AI and employs natural language processing (NLP) to interpret with the general medical literacy and diagnostics (Gruson et al., 2019). These chatbots can be extended as an application to act as an interface medium for the people to buy basic necessities which can allot timings and order numbers to collect their billed things during quarantine period such that it will assist in maintaining social distancing.

As the active cases of infection is raising, it is necessary that the health care system must have a required number of medical equipment, testing facility, protection equipment. In case of COVID-19, the infection mainly spreads through tiny droplets carried in air or any surface from the cough produced by the infected person. So as a preventive measure, masks and hand sanitizers are required in large amount to satisfy the need of the public. Also, to treat infected persons, hospitals need ventilators in a massive quantity. To meet such demands, several solutions have been carried out. Dyson Ltd., a British tech company has partnered with The Technology Partnership (TTP) designed a brand-new ventilator named CoVent and it meets the standards of the clinical specification (Techcrunch, 2020). It might be challenging for industries using complex technologies for manufacturing their products to adapt for producing ventilators but several automotive industries have successfully repurposed their factory to produce different products to strengthen the health care system. Brewers and distillers were restructured their production system to produce hand sanitizer and alcohol-based disinfectants and other suppliers purchases new injection molds for producing test kits (Autodesk-Redshift, 2020). Fashion brands such as Gucci, Prada, Zara have transformed their production lines to make millions of masks (NS Medical Devices, 2020). All these infer the adaptable nature of manufacturing technology used and their crisis response is satisfying the health care system needs. Also, 3D printing techniques have provided support by manufacturing some key small parts. For instance, Isinnova, an Italian 3D printing company was able to 3D print a valve designed by Decathlon that connected the mask to the conventional hospital respirator (World Economic Forum, 2020b). In the hospital, purchasing of medicines, stocking of medicinal products, handling waste, all have to be managed by health care workers. As the number of patients rises, it is better to apply AI technology to handle the data (Jordona et al., 2019).",

And in this pandemic, the health system is reported to have an exponential increase in the use of telemedicine technology (STAT, 2020) and the health system is also using technologies such as chatbots, video consultations etc. to minimize the load on the hospital. During the quarantine period, there exists a problem of getting basic needs for the people in order to survive especially food ingredients. This can be dealt with by opening the markets at a specific range of time in which limited people at a time can buy things they need by strictly following social distancing. For severely affected area, the supplies can be provided by the workers with protective equipment. We propose a system that can be effectively followed by the people to support social distancing. Initially, the information of available markets in an area should be collectively gathered and uploaded in a website run by some private, public or government agencies. The people can access the website and choose the market and then can give a request for their need. The people will be allotted a slot with specific time range (like between 9 and 10 am) along with a token number corresponding to the slot. The shopkeeper will be in touch with the website request and act accordingly to pack the listed things. After verifying the token number and slot timings, the things can be handover to the buyer. By implementing this, one can run the market throughout the day and this will help the mobs to effectively follow the social distancing. For the areas prone to serve infection, service may be extended to deliver them to the address provided. The Fig. 6\nrepresents the workflow for the proposed supply chain system.",

According to the study (Ying et al., 2020), in China, one of strategy utilized to resolve drug delivery issues during the epidemic period was by implementing IoT based service platform (Fig. 8\nindicates the workflow). The platform generated orders automatically based on the data of previous sales from the Hospital Information System (HIS). This can be updated and submitted by the pharmacists and then, the orders are sent to suppliers from where the medicines are delivered within a stipulated time. This had mitigated the spreading of infection during drug purchase and also, saved the resources and labor.",

Another aspect includes delivering basic needs such as food items and medicines. For the healthcare system, masks, disinfectants and other lightweight goods can be transported from local hub on a truck-and-drone delivery system which is claimed to be effective (Crisan and Nechita, 2019). Drones in logistics and first aid are regarded as emerging technologies with enormous potential and many experiments were investigated to analyze such possibilities (CISION PR Newswire, 2016). Also, in populous countries, collection of samples for testing can be done in localized approach, reducing the load on the healthcare system space and the samples can be sent to nearby testing facility by adopting drone technology for faster transportation. Certain reports showed the viability of transportation of biological samples by the deployment of the drone at room temperature and it was seen that no considerable influence on the accuracy of hematology, coagulation analysis and routine chemistry (Amukele et al., 2015; Amukele et al., 2016). Also, drones have been successful in delivering life-saving materials to the healthcare in a stimulated austere territory in which the vehicle access is far-fetched. Drones have accurately delivered medical supplies weighing 4.5 kgs to the target within a one-mile range quickly than any other means (Mesar et al., 2018). Another potential drone technology includes \u2018lab-on-a-drone\u2019 concept which is especially suitable for regions where the laboratories are located at remote places and the regions where delivery of diagnostic instruments is arduous. In this \u2018lab-on-a-drone\u2019 the sample preparation strategies and molecular diagnostic platforms are coupled with the drone and it also helps in reducing the time taken for testing the sample (Priye et al., 2016). This usage of drone technology approach can be also used in supplying food and basic needs in especially highly infected area to prevent people coming outside. But it requires a proper system of getting the public requirements which should be communicated to the supplier from which the delivery of products will happen from a localized hub. Though this involves many complications mostly due to public engagement, it might be promising in near-future (The New York Times, 2018). The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has increased the possibilities for implementing drone technology with the aid of telecommunication.",

Nursing and healthcare receiving are a labor-intensive work and robotics in the healthcare system is an encouraging solution. With the support of Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, a robot can learn itself from massive data and acquire immense intelligence. These robots can be more effective in providing diagnosis and treatment when compares to a human caregiver. Further, mobile robots have tremendous advantages in healthcare facilities (Wan et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2008). In an epidemic outbreak, the healthcare facilities will be flourished with patients. In such situations, the help of robots is highly favorable and it can assist in data analysis to treatment. In diagnosis, a well-trained robot can perceive information from the scans and can interpret whether the person has got a certain disease. This can also be applied in detecting coronavirus by training the robot with many infected individual CT scan images. A simplified robot for communication purposes, or for providing foods for patients, even scanning every person working in health care facility and asking them to wear masks or gloves if they weren't would provide a great support for healthcare individuals. In an advanced level, robot to identify stress levels of health care workers using facial recognition to monitor their health status will be fortunate. To improve healthcare services, effective communication between the robots and data centers are required. Hence, a concerned framework needs to be designed for maintaining edge computing and centralized computing which is essential for both robotics and communication communities (Liu et al., 2017; Sahni et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2018). Finally, a robot is good at performing repetitive tasks with less error relative to humans and will strengthen the healthcare facilities.",

Further, the smartphones have paved a way to access these technologies in much simpler way. In the present world, smartphones play phenomenal role as they are embedded with interactive high-quality displays, high resolution cameras, widespread connectivity to the internet and supporting for various software. Mobile application software is vital since they have the potential to connect with the world from just a hand sized device and can perform various tasks. In the pandemic situation, they can assist in number of ways ranging from offering mobile health (M-health) facility to helping farmers in logistics. M-health applications can provide clinical assistance at any time and any location thus, overcoming the geological restrictions and it helps the healthcare workers to provide optimum service via cellular technology (Pinem et al., 2020). As the world is heading towards 5G cellular communication, the M-health application would get a tremendous boost. Another perspective regarding healthcare lies in giving therapies and a study reported the use of mobile application for hand therapy (Valdes et al., 2020). Mobile applications also act as a guidance for many activities such as for performing exercise, cooking, monitoring the habits, task management and what not. Integration of technologies in market, production and supply chain handling can be effectively improved by the development of mobile applications which also influences the digitalization to some extent. Farmers are mostly affected by the logistics problem in pandemic crisis. Proper connectivity with the market with the aid of government can help the farmers to identify the demand location for their products and the subsequent supply chain requirements can be met. All these can be controlled through a mobile application effectively (Nuanmeesri, 2019). As an advanced application, the usage of augmented reality is encouraged. Even shopping can be assisted with the utilization of augmented reality during lockdown period (McLean and Wilson, 2019).",

The healthcare facilities have rapidly been modified for increasing their patient intake capacity and also improving the telehealth facilities to reduce the load on the hospitals. The testing methods and facilities are technologically enhanced to diagnose a large number of test samples in this pandemic situation. Government role in a society is important and it satisfies the needs of the healthcare system and simultaneously, helps the public in accessing the basic needs and monitoring them. Public viewpoint is to coordinate with the government and follow the social distancing and other preventive measures correctly. Industries have aligned themselves to help in meeting the demands of the healthcare system and regarding energy aspects, the power consumption by the people during the lockdown was significantly lower when compared to the time of before lockdown period. Other insights about the economical viewpoint of the society and environmental changes involving a drop in air pollutants are discussed.",

The technological strategies that aids in controlling the pandemic play around information communication, AI, ML and supply chain technologies that have a direct influence on mitigating the spreading. When considering communication, information transfer to the public is much more important to control the mass public for which media and social media creates a pathway. Then, risk perception by the people will affect the societal response to the pandemic. Hence, proper communication should be conveyed by the government to the people and it is mandatory to eliminate the rumors or false information that is potentially taking place in social media streams for which many steps have been taken by companies and government jointly. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the promising technologies that can help in numerous ways in tackling the situation. They are being adopted in the prediction of outbreaks, and in the healthcare systems for the diagnosis of disease through scans, classification of medical data, handling big data of patients, assisting in treatments and so on. Other aspects where AI is implemented in COVID-19 period are for supporting chatbots, developing apps for tracking infected people and in creating a huge database for accumulating all published SARS-Cov-2 related researches. In this situation, supply chain technologies address the production and transportation issues of prior products required by the health care system. This explains how different industries adapted their production lines to produce ventilators, masks, hand-sanitizers and other products. And this is possible only by use of technology. Further, supply chain of the basic needs required by the public also has some vacant space where tech can be implemented to avoid crowding in certain places. The technological strategies supporting the society during pandemic focusses on the implemented strategies that are helpful in supporting the public, government and health care system to make them stay at home. These strategies include work from home, distance learning and surveillance. Work from home and distance learning gives people some purposes for staying at home whereas the surveillance technologies help the government to monitor the general public and track the same. The section, viable prospective technologies deals with the potential technologies that are used less and their utilization can effectively enhance the various processes in healthcare facilities, surveillance and in avoiding direct contact with the infected persons. These technologies comprise of AI, ML and IoT, drone technology and robot technology. The various application of AI has been listed in the table along with the discussion of the possibility of their use in the current situation. Also, IoT is a crucial technology in automation which can assist in supply chain technologies to transform it to be completely automatic with the given requirements. Drone and robot technology are high tech field which had tremendously improved in recent years. Drone technology will be most appropriate for applications such as the delivery of goods, samples, surveillance and so on. Whereas, the robot technologies can have a significant impact on the healthcare facilities in numerous aspects which have been discussed briefly. And finally, we provide some essential guidelines for various social bodies to mitigate the spreading of the infection.",

This had accelerated the innovations taking place in technologies in almost every field. The online experience that the people come across during this period might have a long-term influence in online shopping, E-learning, digital payments, telehealth facilities and mobile entertainment. The core technologies that would get a boost include artificial intelligence, machine learning, Internet of Things, location and navigation technologies, augmented and virtual reality, drone technology, robotics, cloud and entertainment technologies. The situation has caused to search for alternatives and innovative technologies. For instance, the ban of biometrics for the welfare of the people during pandemic have a potential to shift the tech to other options such as facial and iris recognition technologies (GCN, 2020). The data-driven applications and responses regarding the ongoing situation will encourage the development of IT systems to enhance the tracking, detection and analysis. The telehealth technologies have been improved to handle telehealth consults which have gone up multiple folds since the pandemic. Global quarantine has put a strain on the maintenance of energy and water demands and other utilities. Hence, these utilities need monitoring of the variations in the usage patterns and thus, the supply can be redirected wherever required. Apart from it, these data can be useful to take advance actions in future outbreaks.",
