Ferret infection models are well suited to study the pathogenicity and transmissibility of Coronaviruses (SARS), Pneumoviridae (RSV) and Orthomyxoviruses that include human and avian influenza viruses (Enkirch and von Messling 2015; Oh and Hurt 2016). Ferrets are an attractive mammalian model species for these infections since ferrets and humans share similar lung physiology, and most notably a very similar (viral) receptor distribution throughout the respiratory tract (Belser et al. 2011; van Riel et al. 2006). A significant drawback of the ferret model is a lack of ferret specific reagents for detailed studies of the host immune response to these pathogens. Nevertheless, the use of the ferret model has increased over the years, and its usage, with the recent publication of the ferret (draft) genome (Peng et al. 2014), is likely to increase even further. Currently, little is known about the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of the ferret, limiting the options to monitor the immune response of ferrets to experimental infections with influenza virus and other pathogens.",

Conventional TCRs are \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b3\u03b4 heterodimers that are formed by somatic rearrangement of Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments for the \u03b2 and \u03b4 chains, and V and J gene segments for the \u03b1 and \u03b3 chains (Davis and Bjorkman 1988). Although the ratio between \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets is not known for the ferret, the \u03b1\u03b2 T cells are much more common than \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in both human and dog (Mineccia et al. 2012). The \u03b2 chain (at least in humans) tends to interact more closely with the peptide antigen than the \u03b1 chain (Glanville et al. 2017), making the TRB locus the most interesting first candidate to annotate in detail.",

We find that the TRB locus of the ferret has a similar structure to that of other mammalian TRB loci, such as mouse and human (Glusman et al. 2001), bovine (Connelley et al. 2009), dog (Mineccia et al. 2012), and rabbit (Antonacci et al. 2014): a library of V genes, followed by two (or three in bovine) D-J-C clusters. Each cluster consists of one D gene, six or seven (six in ferret) J genes, and a single C gene. The D-J-C clusters are followed by a V gene with an inverted transcriptional orientiation. We also performed a phylogenetic analysis, showing that the ferret V and J genes are indeed most closely related to those of the dog. The ferret locus is small like that of the dog, about 300 Kb, and has a (largely) conserved synteny with the dog TRB locus. Our annotation of the ferret TRB locus will enable detailed studies of T cell responses to support research on novel or improved antiviral strategies for influenza and other viral infections employing the ferret as a model organism. All TRB genes identified in our analysis (expressed or not) have been approved by the IMGT/WHO-IUIS nomenclature committee.",

RNA concentrations and OD 260:280 nm ratios were measured with the NanoDropR ND-1000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA). TCR amplification was performed according to a protocol described by Mamedov et al. (Mamedov et al. 2013). Primer sequences are provided in Table 1. Various nested primer 2 primers were used since local sequence conservation is not yet established. Briefly, RNA obtained from unsorted PBMCs was reverse transcribed by RACE using a primer directed to the constant region. Twelve nucleotide long unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated during cDNA synthesis (Kivioja et al. 2011). Subsequently, two-stage seminested and barcoded PCR amplification was performed including a size selection/agarose gel purification step after the first PCR (Mamedov et al. 2013).",

This splice variant occurs on average in more than 25% of the sequence reads that align to TRBV19 in each of the four ferrets. To be able to detect this non-functional variant, sequence reads should extend nearly 200 bp into the V-EXON region. If reads do not extend this far into the V gene, this may lead to an overestimation of the expression level of V genes having such non-functional splice variants. To this end repertoire sequencing experiments should use reads that are long enough to detect the splice variants, or perform a bias correction based on dedicated experiments quantifying the proportion of non-functional splice variants in the ferret population.",

Like in the dog, the ferret TRB locus spans about 300 Kb, which is much less than the 650 Kb long locus of humans. The ferret TRB locus contains a region of V genes followed by two D-J-C clusters. Both D-J-C clusters span about 7 Kb and consist of one D gene, six J genes, followed by a C gene. About 11 Kb downstream of the second D-J-C cluster, there is a TRBV gene (TRBV30) with an inverted transcriptional orientation. In the ferret, IMGT classified TRBV30 as a pseudogene because of a missing DONOR-SPLICE. Instead, the homologous TRBV30 in both human and dog is functional.",

Both TRBJ2-1 and TRBJ2-5 are also classified as an ORF due to having a noncanonical J-NONAMER. Although TRBJ1-3 is a pseudogene (because of a stop codon), it can still lead to functional transcripts by VDJ recombination, as it is used in about 3% of the TCRB clonotypes (Fig. 6b). Like other mammalian species such as human, mouse, dog, and rabbit (Antonacci et al. 2014), the ferret TRBC genes consist of 4 exons each (Fig. 4). The TRBC genes of the ferret are identical to each other for the first 2 exons (EX1 and EX2), and differ by only 2 nt in EX3 and also by 2 nt in EX4. The FG loop is one amino acid longer than the longest TRBC FG loop described by IMGT (Lefranc et al. 2005). We extended the numbering of the FG loop to accommodate the additional amino acid (Fig. 4).

Like in the dog, the ferret TRB locus is relatively small (300 Kb) and both contain about 20 functional TRBV genes.
