Fifteen million humans die every year of infectious diseases, the five \u2018big killers\u2019 being AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory infections and infantile diarrhoea [6, 7]. In the last decades, a number of new pathogens responsible for emerging infectious diseases, such as avian and swine flu, AIDS, SARS, West Nile, Ebola and variant of Creutzfeldt\u2010Jacob disease (vCJD) have been identified and other infectious diseases are re\u2010emerging after a period of quiescence, such as malaria and tuberculosis caused by multi\u2010drug resistant strains [2, 5, 6, 8, 9]. The picture is compounded by the so\u2010called \u2018deliberately emerging\u2019 pathogens, such as anthrax and smallpox \u2013 biological weapons that humans might plan to spread deliberately as an act of bioterrorism [2, 6, 9].",

The ability of an infectious agent to mutate and to jump the barrier species from animals to humans contributes to the emergence of zoonotic diseases.

The \u2018bad\u2019 news consists of strands of DNA or RNA that are able to penetrate mammalian cells, obliging them to reproduce the viral components instead of their own. The bad news can get even worse as viruses adapt continually to the environment by mutation, recombination or gene reassortment [2, 15]. The two key features of intracellular replication and genetic evolution make viral infections particularly difficult to combat: currently available anti\u2010viral agents block viral replication by various mechanisms, but hardly remove dormant viruses that have already penetrated inside host cells and the protection conferred by vaccination can be made fruitless by genetic evolution of the pathogen, which may enable it to escape previously induced immunity.",

Its natural reservoir is a non\u2010human primate, called Pan troglodytes troglodytes, in which it is fairly harmless. Man became probably infected through contacts with infected blood during hunting and slaughtering processes (\u2018bush meat\u2019, hunter\u2019s cut) about 60\u201370 years ago [16]. The infection remained confined to areas of Africa up to about 40 years ago when international travelling and exchanges became more widespread. Infected subjects moved from Africa to Haiti; from there, the infection then spread, as a result of sex tourism, first to gay communities in cities of North America (Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York) and then to Europe. At first, it spread in high\u2010risk groups, such as male homosexuals, intravenous drug abusers and recipients of multiple transfusions; then, it extended to the general population. The outcome is the current pandemic: in 2008, WHO estimated that 33 million adults and children were living with HIV infection/AIDS worldwide, that more than 40 million people have died of the disease so far and that the number of deaths in the last year amounted to 2 million [17].",

This emerging airborne viral disease had a great impact on account of its rapid international spread under favourable conditions created by our highly mobile, closely interconnected world. The origin of SARS was in areas of dense population in southern China, where humans and animals are packed side by side providing ideal conditions for a new virus to emerge by jumping across species. The natural reservoir of SARS virus (SARS\u2010CoV) is the horseshoe bat, the spillover host is the masked palm civet or raccoon dog; man is an aberrant host [18]. The pandemic originated in Guangdong, in Southern China, where families often cohabit with the animals they rear. The promiscuity enabled the SARS\u2010CoV to skip across species and find a new host \u2013 man. It has been documented how the first identified infected human (index case) unintentionally infected another 13 humans in the Metropole hotel in Hong Kong, who then travelled to five different countries (Germany, Canada, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore), giving rise to new foci of infection. This ultimately led to a worldwide epidemic affecting more than 8000 people, with a death rate of 9.6% [19]. This event showed how modern transport systems can enable an emerging infection in one part of the earth to spread rapidly throughout the globe. However, it also showed how international healthcare co\u2010operation can achieve control of a rising pandemic within less than a year.",

Some viruses adopt the so called \u2018hit and run\u2019 strategy as they cause recurrent, geographically confined, usually self\u2010limiting outbreaks. This is the case of Ebola and Marburg viruses, both members of the family Filoviridae, causing severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fevers in humans and non\u2010human primates. In 1976, transmission of Ebola virus from its natural reservoir, which is still unknown, to man resulted in two simultaneous but separate, explosive outbreaks of human disease caused by two distinct virus subtypes in Zaire and Sudan with a case\u2010fatality rate of approximately 90% and 50% respectively. The disease was self\u2010limited both in space and time: it remained confined to well\u2010defined geographical areas and mysteriously resolved [20]. Since then, recurrent outbreaks have been reported in African countries including Sudan, Gabon, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Uganda. A variant of the African Ebola virus, the Reston virus, was first identified in 1989 in Reston, Virginia, USA and in 1992 in Italy (Siena) in colonies of cynomolgus macaques imported from the Philippines [21]. Despite its high pathogenicity in non\u2010human primates, this virus does not seem to cause disease in humans. The infection by the Marburg virus followed a similar course: in 1967, German laboratory workers were infected by African green monkeys belonging to the Cercopithecus aethiops species imported from Uganda and developed fatal haemorrhagic fever [22, 23]. Since then, sporadic cases and outbreaks have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1998\u20132000, Angola in 2004\u20132005 and Uganda in 2007. In July 2008, an imported case of Marburg haemorrhagic fever was diagnosed in the Netherlands in a Dutch woman who became infected by visiting a bat cave while travelling in Uganda [24].",

Ecological factors, such as new routings of long\u2010distance bird migrations and the increased long\u2010distance air travel facilitate the movement of infected persons, livestock and exotic arthropod vectors around the world contributing to the spread of vector\u2010borne diseases from the original niches to new geographical areas. Changing in public health policy, insecticide and drug resistance are additional factors which can contribute to the emergence or resurgence of vector\u2010borne infectious diseases [25]. An example is the West Nile Virus (WNV) infection, originally confined to Africa (along the Nile), Southern Europe, parts of the Middle East and India, which has recently modified its epidemiological picture. In 1999, WNV was firstly imported into the New York area and, thanks to the presence of specific vectors (Culex mosquito) and natural susceptible hosts (crows, jays), the infection rapidly spread coast to coast.",

In 2007, the CHIKV transmitted by this mosquito caused the first autochthonous epidemic outbreak in Europe, in the north\u2010east of Italy (Emilia Romagna Region) which involved more than 200 cases [29, 30].

            "text": "Influenza A is an airborne virus that repeatedly produces epidemics every year during the cold season. Its hosts include birds (natural reservoir) and a number of mammals, including whales, seals, horses, pigs and man. It is particularly able to adapt to new hosts, thanks to its unique capacity for genetic variation: its surface proteins are able to mutate up to 50% of their amino acid sequence without losing their capacity to infect mammalian cells and its genome is made of eight RNA segments that are genetically independent and that can therefore randomly reassort, forming antigenically novel subtypes [31]. Such novel strains have caused a number of dangerous pandemics in the past, such as the Spanish flu in 1918, Asian flu in 1957 and Hong\u2010Kong flu in 1968. Currently, Avian flu is a real threat caused by mutated strain H5N1, which continues to spread in humans. The cumulative number of human cases of Avian Influenza H5N1 reported by WHO by 11 August 2009 amounted to 438 cases and 262 deaths [32]. The issue is whether this virus or other avian viruses (H9N2, H7N7) will cause a novel pandemic or not [33]. To cause a pandemic, three characteristics are required: (i) the ability of the virus to replicate in a human host, (ii) the population has to be susceptible to it, and (iii) human\u2010to\u2010human transmission has to be possible. At present, for H5N1, the first two features are satisfied, but not the third. However, it cannot be excluded that it will develop the third feature in the future.",

This novel strain is a cause for concern as it has resulted from the unique reassortment of genetic elements of influenza viruses that normally infect three different kinds of host \u2013 swine, birds and human beings. The study of its structure has revealed that it differs considerably from its predecessors, isolated in human beings: its H antigen, which enables it to bind and infect cells of different species, has changed in terms of amino acid sequence alignment by approximately 27% and its N antigen, which enables it to digest sialic acids (neuraminidase activity), ensuring better access and spread in the organism, has changed by about 18%. This means that exposure to its predecessors may not provide any immunity to this unique strain and the whole population on earth is theoretically at risk [35]. Indeed, in April 2009, WHO declared a phase\u20105 alert indicating that a pandemic was imminent and that it was urgent to finalize the organization, communication and implementation of the pandemic preparedness plans. On June 11, 2009 WHO then announced the beginning of a flu pandemic with a total of 29 669 cases worldwide and 145 deaths. Only one month later, on July 6, 2009, WHO reported that the number of infections had increased up to nearly 100 000 with 429 deaths. Laboratory\u2010confirmed cases as officially reported to WHO as of 14 August 2009 amount to 182 166 with 1799 deaths.

The new prion disease that emerged in man in the UK in 1996 was a food\u2010borne infection caused by modern intensive meat production based on \u2018industrial cannibalization\u2019: a prion disease that has been known to affect sheep and goats for more than 200 years (scrapies) had been transmitted to cattle via inadequately sterilized fodder of animal origin, giving rise to an epidemic of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), also called \u2018mad cow disease\u2019, which in turn was then transmitted to man via meat consumption. Prion\u2010infected humans develop a variant of classic sporadic Creutzfeld\u2010Jakob disease (vCJD), an invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. It is not known what proportion of prion\u2010infected humans develop symptomatic disease. Also, the mean latency period from prion infection to the development of overt disease remains unknown. Over the period 1996\u20132007, a total of 161 cases were reported, nearly all in the UK and attributed to dietary exposure. Possible transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion has been documented in the UK [37]. The emergence of prion disease has led to a reduction in the number of donors as people with a history of visiting the UK during the cattle BSE epidemic are excluded. Recently, the prion protein has been found in the spleen during the postmortem examination of a 70\u2010year\u2010old patient suffering from haemophilia who died of causes unrelated to vCJD. Indeed, this patient did not have any neurological symptoms before death [38]. Of some concern is the fact that in 1996, this patient received a batch of factor VIII manufactured using plasma from a donor who developed symptoms of vCJV 6 months after donation.

            "text": "The development of new antimicrobial drugs and antibiotics together with the availability of safe and effective vaccines led to a spirit of optimism towards the definitive control and prevention of several infectious diseases. Man may have won some battles against infectious diseases, but the war is still raging and the end is not in sight. In general, there is no way to predict when or where the next pathogens will emerge. Emerging and resurging diseases are common in areas rich in wild animals and where natural and social environmental factors, including man\u2019s activities, increase the opportunities for the pathogens to extend their ecological niches and to be transferred to and from humans and other animals. The continual emerging of new infectious agents and re\u2010emerging of drug resistant strains of old ones are issues with far reaching consequences. Infectious diseases have always been present in society and are destined to remain part of human life in the future.",
