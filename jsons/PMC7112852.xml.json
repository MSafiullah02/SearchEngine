Since 1979 the original type 2 underwent extensive antigenic changes and was fully replaced by the antigenic variants CPV-2a and CPV-2b (Mochizuki et al., 1993a, De Ybanez et al., 1995, Greenwood et al., 1996, Truyen et al., 1996, Truyen et al., 2000, Sagazio et al., 1998, Buonavoglia et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2000). The variants -2a and -2b differ from the original type CPV-2 by a few amino acid changes in the VP2 protein, that account for an extended host range in vivo ed in vitro and for increased affinity to canine transferrin receptors (Parker et al., 2001, Hueffer et al., 2003). A new antigenic variant, type 2c, has been reported in dogs in Europe and Southern Asia (Buonavoglia et al., 2001, Nakamura et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2006c).",

Parvoviruses possess a non-enveloped capsid surrounding a single-stranded DNA genome of about 5 kb in length. The genome has two open reading frames (ORF). ORF2 encodes the two capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2 while ORF1 encodes two nonstructural (NS) proteins, NS1 and NS2, that are translated by alternative splicing of the transcribed RNA (mRNA). As a result, NS2 contains 87 amino-terminal amino acids in common with NS1 joined to 78 amino acids from an alternative open reading frame at the 3\u2032-end of the ORF1 (Wang et al., 1998).",

CPV shedding in the faeces reaches high loads in the first days after infection, with a rapid decrease at 10\u201311 days post-infection (Decaro et al., 2005a, Elia et al., 2005). Also, in the late stage of infection the antibodies in the gut lumen may sequestrate most virus particles (Decaro et al., 2005c; Desario et al., 2005). Furthermore, as CPV-2-induced cytopathic effect in cell cultures is often not evident, staining by immunofluorescence is required, with additional laboratory work.",

Thus far, a number of nucleic acid amplification techniques for the detection of CPV-2 have been described. However, all such techniques are targeted to CPV-2 DNA and a specific molecular method for detection of infectious CPV-2 particles was not available. Parvovirus DNA appears to be stable and low levels of DNA of human parvovirus B19 have been detected in serum and tissues for months after acute infection (Soderlund-Venermo et al., 2002). High titres of CPV-2 DNA can been detected for several weeks in blood in dogs even after the virus has disappeared from the intestinal content (Decaro et al., unpublished data). Also, during parvovirus replication in vitro, defective genomes may be generated and the real infectious virus titres may be overrated (Holland, 1991, Tempesta et al., 1998). The synthesis of parvovirus mRNAs is considered a marker of virus infection in cells (Bostic et al., 1999) and therefore accurate estimate of the viral RNA transcripts may be exploited as a good proxy for evaluation of virus replication.",

However, viral mRNA loads were not strictly correlated with the counterpart DNA titres, since in some tissues there were high viral DNA loads, but low RNA titres or no mRNA at all. The reasons for these inconsistencies may be threefold: (i) some tissues are not permissive to CPV-2 replication and the detection of viral DNA could be a consequence of the viraemia; (ii) the quantity of mRNA may depend on the stage of cell infection, decreasing as the infection course proceeds; (iii) viral RNA in some tissues may undergo quick degradation by the tissue RNases and therefore improper conservation after repeated cycles of freezing and thawing or even delayed storage of samples may result in the loss of virus mRNA (Peirson and Butler, 2007).",

Involvement of the CNS tissues during parvovirus infection has been described in cats and virus replication in the nervous tissues may result in the onset of neurological signs (Csiza et al., 1972, Wilcox et al., 1984, Url et al., 2003). By converse, in dogs CPV antigen has never been detected in neurons, despite the presence of neurodegeneration (Agungpriyono et al., 1999, Url and Schmidt, 2005). In a recent study on CPV-2 distribution in tissues (Decaro et al., 2007), high titres of viral genome were detected in the CNS with median titres above 106\n DNA copies/10 \u03bcl of template. In agreement with these results, we could observe the presence of CPV-2 mRNA in the brain and cerebellum tissues. This finding does not necessarily support the conclusion that neurons are permissive to CPV-2 replication as the presence of a full set of viral mRNAs may not be followed by the production of a full set of viral proteins (Gallinella et al., 2000). In addition, in our study virus mRNA was not extracted from individual cell types and therefore the precise source of the CPV-2 mRNA is not certain. Whether inflammatory cells rather than neurons were the actual source of the detected mRNA remains to be elucidated in future trials.",
