This approach may not be as effective as policy makers expect if they ignore the current reality of global human mobility. Another important decision-making factor that has been overlooked is how to impose internal movement control policies, such as curfew or other forms of travel restriction, in the infected areas. These issues are particularly important in designing a global strategy to respond to the COVID-19 dynamics and to recover social and economic activities. Figure 1 below summarizes three different views on understanding the role of human mobility in the pandemic. The first is a focal view that addresses the role of internal mobility and movement controls in tackling epidemic in a single country while ignoring the influence of inbound and outbound mobility [7] [8] [9] [10] . The second is a dyadic view that explores the role of international mobility and travel restriction between a centric country (usually a hotspot area in the epidemic) and some other countries [11] [12] [13] . This approach usually does not take into account the impact of population movements other than those of the centric country, and in addition, only the one-way impact of the centric country on other countries. The third is a holistic view that analyzes the multiple paths of international mobility and travel restrictions in a global network simultaneously and allow for the correlation of each path in the network. In this way, the networked approach allows the study of simultaneous and asymmetric effects between multiple countries through different mobility pathways.",

Table   S4 presents the calculation results. Betweenness centrality of a node is the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes in a network. A high betweenness of a node reflects its high probability to occur on a shortest path between any two nodes. The findings imply that the United States, the Netherlands and Italy act as such top 3 bridges to facilitate the international transmission of the pandemic in the global network over the past three months. The closeness centrality of a node is the average length of the shortest path between the node and all other nodes in a network. A high closeness of a node reflects its closeness to other nodes in a network. The findings suggest that the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Africa are such countries that closely link to the rest countries in the international transmission of the pandemic. Similarly, Eigenvector centrality of a node measures its relative importance in term of the influence to other nodes in a network, based on the concept that connections to high-importance nodes contribute more to the importance of the node. A high eigenvector score means that a node is connected to many nodes who themselves also have high eigenvector scores. In Table S4 , the United States, the Netherlands and South Africa are the top-3 influential countries in the international transmission of the pandemic. All indicators taken together, the United States and the Netherlands play a most crucial role in the international transmission network of the pandemic.",

That is, all the associations between China's cumulative infection number and the outbreak in other 19 countries with direct flights are insignificant (Note that China has no direct flights to Brazil and Ecuador). The main reason may be due to China's early restriction on internal movement and its restriction on non-essential international travel outbound from China in late January. Travel restrictions imposed on China by many other countries in February and March might also help control international transmission from China. Other similar cases are South Korea and Iran, in which the epidemics have been well isolated, as their infection numbers are not associated with other countries' lagged epidemics.

Restrictions on non-essential international human mobility between countries are one critical strategy to fight against epidemic outbreaks 6 ; however, little was known before regarding the proper ways to implement the strategy. As such, policymakers might focus only on the hotspot areas with a high transmission rate (which is not wrong) but overlook the pathway effect beyond the epidemic areas in the global network. Unfortunately, over the past three months, we have observed such a narrow perspective repeatedly occurring in many countries, focusing only on cutting off hotspot outbreak areas. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently start to question where the coronavirus that hit New York state came from: \"\u2026\u2026We closed the front door with the China travel ban, which was right\u2026\u2026but we left the back door open because the virus had left China by the time we did the China travel ban\" 22 .
