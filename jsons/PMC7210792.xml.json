He compares the effects of a sudden tragedy to the effects of an anticipated catharsis in the mind and body of the sufferer. The notion of catharsis is closely related to \u201cpurification\u201d or \u201cpurgation\u201d. In 2008 it was the \u201cglobal economic pandemic\u201d that infected world economy and society in general. Bailout rescue funds were widely distributed by the European Commission, the Central European Bank, and the IMF to EU-Member states, and the main question arising refers to the extent to which these funds induced a \u201cpurification\u201d of the chronic problems of the Greek health system. The main purpose of this editorial is to review the plethora of measures implemented in Greece during the economic crisis, to assess their degree of success in leading to the much awaited \u2018catharsis\u2019.",

Given the commitment of the European health model [1] to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and universality in the access to health services, several reforms have been introduced aiming at improving health outcomes in a cost-effective way in the European setting. The recent economic crisis introduced a new impetus in the balancing of economic and social objectives within the health systems. The decline in GDP and the corresponding reduction in health expenditures have jeopardized the ability of the European governments to meet the obligations stemming from the European values of equity, efficiency, and effectiveness [1]. The Commission called the member countries to revisit their strategies and adapt to the changing macro-economic environment by introducing more resilient policies.",

Their findings revealed that Greece is the country with the highest levels of health polarization in both periods.

Even before the crisis, the Greek healthcare system was suffering from a series of inefficiencies relating to structural problems in the public administration, financial pressures and the failure to contain health expenditure growth. In the pre-crisis period (1980\u20132009), the system faced serious economic problems due to tax evasion, corruption, waste of public money, considerable inefficiencies in the operation of public hospitals, lack of transparency, absence of cost containment measures and an ineffective and inefficient primary health care system. Until 2009, the National Health System of Greece was notorious for not using any monitoring tools to collect and analyze information on its performance. The distribution of health resources in the regions was mainly based on historical and political criteria, such as fragmented reforms, which were the result of political pressure and client-based relations. Consequently, the NHS was characterized by uneven, unequal and inadequate distribution of health and financial resources. In addition, there was a mismatch between the existing public funding allocation for health and citizens' expectations, which stem from the limited participation of citizens in health policy-making and prioritization.",

A DEA analysis has indicated that only 23.2% of the hospitals were fully efficient, 37.5% were only efficient, while 39.3% were inefficient [6]. These results could be attributed to several chronic issues regarding medical procedures in Greece, such as the inadequate medical guidelines, the absence of medical protocols and medical records, the fragmentation of services combined with poor coordination between them, and the insufficient supervision by regional or national authorities. Many healthcare units were subject to understaffing, low number of nurses compared to doctors, unbalanced distribution of specialized doctors, lack of GPs and an absent referral system. Moreover, there has been no successful initiative promoting prevention for several years. Inefficiencies are also observed in primary healthcare. Several studies have measured the efficiency of rural health centers across Greece. Results indicate that the mean technical efficiency level was under 60% [7].",

According to OECD data, pharmaceutical expenditure accounts for 1.5% of GDP on average across the OECD countries [7]. Greece was classified among the highest spenders with 2.5% of GDP devoted to pharmaceutical care [7]. Examination of the evolution of pharmaceutical expenditure in the pre-crisis period of 2000\u20132009 among the OECD countries, shows that Greece has the highest annual rate of growth (1.1% per annum). The corresponding average growth rate among the OECD countries was less than one third (3.5% per annum).

During the economic crisis, the Greek populations lost 3.4 HLY [13] over the period 2006\u20132016. In 2006 Greece enjoyed a high level of health with 68.1 HLY. However, after the onset of the economic crisis this index was reduced substantially to 64.7 HLY. It should be noted that in the case of other Memorandum Countries with similar socio-economic background, like Cyprus, the corresponding index of HLY increased over the same period by 5.4 HLY (from 64.4 HLY in 2006 to 68.8 HLY in 2016).",

EU policy objectives focus on certain values rooted in the long history of European nations. However, while it is easier to agree on some shared values, it is much harder to implement these. The Greek case study, with its positive and negative aspects of health reforms can be a useful example of the wide range of austerity policies implemented and the augmented social benefits and risks. The Coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and has become one of the biggest threats to the global economy. We do not know how long it will last and what is its impact on inequality, unemployment, and the economic growth. The OECD [17], in its March 2020 report downgrades economic forecast for all economies across the world. The governor of the Bank of Greece forecasts zero economic growth, while the Morgan Stanley projects a 5.3 recession in Greece [18]. Despite of its negative effects on society and economy, the crisis should be viewed as a \u201cwindow opportunity\u201d to rethink the European values and implement the relevant effective policies, if \u2018catharsis\u2019 is to ever be achieved.",
