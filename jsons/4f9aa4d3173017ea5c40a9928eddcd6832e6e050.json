Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment and skilled staff limit the use of these time-consuming molecular techniques. Recently, several easy to perform rapid antigen detection tests were developed and recommended in some countries as the first line of diagnostic.",

Amongst the 106 positive RT-qPCR samples, 32 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 30.2%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid tests were also positive with RT-qPCR. Conclusions. Highest viral load is associated with better antigen detection rates. Unfortunately, the overall poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip does not allow using it alone as the frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis.",

The rapid antigen detection test is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity in nasopharyngeal samples with high viral load equivalent at least to 1.7 x 10 5 copies/mL (Ct <25), but the sensitivity declines substantially when the viral load decreases with Ct values over 30, equivalent to 9.4 x 10 3 copies/mL, which is often the case in patients suffering of COVID-19. Actually, in our study, while the specificity was 100%, the overall sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip was 30.2%. This lack of sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests for virus detection was already observed during the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic \uf05b5\uf05d. Ensuring accurate diagnosis is essential to limit the spread of the virus. The poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip leads to false negative results, which in these times of pandemic can be of great consequence. This rapid test was thought to be used as a first line COVID-19 diagnostic test in Belgium in order to possibility reduce the number of RT-qPCR testing in case of positive results, but requiring confirmation for negative results. However, because negative results cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, this test is of little use in a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",

When the nasopharyngeal secretions come into contact with the strip, passive diffusion allows the solubilized conjugate to migrate with the sample and react with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies immobilized onto the membrane. A control line is included in the strip to assess the correct migration of the sample. Visual interpretation of the result is performed after 15 minutes. Two versions of the test were evaluated. On the second version, conjugate was coupled on a different way and the control line was optimized.",

The median Ct value of these positive RT-qPCR amongst patients with no symptoms was 32.5 (mean: 31.6; range: 18-38), equivalent to a median of 2.2 x 10 3 copies/mL. The median time of symptom duration before the sampling date was four days (mean: 6.6; range: 0-34). Amongst the 86 symptomatic patients, 34 (39.5%) had concordant results between RT-qPCR and rapid test with nine negative results and 25 positive results obtained with both detection methods. Discordant results with positive RT-qPCR and negative rapid test were observed for 52 samples (62.7%).Overall, among the 106 positive samples, the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip detected 32 samples(Table 1).
