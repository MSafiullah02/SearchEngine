Some of these testing platforms offer limited test menus (i.e., influenza A, influenza B, and RSV), while others are designed to detect a more comprehensive set of potential pathogens that can cause a particular infectious disease syndrome (e.g., respiratory, gastrointestinal, sepsis, meningitis) [1] [2] [3] . This chapter will describe FDA-cleared and/or CE-marked multiplex assays that are designed to detect a comprehensive set of pathogens associated with a particular infectious disease syndrome (\u226510 assays/ test). These include the BioFire (Salt Lake City, UT) FilmArray \u00ae System [4] , the GenMark (Carlsbad, CA) eSensor XT-8\u00ae [5] and ePlex\u00ae [6] , and the Luminex (Austin, TX) xTAG\u00ae [7] , nxTag \u00ae [8] , and Verigene\u00ae systems [9] .",

To accomplish this, the FilmArray pouch ( Fig. 1) integrates all of the steps of nucleic acid purification, nested multiplex PCR amplification, and automated data analysis into a closed system [4] . The pouch is created by welding two sheets of plastic film together with heat in such a fashion that fluid can move between the working areas of the pouch via channels left in the plastic. A hard plastic fitment attached to the film (indicated in Fig. 1b) provides the enzymes and buffers needed to perform the biochemical reactions in the pouch. Other reagents (#1, #2, and #3 in Fig. 1a ) are inserted between the film layers during manufacture of the pouch. The FilmArray reagents are lyophilized in the pouch, and the pouch is stored under vacuum before use. This benefits the end user in two ways. First the freezedrying process stabilizes the PCR reagents so that the pouch has a shelf life, at ambient temperature, in excess of 1 year -which simplifies the logistics of acquiring and storing the pouches. Second vacuum storage ensures that the wells of the fitment are also under vacuum. Thus the user does not need to control the volume of hydration fluid or sample that is injected into the pouch -which simplifies the steps needed to load a pouch.",

Reverse transcription and first stage PCR (PCR1) are performed in the same reaction volume and in a multiplex format, combining primer sets for all assays for a FilmArray panel in one mix. Following PCR1 amplification, the reaction is diluted approximately 100-fold to reduce the concentrations of the outer primers, nonspecific products, and first-stage PCR chemistry. The diluted reaction is then combined with a fresh PCR master mix and flooded over a 102-well array, where a second stage PCR occurs (PCR2). Each well of the array contains assay-specific primers that anneal within the first-stage outer amplicon. At the end of PCR2, a DNA melt curve analysis of the amplicons is performed using a nonspecific DNA-binding dye, LCGreen\u00ae Plus [15] , that fluoresces in the presence of double-stranded DNA.

The nested PCR of the multiplex chemistry makes the FilmArray test remarkably resistant to PCR inhibitors that may remain after nucleic acid purification. Even modest levels of amplification in first-stage PCR can still be detected as an amplicon in the inner, nested product of PCR2. The dilution step following the firststage amplification reduces the complexity of the input material to the second-stage reaction enough that, in most cases, the DNA-binding dye detects the presence of a single amplicon in the reaction (the melt curve analysis serves as an additional filter for the correct product).",

First the nucleic acid sample purification starts with a relatively large volume of the sample (100 \u03bcl for the RP and GI panels, 60 \u03bcl for the BCID), and, nominally, all of the nucleic acid purified from this volume is delivered to the combined reverse transcription -first-stage PCR reaction. Unlike some benchtop protocols, there is no dilution from the purified nucleic acid into an RT step and a second dilution into a PCR. Secondly the pouch is controlled by pneumatic actuators (described below) that can move liquid between blisters of the pouch in seconds. This minimizes the time during which nucleic acid could be degraded or PCR primers could bind to an incorrect DNA or RNA target and thus generate specific \"nonspecific\" amplicons. To the same end, the FilmArray pouch achieves a true mechanical hot start. In both the first stage and second stage PCRs, the primers do not come in contact with the DNA polymerase/Mg, dNTP mixture until both components are at or above the temperature at which polymerization will take place. This minimizes the formation of primer dimers, and higher-order multiplex primer structures in the first-stage PCR, which compete with the correct amplicons for PCR reagents. This enhances the specificity of the amplification reactions and thus increases the sensitivity of the individual PCR assays.",

A more important control for pouch function is generated by freeze-drying a small number of cells of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe into the well of the pouch fitment that receives the sample. Nucleic acid purified from these yeast cells must pass through all the steps of the pouch. Outer primers in the first-stage PCR and inner primers spotted onto the second-stage PCR array are designed to amplify a spliced messenger RNA from the S. pombe cells (in the FilmArray BCID pouch which does not contain reverse transcriptase, the S. pombe target is a genomic DNA sequence).

However, given the increased cost of these tests, it is important to demonstrate their impact to patient management and their cost-effectiveness. It is intuitive to believe that a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostic test should improve patient management by shortening the time to the most effective therapy, by preventing inappropriate therapy (especially empiric antimicrobials), by reducing additional diagnostic testing (e.g., imaging studies), by improving the use of infection control measures, and by reducing patient length of stay. Of particular importance, these tests can reduce the unnecessary use of empiric antimicrobials by reducing the time to pathogen-directed therapy. Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for patients with serious illnesses and the inappropriate use of antibiotics in the outpatient setting \"just in case\" are important drivers of antibiotic resistance which is one of the major healthcare threats of our time. In this section, we will review what is known about the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of these multiplex panels. Because the clinical implication for each syndromic panel is different, the discussion is presented by syndrome.",

While viral culture was the gold standard, it has several limitations, including that it is a complex test requiring highly skilled laboratory workers to both set up the test and interpret the results, it is slow (taking days to complete), and only a limited number of human pathogens can be grown in viral cultures. DFA tests can be performed directly on the patient sample and can have a fast turnaround time; however, these tests are also technically complex, and the range of pathogens is limited. EIA assays can be performed in a variety of ways and are used for rapid antigen tests. Rapid antigen tests are fast and simple to use but are known to have poor test sensitivity and a limited test menu. Traditional PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific; however, they are complex and require highly trained laboratory staff and specialized laboratory facilities. In addition, each test is ordered independently placing a large burden on the ordering clinician to select the correct test or to order multiple individual tests. Due to their complexity, these tests are commonly sent to specialized reference laboratories which can increase cost and slows the time to result. The introduction of multiplex respiratory panels has allowed for comprehensive testing (ability to test viral pathogens that do not grow in cell culture and the ability to simultaneously test for bacterial and viral pathogens) in a shorter time frame. The easy-to-use systems allow the testing to be performed by laboratory workers without specialized molecular skills and in laboratories without specialized equipment and facilities. These systems allow testing to be performed closer to the patient and therefore further reduce the time to test result by reducing the need to transport samples and eliminating the delays associated with batch testing.",

[17] showed that replacing DFA testing with on-demand use of the FilmArray RP for children presenting to the emergency department (ED) resulted in dramatic reductions in test turnaround time (7 vs 1.4 h), timely (defined as within 3 h of discharge from the emergency department) administration of oseltamivir for 81% of patients testing positive for influenza, effective use of cohorting for admitted patients, and a potential saving of 900 h of ED boarding time. Similarly, in a pre-/post-intervention study of pediatric patients admitted through the ED, Rodgers et al. [18] compared several outcome measures when the FilmArray RP replaced the use of three clinicianordered traditional PCR tests (Prodesse assays for, FluA/B/RSV, PIV 1,2,3, and hMPV). The study demonstrated that use of the FilmArray RP resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients with positive test results (77.9% vs 59.8%, p < 0.001) and a 65% reduction in time to result (6.38 vs 18.65 h, p < 0.001) when compared to use of traditional PCR tests. These improvements lead to a mean reduction in length of hospital stay of 0.3 days for patients with positive test results, reduced duration of antibiotics for patients with positive test results (2.7 vs 3.2 days, p < 0.001) or when results were reported in <4 h (2.8 vs 3.2 days, p < 0.001), and an overall reduction in healthcare costs of $231/patient. Another study of 4779 pediatric patients reported significant reductions in the duration of antibiotic use (4 vs 5 days, p < 0.01), use of chest radiographs (59% vs 78%, p < 0.01), and an increase in appropriate use of isolation measures [19] .",

[20] performed a prospective randomized study of adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with respiratory symptoms over two respiratory seasons. In the control arm, patients were tested for respiratory viruses at the clinician's discretion using nine traditional PCR assays performed at a reference laboratory. In the intervention arm, all patients were tested with the FilmArray RP, and testing was performed in the ED. The study demonstrated the expected increase in pathogen detection (45% vs 15%, p < 0.0001) and reduction in time to result (2.3 vs 37.1 h, p < 0.0001) but failed to show the expected reduction in the proportion of patients that received antibiotics (84% vs 83%, p = 0.96). However, there was an increase in the proportion of patients that received a short course of antibiotics (< 48 h, 17% vs 9%, p = 0.0047) especially for patients with positive FilmArray RP test results. Patients in the intervention group also had a mean reduction in hospital length of stay of 1.1 days (5.7 vs 6.8 d, p = 0.0443) with the shortest length of stay observed in patients with positive FilmArray RP results. The use of influenza antivirals was the same in both groups (18% vs 14%, p = 0.16); however, the intervention group had a significant increase in the number of influenza-positive patients that received influenza antivirals (82% vs 47%, p = 0.0001) and a reduction in the use of antivirals for patients that were influenza-negative (18% vs 53%). In another study evaluating adult patients with a positive influenza result on a multiplex respiratory panel, Rappo [21] reported a significantly lower odds ratio for hospital admission (p = 0.046), a reduced length of stay (p = 0.040), reductions in antimicrobial duration (p = 0.032), and a reduction in the number of chest radiographs (p = 0.005).",

They observed significant increases in the use of influenza antivirals (81.0% vs 5.5-2.5%, p < 0.001) and reduced use of the antibiotics (29.5% vs 48.6-49.3%, p = 0.005) for individuals with a positive result for influenza. However, detection of non-influenza viral pathogens did not lead to a reduction in the use of antibiotics when compared to those with no pathogen detected (48.6% vs 49.3%).

Pathogen-directed therapy includes antibiotic escalation (the addition or change of dose when the current therapy is ineffective against the identified organism) and antibiotic de-escalation (discontinuation of unnecessary empiric antibiotics). A prospective randomized study conducted at the Mayo Clinic showed that antibiotic escalation occurred more quickly with or without real-time ASP oversight (5 h with BCID and ASP, 6 h with BCID only, and 24 h without BCID or ASP, p = 0.04); however, optimal antibiotic de-escalation requires oversight by an ASP (21 h with BCID and ASP, 34 h with BCID only, and 38 h without BCID or ASP, p < 0.001) [29] . The finding that multiplex molecular blood culture panels paired with an ASP results in a faster time to optimal antibiotic therapy (most narrow effective therapy) has been confirmed in several additional studies [31, 33] . The use of molecular multiplex blood culture panels has also been shown to reduce unnecessary treatment due to contaminated blood cultures [29, 34] . Reducing the use or duration of unnecessary antibiotics is important to reducing the incidence of antibiotic resistance. The cost of molecular multiplex blood culture panel and the fact that they do not replace existing testing have been raised as reasons to not use them; however, studies of the overall healthcare cost prove the panels to be cost neutral [29] [30] [31] or to reduce overall healthcare cost [30, 31, [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

The gold standard for stool pathogen testing is stool culture; however, stool culture has low diagnostic yield, is technical complexity, and has a long time to result. The yield for stool cultures is reported to be between 1.5% and 2.9% with a cost per positive result of $952 to $1200 [39] . Another commonly ordered test is O&P, which requires the collection and testing of three different stool samples. This method is also known to be technically difficult, to have low sensitivity, to be improperly used, and to have a low diagnostic yield of 1.4% [40] . As a result of the low diagnostic yield, clinicians often order multiple tests for the same stool sample, or perform testing sequentially until a causative pathogen is identified. As an example, a study conducted at a children's hospital found that a median of three tests (range 1-10) were ordered per stool sample [41] . To make matters worse, several studies have shown that clinician test ordering practices for gastroenteritis are problematic, in part due to the complexity of which pathogens are covered by what test [40, [42] [43] [44] .",

The study showed that 22% of the samples contained pathogens that should have required infection control measures, including norovirus, rotavirus, and C. difficile. Of these patients, 60% were under no or inadequate contact precautions, for a total of 109 patient days. Conversely 24.5% of the patients with negative results by the FilmArray GI Panel were unnecessarily placed under contact precautions for a total of 181 patient days. This study illustrates that without a rapid comprehensive test result, contract precautions are not rationally applied, leading to both an increased risk of nosocomial infections and unnecessary costs associated with inappropriately applied contact precautions.

Similar to social media-based disease reporting systems, the data is syndrome-based [53] . However, a unique feature of the Trend dataset is that analysis is pathogen-specific. The FilmArray RP patient test results demonstrate that a number of viruses (RSV, HMPV, PIV, and CoV) show seasonal occurrence that is similar to influenza and thus can be confused with influenza when a symptomatic diagnosis of influenza-like-illness is made. This has important implications for treatment of influenza and for determining the efficacy of influenza vaccination and thus emphasizes the value of multiplex testing for respiratory symptoms. The FilmArray Trend data also show that 7% of the FilmArray RP tests detect the presence of two or three pathogens in a single sample. The importance of this result for patient treatment is not currently clear. Clinical studies that focus on patients presenting with more than one pathogen are needed.",

In other work, the time to result for the RP panel has been decreased from 63 min for RP v1.7 to 45 min for the RP2 panel [55] . Speed, ease of use, and a comprehensive test menu are all critical features if the possibilities of point-of-care syndromic testing are to be fully realized [56] . In the longer term, additional simplification of the test setup procedure as well as reductions in the time to result should further expand the number of outpatient settings able to use multiplex testing. The data from Farrar and Wittwer [57] on \"extreme\" PCR conditions (cycle times below 1 s) suggest that reductions in the time to result are limited by the instrument and not by the chemistry and that substantial improvements are still possible.",

The depth of multiplex achieved in PCR multiplexes for infectious disease has steadily increased from the earliest, manually performed multiplexes, compared to the those being developed for the automated systems of today. The point will soon be reached in which the feasible number of assays in a test begins to exceed the number of distinct pathogens that need to be tested for in any particular syndrome. However, there are situations (e.g., HIV drug resistance testing or HPV serotyping) where the ability to detect a limited number of point mutations would add great value to the test result.",
