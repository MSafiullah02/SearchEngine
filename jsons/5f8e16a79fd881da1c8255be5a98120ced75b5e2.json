Methods: Specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract of 195 CAP patients, viruses were measured by the Single-plex real-time PCR assay and the conventional culture method was exploited for bacteria. Results: Among the 195 patients, there were 46 (23.59%) pure bacterial infections, 20 (10.26%) yeast infections, 32 (16.41%) pure viral infections, 8 (4.10%) viral-yeast co-infections, and 17 (8.72%) viral-bacterial co-infections. The two most abundant bacteria were Acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas the most common virus was influenza A.

Currently, the ambiguous of etiology and lack of a microbiological diagnosis in CAP impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy [2] . In the last decade, the long-term implications of respiratory viral infection among susceptible hosts have increasingly been recognized [3] .

It is difficult to distinguish the cause of CAP induced by flu, other respiratory viruses or bacteria based solely on clinical symptoms, and the conventional lab biomarkers of viral and/or bacterial infections do not differ in influenza-positive compared with influenza-negative patients [6] . Influenza can temporarily suppress host immune defenses, leading to bacterial complications [7] . Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a frequent cause of excess mortality during influenza epidemics, but the epidemiology remains unclear [8] . Hospital admissions during the 2009 influenza epidemic season showed a moderate to strong association between influenza and bacterial pneumonia, whereas the interaction is modest or non-existent during nonepidemic periods [9] . Bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilia influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, often interact with respiratory viruses (esp. the influenza virus), and shape the outcome of respiratory infection [10] . Studies have shown the evidence of bacterial invasion is more than 90% in influenza-infected cases, and the high rates of co-infections exist in these patients, indicating that viral infection may enhance both susceptibility and severity of subsequent bacterial infection [8, 11, 12] . In vitro studies have shown that influenza infection enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia by about 100-fold in a week, but the interaction between influenza and bacteria is not limited in pneumococcal pneumonia [13] . In the hospital, viral testing among patients with respiratory symptoms is uncommon [14] , and the determination of the microbiological etiology is severely hampered in CAP by the difficulty of obtaining specimens from the infected area (esp. from lower respiratory tract), samples could be easily contaminated by respiratory conditioned pathogens.

Accurate and rapid etiologic diagnosis is crucial to pathogen-directed therapy. To date, the gold standard for CAP diagnosis is still based on the radiographic findings [22] . The radiological findings of multilobar infiltration or pleural effusion generally indicate greater severity [23] . Although etiological studies have been performed, current microbial diagnostic tests frequently do not allow clinicians to rule out bacterial infection with certainty [24] . Obtaining an qualified sample may be a challenge as specimens were easily contaminated by the bacteria located in upper airways [25] . For increasing the detection rate of pathogens, esp. for infection occurred in the lower respiratory tract, alveolar lavage fluid may be better in reflecting infectious status than the sputum. However, alveolar lavage fluids require semi-invasive surgery, which is certainly not routine in non-intubated patients, esp. to children [2] . Under this condition, taking sputum as the sample is more practical. Therefore, the relevant CAP guidelines recommend sputum examinations for patients with moderate to severe CAP. In this study, a high microbial yield can be achieved when real time PCR assays plus the conventional diagnostic methods, such as bacterial cultures [26, 27] .

Even there was a severe influenza outbreak during our study, other respiratory viral infections were more than influenza infection (63.16% vs. 36.84%). In all pathogens that cause CAP, bacteria occupied the majority of pathogens, and the most common bacterium was A. baumannii.

Most communityacquired cases of A. baumannii pneumonia are from tropical or subtropical countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In Thailand, severe CAP is caused by A. baumannii, and its mortality is 10 times higher than hospital-acquired A. baumannii pneumonia [33, 34] . In another aspect, most of our patients had underlying diseases, we could not exclude the possibility that patients had the bacterial infection in last hospital admission. The pathogen remains in the respiratory tract, causing clinical symptoms when the body's immunity is reduced. The outbreak of A. baumannii infection is also associated with multidrug resistance, and carbapenems have been considered to be a major factor in resistance to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infection [34] .
