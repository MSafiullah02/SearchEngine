In other words, we observe the times when each node gets infected by the contagion, but the edges of the network that gave rise to the diffusion remain unobservable. For example, we can often measure and observe the time when people decide to adopt a new behavior while we do not explicitly observe which neighbor in the social network influenced them to do so. In case of information diffusion, we often observe people (or media sites) talking about a new piece of information without explicitly observing the path it took in the information diffusion network to reach the particular node of interest. And, epidemiologists often observe when a person gets sick but usually cannot tell who infected her. In all these examples, one can observe the infection events themselves while not knowing over which edges of the network the contagions spread. Therefore, one of the fundamental research problems in the context of network diffusion is inferring the structure of networks over which various types of contagions spread [10] . Moreover, many times networks over which contagions diffuse are not static but change over time. Depending on the type of contagion, the time of the day, or death of the existing and birth of new nodes, the underlying network may dynamically change and shift over time.",

Some approaches infer only the network structure [10, 30] , while others infer not only the network structure but also the strength or the average latency of every edge in the network [9, 20] . However, to the best of our knowledge, previous work has always assumed networks to be static and contagion pathways to be constant over time. However, in most cases, networks are dynamic, and contagion pathways change over time, depending upon the contagions that propagate through them [22, 28] . For example, a blog can increase its popularity abruptly after one of its posts turns viral, this may create new edges in the information transmission network and so the content the blog produces in the future will likely spread to larger parts of the network. Similarly, at any given time a particular unexpected event may occur and a topic or piece of news may become very popular for a limited period of time. This again will lead to different emerging and vanishing information pathways, and thus to a time-varying underlying Model Edge (j, i) transmission likelihood f(t i |t j ; \u03b1 j,i ) network. In order to better understand these temporal changes, one needs to reconstruct the time-varying structure and underlying temporal dynamics of these networks and then study the information pathways of real-world events, topics or content.",

We assume there is an unobserved dynamic network that changes over time, while we observe the node infection times of many different contagions spreading over the edges of the network. The task then is to infer the edges and the dynamics of the underlying network. We develop an efficient on-line dynamic network inference algorithm, INFOPATH, that allows us to infer daily networks of information diffusion between online media sites over a one year period using more than 179 million different contagions diffusing over the underlying media network. We model diffusion processes as discrete networks of fully continuous temporal processes occurring at different rates building on our previous work [9, 11] . Our model allows information to propagate at different rates across different edges by adopting a datadriven approach, where only the recorded temporal diffusion events are used. The model considers the information which propagates through the network due only to diffusion, while ignoring any external sources [22] . However, our original diffusion model considered only static networks [9] . Here, we generalize the model and develop a new inference method to support dynamic networks. Our time-varying network inference algorithm, INFOPATH, uses stochastic gradient [26] to provide estimates of the time-varying structure and temporal dynamics of the inferred network. The framework enables us to study the temporal evolution of information pathways in the online media space.",

Perhaps surprisingly, the amount of mainstream media and blogs among the most influential nodes for most topics or news events are comparable.

Therefore, they consider the pathways over which information propagates to be time-invariant. The main contribution of this paper is to combine stochastic gradient and the diffusion model introduced in [9] to develop an efficient on-line network inference algorithm that provides time-varying estimates of the edges of a network and the transmission rates of each edge. This allows us to detect how information pathways emerge and vanish over time, and identify when nodes produce highly viral content.",

We pay attention to the rather general case of heterogeneous pairwise transmission rates, i.e., infections can occur at different transmission rates over different edges of the network. As \u03b1 j,i \u2192 0 the expected transmission time from node j to node i becomes arbitrarily long. In contrast with the original model [9] , we will later allow transmission rates \u03b1 j,i to change over time.

We allow information to only propagate forward in time, i.e., node j that has been infected at time t j may infect node i at time t i only if t j < t i , otherwise f (t i |t j , \u03b1 j,i ) = 0. The shape of the conditional likelihood of transmission may depend on the particular setting (information, influence, diseases, etc.) in which propagation takes place. In some scenarios, it may be possible to estimate a non-parametric likelihood while in others, expert knowledge may be used to decide upon a parametric model. For simplicity, we consider three well-known parametric models of edge transmission rates: exponential, power-law, and Rayleigh, defined in Table 1 . Exponential and power-law likelihoods have been used in modeling information propagation in social and information networks [9, 10, 11, 12, 20] , while Rayleigh has been used in previous work in disease spread in epidemiology [31] .

There are many possible sampling schemes. In practice, and for simplicity, we use windowed uniform sampling or windowed exponential sampling. Windowed means that when solving the network inference problem for time t, we only sample (uniformly or exponentially) cascades that have started in a sampling time window (t \u2212 T, T ). Here, we find an an important tradeoff. The shorter is the sampling time window T in the stochastic gradient descend, the quicker our algorithm is tracking changes in the edge transmission rates.

At any given time, there are many different real world events, topics, and content that propagates through the Web, leading to different emerging and vanishing information pathways, and thus an underlying time-varying network.

Figure 4 plots diffusion networks for three different 2011 world events: Fukushima nuclear disaster, UK royal wedding, and civil uprise in Syria. Each network is shown at three different time points. Red nodes represent mainstream media sites, and blue nodes represent blogs [16] . Based on the figure, we draw several interesting observations. Most often, information propagates through a core-periphery network structure. Such structure emerges by few central media sites and blogs driving the adoption of memes across the Web [10] . However, the network structure often changes dramatically over time, and we find clusters that emerge and vanish in short periods of time. For example, the information networks for Syria's uprise illustrated in Figures 4(g-h) , do not have any clear clustering structure. However, on December 2, 2011 (Figure 4 (i)) a cluster suddenly emerges in the network. Further investigation reveals that the cluster is composed of UK news sites and blogs that discuss recently implemented EU sanctions against Syria. Generally, it is common to observe sudden formation of clusters of sites from specific geographical areas. This is specially noticeable in the information network for Fukushima's disaster, in Figures 4(a-c) . Such clusters often form due to language boundaries, since such boundaries prevent memes to flow across countries or continents. Moreover, we often observe that such clusters are caused by a common external event [22] , like in the case of UK discussion on EU sanctions against Syria. Inferred dynamic networks can thus be used to investigate the flow of information as well as to detect external events that cause sudden perturbations to the diffusion network structure.",

Having studied the dynamics of edges in the network we now move towards investigating the network centrality of blogs and mainstream media sites over time for different topics and world events. To measure network centrality of node S in the network at time t, we first compute shortest path length from S to any other node R in the network. Then centrality of node S is defined as \u2211 R 1/d(S, R), where d(S, R) is the shortest path length from S to R (if R is not reachable from S then d(S, R) = \u221e). For networks with core-periphery structure, nodes with high centrality are typically located in the \"central\" core of the network. Figure 6 plots the percentage of blogs among the top 100 most central sites over time for eight different topics/events of 2011. Perhaps surprisingly, we observe there is a about the same number of mainstream media and blogs in the top-100 most central nodes for most networks -the number of blogs in the top-100 does not typically decreases below 30% or increases over 70%. For some topics, mainstream media are always more central (e.g., baseball and NBA in Figures 6(a, b) ). In contrast, for other topics, blogs dominate mainstream media over a significant amounts of time (e.g., Gaddafi in Fig. 6(c) ). Centrality of mainstream media and blogs can be relatively constant ( Fig. 6(a,b) ) or more time-varying ( Fig. 6(c,h) ). We find that a significant rise in the number of central blogs is often temporally correlated with an increasing social unrest (e.g., the Occupy Wall Street movement in Sept-Nov 2011 in Fig. 6(f) ).",

So far, we have used memes to trace the flow of information over the Web and have made several qualitative observations about the structure and dynamics of information pathways in online media. We now proceed and attempt to also quantitatively evaluate INFOPATH on real data. In case of real data the ground-truth information diffusion network is impossible to obtain. However, we can use the temporal dynamics of hyperlinks created between news sites as a proxy for real information flow. Thus, by observing the times when sites create hyperlinks, our goal is to infer the 'targets' of the links (i.e., infer the hyperlink network from the hyperlinks times). We proceed as follows. First, we discretize the time in days, we generate one network G * (t) per day t, in which we add an edge (u, v) if a document on a site u linked to a document on a site v within the last day. Then, we build a set of hyperlink cascades. A hyperlink cascade c h starts when a site publishes a piece of information and then other sites use hyper-links to refer to it. Since all our documents/posts are time stamped, we can trace the hyperlinks in the reverse direction and obtain information cascades. We extracted almost 0.5 million hyperlink cascades from 3.3 million websites from July 2011 till December 2012. Our aim is to use the hyperlink cascades to infer the time-varying network G * (t). We then evaluate how many edges INFOPATH estimates correctly by computing Accuracy, Precision and Recall for each day. Figure 7 shows Precision, Recall, and Accuracy over time for a time-varying hyperlink network with 11,461 nodes and 19,915 edges created over time, using 495,655 hyperlink cascades from July 2011 to December 2011.

We discovered that there is an early greater increase in information transfer among blogs than among mainstream media for news involving general population and social unrest, such as the Libyan civil war, Egyptian revolution, Syria's uprise and the Occupy Wall Street movement. Our work also opens various venues for future work. For example, rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence of our stochastic gradient descent method would provide further insights for its performance. Moreover, we notice that many times the changes in the inferred network structure could be attributed to sudden external real-world events. This opens two interesting questions. How can diffusion network inference be combined with methods for detecting external influence in networks [22] ? And also, how can dynamic network inference be extended for detecting unexpected real-world events based on a stream of documents? Last, many times not only information but also sentiment attached to a piece of information spreads through the network [19] . It would be interesting to think about inference of signed networks, where a positive/negative valence of an edge models sentiment relationship between a pair of nodes. Overall, such methods would allow us to improve our understanding of the current landscape of news coverage, the role that news media plays in framing the discussion of important topics, and the evolving ecosystem that news media occupies.
