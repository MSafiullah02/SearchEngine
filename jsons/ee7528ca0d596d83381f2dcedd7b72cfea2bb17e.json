            "text": "Influenza A virus (FLUAV), the causative agent of influenza infection, has received extensive attention due to the recent swine-origin H1N1 pandemic. FLUAV has long been the cause of annual epidemics as well as less frequent but more severe global pandemics. Here, we describe a biosensor utilizing electrically active magnetic (EAM) polyaniline-coated nanoparticles as the transducer in an electrochemical biosensor for rapidly identifying FLUAV strains based on receptor specificity, which will be useful to monitor animal influenza infections and to characterize pandemic potential of strains that have transmitted from animals to humans. Pandemic potential requires human-to-human transmissibility, which is dependent upon FLUAV hemagglutinin (HA) specificity for host glycan receptors. Avian FLUAV preferentially bind to \u03b12,3-linked receptors, while human FLUAV bind to \u03b12,6-linked receptors. EAM nanoparticles were prepared by synthesizing aniline monomer around gamma iron (III) oxide (\u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 ) cores, yielding 25-100-nm diameter nanoparticles that were structurally characterized by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The EAM nanoparticles were coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/04). Specificity of binding between glycans and H5 was demonstrated. The biosensor results were correlative to supporting data from a surface plasmon resonance assay that characterized HA/glycan binding and \u03b1-H5 antibody activity. This novel study applies EAM nanoparticles as the transducer in a specific, portable, easy-to-use biosensor with great potential for disease monitoring and biosecurity applications.",

The 2009 H1N1 pandemic originated from a swine FLUAV that has been circulating in pig herds for two decades and demonstrates how quickly a FLUAV with human-to-human transmissibility can spread worldwide [2] . Each strain of FLUAV is named and characterized by its hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) serotype [3] . The extent of infection into the host organism is determined by the viral surface glycoprotein HA, which mediates FLUAV host specificity and host cell entry [3] , [4] . Of the sixteen known HA and nine known NA serotypes, only three HA and two NA have adapted sufficiently to become pandemic in humans, resulting in the historical pandemics of H1N1 in 1918 and 2009, H2N2 in 1957, and H3N2 in 1968. All serotypes of FLUAV circulate in the avian population, leading to the common belief that birds act as the main reservoir for FLUAV [3] .",

In antigenic drift, the HA undergoes relatively minor changes that result from the selection of mutant viruses by antibodies generated against the prominent HA antigenic type currently circulating in the human population [6] . Of even greater concern are FLUAV pandemics, or global disease outbreaks, which are due to antigenic shifts and result in high mortality rates [6] , [7] . The most virulent of these was the 1918-1919 outbreak of H1N1, known as the \"Spanish flu,\" which resulted in 20-40 million deaths worldwide [8] . Pandemics occur when the genomic RNA segment encoding HA is replaced, allowing FLUAV strains to rapidly adapt from one animal species to another. FLUAV lends itself to such reassortment because the segmented nature of its genome allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains.",

            "text": "Conventional virological methods for influenza virus analysis are well established [10] . The \"gold standard\" for virus detection is viral isolation culture with immunocytological confirmation of viral antigen. Time to report including sample preparation and testing time is approximately 12-14 days. Other common virustesting procedures include complement fixation, hemagglutinininhibition, and polymerase chain reaction, which require several hours to one day for culture and detection. Commercial diagnostic test kits directly detect influenza A or B virus-associated antigens or enzyme in throat swabs, nasal swabs, or nasal washes. The majority of these tests use anti-influenza antibodies to detect viral antigens, with only a fraction differentiating between influenza A and B. Based on limited published data comparing performance of these commercial diagnostic test kits to conventional virological methods for detecting novel H1N1 virus in clinical specimens, sensitivity of commercial kits ranged from 10-70% [11] . Time to report is typically 30 min [10] . ZStat-Flu, manufactured by Zyme Tx, (Oklahoma City, OK) is an NA assay that achieves specificity using modified SA. The test has a specificity of 98.7% but a poor sensitivity of 62.2% as reported by the manufacturer [12] . While rapid test kits for FLUAV detection are commercially available, there is a need for a biosensor technology that decreases definitive turnaround time and offers quantitative results as opposed to subjective color change assessments. A biosensor is the integration of a biological component with an electronic, electrochemical, optical, or acoustic transducer, with the intention of quantifying a physiological or biochemical change in terms of an electrical response [13]- [21] . Descriptions of a wide range of biosensor types can be found in the literature. The conclusion to be drawn from currently available rapid assay techniques is a lack of binding partner novelty; most assays depend on detecting influenza viruses by interactions with influenza-specific antibodies. While the SA receptor has been investigated in NA binding, there lacks a biosensor technology that exploits influenza HA specificity for host SA receptors, which is the cornerstone of viral infectivity. The biosensor presented here is novel in its binding between SA receptors and influenza HA, which fills a gap in previous implementations and offers in-field characterization of influenza host range, which depends on SA specificity.",

            "text": "Conductive polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, polyacetylene, and polythiophene are receiving interest in current research applications due to their combined properties as both conductors of electricity and organic compounds. This combination means that conductive polymers can offer the mechanical flexibility and robustness of a plastic while also providing the electrical conductivity of a metal. Polyaniline is of particular interest for its environmental stability and simple and inexpensive synthesis. Undoped polyaniline is insulating, while the addition of a protic solvent such as hydrochloric acid (HCL) or sulfuric acid, which can release protons, yields a conducting form of polyaniline with an up to ten order of magnitude increase in conductivity [22] , [23] . Polyaniline is applicable in various platforms, including batteries, fuel cells, electrodes, and biosensors, largely due to its ability for efficient electronic charge transfer [24] [25] [26] [27] . Magnetic polyaniline nanoclusters have been described in the literature with various combinations of magnetic cores and doping agents. Magnetic core materials include iron (II, III) oxide, hydroxyl iron, and Li Ni Ferrite, with HCL, phosphoric acid, and toluene as doping agents [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . These nanostructures are attractive for their light weight, mechanical strength, and other magnetic properties [34] . The Biacore 3000 system utilizes surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure changes in mass at a biospecific surface that result from the interactions of interest. Biomolecular recognition elements recognize and capture analyte in a liquid sample producing a local increase in refractive index at a thin metal film surface. Optical means then accurately measure the refractive index increase that is proportional to the concentration of target in the sample [35] , [36] . The label-free, real-time system offers high sensitivity [37] . Schofield and Dimmock [38] first reported the use of SPR for influenza virus detection. The sensor chip was coated with anti-influenza monoclonal antibody, and influenza virus was injected into the flow system. Binding affinity with the surface antibody was monitored, and dissociation and association rate constants were comparable to those from an affinity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [38] . SPR has also been used to study the interaction between FLUAV HA and its cell surface receptor SA using a sensitive microscale binding assay [39] . Bromelain-cleaved HA rosettes showed tight binding to a fetuin-derivatized sensor surface. We report relevant results from an SPR (Biacore)-based assay, which studied the specificity and avidity of HA/glycan binding as an initial step in the design of a functional polymer-based biosensor.",

To our knowledge, such an application has not yet been reported. We propose a biosensor that utilizes EAM nanoparticles on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) platform. SPCEs are applicable for in situ monitoring and are attractive for their high sensitivity, portability, and affordability. Each strip consists of a carbon working electrode and silver reference electrodes printed on low-cost plastic (see Fig. 1 ). Screen printing offers reproducibility and reliability, and their single-use function offers on-site applicability [40] , [41] . This paper presents an efficient and valuable technique using a sequence of magnetic separation, direct electrical detection, and immunochemistry for development of a direct-charge transfer biosensor for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of FLUAV HA. Here, we investigate binding between purified HA recombinant from baculovirus and purified synthetic glycans with reported HA specificities, as proof-of-concept, on the biosensor platform.",

The scan range was chosen for the redox switching of polyaniline to be adequately observed and the scan rate was chosen for its intermediate value. Four consecutive 2-min scans were then recorded. The third scan was chosen for analysis based on previous experimentation that illustrated that the third scan produced the most pronounced current flow differences for different samples.

The order of binding is thus important. As seen in the SPR neutralization experiment, preincubation of \u03b1-H5 monoclonal antibody with H5, followed by glycan addition, prevents H5/glycan binding because the \u03b1-H5 monoclonal antibody binds within, or otherwise blocks, the glycan receptor binding domain on H5. When the H5 and glycan are allowed to interact first, subsequent addition of \u03b1-H5 monoclonal antibody did not displace the glycan. Rather, the \u03b1-H5 monoclonal was able to bind the H5 either outside of the receptor binding domain or in an available receptor binding domain on H5 trimer or aggregate, as we suspect this HA preparation is composed of large aggregates. This \u03b1-H5 monoclonal antibody is thus appropriate for use in both the SPR neutralization assay as well as the biosensor sandwich-type assay.",

At the same H5 concentration, 1.4 \u03bcM, \u0394Q remained consistent for glycan concentrations increasing from 100 to 500 \u03bcM (see Fig. 5 ). Figs. 5-7 show cyclic voltammograms of one replicate of each test for visual clarity, while the \u0394Q reflects the average of the replicates. This may indicate that H5 at 1.4 \u03bcM did not saturate the glycan receptors at the higher glycan concentration. Alternatively, this could suggest that the prepared SPCE surface or streptavidin surface density was saturated at the lower glycan concentration of 100 \u03bcM, and that further addition of glycan did not yield any more available sites for H5 to bind. Keeping the glycan concentration constant at either 100 or 500 \u03bcM and decreasing the H5 concentration from 1.4 to 290 nM reduced the \u0394Q to values near the negative control of no glycan and no H5. The samples with H5 at 290 nM were statistically similar for glycan at 100 and 500 \u03bcM, though statistically higher than the negative control (see Fig. 5 ). This could suggest that the glycan is the limiting reagent in terms of saturating the SPCE surface, but that when working with the glycan-saturated surface, the H5 becomes the limiting reagent. When the surface is saturated with glycans, the H5 concentration can be manipulated to obtain different readings. Interaction between the H5-specific glycan and H5 yielded a statistically higher \u0394Q when compared to the interaction between the nonbinder (not H5-specific) glycan and H5, at the same concentrations (see Fig. 6 ). This demonstrates that the biosensor system shows specificity of binding.",

In Fig. 7 , the negative control involved no glycan or H5 incubation steps, with only EAM-antibody complex incubation. The first blank included H5-specific glycan incubation, no H5 treatment, and EAM-antibody incubation. The second blank did not include glycan treatment, but included H5 and EAM-antibody incubation. The third blank included incubation with a nonbinder glycan, H5, and EAM-antibody. All negative controls and blanks were blocked with avidin and biotin after addition of glycan or, in the samples where no glycan was included, before addition of H5 or EAM-antibody. The absence of H5 yielded repeatable negative controls and blanks. Addition of H5 at 1.4 \u03bcM, in the presence of either no glycan or the nonbinder glycan, increased the \u0394Q. However, these increased levels did remain below the \u0394Q of the H5/H5-specific glycan binding. Because the presence of H5 in certain blanks resulted in higher \u0394Q values than in those blanks and negative controls without H5, we can conclude that there may be low levels of nonspecific binding between H5 and the SPCE. This may be to the SPCE itself or to any of the immobilized partners, including glutaraldehyde, AuNPs, or streptavidin. We are currently exploring alternative or additional blocking techniques and reagents to decrease nonspecific binding. The lowest dilution of H5 that produced a signal distinguishable from the negative control of no glycan and no H5 as well as the blanks consisting of no glycan or nonbinder glycan binding to H5 1.4 \u03bcM was taken as the sensitivity of detection. Because the glycan and H5 dilutions were limited by reagent availability, this sensitivity is not a conclusive analytical sensitivity, but the detection limit for the experimental concentrations tested here. H5 at 1.4 \u03bcM was taken as the detection limit. This detection limit may be improved by a reduction of the nonspecific binding between H5 1.4 \u03bcM and the SPCE as well as by an assessment of dilutions between H5 1.5 and 290 nM.",

The crystalline nature of the nanoparticles was studied by selected area electron diffraction using the JEOL 2200FS field emission TEM. Confirmation of polyaniline formation by TEM and FT-IR has been previously described in the literature and has not been repeated here [18] , [49] , [50] . As shown in Fig. 8(a) , the TEM and electron diffraction micrograph revealed EAM polyaniline nanoparticle sizes in the 25-100-nm range. As shown in the TEM image, the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 cores are the darkest circular spots and are surrounded by the gray lighter colored polyaniline that is polymerized around the cores. TEM imaging of the EAM polyaniline nanoparticles immunofunctionalized with \u03b1-H5 antibodies revealed a rougher edge to the dark circular EAM nanoparticles, which could represent the bound antibody [see Fig 8(b) ]. The synthetic glycan TEM revealed a structure characteristic of carbohydrate chains [see Fig. 9 (a)]. The characterization of the recombinant H5 revealed aggregates of sizes varying from 13-35 nm, seen as white circular spots [see Fig. 9(b) ]. This confirms our hypothesis that the H5 is in the form of large aggregates, since the influenza virion is approximately 100 nm in diameter and there are several hundred HA glycoproteins on the surface of each virion [6] , [7] . H5 of 13-35 nm can be concluded to be a large aggregate. This may provide another reason for nonspecific binding between this \"sticky\" H5 and the SPCE surface. TEM imaging of the glycan/H5/\u03b1-H5 monoclonal antibody complex revealed a cloudier boundary as compared to the glycan/H5 with no antibody added [see Fig. 10 (a) and (b)]. While the images do not offer definitive proof of antibody binding, the appearance of Fig. 10(a) does resemble the cloudy nature of the immunofunctionalized EAMs in Fig. 8(b) , which could indicate that antibody was bound in both samples. If so, Fig. 10(a) and (b) would confirm the SPR binding results presented in Fig. 4 .",
