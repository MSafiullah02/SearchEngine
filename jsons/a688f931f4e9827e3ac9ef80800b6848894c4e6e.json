Whereas RSV predominates in hospitalized infants aged <6 months with LRTIs, HRV is the most common virus detected in older infants and children admitted with wheezing illnesses, which are often recurrent and associated with a subsequent increased risk of asthma [20] [21] [22] 41 ]. In contrast, community-based studies like our own find symptomatic fVDEs with HRV occurring by age 4-6 months, and with RSV and other viruses appearing on average beyond this age [19, 38, 42] . Viruses such as RSV, PIV, INFV, and HMPV are more likely than other viruses to be associated with respiratory symptoms [9] and, consequently, although less commonly exposed to these viruses than HRV at a young age, it is thought that young infants hospitalized with more severe disease have preexisting smaller airways, have immature immune systems, and/or are lacking protective maternal antibodies [43, 44] . As these infants become older and their airways grow and immune systems mature, the symptoms of infections by these other viruses lessen [31, 38] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 125, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 390, "end": 394, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 395, "end": 399, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 400, "end": 404, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 590, "end": 594, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 595, "end": 598, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 599, "end": 602, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 724, "end": 727, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1013, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1157, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1161, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "While wheezing illnesses following early exposure to HRV are associated with a greater likelihood of developing asthma in high-risk cohorts [20] [21] [22] , the role of early asymptomatic HRV infections has received less attention. A recent report suggested that HRV detection in the first 4 weeks of life, even if asymptomatic, may help program immune memory with an exaggerated T-helper 2 (rather than T-helper 1) mucosal immune response and impaired antiviral responses [45] . This suggests a potential pathway for the later development of asthma and allergic sensitization in susceptible individuals. If true, interventions seeking to reduce HRV infections in high-risk infants will need to be introduced early. Although maternal vaccines to protect infants from early respiratory virus infections is an active area of research, especially for RSV and influenza viruses [32] , our study emphasizes the predominance of early HRV detections, the long-term effects of which remain uncertain in healthy infants. It also highlights that for many in our study population, their first infection from non-HRV viruses occurs at an age when maternal vaccines may no longer be protective [32] . The fVDEs by DNA viruses were significantly more likely than RNA viruses to have additional viruses codetected during this episode. In part, this might be explained by most HRV fVDEs occurring during the first 6 months of life where other viruses were detected uncommonly. When sole fVDEs by these DNA viruses were examined, they were found to be similar to HRV fVDEs in that about 50% of episodes were associated with symptoms, although symptomatic episodes with HPyV and HBoV-1 were significantly more prolonged than those associated with HRV. These findings indicate that, while common, these viruses often cause mild or no ARI symptoms, even after an fVDE [9, 46, 47] . Interestingly, HBoV-1 viral load was associated with the presence of ARI symptoms, a metric along with HBoV-1 capsid messenger RNA that has been reported previously to be associated with disease severity [47] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 144, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 145, "end": 149, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 150, "end": 154, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 874, "end": 878, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1185, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1851, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1855, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1859, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2070, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The ORChID cohort spanned multiple seasons, and its strengths include the comprehensive surveillance provided by regular weekly nasal swab collections and daily symptom diary recordings by parents. The return rate of 68% of expected swab is noteworthy given the project's intensive and prolonged nature. Potential limitations include parents missing very mild symptoms. However, we minimized reporting inaccuracy by training parents on symptom recognition and diary completion before they commenced the study and included only doctor-diagnosed episodes of otitis media and pneumonia [3] . This study design has been used successfully before where parents were trained to recognize respiratory symptoms [48] . Another limitation is parents having a suboptimal nasal swabbing technique [28] . However, sensitive molecular detection methods combined with mailed parent-collected nasal swabs provide comparable results with nasopharyngeal swabs collected by health professionals [27, 48, 49] . For logistical reasons, we did not include other respiratory viruses, such as INFV-C or PIV-4, in our assays, although 17 viruses still provide a comprehensive survey of early-life exposures. Additionally, 29% of HRV-positive specimens were unable to be typed, mainly due to low viral loads, a finding comparable with other community-based cohort studies [50] . We may have underestimated virus shedding duration because of missing swabs or swabs being collected only weekly. Similarly, ascribing symptoms to viruses when swab collection was not always done weekly or if other viruses were detected during the fVDE could compromise accuracy, although subanalyses of sole fVDEs were reassuring. It is also likely that we were unable to identify risk factors associated with symptomatic non-HRV fVDEs because of a lack of power, as numbers for some subcategories were small. As is common with cohort studies, our families were from more advantaged backgrounds, but our findings for infections rates, such as RSV, approximate recent studies [23, 37, 38] and provide an insight into respiratory viruses affecting infants from a developed country in a subtropical, urban setting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 583, "end": 586, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 702, "end": 706, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 784, "end": 788, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 980, "end": 983, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 984, "end": 987, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1349, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2032, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2036, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2040, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, respiratory viruses are detected early in life, with HRV playing a dominant role from birth.
