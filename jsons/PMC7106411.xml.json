To clarify the relation, they studied acute and convalescent sera of patients involved in a pneumonia outbreak in a small town in New York and found that influenza B pre-existed in the community. They concluded that some localised outbreaks of acute bacterial pneumonia were secondary manifestations of influenza epidemics and that an increased prevalence of pneumonia may be a useful clue to identifying and studying outbreaks of influenza.",

Both nasopharyngeal carriage and systemic infections with N meningitidis were significantly associated with serological evidence of recent influenza infections (p=0\u00b7054 and p=0\u00b7029, respectively). In 1976, Mackowiak and colleagues69 reported four cases of meningococcaemia that occurred simultaneously in a family of six. The family members were affected by influenza-like illnesses before the outbreak of meningococcemia.69 In 1986, Schubiger and colleagues70 reported an outbreak of group B meningococcal disease among boarding school students. Each affected student had serological evidence of concomitant influenza infection. The authors concluded that \u201cthe viral infection made way for the outbreak of the meningococcal disease and for the high rate of secondary meningococcal infection\u201d. In February 1986, within 2 days, five children who rode the same school bus developed group C meningococcal disease. All of the affected children had recent influenza-like illnesses, and cases had higher titres of antibodies to influenza B than non-affected students on the same bus.71 In January 1996, ten cases of group C meningococcal disease occurred within 6 days among 1034 air force recruits in Greece.

During the same period, rates of meningococcal disease were increased and case fatality rates were exceptionally high throughout southwest England.73 In 1957 and 1976, in England and Wales, approximately 2 weeks separated large outbreaks of influenza A from increases in reports of meningococcal meningitis.74 From 1985 through 1990 in France, the incidence of meningococcal disease during a given week correlated with rates of influenza-like syndrome during the preceding (but not the following) 5 weeks. Also, there were significant spatiotemporal associations between the spread of influenza-like syndrome throughout the country and subsequent increases in meningococcal disease rates (p<0\u00b705).
