The phagemid production, panning, and screening were essentially the same as those reported by Krebber et al. [12] in 1997. In brief, the phagemids were rescued by superinfection with helper phage VCS M13 (Stratagene) and then were subjected to panning on PA, LF, and EF proteins coated on ELISA wells. Nonspecifically adsorbed phages were removed by extensive washing. Specifically bound phages were eluted with 100 mmol/L triethylamine, neutralized in pH, and amplified. After 3 rounds of panning, randomly chosen single-phage scFv clones were screened for specific binding by phage ELISA [13]. Clones that differentially bound to specific antigens with values of >1.0 for absorbance measured at 450 nm (A450) were considered to have a positive result, whereas A450 values of <0.2 were considered to denote a negative result. For clones that bound specifically to PA, LF, or EF, the variable regions of VH and light (VL)\u2013chain genes were sequenced, and their corresponding amino acid sequences were aligned",

Experiments were conducted in 2 configurations. First, antibodies were immobilized to the surface, and the kinetics of binding and dissociation of PA were recorded for 10 min and 2 h, respectively, at PA concentrations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nmol/L. To eliminate the effects of immobilization-induced surface-site heterogeneity and mass transport limitation in the determination of the binding constants [18], the kinetic traces were globally fitted with a model for continuous ligand distributions [19] combined with a 2-compartment approximation of mass transport. Second, we conducted solution competition experiments in which different concentrations of soluble Fab were preincubated with PA for 24 h and the concentration of unbound PA was determined from the initial slope of surface binding noted when the mixture was passed over the antibody-functionalized surface. Standard competition isotherms were used for analysis [17, 18]",

PBS was mixed with PA in control samples. The mixture was added to the cells and was incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. The medium was removed, and cells were washed 5 times with ice-cold PBS, followed by lysis in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in PBS) plus EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of protein (as measured with BCA; Pierce Biotechnology) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-PA polyclonal antibody 5308 (dilution, 1:3500), which was developed in our laboratory (Bacterial Toxins and Therapeutics Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), and HRP-conjugated goat anti\u2013rabbit IgG secondary antibody (dilution, 1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotech)",

Ninety percent of the clones recognized PA or LF proteins but not BSA control protein. Four unique anti-PA and 2 unique anti-LF scFv phagemid clones were identified (W1, W2, A63-6, W5, F3-6, and F5-1) by sequence analysis (figure 1). Two clones, W1 and W2, had very similar sequences in the VH and V\u03ba regions (figure 1), with only a 9-aa difference (3 of the amino acids are located within the primer region). The amino acid sequences of the other 4 clones differed greatly. As expected, the greatest divergences in sequence and length were noted in the CDR regions. Because there is extensive homology between chimpanzee and human immunoglobulins [8], similarity searches of all known human immunoglobulin genes in the V-BASE database were conducted [25]. The VH3 family of VH and the V\u03ba I and II families of V\u03ba were preferentially used by anti-anthrax antibodies (table 1). As expected, W1 and W2 clones were derived from the same VH and V\u03ba germline genes",

Therefore, only W2 was used to map the neutralization epitope. In ELISA, competition was also observed between 14B7 and W2 but not between 2D3 and W2 (figure 4). 14B7 binds to the site responsible for binding to the cellular receptor, whereas 2D3 does not compete with 14B7 and binds to a distinct binding site [16]. The binding site for W2 was mapped by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. The smallest peptide that reacted with W2 antibody contained 121 aa, corresponding to aa 614\u2013735 at the C-terminus of PA (figure 5). This result indicated that W2 bound to a conformational epitope that encompassed almost the entire domain 4 of PA [28]. Because domain 4 of PA is responsible for cellular receptor binding [29, 30], the results suggested that W2 neutralizes the toxin by blocking binding of PA to the cellular receptor. This conclusion was confirmed in a binding assay, by use of Western blot analysis, which showed that W2 prevented the binding of PA to RAW264.7 cells (figure 6). The affinity (Kd) of binding of PA to the receptor is 1\u00d710-9 mol/L to 5\u00d710-9 mol/L [31]. Therefore, the affinity of W2 antibody binding to PA is 20\u2013100-fold higher than the affinity of PA for the cellular receptor",

So far, 3 neutralization epitopes in PA have been proposed: the site for binding to the cellular receptor, the site for binding to LF [16, 37], and the site for heptamer formation [37]. However, the locations of these putative epitopes have not been precisely defined. For example, the epitope recognized by murine MAb 14B7 was suggested to be between Asp-671 and Ile-721, on the basis of the differential binding of 14B7 to different PA fragments generated through C-terminal deletions [16]. Because N-terminally deleted PA fragments were not tested, the epitope mapping for 14B7 could be incomplete. The previous observation that a PA fragment corresponding to aa 624\u2013735 did not compete with PA for binding to the cell receptor [38] suggests that the region between aa 624 and aa 735 was not sufficient to generate the receptor recognition site. Some of the residues in domain 4 of PA that are critical for binding to the cellular receptor and to anti-PA 14B7 MAb have been determined by alanine-scanning mutations [39]",

Although production of an efficient anthrax vaccine is an ultimate goal, the benefits of vaccination can be expected only if a large proportion of the population at risk is immunized. The low incidence of anthrax suggests that large-scale vaccination may not be the most efficient means of controlling this disease. In contrast, passive administration of neutralizing human or chimpanzee MAb to a subject at risk for anthrax or exposed to anthrax could provide immediate efficacy for emergency prophylaxis against or treatment of anthrax. This finding is supported by a recent study [27], which indicated that passive immunization with affinity-improved, humanized murine MAb 14B7 against PA (ETI-204) could efficiently protect rabbits before or after challenge with aerosolized Bacillus anthracis spores. However, humanized murine MAbs may retain some antigenic components of the original murine sequences and may elicit antibodies to the MAb in humans. Human- and chimpanzee-derived MAbs would not be expected to have this problem, because the sequences of chimpanzee immunoglobulin genes are virtually identical to those of humans [8\u201310\n, 40]. Furthermore, one would expect that the anti-PA chimpanzee MAbs W1 and W2 will provide better protection than will ETI-204, because these MAbs had higher affinity (Kd) and lower EC50 in in vitro neutralization experiments than did ETI-204",
