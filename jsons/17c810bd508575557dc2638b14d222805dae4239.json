Two organ complications in particular, pulmonary and hepatic, have been a major focus of investigation over the past several decades.

Determination of the severity of respiratory dysfunction, including an assessment of the need for supplemental oxygen support, overall fl uid balance, renal function, and cardiac output should be followed by radiographic imaging. In general, an initial chest x-ray or CT scan will identify the presence of lobar, multilobar, or diffuse pulmonary infi ltrates ( Fig. 5.1 ). While such fi ndings may impact the decision-making process, they are nondiagnostic in and of themselves. In the absence of obvious cardiac failure or iatrogenic fl uid overload, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be considered when infi ltrates are present. BAL samples should be sent for a number of diagnostic tests to determine the potential presence of community or hospital acquired and opportunistic infections. Besides bacterial, fungal, and cytological stains, quantitative cultures should be performed on BAL fl uid for diagnostic purposes. In addition, direct fl uorescent antibody stains, centrifugation cultures (shell vial), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays may also be very useful in isolating/identifying various viral pathogens. The role of BAL in HCT recipients remains a matter of debate, with the diagnostic yield ranging from 31 to 67 % in various reports (Huaringa et al. 2000 ) . In many cases, patients are referred for BAL after several days of symptoms and only after empiric antibiotic therapy has been well established. Empiric antibiotic management has been reported to provide inadequate coverage in over 40 % of patients with pathogens identifi ed on subsequent BAL (Ascioglu et al. 2002 ; Prasoon et al. 2004 ). Furthermore, prolonged empiric antibiotics may diminish growth of potential pathogens, limiting the subsequent utility of bronchoscopic procedures. In a retrospective study of 598 patients who underwent BAL within the fi rst 100 days post-HCT at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the overall yield of BAL was 55 %, with the yield 2.5 times greater among patients in whom a BAL was performed within the initial 4 days of clinical presentation. In addition, pneumonia-associated deaths were three times higher (18 % vs. 6 %) in those patients undergoing late bronchoscopy, following 4 days of clinical symptoms (Shannon et al. 2010 ). Yanik and colleagues examined 444 bronchoscopy procedures completed on 300 patients who received HCT at the University of Michigan from 2001 to 2007 (Yanik et al. 2008a ) . Only 13 % of BAL specimens collected in the fi rst 30 days of HCT were positive for infection, with the diagnostic yield increasing to 33 % between days 31 and 100. Hence, while the majority of HCT patients requiring BAL within the fi rst 100 days may be categorized as having idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), a signifi cant number of individuals will have evi-dence for infection.

Fungi rarely cause acute infections in the immunocompetent host. Candida species, for example, are commensal fl ora of the nasopharyngeal tract and skin, rarely causing lower respiratory tract invasion in the immunocompromised host. Candidal infections and candidemia are commonly seen when breakdowns in epithelial and mucosal barriers occur in conjunction with concurrent use of empiric antibacterial agents that eradicate normal bacterial fl ora. Tissue cultures are required to establish the diagnosis of invasive Candida , with both bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum cultures poor predictors of invasive pulmonary candidal infections. In contrast, invasive fungal infections from pathogenic molds are a common cause of pneumonia in the posttransplant setting, with invasive Aspergillus infections occurring in 10-15 % of allogeneic transplant recipients. Aspergillus pneumonia has been reported at a median 92 days posttransplant, and overall survival from invasive Aspergillus has been reported at less than 30 % (Grow et al. 2002 ) . Risk factors for the development of Aspergillus pneumonia include prolonged corticosteroid usage (\u22651 mg/kg/day), history of recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and prolonged neutropenia (Grow et al. 2002 ; Garcia-Vidal et al. 2008 ) . The combination of neutropenia, impaired T-cell function, and abnormal glucose metabolism is an additive risk for invasive fungi. Defi nitions of invasive fungi were established in 2002 to distinguish colonization from actual infection. Invasive fungal infections are now classifi ed as proven, probable, or possible. Proven infections require histologic confi rmation or a positive tissue culture. Probable infections require both a host factor and clinical and/or fl uid cultures consistent with an invasive fungus (De Pauw et al. 2008 ) . Currently available tests for the serum fungal markers betaglucan and galactomannan could also be useful to differentiate colonization from invasive infections with Candida and aspergillus species, respectively. Radiographic features of invasive fungi are heterogenous, with small and large nodules, ground-glass opacifi cations, cavitary lesions, treein-bud appearance, and halo signs can be observed on chest radiograph or computed tomography (CT). Treatment of invasive fungi makes use of the unique biology of the organism. Fungi contain a cell membrane with ergosterol and a cell wall with beta-glucan, both targets for antifungal therapy. Voriconazole provides effective therapy for a wide range of pathogenic fungi, excluding Mucor species. Both posaconazole and lipid formulations of amphotericin B provide coverage for Mucor , in addition to coverage for Aspergillus and Candida species. The clinician initiating voriconazole or other antifungal \"azole\" therapy should be mindful of its impact on cytochrome p450-dependent drugs, including the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and cyclosporine and the mTor inhibitor sirolimus.

Epithelial apoptosis is usually attributed to T-cell-mediated injury and is considered pathognomonic for acute GVHD. Although identifi ed in the lungs of many patients with IPS (Yousem 1995 ; Beschorner et al. 1978 ) , epithelial apoptosis has not been consistently observed in allogeneic HCT recipients with lung dysfunction. Based upon murine models, the pathogenesis of IPS appears to be a complex interplay between soluble infl ammatory mediators (Th1 cytokines, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), infl ammatory chemokines), donor-derived effector T cells, accessory cells (myeloid, pulmonary macrophages), and resident epithelial and endothelial cells. Signifi cant increases in the total number of lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar space (Cooke et al. 1996 ) , increased vascular permeability, plus elevated levels of TNF\u03b1 and infl ammatory cytokines have been noted in the lung tissue and BAL fl uid in both murine models and from clinical samples from patients with IPS (Clark et al. 1998 ; Shankar and Cohen 2001 ; Cooke et al. 1996 Cooke et al. , 2000b Piguet et al. 1989a ) . A direct role for TNF\u03b1 in the development of IPS has been established using strategies that either neutralize its effects (Piguet et al. 1987 ; Cooke et al. 2000b ) or use TNF\u03b1-defi cient mice as HCT donors (Cooke et al. 2000a ; Hildebrandt et al. 2004 ). Administration of rhTNFR-Fc, a soluble, dimeric, TNF-binding protein at the time of endotoxin challenge in mice, effectively prevents IPSassociated lung injury in this setting (Cooke et al. 2000b ) . Studies using genetically altered mice have shown that IPS is dependent upon donorderived, rather than host-derived, TNF\u03b1.

High-dose corticosteroid therapy (>2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone equivalent) has not been shown to improve outcome when compared to lower doses of corticosteroids (\u22642 mg/kg/day) (Fukuda et al. 2003 ) . More recently, the role for TNF inhibition in the management of IPS has been under investigation. A pilot study from the University of Michigan examined the use of a soluble TNF-binding agent, etanercept, in the treatment of patients who met the diagnostic criteria for IPS. A 4-week course of therapy was given, with a strict defi nition used to defi ne response (complete cessation of all oxygen support within 28 days of therapy onset). Responses were noted in ten (67 %) subjects, with survival 73 % within the therapy period (Fukuda et al. 2003 ; Yanik et al. 2008b ) .

The clinical course is highly variable, ranging from a gradual decline in lung function over years to a rapid deterioration over several months. The incidence of BOS has varied from 2 to 25 % following allogeneic HCT, the wide range likely refl ecting the nonuniform diagnostic criteria used to defi ne the condition (Afessa et al. 2001 ; Williams et al. 2009 ). The disorder is associated with airfl ow obstruction on pulmonary function testing (PFT) with declines in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio required for diagnostic purposes. In early stages, BOS is characterized by small airway infl ammation with lymphocytic bronchitis, ultimately progressing to fi brinous obliteration of bronchiolar lumen (Schwarer et al. 1992 ; Urbanski et al. 1987 ; Cooke and Yanik 2009 ). Respiratory symptoms include cough, dyspnea, and wheezing, but many patients remain asymptomatic despite showing signs of moderate to severe airway obstruction on PFTs (Clark et al. 1987 ; Holland et al. 1988 ). Chest radiographs are most often normal except for signs of hyperinfl ation (Curtis et al. 1995 ; Holland et al. 1988 ; Schwarer et al. 1992 ) .

In contrast to BOS, in which bronchiolar damage predominates, BOOP is primarily an alveolar disorder. The disorder is characterized by extensive infi ltration of granulation tissue within alveoli, with fi broblasts and a matrix of loose connective tissue deposits. The patho-physiology is poorly understood, though a strong association with acute and/or chronic GVHD (Freudenberger et al. 2003 ; Jinta et al. 2007 ), a possible link to HLA B35 (Yotsumoto et al. 2007 ) , and decreased incidence following T-celldepleted HCT (Ditschkowski et al. 2007 ) are all supportive of an alloimmune mechanism. To avoid confusion with BOS, the disorder has been renamed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) in the pulmonary community.

As shown in Figure 5 .4 , exposure of SEC's to conditioning radiation or toxic metabo-lites of chemotherapy leads to SEC injury and activation. Activated SECs express cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) and adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) resulting in activation of proinfl ammatory pathways that further damage the endothelium (Coppell et al. 2003 ) . This leads to the loss of endothelial wall fenestrae and formation of gaps between SECs (Panel B) (Carreras 2012 ) . Consequently, red blood cells, leukocytes, and cellular debris extravasate into the space of Disse, causing progressive extraluminal compressive narrowing of the sinusoids (Carreras 2012 ; Coppell et al. 2003 ; Bearman 1995 ) and dissection of the endothelial cells, which could further embolize downstream and occlude the sinusoid (Panel C) (Carreras 2012 ). In addition, injury to the SECs of the sinusoids is also associated with a procoagulant and hypofi brinolytic state that contributes further to fi brin deposition, clot formation in situ, and narrowing of the sinusoids (Guglielmelli et al. 2012 ; Coppell et al. 2003 ; Bearman 1995 ) .

The Seattle criteria require at least two or more clinical features including jaundice, painful hepatomegaly or ascites, and/or unexplained weight gain within 30 days of transplantation (Bearman 1995 ; ). The Baltimore criteria specify an elevated bilirubin level of at least 2.0 mg/dL and two or more of the following characteristics: hepatomegaly, ascites, or at least 5 % weight gain by day +21 post-HCT, with the Baltimore criteria validated according to both histopathologic features as well as outcome (Bearman 1995 ; Jones et al. 1987 ) . VOD/SOS presents with a wide clinical spectrum and is conventionally divided into mild, moderate, and severe disease (McDonald et al. 1993 ) . Mild VOD/SOS is considered disease that meets diagnostic criteria, does not require specifi c treatment for fl uid excess or medication for hepatic pain, and has a self-limiting course. Moderate VOD/SOS reveals evidence of liver injury with need for active treatment for fl uid excess or medication for hepatic pain but usually resolves completely. Severe VOD/SOS is defi ned in association with MOF and severe hyperbilirubinemia with rapid weight gain and has very high mortality rate (DeLeve et al. 2009 ). Although several biomarkers of endothelial injury have been described in the literature, including plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) (Nurnberger et al. 1998 ; Salat et al. 1994 ) , no laboratory marker has been validated as a diagnostic marker of VOD/SOS. From retrospective analyses, the presence of multiorgan failure has emerged as the most useful marker for VOD/SOS severity to date. The Bearman model, developed in the 1990s, estimates the risk of developing severe VOD/SOS based on bilirubin level, percentage weight gain, and a designated time frame from HCT; this model has demonstrated some utility for predicting VOD/SOS severity. However, as the Bearman model was developed in a cohort of patients who developed VOD/SOS within 17 days of HCT after specifi c conditioning regimens, its general applicability to other conditioning regimens and later time frames post-HCT is limited Coppell et al. 2010 ; Bearman et al. 1993 ) . In this context, sensitive and specifi c biomarker assays are needed that could guide disease prognostication and management, with some candidate markers under study but none yet defi ned. (Richardson et al. 1998 ) . A number of The promising results observed with DF in VOD/SOS treatment trials have led to investigation of its use as prophylaxis for VOD/SOS following HCT. A number of prospective historically controlled trials have reported benefi ts with DF prophylaxis in pediatric patients at high risk of developing VOD/SOS (Cappelli et al. 2009 ; Corbacioglu et al. 2006 ; Qureshi et al. 2008 ). These studies are also supported by the recent prospective multicenter phase II/III study in Europe . In this trial, 360 children (<18 years) who were undergoing myelo-ablative HCT were randomized to receive either prophylactic DF from conditioning to 30 days post-HCT or no prophylaxis (as a control group). In an intent-to-treat analysis, there was a 40 % reduction in VOD/SOS by day 30 post-HCT in patients receiving prophylactic DF when compared with control (12 % vs. 20 %; p = 0.051). Of note, the mortality at 100 days was four times higher in patients who developed VOD/SOS compared to those without VOD/SOS (25 % vs. 6 %; p < 0.0001). Interestingly enough, the incidence of acute GVHD was also signifi cantly lower in the DF prophylaxis arm, an observation consistent with similar fi ndings in treatment studies ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 173, "text": "Jones et al. 1987 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 174, "end": 196, "text": "Richardson et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 386, "end": 401, "text": "(Bearman 1995 ;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 708, "end": 723, "text": "(Bearman 1995 ;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 724, "end": 743, "text": "Jones et al. 1987 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 863, "end": 886, "text": "(McDonald et al. 1993 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1394, "text": "(DeLeve et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1569, "text": "(Nurnberger et al. 1998 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1589, "text": "Salat et al. 1994 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 2302, "end": 2323, "text": "Coppell et al. 2010 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2324, "end": 2345, "text": "Bearman et al. 1993 )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2562, "text": "(Richardson et al. 1998 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 2879, "end": 2902, "text": "(Cappelli et al. 2009 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2903, "end": 2928, "text": "Corbacioglu et al. 2006 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2929, "end": 2948, "text": "Qureshi et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnosis and Prognosis of VOD/SOS"}, {"text": "Despite the promising results from clinical trials with DF as treatment and prevention of VOD/SOS, day 100 mortality from VOD/SOS remains unacceptably high. The importance of early intervention is key, with recent clinical observations indicating that delays in the initiation of VOD/SOS treatment are associated with worse outcomes (Richardson et al. 2011 ) . The role of DF in VOD/SOS management may, in fact, be optimized with its use in early disease or as prophylaxis. Additional prospective studies in VOD/SOS prevention are now planned in adult HCT populations and specifi c high-risk settings. Elevations of von Willebrand factor, thrombomodulin, E-selectin, and soluble ICAM-1 before and early after allogeneic transplantation may be useful in predicting VOD/SOS in patients receiving sirolimus (Cutler et al. 2010 ) as GVHD prophylaxis and could lead to preemptive treatment or prevention trials based on these and other biomarkers . Finally, additional therapies, such as low molecular weight heparin, N-acetyl cysteine, antithrombin III, and other novel antithrombotics may warrant further investigation in combination with DF Ho et

The use of tissue plasminogen activator with or without heparin has been evaluated in a number of studies. However, results have generally been disappointing. Approximately one-third of patients show response to thrombolytic therapy, although severe hemorrhages are common with therapy and can be life threatening with no survival advantage apparent (DeLeve et al. 2009 ) (Table 5.4 ).Although there are no agents to date approved for the treatment of VOD/SOS either in the USA or Europe, the investigational drug defi brotide (DF) has shown the most promising results in clinical trials to date. DF has now been used in more than 1,800 patients worldwide and has demonstrated signifi cant safety and tolerability, with low rates of drug-related hemorrhage (ref Gentium Announces Submission of a Marketing Authorization Application for Defi brotide to the European Medicines Agency, 2011 ). DF is a polydisperse oligonucleotide with fi brinolytic properties (but no signifi cant systemic anticoagulation) and has shown protective effects on micro-and macrovascular endothelium. The use of DF for the treatment of VOD/SOS is supported by a number of large clinical trials showing that DF improves both complete response (CR) and survival, with a recent multicenter randomized phase II study establishing an effective DF dose of 25 mg/kg/day, given in divided doses intravenously every 6 hours (Table 5.5 ).The effi cacy of DF for the treatment of VOD/ SOS was initially demonstrated in a retrospective study of 19 patients with VOD/SOS plus MOF, showing complete resolution of VOD/SOS in eight patients (42 %), six of whom survived for longer than 100 days with no signifi cant bleeding observed", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "4 t-PA with or without heparin for the treatment of VOD", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td> Author </td><td> No. of patients </td><td> Dose (mg/ day) </td><td> Duration ( d ) </td><td> Heparin (yes/no) </td><td> No. of responses </td><td> Life-threatening hemorrhage </td></tr><tr><td> Baglin et al.
