This ease of accessibility combined with poor consumer knowledge was considered one of the most important contributors to the increasing prevalence of AMR. The development and implementation of more effective infection prevention and control strategies was identified as a priority, particularly in healthcare. Three major concerns related to the perception that many patients admitted to hospital already have AMR infections, that staff prescribing behaviors are not ideal, and that the lack of resources to develop and implement AMS programs is an important barrier to decreasing the overuse of antibiotics.",

E-test antifungal tests showed that all Candida rugosa strains were susceptible-dose dependent towards voriconazole and resistant to fluconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin based on Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. Highest biomass was observed in one of the C. rugosa strains, followed by C. pararugosa at 12 hours of incubation. However, highest bioactivity was observed in the ATCC at 24 hours, followed by C. pararugosa at 48 hours and the same C. rugosa train at 24 hours. Virulence was also contributed by secretion of protease enzymes by all the clinical strains. None of the C. rugosa and C. pararugosa trains showed any phospholipase activity. Conclusions C. rugosa and C. pararugosa clinical isolates should be considered pathogenic species because of their resistance against commonly used antifungal drugs and their contributing virulence factors. In response to an antimicrobial resistance \"apocalypse\" The Medical City, a private tertiary hospital in the Philippines, conducts microbiologic surveillance and has an existing \"prior approval of restricted antibiotics\" wherein release of identified broad spectrum antibiotics were done only upon approval of ID consultants. In June 2015, a second tier of ASP was introduced. The \"drug duration, audit and feedback\" (DDAF) program monitors and audits the duration of empiric antibiotics prescribed by clinicians. Sticker reminders are being placed on the chart on day 3 as a reminder to de-escalate and on day 10 as a reminder to consider stopping the antibiotics. This study aimed to present a comparative study of the antimicrobial resistance of the top 3 bacteriologic agents from respiratory isolates in a tertiary care hospital in the Philippines, from January to June 2015 versus January to June 2016, as a surrogate marker to the success of the second tier of ASP recently introduced Materials and methods Most prevalent organisms from sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage were determined through laboratory surveillance comparing their resistance pattern from January to June 2015 versus January to June 2016.",

Background Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) infections are an emerging threat in specific regions of South East Asia, Europe, and the United States. CPE occurs sporadically in Australia with isolated genomic clusters. Different classes of carbapenemases are prevalent by region worldwide, and in Australia, imipenemase-producing CPE (bla IMP-4) is endemic at low levels. In our healthcare facility, carbapenemases other than IMP demonstrate epidemiological links to recent overseas healthcare or residency. Following retrospective recognition of a cluster of CPE cases linked to a single healthcare facility in Melbourne, the local health authority, the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, released comprehensive consensus guidelines for the management of CPE in December 2015.",

Background Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common hospital acquired infection at obstetrics and gynecology hospital. SSI prolonged hospital stay and increased treatment costs. We aimed to identify incidence and causative organism of surgical site infection among cesarean section and gynecology surgery cases. Materials and methods A prospective cohort study was conducted at Hung Vuong Hospital, Viet Nam from January 2015 to May 2016. Women who underwent caesarean and gynecological surgery were included in the study. CDC criteria (2009) were used to diagnose SSI. Results 29,681 women underwent caesarean and gynecological surgery. SSI rate was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.98 -1.22%), in which 0.96% SSI after caesarean section (95% CI: 0.84 -1.08%) and 1.7% SSI after gynecological surgery (6.26% SSI after hysterectomy with 95% CI: 4.91 -7.79%).

The impact of AMS on prescribing practices of physicians, antibiotic utilization and rates of multiple drug resistant organisms (MDROs) were evaluated. Materials and methods From 2011 to 2013, a multi-disciplinary AMS team initiated educational campaigns, developed AMS policies and antimicrobial guidelines based on the local antibiogram. Pilot implementation of policies was conducted in 2014 to 2016. Outcome measures included compliance rate of physicians to the surgical prophylaxis guideline, utilization of carbapenems and vancomycin in defined daily doses (DDDs per 100 patient-days) and rates of multi-drug resistant organisms. Results The utilization of carbapenems was 47.48, and 31.72 DDDs/100 patient days in 2014 and 2015, respectively (33% reduction). The utilization of vancomycin increased from 3.76 DDDs/100 patient-days in 2014 to 4.93 DDDs/100 patient-days in 2015. There was increased compliance to timing of surgical prophylaxis from 53% in 2014 to 89% in 2016. The proportion of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) decreased from 60% in 2013 to 47% in 2015. The proportion of Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae decreased from 12% in 2013 to 10% in 2015, whereas proportion of ESBL-producing E. coli increased from 11% in 2013, to 20% in 2014, and 23% in 2015. The proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae was 16% in 2013, 23% in 2014, and 16% in 2015. Conclusions The AMS program resulted in increased compliance to the surgical prophylaxis policy, decreased utilization of carbapenems, and decreased proportion of MRSA, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. There is a room for improvement in reduction vancomycin use in this setting.

In the late of year 2014, after the decreasing rates of PC-SSI in Songklanagarind Hospital from vigorous control measures, we decided to change the antibiotic prophylaxis from fosfomycin (FOS) to cefazolin (CZO). This study aimed to evaluate the trend of PC-SSIs after changing antibiotic prophylaxis. Materials and methods The surveillance data were reviewed together with patient medical records to access the trend of PC-SSIs and identify the factors needed for risk adjustment. Results Information of 3250 craniotomies or craniectomies were reviewed and 157 PC-SSIs were documented in the patients underwent the operations during January 2005 through June 2016. Since the late of year 2007, FOS prophylaxis were used more frequently due to the recognition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus outbreak. After the downward trend of PC-SSIs began in year 2012, prophylaxis was changed from FOS to CZO and the trend of PC-SSIs did not change after that. Conclusions Changing surgical prophylaxis from FOS to CZO did not increase the risk of PC-SSI.",

We assumed conservatively that each sick leave day cost the hospital 468.00 pesos.ConclusionsAnnual influenza vaccination incurs at most a net cost of 77 centavos or 770 pesos for the current workforce of 1,000 staff members. This is a cost beneficial intervention which must be continued. For this reason, in 2016, the team used the quadrivalent vaccine which cost 650 pesos. This will determine the cost benefit ratio of this enhanced program in 2017.Session: Occupational Health/VaccineO6 Cost implications and control of adult varicella among healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital in Manila Doctors Hospital, Philippines Aisa Jensen Lee, Melecia A.

Results 1363 cases were included in the PPS. Average age was 11 months (median 3 months). Major reasons for admission were infection 66%. Admission source was other hospital 49.3%, current hospital 36.5%. Intubation 47.8%, CVC 29.4%, PVC 86.2%. HAI prevalence was 33.1%, of these 2 HAI in 9.9% and 3 HAI in 1.3%. Intubation had a significant (p < 0.001) correlation with HAI. The most common diagnosis was pneumonia 52.2%, sepsis 26.4%, the SSI and NE 9 cases (2%) each. Positive laboratory findings were 212 (43%). Carbapenem resistance were 40%; 46% of K. pneumoniae were carbapenem-resistant and 76% cephalosporin-resistant. 56% of P. aeruginosa and 64% of A. baumannii were carbapenem-resistant; 78% of S. aureus were MRSA. Antibiotics were given to 1307 (88.6%), one antibiotic 39.9%, 2 antibiotics 44.7%, 3 antibiotics 10.6% and 4 antibiotics 0.8%, average 1.7 antibiotics per case. Colistin was given to 97 cases, of these 49% had reported carbapenem-resistant strains; 49% carbapenem-resistant cases were treated with colistin.ConclusionsThere is a high prevalence of HAI in Vietnamese PICUs, usually caused by GNB with a very high antibiotic resistant rate. Colistin is commonly used in combination with other antibiotics to treat these resistant infections.Session: Disinfection/ sterilization DS1 Processing of reusable medical devices in health service organizations: preventing HAIs at Macquarie University hospital: an Australian experience Roel Beltran Castillo Central Sterilizing Services Department, Manager Macquarie University Hospital, North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia Correspondence: Roel Beltran Castillo (roel.castillo@muh.org.au)",

Yeng May Ho, Jia Qi Kum, Bee Fong Poh, Kalisvar Marimuthu, Brenda Ang Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore Correspondence: Brenda Ang (Brenda_Ang@ttsh.com.sg) Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 2017, 6(Suppl 2):H12 BackgroundAuditing of Hand Hygiene compliance is usually done by the Infection Control (IC) team. Because it is time consuming and resource intensive, hospitals often rely on 'link nurses' to do audits. There are questions as to how these results would correspond to that done by other observers who do not belong to the same unit. As part of a hospital-wide Hand Hygiene program, an initiative to involve young doctors in Hand Hygiene activities was mooted and residents nominated by heads of departments to be hand hygiene auditors.Materials and methodsThese residents ('link doctors') were first trained by the Infection Control nurses, following WHO Five Moments, and underwent interrater reliability testing. They were tasked with doing audits on Hand Hygiene compliance for their own departments, at times of their choosing. The study period was from February to Sep 2015. The results of their audits were submitted to the Infection Control Unit, and compared with the results done by the IC unit.ResultsWhile the overall compliance rate when audits were done by the 'link doctors' was 76%, it was 46% when done by IC team. The only 'moment' where there was no difference in compliance rates between them was 'after patient contact'. Conclusions There was significant difference in hand hygiene compliance rates when audits were done by 'link doctors'. While there might be concerns about the validity of their results, such exercises could lead to improved understanding, ownership of, and participation in activities to improve hand hygiene. Tzu-Yin Liu, Sin-Man Chu, Hui-Zhu Chen, Tun-chieh Chen Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung Hospital, Kaohsiung,Cianjin District, TaiwanCorrespondence: Tzu-Yin Liu (ned740206@yahoo.com.tw)BackgroundTo achieve good compliance and correct hand hygiene for healthcare workers in clinical setting, we conducted quality audit by nonfixed observers to prevent the Hawthorne effect.This study aimed to train hand hygiene observers who can educate hand hygiene audit ability and reinforce the concepts of good compliance of correct hand hygiene Materials and methods The process included 1.Set up the standard of hand hygiene audit; 2. Hold the lecture for the perception of the importance of hand hygiene; 3. Correct hand hygiene hands-on practice: using fluorescent cream on hands and washing hands with water and soap and then checked hands under fluorescent lamp; 4. Teaching hand hygiene audit in real clinical settings; 5. Hand hygiene Q &A, sharing and discussion.ResultsThe workshop trained 23 nurses as hand hygiene observers and all passed the assessment. The average learning outcome evaluation is 86.3%. The average satisfactory rate of the workshop is 98.3% via the 5 domains of the value of learning, applicability, enhancing professional knowledge, the appropriate application of educational materials, the achievement of learning expectation. All trained hand hygiene observers can apply the concepts in clinical settings.ConclusionsThe workshop composed with hands-on practice, teaching in real clinical settings and sharing-discussion instead of one-way lecturing. This multimodal educational program integrated with lecturing, idea sharing, experiments and teach-reply methods to enhance learning outcomes and reinforce the hand hygiene perception. Through the educational program, we transferred the hand hygiene knowledge to modify healthcare workers' perception and then their quality improvement attitude to cooperate the patient safety strategies in the whole institute.H14Evaluation direct observation methods to measure compliance with hand hygiene rates in regional hospital Yichun Chen (clh30004@mail.chimei.org.tw) Department of Nursing, Chi Mei Medical Center, Liouying, Tainan, Taiwan Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 2017, 6(Suppl 2):H14 Background Compliance with hand hygiene is the most important concept in preventing infection to patients in health care settings. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on hand hygiene in health care indicate that the direct observation methods to measure compliance with hand hygiene are the gold standard, also the most reliable methods of measurement.The study aimed to explore the compliance with hand hygiene rates in regional hospital.Materials and methodsDirect observation methods were performed to measure compliance with hand hygiene in physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners and nurse assistants from January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 of a regional hospital in Taiwan. Conclusions Compliance with hand hygiene rates were higher than reported in the literature (CDC). Another problem with direct observation was the Hawthorne effect produced by the observation. When a medical practitioner discovered that he or she was observed, he or she would be conscious of his or her own observation and deliberately changed his or her behavior to increase the frequency of hand hygiene. In the pursuit of the desired positive results, and affect the hand hygiene compliance measurement results. Recommendation to regular change auditor or monitoring type, ex: video recorder, but given these measurement limitations, more valid, practical, and less costly methods are needed.BackgroundHand washing and respiratory hygiene are fundamental in infection control management. They seem a global language in health settings. A majority studies investigate the relationship between hand hygiene and infectious diseases transmission among healthcare staffs. The aim of this survey was to discover the efficiency of hand hygiene and cough manners education model among patients and visitors.Materials and methodsThis study measured by questionnaires with hand hygiene and cough manner observation compliance tools. Duration of data collection was from July, 2015 to August, 2016. 428 patients and visitors of a local community hospital in North Taiwan were submitted their questionnaire. Results 83.41% participants were over 61 years old (age group: 57.24% 61-64 years old, 26.17%over 65 years old). The finding from cough manner observation revealed that only 33.04% participants allowed cough manners while they have sneezing, coughing or flu symptoms. This had significant difference to the same question of questionnaire (82.24%). The difference also appeared in hand hygiene observation, 59.65% observers performed hand washing in their hand hygiene opportunities which was considerably lower than the questionnaire result (98.83%). These findings investigate the attitudes toward hand washing and respiratory hygiene compliance among patients and visitors. Thus, a patients and visitors' education model was applied for promoting hand hygiene and cough manners actions.ConclusionsAs the evaluation of education model, the percentage of observers allowed hand washing actions (86.09%) and cough manners (68.87%) after the education were increased. Therefore, the patients and visitors' education model is efficient in promoting hand washing and respiratory hygiene compliance.H16The effectiveness of alcohol-based hand rub bottle holder: an assessment with hand hygiene compliance rate and a satisfaction of emergency department personnel.

A product must meet established regulatory standard criteria to be used in the entire hospital. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy, skin compatibility, and end user acceptance of two new alcohol based formulations. Material and methods Two novel ABHR gel and foam 70% ethanol were tested by ASTM E1174 and European Norm (EN) 1500 for the in vivo hygienic hand rub, and by EN12791 for surgical hand disinfection. Skin irritation was evaluated according to the 21-Day Cumulative Irritation procedure and skin hydration measured by corneometer device. End user acceptance was conducted during trial periods through surveys.ResultsBoth formulations met all the in vivo efficacy tests to be considered as ABHR and ABSS with sustained effect of 3 hours. No potential skin irritation was demonstrated and end user showed preference over other products.ConclusionsWell-formulated ABHR gel and foam containing just 70% ethanol meets global efficacy norms for ABHR and ABSS, are mild to the skin, and accepted by end users.

Data on peripheral vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections (PVC-BSIs) are insufficient compared with data on central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections (CVC-BSIs). The protocol of duration of insertion of PVCs in our hospital was changed from every 7 days to every 4 days in March 2016. We aimed to compare the incidence of PVC-BSIs before and after the change.Materials and methodsWe retrospectively studied data from positive blood cultures of 122 patients diagnosed with PVC-BSIs from June 1, 2010 to August 30, 2016 at Tokyo Medical University Hospital.ResultsThe number of incidents of PVC-BSIs in the years 2010 to 2016 was 4, 5, 11, 16, 13, 49, and 24 cases, respectively. The monthly average from January 2015 to February 2016 was 4.1 cases, but from March 2016 to August 2016 the monthly average was 2.7 cases.ConclusionsThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that PVCs do not need to be replaced more frequently than at 96-hour intervals, but recommend replacement at least every 7 days to reduce the risk of infection and phlebitis in adults. In our hospital, we modified this protocol to every 4 days because we observed many cases where the catheter site was not examined daily and the records of insert duration. This protocol change resulted in a reduction in the incidence of PVC-BSIs and may therefore represent a method to reduce this type of infection.Session: Prevention of Site Specific InfectionsP4 A two-year hospital-wide surveillance of central line-associated bloodstream infections in a Korean hospital Hye Kyung Seo 1 , Joo-Hee Hwang 1 , Myoung Jin Shin 1 , Su Young Kim 1 , Eu Suk Kim 1,2 , Kyoung-Ho Song 2 , Hong Bin Kim 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; 2 Infection Control Office, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea Correspondence: Hye Kyung Seo (shkid79@naver.com) Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 2017, 6(Suppl 2):P4Background Surveillance and interventions of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) had mainly been targeted in intensive care units (ICUs). Central lines as invasive procedures are increasingly used in hospitals outside of ICUs, especially in immunocompromised or elderly people. We performed a hospital-wide surveillance of CLABSIs to evaluate the current status and find out the future strategic plans to decrease CLBASI rates. Material and methods All patients having central lines were screened for CLABSIs at a 1,328-bed tertiary teaching hospital between January 2014 and December 2015 using the electronic surveillance program. Clinical information including types of central lines was collected. CLABSI rates were calculated using the definitions of National health and Safety Network (NHSN). Results A total of 154 CLABSIs was identified, of which 72 and 82 occurred in the general wards and the ICUs (0.81 and 2.71 per 1,000 catheter days), respectively. For 71 CLABSI events diagnosed within one week, 48 non-tunneled CVCs and 16 PICCs were in place, respectively. However, for 113 CLABSIs diagnosed after a week, non-tunneled CVCs, tunneled CVCs, and PICCs accounted for 44, 33, and 36 cases, respectively. While the majority (72.2%) of CLABSIs in the ICUs was related with non-tunneled CVCs, tunneled CVCs (38.9%) and PICCs (36.8%) were the most common types in general wards. Conclusions CLABSI rates in general wards were relatively low, but long-term indwelling catheters were more frequently used than in ICUs. Therefore, a tailored intervention should be implemented to prevent CLABSIs according to the wards.Session: Prevention of Site Specific Infections P5 Planning and implementation of an infection control training course for home-care nursing team Lai-Si Un, Choi-Ian Vong Health Bureau of Macau SARS, Macau, Macau Correspondence: Lai-Si Un (mercy.un@gmail.com)BackgroundThe lack of well-trained, experienced infection control personnel prevents healthcare-associated infections in home-care nursing team. During our practicum of the postgraduate specialty-nursing program, we collaboratively planned and implemented a training course for prevention catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) to address this need.Materials and methodsThe course relied on the guideline for prevention of CAUTI of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States of America. The CAUTI prevention program of Centers for Disease Control of Taiwan, the CAUTI prevention bundle of Centre for Health Protection of Hong Kong, collaboration with community nurses of health center and resources available at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The 1-hour course consisted of lecture session and case discussion, trained 9 nurses and 6 nurse students.ResultsThe result of evaluation questionnaire showed that course content, teacher performance met the trainees' needs, and that 100% trainees acquired the necessary knowledge. 60% of the trainees were \"satisfied\" and other 40% were \"very satisfied\".ConclusionsOur experience can serve as a model for other organizations interested in strengthening infection control and prevention at local sites.Session: Prevention of Site Specific InfectionsP6 Implementing an effective surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance: basis for quality improvement Jose Paulo Flor, Nicolo Andrei A\u00f1onuevo, Marko Bautista, V James De Roxas, Justine Vergara, Marion Kwek Asian Hospital and Medical Center, Muntinlupa, National Capital Region, Philippines Correspondence: Nicolo Andrei A\u00f1onuevo (naanonuevo@asianhospital.com) Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 2017, 6(Suppl 2):P6Background Surgical site infection and surveillance remains to be a challenge in a developing country. This study aimed to decrease surgical site infections through a systematic process and a real-time monitoring.Materials and methodsThe methods used are daily rounds to check the wound of the postoperative patients while admitted, follow up phone calls to patients every 2 weeks until the patient get passed beyond the window period of possible surgical site infection occurrence and bundles of care for prevention of SSI activation. Through the use of SSI surveillance along with the bundles of care, surgical site infection cases were captured proactively by the Infection Prevention and Control Unit and interventions were implemented immediately targeting the source of infection. Feedback was provided to the involved department whose surgical site infection cases went beyond the benchmark. Through the process initiated, there was a decrease in surgical site infections from 1.9% in 2013 to 0.9% as of August 2016. This downward trend was managed despite of expansion in the procedures included in the surveillance.ConclusionsIt is therefore concluded that SSI Surveillance and bundles of care are effective way to promote safety among post-operative patients.Department of MedicalServices, Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital, Singapore, Singapore; 2 Department of Nursing Services, Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital, Singapore, Singapore; 3 Department of Allied Health, Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital, Singapore, Singapore; 4 Department of Health Performance Office, Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital, Singapore, Singapore Correspondence: Jocelyn Koh (jocelyn_koh@amkh.org.sg)Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 2017, 6(Suppl 2):P7 Background Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a common hospital acquired infection which can lead to prolonged hospitalisation and mortality.

Major guidelines recommend indications for urinary indwelling catheter (IDC) be documented at time of placement. This facilitates prompt evaluation for removal subsequently, thereby minimizing inappropriate catheterization and risks of UTI. We aimed to evaluate UTI prevention guideline compliance by reviewing indications for IDC placement and frequency of proper documentation. Material and methods General ward patients with an IDC in place between 5th to12th August 2016 were identified by chart review. Demographic and clinical data related to IDC placement were extracted. Results Among 46 patients with IDCs, documentation of urinary catheterization indication was performed by doctors in 25 patients (54.4%) and by nurses in 39 (84.8%). Four patients had no indications documented. Only 22 patients had indications documented by both nurses and doctors, of which 19 (86.4%) matched. Twenty-four patients (52.2%) did not have complete documentation. The indication most frequently documented by doctors was retention of urine (39.1%), followed by strict intake-output monitoring (37.0%) and perioperative monitoring (4.4%). Conclusions Documentation of indications for urinary catheterization is not adequate despite guideline recommendations. Documentation by doctors was less frequent compared to nurses, and indications may not match, thus indicating that it may have been inappropriate. Lack of documentation may cause difficulties in deciding if continued use of IDC is needed, and resulted in delaying catheter removal and increasing risks of catheter associated UTIs.

Bundle approach can prevent VAP. We aimed to describe knowledge attitudes and practices regarding VAP bundle approach.Materials and methodsA descriptive cross sectional study was conducted among nurses in Intensive Care Units (ICU) at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Data were collected using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire.ResultsThe median of the total scores for knowledge was 62.9%. Of 229 participated, 10% scored more than 75%, 60.7% scored 55% -74%, 22.7% scored 41% -54% while 6.6% scored below 40% marks. Participants knowledge was not associated with previous training on intensive care (p = 1.06), level of education (p = 1.24) and period of service in an ICU (p = 0.65). Their knowledge were high regarding the use of closed suction systems (80.4%), correct positioning of patients (85.6%) and the correct angle of bed elevation ( 82.1%) to prevent VAP. They have poor knowledge on frequency of changing humidifiers (14.85%) and changing of suction systems (7.86%). Lack of knowledge was evident in preventive strategies such as; selecting the site of the ET tube (42.4%), when to change ventilator circuits (48.9%) and use of kinetic or standard beds (56%) to reduce the risk of VAP. Overall self-reported practices were 75.4%. Poor practices were reported in wearing a polythene apron during ET Suctioning (35.8%).ConclusionsOverall knowledge and attitudes towards VAP bundle among participants were satisfactory.

The American Hospital Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) estimates that two million people have annually urinary tract infection. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection is the most common type of nosocomial infection (about 40%). The opportunity of occurrence of urinary tract infection will increase if indwelling catheter is placed for more than seven days, and also once a catheter is placed, the daily incidence of bacteriuria is about 3-8%. In 2015, indwelling catheter associated urinary tract infection rate was 3.35\u2030 that higher than other units. In order to effectively reduce the indwelling catheter associated urinary tract infection, we organized the team to improve this problem, in order to reduce the use of indwelling urinary catheters, catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates, to maintain patient safety, and to improve quality of the care of indwelling catheter. Materials and methods (1) The concept of nursing staff was not correct, education and training were incomplete. (2) Physicians easily forgot patients with catheterization.(3) Paper glue caused skin damage easily, urine bag fixed rope too loose to touch the ground, and nursing assistants did not know the perineum cleaning methods. (4) The concept of nursing assistants was incorrect.ResultsThe indwelling catheter associated urinary tract infection rate dropped to 0\u2030.
