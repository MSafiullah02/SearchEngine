Its visceral form, known as kala-azar, is widely distributed in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean region.[1] About 350 million people are at risk of infection with Leishmania parasites, and over 12 million people are infected with different species of the parasite, with over 400,000 new cases each year.[1] Incidence increase is associated with urban development, forest devastation, environmental changes, and migrations of people to areas where the disease is endemic.[23]",

Among them, quercetin with flavonoid structure showed antileishmanial effects.[6] The antileishmanial activity of 3\u2019,4\u2019,3,5,7 -pentahydroxyflavonol (quercetin) derivatives is partly attributed to the position and pKa of phenolic or catechol hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the aim of this research is to improve quercetin leishmanicidal effects by acylation of hydroxyl group or regioselective 7-O-substitution of electron-donating or electron capture groups and changing their pKa and consequently their activities.",

After purification, it yielded quercetin-2,5,3\u2019,4\u2019-tetraacetate (3) with free hydroxyl group on C-7 (60%) and quercetin-2,5,3\u2033-triacetate (4) with free hydroxyl groups on C-7 and C-4' (40%). Compound 3 was arylated with 4-methylbenzyl chloride and 4-nitrobenzyl chloride, separately. Reaction mixture was then deacetylated by treatment with ammonia (2M) in acetone at 0\u00b0C for 5 min. Excess ammonia was neutralized by adding HCl (0.5 M). Finally, 7-O-arylquercetins 5 and 6 were purified by RP-18 RPC using water: methanol (30:70) as solvent.[10]",

Protection of these chelating sites is expected to reduce the interaction of ligand with Fe ions. In this agreement, compounds 3 (quercetin-2,5,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetraacetate) and 4 (quercetin-2,5,3\u2032-triacetate) with no free chelating group were less active than compounds 1 (quercetin), 5 (7-O-paranitrobenzylquercetin), and 6 (7-O-paramethylbenzylquercetin) with free chelating groups localized on C-5, C-3, and B ring. Therefore, 5-OH, 3-OH, and ortho 3' and 4\u2019-dihydroxyl groups in ring B are involved in leishmanicidal activity in quercetin derivatives. In comparision with compound 5 with paranitrobenzyl and 6 with paramethylbenzenyl on C-7, compound 6 showed more antileishmanial activity probably because of increased chelating activity of 5-hydroxy and 4-oxo in A ring, and also more parasite membrane penetration.",

In a reverse manner, addition of referrated iron chelators like FeDFO, Fe (Ll)3, and Fe (CP94)3 to cultured media restored parasite growth, which means that proliferation inhibition is caused by the iron chelator.[15]",

In this regard, Virginia Iniesta team founded that cellular Leishmania infection is dependent to arginase enzyme, which generates L-ornithine essential for Leishmania growth.[16] Afterward, Manjolin et al. showed that quercetin exerted its antileishmanial effect by inhibitory effect on arginase enzyme, which is essential for parasite proliferation.[17] In a different study, Fonseca-Silva et al. reported another mechanism for the antileishmanial activity of quercetin against L. amazonensis promastigotes. They founded that reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction induced parasite death (IC50 value of 31.4 \u03bcM) through collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential.[18] Mittra et al. reported also that quercetin inhibited the growth of L. donovani promastigotes by interacting with DNA topoisomerases and promoting site-specific DNA cleavage leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with IC50 value of 45.5 \u03bcM.[19]",
