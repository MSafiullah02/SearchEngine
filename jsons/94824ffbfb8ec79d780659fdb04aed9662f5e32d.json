The pathogen induced COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1, 2 . According the data from the World Health Organization (WHO), by 27 April, 2020, there have been 2,883,603 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 198,842 deaths 3 . Although respiratory failure is the main clinical character of COVID-19 patients, quite a few patients developed cardiovascular diseases, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis and arrhythmia 4 . However, the effect of COVID-19 on cardiac valves, the hinge during the process of blood flow, has not been fully identified pathologically and functionally. Therefore, it is a significant question that whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus could attack the cardiac valves.",

Additionally, ACE2 was also detected in cardiac valves, specifically aortic valve in human, and associated with the process of aortic valve stenosis. Detected by immunostaining, ACE2 located at stromal fibroblasts, mainly in spongiosa layer. Stenotic valves showed decrescent extensiveness of ACE2 and abnormal expression of ACE2 in macrophages and myofibroblasts surrounding neovessels. Compared with normal valves, downregulated ACE2 in stenotic valves was determined by RT-PCR. Downregulation of ACE2/Angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis may promote fibrosis, proliferation and inflammation in cardiac valves, causing valvular sclerosis and hemodynamic disorder finally 6 . Considering the complex and dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in infected soma, the ACE2 + cells in cardiac valves could be attacked by SARS-CoV-2 directly. Dysfunction of these cells could induce pathological procedure in cardiac valves and obstruct regular blood flow consequently.",

Cytokine storm, another lethal pathology in COVID-19 featured with IL6, IL10 and TNF-\u03b1, may play an important role in the regression and maintenance of valvular lesions 8, 9 . Cardiac valves disease is usually slow-moving and often requires a long journey from the \"ignition\" of pathology to related clinical symptoms. As the direct attack mediated by ACE2 + cells and indirect attack from cytokine storm, the damages in cardiac valves induced by SARS-CoV-2 could not be ignored. Thus, we emphatically advise that the survivors of COVID-19, especially those with acquired heart disease, should be examined for cardiac function periodically after recovery. The expression and biological function of ACE2 in cardiac valves should be identified further and cohort studies about cardiac valves targeting infected populations may provide guidance to public health policy.",
