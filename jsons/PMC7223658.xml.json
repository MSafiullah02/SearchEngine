Furthermore, she also had a headache for 2 days, which had been diffuse in nature without features favoring meningism, discernible systemic symptoms, or fever to suggest an association or etiology.

Transthoracic 2D-echocardiohraphy (Phillips EQIP CVx, made in Germany) revealed moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40% with left ventricular global hypokinesia, along with a grade 2 severity mitral regurgitation, grade 1 severity aortic regurgitation; a clinically insignificant thin rim of pericardial effusion with no right atrial or ventricular collapse was noted. Following a cardiac consult, a clinical decision was taken to manage her medically with diuretics and fluid restriction.

Typically during the neurologic episodes, the ESR and plasma viscosity are elevated while C-reactive protein levels tend to be normal. Lupus-related serum antibody tests are usually supportive with cerebral lupus [10]. Majority of seizures in SLE are reported to be generalized, although both generalized and partial seizures can occur [1, 2, 11]. Seizures tend to occur early in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus [12] and in one case series, nearly 54% of patients had seizures within the first year of diagnosis of SLE [1]. Serologically, the presence of certain autoimmune antibodies heralds the risk of seizure in SLE; these include moderate-to-high titers of IgG anti cardiolipin anti bodies [2, 3, 13, 14], autoantibodies to beta-2-glycoproteins [14, 15], moderate- to high-titer serum anti-Smith antibodies [13], and anti-50 kDa antibody [16]. Though seizures are common is SLE, status epilepticus is considered a rare phenomenon either at presentation or even along the course of the disease [17, 18]. Our patient presented with status epilepticus and based on the clinical and serological findings, the active state of her disease could be taken as the cause for her presentation in status epilepticus.",

In this case, we presumed the diagnosis of lupus myocarditis as she fulfilled the criteria for SLE, with most of the viral studies being negative and with no risk factors for atherosclerosis causing ischemic heart disease. Most of such cases were diagnosed on similar basis in the literature [21\u201325]. Treatment of lupus myocarditis has not been assessed in controlled trials since this is an infrequent manifestation of lupus. But dramatic improvement in cardiac function has been noted with aggressive therapy with oral or intravenous glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive therapy, and intravenous immunoglobulins [26\u201328].",

            "text": "The patient showed dramatic clinical improvement and by day 14 was asymptomatic. It was a challenge to decide whether the patient needed steroids or advanced immunosuppressive therapy. Her serological markers suggested active disease but not all patients with these serologic markers have active disease and these markers do not necessarily predict disease exacerbation. Also, fluctuations in laboratory test values are poor predictors of disease exacerbations in SLE [29]. Even in the presence of serological markers favoring disease, e.g., low complement and elevated anti-DNA antibody titers, patients may not have clinical evidence of active disease [30]. However, usually clinical and laboratory correlation in SLE tend to show a homogenous relationship and most SLE patients showing clinical-serological concordance with only minority showing discordance. Therefore, it is important to monitor both clinical and serological features in patients with SLE [31]. Steiman, A.J. and colleagues suggested that treatment decisions in SLE patients must rely upon close clinical observation and therapy should be adjusted if there are signs of clinical worsening of the disease [32]. Considering risk versus that of benefit, starting steroids at very young age will cause detrimental side effects long term and since she did have any clinical features of active disease, a clinical decision was taken not to start immunosuppressive therapy in our patient. Instead, we planned to monitor her closely for clinical or serological evidence of relapse and evolution. However, in the context of possible recurrence of seizures, especially with underlying SLE, she was continued on sodium valproate, with long-term neurology review and monitoring. She was reviewed recently, 6 months after the initial episode, and was doing well.",

Our patient presented with status epilepticus and acute cardiomyopathy with heart failure, but showed dramatic improvement within 2 weeks. Status epilepticus and acute myocarditis with heart failure are uncommon yet potentially fatal manifestations of SLE. This case emphasizes the importance of considering autoimmune diseases into the spectrum of differential diagnosis early when atypical clinical presentations occur specially with multi-organ involvement as prompt diagnosis may help in reducing morbidity and mortality by allowing early appropriate and effective treatment.",
