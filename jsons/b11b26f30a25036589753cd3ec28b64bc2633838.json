The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild to life-threatening. Some cases might progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple organ function failure. An epidemiological survey indicated that the general population is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory droplets and contact are considered the main routes of transmission.

First of all, no research has yet accurately established the contagious period of COVID-19. Besides patients and asymptomatic carriers, those in convalescence may also be infectious. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory tract specimens may be persistent or recurrently positive during the course of this disease. Furthermore, Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), identified as the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was highly expressed in the lungs rather than in the upper respiratory tract (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . The result of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test likely depends on the viral load of the specimen. Therefore, there could be false negatives on occasion for oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs tests, affected by the site from which the sample was taken, the experience of the operator, and the actual quantity of virus. The Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimen test is considered more accurate but with a higher exposure risk. In addition to the above specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in a patient's sputum, blood, or stool swab by RT-PCR assay. Running multiple tests and collecting different specimens would be more effective approaches to maximize sensitivity. Combination with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test and other detective methods such as a specific antigen, IgM antibody, or the next-generation sequencing, is also conducive to diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 595, "end": 612, "text": "(Lu et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 613, "end": 631, "text": "Zhou et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Given the possibility of recurrently positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the clinical course and to reduce the risk of transmission in other COVID-19 cases, we suggest that: (1) both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be performed to reduce the false-negative rate.
