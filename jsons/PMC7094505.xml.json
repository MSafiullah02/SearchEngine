The lion had normal gait and posture, but it collided with objects in its immediate surroundings. A motion detection test performed by tossing objects across the lion's field of view revealed no responses and the animal failed to visually track the moving objects.

Confirming ocular lesions as FIP in non-domestic felids, including African lions, faces many challenges, not least in finding suitable cases for investigation, especially in free-ranging lions. It is hoped that further investigations will add to the info8rmation about the susceptibility to FIP and the ocular manifestation of FIP in this species. As far as we know, this is the first confirmed case of FIP in an African lion and of ocular FIP in a non-domestic felid.",
