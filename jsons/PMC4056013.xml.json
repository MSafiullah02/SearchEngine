This involves not only monocytes and macrophages, but also CD4 lymphocytes and B lymphocytes [2]. Under normal conditions, CD4 lymphocytes orchestrate B lymphocyte responses for the secretion of the polyvalent immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies that are of crucial importance for the opsonization and the subsequent rapid clearance of the invading microorganisms [3]. Immunoparalysis of sepsis is characterized by defective B-lymphocyte responses toward low immunoglobulin production [2].",

It opsonizes bacteria and primes phagocytosis by neutrophils; it binds and inactivates endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria and exotoxins of Gram-positive cocci; and it also binds and inactivates proinflammatory host mediators like cytokines. Its role is underscored by models of experimental sepsis in mice; survival is prolonged after induction of sepsis through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) within the animals that possess the highest potential for IgM-primed phagocytosis [16]. Recent data coming both from rodents and humans suggest that release of IgM is primed by a new subset of B lymphocytes known as IRA (innate response activator) B cells. These cells belong to the innate defense system, they contain large cytoplasmic stores of IgM antibodies and they are the main effectors of the rapid release of IgM. IRA B cells are depleted in experimental sepsis and this leads to early death [17]. The evidence coming from experimental animal data may help explain the importance of the ex vivo production of IgM from our patient population. All patients produced much lower IgM than healthy volunteers; this defect was exaggerated in septic shock. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that during severe sepsis lymphocytes are hypofunctional for IgM production but high circulating IgM compensates for the patient\u2019s needs; once septic shock develops circulating IgM is fully consumed and lymphocytes are completely anergic for any IgM production.",
