At the same time, oseltamivir, as an over-the-counter drug, is also a popular antiviral drug. As healthcare workers fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have found that many patients experiencing discomfort or considered to be infected with a virus take oseltamivir. From severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and now the current COVID-19 epidemic, there is not plenty of evidence showing that oseltamivir is effective against coronavirus. Still, there is also no sufficient evidence to refute its ineffectiveness. We cannot predict whether there will be a pandemic of respiratory coronavirus in the future, so we hope to initiate such research and preliminarily explore whether oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, which can better guide healthcare workers in the selection of appropriate antiviral drugs in the face of coronavirus epidemics. If oseltamivir is effective, then a wide promotion of its application often can achieve a double effect with half the effort.",

The atypical pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that broke out in Guangzhou, China, in 2003, linked oseltamivir to coronavirus. Zhang et al. found that the active site of the Spike (S) 1 Protein of SARS is similar to that of neuraminidase, suggesting that neuraminidase inhibitors may be useful to treat SARS-CoV 2 . However, despite this similarity, no clinical data suggest that oseltamivir is effective in treating SARS-CoV. With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, oseltamivir has once again become a hot topic. A study from Thailand reported that a 71-year-old patient with severe COVID-19 on January 29, 2020 underwent a 48-hour treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with oseltamivir, which improved the patient's condition, and the throat swab test became negative 3 . Although a single case report does not prove the effectiveness of oseltamivir for COVID-19, it once again linked oseltamivir to the treatment of a coronavirus-induced disease. As frontline healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19, we were interested in the treatment regimen of this case and found most patients with COVID-19 who were symptomatic have used oseltamivir. We believed that it is of practical significance to further study the effect of oseltamivir on COVID-19. Because of its significant effectiveness on influenza and being sold over the counter, oseltamivir is not only stocked in common households but also a common antiviral drug in primary hospitals. Therefore, if oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19\uff0c the treatment could be family-oriented. If, instead, the treatment effectiveness is not significant, the use of oseltamivir should be stopped, which will avoid delaying other .

TM-score was used to analyze the structural similarity; 0.0 < TM-score < 0.30 was defined as \"random structural similarity\", and 0.5 < TM-score < 1.00 was defined as \"in about the same fold\". The active site of influenza A and B neuraminidase were determined based on the location of ligand in crystal structure ( Fig. 2A) 18, 19 . By comparing 4CPY with 3Ti6, the TM-score of the two was found to be 0.94460, which proved that the two were structurally homologous. Subsequently, we aligned the structures of S protein, NRBD, 3CL pro, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp with 3Ti6; the TM-scores were 0.30077, 0.19254, 0.28766, 0.30666, and 0.34047, respectively (Fig. 2G) . The results suggested that there was only a structural similarity between the protein structure of the above SARS-CoV-2 and 3Ti6. The active center of the S protein was mainly the RBD domain ( Fig. 2B green region) and S2 subunit HR1 domain (Fig. 2B blue region) , which were also two important targets for studying the inhibition of S protein 20, 21 . We found that the similar structure of 3Ti6 and S protein is located in the N-terminal domain (NTD) region of S protein. As the active center of NC, we found that NRBD did not match the active center of 3Ti6 (Fig2C). The active center of 3CLpro was determined based on that it is homologous to the 3CLpro from SARS-CoV. Previous studies have confirmed the active center of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV. Thus, this region was used as the active center of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 12 . By alignment, we found that the active centers of the two proteins were similar (Fig. 2D) . Subsequently, we also determined the active center of the PLpro and Pol/RdRp based on the homology of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and those of SARS-CoV. And we found that the active center of PLpro did not match the active center from 3Ti6 through the alignment of structure (Fig.   .

Chi-square test was used to determine differences between group remission and progressive. P-values < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001 were considered significant. Finally, 79 patients were included for analysis. Among them, there were 31 patients in remission, aged 50.77 \u00b1 14.919. There were 48 non-remission patients, and their age was 50.52 \u00b1 15.062. There was no significant difference in age between the two groups. In the remission group, there were 12 males (with a proportion of 38.7%), and in the non-remission group there were 25 males (52.1%); there was no statistical difference in sex between the two groups. We analyzed the use of oseltamivir in the two groups. In the remission group, a total of seven patients used oseltamivir with a proportion of 22.6%. In the non-remission group, a total of 35 patients used oseltamivir, with a proportion of 72.9%. The chi-square value was 19.166, and there was a significant statistical difference between the two groups.

We used structural alignment to find that the active center of 3CLpro was similar to that of influenza A neuraminidase. Subsequently, we used a molecular docking method to explore whether oseltamivir could effectively bind to the NRBD, 3CLPro, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. It was found that oseltamivir carboxylic acid was more favorable to bind to the active site of 3CLpro effectively, but its inhibitory effects was not strong. Finally, we used in vitro study and retrospective case analysis to verify our speculations. We found that oseltamivir is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro study and the clinical use of oseltamivir did not improve the patients' symptoms and signs and did not slow the disease progression. Therefore, we consider that oseltamivir isn't suitable for the treatment of COVID-19. During the outbreak of novel coronavirus, when oseltamivir is not effective for the patients after they take it, health workers should be highly vigilant about the possibility of COVID-19. At the same time, it should be noted that we are still in the influenza season, and we have also found five cases of influenza A in combined with COVID-19. Therefore, oseltamivir should be combined in the treatment regimen in a timely manner when influenza occurs. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We first downloaded the protein sequences of NC (YP_009724397.2), nsp3 (YP_009725299.1), and Pol/RdRp (YP_009725307.1) from the GenePept protein sequence database and used Swiss-model (www.swissmodel.org) program for homology modeling. The models were constructed successfully and shown in Fig1A-C. Among them\uff0cthe NC of SARS-CoV-2 contains 419 amino acid residues. The search of a homology template using the Swissmodel found that the 35-174 residues of NC have an identity of 92.37% with the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NRBD) of NC from SARS-CoV(PDB ID: 1ssk)\uff0cwhich is the active region for the binding of NC of SARS-CoV with RNA.",

The majority of residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro belonged to reasonable residues (green), and there were 91.27%, 89.91%, and 98.73% reasonable residues in NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro respectively (Fig1A-C). The results of Procheck were mainly shown by Ramachandran plots. As can be seen in the Ramachandran plot, there were A, B, L, a, b, l, p, ~a, ~b, ~p, and ~l labeled areas. In Porcheck, A, B, and L are classified as reasonable areas; a, b, l are relatively reasonable regions, whereas ~a, ~b, ~p, and ~l are acceptable regions. The distributions of amino acid residues in the structure were observed. The large proportion of amino acids in reasonable regions proves that the model is of high quality. It can be seen that most of the residues of NRBD, Pol/RdRp, and PLpro were in A, B, and L, and the reasonable region residues accounted for 92.9%, 92.5%, and 90.0%, respectively (Fig1A-C). The above results suggested that the three modeled structures passed the evaluation, were of good quality, and could be used for further research.",
