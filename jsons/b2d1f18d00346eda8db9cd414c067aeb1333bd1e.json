            "text": "Dear Editor, We thank Ponziani et al. for their interest in our manuscript and for their thoughtful comments. 1 They raised the concern that the 37.6% prevalence of NAFLD in our cohorts was rather high compared to the 26.9% reported in Northeastern China and wondered the possibility that we have over diagnosis NAFLD. If there is over diagnosis of NAFLD, the prevalence should be similar in the stable and progressive groups, as opposed to the marked difference, 25.8% vs 87.2 % respectively, observed in our study. Secondly, the two hospitals in our study are in Anhui (Eastern China) and Beijing (Northern China), not in Northeastern China (Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang provinces), therefore using the 27.6% prevalence might not be relevant. 2 We agreed that HSI is affected by inflammatory activities. To reduce over-diagnoses, we used the lowest ALT/AST value from the medical records of the subjects in the preceding 12 months before COVID-19 diagnosis. If the subject had no ALT/AST records in the preceding 12 months, the lowest value during the current admission and follow-up would be used to calculate HSI. Also, the mean AST, ALT values were not significantly different between the stable and progressive groups. If inflammations lead to elevation of transaminases and subsequently over diagnosis of HIS as suggested, again it should affect both the stable and progressive groups equally. In our cohort, 6/202 (3%) of subjects fulfilled the criteria of excessive alcohol intake (\u2265 30 g/d for man and \u2265 20 g/d for women), with 5/163(3.1%) and 1/39(2.6%) in the stable and progressive groups respectively (P = 1.000), as shown in Table 1 , row 6. 3 Only 2/76 (2.6%) patients with excessive alcohol intake were NAFLD, and 4/126 (3.2%) with excessive alcohol intake patients were not NAFLD (P = 1.000). Nonetheless, we acknowledge the limitation of using non-invasive assessment of NAFLD. 4 However, with the priority concern on the safety of the medical staff and the patients with COVID-19, further non-invasive or invasive assessments (such as liver biopsy) were not undertaken. In the near future, we hope that conjoint effort to have \"big data\" collection, such as the \"APCOLIS\" study (\"APASL Covid Liver Injury Spectrum) (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/covid-liver) will enhance our understanding of the role of NAFLD/MAFLD in COVID-19. 5 Though HIV infection was defined as a comorbidity, none of the subjects in our cohort had positive HIV serology or documented HIV infection in the past.
