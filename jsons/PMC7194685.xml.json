Similarly, cellular therapy services should be able to quickly respond to a pandemic, or other major incident, through a centralized and coordinated response that takes into account the unique needs and priorities of the health system. Along with the clinical and logistical complexities inherent to cellular therapy, in the era of COVID-19, or a similar pandemic, additional anticipated challenges include staff shortages due to potential exposure, limitation of resources in personal protective equipment, hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and mechanical ventilation, as well as potential delays in shipment of cellular therapy products. Therefore, careful assessment, planning, allocation of resources, and utilization of existing infrastructure is essential. This mandates a coordinated effort between the cellular therapy program and their hospital's emergency planning group.",

For patients treated in the outpatient setting, ensure appropriate follow-up and availability for rapid evaluation in those who experience toxicity.\u2022Initiate lymphodepleting chemotherapy only following CAR T cell product receipt onsite, given the potential impact on supply chain operations.\u2022Inpatient resources: encourage virtual team rounding and perform one examination per patient per day, if appropriate. In selected patients in whom an exam is unlikely to inform assessment and management, consider forgoing the physical exam.\u2022Housing: Ensure a clear plan as to where patients will be housed during the immediate 4 weeks surrounding their CAR T cell therapy, if not returning home.\u2022Outpatient follow-up care: Perform outpatient visits via telemedicine, when feasible.\u2022Radiology and laboratory services: Minimize all nonessential lab work and radiology appointments.\u2022Pharmacy: Preferentially use oral over parenteral administration when appropriate.\u2022Pandemic-specific considerations: Ensure the continuous availability of a cellular therapy team member with the capacity to respond to COVID-19 issues. Establish a center-specific workflow for COVID-19-positive patients. Consider creating COVID-19-specific inpatient units with dedicated rounding teams.\n",

The sudden emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is a threat to disrupt the delivery of cellular therapy. In preparation for this surge of virally infected patients, hospitals worldwide have instituted measures to defer multiple patient care interventions, including such treatments as autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma. With the COVID-19 pandemic, travel is risk-laden and constrained. Local housing, such as the American Cancer Society Hope Lodges, and many hotels are now closed. Visitor policies, including caregivers, are highly restrictive, and hospital resources, particularly those involving intensive care support, are experiencing critical shortages.

Medical teams can also develop algorithms focused on inpatient or outpatient delivery according to institutional resources and needs. Therapeutic decision making regarding cellular therapy product selection also may be driven by resource utilization demands; efforts to manage patients as much as possible in the outpatient setting to preserve inpatient resources should be considered.

The pivotal phase II studies revealed that many of the traditional patient- and disease-specific characteristics associated with poor outcomes with chemotherapy-based treatment were not poor prognostic features in the setting of CAR T cell therapy. These include double- or triple-hit features, lymphoma subtype (germinal center or activated B cell-like), international prognostic index, and age >65 years [2,3].

In pediatric centers, there is currently less of a bed shortage as centers have focused on decreasing the inpatient census in anticipation of the pandemic peak. Given that few children are currently being admitted with COVID-19, the focus has shifted to staff availability in pediatric hospitals. Several adult centers are providing this therapy in the 18- to 25-year age group, although ICU bed availability may remain a relevant concern.

Similarly, high grade (grade 3-4) CRS rates seen in the ELIANA registration trial for tisa-cel were 48%, compared to 14% during recent commercial use [23]. Reasons for lower rates of severe CRS may include earlier referral patterns, where the proportion of refractory patients with high disease burden may be lower. Additionally, earlier CRS intervention with tocilizumab may play a role. A recently published prospective trial of preemptive tocilizumab administration met its predefined study endpoint of 1/3 reduction in grade 4 CRS in patients with a high disease burden, suggesting that earlier CRS management might reduce the risk of severe CRS [24]. These lower ICU admission rates make it more practical to consider tisa-cel in R/R ALL, especially given potential concerns about ICU bed availability.",

A second test may be considered within 72 hours of CAR T cell infusion to enhance sensitivity and ensure that no interim infection has occurred, given that viral infections (COVID-19 or otherwise) may potentiate CRS [31].

FDA approval of tocilizumab was granted based on retrospective data demonstrating that the majority of patients with severe or life-threatening CRS responded to treatment with 1 or 2 doses [36]. Since regulatory approval, there has been a shift toward earlier intervention with tocilizumab in light of data showing a decrease in the severity and duration of CRS without a signal of reduced CAR T cell efficacy [33, 34, 35,37]. There are a growing number of anecdotal reports of a possible benefit of tocilizumab in patients with severe respiratory symptoms from COVID-19 38, 39, 40. Indeed, there are accounts of tocilizumab reducing the duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and even permitting weaning from ventilatory support [39]. This has led to the initiation of several clinical trials and the off-label use of tocilizumab in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. This raises a concern that the supply of tocilizumab may become limited, prompting rationing among patients with COVID-19 and patients with other FDA-approved indications.",

            "text": "In the face of such a challenge, we recommend that centers continue to follow REMS guidelines as outlined on the package inserts and have at least 2 doses of tocilizumab available for each patient before CAR T cell infusion. In addition, we recommend strongly considering the practice of early tocilizumab use at the onset of grade 2 CRS. Patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy are receiving potentially life-saving treatment; therefore, it is paramount to ensure the availability of tocilizumab to mitigate serious toxicity and the need for advanced supportive care measures. Thought has been given to reducing the dose of tocilizumab in the absence of adequate studies to determine optimal dose and frequency in CRS. Early phase I and II trials of tocilizumab demonstrated efficacy and significant declines in surrogate inflammatory markers with doses as low as 4 mg/kg [41,42]; however, subsequent pharmacokinetic studies revealed the observed mean maximum concentration of tocilizumab after the first dose was 41% lower in patients with CRS than in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, suggesting faster clearance of tocilizumab in patients experiencing CRS [36]. Therefore, we would not recommend altering the FDA-approved dose at this time. We do, however, recommend that no more than 2 doses of tocilizumab be administered per patient, because the overwhelming majority of patients with grade >3 CRS in the FDA cohorts responded by the second dose. It is surmised that responses may be even higher with early administration. When managing CRS, it is imperative that treating centers be mindful of the potential for limitations in tocilizumab supply. Although many clinical trials of unproven benefit are on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that rational studies of CRS prevention and treatment should continue because they may provide significant advantages to patients by improving safety, limiting the need for scarce intensive care support, and preserving a possibly limited supply of tocilizumab. We acknowledge that these assessments and recommendations are fluid and may require modification as tocilizumab availability changes.",

Such measures can alleviate pressure on constrained healthcare resources and optimize care delivery to other high-acuity patients. Other strategies to mitigate exposure include providing referring providers with a detailed overview of the cellular therapy treatment course, highlighting the expected duration of care at the certified treatment center, and expected date of transition back to their community. Similarly, treating institutions should formulate a long-term care plan to help guide continued management by community oncologists.
