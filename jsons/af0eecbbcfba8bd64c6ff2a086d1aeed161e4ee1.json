Whilst some had continued working for a short period prior to diagnosis, thus far there have been no cases of healthcare worker-to-patient COVID-SARS which was predominantly transmitted nosocomially in Singapore 5 , COVID-19 is predominantly acquired in the community. This presents a different challenge to preventing COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers. In Singapore, we have put in place strict staff management policies that have progressed as the infection continues its spread worldwide.",

Belingheri et al., Beyond the assistance: additional exposure situations to COVID-19 for healthcare workers, Journal of Hospital Infection. I agree with the opinions expressed regarding the need for adequate provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) 1 and the additional exposure situations to COVID-19 faced by healthcare workers 2 . COVID-19 was first detected in Singapore on 23 rd January 2020 3 , 24 days after a cluster of viral pneumonia cases subsequently identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China 4 . Having learnt painful lessons from the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 5 , Singapore was well aware that COVID-19 would hit us in no time. Preparations have long been under way to meet a new pandemic with the establishment of the 330-bed purpose built National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in 2019 and stockpiling of PPE and barrier equipment.",
