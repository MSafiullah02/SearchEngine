            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped single\u2010stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family of Coronaviridae. While initial research focused on their ability to cause enzootic infections, infections that have emerged in the past two decades demonstrate their ability to cross the species barrier and infect humans [1, 2]. The ensuing epidemics have included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the more recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 and have resulted in severe disease burden, mortality and economic disruption [3]. A novel flu\u2010like coronavirus, emerging towards the end of 2019 and subsequently named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, has been associated with an epidemic initially focused in Wuhan, China. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to the same group (\u03b2\u2010coronavirus) of coronaviruses responsible of SARS and MERS [2]. Over December 2019 and February, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spread rapidly throughout China, infecting many thousands of people and causing more than 3000 deaths [4, 5]. As a consequence, on 30 January the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the outbreak of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in China was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [6]. The influence of globalization, particularly on travel, rapidly caused the infection to spread to countries outside China, initially to neighbouring Asian countries and then to more than 120 countries around the world. As of the time of writing this Commentary, more than 200 000 individuals have contracted SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (data updated on 20 March 2020) [7]. On 11 March, the WHO declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic [6]. Currently, Italy is the country with the highest number of cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection after China, a situation which has precipitated a health and social emergency.",

            "text": "Focusing on our role within the Italian Blood System, we note that there has been no scientifically documented evidence of the transmission of coronavirus infection through the transfusion of blood components during previous epidemics. The current SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak has stimulated further discussion on this issue, particularly on the safety of blood donations in endemic countries [8]. In Italy, the transfusion network is overseen, through Regional Blood Coordinating Centres (RBCCs), by the Italian National Blood Centre (CNS), which is the Health Ministry\u2019s technical and scientific advisory body on matters related to blood and blood products. The CNS acts also as the National Competent Authority, as established by the European Commission, on blood and related issues on behalf of the same Ministry. To guarantee high standards of blood safety and sufficiency, blood donation is sourced both from public hospital\u2010based blood establishments (BEs) and licensed and accredited blood donor associations and federations\u2019 blood collection sites in a 2:1 split and is restricted to voluntary unpaid donors. The first SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 local transmitted cases in Italy were observed on 18 February 2020 and were initially clustered in a few cities in northern Italy. The Italian government, starting on 23 February and up to the date of writing this manuscript, has released eight decrees aimed at limiting the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The CNS has already released since 22 January 2020 a recommendation outlining preventative measures for the transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by transfusion of labile blood components related to travels from the People's Republic of China. On 24 February 2020, a new document was released with reference also to Italian territories. This document included the following recommendations:\nstrengthen surveillance measures on possible imported cases by questioning blood donors for travel to the People's Republic of China;strengthen surveillance measures on possible cases with contacts with documented SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection;defer from donating for 28 days:\ndonors who have been in the People's Republic of China;donors who have possibly been exposed to the risk of infection by contact with subjects with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 documented infection;donors at risk because they have transited and stopped since 1 February 2020 in the municipalities of Lombardy and Veneto regions [designated as the Zona Rossa (red zone)] identified as the initial foci of the infection in Italy;donors with a history of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (documented infection or onset of symptoms compatible with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection) who are convalescent;require donors to inform their BEs in the case of symptoms compatible with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection or in the case of diagnosis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection within 14 days after donation (post\u2010donation information);promote the implementation, at BEs and associated collection sites, of simple triage processes during the reception of donors, in order to avoid the possible spread of the virus in the waiting rooms. These included the measurement of body temperature outside the collection area. A body temperature value of 37\u00b75\u00b0C was defined as a criterion for the temporary deferral of the donor;request all the personnel working at BEs and collection sites to comply scrupulously with behavioural protocols designed to prevent the spread of respiratory infections, including SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n",

The CNS recommended that the RBCCs further implement regional patient blood management programmes, in order to conserve the blood supply, and enhance and monitor closely strategic regional blood component stocks (using information systems), in order to ensure balance and adjustment, thus minimizing any intra\u2010 or inter\u2010regional blood component shortages.",

On 2 March 2020, following the recommendations of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [9] and reflecting the decrees of the Italian government, the CNS updated the prevention measures, reducing the period of temporary deferral of donors from the previous 28 to 14 days. Along with appeals to donate in order to avoid shortages in the blood supply, the same document also included additional recommendations for the associations and federations of voluntary blood donors. These included the maintenance of safe inter\u2010individual distance (a minimum of 1 m) in waiting rooms, a careful planning of the schedule for calling up donors in order to regulate the volume of human traffic within centres, a meticulous disinfection of hands of the BE and collection sites\u2019 personnel, and similarly rigorous protocols for the sanitation and disinfection of the collection rooms. The use of masks for both BE personnel and donors was not required following the recommendations of the WHO and National Health Authorities. These measures were progressively extended to most of the cities of northern Italy (9 March 2020). Following the declaration of the government of the widespread dissemination of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in Italy, the last update of the CNS on 10 March 2020 extended these measures to the whole national territory of Italy. On 18 March, the CNS defined specific criteria for collection of plasma from convalescent subjects.",

The strategic reserve of blood kept for emergencies was not accessed.

We propose that it is possible to manage a transfusion system during this critical period, using pragmatic, prudent and evidence\u2010based measures. In our country, so far, blood donation, after an initial fall (\u221210%), has been maintained during SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 emergency, having been recognized by the government as a priority in order to maintain basic healthcare services. With the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak spreading in all European Countries, we recommend defining common European guidelines that establish screening criteria for blood donors. Such criteria need to take into account the different epidemiological situations in different countries, while establishing common principles ensuring blood safety throughout Europe.",
