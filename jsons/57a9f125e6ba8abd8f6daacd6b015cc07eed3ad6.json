These cabin hospitals serve the role of effectively quarantine and treat mild cases of patients infected with COVID-19. Each cabin hospital has pharmacists to provide services and pharmaceutical care to patients. Pharmacists also provide assistance to cabin hospitals through remote internet platforms across China. In this commentary, we describe pharmacy services at cabin hospitals to share our experiences with the international pharmacy community.",

            "text": "In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China, and the city has rapidly become the epicenter of the disease. As of March 13, 2020, there are 80,991 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, including 3180 deaths [1] . To contain the coronavirus in Wuhan, all patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are required to be admitted to healthcare facilities. However, with the rapid increase of confirmed cases, healthcare facilities quickly ran out of hospital beds and could not admit new patients including patients who also needed medical attention. To effectively contain COVID-19 at the epicenter, cabin hospitals were transformed from large space places such as convention and exhibition centers, gyms, factories, warehouses, etc., in the City of Wuhan. These hospitals can quickly admit and treat a large number of patients following established standard operational and organizational protocols. Cabin hospitals have three primary functions: (1) provide isolation to patients to block off the transmission caused by close contact with family members and the general public, (2) provide medical treatment to patients with mild diseases based on disease characteristics, and (3) monitor patient's condition closely and immediately transfer patients to designated hospitals for intensive care in the event patient's condition deteriorates.",

One of the authors of this commentary, LM, worked at two cabin hospitals in Wuhan, China, from February 4 to March 10, 2020. At cabin hospitals, pharmacists usually work between 8 and 14 h a day, 5-6 days per week.

The CNHC guidelines recommend the use of antiviral drugs (\u03b1-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, umifenovir) and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) for the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19. When considering the number of drugs needed to be stocked, pharmacists should view each drug's treatment efficacy, safety, and route of administration. For example, \u03b1-interferon is administered through aerosol inhalation requiring an atomizing device, and there is a risk of virus transmission by inhalation. Ribavirin is administered intravenously, and both lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine have more safety concerns [2] , and (3) the drug formulary should include medications for the relief and treatment of the coronavirus, as well as mitigating the symptoms of the disease such as antipyretic analgesics, antibiotics, hepatoprotective drugs, medicines for the regulation of intestinal microorganisms, digestive medications, respiratory medications, and psycho-neurological medications. Medications for patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, and asthma should be stocked to continue their treatment while in isolation, as well as resuscitation and emergency drugs. In general, the drug formulary contains approximately 100 medications for stocking (Table 1) .",

For example, at the two hospitals the author (LM) worked, there were only three pharmacists providing care for almost 1000 patients. To meet the demand for pharmacy services, pharmacists must adjust workflow to optimize operational efficiency. The following is a discussion of the measures that may be considered: (1) preparing and maintaining drug par levels for each hospital ward. Ensure drugs are replenished daily based on consumption and the demand of the ward, this will effectively reduce the frequency of pharmacy dispensing and avoid unnecessary repeated labor, and (2) change the mode of drug delivery to prevent infection and further control the spread of the disease. Personnel should not be allowed to enter and leave the ward (polluted area) at will, and this may result in the inability of drugs being delivered to the ward on time. To this end, pharmacists provide drugs to the outside of the buffer zone, and coordinate hospital and ward staff to transfer medications inside wards.",

Some patients also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia, and diarrhea. Except for a small percentage of patients requiring no treatment, most patients received antivirals and drugs for symptomatic relief. Pharmacists typically provide the following pharmaceutical care: (1) educating patients on medications taken at the hospital and upon discharge (focusing on drug administration and precautions), (2) providing necessary drug information to physicians especially concerning drugs that general practitioners are not familiar with a focus on off-label drug use, and interactions between TCMs and western medicines, and (3) performing medication reconciliation to ensure the safe transition of care. Although cabin hospitals treat patients with mild cases, some patients may also have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes. Patients' chronic medications may have to be adjusted as the cabin hospital drug formulary is relatively limited.",

These problems patients are faced with may also be a concern of being infected with the coronavirus or due to the side effects of medications.
