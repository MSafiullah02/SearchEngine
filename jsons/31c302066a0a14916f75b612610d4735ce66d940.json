High risk of exposure to healthcare workers occurs with direct contact with respiratory 21 droplets. Formal recommendations have been issued by the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation 22 (APSF) recommending that health care workers wear at minimum, an N95 mask or equivalent 23 while performing an aerosol-generating procedure with a face shield. A powered air-purifying 24 respirator (PAPR) provides superior protection and may be warranted in patients with known or 25 suspected COVID-19. PAPRs pull air through a HEPA filter (N95 grade or better) into a suit to 26 create positive pressure with air always flowing out so that the person in the suit only receives 27 filtered air, thus minimizing exposure to the person in the suit. Risk of aerosolization is greatest 28 during intubation. In addition, specific surgeries and procedures that involve the 29 nasopharynx/oropharynx may carry similar risk to surgeons and other staff in the operating 30 room. Amid this, the United States faces shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) [1]. 31 In addition, surgeons who use loupes and headlights have difficulty using these in conjunction 32 with face shields.

The air then passes through the 44 blue AAMI Class 4 material on the sides of the hood. A fan mounted in the top of the helmet 45 drives this flow. While Class 4 material provides the highest level of protection against 46 pathogens [5], the Class 3 material may allow some pathogens to pass through. Helmet systems 47 were used in conjunction with goggles and N95 masks during the 2003 SARS outbreak as using the helmet systems alone did not filter enough particles (0.02-1\u03bcm diameter) to meet the standard 49 for PAPRs [6]. While this system is not intended as a respirator, a novel solution has been 50 proposed with adaptation of the standard helmet system given the shortage of PAPRs and 51 potential shortage of N95 masks.

The manifold sits over the (previously open) intake fan and creates a 62 sealed air path directly to the two mounted filters. The manifold is created from a Duke design 63 that is then 3D printed (additive manufacturing) to arrive at the final component. We used 64 Formlabs printers and their 'Durable' material for this new part. The engineering team worked to 65quickly design a robust manifold by using 3D printing(Figure 3). The first single-port design 66 was created on 3/22/2020(Figure 4). The single-port design had insufficient flow and choking at 67 the fan but proved the concept, so we went to a two-port design on 3/24/2020 (Figure 5).

We created a novel 109 design that modifies a Stryker Flyte helmet to filter intake air into the helmet to reduce the110 likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare providers. This product is especially 111 useful for health care providers involved in airway management or higher risk 112 surgeries/procedures in COVID-19 suspected or positive patients. We recognize that these 113 modifications constitute off-label use of the device and the introduction of new elements/features. Given the emergent circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and shortage 115 of PAPR devices, we propose that the risk of using this device are small in comparison to the 116 risk of COVID-19 transmission. We encourage physicians and other healthcare workers to weigh 117 these risks prior to use of the device.",

We currently have ongoing production of these manifolds to use with this 133 helmet.
