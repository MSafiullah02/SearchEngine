We witnessed the contribution of faster travel to the spread of disease recently during the 2010 flu pandemic. Apart from the legal movement of a population, mass illegal immigration also poses a significant problem in certain parts of the world \u2013 e.g. in Greece \u2013 in relation to the spread of a disease or re-emergence of old diseases like malaria or tuberculosis.
