The prospect of variation in sensitivity to antivirals is also an important reason to investigate each novel strain comprehensively, as is the chance that infection by specific HRV species could be associated with more severe illness or particular pre-existing conditions. Disappointingly, the possibility that discrete HRV strains exist as distinct viral entities is not accounted for in asymptomatic control populations because strain identification is not routinely conducted. As a consequence elevated prominence is, by default, assigned to HRVs as if to a single virus.",

The most recent significant healthcare impact attributed to HRVs was the 2009 H1N1v influenza pandemic when HRVs were the most common viruses detected among patients qualifying, but laboratory-negative for, pandemic virus testing.33 Similar findings were described during the SARS-CoV outbreak.34 A lack of viral sequence data weakens our differential diagnostic and overall detection capabilities which limits our ability to define epidemiological features as well as the occurrence of strain-, or species-specific clinical outcomes and potentially differentiating genetic features. Due to the retrospective nature of our study, no temporally comparable control population was available for testing. This is a limitation among most other HRV studies as is the current inability to culture the newly identified HRVs. When a control population is included however, strain typing is usually not conducted and so a higher proportion of asymptomatic illness is attributed to all HRVs as a total group. Additionally, because we and others cannot fulfil Koch's postulates for the currently unculturable HRV-Cs, the clinical observations cannot be specifically associated with the PCR-determined presence of HRVC-QCE RNA. Our findings highlight the need to better understand the genomics, taxonomy, epidemiology and clinical impact of the newly identified HRV strains to accurately quantify the scope of their clinical impact as distinct respiratory viruses.",
