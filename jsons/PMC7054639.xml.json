            "text": "Urinary tract obstruction is a common urological condition observed in both children and adults. Congenital urinary tract obstruction leading to obstructive uropathy is the second most common cause of end-stage renal disease in children (1). Several solid organ malignancies (e.g., bladder, cervix, and prostate cancers) can induce obstructive urine flow from both kidneys, leading to acute kidney injury (4). Urinary tract obstruction alters renal blood flow and impairs glomerular filtration and tubular function (2). In humans, massive water diuresis and salt wasting, symptoms of postobstructive diuresis, have been observed after the release of bladder outlet obstruction caused by prostrate carcinoma (55). Likewise, a 24-h bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO) rat model has shown similar effects immediately after the release of obstruction, and postobstructive diuresis persisted for 7 days (14). Various animal studies have investigated several of the underlying molecular mechanisms of postobstructive diuresis. For example, in 24-h unilateral urinary tract obstruction (UUO) and BUO models, decreased levels of water channel proteins [aquaporin (AQP)2, AQP3, and AQP4], located in the collecting duct (CD) (1, 14, 21), and urea transporters (UT-A1, UT-A2, and UT-B) (24), located in the inner medullary CD (IMCD), are involved in the development and maintenance of urinary concentration defects after obstruction and the release of obstruction. In addition, 24-h UUO- and BUO-induced reductions in major Na+ channels likely contribute to salt wasting during postobstructive diuresis (25\u201327).",

            "text": "The mechanisms responsible for the alterations in various transport proteins are beginning to be unraveled. In a 48-h BUO model, arginine vasopressin, a major modulator of AQPs and urea transporters, not only fails to increase but in fact decreases levels of AQPs (AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4), the type 2 vasopressin receptor (V2R), cAMP, and adenylyl cyclase type VI in the renal medulla (21). PGE2, which antagonizes arginine vasopressin effects on water permeability and Na+ transport in the CD, and the major enzyme responsible for its production (46), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), are increased in the inner medulla (IM) of rats at 6 and 12 h after BUO, respectively (39). A previous study (36) in COX-2 knockout mice has confirmed a role of COX-2-derived prostaglandins in postobstructive diuresis. The renin-angiotensin system is also involved in BUO pathology, as angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockage attenuated V2R, AQP2, and phospho-Ser256 AQP2 reductions 24 h after BUO (18). Despite these inroads, studies focusing on the initial mechanisms of altered regulation of AQP2 are limited. A time course study of BUO showed that reduced V2R levels observed at 12-h BUO are not responsible for the reduction of AQP2 mRNA detected at 2-h BUO (49). Furthermore, in a 12-h BUO model, AQP2 and phospho-Ser261 AQP2 colocalized with early endosomal and lysosomal markers, indicating a potential role of the lysosomal pathway in AQP2 degradation (49).",

            "text": "Recently, our group has demonstrated that autophagic degradation of AQP2 in the IMCD is responsible for the development of a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) phenotype in rats with hypokalemia (20) and hypercalcemia (19). Autophagy is a conserved biological process that plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis by removal of damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and other macromolecules and subsequent transport of these components to the lysosome for degradation followed by reuse of some metabolites (23). As a prosurvival mechanism, autophagy is elevated in response to various cellular stresses, e.g., oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Autophagy eliminating damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) is necessary to maintain quality control of mitochondria and prevents apoptosis since damaged mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release proapoptotic factors (42). Autophagy protects cells from apoptosis; however, with prolonged stress, apoptosis may overwhelm the protective effect of autophagy (13). The mechanism by which hypokalemia and hypercalcemia stimulate autophagy in the IMCD remains unclear. Alteration of extracellular K+ and Ca2+ levels could change mitochondrial K+ and Ca2+ levels, resulting in decreased ATP production (41, 52). Given the evidence of gross mitochondrial damage in the IMCD of hypokalemic rats and downregulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins in the IMCD of hypercalcemic rats, we speculated that mitochondrial damage might activate autophagy and mitophagy in both NDI models (19, 20).",

            "text": "ER stress is known to induce autophagy in the kidney (5). In eukaryotic cells, the ER is responsible for protein synthesis, folding, and degradation, known as ER proteostasis, to maintain protein quality control. Various stresses, including oxidative stress, cause accumulation of unfolded and/or misfolded proteins in the ER, inducing disruption of ER proteostasis (ER stress). ER stress activates the three major signal transducers that induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway (45). The UPR pathway initiates signaling events, including expression of chaperones, attenuation of protein translation, and degradation of unfolded proteins, to avoid irreversible cellular damage. In addition, the UPR pathway also regulates ER contacts with other organelles and the plasma membrane, with ER stress altering their functions (44, 45). The UPR pathway responds to ER stress in a binary fashion, depending on severity (17). Under mild stress, the adaptive branch of the UPR pathway promotes cell survival; however, under severe or prolonged stress, the apoptotic UPR pathway is emphasized, followed by cell death (17). In both cases, ER stress induces swollen mitochondria, autophagy, and mitophagy (28). Indeed, elevation of markers for oxidative stress, ER stress, and ER-associated apoptotic proteins are observed in whole kidney tissue after 4 h of UUO, followed by an elevation of apoptosis markers (Bax/Bcl2 ratio and caspase-3) 4 h later (58). Recently, we showed that the COOH terminus of heat shock complex 70-interacting protein, which has a protective role in the UPR during ER stress, interacts with AQP2 and facilitates its degradation (56).",

Proteomics were initially used to investigate protein changes in the IMCD at the early onset of AQP2 downregulation in a 4-h BUO model. Subsequent immunofluorescence and electron microscopy imaging demonstrated enlargement of the ER lumen, swollen mitochondria, and mitophagy, which were associated with increased autophagic degradation of AQP2 and other critical protein targets in the IMCD. Together, our data show a key role of autophagy in the pathology of BUO.",

Rats had free access to water and to a standard rodent diet. Rats were randomly assigned to the following two groups for each protocol: 4 h of BUO and sham operation (sham) control. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b0C during surgery. Through a midabdominal incision, both upper parts of the ureter were ligated using 3-0 silk in four rats. Rats in the sham control group were prepared in parallel with the 4-h BUO group. Rats were allowed to recover after surgery in metabolic cages. We collected urine dripping from the urethra of sham control rats for osmolality measurement. Four hours after the operation, rats were decapitated using a guillotine while conscious to avoid stress-induced arginine vasopressin secretion that might alter the IMCD protein abundance.",

A total of 215 proteins changed significantly in the IMCD of BUO rats compared with sham rats (see Supplemental Data available online at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9731345.v1). Of these, 140 proteins were significantly decreased in abundance, whereas 75 proteins were significantly increased. The complete list of protein quantifications along with associated GO terms are provided in a publicly accessible online database (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/BUO/). The DAVID bioinformatics resource was used to further investigate the classes of proteins that exhibited a significant change. Highly represented annotations were grouped into clusters.

A high degree of colocalization of AQP2 with LC3 and Lamp1 was detected in BUO IMCDs (Fig. 3, A\u2013C). Double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy confirmed colocalization of AQP2 with both LC3 (autophagosome marker) and cathepsin D (lysosomal marker; Fig. 2, K and L). Furthermore, AQP2 was colocalized with various other downregulated proteins in a punctate pattern, including RhoA and Cttn (Fig. 4), and representative proteins of cell-cell adhesion [catenin-\u03b21 (Ctnnb1) and integrin-\u03b21 (Itgb1)], cell-cell adherens junction [vinculin (Vcl) and erm], and mitochondrial inner membrane [ATP synthase F1 subunit-\u03b1 (ATP5a)] (Fig. 5 and Supplemental Fig. S2). No colocalization of AQP2 with these proteins was observed in IMCDs of sham rats. These findings support that the process of autophagy is involved in downregulation of these groups of proteins in BUO.",

Rats with BUO were unable to concentrate urine compared with sham rats (Supplemental Table S3). Their IMCD cells became condensed and severely deformed after 10-h BUO (Fig. 6A). Compared with the 4-h BUO condition, we observed disruption of the adherens junctions, swelling and rupture of mitochondrial membranes, enlargement of ER lumens, rupture of the nuclear membrane, and chromatin condensation, indicating the initiation of the apoptosis pathway in IMCD cells after 10-h BUO (Fig. 6, B\u2013D). Even more extreme effects were seen at 24-h BUO, with high levels of cell separation, distortion, and shrinkage, disappearance of the epithelial membrane, and appearance of lipid droplets as well as condensation of nuclear chromatin (pyknosis) and rupture of the nuclear membrane, all of which are indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 6, E\u2013H). As expected, significant downregulation of AQP2 and RhoA, a cell-cell adhesion representative, was observed in the IM after 10- and 24-h BUO (Fig. 7, A\u2013E). Interestingly, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a marker of DNA breakage and late apoptosis (53), was significantly upregulated in the IM as early as 4 h after BUO, with continued upregulation at 10 h after BUO (Fig. 7, F\u2013H); however, the initial marker of apoptosis cleaved caspase-9 was not significantly upregulated (Fig. 8, A\u2013B). Such an expression pattern, combined with oxidative stress, autophagy, and the absence of apoptotic bodies, is indicative of caspase-free regulated cell death (53). In agreement with IMCD morphology, cleaved PARP was still significantly upregulated, along with cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-6 and AQP2 downregulation, at 24-h BUO compared with sham (Figs. 7C and 8, C and F).",

It has been known for more than six decades that pronounced urinary water and Na+ loss are postobstruction features (55). However, the initial molecular mechanisms of postobstructive diuresis remain incompletely understood. Although several studies have examined BUO at 2\u201348 h, they have focused on a limited number of target molecules in the kidney (18, 21, 36, 38, 39, 49). Because a previous study (49) of BUO observed decreased phosphorylation of AQP2 at 6 h postobstruction followed by a total AQP2 protein reduction at 12 h after BUO, we focused on the initial pathogenesis of obstructive diuresis by investigating proteomic changes that occur at 4 h of BUO. Our use of an unbiased systems approach allowed us to generate the most detailed view to date of the early effects of BUO.",

Supporting this, after 4 h of BUO, AQP2 in IMCD cells was sequestered in autophagosomes/lysosomes. The urea transporter UT-A1 is also expressed exclusively in IMCD cells and is essential for urine concentration (11). Although we did not identify any UT-A1 peptides in our proteomic analysis, we observed that UT-A1 colocalized with AQP2 and lysosomal markers in the kidney of BUO rats (Supplemental Fig. S3). Because decreased abundance of AQP2 would be sufficient to produce the urinary concentrating defect in BUO, it is likely that autophagy is the mechanism for AQP2 downregulation and subsequent development of postobstructive diuresis. However, to formally demonstrate that autophagy leads directly to AQP2 degradation, it would be necessary to show that inhibition of autophagy prevents AQP2 degradation. The use of a renal-collecting, tubule-specific, autophagy-related gene knockout mouse model would be required to assess this.",

This is demonstrated in many renal tubular injury models, including a progressive renal fibrosis model of 3-day UUO (22). In addition, a previous study (9) demonstrated that autophagy suppressed renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a 7-day UUO model using LC3\u2212/\u2212 and beclin 1 heterozygous mice. More recently, a study by Nam et al. (33) demonstrated that autophagy attenuates tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a 7-day UUO model using renal distal, tubule-specific, autophagy related gene 7 knockout mice. However, the BUO model induced significantly higher intrarenal hydrostatic pressure than a UUO model at 24 h of obstruction (57). This level of severity may result in activation of an apoptotic response versus a prosurvival response, as demonstrated by upregulated PARP in the IM at 4 h of BUO in this study. An in vitro proteomic study in which rat proximal tubular cells were periodically stretched over 24 h as an obstruction mimic showed similar activation of a proapoptotic response in addition to downregulation of cytoskeletal proteins and tight and adherens junction proteins (40).",

Our observation that autophagic degradation of cell-cell adhesion proteins is common between hypokalemia and hypercalcemia-induced NDI; also, BUO is intriguing and supports an interplay of autophagy and epithelial junctions, e.g., tight junctions, gap junctions, and adherens junctions, during pathological conditions, e.g., starvation (34).

For example, under nutrient starvation, autophagy enhances intestinal tight junction barrier function and reduces the permeability of ions and small-sized solutes by degradation of pore-forming claudin-2 (35).",

            "text": "The enlargement of the ER lumen and swollen mitochondria identified in IMCD cells after 4-h BUO are unique to the BUO model relative to other models we have studied with NDI (19, 20). These distinct findings may represent more severe IMCD stress in BUO than the other models. Under moderate stress, ER chaperones involved in the adaptive UPR pathway are upregulated (28); however, these proteins are downregulated under severe stress via the apoptotic UPR pathway (28). Our results are in parallel with the latter case, with significant reductions in four of seven ER chaperones [Hyou1, Hspa5, DnaJ heat shock protein family member B11 (Dnajb11), and Calr] involved in the UPR pathway. Hyou1 and Hspa5 have been previously shown to respond to mild and severe stress in renal tubules (28). The UPR pathway also regulates morphological changes to the ER, which may subsequently affect mitochondrial structure and function via altered mitochondria-associated ER membrane proteins, e.g., mitofusin-2 and protein kinase R-like kinase (PERK) (32). Disruption of adherens junctions was also demonstrated in a model of ER stress via chemical induction and, ultimately, apoptosis in HK-2 cells (8). This suggests an interplay between ER stress and autophagy responses on cell-cell adhesion molecules. Although the signaling pathway inducing autophagic AQP2 degradation after 4-h BUO remains unknown, we observed evidence of ER stress concurrent with swollen mitochondria and mitophagy in the IMCD. Therefore, well-established signaling pathways (e.g., PKR-like ER kinase) involved in cross-talk of ER stress-mediated autophagy (48) may play major roles in AQP2 degradation in this model. Meanwhile, the COOH terminus of heat shock complex 70-interacting protein interacting with AQP2 (56) may facilitate AQP2 degradation via lysosomal and/or ER-associated protein degradation pathways during ER stress.",
