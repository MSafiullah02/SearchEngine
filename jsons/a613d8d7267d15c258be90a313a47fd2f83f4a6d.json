We have shown previously that lower respiratory tract symptoms, airflow obstruction, and neutrophilic airway inflammation were increased in experimental RV-induced asthma exacerbations. Objectives We hypothesized that neutrophil-related CXC chemokines and antimicrobial peptides are increased and related to clinical, virologic, and pathologic outcomes in RV-induced exacerbations of asthma. Methods Protein levels of antimicrobial peptides (SLPI, HNP 1-3, elafin, and LL-37) and neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1/GRO-a, CXCL2/GRO-b, CXCL5/ENA-78, CXCL6/GCP-2, CXCL7/NAP-2, and CXCL8/IL-8) were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 10 asthmatics and 15 normal controls taken before, at day four during and 6 weeks post-experimental infection. Results BAL HNP 1-3 and Elafin were higher, CXCL7/NAP-2 was lower in asthmatics compared with controls at day 4 (P = 0.035, P = 0.048, and P = 0.025, respectively). BAL HNP 1-3 and CXCL8/IL-8 were increased during infection (P = 0.003 and P = 0.011, respectively). There was a trend to increased BAL neutrophils at day 4 compared with baseline (P = 0.076).

Respiratory viruses are the most frequent pathogens, and human RVs are most frequently detected [2, 3] . It has been shown that during naturally occurring virus-induced asthma exacerbations, neutrophils are recruited into the airways as part of the immune defence [8] . The influx of neutrophils correlates with symptoms and parameters of airways obstruction such as FEV 1 [19] . Accordingly, we observed in our experimental model higher values of BAL neutrophils at day 4 after intranasal experimental infection. However, these changes were moderate, probably due to the small number of patients and the rather mild severity of the induced asthma exacerbations. Recruitment into this intensive and burdensome study was difficult resulting in small numbers of patients. Moreover, also due to ethical constraints, experimental exacerbations had to be mild in character. The results presented are thus also consequences of these requirements. Symptoms and reductions in FEV 1 were significantly greater in asthmatics compared with controls as previously reported [5] . It has been shown before that 4 days after experimental RV infection, the inflammatory response of the upper airways is increased which is associated with increased symptoms and airways obstruction in asthmatics [20] . We report that the increase in neutrophils is associated with higher HNP 1-3 levels. This suggests that neutrophils could be the major source of HNP 1-3. To our knowledge, the only other cell type for which HNP 1-3 expression has been shown is cd-CD 8 cells in blood [21] . Hence, we do not expect that there are any other relevant cellular sources of HNP 1-3 than neutrophils in BAL. In favour of this is also the fact that CXCL8/IL-8 was the only chemokine significantly increased at day 4 in asthmatics. It has been shown that HNP 1-3 can induce CXCL8/IL-8 [22] , which may explain to a certain degree the significantly higher levels observed at day 4 [5] . Significantly higher levels of CXCL8/IL-8 and a trend for higher CXCL1/GRO-a in BAL at day 4 were related to high virus load measured in nasal lavage. This may be a result of increased induction of CXCL8/IL-8 and CXCL1/GRO-a in asthmatics by RVs. It has been shown in vitro that RV infection of human respiratory epithelial cell line significantly increases CXCL8/IL-8 [23] . Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the intramuscular injection of synthetic HNP1 induces the transcript expression of genes encoding both pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) and the chemokine CXCL8/IL-8. Furthermore, HNP1 showed chemotactic capacity towards leucocytes [24] .

Antimicrobial peptides such as HNP 1-3 are important effector molecules of neutrophils. It was suggested that a-defensins (HNP 1-3) cannot directly inactivate non-enveloped viruses such as RVs [10] . However, recent research showed that this is not completely true. It was shown that human a-defensins (HD-5) can block adenovirus uncoating [29] . Moreover, it is known that HNP 1-3 are potent antagonists of infection by both cutaneous and mucosal papillomavirus types by blocking virion escape from endocytic vesicles [30] . Thus, HNP 1-3 do have direct antiviral properties against non-enveloped viruses and might also have direct antiviral properties against RV infection. In addition, HNP 1-3 might have indirect antiviral effects. They have recently been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication even when added 12 h postinfection [31] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that HNP1 can affect the ability of adenoviruses to infect epithelial cells [32] . a-defensins have chemoattractant properties towards both CD8 + and CD4 + /CD45RA + T cells [33] . Increased levels of a-defensins during viral infection could therefore recruit both CD4 + and CD8 + cells to the airways. This may enhance antiviral immunity as it has been shown in a variety of murine models that HNPs enhance antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity [34] [35] [36] .

The major strength of this study is the study design. Experimental RV infection in humans provides an excellent model of virus-induced asthma under controlled conditions including application of a standard dose of a single virus serotype and standardized clinical data collection. Invasive sampling can be carried out under controlled conditions repeatedly and at accurately defined time points. However, this elaborate study design is extremely labour-intensive which accounts for limitation of number of subjects that can be included in such a study. Thus, subject numbers have to be small. For safety reasons, only mild asthmatics could be included into the study. This limits the ability to study more severe forms of asthma. Another important aspect is that BAL sampling time points had to be limited to 3 due to the invasive character of this investigation, and it seems possible that the time points chosen (baseline, 4 days and 6 weeks after experimental infection) do not correspond to the peak changes in CXC chemokine and/ or AMP expression. Moreover, the analysis of soluble markers in respiratory secretions is complex because of dilution, modification, and degradation. Nevertheless, we found significant differences between asthmatics and normal controls which results from meticulous patient characterization before inclusion. Regarding in vitro findings and preliminary in vivo data, our results deliver direct evidence that RV infections increase levels of a-defensins in the airways. This has been assumed as RV infections lead to marked neutrophil infiltration and degranulation in the airways [11, 39] .
