            "text": "The baculovirus (BV) expression vector system (BEVS) is of great interest for the production of recombinant proteins in a wide range of fields\u2014from basic science research to the development of biomedical applications and the production of bio-insecticides (Felberbaum, 2015, Kost et al., 2005, Mehalko and Esposito, 2016, Shang et al., 2017). The production of recombinant proteins in BEVS is greatly affected by the characteristics and kinetics of the viral infection process\u2014including, for instance, the multiplicity of infection (MOI), time of infection (TOI), cell cycle, cell line selection, and culture state (Ge et al., 2014, Kioukia et al., 1995, Lecina et al., 2006, Licari and Bailey, 1992, Monteiro et al., 2017, Monteiro et al., 2014, Monterio et al., 2016, Nwe et al., 2006, Saito et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2005, Enden et al., 2005), but the early events of viral infection, such as the attachment of virions to their receptors and the kinetics of their entry into the cell, are still not entirely understood. This gap hampers the development of efficient and specific genetically engineered proteins and gene therapy vectors based on BV \u2013 a goal that has lately gained much interest (Licari and Bailey, 1992, Felberbaum, 2015, Kost et al., 2005, Mehalko and Esposito, 2016, Shang et al., 2017). Since baculovirus was used for efficient gene transfer to mammalian cells in the 1990s (Boyce and Bucher, 1996, Hofmann et al., 1995), several effective baculovirus-based gene therapy vectors had been created and tested, demonstrating favorable therapeutic efficacy in laboratory and preclinical phase studies (Ono et al., 2018, Mansouri and Berger, 2018, Makkonen et al., 2015, Van Oers et al., 2015). Although the entry processes and the mechanisms involving BVs infection of insect cells or transduction of mammalian cells remain poorly understood, it has been shown that a similar mechanism may mediate GP64 binding to permissive host cells (Blissard and Theilmann, 2018, Oflynn et al., 2012, Dong and Blissard, 2012) and that BVs enter insect and mammalian cells through a clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Kataoka et al., 2012, Long et al., 2006). Thus, comprehensively characterizing the kinetics underlying the early steps of BVs infection of insect cells is crucial both for improving the production of recombinant proteins in insect cells and for designing therapy vectors and enhancing gene transduction efficacy in therapeutic studies.",

Quantitative models were also employed to simulate the infection dynamics of infectious diseases. Padmanabhan and Dixit (2011) (Padmanabhan and Dixit, 2011) constructed a kinetic model of hepatitis C virus (HCV) which accounted explicitly for the dependence of HCV entry target cells on CD81 expression. Iwami et al. (2012) (Iwami et al., 2012) optimized a mathematical model to describe the kinetics of the simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection which improved the understanding of SHIV and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 pathogenesis. Such models, and the virtual experiments that they facilitate, are useful for interpreting the mechanistic aspects of the viral infection process and may save time, manpower, and physical resources in predicting their outcomes. The main purpose of the current study was to construct such a model, focusing on the early stages of a high-MOI BV infection of insect cells (Zhang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 1996), based on and tested against experimental results.",

It disregards the effect of non-infective viral mutants which might enter the cell without infecting it. It also does not address the effectiveness of infection, which may vary depending on the elapsed storage time, mainly due to viral aggregation within the viral stocks (Jorio et al., 2006, Shen et al., 2002). As we used the same storage time in all experiments, particle aggregation did not affect the measured results. Consequently, we disregarded storage time in our model. Based on detailed and accurate measurements, our model enhances our understanding of the early BV infection process and can be potentially extended to describe the early stages of other infection processes, such as gene delivery by viruses in mammalian cells. It also provides a basis for modelling the production of foreign proteins. The present model is a first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a more elaborated model of the production process, aimed at saving time, manpower, and physical resources.",

To experimentally monitor the early stages of the infection process and detect infection in cells to which virions attach, we directly tracked GP64\u2014the major envelope protein of the BV, which plays a crucial role in the early stages of infection. GP64 is essential for the attachment of virions to cells in a culture and for their transport between cells in infected tissues (Monsma et al., 1996), as it is involved in the binding of the virions to host cell receptors (Hefferon et al., 1999) and acts to locally reduce the membrane pH, which triggers membrane fusion. Once the virus has entered the cell by endocytosis, GP64 is necessary for stripping the nucleocapsid from its capsid proteins and for releasing the virion into the cytosol (Kingsley et al., 1999, Markovic et al., 1998, Plonsky et al., 1999). To label GP64 specifically and thereby detect only infected cells, we used the monoclonal antibody AcV1, which binds to GP64 but does not reduce its ability to attach to cells (Kataoka et al., 2012, Hohmann and Faulkner, 1983, Volkman and Goldsmith, 1985, Dhungel et al., 2013, Granio et al., 2009). To differentiate between virions that are attached to the cell surface from those that have already entered it, we either permeabilized the cells or left them intact (see methods) assuming that AcV1 labeled BVs attaches to the cell surface in both permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells, but it penetrates only into permeabilized cells. Thus, cells can be categorized according to the following criteria: cells carrying viruses on their surface only, cells carrying viruses both on their surface and in their interior, and cells carrying virions only in their interior (where in the latter all the attachment sites have been used and all the virions have made their ingress into the cells). Two types of measurements were done on each sample, rendering different readings. Figure 2\nshows diagrammatically which cells are detected in each reading. AcV1, conjugated with a fluorescent PE",

For MOIs = 114, 219, and 421, we found N = 52.8, 55.3, and 58 attachment sites per cell, respectively. In principle it is accepted here that N is a property of the cell, which means that a cell has finite attachment sites that should be identical for all cells and under all conditions. In our experimental results we found a small difference between the three MOIs, with a standard deviation lower than 5% for a mean N of 55, which may be considered as experimentally acceptable. Thus, we suggest usingN=55 for Autographa californica at any MOI. When this model is applied to anti-tumor therapy with baculovirus vectors, N would be the basis for calculating the upper limit of viral concentration required to deliver a foreign gene to target cells. The optimal dosage per cell should be between zero and N. The desired dose per cell (MOI) can be defined as that which maximizes the expectancy of treated cells with minimal costs.",

This maximum will be explained below in terms of the balance between virus attachment and virus internalization. In contrast, the percentage of the infected cells, as evaluated when permeabilizing reagents were used in the analysis, Cip, increased monotonically, reached a maximum of 97%, and then, either remained unchanged, or moderately increased to a plateau. This effect was observed with only minor differences between the three examined MOIs (although higher MOIs resulted in a slightly higher Cip), suggesting that almost all cells were infected by or before approximately 6 hpi. Cipdenotes the number of infected cells carrying virions on their surface and/or their interior. Cip is an essential indicator in pathopoiesis of viruses. The higher Cip, the severe the incidence of diseases. In the early stage of virus infection, the rate of change of Cipis similar to the transduction dynamics of target cells with viral vectors in an ex vivo therapy. In the same way the transduction efficiency of viral vectors plays a fundamental role in improving the therapeutic efficacy of a gene therapy program (Asad et al., 2017, Kalesnykas et al., 2017, Sinn et al., 2017, Espirituramirez et al., 2018); Cipcould be considered a key parameter in gene therapy treatment based on viral vectors.",

(4), can be obtained by using the difference between the two above mentioned variables, Cid, which represents the concentration of the infected non-permeabilized cells that have already internalized all the attached virions. The relationship between virion internalization and Cid is by no means simple. The internalization rate, ri, is the result of a very large number of attachment events of viruses to cells. At a given time, the states of these cells vary considerably, ranging from non-infected (a very small fraction) to infected cells that already have attached various numbers of virions, up to N. The darkening of any detected cell occurs only after the cell has accumulated N attachment events and a time te has passed since the last such event. Considering the multiple possibilities in the process of occupying a cell to its maximum capacity N, two extreme patterns can be imagined: in one extreme, the distribution of virions among the cells is completely homogeneous: at any point in time, the number of virions in each cell is identical and, consequently, no cell darkening is observed until the very final stages of the process. In such a case, the profile of Cidt would be zero until the very end of the process. On the other extreme, the virions are distributed among the cells in an orderly fashion, such that attachment to a new cell does not occur before the previously infected cell is fully saturated, i.e., at any time t\u2a7ete,\\;Cidt=xt-teN\n",

Here the barred variables are the experimentally measured variables, i is the time index; Wc=C0-1 and Wx=1/C0\u00d7N are the scaling factors. Clearly, the model is sensitive to changes in kw. On the other hand, the general agreement between the fitted values and the respective experimental values, suggests that the assumptions on which the mechanistic model is based on are satisfactory. In particular the homogeneity of te also supports this assertion. However, both te and kw are practically independent of the concentration of virions in the medium. The results for te, which are within the range of time usually observed in cell infection processes, confirm our assumption that te can be related to as a constant. The fact that all examined MOIs render the same te indicates that the internalization process is a property dependent on biological processes occurring on the cell surface and in its interior regardless of the virus concentration in the medium. Hefferon et al. (1999) (Hefferon et al., 1999) found that Orgyia pseudotsugata multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (OpMNPV) virions entered Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with a half-time of approximately 12.5 minutes. Their results differed from the results in the current study with the AcMNPV-Sf9 system shown in Table 2. This indicates that different Baculovirus may have different internalization half-time value. Since the internalization time for each specific virus-host system is expected to be a characteristic constant, it seems that viral vectors with shorter internalization times would have some advantages in gene therapy, since they enter host cells more rapidly while the cells are robust. Therefore, the estimation of the internalization time for any potential virus-host combinations may be very important. The very low value of the constant kw indicates that the actual accumulation rate of dark cells dCid/dtis substantially lower than the floor function shown in Eq. (19), and yet follows a similar pattern, given the quality of the fit.",
