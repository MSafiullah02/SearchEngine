            "text": "Considerable shifts in the spectrum of bacterial infections have occurred over time as a result of antimicrobial prophylaxis therapy with more severely mucotoxic drugs [23] and the widespread use of intravascular catheters. Until the late 1980s, Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms were equally distributed as causes of bloodstream infections. The introduction of quinolone prophylaxis was associated with a significant reduction in Gram-negative infections [24] but at the cost of an increase in infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. A reemergence of bacteremia by resistant Gram-negative organisms has been recently observed [25\u201327] including quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [28], extended-spectrum c-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., others) [29], multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, and others [30]. Infections by resistant Gram-positive organisms have also been noted with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and nosocomial and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [31, 32]. A more serious problem in neutropenic patients with leukemia is the marked increase in Clostridium difficile colitis [33, 34]. In a retrospective study in 242 autologous HSCT recipients, 157 developed diarrhea between 1 week before and 30 days after HSCT, and 135 were tested for C. difficile toxin A. A diagnosis of C. difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) was made in 21 subjects (15.5 %) and occurred both before (4 patients) and after (17 patients) transplant. Patients receiving mobilization with paclitaxel and growth factor were at lower risk for CDAD compared with patients mobilized with growth factors with or without cyclophosphamide. Receipt of vancomycin or cephalosporins were risk factors for CDAD [35].",

With the introduction of fluconazole prophylaxis, the incidence of candidiasis decreased dramatically, with a shift in species distribution; fewer infections due to C. albicans and C. tropicalis, but increased infections caused by C. glabrata and C. krusei [38]. This may be illustrated by three epidemiologic studies. A prospective study of 16,200 HSCTs (autologous and allogeneic) in 23 centers in the USA (Transnet database) reported 217 cases of invasive candidiasis (1.3 %). C. glabrata was the most frequent species, accounting for 32 % of cases. Invasive candidiasis was diagnosed within 30 days after autologous HSCT in 66 % of cases, and within 4 months in 74 % of cases [39]. In a retrospective study involving 11 centers in Italy, only 16 cases of invasive candidiasis were reported among 1979 autologous HSCTs (0.8 %). Eight of the 16 cases were caused by C. glabrata (n = 5) or C. krusei (n = 3) [40].",

This group is represented by patients with lymphoma previously treated with purine analogues [41] and heavily pretreated myeloma patients [42]. We recently analyzed a cohort of 113 patients with multiple myeloma who developed invasive aspergillosis (data not published). Sixty-three episodes occurred after autologous HSCT, at a median of 16 days after transplant. In 29 of the 63 episodes (46 %), invasive aspergillosis occurred in the pre-engraftment period. Most patients had relapsed myeloma, had been heavily pretreated, and had received high doses of corticosteroids (median cumulative dose in the last 60 days of 1,380 mg patients, prednisone equivalent).",
