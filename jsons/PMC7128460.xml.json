Although the performances of these assays have been improved, false positive results may be observed.

The child was immediately hospitalized. One fecal specimen was collected at the hospital admission day and derived to the viral gastroenteritis unit, Instituto de Virolog\u00eda \u201cDr. J.M. Vanella\u201d, C\u00f3rdoba, for viral diagnosis, with a report that no white blood cells in the direct stool sample examination was observed. The fecal specimen was processed the same day, following the manufactured instructions, by a one-step membrane test based on immunochromatographic assays (ICA) (Diarlex MB, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) for rotavirus and adenovirus antigen detection. The test resulted positive for both viruses therefore it was informed as a rotavirus\u2013adenovirus dual infection. Although manufacturer's instructions indicate that the relative intensities of the lines seen in the result window are irrelevant to the test result, we decided to re-test the stool sample because the rotavirus slightly weak line revealed. The specimen was assayed by two different EIAs (Rotazyme II, Abbot Laboratories, Diagnostics Division, Abbott Park, IL 60064 and Pathfinder\u2122 Rotavirus, Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, France) rendering negative and low positive photometric results respectively. The discordant results compelled us to restate about the ethiology of the child infection. In order to achieve a more reliable diagnosis, the specimen was assayed by the rotavirus reference assay, that is PAGE, and revealed by silver stain (Herring et al., 1982, Laemmli, 1970). The electrophoretic pattern showed an RNA migration of 10 double stranded segments (three large, three medium and four small) which the characteristic genomic reovirus profile.",

Nevertheless, it could not be presumed that rotavirus was present in the stool sample at a very low concentration because the two techniques that rendered negative results (Rotazyme II and PAGE) are less sensitive than the monoclonal EIA. Thereby, the sample was assayed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplified directly from stool specimen the rotavirus gene segment coding for the major outer capsid glycoprotein VP 7. Rotavirus double-stranded RNA was extracted from the stool according to Boom's method (Boom et al., 1990) and used as the template for reverse transcription, which was then amplified using the Taq polymerase, according to Gouvea method (Gouvea et al., 1994). The result revealed that no rotavirus was found in the stool specimen.",
