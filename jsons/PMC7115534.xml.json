They are widely distributed in animals, plants and microorganisms [43], [15] and have attracted great interest due to their various biological activities, such as cell agglutination [21], anti-tumor [27], immunomodulatory [40], antifungal [17], antiviral [51] and anti-insect activities [36]. It has been reported that a great number of lectins (e.g., mistletoe lectin, Concanavalin A (ConA), and Polygonatum cyrtonema lectin can induce apoptosis of tumor cells) [6], [39], [30]. Therefore, plant lectins have already been adopted for alternative tumor therapy in Europe for several years [42].",

In China, Clematis armandii and C. montana called \u201cmu tong\u201d are also used as traditional Chinese medicines for the treatment of some ailments such as reducing fever to induce urination, stimulating menstrual discharge and promoting lactation [55]. Nevertheless, the two species contain different components: for C. montana, the triterpenoid and its glycoside are major components, while C. armandii mainly contains flavonoids [10].",

            "text": "However, only a few of the investigations have been reported for the bioactive proteins from Clematis genus besides some cyclic compounds (e.g., alkaloids, triterpenoids and flavanones) [10]. It has been reported previously that an N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin was purified from winter aconite (Eranthis hyemalis), a representative of the plant family Ranunculaceae. This lectin has been considered to be the first lectin isolated from the family Ranunculaceae\n[8]. In this study, we purified and characterized a novel mannose-binding lectin from the stem of C. Montana, which belongs to the plant family Ranunculaceae as well. Subsequently, C. montana lectin (CML) was found to bear remarkable antiviral activities in vitro against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses in cell culture. Furthermore, we showed that this lectin possessed the potent anti-tumor activity by direct cytotoxicity in four typical cancer cells and then found apoptosis in L929 cells. More importantly, we further explored that caspase played a crucial role in the potential mechanism of apoptosis. Moreover, through the sugar-inhibitory analysis, a significant correlation was discovered between the sugar-binding specificity of CML and the apoptosis-inducing mechanism. As mentioned above, these results would provide more insightful clues for understanding the key role of this lectin in further cancer investigations.",

The preliminary carbohydrates specificity assays showed that of all saccharides and glycoproteins tested only yeast mannan rich in oligomannosidic-type glycans and thyroglobulin, a glycoprotein inhibited the agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes (date not shown). To refine the carbohydrate-binding specificity, much more saccharides with the different branched oligomannosides were studied in detail (Table 2\n). It indicated that the agglutination was strongly inhibited by yeast mannan and Man-a(1,3:1,6)-mannotriose. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 1.56 \u03bcg/ml and 2.5 mM, respectively. Man-a(1,3)-Man, Man-a(1,2)-Man and Man-a(1,6)-Man were slightly inhibitory whereas a-methyl-mannoside and 2-deoxy-d-Man were not inhibitory at all, even at concentrations up to 160 mM. These results suggested that yeast mannan and Man-a (1,3:1,6)-mannotriose were the most potent inhibitors.

CML also showed marked antiviral activity against various viruses in cell cultures like some other aforementioned mannose-binding lectins. However, CML exhibited no sequence similarity with other known lectins, especially all the previously reported mannose-binding lectins according to the results of N-terminal homology searching, MALDI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis and database search. Thus, CML might be a novel mannose-binding plant lectin, which has not been reported in any lectin family. However, only the N-terminal homology searching by BLASTp method from NCBI and manually data mining, and further by peptide mass fingerprintings analysis are not remarkable enough to prove conclusively that CML is a completely novel lectin. Furthermore, this lectin may also possess more unknown significant biological activities to further explore our following investigations of CML. So, future studies will be aimed at the molecular cloning and sequence analysis of CML. And based on the cloning results, more information will be obtained and the classification of this lectin would be further clearly defined.",

Con A, a widely studied mannose-/glucose-binding lectin, is cytotoxic or inhibitory to numerous cancer cell lines, which has been reported for its remarkable antineoplastic activity recently [25], [9]. A great number of studies have reported that some \u2018ideal\u2019 anti-cancer candidate drugs can induce apoptosis in susceptible cancer cells [37]. Like these anti-cancer drugs, CML executed dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect on four typical cancer cells. Based upon the morphologic observation, it was found that CML-induced L929 cell apoptosis; moreover, by MTT assay, it also indicated that CML is active in exerting cytotoxicity against L929 cells. It is axiomatic that cancer therapies can work in two different ways, by induction of apoptosis as well as by direct cytoxicity [12].",

            "text": "Thus, further study about the mechanism of CML-induced L929 cells apoptosis has been performed. The inspiring finding was that CML was able to activate the caspase-8. Subsequently, caspase-8 activated caspase-3 whose substrates were PARP and ICAD. The ICAD is a caspase substrate that is cleaved to be inactivated and allow CAD to execute the characteristic fragmentation of DNA. Thus, the ICAD expression in L929 cells was examined to confirm the activation of caspase-3. The roles of caspase-8 and caspase-3 are not only substantiated to be associated with participation of caspase inhibitors, but also seems to be restricted to apoptosis mediated by upstream death receptor pathway or mitochondrial pathway [6], [45]. Consequently, based upon the observations reported, we suggested that the above-mentioned two major pathways are likely existing in apoptosis induced by CML. Further investigation of these possible mechanisms would clearly affect the outcomes of this lectin, including a wide variety of agents currently used in cancer treatment and pharmaceutical application [31], [33].",

In the current study, we found a typical caspase-dependent apoptosis through participation of three caspase inhibitors and Western blot analysis. The distinction of their antineoplastic mechanisms might be due to the fine differences of their carbohydrate-binding sites. In our study, it indicated that the anti-tumor activity decreased abruptly and the phenomenon of apoptosis almost disappeared when the carbohydrate-binding site was fully inhibited. Thus, the CML binding might be the predominant reason which sparks off the significant anti-tumor biological characteristics, even casting a crucial impact on its potential apoptotic mechanism. In recent years, some research has reported the PCL-induced apoptosis in A375 cells [27], [28] and comparisons of the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities among PCL, OJL and LNL in MCF-7 cells [31]. In addition, other major lectin families, such as RIPs II, have also been reported to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells for several years [26]. These results indicate that the various lectin families-induced apoptotic mechanism is a caspase-dependent pathway and would provide more clues for further elucidating their anti-tumor activity and mechanisms in lectin studies. Accordingly, this interesting finding would drive us a principal force to further explore the significant correlation between the carbohydrate-binding-specificity and the antineoplastic molecular mechanism.",
