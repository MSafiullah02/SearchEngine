When bovine serum albumin (500 mg/mL) was added, the inhibition of both proteases by quaternary benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids (QBA) (50 mM) was significantly diminished. Strong interaction of chelerythrine and sanguinarine with bovine and human serum albumin was proved by electrophoretic determination of their respective conditional binding constants.",

Several plants containing QBA are used in traditional medicine and homeopathy (Dost\u00e1l and Slav\u00edk, 2000) . The standardized QBA containing extracts, sanguinaria extract (from Sanguinaria canadensis L., Papaveraceae) and sanguiritrin (from Macleaya cordata (Wild.) R. Br., Papaveraceae) are used as ingredients in oral hygiene products because of their promising antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects (Tenenbaum et al., 1999) . The physiological effect of QBA is pleiotropic (Walterov\u00e1 et al., 1995) . They affect basic molecular targets common to all cells, an effect depending mainly on the reactivity of the iminium bond of the benzo[c]phenanthridine nucleus (Dost\u00e1l and Pot\u00e1\u010dek, 1990) . Many observed biological effects of chelerythrine and sanguinarine involve the formation of a labile covalent bond between the SH groups of a cell component and an electrophilic C6 carbon (Walterov\u00e1 et al., 1981) . QBA are strong DNA intercalators (Walterov\u00e1 et al., 1995) . The in vitro and in vivo activities of QBA versus the safety of phytopreparations containing plant extracts with QBA has been an unending history of controversial discussion (Elvin-Lewis and Lewis, 1995) .",

The complex array of cell membrane protease roles makes these molecules attractive as a model for the study of QBA interactions with non-SH proteins. APN and DPP-IV are involved, by proteolytic as well as by nonproteolytic mechanisms, in a number of physiological functions such as limited proteolysis of biologically active peptides, cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion and signalling (\u0160edo et al., 1996) . APN inhibitors could interfere in some steps of the pathogenetic cascade of inflammation, tumour penetration through the basal membrane and human coronavirus infection (Riemann et al., 1999) . DPP-IV plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, DNA synthesis and cytokine production, not only in T cells, but also in other systems, and the enzymatic activity seems to be an important prerequisite for at least some of DPP-IV molecule functions; it has been well demonstrated that DPP-IV inhibitors block the above mentioned processes (DeMester et al., 1999) .",

In this paper, the inhibitory effect of chelerythrine (1), sanguinarine (2), fagaronine (3) (Fig. 1) , and sanguiritrin (a natural mixture of 1 and 2) on APN and DPP IV is described.

The APN and DPP-IV activities were measured photometrically with substrates Ala-pNA and Gly-Pro-pNA, as described previously (Nagatsu et al., 1976) . The incubation mixture (total volume 250 mL) contained 200 mL of 66 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 with or without tested alkaloids (final concentration 25 and 50 mM; it was not possible to test higher alkaloid concentrations due to their limited solubility) or sanguiritrin (final concentration 9 and 18 mg/mL) with or without BSA and 50 mL of cell suspension of about 2\u00c210 6 cells in phosphate buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 4 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.76 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.40) or 50 mL of FCS. Preincubation was carried out at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Then the reaction was initiated by adding 50 mL of substrate solution, to reach a final concentration of 1.4 mM. After 30 min incubation in a water-bath at 37\u00b0C with continual agitation of test tubes, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 mL of buffer pH 4.2. The controls included all the reagents in the assay, with the enzyme added after the reaction was stopped. The absorbance of liberated 4-nitroaniline was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in the supernatant after centrifugation (6000 \u00c2 g, room temperature, 10 min) using blank samples containing appropriate concentrations of each alkaloid. All assays were done in duplicate. For calibration curves, DMSO solutions of 4-nitroaniline were used. The enzyme activity was calculated in nkat/ mL of the reaction mixture and expressed as residual activity (%). The fluorescent kinetic method for the measurement of protease activities using aminomethylcoumarin labelled substrates was not applicable to our experiments because of the quenching of relevant excitation wavelengths by alkaloids in the reaction mixture.",

            "text": "Chelerythrine (1), sanguinarine (2) and sanguiritrin were strong inhibitors of APN activity in C6 cells ( Fig. 2A) . The efficacy of these alkaloids and sanguiritrin was comparable to that of APN inhibitors Bestatin (Ubenimex), ((2S,3R-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl)-Lleucine) and Amastatin ((2S,3R-3-amino-2-hydroxy-5methylhexanoyl)-Val-Val-Asp-OH. HCl). Under the experimental conditions used, 1 and 2 occurred in the pseudobase (alkanolamine) form (Dost\u00e1l et al., 1996) , which is the actual reactive species forming a complex with the enzyme, due to the formation of a labile covalent bond. On the other hand, fagaronine (3), a quaternary cation at pH 7.40, did not inhibit at either concentration tested. Interestingly, however high the activity of APN was measurable in FCS, we did not observe an inhibition by any alkaloid tested (data not shown). Thus, APN activity was studied in the cell system, in the presence or absence of BSA. Albumin significantly diminished the inhibitory effects of 1, 2 and 3 against APN activity ( Fig.  2A) . Such effects were dose dependent with 50-500 mg/ mL concentrations of BSA (data not shown). Higher BSA concentrations in the enzyme assay were impossible to reach due to sample precipitation. In order to quantify the intensity of the QBA interaction with albumins, the conditional binding constants of alkaloids 1 and 2 were measured electrophoretically (Table 1) . Both alkaloids exhibited strong interaction with BSA and HSA at pH 7.40. The stabilities of complexes 1 and 2 with both albumins are not different. The investigation of 1 and 2 forms participating in interactions with albumins showed the pseudobases as the interacting species. The inhibitory effect of sanguiritrin on APN activity is similar to that of alkaloids 1 and 2. As for the second enzyme system tested, DPP-IV, we failed to obtain unambiguous results (Fig. 2B) . Substances 1, 2 and sanguiritrin inhibited in a similar way to the specific DPP-IV inhibitors Diprotin A (H-Ile-Pro-Ile-OH) and B (H-Val-Pro-Leu-OH) (data not shown). In this case albumin significantly diminished the inhibitory activity of 2 and sanguiritrin but not that of 1. Fagaronine (3) inhibited DDP-IV less efficiently but the effect of albumin addition was the most marked among the tested alkaloids. We were not able to determine fagaronine (3) binding constants due to the absence of its electrophoretic mobility at pH 7.40. The ionization of hydroxyl substituent at C2 of 3 may be considered responsible for its zwitterion form, and, consequently, for the absence of an electrophoretic charge. We deduce that for DPP-IV inhibition, the QBA form is not the most important factor since comparable inhibition was achieved with both alkaloids 1 and 2 occurring as pseudobases and with 3 in the form of a quaternary cation. The unexpected reversal effect of albumin addition on the DPP-IV activity was observed for the inhibition by 1. We assume that QBA inhibition of DPP-IV is complex and we are not able to explain it unambiguously at present. Marked, but nonspecific, effects of QBA on the functions of structurally different biopolymers support the views of the authors who consider questionable the long-term use of natural remedies containing QBA (Damm et al., 1999) . Our results presented here raise questions on the safety of QBA containing plant extracts as well. Due to their reactivity, QBA can be included among compounds with mutagenic and/or carcinogenic characteristics. Further studies related to the QBA toxicity and to the mechanism of their action in different types of mammalian cell models are underway in this laboratory.",
