The population is currently estimated at 6600 animals and continues to decline as a result of ongoing habitat fragmentation, conflict with humans, and infectious disease.1, 5 Predation by lions and competition with spotted hyenas also contribute to population suppression.6 There are approximately 600 African wild dogs in zoos, which serve to educate the public and fulfill an important role as ambassadors aiding the recovery effort for this species.",

Adults weigh 18\u201335 kg, with males slightly larger than females.2, 3, 7 The average age of survival in zoos is 10.3 years8; a few animals live 12\u201316 years.2, 7, 9 The African wild dog's most striking characteristic is the tricolored spotted coat, for which it received its Latin name, Lycaon pictus, meaning \u201cpainted wolf.\u201d It has large round ears, lacks a supracaudal (tail) gland, has four digits on each limb (lacks dew claws), and the pads of the middle digits are connected by dermal webbing. Reproductive anatomy is similar to that of domestic dogs in both males and females, but females have 12\u201314 mammae. They have very sharp, large premolars relative to their body mass, which allow them to consume sizable quantities of meat and bone with impressive speed. The dental formula is I3/3, C1/1, PM3/4, M3/3 = 21, of which the last mandibular molar is vestigial and generally not visualized.1\n",

It involves working across institutions to create and maintain packs that thrive socially, support a healthy population, and sustain genetic diversity. The most stable social groups include a well-established dominant pair with male offspring of any age and young female offspring. The inability to disperse may result in conflict between female offspring above 18 months of age and the dominant female. The decreasing frequency of \u201choo-calls\u201d (long-distance communication calls) and distance between resting sites of same-sex groups suggest that unrelated individuals under human care are more likely to integrate into a pack successfully.10 If animals need to be separated due to social incompatibility, it is recommended that individuals be split up as same-sex packs or with littermates less than 18 months of age.7 Contraception for reproductively mature individuals intended to reduce aggression has not been successful.7 Measurement of fecal corticosteroids may be a useful management tool and has demonstrated that dominant animals generally have the highest stress levels.11, 12, 13\n",

If separation is required, it may be helpful to subdivide the pack and then reintroduce them all simultaneously. Alternatively, introductions of subordinate dogs first, then dominant pairs, may be effective.",

Anesthetic regimens selected should take into account health status, age, and environmental conditions. In cases where cardiovascular disease has been confirmed or cardiac status is unknown, alpha-2 agonists should be avoided and alternatives such as ketamine-midazolam-butorphanol with propofol or gas anesthesia (isoflurane, sevoflurane) should be considered. Chemical restraint protocols used in African wild dogs may be found in Table 77.2\nand have been previously published.32, 33, 34 Drug combinations at higher dosages for free-ranging African wild dogs are available in the literature.35, 36 Reversal of alpha-2 agonists and opioids with atipamezole and naloxone decreases recovery time. To avoid dysphoria, it is advised to wait at least 60 minutes postinduction before administering reversals. Recovery in a crate or nest box may reduce struggles to stand during recovery. Telazol (tiletamine HCL and zolazepam HCL, Zoetis, Parsippany, New Jersey) as a sole agent or used in combination with medetomidine is a reliable option during an emergency response but often results in a prolonged recovery time.34 Vascular access, intubation, and monitoring equipment are applied as in other canids. Every wild dog anesthesia should include oxygen supplementation, electrocardiography (ECG), and monitoring of pulse oximetry, heart and respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature.",

Sibling groups and offspring have been affected over multiple generations, suggesting that the condition has a genetic, inheritable basis, as is well documented in domestic dogs.8 Cases range from minor to severe valvular insufficiency with congestive heart failure (Fig. 77.3\n). Mildly affected animals exhibit no clinical signs, making the condition difficult to detect. The extent of this disease is uncertain, but it is highly probable that cardiac disease is underdiagnosed. Incorporating echocardiographic examination with preventative health evaluations for captive wild dogs is recommended by the SSP in order to identify and medically manage affected individuals.8 Treatment recommendations are based on those for domestic dogs and have included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, and inodilators (pimobendan). Despite the challenges associated with a progressive genetic bottleneck, it is strongly recommended that individuals with cardiac disease not be selected for breeding to prevent further incorporation of genetic defects into breeding lines (Briggs, personal communication, April 22, 2017).",

Vaccine recommendations for domestic dogs have been reduced from yearly to triennially; however, it is unknown whether nondomestic canids maintain titers in a similar manner. In one study, protective titers from the Purevax vaccine persisted in 39%\u201385% of African wild dogs for a minimum of 1 year.55 Early studies have indicated that vaccination with killed rabies vaccines may not be sufficient for protection.5, 50, 56 However, a recent study showed that a single intramuscular vaccination of dogs older than 14 weeks with Imrab 3 (Merial Inc., Athens, Georgia) provided persistent protective titers.57 A survey in 2006 showed that most African wild dogs maintained presumably protective titers after vaccination for canine distemper and rabies for 1 year; however, few dogs maintained titers for 2\u20133 years.58 There is a paucity of scientific information regarding vaccination against canine parvovirus and leptospiral infection. Protocols should be developed that take into consideration local environmental disease prevalence, animal health, and risk factors. Select vaccination protocols for captive African wild dogs are listed in Table 77.5\n(see also Chapter 79).",
