Resilience may represent a protective factor against stressful and demanding challenges. Therefore, the aim is to systematically review the quantitative studies on resilience in healthcare professionals providing palliative care to adult patients. Methods A literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases was performed. The review process has followed the international PRISMA statement guidelines. Results At the initial search, a total of 381 records were identified. Twelve articles were assessed for eligibility and, finally, 6 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Of these, four researches were observational and two interventional pilot studies. From the systematic synthesis, palliative care providers' resilience revealed to be related to other psychological constructs, including secondary traumatic stress, vicarious posttraumatic growth, death anxiety, burnout, compassion satisfaction, hope and perspective taking. Conclusions The current systematic review reported informative data leading to consider resilience as a process modulator and facilitator among palliative care professionals. A model on palliative healthcare providers' experience and the role of resilience was proposed. Further studies may lead to its validation and implementation in assessment and intervention contributing to foster palliative healthcare professionals' well-being.",

Originally, it was conceptualized as a trait, thus as a stable attribute determined by personality [2] [3] [4] [5] . More recently, resilience has been considered as a result of multiple factors protecting individuals from the negative effects of stress and adversity [6] . This approach includes internal factors such as (epi)genetics, personal traits or beliefs [7] [8] [9] and external and environmental factors like social, material or energy resources [10] . Finally, resilience has been intended as a contextual and dynamic process of adaptation, considering temporal aspects like pre-adversity functioning and trajectories of postadversity adjustment [11, 12] .",

            "text": "As a result, over the years, researchers have approached the study of resilience from different perspectives. Aburn et al. [13] conducted an integrative review examining how resilience is defined in empirical research. According to the authors, resilience describes and explains the complexity of the responses-given by a person or a group-to traumatic and challenging circumstances [13] . However, further definitions were provided. On the one hand, several authors considered resilience as a process of overcoming adversity and rising above in front of crisis and trauma [14] [15] [16] [17] . On the other hand, resilience was explained too as the ability to adjust or successfully adapt to challenging situations [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, some researchers referred to resilience as the result of personal strength originating from previous experiences and social support throughout a demanding and a stressful period [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] . In addition, others considered good mental health as a 'proxy' for resilience [16, 25, 26] . Based on this definition, a resilient individual may present a stable trajectory of healthy functioning after adverse or traumatic events. Finally, resilience was described as the ability to 'bounce back' too. In other words, resilient individuals or groups may be able to recover from traumatic or difficult events jumping back to a baseline condition of health or well-being [27] .",

Since health care may represent a stressful and demanding challenge, resilience has been recently recognised as a potential resource for healthcare professionals. Indeed, in a recent review, a strong correlation between resilience, high persistence, high-self-directedness and low avoidance of challenges was identified suggesting that resilience may represent a protective factor in terms of maintaining an adaptable and effective workforce [29] . Moreover, diverse studies considering healthcare professionals identified resilience as a positive attitude towards patient population, as well as a competence to be developed or strengthened [30] [31] [32] [33] . Resilience was described as a personal resource, leading to positive adaptation [29] and a protecting factor against burnout [34] . Studies on healthcare professionals working in critical care units were conducted too, showing the mediating role of resilience between burnout conditions and health-related quality of life, buffering the impact of negative outcomes of work-related stress [35, 36] .",

The intervention led participants to a reduction in perceived stress and an increase in perspective taking. Klein et al. [46] proposed an intervention consisting of sessions aimed to educate participants about compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma, self-care, resilience and quality of life completing self-assessments and participating to group discussions.

            "text": "A recent qualitative systematic review focusing on resilience in palliative care inpatient nursing workforce identified exposure to death, stress and coping as informative subthemes [41] . According to the emerged results, resilience occurs when adversity and stressful experiences lead nurses to adapt through a meaning construction process. Therefore, the cognitive ability to give meaning and shape to stress appears to determine resilience development or maintenance. Similarly, in the current systematic review, resilience appeared to be an influencing construct in palliative care professionals' well-being. In particular, it seems to modulate death anxiety, traumatic experiences, stress and burnout predicting vicarious posttraumatic growth, compassion satisfaction, hope and increased perspective taking. As a result, while in the model of Powel et al. [41] resilience may be seen as originating from adverse experiences and the result of abilities aimed to overcome challenging situations, in the present model we propose, resilience could be considered as a process modulator and facilitator that may help palliative care professionals to reach positive adaptation (Fig. 2) . Summing up, both two models focus on healthcare professionals' well-being within a context where end-of-life and chronicity reveal to be influencing aspects. Specifically, stressful experiences, trauma, exposure to death and growth appear to be common aspects included in the systematic synthesis. As for the differences, while Powel et al.'s [41] model adopted a qualitative approach and considered coping and meaning construction, the current research adopted a quantitative approach identifying burnout, compassion satisfaction and positive thinking (i.e. hope, perspective taking) as factors to be included in the data analysis. Thus, the two models may be integrated in order to orient future researches to develop a mixed-methods model explaining resilience in this population, as well as to promote resilience as a factor in support of palliative care professionals' personal growth.",

Nevertheless, the current systematic review reported informative data leading to consider resilience as a process modulator and facilitator among palliative care professionals. From the analysis of the included studies, particular attention on research concerning palliative care providers' resilience should be taken into account, as working in contact with end-of-life and chronic illness on a daily basis may put their well-being at risk. The validation of the proposed model on the role of resilience may lead to its implementation in assessment and intervention contributing to foster palliative care professionals' well-being.",
