            "text": "The tumor-specific immunoglobulin (idiotype, or Id) clonally expressed by B cell lymphomas can serve as a target for therapeutic vaccination against B cell malignancies [1]. Immunization with this and other full-length protein tumor antigens has the goal of eliciting tumor-specific T cell and/or antibody responses capable of inhibiting tumor growth [2]. Tumor-specific Id proteins are isolated from individual B cell lymphomas by either fusion with a myeloma cell line to generate a tumor-myeloma hybridoma secreting tumor-specific Ig, or by molecular cloning of the tumor's heavy- and light-chain variable region Ig genes for production of recombinant Id in a variety of expression systems. Each of these methods yields a patient-specific tumor antigen for immunization. Vaccination with tumor-derived Id may elicit a polyclonal antibody response as well as CD8+ and CD4+ T cells recognizing Id-derived peptides presented on class I and class II MHC proteins at the tumor cell surface [1]. To improve immunogenicity, Id is chemically conjugated to the highly immunogenic foreign carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) [3]. Phase I/II trials of Id-KLH vaccination in lymphoma patients demonstrated a correlation of induced anti-Id immune responses with improved progression-free and overall survival [4], [5], clearance of circulating lymphoma cells [6], and durable tumor regressions [7], [8], [9], prompting the initiation of several phase III clinical trials of Id-KLH vaccination [10].",

MR-mediated uptake of glycoprotein antigens by DCs has been shown to enhance antigen presentation to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in both murine [14], [15], [16] and human [17], [18], [19], [20] systems. Indeed, MRs expressed by DCs appears to be critical for the uptake and \u201ccross-presentation\u201d of soluble glycoproteins to CD8+ T cells [14], [15].",

Production of recombinant protein in insect cells leads to altered glycosylation patterns, including a relative abundance of terminal mannose residues [21], [22], thereby offering improved binding to MRs present on antigen presenting cells. Baculovirus-produced proteins are currently under study as vaccines against a number of viral pathogens, including human papilloma virus [23], influenza [24], HIV [25], hepatitis E [26], and the SARS/coronavirus [27] among others [28], as well as a variety of therapeutic human cancer vaccines [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. The efficiency by which large quantities of recombinant proteins can be generated using a baculovirus\u2013insect cell system led to the adoption of this approach for production of individual lymphoma-specific Id proteins for human clinical trials [34]. However, whether recombinant tumor-specific Id proteins secreted by insect cells possessed more desirable immunologic properties than those from mammalian sources has remained unknown.",

We found that the terminal mannose residue content in the insect cell-derived protein endowed it with markedly improved binding to human DCs via MRs, and was accompanied by upregulation of several DC activation markers. In vivo, immunization with insect cell-derived Id induced higher levels of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against the A20 murine B cell lymphoma compared to hybridoma-derived Id, with an associated improvement in the frequency of tumor eradication. Importantly, the altered glycosylation pattern on the insect cell-derived Id did not impair its ability to induce Id-specific antibodies reactive against the native protein. An approach combining the use of recombinant insect cell-derived Id and conjugation to KLH using a recently described maleimide sulfhydryl-based method [35] produced the highest level of tumor eradication and tumor-specific antibodies. These data support the use of insect cell-derived tumor antigens and maleimide conjugation in clinical trials of tumor antigen-carrier protein conjugate vaccines.",

Recombinant baculovirus-derived A20 Id (BV Id, IgG2a, \u03ba) was produced by cloning A20 lymphoma-derived variable heavy- and light-chain Ig cDNA sequences into a dual expression baculovirus plasmid vector as follows. The approximately 8.4 kb pTRABacA20 insect cell expression plasmid was constructed to contain two cassettes for expression of immunoglobulin proteins containing murine kappa light chains and IgG2a heavy chains. Expression from the first cassette is controlled by the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter and polyadenylation site, and directs synthesis of a protein containing the A20 kappa variable region fused to the murine kappa light chain constant region present in the pTRABac backbone vector. The human alkaline phosphatase secretory sequence coding region is incorporated into the backbone vector upstream of the A20 kappa variable region cloning site to insure appropriate processing of the mature full length kappa light chain. Expression from the second cassette, transcribed from the opposite strand to that for light chain expression, is controlled by the baculovirus p10 promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site, and directs synthesis of an IgG2a protein containing the A20 heavy chain variable region fused to the murine \u03b3-2a heavy chain constant region also present in the pTRABac backbone vector. The honeybee melittin secretory sequence coding region is incorporated into the backbone vector upstream of the A20 heavy chain variable region cloning site to insure appropriate processing of the mature full length IgG2a heavy chain. Approximately 2 kb to each side of the coding regions promote homologous recombination with the baculovirus genome. This transfer vector was co-transfected with baculovirus genomic DNA (BaculoGold, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) into Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) using standard lipid based transfection methods (Insect GeneJuice, EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) to obtain a high-titer baculovirus stock. This stock was then used to infect High-Five\u2122 insect cells (Trichoplusia ni, BTI-Tn-5B1-4, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for recombinant Ig production [21], [22]. Both insect cell lines were maintained in animal free ESF-AF insect cell media (Expression Systems, Woodland, CA). Three days post-infection, full-length IgG2a A20 Ig was purified from clarified culture supernatant by protein A affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Nucleotide sequences of the 3D6.3 tumor hybridoma and the recombinant heavy- and light-chain variable region Igs were run on an ABI 3730xl (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) instrument and analyzed using Sequencher software (GeneCodes Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). While the variable region (Id) sequences were identical, a modification was made in the light-chain constant region (position 6 amino acid was changed from Thr to Ser) to facilitate the cloning of the A20 kappa chain into the baculovirus vector. A tumor-specific human recombinant IgG1 cloned from a follicular lymphoma was also produced in insect cells as above.",

FITC-labeled human IgG and BV-derived human IgG were conjugated to KLH via glutaraldehyde and incubated with immature human DCs. As depicted in Fig. 2A, both KLH alone and human IgG-KLH showed a modest and roughly equivalent degree of binding to the DCs. In contrast, the BV-derived human IgG-KLH conjugate demonstrated substantially higher (>10-fold increased mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) staining of human DCs. Similarly, after a 2-h incubation with DCs to allow binding and uptake of proteins, fluorescent Alexa 647-labeled Hyb A20 Id and free Alexa 647 each showed moderate uptake by human DCs, while BV-derived A20 Id displayed strikingly higher uptake (>30-fold increased MFI) (Fig. 2B). Since the amino acid sequences of these two A20 Id proteins are essentially identical, but differ substantially in their glycan content, we sought to determine the role of MRs in the affinity of these proteins for DCs. Human DCs were incubated with fluorescent-labeled BV Id, Hyb Id, or dextran in the presence of various endocytosis inhibitors (Fig. 2C). The high-level binding and uptake of BV Id and dextran (a synthetic ligand for MR) by DCs was partially blocked in the presence of the mannose-containing polysaccharide mannan, and by a blocking antibody against MR, but not affected by control antibody. In contrast, these inhibitors did not affect the binding and uptake of Hyb Id. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of microfilament-dependent endocytosis, reduced DC uptake of BV Id, Hyb Id, and dextran, as expected. These results demonstrate a role for DC MRs in the increased uptake of the BV-derived antigen compared to its mammalian cell-derived counterpart. Interestingly, despite the fact that KLH contains mannose residues that can bind to mannose receptors [39], the glycan content of BV-derived Id permits even higher binding to DC mannose receptors.",

The surface expression of two representative DC activation markers were evaluated after incubation with A20 BV or Hyb glutaraldehyde Id-KLH conjugates. Immature human DCs from five donors were evaluated for surface expression of CD80 (Fig. 3A) or CCR7 (Fig. 3B) after 48 h of co-culture. DCs incubated with BV Id-KLH conjugates showed significantly higher levels of CD80 and CCR7 expression compared to DCs incubated with Hyb Id-KLH. DCs exposed to unconjugated KLH showed surface marker levels roughly equivalent to those seen with media alone controls (data not shown). The increases in CD80 expression by DCs cultured with Hyb Id-KLH (vs. media alone) may be accounted for by in part by the mannose content of KLH [39]. The addition of blocking anti-MR antibody to the co-cultures reduced the higher levels of surface marker expression seen with BV Id, in many cases, near to the levels seen with Hyb Id proteins (Fig. 3C). Moreover, marker expression in the presence of Hyb Id proteins was not greatly affected by the anti-MR antibody. Thus, the enhanced binding and uptake of BV Id by DCs is associated with the induction of a more mature immunophenotype, and appears to be mediated in part by interaction with MRs.",

Mice bearing 4-day early established A20 s.c. tumors were vaccinated with BV or Hyb Id conjugated to KLH via either glutaraldehyde or maleimide chemistries. While the standard for most Id vaccine clinical trials has been Hyb Id conjugated to KLH via glutaraldehyde [1], [3], we have recently described an alternative sulfhydryl-based conjugation method with improved in vivo efficacy in multiple murine B cell lymphoma models [35]. The pooled results of three individual experiments are shown in Fig. 4\n. The standard Hyb glutaraldehyde Id-KLH elicited the lowest level of tumor eradication (33%, Fig. 4A). The addition of BV Id to glutaraldehyde Id-KLH gave slightly higher survival (47%). Changing conjugation chemistries to maleimide resulted in still higher survival for both BV- and Hyb-derived Id proteins. Notably, the level of tumor eradication achieved by BV maleimide Id-KLH (64%) was significantly higher than that reached with the standard Hyb glutaraldehyde Id-KLH vaccine (33%, p value 0.0025). Considering only the source of Id protein, in all three individual experiments, BV Id protein conjugates showed a modest survival trend in favor of BV Id over Hyb Id. In the pooled analysis, BV Id resulted in a greater proportion of survivors vs. Hyb Id (53% vs. 41%, p value 0.112; Fig. 4B). Considering only the method of conjugation, maleimide conjugates resulted in significantly improved survival compared to glutaraldehyde conjugates (58% vs. 40%, p value 0.0054; Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that the use of BV-derived Id proteins and maleimide conjugation may both contribute to the significantly improved survival seen in comparison to a traditional Hyb Id-KLH vaccine.",

As MR-mediated uptake of soluble antigen to DCs has been shown to provide efficient CTL induction [14], [15], [16], [19], we compared the ability of BV and Hyb Id proteins to induce tumor-specific CTL activity after glutaraldehyde Id-KLH vaccination. As shown in Fig. 5A, CTL activity from mice vaccinated with the BV Id-KLH was significantly stronger than that obtained with the mammalian cell-derived Id-KLH. To confirm that CD8+ T cells were the in vivo effectors in BV glutaraldehyde Id-KLH-vaccinated mice, mice were depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells prior to tumor inoculation and subsequent immunization (Fig. 5B). Vaccination with BV glutaraldehyde Id-KLH induced significant tumor eradication compared to control-treated mice (HBSS vs. vaccinated and control antibody or CD4+ T cell-depleted, p values 0.0002 and 0.0066, respectively). Mice receiving control or CD4+ T cell-depleting antibodies showed similar levels of survival (Fig. 5B; p value 0.79), indicating no apparent role for CD4+ T cell effectors in vaccine-induced tumor protection. In contrast, mice depleted of CD8+ T cells all succumbed to tumor, just as those treated with HBSS control. Thus, enhanced CD8+ CTL induction appears to be responsible for the improved efficacy of BV Id-KLH vaccines (Fig. 4A and B).",

The use of BV Id neither enhanced nor inhibited the humoral response to native tumor Id (Fig. 6\n).

Indeed, several baculovirus-produced vaccines have recently demonstrated efficacy against viral infections in humans [23], [26]. To meet the challenge of producing large numbers of Id tumor antigen vaccines from individual lymphoma patients, a baculovirus production strategy was adopted [35]. While it was theorized that production of lymphoma-specific Id proteins in insect cells might yield tumor antigens with increased immunogenicity, we wished to test this hypothesis in a controlled setting. We thus performed a side-by-side comparison of Id protein antigen vaccines produced in either insect or mammalian cells for their interactions with human DCs, and their in vivo potency against a murine B cell lymphoma. To our knowledge, this study represents the first direct immunologic comparison of insect cell-derived vs. mammalian cell-derived recombinant tumor antigens. Despite numerous recent studies of BV-produced protein vaccines against a variety of infectious agents and human cancers [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], the degree to which recombinant tumor antigens secreted by insect cells differ in their immunologic properties from those of mammalian sources has remained incompletely characterized.",

In light of this, why might conjugation of KLH to another mannose-containing protein (insect cell-derived Id) offer enhanced DC binding, uptake, and activation over that seen with mammalian Id-KLH conjugates? This may be explained by the topology of Id-KLH conjugates. Id proteins (150 kDa) are conjugated 1:1 (w:w) to the surface of the much larger KLH protein, which exists as a multimeric complex of 8000 kDa [45], yielding a KLH covered with many (approximately 50) Id molecules. Thus, mannose-containing glycans on the insect cell-derived Id could be much more accessible for interaction with DC mannose receptors than glycans on the KLH carrier protein at the core of the conjugate, making the Id protein mannose content dominant in the mannose receptor-Id-KLH interaction. The higher mannose content of a protein antigen coupled to KLH would be important in preserving mannose receptor interactions as a means of increasing immunogenicity.",

Interestingly, the optimal tumor eradication in our study was obtained by combining two relatively novel refinements in Id-KLH vaccines: the use of insect cell-derived antigen, and conjugation to KLH via maleimide chemistry [35]. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to test Id-KLH vaccines employing both MR targeting and maleimide conjugation in clinical trials against human B cell malignancies. In addition to providing increased uptake and activation of DCs, BV Id also elicited superior CTL activity against lymphoma cells (Fig. 5A). Thus, for therapeutic tumor antigen vaccines where the induction of CD8+ CTL is the goal, insect cell production of recombinant protein could prove advantageous.",

Quantities of Id sufficient for vaccination can be obtained from near 100% of human follicular lymphomas using this technology, usually within a period of only 8\u201312 weeks. In a phase II clinical trial in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, several objective tumor regressions were observed in patients immunized with recombinant insect cell-derived Id-KLH [8]. Nonetheless, in a phase III clinical trial, this same vaccine was recently reported to have failed to improve progression-free survival in follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients immunized after cytoreduction with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy [46]. A second phase III vaccine trial in follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using recombinant mammalian cell-derived Id also recently failed to improve progression-free survival after cytoreductive chemotherapy [47]. Only a third phase III trial using hybridoma-derived Id protein for vaccination of follicular lymphoma patients in complete remission after chemotherapy has reported positive results in improving tumor-free survival [48]. The reasons for the failure of the former two trials are unclear, but may relate to the higher tumor burdens in these patients at the time of vaccination. The patients treated on the trial using insect cell-derived Id had the highest tumor burdens of all three trials, so this vaccine may not necessarily be any less potent than the others tested in phase III trials. Our current laboratory results, comparing a single lymphoma-specific Id produced in insect cells to a hybridoma-derived Id, show modest but reproducible immunologic advantages to the insect cell-derived antigen. Furthermore, our data clearly demonstrate that vaccines utilizing both a mannose-rich tumor antigen with a novel maleimide-based carrier protein conjugation method offers significantly improved in vivo anti-tumor efficacy. Thus, combining these and other new vaccine technologies, may lead to improved clinical outcomes with therapeutic cancer vaccines.",
