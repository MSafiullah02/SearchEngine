However, in some areas, endothelial CD34 immunoreactivity was not expressed in the same locations as ACE2 and Oct\u20104 in serially adjacent sections (as indicated by arrows in Fig. 1). In addition, in the media, there appeared to be a lack of uniformity with staining of all three factors (dashed circles). To determine whether there were differences in cellular expression of all three factors between small and large plaques, we studied both types of plaques. In small plaques, we found that all three factors co\u2010localized in cells that were of macrophage appearance but not all spindle\u2010shaped cells expressed all three factors (dashed circles in Fig. 2). In addition, the media beneath plaques also showed a lack of uniformity for all three factors, but ACE2\u2010positive cells and separate Oct\u20104\u2010positive cells were clearly visible (Fig. 2). In larger sized atherosclerotic plaques, all three factors co\u2010localized in cells that were of macrophage appearance, similar to the situation in smaller plaques, and it was difficult to determine spindle\u2010shaped cells owing to the large number of cells of macrophage appearance (Fig. 3). Sections of abdominal aorta from both animals killed at 4 weeks and animals killed at 14 weeks all showed negative staining to the negative control antibody. The present study was undertaken after we observed that disease was present at 4 weeks in our pilot study (4 week group shown with adjacent ACE2 immunoreactivity; Fig. 4).",

In our previous studies, we showed that macrophages and smooth muscle cells of rabbit atherosclerotic plaques expressed the haematopoietic stem\u2010cell marker CD34, indicating that these cell could be of primitive origin (Zulli et al. 2005). We also showed that the RAS anti\u2010atherosclerotic factors, ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor, co\u2010localize in rabbit atherosclerotic plaques (Zulli et al. 2006) and that such cells also express markers of embryonic stem cells, such as Oct\u20104 (Zulli et al. 2007b\n). In addition, our most recent publications clearly demonstrate that human diseased vessels also express markers of embryonic stem cells (Zulli et al. 2007c\n) and the RAS (Zulli et al. 2007a\n), indicating that cells in diseased arteries do express markers of primitive origin or might be primitive cells that have migrated into diseased tissues.",

            "text": "The presence of ACE2/Oct\u20104\u2010positive cells within atherosclerotic plaques indicates that ACE2 could also be involved in the determination of cellular differentiation state. For example, a recent study of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrated that ACE2 expression correlated positively with the differentiation state of human airway epithelia. The authors show that infection of human airway epithelia by SARS coronavirus correlates with the state of cell differentiation and ACE2 expression and localization (Jia et al. 2005). In addition, ACE2 has been shown to be sharply upregulated in maturing oocytes, specifically at the time of oocyte maturation (Bobe et al. 2006). Thus, whether ACE2 expression correlates with Oct\u20104 expression or macrophage/smooth muscle cell/endothelial cell differentiation warrants further study. Indeed, retinoic acid is a compound that could be used both to upregulate ACE2 and to downregulate Oct\u20104.",

            "text": "Retinoic acid has also been shown in a variety of cell culture experiments to impact a variety of cellular processes. For example, treatment of embryonal carcinoma cells with retinoic acid was associated with profound changes in cell morphology that also expressed smooth muscle \u03b1\u2010actin that also functionally responded to angiotensin II (Blank et al. 1995), indicating that other effects of retinoic acid might be to stimulate a more pro\u2010constrictive cellular environment as well as ACE2. All\u2010trans retinoic acid is also a potent stimulator of embryonic stem\u2010cell differentiation, and it is suggested that one of the mechanisms of action is via decreasing Oct\u20104 (Faherty et al. 2005), which is a transcription factor whose expression is associated with an undifferentiated cell phenotype and is downregulated when the cells differentiate (Pesce & Scholer, 2001). For example, a recent study by Faherty et al. (2005) clearly shows that that the level of at\u2010RA is an important determinant of cell fate. They showed that in embryonic stem cells, lower levels of retinoic acid (0.1\u201310 nm) promoted the formation of epithelial\u2010like cells, whereas higher levels (100\u201310 000 nm) favoured differentiation into fibroblastic\u2010like cells. This study suggests that the dose of at\u2010RA is important in the determination of cell type; therefore, further experiments aimed at determining the dose of at\u2010RA that allows for a more stable plaque phenotype are warranted.",
