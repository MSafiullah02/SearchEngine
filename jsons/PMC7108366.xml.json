Bioaerosols are an important transmission route for infectious and sensitization agents, inducing infectious and non-infectious diseases in both animals and humans. However, there is a substantial lack of information in the field of bioaerosol research in terms of what organisms or components may be found in different environments, how they become aerosolised, and their impacts on health. Most studies have focused on occupational bioaerosol-related hazards faced by workers who are continually exposed to highly contaminated environments.",

However, only a small proportion of the total bioaerosol burden in any given environment is culturable. There are two main explanations for this: firstly, there are many biological components that cannot be measured by culture, such as cellular fragments and components; and secondly, many organisms are not easily cultured or are rendered unculturable by air sampling or aerosolization processes (Amann et al., 1995, Peccia and Hernandez, 2006). Whilst these non-culturable agents may not be infectious, they can cause inflammation and sensitization (Girard et al., 2009, Glazer et al., 2007, Thorne et al., 2006), and they can exacerbate existing chronic respiratory diseases.",

The importance of the application of these methods was illustrated when they were used in the discovery of significant amounts of archaea present in the atmospheres of several working environments, in particular in agricultural settings (Blais Lecours et al., 2012, Just et al., 2013, Nehme et al., 2009). Archaea are fastidious organisms (Khelaifia et al., 2013, Wolfe, 2011), and consequently, traditional techniques had never identified them in bioaerosol studies. Newly described bioaerosol components such as these could be a factor in several bioaerosol-related diseases with unknown aetiologies (Eduard and Heederik, 1998). For example, chronic bronchitis is prevalent in people who work in swine barns (Sahlander et al., 2012), but the definitive cause has yet to be clearly identified. It is therefore important to employ several detection approaches, including non-culturable testing.",

Their conidia and spore structures are designed to allow airborne spreading, and thus are well adapted for transport through air currents. Additionally, they are not as sensitive to aerosolization and sampling stresses as bacteria, archaea or viruses and are easier to detect by culture-dependent methods. Fungal spore counts and fungal fragment evaluations are often used for their detection and few molecular approaches have been developed for their detection in bioaerosols (Gorny, 2004, Lee and Liao, 2014, Simon and Duquenne, 2014).",

When carrying and transmitting infectious microorganisms, bioaerosols may initiate an infection in the respiratory tract or other parts of the body (Roy and Milton, 2004, Roy and Reed, 2012). Well known examples of airborne respiratory diseases include tuberculosis (LoBue et al., 2010), the common cold (Jaakkola and Heinonen, 1995), influenza (Bridges et al., 2003), and legionellosis (Nguyen et al., 2006). Only viable airborne agents can cause infectious diseases. In addition, bioaerosols that contain non-culturable microorganisms or their fragments can lead to chronic or acute diseases (Bunger et al., 2004, Fogelmark et al., 1991, Shahan et al., 1994). These non-infectious bioaerosol components can have immunogenic potential that induce sensitization diseases if they are present in sufficiently high concentrations (Falkinham, 2003). It is well documented that humans who are exposed daily to these airborne particles can develop allergic and chronic inflammatory responses (Eduard, 1997, Poole and Romberger, 2012). The impact of the inhalation of bioaerosol components on human health depends on various factors such as their infectivity, airborne concentration, immunogenicity and particle size.",

Viruses are the main cause of infections in the upper respiratory tract (sinusitis, pharyngitis) (Lopardo et al., 2012), including seasonal influenza and viruses that cause the common cold (rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus) (Louie et al., 2005). Sensitization diseases in the upper airways include allergic rhinitis and sinusitis and can be caused by whole or fragmented organisms (allergens, endotoxins, peptidoglycan and bacterial DNA) (May et al., 2012). On the other hand, lower respiratory tract diseases (bronchitis and pneumonia) are predominantly caused by bacteria (e.g. Legionella spp, Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae) (Dasaraju and Liu, 1996), although avian influenza (H5N1) can also infect the lower respiratory tract, along with parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (Hall, 2001). This is also the site of chronic diseases such as asthma (bronchus) (Sferrazza Papa et al., 2014), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (alveolar) (Takemura et al., 2008) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (bronchus) (Bettoncelli et al., 2014), which can be caused by bacterial and fungal cells and spores (O'Connor et al., 2013), allergens, peptidoglycan, and endotoxins (Reynolds et al., 2013), which are present on non-culturable agents.",

Indoor settings that contain particularly high concentrations of bioaerosols pose a greater risk to human health than facilities harbouring low airborne biological contaminants (May et al., 2012). Certain indoor settings such as agricultural settings, schools and homes may allow the accumulation of high bioaerosol concentrations, given the density of potential bioaerosol sources (humans, animals, plants) and the lack of efficient ventilation or air exchange systems (Table 1\n). People exposed to such indoor conditions are thus at risk of developing a wide range of respiratory and non-respiratory diseases and conditions (ATS, 1998, Douwes et al., 2003, Kirkhorn and . Garry, 2000, Linaker and Smedley, 2002, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2007, van Kampen et al., 2012). These diseases are often not attributed to specific etiologic agents since a wide variety of organic products (such as allergens) can cause similar symptoms, and it is difficult to identify a specific cause.",

It is known that the thermophilic actinomycete Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula can induce hypersensitivity pneumonitis (farmer's lung) and that exposure to endotoxins is responsible for organic dust toxic syndrome, but are other undetected components also involved in the development of those diseases? Is there a synergy between various components of bioaerosols to exacerbate certain diseases, or even to protect the host from some diseases? It has been hypothesized that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be developed after infection by the influenza virus (Cormier et al., 1994, Cormier et al., 1993, Dakhama et al., 1999). The interaction of various airborne components and their impact on human health is not well known, and is an area that needs to be further explored.",

Archaea are microorganisms constituting one of the three domains of life, along with Eukarya and Bacteria. Archaea are prokaryotes, like bacteria, and both domains share characteristics in their morphology and metabolism. However, archaea have unique characteristics that distinguish them from bacteria: their unique membrane lipids (Kates, 1992, Sprott et al., 2003); a cell wall devoid of peptidoglycan (Kandler and Konig, 1998); the intrinsic capacity to resist several antibiotics (Dridi et al., 2011, Kandler and Konig, 1998); different ribosomal 16S DNA (Baker et al., 2003, Brochier-Armanet et al., 2011, Pester et al., 2011, Woese et al., 1990); and their genetic processes which resemble those of eukaryotes (Allers and Mevarech, 2005, Forterre et al., 2002, Schleper et al., 2005). Archaea are resilient microorganisms that thrive in extreme environments, and are found in complex microbial communities such the gut (Nottingham and Hungate, 1968), and in swine and cow manure (Gattinger et al., 2007, Snell-Castro et al., 2005, Whitehead and Cotta, 1999). It is now known that archaea are also an important part of the aerial environment. As hypothesised by our team in 2008, airborne archaea were detected in high concentrations in bioaerosols of various working environments such as agricultural settings (Blais Lecours et al., 2012, Just et al., 2013, Nehme et al., 2009) and wastewater treatment plants (Blais Lecours et al., 2014), using non-culture techniques. A recent study has shown that methanogens can induce chronic inflammation in the lungs, which can lead to sensitization diseases (Blais Lecours et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Viruses that can be spread by the aerosol route constitute a significant fraction of transmissible infections. Given their complex culture requirements, they are excellent examples of agents in bioaerosols that are difficult to culture. Some examples of airborne-transmitted viral diseases are influenza A and B (flu), coronaviruses (common cold and severe acute respiratory syndrome), adenoviruses (common cold and lung infections), norovirus (gastrointestinal illnesses) and morbillivirus (mumps and measles). Some viruses can also induce an inflammatory response when present in an inactivated or non-replicating form: inactivated Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was shown to induce a response by macrophage inflammatory proteins in epithelial cells (Harrison et al., 1999). However, given their importance in airborne disease transmission and, presumably, the airborne microbial community, airborne viruses are markedly absent in studies that describe the content of bioaerosols. This can be largely attributed to the lack of efficient culture techniques. In the last ten years, the number of studies investigating airborne viruses has increased, however there are still difficulties with the recovery and sampling of airborne viruses. There is no universal assay for viruses, however some publications have reported universal PCR assays for groups of viruses, such as an assay that can amplify RNA from all three flavivirus subgroups (Maher-Sturgess et al., 2008), and another that amplifies RNA from all influenza A viruses (Hoffmann et al., 2001). A neuraminidase assay was described as a potential broader marker for the presence of certain viruses (Turgeon et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2012). Whilst such assays may be useful for detection of suspected viruses in clinical samples, it is difficult to use in indoor environmental settings where the airborne biomass is unknown. Therefore the best approach would be to conduct preliminary studies to describe airborne viruses, in order to determine the viruses that are prevalent in specific environments. One such study was conducted in a solid waste treatment plant, where they used both non-culture techniques and culture techniques to determine which viruses were present in the bioaerosols (Carducci et al., 2013).",

They are difficult to culture, with slow-growing colonies taking 2\u20133 weeks to appear, however, recently molecular biology tools for the detection of NTM have been developed (Veillette et al., 2008, Veillette et al., 2004). NTM are an example of microorganisms that can cause disease in the lungs whether or not they are infectious. Mycobacterial cells and their components are known to cause inflammation in the lungs (Falkinham, 2003). Virulence factors of NTM are unknown (Falkinham, 2009); however it is known that exposure to bioaerosols containing NTM can be followed by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) (Marras et al., 2005). One study showed that, in metal-working fluid facilities where workers had HP, there was a significantly higher amount of NTM in the fluid compared to facilities where no HP had been diagnosed amongst workers (Shelton et al., 1999). Another study showed that several species of NTM induced inflammatory responses in mouse macrophage cells (Huttunen et al., 2000). Naturally occurring Mycobacterium tuberculosis in aerosols can be viable but may not be culturable (Schafer et al., 1999). Several studies have characterized airborne mycobacteria in indoor settings using culture-independent methods, such as peat moss processing plants (Cayer et al., 2007), dental units (Dutil et al., 2007), closed environments containing therapy pools and hot tubs (Glazer et al., 2007) and even hospitals (Vadrot et al., 2004).",

However this method only allows the user to determine whether or not a target organism is present, and does not provide relevant quantitative information. It is therefore not commonly used for air sampling, unless one aims to simply detect a certain agent. An excellent advantage of qPCR is its ability to quantify the amount of genomic material in a sample. This is very important since the concentration of bioaerosols is an important factor in determining the impact of bioaerosols on human health.

Total bacterial and archaeal data are very useful in the evaluation of the airborne contamination of a given environment, because they allow us to target all species present in the sample. Although primers can have more affinity towards some organisms which can lead to some biases (Suzuki and Giovannoni, 1996), this type of test has allowed for the detection of organisms that were previously unknown to be airborne contaminants (Nehme et al., 2009). Unfortunately, no universal PCR assay exists for the detection of viruses (Prussin et al., 2014, Turgeon et al., 2011), so investigators must target specific viruses (Carducci et al., 2013, Masclaux et al., 2014, Verreault et al., 2010). This can lead to the omission of unsuspected viruses, and subsequent underestimation of the diversity of airborne viruses in the studied environment. Carducci et al. suggested that \u2018index\u2019 viruses could be targeted in initial studies (Carducci et al., 2013), but that it would be important to select viruses appropriate to the environment being tested. In their study on solid waste treatment plants, tests were included for hepatitis (types A, B and C), norovirus, adenovirus, and rotavirus (Carducci et al., 2013).",

However, a recently developed tool allows for the discrimination between intact and non-intact microorganisms, which is a strong indication of whether or not microorganisms are viable. It also allows the exclusion of \u2018free\u2019 genetic material that is present outside of cells in the sample. Propidium monoazide (PMA), which was developed from propidium iodide (PI), is a membrane-impermeable molecule that has been used extensively in fluorescence microscopy to discriminate between viable and non-viable cells, as it generally only permeates cells that have a disrupted cell membrane. It was modified by adding an azide group that binds to DNA upon exposure to light, rendering the DNA unavailable for synthesis, i.e. amplification in PCR (Nocker et al., 2006). Theoretically it should also bind to extraneous nucleic acids, which can give inflated results. PMA has been used in conjunction with qPCR to determine the differences between viable (intact) and non-viable (damaged/free DNA) cell counts in some water and environmental samples (Parshionikar et al., 2010), and, recently, has also been applied to air samples (Bonifait et al., 2014, Kaushik and Balasubramanian, 2013, Vesper et al., 2008).",

Recently, these methods have become more affordable and accessible to a wide population of scientists, and it is anticipated that information on bioaerosol metagenomes will subsequently increase significantly. In various environmental studies, including bioaerosol studies, pyrosequencing has identified many organisms that were previously undetected, and has been used to identify airborne metagenomes (Tringe et al., 2008).

Cloning/sequencing techniques have been used in some bioaerosol studies (Cayer et al., 2007, Nehme et al., 2009) and allow very clear identification of species present in a sample. These techniques are time-consuming, however their costs have recently significantly reduced. Fingerprinting methods such as DGGE, TGGE, T-RFLP and ARISA are other techniques used for biodiversity studies (Blais Lecours et al., 2012, Gandolfi et al., 2013, Gilbert et al., 2010b, Maron et al., 2005). These are particularly useful in longitudinal studies aiming to evaluate a change in the complex microbial communities over time. Finally, pyrosequencing and next-generation sequencing methods allows identification of all targeted microorganisms in a sample without significant bias (Nonnenmann et al., 2010), however the associated bioinformatics require time and expertise. Nevertheless, these techniques are very promising as they can be used to discover underrepresented microorganisms from an environment that may be implicated in bioaerosol-related diseases.",

The other problem is that according to the rare biosphere theory, only the dominating sequences are detected when using molecular approaches (e.g. pyrosequencing) (Shade et al., 2012). Bioaerosol biodiversity can therefore be underestimated, making it more difficult to link bioaerosol components to the diseases. However, with careful selection and optimisation of the most appropriate techniques, and continued development of databases, these tools have great potential and have so far allowed for the discovery of important new information about bioaerosol diversity.",

The best way to achieve this is to employ a complementary set of methods that include both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques (Shade et al., 2012). This would help to reduce the bias introduced by the use of only one type of method, and give a more complete set of data that allows the detection of microorganisms that are systematically underestimated by either method. A culture technique may allow for the characterisation of microorganisms present in low concentrations, which are clinically important, such as Gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, culture-independent methods including molecular approaches will identify the microorganisms or cellular components that are present in high concentrations, yet often overlooked by culture methods, such as anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. This has been performed in several studies, particularly in the simultaneous use of PCR and culture for air samples (Hubad and Lapanje, 2013, Shade et al., 2012).",
