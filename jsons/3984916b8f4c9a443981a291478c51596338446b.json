            "text": "3. Conclusion developing nations experiencing the worst outbreak. However, the end of 2019 and entry of 2020 years, shall be considered as black days in world due to inefficiency of the medical care to control the COVID-19 outbreak, because it took away almost 1.14 million human lives as on 10 th April 2020 from 210 countries. The most affected countries are with the most advanced medical care. As declared by WHO, the outbreak of COVID-19 has gradually moved to various countries. On 31 st December 2019, the Chinese government had alerted WHO about an outbreak of a mutated strain of CoV that caused severe illness leading to fatality, and, it was subsequently named as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. The story started when pneumonia in a patient under undiagnosed condition was detected in Wuhan city, China on 31 st December 2019. WHO had taken it seriously and had worked on it continuously to analyze data, provide advice, coordinate with partners, help countries to prepare, increase supplies and manage expert networks regarding the virus. WHO had declared the outbreak of the unknown infection as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" on 30 th January 2020. This international community then had asked for help of US$675 million for the people in states where, people suffer with weaker health care systems, as part of its \"Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan\". On 11 February 2020, WHO had again officially announced a name for the new \"coronavirus disease\" as COVID-19. Following the severe infection rate and fatality, nearly 167,500 COVID-19 infected positive cases including 6,600 deaths was reported with a belief that many mild or asymptomatic cases were still to be clinically diagnosed. This was reported by WHO up-to February 20, 2020. And by 6 th April 2020, the virus was able to kill 89,954 infected patients, out of total 1,537,168 COVID-19 positive cases from 210 countries (CDC, 2020; Chafekar and Fielding, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Fig. 1 ). Most of them were found to be elderly as the pattern of death gets a sharp rise as a function of age of the patients (Fig. 3) , although the fact is clear that it can kill all ages J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 of people, especially patients with co-morbidity. The observed high rate and death in elders could be due to their inherent low immunity and co-morbidity. So, people with high natural immunity contract the disease at a low risk, and if infected, they may not develop severe symptoms. Their natural immunity keeps them safe with mild or no symptoms even if they are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive patients. Moreover, the recovery rate could be high in those patients with high natural immunity. At this early stage of understanding about the new coronavirus, it is unclear where COVID-19 falls on the immunity spectrum. Although, IL-6 is found to be modulated in patients infected with CoV-19. Role of complementary systems, specific antibodies, natural and induced immune-molecules are still to be investigated. Therefore, analyses of the immune-spectrum of such people (asymptomatic cases and patients who have recovered or with mild symptoms) may provide clue(s) to identify the sector where immunity works against . If the answer is to develop antibody, then structural analysis could lead health care researchers to develop therapy against it (Chu et al., 2004, Chafekar and Fielding , 2018; Dong et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Vellingiri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "has been demonstrated that CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane protein ACE2 in order to fuse with the plasma membrane and enters into the host cell. Then a protein in CoV-19 called as the \"S\" protein, is cleaved into two parts. One subunit is called as S1 and the other unit is called as S2. The former one i.e. S1 contains the receptor binding domain which allows it to directly interact and bind to the peptidase domain present in the ACE2 of human host J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 cell. Then the virus needs to fuse to the host cell to release its nucleic acid. This role is discharged by S2 protein of the virus. Therefore, S2 plays a role in membrane fusion. Structural analyses on ACE2 reveal that CoV-2 binds to its typical ligand (amino acid transporter i.e. B0AT1) to form ACE2-B0AT1 complex. However, SARS-CoV-19-receptor binding domain is not same in SARS or MERS. Therefore, ACE2-B0AT1 complex is proposed to be targeted for COVID-19 therapy. Also any antibody that target human ACE2 or coronavirus spike proteins can also be used to clinically investigate its efficacy in preventing the disease (Chu et al., 2004, Chafekar and Fielding , 2018; Dong et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Vellingiri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) ",

The pathogenic features from a cell biology point of view in COVID-19 patients are explained mainly by three stages. The lungs seem to be the main target site of the virus. In mild cases, the air passages are infected while in severe cases, gas exchange sites are affected. Stage 1) it spans 1-2 days of infection. After the CoV-19 enters into the host cell by inhalation as mentioned in section 3.4, it starts replication mainly targeting the ciliated cells in the nasal cavity. Although throat infection and associated issues are common but nasal swab are suggested to be the right sample for the detection of the virus via RT-PCR. Stage 2) it covers next few days of infection where the patient develops common cold associated symptom such as dry cough, fever, tiredness. During this time, problems in the upper airway and conducting airway responses are seen in the patient. It is because the virus replicates and migrates to the lower respiratory tract along the conducting air passages. A strong innate immune system is induced by the host cells.",

About 80% of infected patients show such mild symptoms and the viruses are mostly restricted in upper and conducting airways. Stage-3) this is the last stage of the viral infection under COVID-19 and the patients show clinical symptoms such as hypoxia, ground glass infiltrates, and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Less than 20% of the patients may reach this stage out of which few develop pulmonary infiltrates and manifest severity of the disease. At the severe stage, the virus infects the gas exchange units of the lung, mainly infects alveolar type II cells. It leads to rapid propagation of the virus leading to release of large viral particles and resulted in huge alveolar damage by forming fibrin rich hyaline membranes. Large areas of fibrosis in lungs lead to respiratory choking and death of the patients (Chu et al., 2004, Chafekar and Fielding, 2018; Dong et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Vellingiri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .",

As a result the weight of lungs is elevated in patients. In patients with co-morbidity, it is believed that they are also attacked by viral infection which in turn leads to inflammation in the lungs . It is similar to a typical bacterial infection in lungs. Early histopathological study in patients with co-morbidity especially cancer was found that CoV-19 was also a causative factor for complication of their respiratory issues . The patient detected as CoV-19 positive during operation in lung adenocarcinoma indicates that non-specific attributes included oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, focal inflammation and multinucleated giant cell formation as common histopathological characters with no hyaline membranes. Such patients usually show J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 14 asymptomatic characters for CoV-19 (Dong et al., 2020) . Therefore, early detection of COVID-19 is suggested. South Korea had followed rapid testing for which the country could restrict massive infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. In some cases, postmortem biopsy report indicates that elderly patients have multiple ground glass opacities as also observed in their chest X-ray. Diffused alveolar damage with exudates, predominant lymphocytic inflammation and multinucleated giant cells, along with large atypical pneumocytes could be the dominant features in CoV-19 patients, especially in elderly cases. In such patients, microvesicular steatosis with mild inflammation may be noticed in the liver, and these features are also common in SARS and MERS patients as well.

Many existing vaccines are repurposed to be tested against the disease. There is an argument in favor of the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine (BCG) being useful against infection with CoV-19 virus. However, the clinical evidence is not available. Two sets of clinical trials with COVID-19 patients are underway and shall be communicated by WHO, when and if result will be successful (WHO, 2020b). However, experimental evidence on human and nonhuman studies may disprove clinical relevance for use of the vaccine as a preventive measure against COVID-19. Although two protocols for clinical trial of BCG were reported, both were administered to health care workers who were directly involved in the care of patients infected with CoV-19, and no specific outcome was seen. Hence, use of BCG as a vaccine against CoV-19 is completely irrelevant. Therefore, WHO strongly discourages the use of BCG vaccine for immunization against CoV-19, but continues to recommend for its use in neonatal cases, to immunize them against tuberculosis disease (WHO 2020a,b,c) . However, it is expected that a typical time span required to develop a vaccine from the deadly CoV-19 would take 12-18 months assuming that all other factors are in place.

Logically, although IgM would be the first one to be raised followed by IgG for any infection (including CoV-19), the exact variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes recombination (commonly called as VDJ recombination, Roth, 2014) which generates unique receptors (known as antigen receptors) that can collectively recognize many different types of antigen molecules (RBD of CoV-19 in current case) would provide the next clue for therapeutic purpose.

So, the Wuhan city and its population were entirely isolated from other parts of the country for which the nation had gained the benefit of very low contamination in other parts. China, being the most populous country of the world, has experienced low (although initially it was very high) infection and fatality rate as compared to the other nations (WHO, 2020a,b,c) . Therefore, WHO has praised China as \"perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history\" (WHO, 2020a,b,c) . This was one of the biggest social control campaigns in history and it had covered about 760 million people, a little more than half of the country's population . However, India's ambition was even bigger given its three-week lockdown, it covers 1.3 billion people-almost double the number of Chinese people under lockdown .",

Except emergency services, all other services including bus, passenger trains were cancelled and, markets, malls were closed on that day from 7 am to 9 pm. Another social move was also coupled with Janata curfew. He had also requested his citizens to ring a bell, or to make similar sound using utensils etc. for 5 minute at 5 pm on 22 nd March 2020 on the terrace or balcony. This act was meant to encourage J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 31 the people working at medical and paramedical sectors, cleaning sectors and police, who were rendering their services even under the threat of infection to their own lives.

This was obvious from the current healthcare system present in India. Many international agencies including WHO had suspected that only lockdown in entire nation would not be helpful to eradicate or control COVID-19 in India. Rather quick diagnosis of large number of asymptomatic suspected individuals must be done to isolate them from the healthy persons and vice versa and to provide them with medical treatment.

A period of a few days to travel back to their homes in villages might have been helpful for them. However, intrastate and interstate travel was already restricted on announcement of lockdown. The whole country was on stand still beyond imagination giving success to the government while putting the weaker section into the worst condition. Large-scale inter and intra state migrant workers were trying to walk hundreds of kilometers to their homes due to lack of transport services, while complaining of human rights violation for not providing them with transport and food facilities (Livemint, 2020a) . However, legal instructions from the respective high courts of states were directed to stop such migration of people, because they could initiate stage III infection i.e. spreading of infection among communities. Nevertheless, the direction also included that the government should take care of the people for their shelter and food (Emmanuel, 2020) . False social media about the special inter-state bus service by government to native also resulted to rush of people into several bus stands; Anand Vihar bus terminal, New Delhi, was considered as the most active case. Similar incidents have been observed in Mumbai too. While, the government allowed two international flights to bring back the Indians from two countries like Iran, it could not make secure arrangements for the local migrants (PTI India Today, 2020a). On one hand, few criticized the lockdown for its mismanagement that Indian policies during COVID-19 outbreak were only made to protect the rich and middle class not for the weaker class people, lockdown was arrogant and domineering declarations which had brutal consequences, especially on poor, $22.6 billion economic package for cash and food was too little, too late. On the other hand, many also opined that this pandemic has also sparked unexpected acts of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 36 inevitably with a lot of frustration and anger that life is being disturbed in this way. It is very, very upsetting. I think it is courageous of the government, honestly, to take this step and provoke this enormous public debate and let the frustration come out, to accept that there will be hundreds of millions of people whose lives are being disrupted. For poor people on daily wages, this is a massive sacrifice they are making. And to do it now at an early stage as opposed to waiting three or four weeks later when the virus is much more widespread was very courageous (Sharma, 2020) .\"",

Therefore, it meant for real social interaction among family and friends but without physical meeting. It has positive effects on health and immunity. Social lockdown is a social move that will restrict the rate of both infection and death by COVID-19 (Moerk, 2020) . The disease spreads through various modes other than social contact and infects human subjects though different mode of actions (Doremalen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a, Fig. 7 , for details please see section 3.3 and 3.4).

However, at the moment, social lockdown is the only preventive found to be feasible and effective, and therefore, it is recommended that other counties with low infection rate could follow this scientific but a strict social move for a considerable period to handle the CoV-19 pandemic (Fig. 8) . Eventually, research leading to development of vaccines and medicines is required for healthcare systems to take care of the disease and infected as well J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 40 as, healthy people. Nevertheless, governments, research bodies and common people, look forward with optimism that the world will emerge with a new hope, research and tools for eradicating this infection. At this juncture, it is extremely important to note that individual management under social lockdown seems to go a long way in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, social lockdown mediated drastic reduction of environmental pollution is one of the positive outcomes of this social move. ",

They have noticed that about 86% of all infections were not documented in China prior to 23 January 2020 (including those with travel restrictions). The transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% of documented infections per person. Further, they had noticed that the longevity of similar CoVs in aerosols (up to 1.2 h), on metals (up to 5.6 h) and on plastics (up to 6.8 h) was up to many hours(Doremalen et al., 2020). Therefore, social distancing was suggested by many experts to prevent the disease, so nations across world follow it with mild to stringent level of severity. In this context, various important reports on social distancing are coming up in PubMed. However, lockdown as a tool to contain CoV infection has not been well reported.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f2.10. International progress on social lockdown under COVID-192.10.1. ChinaIn relation to COVID-19 and the idea of social lockdown, China tops the list because both were initiated in China. After experiencing the COVID-19 outbreak, China initiated social lockdown in the last week of January 2020 in Wuhan city, the epicenter of the COVID-19",

The virus also remains mostly undetected in the smaller Pacific island nations such as the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. As of 2 nd April 2020, 18 countries were reported having no COVID-19 infection. Those countries were Comoros, Kiribati, Lesotho, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, North Korea, Palau, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Yemen.
