            "text": "Soon after I (Carlos A. Pereira) established my new viral immunology group at the Instituto Butantan, S\u00e3o Paulo, in 1987, I contacted Ivan Lefkovits at the Basel Institute for Immunology to ask him about the possibilities to identify macrophage proteins by 2D\u2010gel electrophoresis. Since I was in Strasbourg and Freiburg, Ivan invited me to Basel to discuss the issue. I was especially pleased by the fact that the word \u2018macrophage\u2019 did not turn off Ivan's interest \u2013 the Institute was well known for the Jerneian neglect of macrophages. I was not only surprised by the friendly welcome in Ivan's laboratory, but was also impressed by Ivan's willingness to listen to our explanations \u2013 interrupted only by questions concerning the heterogeneity of macrophage populations (and also life span and protein synthetic capacity). We agreed to perform some exploratory experiments, and this initial good contact rapidly turned into an active collaboration. Ivan accepted my PhD student, Maria A. Lucchiari, to his laboratory, and in 1992, we published a paper showing that the pattern of protein synthesized in the liver was profoundly perturbed upon mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) infection [1], and that some gene products related to the induction of antiviral state in macrophages resistant and sensitive to interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3) could be readily characterized [2]. These proteomic studies \u2013 done years before the term \u2018proteomics\u2019 was invented \u2013 represented a turning point in my approach to understanding the basis of anti\u2010MHV state induced by IFN\u2010\u03b3. A few years later, supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, we have found that IFN\u2010\u03b3 was capable of inducing a downregulation of the main viral receptor only in macrophages originated from resistant mice, explaining at least in part the cellular and molecular basis of mouse resistance to MHV infection [3, 4].",

            "text": "The MHV belong to the coronavirus family and are responsible for a great variety of murine diseases [5]. Among the MHV, several isolates although with a high degree of similarity regarding their structure and composition, show important differences of physiopathology. Hence, the MHV3 can induce an acute hepatitis depending on the genetic background of the host. Even low doses of MHV3 induce liver necrosis and high mortality among the BALB/c mice, but the A/J mice are capable of clearing the virus showing resistance to the infection [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The MHVA59 infection, on the other hand, induces encephalitis with chronic demyelination in several mouse strains [11]. Resistance/susceptibility to MHV3 is expressed in a cellular level by a partial restriction of MHV3 replication observed only in A/J mouse macrophages, mainly after IFN\u2010\u03b3 activation. In a molecular level, we have indications that the expression of viral receptors plays an essential role in the restriction of replication. Only resistant A/J macrophages show a decreased expression of the gene encoding for the principal viral receptor (Bgp1a) [3]. Our quantitative biology studies [1, 4] showing upregulated and downregulated proteins and genes in resistant and susceptible macrophages opened a great perspective for investigations of the biological role of these cells and have also confirmed the downregulation of an MHV3 receptor gene by IFN\u2010\u03b3 activation [4].",

            "text": "Since the viral infection normally requires the adhesion of viral particles to the cell surface and internalization of the viral genome, several studies were carried out to demonstrate and characterize viral receptors on target cells. Several viruses were shown to enter the cells by using more than one receptor and isolates of MHV are capable of infecting different cell lineages using different receptors [12] by fusion and leading to cell lysis. MHV binds to a glycoprotein on the cell membrane through the 180\u2010kDa trimer of their S\u2010glycoprotein resulting in a fusion of their envelope with the cell membrane [13]. The main MHV receptors were characterized as glycoproteins of the carcinoembrionic antigen \u2013 the biliary glycoproteins Bgp1a and Bgp2[14]. Hence, during the MHV infection, the receptor recognition by the viral S\u2010glycoprotein confers the specificity and tissue tropism, although the subsequent steps like the membrane fusion and replication may also contribute to the degree of resistance/susceptibility [15]. Studies aiming to clarify the interaction between virus and cell\u2010membrane proteins may represent an outstanding contribution to the understanding of resistance mechanisms.",

A/J and BALB/c spf mice, with age ranging from 8 to 12 weeks, were bred in the animal unit of the Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias II, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. Animals were periodically sacrificed and the peritoneal exudate, serum and liver tissue samples obtained. No animal was found to have MHV in the liver or in the peritoneal exudate. Macrophages were prepared from peritoneal exudate cells collected by lavage with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured in 96\u2010well microplates at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/100 \u00b5l. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2, washed three times with DMEM after vigorous shaking to remove nonadherent cells and used in the experiments. For the binding assays, cells were cultivated in microplates, and macrophages from A/J and BALB/c mice were activated with 100 U/ml of IFN\u2010\u03b3 for 18 h. Protein extracts were prepared by using TRI\u2010Fast reagent (Gibco, BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) as previously described [3]. The protein concentration was evaluated by the Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), and the preparations showed values ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/ml. The enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determination of MHV3 binding was performed as previously described [3]. For the preparation of hyperimmune sera, MHV3 or MHVA59 suspensions were ultraviolet\u2010inactivated for 30 min and used to infect groups of 10 mice with four weekly doses of 100 PFU. Animals were then bled and sera obtained and titrated for the presence of antibodies against MHV using a neutralization assay.",

In this situation, low optical density (OD) values were obtained when normal sera or no virus were used. As expected, higher values of virus binding were detected when BALB/c macrophages were used, which are in direct correlation with the previous description of higher ability of this virus to multiply in susceptible BALB/c macrophages [3, 8].
