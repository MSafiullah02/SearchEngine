            "text": "Of the six previously known coronavirus species, only two other strains \u2013 SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 are zoonotic in origin and have been associated with high risk of severe outcomes and mortality, estimated at case-fatality ratio of approximately 11% and 34%, respectively (WHO, 2003, WHO, 2019). Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, COVID-19 causes respiratory symptoms that are often severe, with current estimates of case-fatality ratio of 3%-4%, although lower estimates should be considered as more global information comes into light (Wilson et al., 2020). While the epidemiology of COVID-19 still unravels and much remains to be learnt, what already appears to be unusual in the case of this and other coronaviruses, is the population at risk. While the most vulnerable population to suffer severe outcomes of respiratory viruses other than coronaviruses are typically older adults, people suffering from chronic medical conditions, and children, in the case of COVID-19 there have so far been no fatalities in children aged 0\u20139 years of age in China. The disease incidence in children also seems to be lower than in the rest of the population; estimated at 2.4% of all reported cases in people under the age of 18, according to the WHO-China Joint Mission report based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases (WHO, 2020a). Preliminary statistics from Italy\u2019s outbreak of COVID-19, currently the second most affected country outside of China with the highest case-fatality ratio to date of approximately 7%, similarly suggest children are not likely to be at high risk of severe disease (EpiCentro, 2020). It appears that COVID-19 infections in children have occurred during the early stages of the pandemic (Liu et al., 2020), but they are reported with less frequency and children do not become as sick.",

In the case of influenza, children aged <5 years are more likely to suffer severe outcomes of both seasonal and pandemic influenza (Ruf and Knuf, 2014). Unvaccinated young children are also at highest risk of measles and its severe outcomes, including death (Lo Vecchio et al., 2019). However, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now COVID-19 are strikingly less common and less severe in children than in adults (Zimmermann and Curtis, 2020). It is likely that a milder representation of the disease in young children results in decreased reporting and testing, thus leading to under-sampling and the possibility that disease incidence is similar in children to adults (Dong et al., 2020). However, this potential under-sampling in itself points to a decreased illness severity and an overall resilience to the disease in children.",

            "text": "Several reasons have been proposed to try and explain this resilience, one of which is a potential for certain immunity due to the commonality of other human coronaviruses in children (Zhang et al., 2018). This reasoning, however, does not explain why the elderly who are also at high risk of infection with human coronaviruses, are not immune. Another potential reason for decreased severity of the disease in children is that pre-existing chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases may predispose adults to more severe outcomes (Guan et al., 2020, Wu and McGoogan, 2020). In this regard, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that plays role in cardiovascular disease, has been identified as a functional receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020), and its potential immaturity in children has been proposed to underlie the reduced disease severity (Dong et al., 2020), but there is currently no supporting evidence to substantiate this claim. There is also a possibility that differences in the maturity of the immune system underlie the different immune responses to an infection. As such, activation of the innate immune system in the early phase of SARS-CoV infection has an important role in the control viral replication (Chen et al., 2010). In the elderly, the innate immune system is less efficient and its ability to respond to infections is diminished, resulting in greater vulnerability of older adults to severe outcomes of infectious diseases (Boe et al., 2017). It is thus plausible that the immune system in the young is more effective in responding to COVID-19, reducing its severity. However, neither of these possibilities really explain why children seem relatively immune (or at least resilient) to COVID-19 but not to influenza or measles and this question is essential to answer. This apparent resilience of children to COVID-19 brings up important ideas that are necessary for the research and medical communities to properly address, and not only in relation to the current pandemic. One is that responses to disease are heterogeneous within a population. Two is that we should be exploiting the causes of this heterogeneity to help patients recover more quickly.",

There is significant cost in both monetary terms and in time in assessing an outcome in both sexes at various stages of hormonal peaks at multiple ages across the lifespan and on the background of a wealth of life experiences. The logistics of \u201cthinking outside the mean\u201d are also complicated and costly. An individual response well-outside the mean could indicate that this single animal or human patient holds the cure to the next viral outbreak, or could just indicate pipetting error or a random variation that is physiologically meaningless for a workable part of the population. The latter issue indicates a particular importance of rigorous statistical approaches in the analysis of our own scientific work and in the assessment of work by others (Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019). A limited sample-size, for instance, may be insufficient to provide valuable information in some cases, but may shed light on critical details in other circumstances when the sample is inherently limited. With appropriate experimental and statistical controls in place, it is therefore essential to start focusing on individual populations of vulnerability and resilience.",

Interestingly, and in line with the pattern of COVID-19 producing milder symptoms in children, there is currently no evidence for increased risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women. We should note, though, that this evidence is based on limited data, while reports from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and from other respiratory infections suggest these conclusions are premature and pregnant women could be at risk of a severe course of COVID-19 (Rasmussen et al., 2020). If, however, pregnancy proves to provide some protection from disease severity, it could offer unique opportunities for the development of therapeutic solutions. It would also be essential to see whether COVID-19 during pregnancy has longer-term implications for the offspring, similar to neurodevelopmental impacts of maternal influenza and other infections (Meyer et al., 2007).",
