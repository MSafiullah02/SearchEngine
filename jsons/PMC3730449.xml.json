All of them were members of nursing organizations and their colleagues knew them as a role model for other nurses. Participant number 5 (known as contrary case) said that she had entered nursing without any motivation to and understanding of the profession. She had left the job after 7 years of working as a nurse. The borderline case in this study was someone who had worked for 14 years in a hospital, was occupied as a head nurse for 5 years, and her colleagues supposed her as a committed nurse. However, she herself claimed that she would leave the career whenever she would find an opportunity and she never encouraged anybody to be a nurse.",

Professional commitment is revealed in other studies as making noticeable efforts.[1015] From the findings of literature review and fieldwork phases, loyalty to the profession and tendency to stay as a nurse are the main attributes for professional commitment in nursing. It has been shown in other studies too. Researchers showed that commitment is one of the immediate antecedents of intention to leave the workplace and turnover; the higher the nurses\u2019 commitment, the lower their intention to leave.[14810151830\u201333] Findings of fieldwork also showed that nurses who have professional commitment are proud with nursing as a high-level profession. Professional commitment is reported in other studies as having pride and eagerly working,[153435] and tendency to permanent learning in the profession.[4836]",
