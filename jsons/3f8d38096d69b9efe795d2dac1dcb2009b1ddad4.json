Although humoral immunity appears redundant for the control of acute virus replication, it is vital in maintaining virus at levels detectable only by RNA analysis. T cell mediated control of acute infection cannot be sustained in antibody (Ab) deficient mice, resulting in virus reactivation. The protective role of Ab during persistence is strongly supported by detection of Ab in the cerebrospinal fluid of MHV infected rodents and maintenance of virus specific Ab secreting cells (ASC) in the CNS long after virus clearance. Ab mediated neutralization constitutes the major mechanism of protection, although fusion inhibition also plays a minor role. Delayed accumulation of ASC, concomitant with a decline in T cell function, assures control of residual virus while minimizing T cell mediated pathology. Although there is little evidence for a detrimental role of Ab in demyelination, an association between Ab mediated protection and remyelination is unclear.",

The chief pathological features are focal areas of myelin loss associated with an 760 Chapter C5 inflammatory response consisting of B cells, T cells and macrophages (2) . The relative contribution of each of these individual immune components remains poorly understood. A variety of cellular and humoral abnormalities have been observed in MS patients (2) . The seminal findings of elevated Ig in CSF (3) as well as humoral involvement in demyelination during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (4) were the first hints implicating humoral components in the demyelinating disease. Increased B cell abundance as well as detection of myelin specific Ab in acute lesions with active ongoing demyelination compared to older, inactive lesions have supported their possible involvement in the disease pathogenesis (5, 6) . Although T cell studies have predominated this field of research based on the detection of activated T cells in MS plaques and involvement of T cells in EAE, current research in both MS and MOG protein induced EAE has reignited interest in the potential role of humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease (2, 7) .",

            "text": "One hallmark of MS is that cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in ~90% of patients is characterized by the presence of oligoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) bands which exhibit restricted isoelectric focusing points (3, 7) . The CSF Ig response is sustained by resident B cells not represented in peripheral compartments (8) . The IgG sequences feature extensive somatic mutations suggesting active antigen (Ag) driven B cell selection and clonal expansion (8) . Oligoclonal bands are also encountered routinely following CNS infections with measles virus, Herpes simplex virus-1 and mumps virus; however, the majority of the Ig are specific for the causal agent (9) . Moreover, detailed studies into the clonality of B cells in both CSF and MS plaques has revealed no single dominant Ag target. These Ab express varied Ag specificities from myelin components, oligodendrocyte protein, viruses, cell nuclei, endothelial cells, fatty acids, gangliosides, and axolemma (7, 10) . Auto Ab could potentially contribute to demyelination by various mechanisms including Ab dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), stimulation of Fc receptors expressed on NK ceils or macrophages/microglia resulting in release of inflammatory molecules, opsonization of myelin resulting in phagocytosis by macrophages, or complement activation. Direct evidence of Ab mediated mechanisms in MS lesions was revealed with the detection of IgG deposition on the borders of the actively demyelinating plaques along with the presence of activated complement fragments and complexes (11) . Ab eluted from MS plaques preferentially bind to CNS self Ag (7) , although this reactivity to a variety of CNS Ag could also be due to liberation of Ag as a consequence of inflammatory tissue destruction. It thus appears that a concerted action of humoral and cellular factors could participate in the induction and/or maintenance of an inflammatory response specific for CNS Ag.",

Virus replicates in various CNS cell types including astrocytes, oligodendroglia and microglia / macrophages. Distinct mechanisms of CD8 T cell mediated control are required to clear virus from the CNS as described elsewhere in this book (12, 13) . As virus replication is controlled, focal myelin loss however, is increased, suggesting a temporal lag between the maximal number of virus infected cells and the loss of myelin. The inability of cell mediated immunity to completely eliminate virus results in a non-productive persistent infection confined to the CNS, predominantly in spinal cord oligodendroglia. Persistent infection is associated with ongoing myelin loss and repair. These traits make MHV infection of the CNS along with Theiler's murine encephalitis virus infection and EAE the three primary murine models to study mechanisms underlying both encephalomyelitis and demyelination (12, 13) .",

Humoral responses are redundant during acute infection as shown by initial virus clearance in the CNS of B cell deficient mice with similar kinetics to wt mice (14, 15) . Unlike the almost complete clearance of JHMV which expresses the immunodominant spike protein derived $510 epitope, infection with the MHV-A59 strain, which lacks this CTL epitope revealed minimal clearance in the B cell deficient mice, thus emphasizing the dominant role of cellular immunity (16) . Similarly, mice deficient in T cells were unable to clear virus (12, 13) . Consistent with a redundant early role of humoral immunity, examination of serum anti-viral Ab titers showed that IgM and IgG are detectable only after the majority of the infectious virus has already been cleared from the CNS (12, 17) . Moreover, examination of the two biological activities of the Ab response directed at the spike protein, i.e., neutralization and fusion inhibition (17) , determined that while neutralizing Ab was initially detectable by day 10 p.i., when most of infectious virus had already been cleared from the CNS, fusion inhibiting Ab was not detected until much later (day 21 p.i.). Thus the delayed appearance of serum Ab relative to virus clearance further supported a minor, if any role of Ab early in the adaptive host response to acute infection.",

The mechanisms of protection by preestablished Ab may merely reside in neutralization of the bolus of infectious virus prior to establishing CNS infection. Alternatively, Ab may modify tropism by prevention of infection of critical cells specifically neurons, thereby increasing survival rates (18, 19) . In other models, suckling mice weaned on immunized dams or transgenic mice which express neutralizing IgA in the milk are protected from acute JHMV induced encephalomyelitis; however, the role of Ab in these models is unclear (21, 22) . A variable percentage of protected weanling mice exhibit a delayed onset of acute encephalitis associated with demyelination. However, delayed onset with progressive disease is associated with CTL escape variants rather than Ab escape mutants or the loss of Ab mediated protective mechanisms (21) .",

Furthermore, following the peak of virus replication, a low but constant percentage of B cells (5-7%) is retained in the CNS during viral persistence (12, 17) . A potential Ab independent, innate anti-viral effector function of B cells in vivo was initially suggested by the observation that B cells from na'fve mice exhibit the ability to lyse virus infected target cells in vitro. Lysis is mediated through an interaction between viral receptor expressed at high levels on B cells and the viral spike protein expressed on the surface of infected cells (23) . This unique cytolysis is inhibited by Ab specific for the viral spike protein, which in vivo is detected only after CNS virus replication has been initially controlled. Hence the absence of Ab early during infection could allow B cells to interact with virus infected cells in vivo, thereby contributing to viral control. However, convincing evidence for this mechanism was negated by studies in transgenic mice containing B cells unable to secrete anti-viral Ab (15) . These mice cleared virus with similar kinetics as B cell deficient mice, excluding an effect of innate B cell function in vivo.",

It has been shown that Ag within the CNS drains to cervical lymph nodes (CLN), which are the major sites of B cell activation following intrathecal administration of Ag (25) . However, virus specific Ab secreting cells (ASC) appear in the spleen prior to detection in the CLN (17) . While there was no major increase in virus specific IgM ASC, the frequencies of IgG ASC increases almost four fold in the CLN compared to spleen suggesting that the majority of initial activation occurs in the spleen, followed by transient CLN accumulation. No virus specific ASC were observed in blood, consistent with previous data suggesting that ASC do not migrate by this route (25) . It is assumed that activated B cells/plasmablasts traffic to the target organ containing Ag where they differentiate to plasma cells and secrete Ab (25) . Recruitment kinetics of anti-viral ASC into the CNS revealed that low frequencies detected prior to maximal viral replication increased only slightly as virus replication was controlled (17) . Thus, based on: 1) the inability of B cells to express detectable anti-viral activity, 2) the paucity of plasma cells in the peripheral lymphoid compartments at any time post infection and 3) the appearance of serum Ab and virus specific ASC within the CNS following viral clearance, humoral immunity appears to have play a redundant role during acute MHV infection of the CNS.",

However, if CNS infection is already well established prior to induction of Ab responses, Ab can help further reduce infectious virus (26) or maintain viral persistence at nondetrimental levels (17) . The beneficial effect of an early Ab response was demonstrated in the rat model of JHMV infection. Resistant Norway rats exhibit a more rapid and robust neutralizing Ab response, determined by detection of serum and CSF Ab and ASC compared to susceptible Lewis rats (27) . Incomplete virus clearance in B cell deficient mice at days 12-14 p.i. support that neutralizing Ab, which first appears by day 10 p.i., indeed may act in concert with T cells during the later stages of acute infection to completely eradicate infectious virus from CNS, particularly as resident CD8 T cells lose their CTL activity (15, 28) . This prompted detailed analysis of the emergence of ASC relative to the decline in T cell activity within the CNS. Virus specific ASC were barely detectable in the peripheral compartments following virus clearance in mice (17) . Furthermore, despite early recruitment of ASC into the CNS, only a minority was virus specific (17) . However, the limited recruitment of virus specific ASC into the CNS 764 Chapter C5 towards the end of the acute phase, at days 10-12 p.i., was followed by a dramatic increase, which continued up to day 21 p.i. While there was a slight decrease in virus specific IgM ASC, frequencies of IgG ASC in the CNS remained constant. The majority of the ASC at this time point were of the IgG2b isotype indicating massive expansion of this subtype specific Ab, with fewer numbers of IgG2a and IgG1 ASC. Preferential expansion of ASC during this period of infection, concomitant with down regulation of CTL activity and inflammation, implies a major role for ASC in CNS during both the terminal phase of acute infection and during chronic infection.",

The relatively long-term presence of ASC accompanied by the decline of other inflammatory cells, including T cells and macrophages, in addition to reactivation of virus in B cell deficient mice enforce the role of Ab in controlling viral persistence in the CNS. Following virus clearance from the CNS in wt mice, viral Ag can be detected beyond day 35 p.i. and viral RNA for up to a year (13) . Virus specific ASC were found at higher frequencies in the CNS compared to bone marrow or any other peripheral compartment even at 90 days p.i. (Tschen & Stohlman, unpublished) . This is in contrast to detection of plasma cells predominantly in the bone marrow following resolution of peripheral infections (24) . The persistence of plasma cells within the CNS appears to be a common trait of many viral CNS infections (26, 29) . While the majority of Ag is cleared from the brain during persistence, viral Ag and RNA are detectable for longer periods of time in the spinal cord (13) . Spinal cords also exhibited increased ASC by histology compared to brain, thereby signifying a causal relationship between prolonged retention of ASC and viral Ag / RNA (16) . A variety of cellular and soluble factors could also contribute to the survival of these cells in the CNS: cytokines including TNF-o~, interleukins 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10, nerve growth factor, or stimulation with CD40L on T cells and Fc receptors on microglia / macrophages. The possible presence of chemokines such as SDF-oq MIP-3[3 or BLC could also contribute towards long-term retention of plasma cells in the brain. Although trapping of B cells cannot be excluded, these data suggest that the CNS provides a nourishing microenvironment that facilitates retention and maintenance of ASC.",

Virus reactivation is accompanied by sustained clinical disease and high mortality rates in contrast to recovery of wt mice that had cleared infectious virus (14) (15) (16) . A similar picture was observed in transgenic mice, which contained B cells that could not secrete anti-viral Ab (15, 16) . Following initial virus clearance, virus reactivated in the CNS of the transgenic mice by day 14 p.i. albeit at a slower, but statistically insignificant rate compared to B cell deficient mice, thus ruling out a prominent role of innate B cell effector function (15, 16) . In addition to multiple Ag positive cells compared to wt mice, histological examination suggested differential Ag tropism in the transgenic mice containing B cells as compared to B cell deficient mice during reactivation (15) . While Ag was detected in all CNS cell types in B cell deficient mice, similar to acute infection, the transgenic mice containing B cells harbored Ag predominantly in oligodendrocytes. Preferential elimination of virus from astrocytes and microglia, suggests either B cell lytic activity during persistence or increased class II mediated stimulation of virus specific CD4 T cells. Irrespective of potential B cell mediated lysis in transgenic mice, this mechanism is irrelevant in wt mice, which have neutralizing Ab in the CNS at this time (15) . Oligodendroglial tropism in these mice is reminiscent of the resistance of these cells to perforin-mediated cytolysis (30) . However, it appears that following initial virus clearance, the CNS environment preempts further T cell mediated antiviral effects. There is no evidence for either increased CD8 T cell recruitment or re-expression of CTL activity in response to reactivation in Ab deficient mice (15, 28) . Such an altered CNS environment, likely resulting from T cell mediated or virus induced pathology, emphasizes the necessity for alternative, less destructive modes of protection during recovery, such as provided by Ab.",

Ab transfer reduced virus to almost undetectable levels in recrudescing recipients at 21 days p.i., compared to high titers in the CNS of control mice. These results in B cell deficient mice, in conjunction with the burst of virus specific ASC in wt mice between days 12 and 21 p.i., clearly suggested that control of viral persistence in glial cells is solely dependent on anti-viral Ab. Further investigation of the mechanisms involved in Ab mediated protection revealed that only neutralizing Ab and to a limited extent, fusion inhibiting Ab could reduce virus reactivation (31) . Monoclonal Ab specific for matrix, nucleocapsid protein or even spike protein with no neutralizing activities were unable to suppress virus reactivation (31) . Suppression of virus reactivation appears to require the constant presence of Ab, as virus reemerged following discontinuation of Ab administration resulting in increased mortality rates. The transient nature of virus control is comparable to other infectious models wherein immunocompromised mice required continuous infusion of Ab to control virus replication (26, 32) .",

These data support multiple studies implicating T cells and macrophages/microglia as the prominent players in the initiation of demyelination during MHV infection (12, 13) . However demyelination in Ab deficient mice does not exclude other humoral mechanisms, including complement and FcR, as contributors to the demyelinating process. Furthermore, infection of nude mice demonstrated the presence of demyelinating plaques albeit to a lesser degree than wt mice, supporting a role for humoral immune responses in the demyelinating process (34) . Infected SCID and RAG-/-mice, deficient in both B and T cells, by contrast, do not develop demyelination. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from immunized nude mice into infected SCID mice however failed to induce demyelination (34) , leaving a pathogenic role for B cells controversial. Nevertheless, a pathogenic role for humoral immunity was also suggested by the detection of IgG, complement (C9) deposits and plasma cells in areas of actively demyelinating plaques in Lewis rats (35) . While an Ab-dependent role in initiation of demyelination is not established, the presence of ASC with viral as well as yet unidentified specificities in the CNS does not exclude a possible involvement in the demyelinating process.

Furthermore, preliminary analysis of B cell deficient mice protected by the transfer of Ab, suggests an ameliorating, rather than detrimental effect on demyelination, similar to the TMEV model (31, 36) .

            "text": "In summary, despite unequivocal evidence that acute CNS infection is controlled by T cells with minimal B cell involvement, B cells and Ab regulates viral persistence. Virus reactivation in the CNS in mice devoid of antiviral Ab results in increased demyelination. A protective role of B cells is supported by accumulation of virus specific ASC following T cell mediated clearance. The prominent mechanism of Ab mediated protection appears to reside in its neutralizing activity. Furthermore, humoral immune mediated control does not appear to initiate or enhance the severity of demyelination. Thus, an evolving model of biphasic immune control of viral infection of the CNS has developed with acute clearance and initiation of demyelination being controlled by T cells while viral persistence and possibly repair is regulated by humoral immunity.",
