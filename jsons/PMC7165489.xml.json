Therefore, a series of experiments were performed to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of HRC 203 on the course of fulminant hepatic failure induced by MHV\u20103 in susceptible Balb/cJ mice. Balb/cJ mice were infected with the MHV\u20103 virus and treated with PBS, free ribavirin, or HRC 203. After treatment, mice were examined daily for effects on survival and clinical behavior. One mouse from the untreated group and 2 mice from both the ribavirin and HRC 203\u2013treated groups were sacrificed each day of the experiment for evaluation of viral titer, hematology, and biochemistry. Untreated MHV\u20103\u2013infected mice all developed clinical and biochemical signs (ALTmax 7986 \u00b1 325 IU/L) of acute viral hepatitis, and died by day 4 post infection (Fig. 6, Table 1). In contrast, survival was enhanced in both ribavirin\u2010 and HRC 203\u2013treated MHV\u20103\u2013infected mice (Fig. 6A).

Livers were assayed for determination of viral titers. By day 3, viral titers had risen to above the minimal detectable limit of the assay, although no significant difference between groups was observed (Fig. 6B). By day 3, all PBS\u2010treated MHV\u20103\u2013infected mice died. Measurements of viral titers from livers of ribavirin\u2010 and HRC 203\u2013treated mice on day 4 demonstrated a reduction in viral replication in HRC 203\u2013treated animals compared with the ribavirin group (Fig. 6B).",

MHV\u20103 causes a spectrum of liver disease in mice including fulminant hepatitis, liver failure, and death.30 The in vitro and in vivo experiments reported here show that HRC 203 is more effective against MHV\u20103 infection than higher doses of free ribavirin.",

Viral replication in macrophages is a prerequisite for MHV\u20103 to gain access to the liver parenchymal cells. MHV\u20103 replication was reduced in macrophages treated with HRC 203, in contrast to macrophages treated with an approximately 20\u2010fold higher dose of free ribavirin. This effect was not due to drug toxicity; macrophages incubated with either HRC 203 or ribavirin were viable as shown by exclusion of trypan blue. Free ribavirin produced no improvement in viral titers, compared with a 90% reduction in viral titers produced by HRC 203. Viral infection of macrophages also activates an immune cascade mediated by cytokine production.25 The production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 is increased in MHV\u20103\u2013infected macrophages compared with uninfected macrophages.25 The delivery of HRC 203 to macrophages via the hemoglobin\u2013haptoglobin receptor, CD163, allows for direct targeting of anti\u2010viral therapeutics to an important member of the innate immune system. Recent studies have demonstrated the increased expression of CD163 in the liver of patients with acute hepatitis compared with those with chronic hepatitis or non\u2010infected individuals.12 The increased presence of CD163 was attributed to the increased numbers of activated macrophages in the livers of affected individuals.12 The benefit of targeting macrophages is supported by the demonstration of a significantly greater reduction in viral titers and a comparable reduction in the production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines using a lower dose of drug in the conjugated form compared with that of free drug.",

Free ribavirin was ineffective at reducing viral replication at a dose of 1 \u03bcmol/L. In contrast, when hepatocytes were incubated with the same concentration of drug in the form of HRC 203, a significant reduction in viral replication (78%) was observed. The dose of HRC 203 required to inhibit viral replication was 10 micromolar (\u03bcmol/L) in isolated hepatocytes, whereas for similar viral inhibition in cultures of macrophages, a 40 \u03bcmol/L concentration of ribavirin was required. Even at a concentration of 1 \u03bcmol/L significant inhibition of viral growth was seen in isolated hepatocytes, whereas in macrophages at this concentration no inhibition was seen.25 We do not have an explanation for this finding, but differences in binding of drug, intracellular processing, or rate of degradation of compound could account for these differences. The release of ribavirin monophosphate might explain the enhanced anti\u2010viral activity in hepatocytes; however, the ribavirin released from HRC 203 has been shown to be free ribavirin and not the monophosphorylated form.13 HRC 203 also inhibited the viral cytopathic effect (syncytia formation) of MHV\u20103, whereas free ribavirin did not. The effect was specific for HRC 203, because neither the Hb\u2010Hp complex alone nor Hb\u2010RV conjugate alone were inhibitory (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest a receptor\u2010mediated process underlying the improved activity of HRC 203 compared with free drug. Although CD163 is not expressed on hepatocytes, hemoglobin and hemoglobin\u2013haptoglobin have been shown to bind to hepatocytes in a receptor\u2010mediated fashion, although the hepatocyte receptor has not been identified.10, 31, 32\n",

In addition, HRC 203 maintained hematocrit values near baseline compared with a decreasing hematocrit observed in the free ribavirin group. Because the hemolytic effects of ribavirin normally occur only after 4 weeks or more of daily dosing in humans,33 whether the apparent avoidance of this effect in the MHV\u20103\u2013infected mice is directly related to this known toxicity of ribavirin is unknown. Nevertheless, although the exact mechanism for the beneficial effects of HRC 203 is not known, the data presented suggest that the coupling of ribavirin to hemoglobin improves the safety and efficacy of ribavirin by targeting the delivery of ribavirin to infected cells.",

Collectively, these results suggest that targeting of ribavirin may allow for enhanced clinical and virologic benefit and set the stage for clinical trials designed to treat patients infected with hepatitis C. Although the results presented here do not suggest the identification of a new form of therapy for chronic hepatitis C, our data suggest that targeted delivery of ribavirin to macrophages and hepatocytes reduces many of the systemic side effects produced by free ribavirin.
