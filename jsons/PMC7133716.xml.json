Moreover, the accelerated pace of globalisation amplifies these risks: a disease is just a plane trip away, and an outbreak anywhere is a threat everywhere.",

The effective implementation of measures to ensure global health security builds a firm, broad-based public health foundation that promotes country self-sufficiency and can sustain health progress in any area in which a country decides to focus.

A key lesson from managing health crises of the past decade is that effective response to emergencies cannot be done by having stand-by systems that are activated only when they are urgently needed, but requires strengthening day-to-day detection, response, and prevention programmes that can be scaled up quickly if needed.10 After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January, 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked with the Haitian Ministry of Health and Population to strengthen disease surveillance and laboratory capacity and help train Haiti's public health workforce.11 This laid the groundwork for rapid detection and effective response to epidemic cholera,12 maintenance and expansion of HIV services during the cholera epidemic,13 and meaningful improvements to protect the health of Haiti's population through disease prevention activities, such as expanded access and higher coverage with childhood vaccines, improved control of filariasis, and improved HIV testing, care, and treatment.14\n",
