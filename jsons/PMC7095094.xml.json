AI uses mathematical tools, \u201cmachine learning,\u201d to iteratively learn patterns within training data and when these patterns are found in new data, the AI translates this into a decision, for example, cancer versus not cancer (Table 1). In recent years, a subfield of AI, \u201cdeep learning,\u201d has delivered a significant increase in accuracy by using new learning approaches, specialized hardware, and significantly larger datasets to find more complex and subtle patterns within the data.",

Social graph analysis can identify \u201cinfluencers\u201d of hand hygiene programs and explore patient safety culture [6, 7].

An HAI social network generated from electronic healthcare record (EHR) patient and caregiver contacts was used to simulate outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and influenza, and identify potentially mitigating interventions [9]. Machine learning applications have been used to predict the risk of nosocomial Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [10\u2022,11,12]. Unlike traditional CDI risk stratification, machine learning is not limited to known risk factors but can consider a range of variables within the EHR to validate the application, and thereafter, models can be developed tailored to a particular healthcare facility or patient population. Machine learning applications can also more readily cope with the dynamic nature of healthcare than traditional surveillance models, whereby if a patient\u2019s CDI risk changes during their inpatient stay, the IPC and clinical team could be alerted accordingly. While prospective studies are required to validate these publications and study other HAI, this tailored approach has the potential to transform HAI surveillance and IPC. Timely accurate identification of patients at high risk of CDI and those at high risk of progression to complicated CDI could facilitate customized IPC and antimicrobial stewardship strategies and anti-CDI therapies [10\u2022]. This approach should also be beneficial for clinical trials of novel anti-CDI therapies whereby patients most at risk of CDI can be readily identified for recruitment.",

This type of analysis could also facilitate detection of potential sources of these events which is frequently a difficult and time-consuming aspect of epidemiological investigation. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is being increasingly used for pathogen identification, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, and strain typing [14, 15]. AI offers the opportunity for more complex analysis of NGS-generated data with the potential to integrate and analyze diverse HAI and AMR data across the healthcare system. This type of integration could help predict patients most at risk of HAI and AMR events and facilitate timely detection of outbreaks with molecular analysis of transmission events and interactions between patients, staff, and the clinical environment in real time. This will improve our understanding of how cross infection occurs, allow focused surveillance, earlier diagnosis, and enable targeted IPC interventions to be developed accordingly.",

A systematic review of machine learning in critical care noted that many studies use datasets that are too small to assess the full potential of AI applications and guidelines on methodology and validation of predictions are required to help translate findings into daily clinical practice [16]. In addition to size and completeness, preexisting databases may be inherently biased by clinical practice and healthcare delivery at that time which may compromise patient care if these biases were incorporated into a machine learning model. As with any publication or guideline, the generalizability of machine learning models for HAI surveillance developed from data in a single healthcare setting is likely to be limited. For example, in one CDI model, risk factors for CDI in one setting were protective in another institution, which may reflect local biases or differences in CDI pathways [12].",

AI could facilitate decision-making when large amounts of data were emerging rapidly, by analyzing data from a variety of sources (e.g., government and national reports, social media, news outlets) to generate applications such as Healthmap (https://www.healthmap.org/wuhan/). This can also speed up contact tracing by AI pattern recognition within the data, in addition to evaluation and optimization of IPC strategies to prevent further cross infection. Likewise, the AI platform Bluedot (https://bluedot.global/), which includes air travel data, uses natural language processing and machine learning to process vast unstructured text data, in multiple languages, to track outbreaks of over 100 different diseases. Bluedot first alerted on COVID-19 on December 31, 2019, almost a week ahead of national surveillance centers and the WHO. The major advantages of these applications in global outbreaks will also be true for IPC teams at local level, whereby AI data analytics enable IPC and public health experts to focus on strategies to minimize cross infection rather than data gathering and organization into reports.",

AI-enhanced laboratory microscopy could streamline the rapid diagnosis of patients with infection and assist AMR prevention programs by facilitating targeted antimicrobial management and IPC intervention. In one proof of concept study, a convolutional neural network (a type of AI used to analyze visual data) was trained to categorize bacteria in blood culture specimens at the gram stain stage with over 90% accuracy [19\u2022]. Gram stain interpretation can be time-consuming, is strongly operator dependent, and requires a skilled laboratory scientist for interpretation. AI-assisted microscopy opens possibilities for areas without clinical microbiologist expertise with the potential to send images to a central facility for review and appropriate clinical liaison regarding patient management. Machine learning has also been employed in the clinical microbiology laboratory for molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and performed well against traditional gram stain testing [20]. The concept of AI-based microscopy could therefore be extended to other specimens that require gram stain interpretation (e.g., CSF of patients with presumed meningitis), other pathogens such as TB where microscopic diagnosis is an important element of the IPC pathway and to molecular diagnosis of AMR pathogens with IPC implications.",

The kiosk is mobile and when left in one area can be used independently by healthcare staff at a time that suits them, to obtain immediate and individualized performance feedback. More recently the system has been developed into a smartphone app with similar functionality. A pilot of an integrated hand hygiene digital framework which included the SureWash system along with a hand hygiene auditing tool and an activity monitoring system demonstrated the feasibility of using AI without impairing clinical workflow [22]. An integrated \u201crisk status\u201d metric based on live data was presented pictorially in a variety of formats to staff and included actions required to improve the score. Expansion of this dataset to include HAI surveillance data could potentially be incorporated into an AI application to predict future outbreaks and suggest IPC interventions. In an outpatient setting, while machine learning with feedback was associated with improvements in staff hand hygiene before first patient contact, concerns regarding accuracy, long-term sustainability, and user fatigue from repeated notifications were noted [23\u2022].",

In a simulated clinical environment using computer vision with depth images (where a person appears as an outline without distinguishing individual features) for hand hygiene auditing, the system was more successful in detection of alcohol hand rub dispensing and moment one, than detection of hand rubbing [24]. The importance of incorporation of real-time feedback into AI applications to deliver behavior change has been recently highlighted [25\u2022\u2022]. In this study on a surgical ward, automatic video auditing (sink vision monitors) with feedback resulted in improvement in the quality and quantity of handwashing. However performance returned to baseline when feedback was removed. Care must therefore be taken when reminders are provided automatically as staff can become dependent (cognitive offloading); [26] hence, why when hand hygiene reminders and measurement tools are removed, performance returns to baseline [25\u2022\u2022, 27]. Other issues for vision-based systems include privacy (limiting the visual data that can be used, though \u201cedge AI\u201d where the images and identity information are processed locally by an AI on the device may circumvent this), challenges around hospital infrastructure making trajectory prediction and data association difficult, and the unresolved issue of how best to take account of people traffic in real life rather than in the quieter simulation setting [28].",

In one review of technological behavior monitoring systems, hand hygiene improvement varied widely from 6 to 54%, though study results were less clear-cut around sustainability of the improvement [29]. As wearable technologies require staff to continuously wear the technology, user attitude, device functionality, and usability are important factors to consider prior to further development of AI applications around them. For example, if a device is programmed to give the user an auditory or visual reminder, then the ability to override this in particular clinical situations, such as palliative care, is important. Likewise, device design, size, or weight may be perceived as a barrier to providing patient care, or indeed an IPC risk itself given most commercially available wearables which are designed to be worn on the wrist.",

Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life often chaotic clinical setting. AI is highly dependent on data quality and completeness, robust reference standards (which frequently do not exist in IPC), in addition to close collaboration with IPC experts to interpret outputs and ensure clinical relevance. Otherwise, errors that are introduced during the machine learning training process can result in false negatives, misclassification, or lack of applicability. IPC practitioners also need to understand the limitation of AI for a particular application and context. Depending on how data is collected and the learning algorithms are designed, machine learning results can poorly classify new data (under-fitting) or lose the ability to recognize similar patterns in new data (overfitting). They may also reflect the underlying bias in the training data.",

Ideally to achieve a comprehensive view, an AI application may require access to data from all or a variety of these \u201cdata silos\u201d both within and across disparate healthcare organizations [30]. However, most publications on AI in healthcare do not work across this continuum, rather focus on discrete more manageable areas. Indeed, IPC and healthcare generally need to become less fragmented to access these technologies.

Sustainable improvements in IPC require culture and behavior change supported by appropriate governance structures. The consideration that \u201ccorrelation does not imply causation\u201d is particularly relevant when the use of AIs in healthcare is considered. AIs are driven by \u201cbig data\u201d to find the correlations that may indicate medically relevant conditions or to identify potential risk factors. However, AIs can sometimes overlook small clusters that may be clinically relevant and are currently unable to use deep knowledge of the underlying processes to reason about small datasets. Rather than focus on the AI tools themselves, the focus should be on the IPC problem that needs to be addressed with development of strategy, goals, and processes to support this which may include AI. Organizations that have successfully led digital transformations have used this approach, understanding culture and drivers first before choosing appropriate technological tools. In addition, involving insiders that are familiar with the culture, appreciating that one size does not fit all settings, and adopting a flat hierarchy to support rapid iterative modifications are important considerations [31\u2022\u2022]. IPC practitioners need to be aware of the limitations and biases within AI and the tendency of staff to off load tasks on to the AI and be over confident in its abilities. Issues around privacy and data ownership require careful consideration; AI applications need to be tested and integrated into real-life clinical practice and for most healthcare settings, significant investment in data infrastructure is required to truly realize its potential.",
