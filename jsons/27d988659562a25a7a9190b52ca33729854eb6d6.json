This group comprises, in part, togaviruses, negative strand RNA viruses (arena-, rhabdo-, orthomyxo-, and paramyxoviruses) and retroviruses. DNA viruses, such as herpes viruses, which bud from the nuclear membrane, and poxviruses, which manufacture their own envelope, also express structural viral glycoproteins on the cell surface.

After viral entry into a cell and uncoating, transcription of viral mRNA and its translation into viral proteins on host cell ribosomes follow. Enveloped viruses have three main classes of structural proteins: nucleocapsid proteins, matrix (M) proteins, and envelope glycoproteins. The nucleocapsid protein is associated with the viral nucleic acid, the M protein (not present in togaviruses) is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane (see Choppin and Compans, 1975) . The glycoproteins are inserted into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, probably as transmembrane proteins, with a hydrophobic region in (VSV) glycoprotein provides a model for this process (Rothman and Lodish, 1977) . Briefly, the nascent polypeptide chain synthesized on membrane-associated polyribosomes, is inserted through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, insertion apparently being mediated by a specific \"signal\" peptide sequence in the chain in accordance with the \"signal hypothesis\"(Blobe1 and Dobberstein, 1975).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 579, "end": 605, "text": "Choppin and Compans, 1975)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 804, "end": 830, "text": "(Rothman and Lodish, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A.

Viral glycoproteins appear to be mobile in the lipid bilayer, as are host cell integral membrane proteins (see Section 111), and become distributed at random over the surface of the cell. Prior to the process of budding, glycoproteins locate in the area of budding; M protein aligns under the glycoproteins on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, the nucleocapsids also align under the M protein, and the whole complex is then enveloped in a bud of plasma membrane. In the virion, as in the cell, the glycoproteins are thus the exposed viral proteins. The lipid envelope reflects the composition of the cell plasma membrane from which it is derived (Lenard and Compans, 1974) . Most evidence indicates that host cell membrane proteins are almost totally excluded from the viral envelopes during budding (see Holland and Kiehn, 1970) . There is some circumstantial evidence that H-2 antigens can be incorporated into Friend leukemia virus (FLV) (Bubbers and Lilly, 1977) . This was based on adsorption of antisera to H-2 by FLV purified from vireniic mice. However, virus had to be disrupted to demonstrate this adsorption, and there is as yet no firm confirmatory biochemical evidence demonstrating incorporation of gene products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) into enveloped viruses. It does seem definite that cellular actin, a peripheral membrane protein, can be incorporated into some enveloped viruses, e.g., measles virus, VSV, and influenza virus, as demonstrated by its presence in purified virions. However, this is probably a passive association, as exposure of infected cells to cytochalasin B does not prevent incorporation of actin into VSV or influenza virions, or inhibit budding (Griffin and Compans, 1979) .

Rauscher virus gp70 was initially reported to cocap with H-2 on tumor cells (Schrader et al., 1975) . Later, using well defined antisera, it was found that retroviral gp69/71 cocapped with H-2 and with TL on a mouse thymoma line (Bourgignon et al., 1978) . However, in this same study, capping of T200, which is a host cell surface glycoprotein, also induced cocapping of H-2, and of the Thy 1 and TL antigens. This suggested that H-2 antigens may cocap with a variety of independent cell surface molecules, possibly, as postulated in this report, because they are all linked to the actomyosin filaments (Bourgignon et al., Oldstone, unpublished observations) . Furthermore, in a recent careful biochemical study using immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), no evidence for molecular association of MHC molecules and Moloney virus gp70 could be found on a Moloney virus lymphoma line (Fox and Weissman, 1979) . One major interest of these observations is their relevance to the debate on whether cytotoxic T cells recognize MHC products and viral antigen as a complex, or as two independent molecules (see Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1979) . In this context additional evidence arguing against a direct molecular association of H-2 antigens and viral glycoproteins, at least occurring during transcription or translation, is provided b y experiments mixing independently synthesized proteins. Thus, secondary in uitro cytotoxic T cell responses can be generated by liposomes containing isolated H-2 antigens and Sendai viral glycoproteins (Finberget al., 1977) ; and heterokaryons formed by fusing cells bearing SV40 antigens, but inappropriate H-2 antigens, with uninfected cells of appropriate H-2 haplotype, are reported to act as targets for H-2 restricted cytotoxic T cells (Watt and Gooding, 1980) .

(1963, 1967) to describe the reversible loss of the TL+ (thymic leukemia antigen) phenotype from TL+ leukemia cells passaged in immunized mice. These cells lost their sensitivity to lysis when a new source of anti-TL antibody and guinea pig complement was added, but the TL+ phenotype and susceptibility to lysis returned after culture in the absence of antibody or passage in unimmunized mice. Antigenic modulation of TL, and in other tumor systems, is reviewed in detail by Stackpole and Jacobson (1978) . It now seems that a similar phenomenon can occur when virus-infected cells are exposed to antibody, although the mechanism may not necessarily be precisely identical to the TL system. Joseph and Oldstone (1975) found that culture of measles virus-infected HeLa cells in the presence of antibody to measles virus rendered them resistant to lysis when exposed to a fresh source of human antibody and human complement. The authors termed this \"antibodyinduced viral antigenic modulation.\" Antibody-induced measles virus antigenic modulation has subsequently been studied in detail. HeLa cells persistently or acutely infected with measles virus were incubated in heat-inactivated human serum containing antibody to measles virus and then maintained in suspension culture with 20% of the same heat-inactivated human serum. At timed points cells were removed from culture and washed. The infected cells' susceptibility to lysis by human antiviral antibody and complement underwent a progressive decline, which was maximal by 12 hours. This correlated with loss of accessible viral antigens from the cell surface as detected by surface staining with fluoresceinated anti-measles IgG or by binding of radiolabeled antibody (see Fig. 3 ) . After the initial few hours of culture in the presence of antibody, only minimal degrees of cap formation were evident on the measles-infected cells. Acutely infected cells maintained in culture regained their susceptibility to lysis by 48 hours, whereas persistently infected HeLa cells regained susceptibility only if washed and recultured in the absence of antibody. This difference probably reflects the differing rate and density of viral glycoprotein synthesis between the two cell types, the acutely infected cell synthesizing enough viral antigen to eventually bind all the antibody in the experimental system used and escape modulation. Under these , 1975.) same conditions, cells persistently infected with measles virus completely lost their susceptibility to lysis by peripheral blood lymphocytes from immune subjects, within 3 days in culture (Oldstone and Tishon, 1978) .

(1977) with HSV. An alternative explanation would be that antibody is produced by plasma cells in the course of the cytotoxicity assay. After vaccination of human subjects with measles virus or vaccinia virus, Perrin et al. (1977b Perrin et al. ( , 1978 found that cytotoxic PBL were generated. Enhanced lysis of virus-infected targets b y PBL began at day 5, peaked by day 7, and was rapidly dissipated by day 15 after immunization. These induced cytotoxic PBL showed immune specificity. PBL generated after vaccination with measles virus killed measles virusinfected target cells preferentially, but not vaccinia virus-infected targets. Similarly, cytotoxic PBL generated after vaccinia vaccination showed enhanced killing of vaccinia-infected targets, but not of measles virus-infected targets. The target cells used were autologous fibroblasts and homologous and xenogeneic cultured cell lines. PBL cytotoxicity induced by measles virus or vaccinia virus vaccines was not mediated by T cells (E-rosetting cells), but by Fc receptor positive, E rosette negative cells. The specific cytotoxicity for virus-infected target cells was inhibited 95% by F(ab'), antihuman IgG. Further, experiments using different subsets of PBL from immune and nonimmune subjects showed that Fc receptor bearing lymphocytes from either immune or nonimmune persons lysed virus-infected targets in the presence of B cells from immune donors. Hence, two populations within PBL participated in the killing of virus-infected targets. In addition to the Fc receptor positive effector lymphocytes, it is likely that B lymphocytes producing antibody were present. The evidence for antibody playing a role in these circumstances is compelling, but synthesized antibody has not been identified directly. However, PBL from subjects 7 days after immunization or natural infection with influenza virus have recently been shown to secrete specific antibody to the viral hemagglutinin in vitro, coinciding with a peak in cytotoxicity by these PBL against influenza infected target cells (Greenberg et al., 1979) .

ROLE OF VIRAL ANTIGENIC MODULATION in Vivo"}, {"text": "It is not known whether antigenic modulation of virus-infected cells occurs in vivo in man. However, one situation with possible relevance to the in vitro antigenic modulation of measles-infected cells is the disease subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). SSPE is a rare disease characterized by chronic progressive brain damage afflicting children or young adults. Measles virus has been isolated predominantly from the brain and lymphoid tissue by cocultivation techniques, and electron microscopy shows accumulations of measles viral nucleocapsids in brain cells (ter Meulen et al., 1972) . Thus, SSPE is a persistent measles virus infection in man, but the reasons for the latent period of several years between typical measles virus infection and the insidious onset of SSPE as well as for the localization in the brain are unknown. Patients with SSPE have high titers of antibody to measles in their sera and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), but no evidence of impaired antibody and complement killing Joseph et al., 1975) or ADCC (Kreth and ter Meulen, 1977; Per-rin et al., 1977a) of measles virus-infected target cells. CSF has no detectable hemolytic complement, either in normal subjects or in patients with SSPE. We have postulated that in the presence of antibody, but absence of complement or paucity of cytotoxic lymphocytes in local areas of the central nervous system, antibody could modulate viral antigens expressed on infected cell surfaces. This could prevent cell fusion and death and initiate a state of viral persistence. These conditions would provide selective pressure favoring the emergence of mutant viruses, such as temperature-sensitive or defective interfering virus (Oldstone, 1981) . There is experimental evidence suggesting that antibody can be associated with modification of measles infection and facilitation of a persistent infection. Albrecht et d. (1977) found that an SSPE isolate produced a chronic encephalitis in animals with preexisting antibody to measles, compared to an acute fatal disease in animals without antibody. Similarly, Wear and Rapp (1971) found that maternal antibody was required to produce latent brain infection upon inoculation of newborn suckling hamsters with an adapted strain of human measles virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 596, "text": "(ter Meulen et al., 1972)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1028, "text": "Joseph et al., 1975)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1065, "text": "(Kreth and ter Meulen, 1977;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1088, "text": "Per-rin et al., 1977a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1715, "text": "(Oldstone, 1981)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1890, "end": 1896, "text": "(1977)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2100, "text": "(1971)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A.

This has been interpreted as a possible example of antibody-induced antigenic modulation (Stevens and Cook, 1974; Joseph and Oldstone, 1975) .

However, the protective effect of antibody could result from neutralization of free virus rather than any cytotoxic effect on infected cells. Hicks et al.
