Prolonged periods of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA suggest a sustained viral replication in some kinds of host cells in patients with COVID-19. A comparison has previously been made between viral shedding, as quantified by real time PCR (RT-PCR), and median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in patients with influenza.4 The temporal changes in viral load by RT-PCR were similar to that of TCID50.4 For COVID-19, the association between viral load in respiratory tract specimens, quantified by RT-PCR, and viral culture needs evaluation.",
