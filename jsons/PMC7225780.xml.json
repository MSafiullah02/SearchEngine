As of April 5, 2020, while we know that the mortality rate is still significantly higher between men (8%) and women (4.6%) in Spain,6 biological data have found that smoking can upregulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the transmembrane protein serving as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.7 In this regard, emerging data already suggest that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and current smoking (CS) are at increased risk of serious COVID-19 infection, since ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and CS.8 These results have been similarly replicated in rodents.9",

Accordingly, we ask the Spanish government to (1) record and share the tobacco smoking status data of all identified cases of COVID-19. In the meantime, with consumers legally allowed to purchase tobacco products during the lockdown, even in the hardest hit areas of the country,10 we recommend that public health authorities from the Spanish government focus on how to decrease the COVID-19 contraction, transmission, and mortality rates, considering (2) tobacco smoking cessation advice (including COVID-19 context-specific smoking cessation campaigns) and (3) evidence-based tobacco smoking cessation interventions (including taxation increases, interdiction of sales of all forms of tobacco during the pandemic period, or enhancement of nicotine cessation programs).",
