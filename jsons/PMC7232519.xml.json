            "text": "Infections of the respiratory tract are an important cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. In 2016, about 2.38 million people died because of lower respiratory infections. The highest number of deaths occurred among children younger than 5 years and the elderly. Mortality is particularly high in developing countries [1]. Among the respiratory pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus are the leading causes of lower tract respiratory infections [1]. Although bacterial etiology remains the most common cause of pneumonia, respiratory viral infections are responsible for a large number of hospital admissions among healthy adults, immunocompromised patients, and patients with comorbidities [2,3]. While global monitoring of influenza viruses is well established and aims at the development of effective seasonal vaccines against the influenza virus, the monitoring of other respiratory viruses is not always well defined and requires implementation [4]. From this point of view, the use of rapid, sensitive, multiplex PCR-based tests which allow a broad-spectrum screening of respiratory viruses has clinical relevance. A rapid diagnosis will avoid the administration of an unnecessary antibiotic therapy as well as a prompt isolation of the infected patient, avoiding the spread of the infectious agent between critically ill patients in intensive care units or onco-hematological wards.",

The extraction of clinical data was carried out also by analysing hospital discharge sheets through the database of the Hospital Informative System. These data were prepared using the AREAS-ADT information system, using the classification of the ICD-9-CM codes (2007 version) (http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_pubblicazioni_2251_allegato.pdf). The resulting layout was subsequently processed for the evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative variables and of the 3M APR-DRG\u00ae (All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Groups) v. 30.0, that assign to each case a subclass severity of illness or of risk of mortality. The database also included the following variables, that were measured less than 48 h after the respiratory sample collection: flu-like symptoms or other relevant symptoms, presence of fever, hemoglobin values, leukocyte formula and C Reactive Protein (CRP) values.",

Two of us also consulted medical records, when available, in order to gather relevant clinical information (including symptoms) and to enrich information in our database. Consequently, we analysed specific viral agents by month of diagnosis, grouping months in 2 subgroups, cold and not cold months (from November to February and from March to October, respectively). Then we grouped the same class of viruses by the FilmArray assay. Demographic and clinic characteristics, as gender, age groups (18\u201345, 46\u201364, \u226565), type of specimens and ward of admission, mode of discharge, including severity of illness and risk of death (according to 3M APR-DRG v.30.0) from I-less to IV-more serious were calculated for all the positive patients. We also analysed single viral agent both for each age group of the patients and for specific symptoms according what found in the clinical documentation. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated in order to evaluate the association between relevant variable (i.e., females vs males, age, period of diagnosis, severity of illness (SOI), risk of death (ROD), pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, death, hemoglobin, civil status, education, length of stay (LOS), surgical procedure (according to surgical APR-DRG), major diagnostic category (MDC)) to the two most represented viral infections at the univariate level. The variables that were found to be associated at the univariate level with a p-value \u2264 0.15 were included in a multivariate model to adjust the association with the specific viral infection (i.e., the model was used both for influenza and rhino/enterovirus, since they were the two most represented viral infections in our positive patients).",

Among these 112 individuals, 50 (44.6%) were immunosuppressed, whereas the remaining 62 (55.4%) showed normal immunological parameters. The evaluation of the immune status was performed on the basis of the available clinical and laboratory data, such as clinical diagnosis, hospital ward of admission, blood cells count and pharmacological treatments (i.e., chemotherapy, high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressant; data not shown). Most of influenza viruses were detected in immunocompetent patients, whereas rhino/enteroviruses were mainly found in the immunocompromised (Table 5). The percentages reported in Table 5 refer to the number of patients per group. It is worth noting that there were five coinfections in four immunocompetent patients (three individuals with two viruses and one with three viruses) and four coinfections in four immunocompromised patients (four individuals with two virus each).",

The high positivity of the elderly for influenza viruses indicates that an adequate level of vaccination coverage has not yet been reached in this category of individuals. Therefore, they are exposed to the risk of developing severe complications, which are often associated with a poor outcome and require hospitalization, with a consequent increase in public healthcare expenditure. Recent evidence that vaccination coverage is also under the optimal level among hospital physicians and nurses has been recently reported, indicating an additional problem in hospital settings [19].",

They showed a wide distribution over the various months of the year with a greater probability of positivity observed in the non-cold months (O.R. 5.55\u2014p < 0.0001). They were more frequently found in immunocompromised than in the immunocompetent patients, as reported also in the literature [20,21]. It is known that rhinoviruses (RHV) and respiratory enteroviruses (EV) are the leading causes of upper respiratory tract infections and are among the most frequent infectious agents in humans worldwide. Both are classified in the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family and they have been assigned to seven distinct species, RV-A, B, C and EV-A, B, C, D [21]. In addition to an established etiological role in localized self-limiting diseases, such as the common cold, these viruses demonstrate an unexpected capacity to spread to other body sites under certain conditions and have been identified also as the etiologic agent of severe pneumonia in the elderly and immunocompromised patients, other than of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma [20,21].",

It is worth mentioning that marked dyspnea was found in over-64-year-old patients also in case of positivity for other respiratory viruses, i.e., MPV (50%), RHN/EV (55%), FLU (69%) and HCOV (50%). In agreement with the potential severity of RSV infection, a recent prospective observational study conducted in France during three influenza seasons revealed that 4% of adults hospitalized for influenza-like illness (ILI) had RSV infection, of whom 58% developed cardiopulmonary complications and 8% died. It also showed that elderly individuals and patients with cancer and/or treated with immunosuppressive drugs are more likely to have RSV isolated when hospitalized for ILI [14].",

Among non-immune-compromised adults, HPIV infection typically causes mild disease characterized by upper respiratory tract symptoms and it is infrequently associated with severe croup or pneumonia.
