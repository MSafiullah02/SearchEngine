RC should be offered for higher-risk tumors, if hospital capacity allows and if patient comorbidities do not put them at a higher postoperative risk.

In an attempt to offer optimal therapeutic options with inclusion in clinical trials, investigators should carefully evaluate the risks of adding extra delays in treatment initiation due to administrative issues or bureaucratic constraint related to COVID-19 pandemic and extra visits requiring travel associated with a higher risk of infection in this mostly vulnerable population.
