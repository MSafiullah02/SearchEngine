This type of learning is used extensively in viral biology to infer Phylogeny. The unsupervised learning method groups data without any prior knowledge of class labels. After the model is built one can derive knowledge about examples clustered in any specific group. While supervised and unsupervised learning learn from data, the reinforcement learning paradigm learns from experience.

The problem here is to find out the best values of the elements of the weight vector, which maximize separation of the two classes with reference to a given performance measure (e.g. accuracy). This amounts to finding a hyperplane which maximizes the margin. This implies that at the training stage the examples belonging to class1 should be maximally separated from examples belonging to class 2. It can be shown that such a problem can be formulated as a Convex Quadratic Optimization problem [2]. The solution for such a convex optimization problem has only one global optimum as opposed to multiple local optimum solutions (algorithm can get stuck up in any of the inferior local optima) like other candidate algorithms like neural network etc. have. It is this highly beneficial aspect coupled with superior performance has attracted researchers and practitioners from different fields to employ Support Vector Machines. After model building, the weight vectors can be obtained from only a subset of training examples. This subset is known as Support Vectors and hence the name Support Vector Machines. It must be noted here that SVM converts the original \u201cN\u201d dimensional problem into a one dimensional problem using dot products between the examples.",

To handle these data SVM first transforms the data to a higher dimensional feature space and then employs a linear hyperplane. There are two inherent difficulties in the above approach: (i) It is difficult to find a suitable transformation by trial-and-error. (ii) We may have to employ a transformation to a very high dimensional space for reasonable classification accuracy which becomes computationally intractable. To solve these problems SVM employs appropriate kernel functions. Kernel functions are defined as a function of dot products in the original space and they are equivalent to the dot products in the higher dimensional feature space. SVM separating surface can now be defined as a linear hyperplane in the high dimensional feature space and introduction of appropriate kernel functions make it possible to do all the computations in the original space itself. Kernel functions have to satisfy Mercers Theorem; They have to satisfy the axioms of Hilbert space and have to be positive definite. The most popular kernel functions are Polynomial, Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Multi-layer Perceptron kernel functions. Apart from these there are several domain dependent kernel functions. In computational biology, string kernels and Fisher kernels are very popular. Formulation as described above is known as Hard-margin SVM classification.",

Such a hyperplane while classifying the training set very well, over-fits the data and may fail miserably in unseen query test examples. It may be possible to increase the margin with slight loss of training accuracy (Fig. 4). This will generalize better than the one having a narrow margin and has more robust prediction capabilities. This trade-off between margin maximization and misclassification error in soft margin formulations can be obtained by optimizing a new parameter \u2018C\u2019.",

Many problems require a nonlinear model to adequately regress the data. The methodology described in the previous sections can be easily extended to employ SVM to handle nonlinear regression (Sch\u00f6lkopf et al. 1999) [2]. The methodology for linear regression is same as that of conventional models for regression; examples which are linearly classifiable can be done in the original dimension itself. What is different in SVM linear regression is that a novel epsilon-insensitive loss function is defined, which is robust against outliers in the data [3, 4]. For data that cannot be regressed linearly, a principle similar to the one implemented in classification problems can be extended easily; for such kind of problems, data needs to be taken to a higher dimensional feature space and subsequently regressed linearly. Appropriate kernel functions can again be defined to simplify computation.",

QSAR analysis has been playing a key role in screening of compounds by building knowledge-based models [13]. This greatly reduces the experimental screening load. QSAR methodology focuses on finding a model, which allows for correlating the experimentally determined activity of a family of compounds with their molecular structure. Once a high performance model is built, it can be used to identify the activity of any new compound based on appropriate domain attributes extracted from their molecular structure. The set of atoms and covalent bonds between them can define a molecular structure. However, creation of structure-activity relationship models cannot be directly done from the structure of the molecule. Domain information has to be presented to the algorithm in the form of descriptors; molecular descriptors range from physicochemical and quantum-chemical to geometrical and topological features. The methodology of building QSAR models consists of four steps: (a) extracting descriptors from molecular structure (b) choosing most informative descriptors as per activity (c) building a model based on filtered molecular descriptors (d) screening molecule for activity in question. In Table 1, different example of descriptors as listed. These examples are categorised based on structural conformations [13].",

Due to this division number of examples in the positive side of the classifier was much less than the negative side. This created imbalance and reduced classification accuracy. To counter this, the author employs a bootstrap method for repeated sampling and generated different subsets of data. The majority class was further subjected to random sub-sampling. Mathews Correlation coefficient was used as performance measure. The bootstrapping method was able to produce an MCC of 0.696 and above. List of examples are given in Table 2.",

Numbers of sequence reads generated per run has progressively increased with time, due to improved understanding of molecular biology as well as technological advances. Current sequencing platforms are capable of generating enormous numbers of sequence reads in quick turnaround time, allowing researchers to explore all possible aspects of biomedical studies at molecular level and dig deeper in the genetic aspects. NGS has proven to be an efficient, fast and reliable approach to solve problems in studies of evolution, ecology and genetics, overcoming the limitation of traditional molecular approaches [22]. Another great advantage of NGS approach over traditional molecular studies is that it is also cost efficient. End-to-end human genome can be sequenced in few hours using NGS technology, whereas, it took over a decade to sequence and assemble human genome using Sanger Sequencing. Based upon the chemistry, a number of NGS platforms have been developed since last decade. Bioinformatics knowledge plays an important role in assembling the fragments sequenced in parallel by mapping all the read sequences to the human genome reference. Depth of the sequencing, i.e. number of times the template has been sequenced, assures accuracy of sequencing, making sure that observed variation in sequenced data is the result of mutations, and not of sequencing errors. NGS can be used to sequence targeted regions identified in a genetic study, or entire genome including all coding genes (whole exome sequencing).",

Scope of applications also include characterization of the viral community in the environment [30, 31], in animals [32], and viral community in humans [33\u201336]. Due to high replication capacity and low fidelity of the replication enzyme, high intra-host variability is shown by reverse transcriptase-dependent viruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus) and RNA viruses (e.g. hepatitis C virus, influenza virus). Such a set of closely related genomes within a given host allows a viral population to swiftly adapt to dynamic environments and evolve resistance to vaccines and antiviral drugs [37].

The inelastic scattering of light photons by vibrating molecules in the samples is called as Raman scattering. Information about molecular vibrations produced due to change in frequencies of the photons are useful in diagnostic studies. Such change in frequencies are result of interactions of molecular bonds. Initial changes in almost all the types of diseases (including cancer and viral infections) occur at molecular level. Laboratory tests are inadequate in identifying such changes due to some limitations. Raman spectroscopy has the potential to monitor these changes at molecular level at early stage of the disease [46]. Information about abnormalities can be retrieved from the spectral differences between normal and diseased samples, which is used for the purpose of diagnosis. With diverse areas of applications, Spectroscopy is a promising clinical tool for the real-time diagnosis of diseases and assessment of living healthy and cancerous tissue, cells and their subcellular compounds and structures.

For obvious reasons, non-invasive tests e.g. blood tests measuring the markers that are either involved in the synthesis or degradation of extracellular matrix, has to be the preferred alternatives for assessment of hepatic fibrosis. However, the performance of these non-invasive methods is limited in differentiating between mild and moderate stages of fibrosis and in evaluating the effect of treatments on liver fibrosis process. Use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy applied to the serum in the assessment of hepatic fibrosis, was demonstrated by Scaglia et al. [53]. Infrared spectral characteristics exhibited by serum from patients, were employed in differentiation of chronic hepatitis C patients with extensive hepatic fibrosis from those without fibrosis and thus predicting the degree of hepatic fibrosis. With leave-one-out cross-validation, the accuracy achieved was 97.7%.",

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is the physical & functional interactions of proteins that controls wide range of molecular processes in a cell, like signal transduction, cell-cell communication, transcription, replications etc. [79]. PPIs can be responsible for altering kinetic properties of enzyme, modifying proteins activity, changing specificity of protein binding, constructing new binding sites and regulatory function. Alteration or malfunction of these interactions can lead to diseases [79]. The collection of all the protein-protein interaction of cell or an organism is called interactome. The study of PPIs can help in predicting a biological process involving protein of unknown function, fasten the pace of understanding functional pathways or to know biochemistry of a cell [77, 79, 80].

Many PPIs are involved between virus and host during a viral infection where the virus proteins take over the host transcriptional machinery [78]. It has been believed that viral proteins bind to the host protein that are highly connected [81]. Endogenous interface, with respect to virus-host systems, are responsible for interactions in their own system i.e. host-host PPI and virus-virus PPI. On the other hand, exogenous interfaces are responsible of virus-host interactions. Both virus and host compete for endogenous and exogenous interfaces [81]. Mutations at protein interfaces can reduce or increase their binding affinities by changing protein electrostatics and structural properties. Virus and host proteins change their surface resides through mutations as an evolutionary result to compete for binding partner. However, host tends to be less variable than viruses. Viruses diversify through various modes of molecular evolution, including conservation, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication and molecular mimicry [81]. Viral proteins constantly inhibit host-host interactions and therefore, blocking such interactions between virus & host can aid in biomedical applications by identification of drug targets and developing antiviral therapies [81]. For e.g. a drug, Maraviroc, binds the cellular co-receptor CCR5, a receptor on white blood cells involved in immune system, preventing it from interacting with GP120 of HIV1 which is essential for entry of HIV-1 in host [82]. As viruses pose a global threat, understanding of virus & human PPIs can help in development of vaccines for treatment .",

RFAT generates fixed length for variable length proteins and enables models to achieve a better accuracy. In this study, a vector based on AA triplets & biochemical similarity is generated. Based on biochemical properties of AA residues, 6 categories are defined as {IVLM}, {FYW}, {HKR}, {DE}, {QNTP}, and {ACGS}. Using this classification of AA s, there are 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 216 possible AA triplets [86]. The protein sequence is converted into AA triplets and the vector of 216 length is created that contains the frequency of each category in sequences of variable length. LIBSVM [87] was used to generate model with the radial basis function (RBF) as a kernel function. For dataset, HCV & human interaction data was extracted from the infection mapping project (I-MAP) whereas for HPV, data was extracted from NCBI Bio Systems Database.

With 7 categories 343 (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7) AA triplets are possible. RFAT feature vector had 686 elements i.e. 343 for host and 343 for virus. Zhou et al. [78] uses more features as frequency difference of AA triplets (FDAT) between virus and host proteins, AA composition (AC) in each pair of host and virus proteins, normalized frequency of each AA group, transition and distribution of AA groups. As a result of these 6 features, a feature vector of length 1175 was created. Again, LIBSVM [87] with RBF was used to develop model. Best performance was obtained with combination of all these 6 features with accuracy of 85.64% (see sr. no. 4 of Table 7).",

In Virology, Microarray is used to screen viruses for which genomes are available in GenBank by looking at the conserved viral sequences. Microarray gene expression profiles are also used to detect the immune response that can further help in classifying disease caused by viruses, that is conventionally done using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR).
