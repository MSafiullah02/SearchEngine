Most studies of viral epidemiology use hospital-based surveillance because community-based surveillance is difficult and expensive. However, hospital-based surveillance tends to capture only the most severe illness and many cases are missed in developing countries because of limited hospital access. Our analysis avoided these limitations and allowed us to capture the burden of virus-associated ILI in communities. Understanding community epidemiology is essential to implement effective control measures. Other advantages of being part of a clinical trial included a well-characterized population, wide age range up to 10 years, samples taken from a high proportion of children, consistent methodology between countries, and use of sensitive and validated PCR assays.",

In addition, our study did not include any children aged <6 months and only a limited number of children aged 6\u201311 months, so our findings are mainly relevant to older children. Fever was part of the ILI definition, and therefore we would have missed cases in children with no fever. To put this into perspective, in the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project, 34% and 43% of cases among children aged 1\u20134 years and 5\u201317 years, respectively, met the ARTI definition which did not require fever, but did not meet the ILI definition which did require fever.18 However, our definition of ILI was somewhat broader (except in children under 2 years of age) and US data may not be generalizable to the tropical and southern hemisphere countries in our study. The inclusion of only healthy children in the study and the exclusion of cases with no fever would have underestimated the burden. We also could not discriminate between rhinovirus and enterovirus by PCR, therefore the exact prevalence and incidence of each one could not be determined. Finally, our study included only a small number of pneumonia cases (n = 20), limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the distribution of viral infection in these cases. The overall pneumonia detection rate in the clinical trial (0.9%) is higher than, but in line with, what has been reported in the US for hospitalized cases.24 However, our sample collection rate among pneumonia cases was only 62.5% compared with 80.0% for ILI overall.",

A considerable amount of the burden would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance. These novel data fill an important gap in our knowledge of the epidemiology of viruses contributing to the substantial burden of respiratory disease in children, and may be useful in informing priorities for implementation of existing vaccine programs and development of new vaccines.",
