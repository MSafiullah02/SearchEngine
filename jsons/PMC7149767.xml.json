VPg (virion protein genome-linked) is covalently linked to both the genomic and the subgenomic RNAs. The ORF1 polyprotein encoded by the genomic RNA encodes nonstructural proteins such as 3CLPRO and RdRp that are essential for viral RNA replication. On the other hand, the subgenomic RNA encodes the structural proteins such as VP1 and VP2. Unlike picornaviruses, internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element is not found in the 5\u2032 NCR. Instead, the VPg recruits eIF4E, a cap-binding translation initiation factor, to initiate translation (Box 13.1\n). In other words, the VPg substitutes for the cap structure in recruiting host translation factors.Box 13.1VPg of Norovirus in TranslationVPg is linked to the 5\u2032 terminus of norovirus RNAs, which is a reminiscent of picornavirus. However, unlike picornavirus, the IRES element, which is essential for the cap-independent translation, is not present in the 5\u2032 NCR of norovirus RNAs. An immediate question is then how norovirus genome RNA is translated. Surprisingly, it was found that VPg has the ability to bind eIF4E and, in doing so, it facilitates the translation initiation of viral RNAs in eIF4E-dependent manner. In other words, VPg substitutes the role of the cap structure of eukaryotic mRNAs in recruiting eIF4E, a cap-binding protein. Overall, norovirus co-opts the cellular eIF4E-dependent translation mechanism via a novel VPg-eIF4E interaction.\n",
