            "text": "Under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), recommendations and common practices regarding face mask use by the general public have varied greatly and are in rapid flux: Mask use by the public in public spaces has been controversial in the US, although as of April 3, 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending the public wear cloth masks. Public mask use is far more prevalent in many Asian countries, which have longer experience with novel coronavirus epidemics; public mask use may have been effective at limiting community spread during the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lau, Tsui, Lau, & Yang, 2004; Wu et al., 2004), and widespread mask use is a prominent feature of the relatively successful COVID-19 response in Taiwan (Wang, Ng, & Brook, 2020), for example. Masks have also been suggested as a method for limiting community transmission by asymptomatic or at least clinically undetected carriers (Chan & Yuen, 2020), who may be a major driver of transmission of COVID-19 (Li et al., 2020). Various experimental studies suggest that masks may both protect the wearer from acquiring various infections (Davies et al., 2013; Lai, Poon, & Cheung, 2012) or transmitting infection (Dharmadhikari et al., 2012). Medical masks (i.e., surgical masks and N95 respirators) in healthcare workers appear to consistently protect against respiratory infection under metanalysis (MacIntyre et al., 2017; Offeddu, Yung, Low, & Tam, 2017), although clinical trials in the community have yielded more mixed results (Canini et al., 2010; Cowling et al., 2009; MacIntyre et al., 2009). While medical-grade masks should be prioritized for healthcare providers, homemade cloth masks may still afford significant, although variable and generally lesser, protection (Davies et al., 2013; van der Sande, Teunis, & Sabel, 2008), but clinical trials in the community remain lacking.",

The traditional model for respiratory disease transmission posits infection via infectious droplets (generally 5\u201310 \u03bcm) that have a short lifetime in the air and infect the upper respiratory tract, or finer aerosols, which may remain in the air for many hours (Leung et al.,2020 ), with ongoing uncertainties in the relative importance of these modes (and in the conceptual model itself Bourouiba, 2020) for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Bourouiba, 2020; Han, Lin, Ni, & You, 2020). The WHO (World Health Organization, 2020, p. 27) has stated that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is primarily via coarse respiratory droplets and contact routes. An experimental study (van Doremalen et al., 2020) using a nebulizer found SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable in aerosols (<5 \u03bcm) for 3 h (the study duration), but the clinical relevance of this setup is debatable (World Health Organization, 2020, p. 27). One out of three symptomatic COVID-19 patients caused extensive environmental contamination in (Ong et al., 2020), including of air exhaust outlets, though the air itself tested negative.",

Medical masks were potentially highly effective as both source control and primary prevention under tidally breathing and coughing conditions in manikin studies (Lai et al., 2012; Patel, Skaria, Mansour, & Smaldone, 2016), with higher quality masks (e.g. N95 respirator vs. surgical mask) offering greater protection (Patel et al., 2016). It is largely unknown to what degree homemade masks (typically made from cotton, teacloth, or other polyesther fibers) may protect against droplets/aerosols and viral transmission, but experimental results by Davies et al. 7 suggest that while the homemade masks were less effective than surgical masks, they were still markedly superior to no mask. A clinical trial in healthcare workers (MacIntyre et al., 2015) showed relatively poor performance for cloth masks relative to medical masks.",

Most mathematical models of the COVID-19 pandemic can broadly be divided into either population-based, SIR (Kermack-McKendrick)-type models, driven by (potentially stochastic) differential equations (Li et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020; Calafiore, Novara, & Possieri, 2020; Simha, Prasad, & Narayana, 2020; Dehning et al., 2020; Nesteruk, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Anastassopoulou, Russo, Tsakris, & Siettos, 2020; Moore & Okyere, 2004), or agent-based models (Biswas, Khaleque, & Sen, 2020; Chang, Harding, Zachreson, Cliff, & Prokopenko, 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020; Ruiz Estrada & Koutronas, 2020; Wilder et al., 2020), in which individuals typically interact on a network structure and exchange infection stochastically. One difficulty of the latter approach is that the network structure is time-varying and can be difficult, if not impossible, to construct with accuracy. Population-based models, alternatively, may risk being too coarse to capture certain real-world complexities. Many of these models, of course, incorporate features from both paradigms, and the right combination of dynamical, stochastic, data-driven, and network-based methods will always depend on the question of interest.",

They additionally estimated that, on a per person basis, asymptomatic individuals were only 55% as contagious, yet were responsible for 79% of new infections, given their increased prevalence. The importance of accounting for asymptomatic individuals has been confirmed by other studies (Calafiore et al., 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020; Moriarty, 2020; Verity et al., 2020). In their model-based assessment of case-fatality ratios, Verity et al. (2020) estimated that 40\u201350% of cases went unidentified in China, as of February 8, 2020, while in the case of the Princess Diamond cruise ship, 46.5% of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 were asymptomatic (Moriarty, 2020). Further, Calafiore et al. (2020), using a modified SIR-model, estimated that, on average, cases in Italy went underreported by a factor of 63, as of March 30, 2020.",

There is also a potentially strong nonlinear effect of mask use on the epidemiologic outcomes of cumulative death and peak hospitalizations. We note a possible temporal effect: Delaying mass mask adoption too long may undermine its efficacy. Moreover, we perform simulated case studies using mortality data for New York and Washington state. These case studies likewise suggest a beneficial role to mass adoption of even poorly effective masks, with the relative benefit likely greater in Washington state, where baseline transmission is less intense. The absolute potential for saving lives is still, however, greater under the more intense transmission dynamics in New York state. Thus, early adoption of masks is useful regardless of transmission intensities, and should not be delayed even if the case load/mortality seems relatively low.",

We assume that some fraction of symptomatic infectious individuals progress to the hospitalized class, H(t), where they are unable to pass the disease to the general public; we suppose that some fraction of hospitalized patients ultimately require critical care (and may die) (Zhou et al., 2020), but do not explicitly disaggregate, for example, ICU and non-ICU patients. Based on these assumptions and simplifications, the basic model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is given by the following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations:(1)dSdt=\u2212\u03b2(t)(I+\u03b7A)SN,(2)dEdt=\u03b2(t)(I+\u03b7A)SN\u2212\u03c3E,(3)dIdt=\u03b1\u03c3E\u2212\u03c6I\u2212\u03b3II,(4)dAdt=(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03c3E\u2212\u03b3AA,(5)dHdt=\u03c6I\u2212\u03b4H\u2212\u03b3HH,(6)dRdt=\u03b3II+\u03b3AA+\u03b3HH,(7)dDdt=\u03b4H,where(8)N=S+E+I+A+R,is the total population in the community, and \u03b2(t) is the baseline infectious contact rate, which is assumed to vary with time in general, but typically taken fixed. Additionally, \u03b7 accounts for the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic carriers (in comparison to symptomatic carriers), \u03c3 is the transition rate from the exposed to infectious class (so 1/\u03c3 is the disease incubation period), \u03b1 is the fraction of cases that are symptomatic, \u03c6 is the rate at which symptomatic individuals are hospitalized, \u03b4 is the disease-induced death rate, and \u03b3A, \u03b3I and \u03b3H are recovery rates for the subscripted population.",

This general pattern holds regardless of \u03b20, but the point of no return is further in the future for smaller \u03b20.",

With this study, we hope to help inform this debate by providing insight into the potential community-wide impact of widespread face mask use by members of the general population. We have designed a mathematical model, parameterized using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in two US states (New York and Washington), and our model suggests nontrivial and possibly quite strong benefits to general face mask use. The population-level benefit is greater the earlier masks are adopted, and at least some benefit is realized across a range of epidemic intensities. Moreover, even if they have, as a sole intervention, little influence on epidemic outcomes, face masks decrease the equivalent effective transmission rate (\u03b20 in our model), and thus can stack with other interventions, including social distancing and hygienic measures especially, to ultimately drive nonlinear decreases in epidemic mortality and healthcare system burden. It bears repeating that our model results are consistent with the idea that face masks, while no panacea, may synergize with other non-pharmaceutical control measures and should be used in combination with and not in lieu of these.",

Our conclusion runs counter to the notion that general public masks are primarily useful in preventing asymptomatically wearers from transmitting disease: Masks are valuable as both source control and primary prevention. This may be important to emphasize, as some people who have self-isolated for prolonged periods may reasonably believe that the chance they are asymptomatically infected is very low and therefore do not need a mask if they venture into public, whereas our results indicate they (and the public at large) still stand to benefit.",

Several lines of evidence support the notion that masks can interfere with respiratory virus transmission, including clinical trials in healthcare workers (MacIntyre et al., 2017; Offeddu et al., 2017), experimental studies as reviewed in (Davies et al., 2013; Dharmadhikari et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2016; van der Sande et al., 2008), and case control data from the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lau et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2004). Given the demonstrated efficacy of medical masks in healthcare workers (Offeddu et al., 2017), and their likely superiority over cloth masks in MacIntyre et al. (2015), it is clearly essential that healthcare works be prioritized when it comes to the most effective medical mask supply. Fortunately, our theoretical results suggest significant (but potentially highly variable) value even to low quality masks when used widely in the community.",

Such contact likely exposes the workers to many asymptomatic carriers, and they may in turn, if asymptomatic, expose many susceptible members of the general public to potential transmission. Air exposed to multiple infectious persons (e.g. in grocery stores) could also carry a psuedo-steady load of infectious particles, for which masks would be the only plausible prophylactic (Lai et al., 2012). Thus, targeted, highly effective mask use by service workers may be reasonable. We are currently extending the basic model framework presented here to examine this hypothesis.",

Despite uncertainty, the potential for benefit, the lack of obvious harm, and the precautionary principle lead us to strongly recommend as close to universal (homemade, unless medical masks can be used without diverting healthcare supply) mask use by the general public as possible.",
