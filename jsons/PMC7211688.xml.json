Regimens vary but are generally equivalent to 400 to 1200 mg hydroxychloroquine (250 to 1000 mg chloroquine phosphate) per day for approximately five days.1 However, these medications can cause QT prolongation,2 the electrocardiographic marker of delayed ventricular repolarization. Delayed repolarization enables early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which can trigger a possibly fatal ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes. Most medications that prolong the QT interval, including aminoquinolines, act by binding to and inhibiting the potassium channel protein product of the gene KCNH2 (also known as hERG), thereby blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr).3 Repolarization is also maintained by other currents, and it is believed that people with impaired function of these additional currents (such as IKs) are at greater risk of drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades.4 This state, known as one of reduced repolarization reserve, can be brought on by risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Bradycardia and heart failure are other risk factors which promote torsades (Table 1\n).5\n",

            "text": "Hence, there is concern about ventricular arrhythmias stemming from the newfound use of these agents. On one hand, clinical experience with these medications in the Western world is generally with chronic conditions such as lupus. Due to their long half-life (approximately one month),6 chronic usage of these drugs will result in more accumulation and greater concentrations than short-term doses, with theoretical time to steady-state being roughly four months. Accordingly, the shorter regimens used to treat COVID-19 may be safer. On the other hand, patients with COVID-19 may represent a population at greater arrhythmic risk given the high frequency of myocardial injury, heart failure and concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications.7 For instance, most protocols suggest combination with azithromycin, another QT-prolonging agent. Yet both agents may affect repolarization reserve in ways beyond IKr alone.8 Moreover, interleukin-6 impairs IKr and hypoxia may also increase the late sodium current (ILATE). Accordingly, more severely ill COVID-19 patients may be more predisposed to a synergistic torsadogenic effect.9\n,\n10\n",

There is warrant for the concern that COVID-19 patients are a population particularly vulnerable to drug-induced long QT syndrome and arrhythmia. Our included studies indicate that COVID-19 patients treated with these agents are older than participants in malaria studies, with mean subject ages of 46.9 and 20.8 years, respectively, and with more baseline comorbidities. COVID-19 patients have a high frequency of directly arrhythmic risk factors, such as sepsis, multi-organ failure, hypoxia, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and use of other QT-prolonging agents (e.g., azithromycin, SSRIs, amiodarone). Moreover, COVID-19 may also induce indirect risk factors, such as acute kidney injury, which can cause accumulation of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to toxic levels,26 and which one included study noted had the best predictive value for QT prolongation.21\n",

In COVID-19 patients, however, approximately 10% of patients developed QT prolongation to a degree that generally leads to the drug being withdrawn (QTc \u2265 500 ms or change > 60 ms). Although COVID-19 itself may be a confounding factor in this comparison, one pre-print of a non-consecutive case series of COVID-19 patients performed by Ramireddy and colleagues showed greater QTc prolongation with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (17 \u00b1 39 ms) relative to azithromycin alone (0.5 \u00b1 40 ms). It is also notable that a randomized trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 patients reported only one instance of QT prolongation among 95 patients treated with this combination, and no instances among 99 receiving standard care.27 While this is an indirect comparison, the considerably smaller proportion with QT prolongation in this population suggests that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine play an important role in QT prolongation in COVID-19 patients.",

While the authors of this study did not report a causality assessment, a causative role of chloroquine is suggested by the lack of events in the lower-dose arm (750 mg twice daily on first day, then 750 mg/day) of this randomized trial. Nonetheless, the low number of events prevents definitive conclusions about causality. While there was report of two conduction abnormalities with unclear causation, no ventricular arrhythmias were reported at any lower dose, which suggests the relative cardiac safety of these agents when used at typical doses, provided regular ECG monitoring is performed.",

This requires particular caution in the study of rare toxicities, where even a single missed event can significantly change estimates of risk. Publication and reporting bias, previously observed in reporting of harms,28 may also contribute to underestimation of risk. Moreover, most included data came from pre-prints which have not gone under peer review, meaning this data is preliminary and possibly more susceptible to such biases.",

One study of 40 ICU patients in France treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for 10 days (with or without azithromycin) noted that 14 (36%) developed QT prolongation, albeit with no arrhythmias reported.29 However, another recent study of 90 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, despite more closely agreeing with our review\u2019s estimate of QT prolongation incidence (20%), also reported an event of torsades de pointes in a patient given hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.30 This event occurred three days after these drugs were discontinued, and other risk factors were present, such as bradycardia, new-onset cardiomyopathy, and use of propofol, a drug that is considered a known risk factor for torsades de pointes.31 Thus, the role played by hydroxychloroquine is uncertain. Nevertheless, given that the long half-lives of these agents still implicate them as possible contributors, at the very least this provides a reminder that even a small number of newly reported events could considerably shift risk estimates and, thus, risk-benefit analyses.",

As drug-induced QT prolongation was observed early in some included studies, daily ECG monitoring should be considered in all patients regardless of baseline QTc, particularly patients with other risk factors for torsades (see Table 1). Where a lack of resources limit 12-lead ECG placement, alternatives include mobile devices such as the KardiaMobile 6L or telemetry. When these are not available, a possible alternative is proactive monitoring and correction (where possible) of risk factors. While more reliable safety data in COVID-19 is expected soon from still-ongoing large randomized trials, even ruling out, e.g., a 0.1% risk, will still require data on at least 3700 treated patients without any episodes of arrhythmia.32 Our results accordingly lend greater support to the more cautious guidance documents for the near future and are in line with recent guidance from the FDA discouraging hydroxychloroquine use outside of a hospital or trial setting where close supervision is available.33\n",
