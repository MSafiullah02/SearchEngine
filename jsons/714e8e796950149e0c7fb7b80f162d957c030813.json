The first report of Q1 genotype in Italy occurred in 2011 and a deep molecular investigation of a Q1 isolated in Italy in 2013 has led to speculation regarding the origin of this genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 sequence of a Q1 Italian strain revealed a close relationship with sequences of the 624I strains circulating in Italy in the early 1990s and this led to the idea that 624I was an ancestor of the Q1 genotype. Despite the fact that most heterogeneity of IBVs occurs in the S1 gene, the sequence analysis of this gene alone was not sufficient to confirm or deny this hypothesis. In the present study, an Italian 624I (gammaCoV/AvCov/Ck/Italy/IP14425/96) was fully sequenced for the first time and compared to all available complete Q1 genome sequences. This analysis confirmed the genetic correlation between GammaCoV/AvCov/Ck/Italy/IP14425/ 96 and Q1 strains, suggesting a common origin between 624I and Q1 genotypes.",

It is caused by a Gammacoronavirus called Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and has a positive sense single-stranded 27.6 kb RNA genome (Jackwood & De Wit, 2013) . The IBV genome can evolve rapidly by mutation and recombination events, resulting in the emergence of new IBV variants which sometimes confer minimal or negligible cross-protection (de Wit et al., 2011) . A majority of such variants cause a transitory problem, which then disappear or remain confined into a specific geographical region. However, a few variants can persist and spread to new areas where they continue to cause disease (Jackwood, 2012; de Wit et al., 2011) .",

It was first detected in China in 1996 (Yu et al., 2001) and then reported in Asia, Middle East, Europe, and South America (Ababneh, Dalab, Alsaad, & Al-Zghoul, 2012; Huang, Lee, Cheng, & Wang, 2004; Jackwood, 2012; Marandino et al., 2015; Rimondi et al., 2009) . In Italy, the Q1 genotype was reported for the first time in 2011 after causing an outbreak of disease associated with respiratory signs, increased mortality, kidney lesions, and proventriculitis (Toffan et al., 2013) . Since then, the genotype has been continuously detected in Italy (Massi et al., 2015) . Phylogenetic analysis performed using full or partial S1 sequences showed a high identity (>99%) with Chinese Q1 isolates (Franzo et al., 2015; Massi et al., 2015; Toffan et al., 2013) . At a similar period, a high identity (94.1%) between those strains and strains belonging to the 624I genotype was observed (Franzo et al., 2015; Massi et al., 2015) , such that the recently proposed new IBV nomenclature based on the S1 sequence placed them in the same lineage (GI-16) (Valastro et al., 2016) . IBV 624I had been reported for the first time in Italy in 1993 (Capua, Gough, Mancini, Casaccia, & Weiss, 1994; Capua et al., 1999) , producing disease associated with kidney lesions and drop in egg production in breeders and layers (Capua, Grasso, Ferdinandi, Weiss, & Casaccia, 1996) . This genotype continued to be detected in Italy until 2004 and then reappeared from 2010 when it was again detected in a few broiler farms affected by respiratory disease located in different areas of Italy. In the following years, the number of detections increased (Massi, 2013) but since 2013 the 624I genotype has not been further detected (Massi et al., 2015) .",

Crossover sites indicating sharp changes in pairwise identity are pointed out by arrows. (a) Comparisons among the putative recombinant CK/CH/LDL/97I show sharp changes in the pairwise identity within the 1a gene, H120 vaccine strain FJ888351 has been identified as putative parental strains for that genomic region. (b) Comparison among the putative recombinant gammaCoV/Ck/Italy/I2022/13 shows sharp changes in the pairwise identity within the 1a gene; strain gammaCoV/AvCov/Ck/Italy/P14425I/96 has been identified as major parental strain for that region.

The basal location of the 624I strain in both the phylogenetic trees, coupled with the epidemiological data available, suggests that this genotype might have played a role in the emergence of Chinese Q1. This model requires long-distance intercontinental dispersion of the 624I genotype and this possibility is supported by its ability to circulate for extended periods within the same country (Taddei et al., 2012) and beyond a geographical area (Capua et al., 1999; Krapez et al., 2010 (Bochkov et al., 2006) . Further investigations are needed since, despite the IBV worldwide dissemination has been observed and accepted for other genotypes (Franzo et al., 2017) , the mechanism behind this evidence is not fully understood.",
