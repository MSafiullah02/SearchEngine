In late December 2019, several patients in Wuhan, China started reporting symptoms that resembled pneumonia. A new virus was identified and initially called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The World Health Organization (WHO) eventually changed the name of the virus to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. The disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus that originates from the Coronaviridae family. Other viruses from the same family include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which appeared in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was reported in 2012 [2]. Since the virus is spreading worldwide, on March 11, 2020, the WHO officially described the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic.",

The S protein allows the virus to bind to the host\u2019s cell membrane. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells have been found to be the target of S proteins. It then undergoes structural changes to fuse with the host, and this eventually allows viral genes to enter the host cell [5-7].",

Hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can also be used as an alternative. The public has also been told to avoid touching mucosal surfaces such as the mouth and the nose with hands that have not been washed. Anyone showing symptoms of the virus should try to seek appropriate medical help. They should also limit their exposure to other unaffected people and cover their noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing. They are also advised to wear a facemask if they present with symptoms. Frequent disinfection and cleaning are advised for groups that are at risk of contracting the virus [24].",
