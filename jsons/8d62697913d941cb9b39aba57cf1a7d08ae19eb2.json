The common 5'-terminal leader sequence, 93 nucleotides (nt) in TGEV, is fused to the 5' end of the mRNA coding sequence (body) by a discontinuous transcription mechanism. Sequences preceding each gene represent signals for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). These are the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) that include a conserved core sequence (CS; 5'-CUAAAC-3'), identical in all TGEV genes (CS-B), and the 5' and 3' flanking sequences (5' TRS and 3' TRS, respectively) that regulate transcription 52 (Fig.  3) . As this CS sequence is also found at the 3' end of the leader sequence (CS-L), it could base pair with the nascent minus strand complementary to each CS-B (cCS-B). In fact, the requirement for base pairing during transcription has been formally demonstrated in arteriviruses 53,54 complement of CS-B was engineered in infectious genomic cDNAs. 55 The canonical CS was nonessential for the generation of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), but its presence led to transcription levels at least 10 3 -fold higher than its absence. The data obtained are compatible with a model of transcription that includes three steps ( The role in transcription of four nucleotides immediately flanking the CS both at the 5' and 3' ends has been studied using a transcriptionally inactive canonical CS (CS-S2) internal to the S gene. 56 The rationale for selecting 5' and 3' TRS flanking sequences consisting of four nucleotides comes from the results of an in silico analysis showing that to predict both viral mRNAs and alternative mRNAs at noncanonical junction sites, an optimal TRS-L should include the CS plus four nucleotides flanking the CS at both ends. These predictions have been supported by experimental data performed by reverse genetic analysis of the sequences immediately flanking CS-S2. A good correlation was observed between the free energy of the TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation and the levels of subgenomic mRNA-S2, demonstrating that base pairing between leader and body beyond the CS was a determinant in the regulation of CoV transcription. In TRS mutants with increasing complementarity between TRS-L and cTRS-B, a tendency to reach a plateau in \u2206G values was observed, suggesting that a more precise definition of the TRS limits might be proposed, consisting of the central CS and approximately four nucleotides flanking 5' and 3' the CS.

As hnRNPA1 interacts with some serine-arginine (SR)-rich proteins, 73 and because N protein also contains an SR motif, 77, 78 it has been proposed that hnRNPA1 interacts directly with N protein to bring the leader RNA to the CS sequence of the template RNA for initiation of subgenomic mRNA transcription. In fact, it has been shown 74 that N protein interacts with hnRNPA1 both in vivo and in vitro. The data was confirmed using the two-hybrid system. In agreement with these results, we have shown by Far-Western blotting that TGEV N protein binds PTB. 79 Template switch during transcription may be aided by the chaperone activity of CoV N protein. During negative-strand RNA synthesis, a template switch is required to add a negative copy of the leader to the negative strand. This process represents a displacement of the former template RNA by another one, the leader sequence. These types of processes need to overcome an energy barrier threshold. RNA chaperones are RNA binding proteins that may help to overcome this threshold. We have shown that TGEV N protein is an RNA chaperone that is also active in viral RNA annealing (Zu\u00f1iga et al. in this book 79 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 154, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 155, "end": 157, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 257, "end": 259, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 462, "end": 464, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 514, "end": 517, "text": "77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 518, "end": 520, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 950, "end": 952, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1559, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CoV TRANSCRIPTION"}, {"text": "(iii) PTB binds to the c3'-untranslated region (UTR) of MHV inducing a conformational change in RNA structure. 68 Mutations of the PTB-binding site in either 5'-leader or the sequences complementary to 3'-UTR inhibited replication and transcription of MHV genomic and defective-interfering (DI) RNA, in direct proportion to the extent of reduction of PTB binding, suggesting that PTB plays a role in regulating viral RNA synthesis. Thus, the interaction of N protein with PTB may modulate transcription. 63 (iv) SYNCRIPT (p70) is a member of the hnRNP family and localizes largely in the cytoplasm. The p70 cross-linked to MHV positive-or negative-strand RNA. The p70binding site was mapped to the leader sequence of the 5'-UTR, requiring the UCUAA repeat sequence. Overexpression of p70 inhibited syncytium formation induced by MHV. Furthermore, downregulation of the endogenous p70 with a specific short iRNA delayed MHV RNA synthesis. These results suggest that p70 may be directly involved in MHV RNA replication as a positive regulator. 80 (v) EAV nsp1 has been proposed to couple genome replication and transcription. 81 Nsp-1 has been shown to interact with p100, 58 and nsp1-p100 interactions have been speculated to be important for viral sgRNA synthesis, either directly or by recruiting a p100 binding protein to the viral RdRp complex. Alternatively, nsp1 might modulate transcription in the infected cell, explaining why the protein is targeted to the nucleus. 10 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 113, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 504, "end": 506, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1044, "text": "80", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1476, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CoV TRANSCRIPTION"}, {"text": "The precise role of the described protein and other viral and cellular proteins needs to be confirmed in the context of discontinuous transcription during the synthesis of the negative strand, giving special attention to intermediates of the replicase processing and to proteins associated with membrane structures located in the cytoplasm.
