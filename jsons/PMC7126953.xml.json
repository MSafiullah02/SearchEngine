Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses (Zumla et al. 2015), with human pathogenic strains resulting in a common cold to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (Casta\u00f1o-Rodriguez et al. 2018). MERS-CoV, an emerging zoonotic virus (Alamoudi et al., 2018, Cong et al., 2018) is pathogenic in human, resulting in shortness of breath, cough, fever, diarrhea, and frequently pneumonia (Cong et al., 2018, Sherbini et al., 2017). The exact animal origin of MERS-CoV is not fully understood, but the transmission pattern and the evidence from virologic studies suggest that it may have originated in bats and was transmitted to camels sometime in the distant past (Hu et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2014, World Health Organization).",

For example, Hunter et al. found an overall CFR of 67% in the Abu Dhabi (Hunter et al. 2016) and Petersen et al. found an overall CFR of 40% in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Petersen et al. 2014) However, our estimates were higher than the largest MERS outbreak in South Korea (CFR of 21%) (Cowling et al. 2015). Our analyses of the WHO data was approximately similar to the CFR of 34% reported by Memish et al. (Memish et al. 2014), and also CFR of 30.5% declared by Mobaraki et al. (Mobaraki and Ahmadzadeh 2019a). The regional variation of CFR from previously conducted studies may be skewed due to severity of disease and smaller sample sizes than have been investigated previously. On the whole, the CFR of 32% related to the MERS-CoV infection in the present study should be considered as a major health concern at the global scale. Thus, the characteristics of this disease and the potential risk factors associated with patient fatality should be studied comprehensively. Our findings confirm that the mortality pattern of the MERS in Saudi Arabia is different from the observed countries in the Middle East and affected countries beyond. By far, the greatest burden of this disease in terms of mortality and morbidity rates is located in four countries including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan. In this regards, differences in the virus and the genetic background of the population affected can play a role. Other reasons can include a difference in the availability or ability to implement patient isolation procedures as well as differences in overall medical technology among involved countries.",

            "text": "Consistent with the previous reports, age range >30 years is associated with death in cases of MERS-CoV infection (Alzeer, 2009, Gautret et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2014). This finding is in line with a Saudi Arabian case report series. It showed that the age range of the individuals (>30 years) had a greater association with mortality and per every 1-year increase in age, the odds of mortality increased by 12% (Majumder et al. 2015). The reason for the higher fatality rates in this age range is unclear, but they may have underlying diseases and impaired immune functions that exacerbate the symptom of MERS-CoV infection and increase the chances of death. Also, calculating the OR (Table 3) suggested that having Saudi nationality, comorbidity, the interval time of onset sign and admission to the hospital >14 days are other potential risk factors for the disease progression and mortality related to MERS-CoV infection. Although camels are a suspected reservoir, this study could not find a risk relationship in the mortality of patients who had contact with camels in the 14 days prior to clinical signs. Meanwhile, global concern rests on the ability of MERS-CoV to cause major illnesses in direct and indirect contact with camels and its products, namely drinking unpasteurized camel milk (Conzade et al., 2018, Harrath and Abu Duhier, 2018, Kamau et al., 2018). Details as to the specific mechanism of zoonotic transmission from dromedaries to humans remain unclear, and further epidemiological studies are required in this regard. In line with the findings of Alghamdi et al. (Alghamdi et al. 2014), we observed a higher rate of MERS-CoV incidence in males than females (Table 1). However, based on our findings (Table 3) this gender difference in mortality rates related to MERS-CoV was not statistically significant (AOR = 1.24; 95% CI: 0.96\u20131.60), p = 0.098.",

Of the total worldwide cases (2220 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV), only 1408 cases with complete data were investigated in the current study. It should be noted that from 186 MERS-CoV cases in South Korea, only details related to 57 cases were published in the disease outbreak news on the WHO website. The lack of complete data for all MERS cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in the result. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to conduct further large-scale epidemiological studies with complete data related to all morbid cases of MERS to obtain a better understanding of MERS-CoV emergence in humans and also associated risk factors related of this infection. In the future, we may closely monitor the MERS-CoV infections globally to better understand the risks of this new infection for public health and to provide helpful recommendations for controlling and preventing it. Recommendations might change and be updated as additional data becomes available. Indeed, despite the above limitations, such studies might be useful to implement educational programs, and access health care for early diagnosis and prevention of modifiable factors to reduce high mortality rates associated with MERS-CoV.",
