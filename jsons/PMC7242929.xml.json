In order to reserve resources to battle COVID-19, our health system initially limited hospitalizations and inpatient transfers to severe, life-threatening cases or in situations where the need for transplantation was imminent, although within a short period of time reentry strategies that include elective surgeries are being implemented . It is not yet clear how many needed hospitalizations were deferred in the community or what long-term sequelae this may have. We also recognize that patient perceptions alter their willingness to accept routine blood tests and imaging studies that could also negatively impact quality of care. We do not yet have data on those with alcohol use disorders, relapse rates, or attendance in \u201cvirtual rehabilitation\u201d.",

The most valuable lesson is how adaptable we can be in the face of adversity. While we do not believe that the COVID-19 disruption has led to apocalyptic consequences for our local patient population, we also cannot lose sight of the fact that well-resourced transplant and tertiary care centers are better-positioned in these challenging times. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to continue to share detailed and contemporaneous outcome data as it becomes available and disseminate best practices that will last far beyond this crisis.",
