We performed total RNa-seq on viral-infected lungs from eight mouse strains, yielding a large data set of transcriptional responses. Overall 5,329 lncRNas were differentially expressed after infection. Most of the lncRNas were co-expressed with coding genes in modules enriched in genes associated with lung homeostasis pathways or immune response processes. each lncRNa was further individually annotated using a rank-based method, enabling us to associate 5,295 lncRNas to at least one gene set and to predict their potential cis effects. We validated the lncRNas predicted to be interferon-stimulated by profiling mouse responses after interferon-\u03b1 treatment. altogether, these results provide a broad categorization of potential lncRNa functions and identify subsets of lncRNas with likely key roles in respiratory virus pathogenesis.

            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are two respiratory pathogens that belong to independent viral families yet can cause similar acute lung disease. 1 In 2012-2013, the emergence of a novel IAV, the avian H7N9 virus, and of a novel human CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has raised pandemic concerns and highlights the importance of deciphering general mechanisms of respiratory virus pathogenesis. Respiratory virus infection outcome is determined by a complex game between the virus and the host, the rules of which are not fully understood, but where the host-response can be more deleterious than the virus itself for inducing lung disease. 2 Highthroughput methods have been used to globally characterize the host response to IAV and SARS-CoV infections and have revealed that the dynamics and magnitude of the innate immune response to infection, as well as immune cell infiltration, are crucial aspects of pathogenesis. [3] [4] [5] Some potentially important host factors for the antiviral response, whose functions remain largely unexplored, are nonprotein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). There is an increasing number of different classes of these regulatory ncRNAs: small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), promoter-associated small RNA (PASRs), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). lncRNAs are endogenous cellular RNAs that are mRNA-like in length (> 200 nt) but which lack any positive-strand openreading frames longer than 30 amino acids. A recent review estimates the number of total lncRNAs is in the range of ~20,000 transcripts, but only about 200 lncRNAs have been characterized to date. 6 Known lncRNAs are involved in many complex human diseases and regulate key cellular processes by a variety of molecular mechanisms. Among the most well studied lncRNAs, Xist and Air have been shown to epigenetically silence transcription by targeting chromatin-modifying complexes to particular genes in trans and cis, respectively. 7, 8 Other lncRNAs act at the post-transcriptional level, such as H19 lncRNA, which serves as the precursor for miR-675 to moderate cell growth, 9 and Malat1, which forms a molecular scaffold for several proteins present in nuclear speckles and which regulates pre-mRNA alternative splicing. 10 Recently, several studies have identified lncRNAs as major players in the host-response to pathogens. Differential expression of lncRNA is observed in response to viral infection 11 and in immune cells after stimulation or differentiation. 12 In particular, we previously observed that 500 annotated and 1,000 novel lncRNAs are differentially expressed in mice after SARS-CoV infection. 13 About 40% of these changes were similarly observed in mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 and in response to interferon (IFN) treatment. 13 A few lncRNAs have been functionally studied for their role in viral pathogenesis. For example, Tmevpg1 (also known as NeST ), is an antisense transcript distal to IFNG that is involved in Theiler's virus persistence and decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis, and it enhances IFNG gene expression by binding to the histone methyltransferase complex and altering histone 3 methylation at the IFN-\u03b3 locus. 14, 15 Neat1 is one of many lncRNAs induced by HIV-1 infection, and it serves as a scaffold for the nuclear paraspeckle substructure that can sequester some mRNAs in the nucleus. 16 Importantly, Neat1 deficiency enhances HIV-1 replication. 17 Identifying the role of all lncRNAs involved in the hostresponse to infection is especially challenging because of their large number and variety of functions. It has been hypothesized that lncRNAs function through their secondary structure rather than through their primary sequence. 6 However, there are currently no computational methods to reliably predict a single secondary structure for a single sequence of long RNA, 18 which could in turn be used to predict lncRNA function. In addition, minimal lncRNA expression, localization and interactome data are available, which also limits our understanding of lncRNA function. With the large amount of transcriptome data generated by high-throughput technologies, predicting gene function on the basis of expression is an attractive strategy for the characterization of novel or unannotated transcripts. 19 One approach for predicting the function of unknown genes is the 'guilt by association' approach, according to which genes with similar expression profiles are functionally associated. This strategy was successfully applied to 340 mouse lncRNAs after re-annotation of the Affymetrix Mouse Array using 34 data sets derived from diverse mouse tissues. 20 Here, we expanded this approach by using total RNA-Seq to profile pulmonary transcriptomic responses in mice infected with either highly pathogenic IAV or SARS-CoV. Eight mouse strains with large genetic diversity and that constitute the Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains 21 were infected with either mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus or with recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, providing a wide range of host transcriptional responses to two different respiratory viruses. We found that lncRNAs accounted for about 40% of total genes differentially expressed (DE) upon infection. Of these DE lncRNAs, 5,295 were functionally annotated using module-based and rankbased enrichment methods, with universal and ad hoc gene sets. To validate the lncRNAs predicted to be IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the context of respiratory disease, we profiled mouse pulmonary transcriptomic responses after IFN\u03b1 treatment by an independent total RNA-Seq experiment. We anticipate that our lncRNA annotation, entirely available through a user-friendly web interface, MONOCLdb (www.monocldb.org), will accelerate mechanistic characterization of lncRNA function(s) that are of general interest to the infectious disease and immunology fields.",

These eight mouse strains -A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ ShiLtJ, NZO/HILt, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ -represent the founder strains for the CC mouse resource project. 21 They were chosen for the CC resource because of their large genetic diversity and they have also been previously shown to have a wide range of susceptibility to PR8 infection. 22 Weight loss was monitored daily over the course of infection and we found that the CC founders had a wide range of morbidity after either PR8 or MA15 infection (Fig S2A) . We also noted that the strains most susceptible to PR8 infection (C57BL/6J and A/J) were not the most susceptible to infection with MA15. While C57BL/6J and A/J mice lost the most weight at four days post infection [DPI] when infected with PR8, these two strains were regaining weight between three and four DPI when infected with MA15. The two mouse strains most susceptible to MA15 were PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ, but these strains had intermediate to low susceptibility to PR8 infection. In addition to the wide range of weight loss, the CC founders also supported PR8 and MA15 viral replication to different levels (Fig S2B) . Overall, viral replication was not significantly correlated with weight loss after either MA15 or PR8 infection (Fig S2C) . However, when considering samples at four DPI only, there was a significant correlation between weight loss and viral replication (p-value < 0.01), especially after MA15 infection (Fig S2C) .",

After normalization and expression-based filtering, the distribution of log 2 scaled counts showed that the 12,211 lncRNAs that passed our criteria (see Methods) were generally expressed to a lower level than the 15,355 coding genes, with a median of 8.2 and 5.7 counts (in log 2 ) per coding and non-coding genes, respectively (Fig S4) . However, multidimensional scaling (MDS) representation of samples based on lncRNA expression (Fig. 1A) or on coding-gene expression (Fig. 1B) showed that lncRNA expression levels differentiated infection conditions as well as coding gene expression. In addition to clustering by infection condition, samples were clustered based on their genetic background, with three main clusters that were representative of mouse phylogenic origin: M.m. domesticus (WSB/EiJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILt, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ and A/J), M.m. castaneus (CAST/EiJ) and M.m. musculus (PWK/PhJ) (Fig. 1A) . Notably, this clustering was less striking when based on coding-gene expression, with CAST/ EiJ samples being closer to M.m. domesticus samples, indicating that lncRNA basal levels might be more strain specific than coding gene expression (Fig. 1B) . In addition, the dynamic range of lncRNA expression following either MA15 or PR8 infection was as large as the coding gene expression range, though lncRNA expression levels were more downregulated while coding gene expression levels were more upregulated after infection (Fig. 1C) . Finally, we found a large number of genes were DE after either MA15 or PR8 infection, with differences in the magnitude of response that depended on the mouse strain and virus (Fig. 1D) Notably, DE lncRNA were as strongly correlated with viral replication and morbidity as DE coding genes (Fig S5) . Many DE coding and non-coding genes were highly correlated with viral replication, while the association with mouse weight loss was weaker. However, 62% of DE lncRNAs were negatively correlated with viral replication while only 42% of coding genes were positively correlated with viral replication (Fig S5) , which was consistent with DE lncRNAs being more downregulated after infection compared with the coding genes. Altogether, these results show that while lncRNAs were on average slightly less expressed than the coding genes, their differential expression and dynamic range after infection and association with viral replication was just as strong.",

            "text": "DE lncRNAs are tightly co-expressed with DE coding genes Genes sharing similar functions tend to be co-expressed. 20 To computationally characterize functions of DE lncRNAs, we determined whether they were co-expressed with DE genes of known functions. We first evaluated several parametric and nonparametric methods, including Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, maximal information coefficient (MIC), Hoeffding, distance correlation (dcor) and biweight midcorrelation (bicor) to determine the optimal method for detecting co-expressed coding genes sharing similar function (Supplemental Materials and Fig S6) . The signed bicor metric outperformed other methods, especially for associating coding genes belonging to similar reactome pathways (Fig S6) . We then computed pairwise correlation between DE genes using the signed bicor. We compared the distribution of bicor coefficient between pairs of lncRNAs or pairs of coding genes, or mixed pairs of coding and non-coding genes ( Fig  S7) . The median bicor coefficient was similar between pairs of lncRNAs and coding genes, and coding genes were more likely to be strongly correlated together than were pairs of lncRNAs. On the other hand, a higher number of mixed pairs of coding and non-coding genes were highly negatively correlated than \"pure\" pairs of coding genes or of lncRNAs (Fig S7) , consistent with their different trend of regulation after infection. Based on these pairwise correlations, a complete weighted network was inferred and 11 modules comprised of tightly co-expressed coding and non-coding genes were detected. These modules were classified arbitrarily by color names. Figure 2A shows that within each . each RNa sample is represented as a single point colored by viral treatment (green for mock-, salmon for Ma15-and blue for PR8-infected samples), and with a different shape according to mouse strain. convex hulls link samples belonging to the same condition, with different line width depicting the DPI. euclidian distance was calculated using the normalized counts data for lncRNa passing Qc (A) or coding genes passing Qc (B), such that proximity indicates similarity, while distance indicates dissimilarity of gene-expression profiles. Kruskal's stress (Ks) quantifies the quality of the representations as a fraction of the information lost during the dimensionality reduction procedure. (C) Dynamic range of expression after infection for lncRNa compared with coding genes. Boxplots represent the 5% and 95% quantile (lower and upper extreme whiskers), 25% and 75% (lower and upper hinges) and the median of gene expression changes after infection in log 2 Fc, considering data for two and four DPI and for all eight mice strains together. (D) Number of differentially expressed (DE) lncRNa and coding genes after infection at each DPI and for each mouse strain (FDR = 1%). Dark colors represent lncRNas and the light colors represent coding genes. module, gene expression levels changed very similarly after infection. Whereas the brown and salmon modules included 95% of coding genes or 94% of lncRNAs (respectively), the other modules included both coding genes and lncRNAs that were strongly co-expressed (Fig. 2B) .",

The rationale for using Immgen and GeneAtlas gene-sets is that immune cells infiltrating the lungs contribute to respiratory virus pathogenesis and account for a large part of the pulmonary transcriptomic response observed after infection. 3 Therefore, we specifically determined whether co-expressed genes in immune cells (Immgen) or genes predominantly expressed in immune cells compared with lung epithelial cells (GeneAtlas) were enriched in each module. In addition, modules were also correlated with weight loss data and viral replication to determine their relevance during infection ( Table 1) . Enrichment for each module is described in Suppl Text. Some modules had specific expression patterns, depending on the mouse strain and infecting virus. For example, the green module, which was enriched in cytoskeleton and epithelial cilium functions, was specifically correlated with PR8 viral replication and was downregulated after PR8 infection in all founders except for NZO/HILt mice, which were resistant to PR8 infection (Fig S8) . The turquoise module was the largest upregulated module, with 1,331 lncRNAs and 1,664 coding genes highly upregulated to different extents in all eight founders infected with either PR8 or MA15 ( Fig. 2A-B) . This module was highly enriched in ISGs and inflammatory/IFN related pathways, and enriched in genes with promoters containing the ISGF3 binding motif. The turquoise module was also the most highly correlated module with viral replication following either MA15 or PR8 infection.",

This also provided a primary level of annotation for lncRNAs belonging to each module. Moreover, an advantage of module definition was that we were able to determine which lncRNAs were highly connected in each module (intra-modular hubs) and which might regulate the module. Considering the whole network, we found that coding genes were more likely to be key points (hubs or bottlenecks) of the network than were lncRNAs (Fig. 2C) . However, considering centrality within each module, we found that some lncRNAs were among the top intramodular hubs. For example, n280959, n266006 and n265692 were the most highly connected lncRNAs within the turquoise module (hub percentile ranks > 98%) and may have key roles in regulating the IFN response against viral infection (Fig. 2D) .

There was good agreement between the two methods, with lncRNAs mostly associated with ISGs belonging to the turquoise module ( Fig. 5A and B) . To validate our functional predictions, we performed an independent experiment by treating C57BL/6J mice with IFN-\u03b1. Whole transcriptome pulmonary responses were determined at 12 h post-treatment by total RNA-Seq and statistical analysis was performed to identify DE coding and non-coding genes in IFN-\u03b1 treated mice compared with mock treated mice. We did not observe any immune cell infiltration by hematoxylin and eosin staining at this time point (data not shown) and significantly induced genes were consequently defined as ISGs. In our experimental conditions at 12 h post-treatment, we found only 240 significantly upregulated genes after IFN treatment, including 187 coding genes and 53 lncRNAs. lncRNAs that were upregulated after IFN treatment, depicted in black in Figure 5C , were significantly enriched in the top of the list of predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs. Other predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs that were not found DE in the lungs of IFN-treated C57BL/6J mice were mostly upregulated but did not pass the statistical threshold (Fig. 5D) . It is possible that these lncRNAs would be more upregulated following IFN treatment of other CC founder strains. Finally, the top predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs (i.e., lncRNA with lowest p-values of enrichment in ISG = in the lowest PR for enrichment in ISG) were the most significantly highly induced after IFN treatment (Fig. 5D) . This indicates that p-values of enrichment (or PR) were predictive of function and that a higher confidence in functional annotation should be placed in enrichment within lower PR.",

Using a 'guilt-by-association' approach to annotation, 5,295 lncRNAs were characterized by at least one gene set. This greatly expands the work of Liao et al., who used similar methods to characterize the lncRNAs present on the Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array and to annotate 340 mouse lncRNAs based on their expression in 34 data sets. 20 While Liao et al. included diverse tissues and biological conditions, they did not include viral infection and had only one data set derived from a bacterial infection (Aeromonas spp. infected intestinal cells). In the present study, we focused on characterizing lncRNAs that were involved in respiratory virus pathogenesis. In terms of methodology, we used both a module-based and a rank-based annotation. However, whereas Liao et al. only considered the top 0.05 percentile first degree of each lncRNA for their \"hub-based method,\" we did not threshold the correlated genes but rather used the whole weighted network by performing a ranked functional enrichment for each lncRNA. We found that thresholding the first degree of each lncRNA gave enrichment results that were highly dependent on the cutoff used, and consequently we chose a method that was independent of any threshold and which was more robust.",

We observed that the eight CC founder mice had a large range of phenotypic response to infection, associated with a large difference in the magnitude of the transcriptomic response. We have previously shown that NZO/HILt and PWK/PhJ resistance to PR8 infection was due to the dominant gene Mx1, that acts in the context of IAV infection but not SARS-CoV infection. 22 The present study sheds light on other genes that may be involved in IAV and SARS-CoV susceptibility. Specifically, 34 of 210 lncRNAs that were found in regions controlling SARS-CoV [Gralinski et al., in preparation] , and 53 of 296 lncRNAs in regions controlling IAV resistance, 22 were DE. None of these lncRNAs has been previously functionally described. Among this very rich list, an interesting lncRNA to further explore is n268833 (AK142945), which belongs to the QTL HrI2 (Host response to Influenza). 22 This lncNRA was significantly upregulated after PR8 infection in all CC mice except CAST/EiJ, NZO/ HILt and PWK/PhJ, which were the three strains the most resistant to PR8 infection. The expression of n268833 was highly correlated with PR8 replication, belonged to the turquoise module, and was strongly positively correlated with IL-18. Among the list of DE lncRNAs present in QTL controlling SARS-CoV resistance, n276032 (AK047596 ), n290720 (AK017435) and n292484 (AK132900) were specifically upregulated in CAST/ EiJ mice infected by MA15, which had the highest viral replication and the most weight loss. n276032 is in the QTL associated with SARS-CoV titer [Gralinski et al., in preparation] , was annotated in the turquoise module and was enriched in innate immune pathways by the rank-based method. These results suggest that some lncRNAs might control mouse genetic susceptibility to respiratory viruses, and highlight the richness of this data set to mine from different angles to further hypothesis generation and an understanding of respiratory virus pathogenesis and lncRNA functions.",

We provide the scientific community with a database (MONOCLdb) to easily retrieve expression values and annotation of any given lncRNA. In addition, we generated a large RNA-Seq data set, with gene-expression profiles from 120 CC founder mice. This represents a valuable resource for mouse genomic studies and for the Collaborative Cross. We expect that this work will help to design the experimental characterization of important lncRNAs and will accelerate general knowledge about lncRNA functions. In particular, mechanistic characterization of lncRNAs predicted to belong to the IFN response would have a broad impact for immunology and infectious disease fields.",

Remaining reads were mapped against specific CC founder strain transcriptomes with SOAPaligner/soap2. 38 For each read, a maximum number of two mismatches were allowed, and repeat hits were kept. The insert window for paired-end reads was set between 20 and 500 nt. To determine fragment count on the gene level from the SOAP output, we used a custom script in Java reproducing HTSeq paired and strand-specific union mode. 39 Out of 44,360 genes common in all CC founder transcriptomes, 40,566 genes, including 19,838 coding and 20,728 non-coding genes, were quantified with at least one read count across the experiment. Data normalization and differential expression analysis Technical replicates were in strong agreement with each other (Pearson correlation coefficient of their log 2 raw gene counts r 2 > 0.9) and they were summed as recommended in the DESeq package. 39 Three samples were further excluded based on their low raw gene counts distribution (GEO accession numbers: GSM1265573, GSM1265541, GSM1265528). This resulted in a total of 120 samples that were used for subsequent analysis (Table S3 ). We filtered out the genes that were not consistently expressed by keeping only genes that had at least 10 raw read counts in 75% of the samples of a single biological condition, defined based on mouse strain and viral infection condition. 40 The expression-based filtering resulted in 15,355 coding-genes and 12,211 non-coding genes that passed inspection. Data normalization was performed using a scaling method, as implemented in the DESeq bioconductor package. 39 Individual Log 2 fold change (FC) were calculated after offsetting the normalized data by 1 and by subtracting individual log 2 values by the mean of log 2 expression values from mouse strain-matched mock samples. To determine differentially expressed (DE) genes in response to infection, samples from each mouse strain infected with MA15 or PR8 at each DPI were compared with the pool of strain-matched mock-infected mice. Differential expression was assessed using the negative binomial model implemented in DESeq, 39 with genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 1% defined as DE.

In addition, genes highly expressed in immune cells compared with lung were defined as genes expressed 20-fold more in each immune cell subset than in lung based on microarray analysis from GeneAtlas V3 (GSE10246) and that were expressed only in that cell subset. IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were defined as the union of genes significantly upregulated 12 and 24 h after treatment of BALB/c mice with IFN-\u03b1 46 and genes significantly upregulated in at least one of the eight CC founder-strain-derived MEF cells treated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 (Log 2 FC > 2 and adjusted Student's p-value < 0.01). For transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, we scanned promoters (defined as \u2212450 to +50 nt from cDNA start using GRCm38.70 sequences) for the presence of mouse TF motifs contained in the JASPAR CORE 47 and UniPROBE 48 databases using FIMO software 49 from the MEME suite. 50 The presence of a motif in each gene promoter was defined as having a p-value < 10^-4. Finally, the last category of gene-sets was genes present in QTL regions determining PR8 22 or MA15 responses [Gralinski et al., in preparation].",

Modules were given color names arbitrarily and genes that did not belong to any module were assigned the color grey. Association between each module and phenotypic data (weight loss and viral replication) was calculated by computing the biweight midcorrelation between phenotypic data and each module representative expression profile (\"module eigengene\") using the WGCNA package. In addition, each module was characterized functionally by calculating enrichment scores in each of the gene-sets described above as -log 10 (p-value) determined by one-sided Fisher's exact test with background set as all genes passing our expression-based filtering.",

We used the up distinctdirectional p-value, which assesses whether genes belonging to a given gene-set are significantly enriched in the top of the ranked list (i.e., highly positively correlated with the lncRNA). We chose to consider only positively correlated genes (and not both highly positively and negatively correlated genes) because we found that positive signed correlation outperformed unsigned correlation to associate genes with similar functions (Fig S6) . Adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered as significant. For each gene-set, we further determined which lncRNA were the most associated with the gene-set by computing the percentile ranked (PR) on significant p-values.",

Neighbor genes were defined as genes within 200 kb from the middle of the lncRNA gene, using Grm38.70 coordinates. The middle of each gene was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the middle of its transcripts (defined as the difference between stop and start coordinates). A given lncRNA was defined as cis enhancer-like if it was found significantly positively correlated with all its coding neighbors, regardless of the chromosomal strand, or only considering neighbors on the same strand (sense) or on the opposite strand (antisense). Inversely, a given lncRNA was defined as a potential cis inhibitor if it was found significantly negatively correlated with all its coding neighbors. Significance of biweight midcorrelation was defined as two sided Student p-value < 0.01. lncRNAs with no significantly correlated neighboring gene or with both positively and negatively correlated neighbors were classified as potential trans lncRNAs. Specificity of potential cis lncRNA effect on coding neighbors was computed using PAGE analysis 51 for cis lncRNA with more than two coding neighbors. Up distinct-directional p-values were used for enhancer-like cis lncRNA to assess specific positive correlation with coding genes, and down distinct-directional p-values were used for inhibitor cis lncRNA to assess specific negative correlation with coding genes.",
