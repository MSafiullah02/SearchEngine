The patient entered the operating room with a surgical mask, whereas all the operators were wearing a FFP3 Q6 mask along with facial shield, a sterile surgical gown, leg covers, and 2 pairs of surgical gloves per World Health Organization protocol (3). The procedure of wearing and removing these devices was proposed by the European Center of Disease Protection and Control (4). At the end of the procedure, all the used disposable material was treated separately to avoid any possible contamination. SUBSEQUENT HOSPITAL CARE AND FOLLOW-UP During the post-operative stay, the patient had no other episodes of chest pain, and his vital parameters remained stable. The patient had another echocardiogram that demonstrated that his ejection fraction increased to 55% and regional wall motion abnormalities resolved (Videos 5 and 6). Given the previous treatment with aspirin 100 mg daily, at the time of the procedure, 2 crushed 90-mg pills (180 mg) of ticagrelor (5,6) were administered to put the patient in dual antiplatelet therapy. Regarding COVID-19, despite the continuous high fever and dry cough, the patient's respiratory parameters remained stable. .5 g every 8 h to avoid possible bacterial superinfections. Up to now, the patient has shown an improvement of his clinical conditions with no more need for oxygen supplementation.

In the next days, due to the recurrence of chest pain and hyperthermia, accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and mild hypoxia, we decided to have a second, urgent heart team discussion after the evaluation by the infectious disease specialist and the intensivist. Based on the hypothesis that the patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further, it was decided to treat the coronary disease percutaneously to avoid surgical-related morbidity, going beyond current practice guidelines (1).In the light of the complex coronary artery disease,given the left ventricular dysfunction and the intention to perform LMCA stenting with a double-stent bifurcation technique in the presence of a chronic total occlusion of the right coronary artery, it was given indication to use a temporary left ventricular support device: the Impella CP system (Abiomed, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts). (Disclaimer: The use of Impella described in this case is not currently approved in the United States.) The LMCA was treated using the double kissingcrush technique, with excellent angiographic result confirmed by intravascular ultrasounds",
