On February 20, new outbreaks were detected in Codogno, Lodi province, Lombardy region, in terms of 16 infected people, summing up to 60 on the following day and causing the first deaths soon after [5] [6] [7] [8] . The patient identified as Case 1 was a 38-year old man from Codogno having respiratory tract infection signs. His wife and a close friend were also found COVID-19positive [5] so that 13 municipalities in Lombardy and one in Veneto were immediately isolated to fulfil contagion containment procedures [9] . Figures 1 to 3 depict the evolution pattern of the epidemic in Italy throughout April 18, 2020 showing some slight positive signal, despite an overall long-lasting trend. When referring to the initial cases recorded in Lazio and in Lombardy, the epidemic has consistently followed parallel trends in the North (quite turbulent) and in the Center-South of Italy (much slower) and now, when freezing the official picture derived from data of the Ministry of Health processed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS) as of April 18, 2020 (Table 1) , we detect a huge difference between the two regions. Demographic data is quite different and strongly in favor of Lombardy in terms of number of provinces, municipalities, inhabitants, geographical surface and population density (people/km 2 ) [12]. In greater detail, when looking at results from the two regional capitals, accounting per se for the highest population density and consequently most relevant contagion spread risk, a paradox becomes immediately apparent: despite having fewer inhabitants than Rome (1,352,000 versus 2,873,000), Milan has suffered from a five-fold infection rate so far.",

            "text": "Despite discrepancies in timing, modality and rule severity, China and Italy adopted similar containment procedures, yet the spread of contagion was much faster in Northern than in Southern Italy (almost invariably comparable to Lazio). It is quite evident from Wuhan experience that the stricter the isolation rules for assessed or potentially infected people, the easier it is to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading. This was the case in Rome where, immediately after being diagnosed, the two Chinese infected persons were admitted into the Spallanzani Hospital, a 40-year-renowned research and care center for infectious diseases and all their travel-mates and contacts were identified and isolated into the Cecchignola military citadel on the outskirts of Rome. All over Lombardy, instead, due to the lack of symptoms of infected people for several days or even weeks, virus spread was much wider, thus reaching out to Veneto and Emilia-Romagna regions, and presumably required longer to develop earlier symptoms after being infected. This might be explained by the fact that the two Chinese cases in Rome were older than Case 1 in Codogno (i.e. 68 vs 38 years of age). The former followed an easily traceable tourist itinerary while the latter moved around quite easily and extensively among regions making it impossible to track down all contacts. Moreover, the evidence so far seems to indicate that, besides being burdened by higher mortality due to the frequent coexistence of other diseases, older subjects are more easily infected and severely ill and this might have caused weakness symptoms quite soon preventing the Chinese patients in Rome from moving around [13, 14] . There are also anecdotical reports concerning a shorter incubation period in the elderly which might add to the above, yet further studies are still needed to validate such hypothesis.",

            "text": "Are there any other possible explanations for accelerated coronavirus spread in Lombardy? Indeed, the most affected area in the region, including Milan and its hinterland, is quite rich in farms and industries asking for intensive daily commuting and in the early phases of the epidemic most activities were still in place and partially stopped only about two weeks later. In fact, beginning of March, after the outbreak had already shown its threatening potential, only \"crucial\" activities were allowed to go on including food and drug chains, logistic support providers, general practitioner (GP) offices, which anyway involved some 40% of the working population [14] . So considerable train, metro and bus commuting, relatively late recognition and multiple outbreak sites might have favored such a large infection spreading pattern in Northern Italy. Two more observations might also be taken into account, albeit requiring further validation by controlled studies: (i) a large number of treatment-resistant pneumonia events occurring already in January were reported by GPs a posteriori, i.e. after SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and might reflect the presence in the area of potentially unrecognized carriers responsible for the exponential spreading of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 Infection in individuals with DM is expected to trigger higher stress conditions, with greater release of hyperglycemic hormones, e.g., glucocorticoids and catecholamines, leading to increased blood glucose levels and abnormal glucose variability (26) . On the other hand, according to a retrospective study from Wuhan some 10% COVID-19-positive patients with T2DM suffered at least one hypoglycemic event (<3.9 mmol/L) (27) . Notoriously, hypoglycemia mobilizes pro-inflammatory monocytes and increases platelet reactivity, thus contributing to a higher cardiovascular mortality in patients with DM (28] .",

In animal models, structural lung changes have been related to diabetes, such as augmented vasculature permeability and collapsed alveolar epithelium [35] . Finally, abnormal delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and complement activation dysfunction [36] have been reported in patients with DM. All of the above suggests that the greatest possible attention should be paid to the high risk for more severe lung involvement pending on people with DM during COVID-19 infection, due to a significantly lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in the presence of raised glucose levels [37] .",

At this point we also feel like underlining that some hypoglycemic treatment strategies might turn out to be protective. Dipeptidyl-dipeptidase-4 (DPP-4) was shown, in fact, to be the primary receptor of MERS-CoV [37] : the possibility that DPP-4 also acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 warrants investigation and, should this be the case, in agreement with the hypothesis put forward by Iacobellis [38] , DPP-4 inhibitors, well-renowned treatment tools in T2DM, should be explored for their anti-viral potential in the human [15] . Opposite to that, it has been recently hypothesized that Sodium-Glucose-Transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), Pioglitazone and even Insulin might induce an over-expression of the ACE2 receptor which was also found to bind to coronaviruses in the alveoli [39] , and therefore increase the risk for a more severe expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with diabetes [40] .",

Acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are partly due to the host immune response and corticosteroids were broadly used in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [42, 43] due to their ability to suppress histologically proven virus-dependent lung inflammation with diffuse alveolar damage [44] . However, they also inhibit immunity and pathogen clearance and, in the face of very little benefit if so ever, have been associated with delayed viral RNA clearance or increased mortality and rate of complications, including diabetes, psychosis, and avascular necrosis [42] . Due to all the above, the interim guidance from the WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection advises against the use of corticosteroids upon suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside clinical trials [45] , yet corticosteroids were extensively utilized before that in at least 34% of the large number of Northern Italian hospitalized patients [46] . At analysing the growth curve of coronavirus infection in Italy, the massive referral to the hospitals of so many people within a very a short period strikes the eye when compared to the small number of hospitalized patients in the South (Figura 4) . In the stormy and overcrowded emergency conditions faced by health professionals at the start of the epidemic in the absence of any experience with treating COVID-19 disease, a broader recourse to high doses of corticosteroids most likely occurred than later on, when in fact better treatment strategies were identified and emergency departments were less congested. It can be assumed that the above mentioned logistic and environmental factors strongly affected clinical course and mortality rates of COVID-infected people and even more in those with DM. Indeed, Fig. 4 clearly shows that death rate was significantly higher in infected Northern",

The latter, however, display a slightly higher phenolic acid and lignan intake due to a higher consumption of cereals and legumes and a slightly lower total polyphenol intake as flavonoids and stilbenes due to lower wine consumption [49] . This takes on a particular significance when comparing the absolute and relative death rate of subjects with T2DM in Lombardy (11,384 deaths; 56.9% of infected individuals) to that observed in Lazio (259 deaths; 1.3% of infected individuals).
