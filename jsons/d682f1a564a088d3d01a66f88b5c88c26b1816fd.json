Since then, the number of reported cases has increased rapidly, with more than 51,800 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1600 deaths as of Feb. 16, 2020. In addition to China, cases have spread to 25 other countries ( Figure 1 ) including 15 cases in the United States. Initial outbreak data from China show a near exponential growth of reported cases. 5 Reported numbers are likely underestimates of the true numbers because milder cases are less likely to be reported.",

The term coronavirus derives from the Latin word corona, which means crown or halo; that designation arises from the appearance of coronavirus virions viewed by electron microscopy, in which the virus particles display a crown-like fringe typically referred to as spikes ( Figure 3 ).",

Fecal-oral transmission and transmission via fomites have also been reported. 8 Airborne spread because of inhalation of small particle aerosols may also be possible. Transmission in health care settings  was frequently seen during the 2003  outbreak, with superspreading (when a  single patient transmits infection to a  disproportionate number of contacts) reported. 9 The incubation period was estimated at a mean of 4.6 days, with a range of 2e14 days.

However, since 2016, the number of cases of MERS-CoV has been dramatically reduced after public health efforts to prevent MERS-CoV transmission were put into place. 24 Information on MERS among pregnant women is limited. We identified reports of 13 cases of pregnant women with MERS from several countries, including Saudi Arabia (n \u00bc 8), Korea (n \u00bc 2), Jordan (n \u00bc 1), United Arab Emirates (n \u00bc 1), and Philippines (n \u00bc 1). 13,25e31 Two women were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation. Among the 11 symptomatic women, manifestations were similar to those seen in nonpregnant patients with MERS. Timeline showing key events in the COVID-19 outbreak Expert Review ajog.org Seven of 13 patients were admitted to an intensive care unit for respiratory deterioration or acute respiratory distress syndrome, 5 required ventilator support, 3 died, and 8 recovered. Among the 3 deaths, the mothers died 8e25 days after delivery. Both babies born to asymptomatic women were born healthy at term; among those who were symptomatic, there was 1 intrauterine fetal demise, 1 stillbirth, 1 baby delivered at 25 weeks who died 4 hours after birth, 2 healthy preterm infants, and 5 healthy term infants (infant status was not mentioned for 1). Early data suggested an association between the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and COVID-19 with 27 of 41 cases in 1 report 32 and 26 of 47 in another report 33 with epidemiologic links to the market, leading to closure of the market on Jan. 1, 2020. Given that the earliest case reported (illness onset on Dec. 1, 2019) 32 did not have exposure to the market raises the possibility that the initial emergence into humans occurred elsewhere. However, sampling of the market's environment supports the market's importance in early transmission of the virus. Later cases were much less likely to have visited the market, supporting the role of personto-person transmission in later cases.",

As with all decisions regarding treatment during pregnancy, carefully weighing of the benefits of interventions for the mother and fetus with potential risks is necessary. As surveillance systems 32, 33, 36, 37 This observed gender difference could be due to differences in reporting, susceptibility, exposure, or recognition and diagnosis of infection.

Previous data on SARS and MERS suggest that clinical findings during pregnancy can range from no symptoms to severe disease and death. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough, with more than 80% of hospitalized patients presenting with these symptoms. 36 In a recent study by Chen et al, 44 9 women diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy were reported.

Based on experience with SARS and MERS, severe respiratory failure might occur in BOX 2 Principles for management of pregnant women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 48,53,54,a Patients with respiratory symptoms should adhere to respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene. Ensure rapid triage of pregnant patients with respiratory symptoms. Patients with respiratory symptoms should wear a facemask and wait in a separate, wellventilated waiting area at least 6 feet from other people. Confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 should be isolated as soon as possible in an AIIR. If an AIIR is not available, consider transfer to a hospital with an AIIR. Implement CDC infection prevention and control procedures for health care providers including standard, contact, and airborne precautions. Eye protection and properly fitted N95 respirators should be used. Provide additional staff training in correct use of personal protective equipment including correct donning, doffing, and disposal of personal protective equipment. Contact hospital infection personnel. In coordination with local/state health department, collect and send relevant specimens for diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing. Limit visitor and health care personnel access to patient rooms with a confirmed or suspected case. Pregnancy should be considered a potentially increased risk condition and monitored closely including fetal heart rate and contraction monitoring. Consider early oxygen therapy (target O 2 saturations 95% and/or pO 2 70 mm Hg). Consider early mechanical ventilation with evidence of advancing respiratory failure. Noninvasive ventilation techniques may have a small increased risk of aspiration in pregnancy. Use intravenous fluids conservatively unless cardiovascular instability is present. Screen for other viral respiratory infections and bacterial infections (because of risk of coinfections). Consider empiric antimicrobial therapy (because of risk for superimposed bacterial infections). Consider empiric treatment for influenza, pending diagnostic testing. Do not routinely use corticosteroids. Use of steroids to promote fetal maturity with anticipated preterm delivery can be considered on individual basis. If septic shock is suspected, institute prompt, targeted management. Delivery and pregnancy termination decisions should be based on gestational age, maternal condition, and fetal stability, and maternal wishes. Consult with specialists in obstetrics, maternal-fetal medicine, neonatology, intensive care, anesthesia, and nursing. Communicate with patients and families regarding diagnosis, clinical status, and management wishes. ajog.org Expert Review pregnant women, and in the most severe cases, mechanical ventilation might not be sufficient to support adequate oxygenation. If that occurs, limited literature suggests a potential role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pregnancy; use should be considered only in centers that have experience with this technique. 47 Whether delivery provides benefit to a critically ill mother is unknown; decisions regarding delivery should consider the gestational age of the fetus and should be made in conjunction with the neonatologist. 48 There are currently no antiviral medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of COVID-19, although broad-spectrum antivirals used in animal models of MERS are being evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2. 46 Corticosteroids for the treatment of coronavirusassociated pneumonia should be avoided unless other indications are present because they were not shown to be beneficial in MERS and could lead to delayed MERS-CoV clearance. 49 Therefore, decisions about the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity should be made in consultation with infectious disease specialists and maternal-fetal medicine consultants. All guidance should be considered subject to revision as additional data on pregnant women with COVID-19 become available.",
