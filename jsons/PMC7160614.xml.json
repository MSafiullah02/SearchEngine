The latest research studies described the characteristic imaging manifestations of COVID-19, including ground-glass opacities (GGO) (57 to 88%), bilateral involvement (76 to 88%), and peripheral distribution (33 to 85%) [7\u201310]. Other imaging features such as consolidation, cavitation, and interlobular septal thickening are also reported in some patients [11\u201313]. However, these imaging manifestations of COVID-19 are nonspecific and are difficult to distinguish from other pneumonia. To our knowledge, there have been no studies explicitly comparing imaging and clinical characteristics between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19.",

However, false-negative results caused by unstable specimen processing are relatively high in clinical practice, which has worsened the spread of the outbreak [15\u201318]. Moreover, laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 requires a rigorous platform, which is not assembled in all hospitals. Thus, this requires specimen transfer, which may delay diagnosis for days. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial, particularly for critically ill patients who need emergency surgery, and with pneumonia complications. To solve these problems, we hypothesize that a diagnostic model can be developed based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, independent of the nucleic acid test.",

The features with p value smaller than 0.05 in univariate analysis were also selected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method [23] was utilized to select the most useful features with penalty parameter tuning that was conducted by 10-fold cross-validation based on minimum criteria.

The classification performances of the models were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were also calculated. A decision curve analysis was conducted to determine the clinical usefulness of the diagnostic model by quantifying the net benefits at different threshold probabilities in the validation dataset [24]. The development of decision curve was described in the Supplementary Materials. Figure 2 depicts the flowchart of the proposed analysis pipeline described above. We also built a nomogram, which was a quantitative tool to predict the individual probability of infection by COVID-19, based on the multivariate logistic analysis of the CR model with the primary cohort. Depending on the coefficient of the predictive factors in multivariate logistic regression model, all values of each predictive factor were assigned points. A total point was obtained by summing all the points of each predictive factor. The scale also showed the relationship between the total point and the prediction probability in the nomogram. The corresponding calibration curves of the CR model in the primary cohort and validation cohort are shown in the Supplementary Material (Fig. E3).",

However, when we subdivided the GGO into pure GGO and mixed GGO, we found that the distribution pattern is different between these two lesions. Pure GGO show differences between groups in every location of the lungs, whereas mixed GGO only have significant differences between groups in the lung periphery. Recent studies defined four stages of lung involvement in COVID-19 [26]. Therefore, a follow-up analysis of these distributions would be significant. The lesion size in patients with COVID-19 infection was another interesting observation. Most lesions were between 1 and 3 cm, with few lesions larger than half of the lung segment, which was similar to the finding in MERS_CoV [22]. Other features similar to MERS_CoV and SARS_CoV were observed in the laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia, which may be associated with the cellular immune deficiency [3, 27].

This result was in accordance with that in previous study in breast cancer, in which the model based on the combination of radiomics features and clinical features achieved a higher performance [24]. Compared with the radiomics-based model, the extraction of radiological semantic features can overcome the image discrepancy caused by different scanning parameters and/or different CT vendors.

Third, longitudinal CT study was not performed. Whether or not this model can be used to evaluate the follow-ups and help to guide therapy remains an open question to be further explored. Moreover, the rich high-order features of the CT image combined with radiomics or deep learning have not been studied, which may be another way to identify the patients with COVID-19.
