Recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among patients with COVID-19, which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 comorbidities to the novel coronavirus, as well as the role of hypertension and CVD in progression and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19. The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting. Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients. Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself. The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.",

ACE2 is a master regulator of RAAS, and both reduced or increased function of ACE2 can induce systemic and pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and diabetic cardiovascular complications [30] . ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, lungs, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, and it plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways. The binding affinity of the novel coronavirus with ACE2 appears to be stronger than the virus that causes SARS, which may explain the significantly higher global influence of COVID-19 than the initial SARS. Potential therapeutic strategies may include preventing the binding of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2.",

The large confusion and panic regarding usage of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) erupted for two reasons: (i) confusion between ACE and ACE2 inhibitors, and (ii) some studies reported a significantly higher percentage of RAAS inhibitors usage among COVID-19 patients with the lethal outcome. ACE and ACE2 are two different enzymes with two different active sites and any effect of ACEI on ACE2 activity must, therefore, be an indirect one, through their corresponding substrates. SARS-CoV-2 binding is unlikely to have any relationship with ACE or ACEI. Nevertheless, there are limited data that ACEIs affect the expression of ACE2 in the heart and the kidney [34] . On the other hand, there is more evidence that ARBs modify ACE2 expression [35, 36] . Upregulation has been primarily found in the cardiac tissue and in the renal vasculature. However, the results are inconsistent, require high ARBs dosages and vary according to ARB and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the organ. Additionally, most investigations measured blood ACE2 activity that reveals the soluble ACE2 protein circulating at very low levels, which is not the same as membrane-bound ACE2. If ARBs upregulated membrane-bound ACE2, it is reasonable to hypothesize that this would be the consequence of AT1 receptor blockade. ACEIs would have a similar effect as ARBs, even though there are only limited data about ACEI-induced upregulation of ACE2. However, the currently available data are mostly obtained in animal studies and could not be directly applied to humans. Therefore, there is no sufficient evidence that ARBs or ACEIs could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and cause COVID-19.",

Moreover, ACEI or ARB treatment increased the level of CD3 and CD8 T cell in peripheral blood and reduced the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs. These findings were the first evidence which supports the benefit of ACEIs or ARBs in COVID-19 patients with hypertension because they can potentially improve clinical outcomes in these patients. The authors hypothesized that RAAS inhibitors did not directly inhibit the viral replication, but had an indirect antiviral role by regulation of the immune function and inhibition of the inflammatory response. Nevertheless, the potential mechanisms need to be clarified in the future large human studies. A large study that included 1,128 hypertensive patients with COVID-19 showed that inpatient use of ACEI/ARB, after adjustment for age, gender and comorbidities, was related with lower all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users [42] . Further analysis revealed that the use of RAAS inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension in comparison to the use of other antihypertensive drugs [42] . itself. This is why several specialty societies recommended that COVID-19 patients continue therapy with RAAS inhibitors [43] [44] [45] [46] .

One of the most important limitations is the self-reporting of comorbidities on hospital admission, which can cause significant underestimation of comorbidities because of the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing. The follow-up period was short and some patients remained in hospital when the data were being analyzed, meaning that the actual outcome is unknown, which can interfere with the published results. Obesity was not reported in any of these studies and the influence of BMI could not be investigated or included in the adjustment, which would be of great importance.",
