However, Case 3 with a normal lymphocyte count and CRP survived. These cases raise the possibility that performing elective operative interventions on patients with undetected hidden or mild form of COVID-19 may lead to contamination of operative room and equipment, with risk of transmission of the infection to operative team and other healthcare providers in hospitals. Secondary transmission of COVID-19 in the hospital setting in not uncommon [3]. Case 3, who developed fever on postoperative day 2, probably had hidden or mild form of disease at the time of surgery with a real risk of spreading to others during hospital admission. It is not clear if Case 1 and Case 2, who were readmitted about 2 weeks after surgery, got the infection at the time of surgery or after hospital discharge in community. Obviously if Case 4 was not presenting with pulmonary manifestations (e.g. if he was only in the incubation period of infection with minimal symptoms), he would have had the bariatric procedure the next day. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the perioperative course with diagnostic challenge and a high potential fatality rate. Depending on the severity of an epidemic and availability of resources, the risk and benefits of performing elective surgical procedures should be carefully assessed in this setting. In locations with widespread infections and limited resources, the risk of elective surgical procedures for index patient and community may outweigh the benefit. In some situations, postponing elective surgical procedures might be the right decision which can also preserve the resources including the personal protective equipment and maintain treatment space for critical patients. Another option would be routine or selective screening of patients for Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Utilizing telemedicine and virtual visits using a smartphone for perioperative visits can also be an option to decrease the risk of spreading the infection during the outbreaks. Although many questions remain unanswered about COVID-19 and surgical practice, the surgical and perioperative communities should appropriately respond to this worldwide public health crisis to improve patient outcomes and minimize the burden on the health care systems and Dr Razeghian-Jahromi had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data.Concept and design: All authors Acquisition and interpretation of data: Safari, Razeghian-Jahromi, Ghorbani Drafting of the manuscript: Aminian Critical revision of the manuscript: All authors Conflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.
