They are zoonotic enveloped RNA respiratory viruses that rarely transmit between humans in their native form, but could mutate to allow more efficient human-to-human transmission. This was illustrated by the 2002\u20132003 SARS pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.3, 4 Frequent and accepted transmission routes are \u2018droplet transmission\u2019, where droplets (>5 \u03bcm diameter, travelling <1 m) containing viable viruses make contact with the nose, mouth, eyes, or upper respiratory tract, and \u2018airborne transmission\u2019, where droplet nuclei (\u22645 \u03bcm diameter, which can travel >1 m) are inhaled by susceptible individuals (Figure 1\n).5, 6, 7, 8 The role of \u2018direct contact transmission\u2019 (not involving contaminated surfaces) and \u2018indirect contact transmission\u2019 (involving contaminated surfaces) in the spread of these viruses with pandemic potential has been controversial (Figure 1).6, 7, 8 However, several reviews and models have suggested that indirect contact transmission is the predominant transmission route for some respiratory viruses, including influenza, in some settings.7, 8, 9\n",

Survival times for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and surrogates such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are generally measured in days, weeks, or months.16, 26, 28, 29, 30, 43 Survival times for influenza virus are generally shorter, often measured in hours rather than days.16, 32, 33, 34 However, some studies have reported considerably longer survival times for influenza virus, measured in days rather than hours.35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42 This apparent conflict is most likely explained by experimental factors. The difference in survival capacity between influenza virus and that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is best illustrated by van Doremalen et al. who tested both H1N1 influenza and MERS-CoV.16 Viable MERS-CoV was recovered after 48 h, with a half-life ranging from \u223c0.5 to 1 h. By contrast, no viable H1N1 was recovered after 1 h under any of the conditions tested.",

Influenza virus RNA was recovered from 38.5% of 13 environmental surfaces around hospitalized patients in Mexico.61 In one case, one out of five surfaces (a bed rail) was positive from a patient's room 72 h after patient discharge and terminal cleaning. Pappas et al. sampled toys in the waiting room of a general paediatric practice, finding that only one out of 59 toys was contaminated with influenza RNA.59 However, a higher proportion of toys was contaminated with picornavirus RNA (19.2%), including four out of 15 after cleaning.

A number of simplifying assumptions were made, which may be unsound \u2013 for example, that people touch portions of the fomite homogeneously, and that pathogens on fomites are homogeneously distributed. Also, transportation of contamination from one type of fomite to another via human hands was not modelled.

The potential for inadequate distribution and contact time during manual cleaning and disinfection, combined with the risk of extended survival of infectious aerosol, may argue for the use of ARD systems. These systems may also have a role in disinfection and reuse of N95/FFP3 respirators.",
