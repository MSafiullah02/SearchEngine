Psychological stress is generally recognized as a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Cohen et al. 30 prospectively studied the relationship between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses. After completing questionnaires assessing the degree of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9 or 14; respiratory syncytial virus; or coronavirus type 229E) and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. Stress was associated in a dose\u2013response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection. In a recent systematic review and meta\u2010analysis, Pedersen et al. 101 conclude that the evidence supports the hypothesis that psychological stress is associated with increased susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infection, consistent with the potential importance of psychological factors in other infectious diseases.",

Genco et al. 44, for example, found a higher risk of more severe periodontal attachment loss (odds ratio = 2.24) and alveolar bone loss (odds ratio = 1.91) among individuals with financial strain and an inadequate coping style, when compared with those with low levels of financial strain within the same coping group, after adjustment for age, gender and cigarette smoking. There is also evidence for psychological modulation of the immune response to viral vaccines. One of the earliest studies was conducted in medical students who were inoculated with the hepatitis B virus vaccine. Both virus\u2010specific T\u2010cell and antibody responses were up\u2010regulated in those students with more stress and less social support 46, 48. Chronic stress associated with caregiving for a spouse with Alzheimer's disease was associated with a less desirable antibody response to an influenza virus vaccine compared with matched controls 69. A similar study in Hong Kong compared 55 caregivers of spouses with chronic conditions that impaired their activities of daily living with 61 matched controls. Participants were injected with trivalent influenza vaccine and were assessed for symptoms of stress and depression. Caregivers had statistically significantly lower cell\u2010mediated immune responses to the influenza vaccine compared with controls 136. Other studies show that caregivers of those with chronic illnesses are at higher risk of infection and immune reaction 20, 91, 133. Collectively, these studies and others 132 suggest that stress and inadquate coping strategies or social support can play a role in the activation or re\u2010activation of herpesviruses and other viral infections in the periodontium. High periodontal loads of active Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus tend to be associated with aggressive periodontitis, whereas latent herpesvirus infections are more common in chronic periodontitis and gingivitis 125.",

Other effects include altered cell trafficking, natural killer cell cytotoxicity changes and alterations in the T\u2010helper 1/T\u2010helper 2 balance, all of which could contribute to the potential for poor immunoresponsiveness to microorganisms and vaccines, susceptibility to infections, re\u2010activation of latent viruses and delays in wound healing 47.

Cytokines can act in autocrine, paracrine and endocrine manners to produce their effects 19.

Both pathways act to increase the expression of tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha and interleukin\u20101beta genes 11. Interleukin\u20106 production is stimulated in an autocrine manner by interleukin\u20101beta, and the major signal transduction factor is signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 92. Opposing these pathways are the glucocorticoid receptors. Glucocorticoid receptors are nuclear receptors that, when bound with cortisol, bind to glucocorticoid\u2010response elements on the promotor regions of genes which code for proinflammatory (and other) molecules, inhibiting transcription 122. In stress, there may be activation of the sympathoadrenal system and the limbic\u2013hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis, both of which may be involved in the production of the chronically inflamed state. Adrenergic mechanisms may account for many of the short\u2010term inflammatory effects of acute stress. Chronic stress, on the other hand, is more likely to be associated with a low\u2010grade state of inflammation 25, 108. Glucocorticoids inhibit the reproductive axis on multiple levels by reducing secretion of gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle\u2010stimulating hormone, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone. The latter inhibitory effects may contribute to sexual dimorphisms of stress\u2010related behavioral syndromes and autoimmune inflammatory disorders 26.",

These states are characterized not only by higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin\u20106, but also by higher than normal levels of acute\u2010phase reactants, the synthesis of which is stimulated in the liver by the proinflammatory cytokines. These include C\u2010reactive protein, fibrinogen and various adhesion molecules 108. There is also evidence of limbic\u2013hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis activation and release of glucocorticoids in the face of ongoing inflammation 27. The latter is thought to take place through several mechanisms. One concept is that glucocorticoid receptors become down\u2010regulated or impaired and insensitive or resistant to the high levels of cortisol. Without a damping mechanism through the glucocorticoid pathway, inflammation persists and exerts damage to vulnerable tissues 29. It is also now established that a number of glucocorticoid receptor gene polymorphisms exist that could play a role in susceptibility to stress\u2010induced inflammation and also that epigenetic mechanisms can alter the glucocorticoid receptor gene 92, 122.",

Evidence also indicates that chronic stress and depression can mediate risk and progression of periodontitis through changes in health\u2010related behaviors, such as oral hygiene, smoking and diet 3, 45. Although stress can adversely impact multiple health\u2010related behaviors, including oral hygiene 32, 58, there is strong evidence that stress plays a contributory role in the pathophysiology of periodontitis. Peruzzo et al. 103 conducted a systematic review of the evidence on the influence of stress and psychological factors on periodontal disease. Of the 14 studies (seven case\u2013control, six cross\u2010sectional and one prospective clinical trial) meeting inclusion criteria for the review, the majority (57%) reported a positive relationship between stress/psychological factors and periodontal disease. Another 28.5% of the studies observed a positive relationship between some characteristics of stress and periodontal disease, demonstrating that the majority of the work published to date examining this relationship have indeed found significant associations 103. In a recent study not included in the systematic review, stress scores and salivary stress markers (chromogranin A, cortisol, alpha\u2010amylase and beta\u2010endorphin) were shown to be significantly correlated with clinical parameters of periodontal disease in 100 adult patients with periodontitis 105. Salivary cortisol and beta\u2010endorphin were significantly associated with tooth loss and periodontal clinical parameters, after adjusting for stress variables. Moreover, the greatest tooth loss was observed in those patients who neglected to brush their teeth during stressful periods 105. The results of these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that stress can modify the host defense and progression of periodontal infections in patients susceptible to periodontitis 37.",

In a case\u2013control study, Moss et al. 90 found that smoking and elevated antibody titers to Tannerella forsythia at baseline were associated with more severe periodontal breakdown in patients scoring high on a depression inventory. In a cross\u2010sectional investigation, patients with rapidly progressive periondontitis showed significantly higher scores on measures of depression and loneliness compared with adults with either chronic periodontitis or without significant clinical attachment loss 89. Genco et al. 44 found that stress and distress manifested as depression was a significant risk indicator for more severe periodontitis in a cross\u2010sectional study of 1,426 subjects between 25 and 74 years of age. Johannsen et al. 65 found that women on long\u2010term sick leave for depression had more severe periodontitis and higher concentrations of interleukin\u20106 in gingival crevicular fluid compared with healthy controls. These clinical results are consistent with findings in an established animal model of depression. Breivik et al. 16 tested whether depression induced by olfactory bulbectomy in rats and treatment with the antidepressant serotonin re\u2010uptake enhancer, tianeptine, could influence susceptibility to ligature\u2010induced periodontitis. When compared with sham\u2010operated controls, olfactory bulbectomy rats were shown to develop significantly more periodontal bone loss. Tianeptine treatment significantly inhibited alveolar bone loss. However, a clomipramine\u2010induced model of depression in Lewis rats did not alter the pathogenesis of ligature\u2010induced periodontitis 127.",

Anttila et al. 5 reported a positive correlation between depression and edentulousness in a sample of 780 Finnish residents. It is noteworthy that depression often manifests with multiple comorbidities, including obesity and diabetes, many of which are independently associated with elevations in systemic markers of inflammation 102. In general, studies exploring the association between depressive symptoms and periodontitis have been based on nonpsychiatric populations without consideration of comorbidities, limiting the potential of these studies to identify an association between depression and periodontal disease.",

Stress, depression and salivary cortisol scores were found to correlate signficantly with severity of periodontitis and the number of missing teeth, when controlling for age, family history and brushing frequency. Moreover, patients who reported neglecting their oral care during stressful or depressed periods exhibited the greatest clinical attachment loss and highest number of missing teeth. In a similar study of 111 dentate patients, \u226540 years of age, Mannem & Chava 82 reported that stress scores and salivary cortisol levels significantly discriminated between patients with and without periodontitis. Similar associations have also been reported between serum levels of the stress\u2010related steroids, such as cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone\u2010sulfate, and measures of periodontal disease 52, 63. Patients with periodontitis often have higher systemic levels of C\u2010reactive protein, interleukin\u20106, interleukin\u20101 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha 104.

Linden et al. 77 found that a measure of occupational stress was a significant predictor of clinical attachment loss in 23 patients with periodontitis in regular periodontal maintenance over a period of nearly 6 years.

            "text": "An extensive body of experimental and clinical evidence documents the negative impact of chronic psychological stress and depression on the immune system and health. Brief stressors appear to suppress cellular immunity whilst preserving measures of humoral immunity; in contrast, chronic stressors generally result in dysregulation of the immune system, involving both cellular and humoral pathways 117. Therefore, chronic stress and depression have been hypothesized to reduce immune responsiveness, resulting in a higher rate of infection with pathogenic organisms and a greater degree of periodontal tissue destruction. In general, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that stress can modify the host immune defense and permit the progression of periodontal infections in patients susceptible to periodontitis 37. However, substantial evidence also indicates that these conditions can mediate risk for disease, including periodontitis, through changes in health\u2010related behaviors, such as oral hygiene, smoking and diet 3, 45. Stress and depression are commonly associated with comorbidities, such as diabetes 96, that can modify the onset and progression of periodontal disease; however, these conditions have generally not been addressed in available studies. In addition, stress and depression appear to fall into a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe, involving a complex interaction of genetic background, coping strategies and environment. Differences in the conceptualization of stress and depression are probably important in assessing associations with other biologic and clinical measures. Elevations in serum markers of inflammation, for example, have been found to be greater in patients diagnosed with depressive disorders than in subjects with depressive symptoms based on standardized inventories 59. Future studies are necessary to clarify the complex interactions of chronic stress and depression in periodontal diseases.",
