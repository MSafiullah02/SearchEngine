One can take advantage of carbohydrate-based interaction for drug discovery, diagnosis, antibiotics, vaccine, etc. This chapter deals with biosensors and microarrays that take advantage of carbohydrates-based interactions with a special interest in devices that are designed for medical applications. A large overview of glycochemistry, followed by the biological role of carbohydrates, is given. Carbohydrate-based biosensors are then described with special emphasis on surface chemistry and signal transduction. Finally, medically relevant applications illustrate the use of carbohydrates as recognition receptors in biosensing.",

            "text": "Glycosylation of proteins is a common post-translational modification, and eukaryotic cells are coated with complex carbohydrates associated with lipids or proteins forming the so-called glycocalix. Carbohydrates are the most abundant type of biomolecules on earth in term of biomass. Their biological role spans from the stabilisation of protein structure to their involvement in crucial biological events such as the development, growth or survival of a cell/organism (Varki 1993; Sharon and Lis 2004; Varki et al. 1999; Dwek 1996; Bertozzi and Kiessling 2001; Bishop et al. 2007 ). For instance, protein-carbohydrate interactions are involved in intracellular trafficking of proteins, cell adhesion, cell recognition, cell differentiation and the development of the neuronal network. They are also involved in pathological events such as inflammation, metastasis (Galonic and Gin, 2007) and host-pathogen interactions (Imberty et al. 2004; Seeberger and Werz 2007) . For example, influenza virus takes advantage of the carbohydrate motifs present on the surface of the respiratory track endothelial cells for adhering to these cells (Skehel and Wiley 2000) . The switch from avian influenza to human influenza sub-type is related to the subtle change of its ability to recognise the glycosylated motif of human respiratory track endothelial cell instead of the avian ones. The elucidation of these interactions is a critical issue not only in terms of fundamental research but also in terms of applied research for the development of diagnosis or new therapeutics.",

It has been calculated that a hexamer can lead to more than 10 12 structures (Laine 1994) . Secondly, carbohydrate synthesis is one of the most difficult and laborious synthetic work, and carbohydrates cannot be amplified enzymatically like DNA (by polymerase chain reaction) or cloned such as proteins. The consequence is that carbohydrate material is difficult to obtain in large amounts at affordable prices. Finally, carbohydrate interactions, especially with proteins, tend generally to be weak unless a multivalent interaction is involved, taking advantage of the so-called cluster effect (Lee and Lee 1995) . Consequently, analysis of carbohydratemediated interactions requires analytical techniques with very low detection limit.",

They are polyfunctional biomolecules with the general formula C n (H 2 O) n (e.g. n = 6 for glucose). The biological aspects of carbohydrates have long been underestimated because of their complexity in comparison to the three other classes of biomolecules. Polypeptides (proteins) and polynucleotides (e.g. DNA or RNA) are linear polymers, whereas carbohydrates are either linear or branched polymers, thereby increasing drastically the number of possible combinations (Laine 1994; Werz et al. 2007) . Recent advances in glycobiology have demonstrated the numerous roles of carbohydrates in a series of biological processes such as storage and transport of energy, signal transduction, fertilisation, immune responses, pathogenesis, blood clotting, virus infection and cell-to-cell communication (Bertozzi and Kiessling 2001; Sharon and Lis 2004; Dwek 1996; Varki 1993; Varki et al. 1999 ). These fundamental discoveries found several applications in the design of carbohydratebased drugs and vaccines against various diseases (Werz and Seeberger 2005b) such as malaria (H\u00f6lemann and Seeberger, 2006; Seeberger and Werz 2007) , cancer (Galonic and Gin, 2007; Livingston and Ragupathi 2006) and AIDS (McReynolds and Gervay-Hague, 2007; Scanlan et al. 2007 ). The ever-increasing number of chemists, biochemists and biologists who are involved in research with carbohydrates is testimony to the fact that there is still a lot more work to be achieved in glycochemistry and glycobiology.",

Aldoses ( Fig. 7 .1) and ketoses (Fig. 7 .2) are polyhydroxylated aldehydes or ketones, respectively, which can cyclise intramolecularly into hemiacetals. The nucleophilic attack of a hydroxyl group on the carbonyl will provide two diastereoisomeric hemiacetals called aand b-anomers. Cyclisation can occur between O-4 and O-5 to form a five-membered ring designated as furanose or a six-membered pyranose ring, respectively ( Fig. 7.3 Atom numbering starts at the most oxidised end of the carbon chain (e.g. carbonyl group for aldoses) and increases along the carbon chain. The cyclic structures of monosaccharides can be represented according to several projections ( Fig. 7.4) . The Fischer projection was the first one to be applied to acyclic forms of sugars, where the carbon chain is drawn vertically with the most oxidised carbon atom (carbonyl) at the top. Later, Haworth designed a projection for a more realistic description of cyclic forms of carbohydrates. The chair conformation provides the most accurate description of the geometry of the carbohydrate ring and should be preferred to other projections. Mills and zig-zag projections are useful when considering the stereochemistry of each carbon atom along the chain.",

This equilibrium is catalysed by acids or bases.

Two explanations can be invoked based on dipolar moments or hyperconjugation (Fig. 7.6 configuration of an electronegative anomeric substituent results in the formation of two similar dipoles repelling each other and destabilizing the molecule. On the contrary, axially orientated substituents create roughly opposed dipoles accounting for a lower energy state. The second explanation to the anomeric effect is the presence of a stabilizing interaction through hyperconjugation between an unshared electron pair of the endocyclic oxygen atom and the s* orbital of the anomeric bond (e.g. C-Br). The orientation of the substituent at the anomeric centre (aglycon) can be described by the exo-anomeric effect (Fig. 7 .7) (Praly and Lemieux 1987; Perez and Marchessault 1978; Thoegersen and Lemieux 1982) In this case, the exocyclic anomeric oxygen atom's lone pair is interacting with the anti-bonding orbital of the endocyclic C-O bond. The exo-anomeric effect can be observed for both aand b-anomers. ",

This reaction is usually promoted by a third partner (promoter) increasing the reactivity of the glycosyl donor. The substitution at the 2-position plays an important role in the stereochemical outcome of the glycosylation process ( Fig. 7.9 ). When a non-participating group is present at the 2-position, the major glycoside obtained is the a-anomer because of the stabilization through the anomeric effect. However, a participating group at the 2-position creates a cationic bis-acetal intermediate hindering the a-face of the pyranose ring and therefore favours the nucleophilic attack of the glycosyl acceptor from the b-face to give rise to the 1,2-trans glycoside. During this process, the alcohol could also form an orthoester which can be rearranged into the desired 1,2-trans glycoside under Lewis acid catalysis (Kochetkov et al., 1967 (Kochetkov et al., , 1971 .",

            "text": "Each glycosylation method can be distinguished through the glycosyl donor/ promoter system involved ( Fig. 7 .9 General strategies used for the formation of 1,2-cis or 1,2-trans glycosides alcohol in the presence of a protic acid promoter was used as one of the first glycosylation method by Fischer (Fischer 1893; Fischer 1895) . It is probably the most appropriate method for the synthesis of simple glycosides (e.g. methyl, benzyl, allyl). Glycosylation was then performed from glycosyl halides in the presence of heavy metal salts by Koenigs and Knorr (Igarashi 1977; Koenigs and Knorr 1901) . Glycosyl fluorides can also be used as glycosyl donors and are much more stable than their chlorinated or brominated analogues (Mukaiyama et al. 1981) . They can be activated under specific conditions compatible with most protecting groups. Peracetylated carbohydrates are particularly convenient for large-scale synthesis and can be also involved in a glycosylation as glycosyl donors but their activation sometimes requires drastic conditions (Helferich and Schmitz-Hillebrecht 1933) . Glycosyl trichloroacetimidates were then introduced by Schmidt and are activated under acidic conditions with either Br\u00f8nsted or Lewis acids usually in the presence of molecular sieves and at low temperature (Schmidt and Michel 1980; Pougny and Sinay 1976) . Arylthioglycosides are highly stable even when stored for long periods on shelves and can also accommodate a large number of chemical reactions on the pyranose ring. They can be activated by thiophilic reagents under mild conditions, and formation of the oxonium intermediate proceeds through the addition of the electrophilic promoter to the sulphur atom (Garegg 1997; Ferrier et al. 1973; F\u00fcgedi et al. 1987) . Activation can also take place under single electron transfer, electrochemical or even high pressure conditions. n-Pentenyl glycosides were introduced by Fraser-Reid as glycosyl donors and are activated through halogenation of the terminal double bond followed by intramolecular cyclisation to provide the oxonium intermediate and a halomethyl-2-furane (Fraser-Reid et al. 1988; Fraser-Reid et al. 1992) . Glycosyl phosphites (Kondo et al. 1992; Martin and Schmidt 1992; Zhang and Wong 2000) react with alcohols at low temperature in the presence of Lewis acids affording the corresponding glycosides, and glycosyl phosphates (Hashimoto et al. 1989; Vankayalapati et al. 2002) can be activated by protic acids. Activation of selenoglycosides (Mehta and Pinto 1991; Mehta and Pinto 1993) can be achieved under similar conditions as for thioglycosides, by photoinduced or single electron transfer or iodine. They can be selectively activated in the presence of thioglycosides. All these glycosylation methods have found numerous applications for the synthesis of natural products or for the selective formation of the desired anomer. One should also consider the influence of protecting groups on the pyranose ring, which sometimes affect the glycosylation outcome.",

Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are natural enzymes capable of creating or hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds in an aqueous medium, using native sugars and with high stereo-and regioselectivities. Their use as \"glycosylating agents\" or promoters has attracted a lot of interest in the scientific community and a series of applications are now available for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharidic structures (Qian et al. 2001 ). This technology requires both biochemical and chemical skills since enzymes sometimes need to be mutated for obtaining the expected result. Sialylation is one of the most difficult glycosylation because of the poor stability of activated sialic acid derivatives. The biochemical engineering of sialyltransferases can readily provide a large series of sialylated derivatives ranging from the glycosylation of simple alcohols to mono-or disaccharides (Drouillard et al. 2006; Blixt et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2006b; Dumon et al. 2006; Muthana et al. 2007; .",

Proteoglycans consist of a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan chains are linked. There are five types of glycosaminoglycan chains: heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate and hyaluronan (or hyaluronic acid). They are linear polymers of disaccharides with variable lengths that are modified by sulfation and/or (de)acetylation to variable extents. The disaccharides are each composed of a uronic acid and a hexosamine. In vasculature, heparan sulfate proteoglycans represent 50-90% of the total amount of proteoglycans present in the glycocalyx (Pries et al. 2000) . Hyaluronan, another important glycosaminoglycan, differs from others because it is not linked to a core protein. Its exact link to the cell membrane is not known, but it can be bound to the receptor CD44 (Nandi et al. 2000) .",

            "text": "Besides the proteoglycans, well-defined glycoproteins bearing small (2-15 sugar residues) and branched carbohydrate side chains connect the glycocalyx to the endothelial cell membrane. These endothelial cell adhesion molecules play a major role in cell recruitment from the bloodstream and in cell signalling. The three families of cell adhesion molecules present in the endothelial glycocalyx are the selectin family, the integrin family and the immunoglobulin superfamily. Selectins are carbohydrate-binding glycoproteins. These glycoproteins were designated as E-, P-and L-selectin, according to the cell type on which the selectin was found (i.e. endothelium, platelets, and lymphocytes, respectively). E-selectin and P-selectin are both involved in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions (Sperandio 2006) . The carbohydrate ligands that are recognised by these selectins have been identified. E-selectin recognizes sialyl Lewis X (sLe X ) on the surface of neutrophils. P-selectin also binds sLe X on neutrophils or leukocytes with a lower affinity. L-selectin weakly recognises sLe X on endothelial cells, but the affinity is higher with a sulphate group on the 6-position of Gal or, perhaps more likely, on the 6-position of the GlcNAc residue. Integrins are heterodimeric molecules composed of non-covalently bound a (18 different a-subunits) and b (8 bsubunits) subunits. Integrins are found on many cell types, including endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets. These integrins, such as a2b1, a5b1 and a6b1, bind to multiple extracellular matrix ligands and are responsible for interactions with laminin, fibronectin, and collagen. Many studies have focused and still focus on the interactions between these integrins and the sub-endothelial matrix during angiogenesis (Ruegg and Mariotti 2003) . The best known immunoglobulin superfamily of glycoproteins includes intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and 2 (ICAM-1 and -2), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). They act as ligand for integrins on leukocytes and platelets and are crucial mediators of leukocyte homing to the endothelium and subsequent diapedesis. In addition, glycoproteins of the endothelial glycocalyx display functionality in coagulation, fibrinolysis and homeostasis.",

However, studies have shown that glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs) not linked to either protein or polysaccharide are major cell-surface glycolipids in trypanosomatids, and are closely related to the structure of the GPI-protein anchor (Ferguson 1999) . The GIPL of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, contains a unique glycan chain expressing slight variations among distinct T. cruzi isolates, and linked through a non-N-acetylated glucosamine residue to an inositol phosphorylceramide, mainly composed of an N-lignoceroyl-dihydrosphingosine (Carreira et al. 1996) . The b-D-Galf-(1!3)-a-D-Manp substructure is involved in its antigenicity (Mendon\u00e7a-Previato et al. 1983 ).

Analysis of Leishmania mutants lacking individual or multiple surface components indicates that only LPG plays a critical role in macrophage infection, while loss of other surface components has relatively little affect on promastigote virulence in the mammalian host (McConville et al., 2007) . The plasma membrane of Leishmania amastigotes is unusual in several other respects.

It was shown that the linkage between sialic acid and the second sugar (usually galactose) could determine whether an influenza virus binds to avian or human cells (Carroll et al. 1981; , and that a single mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) was sufficient to change binding from a-2-3 0 to a-2-6 0 sialyl-lactose and host cells from avian to human, or vice versa Rogers et al. 1985) . Now it is generally accepted that human influenza viruses bind to a-2-6 0 sialic acids and avian viruses bind to a-2-3 0 sialic acids (Baum and Paulson 1990; Matrosovich et al. 1997) , while swine influenza viruses are reported to bind mainly to a-2-6 0 sialic acids and also to a-2-3 0 sialic acid receptors (Ito et al. 1998; Rogers and D'Souza 1989) .",

MR and DC-SIGN both contain lectin domains, but differ distinctly in terms of ligand specificity.

This means that the synthesis of oligosaccharides requires selective protections and deprotections of the desired hydroxyl function for coupling of monosaccharides through a glycosyl bond. Some authors have developed automated solidphase synthesis, while some others have used a \"one-pot\" approach (Feizi et al. 2003; Werz and Seeberger 2005a; Seeberger 2008; Plante et al. 2001) . Still others take advantage of enzymes (glycosidases or glycosyltranferases) to perform the synthesis of oligosaccharides. Glycosidases are enzymes that under usual conditions hydrolyse the glycosidic bond. However, as this reaction is reversible, under defined conditions, the enzyme can catalyse the formation of the linkage. Glycosyltransferases are enzymes that catalyse the glycosidic linkage formation between two saccharides. They are more efficient than glycosidases, giving better yields. However, the number of different enzymes is limited and expensive. The natural substrate of the enzyme is usually expensive as well. These reasons have motivated some authors to engineer whole bacteria with genes coding for the different enzymes required for oligosaccharides synthesis .",

In consequence, like protein arrays (Gordus and Mac Beath 2006) , carbohydrate arrays require the preservation of the 3-D conformations of the saccharide ligand in order to perform specific biomolecular recognition with their receptor. In addition, their accessibility and orientation are major issues especially in the case of immobilised probes where the degrees of freedom are fewer than in solution. Therefore, the surface chemistry employed for immobilisation (the chemical reaction for immobilisation, but also the structure of the spacer arm) of the saccharide and the physico-chemical properties of the surface (and ligand) are major issues in maintaining the biological activity, as they will play key roles not only in the preservation of the 3-D conformation but also in the probe availability. For example, weak interactions between the surface and the probe can influence the orientation of the probe. Surface organisation of the probe (dense packing which depends among other things on the spacer arm structure) can also influence the probe availability. Organisation of the water molecules at the surface of the material may also play a role in the thermodynamics of biological recognition at the surface of the material. The immobilisation should l proceed with good and reproducible yield for a given probe; l proceed with the same yield independently of the probe (especially in the case of glycoarray); l be oriented in order to preserve the \"key-lock\" interaction between the probe and the target and to obtain a reproducible device; l allow the accessibility of the probe by the target although the degree of freedom is reduced; and l allow quality control of immobilised probes.",

In a simple medium where only one protein is present, the entropic factor (Norde 1985; Norde et al. 1986 ) seems to be the driving force for protein adsorption. Entropy is affected by the dehydration of both the surface and the protein, rearrangement of the protein structure and rearrangement of charged groups. The dehydration effect on hydrophobic surfaces can be viewed as the disruption of an ordered ice-like layer of water at the surface of the materials by the incoming protein. This disruption is due to surface-protein hydrophobic interactions that are stronger than the surface-water and protein-water interactions. This leads to an increase in entropy. On hydrophilic surfaces, the driving force is the change in protein structure (Norde et al. 1986 ).",

Such a tail can be introduced by the condensation of the azido functional group with sp2-and sp3-bearing molecules (Fazio et al. 2002) , by aminoreduction (Fukui et al. 2002) or by the condensation of amine with isocyanate ). The group of Wang at Stanford University and the group of Feizi at Imperial College, London, have developed neoglycoconjugates bearing such tails for their immobilisation on nitrocellulose membranes or nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. Oligosaccharides (2-20-mers) are linked to amino phospholipid 1,2-dihexadecylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or its anthracene derivative by reductive amination. The anthracene derivative allows quality control of the relative surface density of the probes (Palma et al. 2006) . The group of Wong has derivatised oligosaccharides with a C14 alkyl chain through Cu (I) -catalysed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. A similar strategy was used by Huang et al. (2005) .

Many examples have been reported. However, it requires long reaction times and the yields are low. To circumvent these drawbacks, other authors have immobilised saccharides through hydrazide (Lee and Shin 2005; or oxime (Zhou and Zhou 2006) linkages. Thiazolidine and glycosyl amide bonds have also been described (Larsen et al. 2006) . The hydrazide linkage is poorly stable at low pH, while oximes are stable over a wider range of pH (Larsen et al. 2006 ). Nevertheless, the immobilisation of unmodified saccharides is advantageous with complex carbohydrates from natural sources. However, the main drawbacks are that the immobilisation reactions are limited to reactions involving the reducing end of the saccharides (and consequently cannot be used with non-reducing sugars) and they often lead to the opening of the reducing end ring while it may be crucial to maintain the structure of the molecule (Larsen et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "It can be advantageous to derivatise the saccharide with a functionalised aglycon allowing for the subsequent immobilisation. Two main strategies can be envisioned. One is the use of an aglycon bearing a function that can react directly with the surface, such as thiolated or disulfide aglycons, which permits the direct immobilisation of the glycoside onto the metal surfaces (gold in particular, Fig. 7 .24). The second is chemically modifying the surface with a hetero cross-linker bearing a functional group for reaction with the surface and a second functional group for reaction with the aglycon (Fig. 7.24) . (1) reaction of thiol with gold, (2) reaction of disulfide with gold, (3) photochemistry using aryl-diazirine, (4) and (5) addition of thiol to maleimide group, (6) disulfide bond formation by oxidation of thiol functions, (7) amide formation by reaction of activated carboxylic group with amine, (8) amide/epoxy substitution, (9) Diels-Alder cycloaddition, (10) copper I-accelerated regiospecific 1, 3-dipolar cycloaddition, (11) Staudinger ligation and (12) reaction between a cyanuric acid chloride and an aminophenyl group Direct reaction. Thiol functions have strong affinity for noble metals such as gold, silver, indium, etc. (see the corresponding chapter 2). Voltametric studies (Wink et al. 1997 ) have shown that upon adsorption thiols are deprotonated, leading to a covalent bond between the thiolate and the gold metal. Disulfide can also strongly bind to gold; however, the resulting films are less compact and less ordered. Many authors have taken advantage of these interactions for the immobilisation of thiol-(or disulfide-) containing biomolecules. In the case of carbohydrates, a mercapto aglycon should be introduced into the molecule. Miura et al. (2002) have reported the immobilisation of Gb3 mimics (a saccharide ligand of the shigatoxins 1 and 2) bearing a disulfide aglycon on a gold substrate. The surface density of the immobilised Gb3 mimics was evaluated with quartz micro-balance measurements. The area per molecules was estimated to be 54 \u00c5 2 , leading to an estimated surface density of approximately 2 \u00c2 10 14 molecules per cm 2 . Ratner et al. have studied the affinity of the protein cyanovirin-N with mannosyl oligosaccharides. Immobilisation on gold substrates for SPR-binding affinity measurements was achieved with thiol derivatives of mannosyl oligosaccharides .",

A quick rinsing with water led to 10 14 molecules per cm 2 , whereas rinsing with hot water led to 10 13 molecules per cm 2 . A further rinsing with SDS led to 3 \u00c2 10 11 molecules per cm 2 .

(2002) have demonstrated that shigatoxins 1 and 2 affinities for immobilised Gb3 mimics (a saccharide ligand of the shigatoxins 1 and 2) were affected by the aglycon alkyl chain length. Gb3 mimics were derivatised with a disulfide bearing 2 or 10 carbon alkyl chains as a spacer. The resulting molecules were self-assembled onto gold surfaces and the affinity of Shigatoxins 1 and 2 were studied. They found that Shigatoxin 1 binds to 2-carbon-derivatised Gb3 five times more strongly than 10carbon-derivatised Gb3, while Shigatoxin 2 binds more strongly to 10-carbonderivatised Gb3. Some authors (Sato et al. 1998 ) have demonstrated that the availability of the carbohydrate probe can be spoiled by steric hindrance due to compact packing. It may that the observed difference is related to the surface organisation of the probe. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the C10 long spacer forms compact layers compared to the C3 long spacer (Grubor et al. 2004) . Huang et al. (2006a) compared the affinity of antibodies for Globo H analogues. Globo H is a glycosphingolipid which is highly expressed on a wide range of tumoral cell lines. They synthesised four analogues of increasing complexity of the saccharide moiety of Globo H with two different aglycons bearing either an amine function or an azido function. The amino derivatives were immobilised on NHS ester-functionalised surfaces, while the azido derivatives were immobilised on alkyne-bearing surfaces through 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition. They found that the affinity of the mouse antibodies (MBr1 or VK-9) for the derivatives linked through an amide function was higher than those linked through a 1,2,3-triazol ring. They interpreted the observation as a difference of solubility between the two types of derivatives, a difference in the coupling yield or the better suitability of the shorter linker for binding.",

Bochner et al. (2005) reported the use of streptavidin-biotin interaction for the immobilisation of sialic acids. One hundred and eighty biotinylated glycosides were immobilised on streptavidin-coated polystyrene titer plates and on streptavidin-coated gold surfaces for SPR measurements (CFG). Linhardt's group immobilised biotinylated heparin for studying the affinity and the kinetic of factor P/heparin interaction (Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2005) . Heparin was conjugated with biotin by the reaction of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin with the free amino groups of unsubstituted glucosamine residues in heparin. Chevolot et al. reported the use of DNA hybridisation for surface immobilisation of glycomimetics (Bouillon et al. 2006; Chevolot et al. 2007 ). Glycomimetics were synthesised as follows: azido glycosides were attached to pendant propargyl residues on a phosphorylated scaffold by means of solid-supported 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The architecture (distance between two saccharides residues, hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) was designed by adjusting the linker between two pendant propargyl residues. Each glycomimetic was tagged with a DNA sequence bearing a cyanine 3 (Cy3) dye. The resulting molecules were immobilised on a DNA array (Dugas et al. 2004) bearing complementary sequence by means of DNA/DNA hybridisation. The fluorescent dye borne by the oligonucleotide permits a quality control of the immobilised molecules. Hybridisation was performed with a 1 mM solution of Cy3 -DNA glycomimetic, leading to a probe surface density of 1-4 \u00c210 10 molecules per cm 2 as estimated by Dugas et al. with radiolabelled oligonucleotides immobilised under the same conditions. The resulting analytical device had a lower detection limit in the nanomolar range (albeit the use of a 1 mM solution of glycomimetic), which is similar to what is described in the literature where typical immobilisation solution concentrations are in the millimolar range.",

They studied the affinity of WGA (Wheat Germ Agglutinin) for different glycolipids and found that the maximum affinity of WGA for GM 3 and GM4 was for a monolayer containing 20% GM (Sato et al. 1998) . Similar results were found by Ebara (Ebara and Okahata 1994) with concanavalin A and glycolipids. This phenomenon was attributed to steric hindrance due to the compact packing of the carbohydrate heads in gangliosides monolayers (not mixed) limiting the access to WGA.",

The markers can be fluorescent, radioactive or electroactive species. Detection by fluorescence is a semi-quantitative and sensitive technique with high spatial resolution but the quenching and blenching phenomena must be monitored. Nowadays, read-out and analyses are made with standard commercial fluorescence scanners. Detection using radioactive labels such as 125 I, 32 P or 33 P is a more quantitative method but the weak spatial resolution and both the inherent safety and waste disposal problems have directed studies towards alternative solutions. Spe-cificity of the recognition signal must be ensured by careful washing protocols to remove non-specifically labelled probes adsorbed out of the surface without breaking the specific binding. A drawback is that the detection is performed a posteriori, out of the liquid environment and in dry conditions, which hides the analysis of the kinetics of the interactions. Advantage of these methods is that they are particularly well adapted for the parallel and massive detection analysis of numerous spots, as for instance with the DNA biochips performed by Affymetrix containing more 400,000 spots per cm 2 .",

These molecules are capable, under illumination with a monochromatic light corresponding to their absorption maximum, of reaching an excited state. They return to the ground state by emitting a photon. The energy of the outcoming photon is less than that of the absorbed photon due to loss of energy by a non-radiative process. The difference between the maxima (in wavelength) in the excitation spectrum and the emission spectrum is called the Stokes shift. The ratio between absorbed photon and emitted photon is the fluorescence quantum yield. Table 7 .4 gives some of the commonly used fluorescent dyes. Fluorescein and related molecules (Alexa, Oregon green, rhodamine, etc.) are four-ring structures with conjugated double bounds. FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) is affordable but has several drawbacks (Schena 2003 ). It is sensitive to self-quenching and photobleaching, and the fluorescent signal is influenced by pH (Schena 2003) . The parent molecules of FITC (Alexa, Texas red, Oregon green, etc.) have additional polar, aliphatic and/or hetero cyclic groups that influence their excitation and emission spectra. These molecules are in general photostable. Furthermore, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH change over a broad range, have high fluorescence quantum yield and a long half-life of the excited state (Schena 2003) .",

Due to the low affinity of the hemagglutinincarbohydrate interaction, they developed an approach based on two antibodies. Sandwich technique consists in a first recognition step between probe and unlabelled target following by a secondary recognition step between the formed complex and a labelled interacting protein interact with the microarray. Next, the slides are incubated with a labelled anti-His6 mouse antibody followed by the incubation with a second labelled antibody directed against mouse antibody. With this approach, the signal is amplified, allowing the probing of weak interactions. Usually, fluorescence give semi-quantitative results.

Using Maxwell's equations, one unique value for thickness and for refractive index of the layer of molecules is true for both phases of light. DPI gives absolute measurements and allows full characterisation in terms of mass, thickness and refractive index of the layer to be formed. It allows measurements in real time of probe coverage and probe orientation and then to follow in real time the biological interaction.

He simultaneously developed a method for measuring the characteristic frequency (resonant frequency) and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency-determining component of an oscillator circuit. His method continues to be used as the primary tool in QCM experiments for the conversion of frequency to mass and is valid in nearly all applications under vacuum or gas.",

QCM measures the mass per unit area by measuring the change in frequency of a quartz crystal resonator. The resonance is disturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass on the surface of the acoustic resonator. When a thin film is attached to the sensor crystal, the frequency decreases. If the film is thin and rigid, the decrease in frequency is proportional to the mass of the film. In this way, the QCM operates as a very sensitive balance. The mass of the adhering layer is calculated by using the Sauerbrey's relation. For instance, with a crystal of resonant frequency 6 MHz, and considering an active crystal surface of 0.2 cm 2 and a frequency resolution of 1 Hz, we can detect a change of 2.46 ng. For a long time, the main application of QCM consisted in monitoring thin-film deposition in vacuum or in gas phase (King, 1964) . When QCM was used in liquid environments (Bruckenstein and Shay 1985) , the number of applications increased dramatically, in particular in the biology field. For instance, an adsorbed protein monolayer on a surface electrode of 1 cm 2 adds a mass of a few hundred nanograms (Muratsugu et al. 1993) . But, the Sauerbrey equation developed for oscillation in air must be applied only to rigid masses attached to the crystal. Besides the mass, other physico-chemical parameters (such as viscosity, roughness, temperature) can induce a change in the resonant frequency. Thus, in liquid environment, Kanazawa and Gordon (1985) showed that quartz crystal microbalance measurements can be performed, in which case a viscosity-related decrease in the resonant frequency will be observed:",

Gold is usually used as the electrode material. When an alternating electric field is applied across the quartz crystal between the upper and lower electrodes, a mechanical oscillation of the characteristic frequency (f) is generated in the crystal. This resonant frequency shifts as a function of the additional bound material occurring at the upper surface. For adapting this system to molecular recognition, the metal surface is specifically biofunctionalised with a selective, passivating layer on which the analyte-specific receptor is immobilized. Appropriate flow channels with monitored microfluidics allow controlled introduction of the analyte. Nowadays, commercial QCM integrate user-friendly software for characterising the biomolecular interactions at the surface. A large variety of surface coatings have been proposed, allowing several optimized chemical treatments and biomolecule as the receptor grafting depending on the aimed interactions. Apart from the standard gold material, which is the most commonly used sensor surface because Au is chemically inert and easy to modify in different ways, we can find in product catalogues (Q Sense) electrode materials such as silicon dioxide whose main advantage is the ability to form lipid bilayers which act as a platform for further immobilisation of molecules; stainless steel surfaces used for studies of biofilm formation; titanium-coated surfaces mainly used for implant research; metals and oxides (aluminium trioxide, platinum, tantalum, tantalum nitride, tungsten, copper, chromium, iridium, iron, silicon carbide, iron carbide, silver and cobalt); and more recently commercially available polymers (polysterene, PMMA) deposited by spin coating.",

For instance, conformation of proteins on the surface affect drastically their recognition activities, the spacer between the surface and receptor appears as crucial factor and, in the case of lectin-carbohydrate interaction, the number of sugar monomers in the oligosaccharide chain strongly influence the interaction. Thus, uncontrolled immobilisation of receptor on biosensor surface could lead to meaningless results.

Gold-plated quartz crystals were drop-coated with polystyrene before being covered with mannan in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and complete blocking was achieved with BSA to obtain a stable baseline. The plant lectin concanavalin A was injected as target species alone or in presence of potential inhibitor library components. Between each screening of libraries, the Con A binding to the surface must be carefully released. Yates et al. (2006) affirm that QCM-D provides a unique means to explore the change in mass and the molecular flexibility of oligosaccharides, GAG (glycoaminoglycans) chains and entire proteoglycans and their complexes with proteins thanks to the ability to form membranes mimetics on the sensor surface in an environment that approximates that of the cell surface. Nagase et al. (2003) used a lectin coated on the silver face of a piezoelectric crystal biosensor for oligosaccharide analysis. They used it for the detection of dissolved sugars and identification of erythrocytes, and obtained a detection limit approaching 100 cells. Miura et al. (2004) used the QCM for investigating the biological functions of their synthetic glycoconjugate polymers with respect to lectins and Shiga toxin-1 (Stx-1) produced by the pathogen Escherichia coli. QCM detector was covered by a Gb3C10 SAM. First they demonstrated that the addition of Stx-1 to aqueous solutions induced a frequency reduction depending on the concentration. The binding affinity of Stx-1 to Gb3C10 SAM was estimated to be 1.2 \u00c2 10 8 (M \u00c01 ). Secondly, upon addition of their glycoconjugates, they exhibited a notable inhibitory activity for the adhesion of Stx-1 to the Gb3C10 SAM (degree of inhibition going from 15% up to 70% versus glycoconjugate).",

In the case of ISFET, an ion-sensitive membrane is put in place of the metallic layer. This structure is intrinsically blocked, so no current flows between source and drain because whatever the potential applied at this two areas, one of the p-n junction is in reverse polarisation. When a positive voltage V G is applied between the gate and the source, the majority of holes tend to be repelled while the minority electrons of the p-substrate move to the channel. For V G > V T (V T is the threshold voltage), the electron density becomes larger than the hole density and the formation of n-type channel ensures electrical continuity between the source and the drain; the current flows from source to the drain.

The presence of the resulting products from the enzymatic reactions can be detected through the pH variation induced at the ISFET surface on which specific enzymes have been grafted. In this case, ISFET is called ENFET (enzymatic field effect transistor). Numerous molecular species can be detected by ENFET: for example, urease, glucose, organophosphorous pesticides. This type of transducer was also adapted for the detection of DNA hybridization. In this case, the SiO 2 thin film was coated with an APTS (3aminopropyltriethoxysilane) layer on which single-strand DNA was immobilised. This FET put in contact with a solution containing complementary DNA strands shows a strong drain current resulting from the field effect induced by the arrival of the negative charge borne by DNA strands under hybridisation (Souteyrand et al. 1997) . This device was called GENFET. To exploit this field effect on a microarray, Souteyrand et al. (2000) described a technique based on the optoelectrochemical impedance measurement in which electrical excitation is replaced by modulated light for scanning the surface of a electrolyte/DNA modified dielectric layer/semiconductor and for detecting directly the hybridisation on spots.",

The epitopes (including Globo H) were synthesised using \"one-pot\" programmable synthesis and modified with an aglycon bearing an amino or an azido function. The glycosides were covalently immobilised on a glass support using ester-activated or alkyne-modified glass slides. Affinities for MBr1 and VK-9 were probed with FITC-labelled secondary antibodies. It was shown that the monoclonal antibodies bind the terminal tetrasaccharides as well as the natural hexasaccharides and that the fucose residue is compulsory for binding. However, serum from patients with breast cancer binds both the fucosylated and defucosylated pentasaccharide, probably due to the polyclonal nature of the serum.

Their efficiency has decreased as a result of the Fig. 7 .28 Structure of Globo H emergence of resistant strains. The resistance mechanism is usually due to enzymatic modification of the molecules such as aminoglycoside acetyl transferases. Disney et al. have used aminoglycoside microarrays for probing the affinity of three acetyl transferases (from Salmonella enterica and from Mycobacterium tuberculosis) towards aminoglycoside antibiotics (Disney and Seeberger 2004a; Disney et al. 2004) . They also studied new aminoglycosides as inhibitors of these enzymes. Based on their microarray experiment, they identified new aminoglycosides with low affinity towards the acetyl transferases, meaning they are less susceptible to enzymatic transformation by the bacteria, as well as being a potent inhibitor.",

This mannose oligosaccharide has been considered a potential target for the design of vaccine (it interacts with the 2G12 antibody (Calarese et al. 2005) ) or as potential target for prophylactic measures. In the latter case, proteins interacting with the hyper-mannosylated moiety of GP120 would prevent the entry of the virus into the host cell. Adams et al. designed a glyco array bearing different mannose and studied the affinities of 2G12, CD4, Scytovirin (a potential anti-HIV protein), Cyanovirin N (CVN, a cyano bacteria protein with potential anti-HIV properties) and the dendritic cell lectin DC SIGN involved the internalisation of the virus. Detection was performed with FITC labelling . It was shown that each protein has specific requirements concerning the structure of the mannosyl oligosaccharide. For example, an a-1-2 linkage alone is necessary for the interaction of 2G12. The binding profile of the Scytovirin showed that the terminal a-1-2 mannose linkage at the terminal non-reducing end is required.",

Influenza virus is an enveloped virus with a segmented negative RNA genome. Its envelope bears two proteins: hemagglutinin (HA, around 5,000 copies) and neuraminidase (3-500 copies). HAs interact with the sialic acids present at the surface of the host cell, permitting adhesion of the virus. It is the specificity of the HA towards the sialic acid linkage that determines the host specificity of the influenza virus. Human influenza viruses preferentially bind the a-2-6 linkage present at the surface of the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory track and lungs, while the avian ones recognise the a-2-3 linkage present in epithelial cells of the intestine of birds. Therefore, the subtle switch from avian to human subtype is related to the HA affinity to a-2-6.",

            "text": "Using whole cells, the biosensor takes advantage of the natural multivalency of carbohydrate binding on the cell surface. Indeed, in nature, multivalency is often achieved by the self-association of lectine at the cellular surface upon interaction with carbohydrates (Nimrichter et al. 2004) . Several authors have reported the use of whole-cell detection by means of carbohydrate/whole cell interactions. Disney and Seeberger (2004b) have reported the use of microarrays as a means for probing bacteria (E. coli) affinities for immobilised oligomannose. E. coli strains were stained with a fluorescent cell-permeable nucleic acid dye and incubated on the microarray. They demonstrated that the platform allows discriminating strains according to their affinities for mannose residues. This issue is critical since the ability of screening cells' affinity for different carbohydrate affinities is related to their pathogenicity. The ability of the microarray to sense multiple carbohydratebased interactions in one single experiment allows profiling pathogen-carbohydrate affinities. This should permit establishing a \"finger print\" like identification of the pathogen present in a complex medium. They also showed that they could identify E. coli from complex media such as a serum containing erythrocytes. Anti-adhesive molecule activities were evaluated using such arrays. They compared the IC 90 s of mannose, p-nitro mannose and mannose-containing polymers. Chevolot et al. (2001) tested the effect of galactose and a lactose-derivatised surface on primary rat hepatocytes. They found that their viability and xenobiotic metabolism were not affected, while neutral red uptake and MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) activity increased with galactose surface density. Neutral red uptake is related to the lysosomal activity. They hypothesised that this may related to the natural lysosomal activity of hepatocytes in correlation with the asialoglycoprotein receptor.",
