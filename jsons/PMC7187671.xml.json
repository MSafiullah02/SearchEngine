This was the first time the CJEU has given a judgment on this provision. Starting from the presumption that Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR interferes with freedom of expression (2), we argue that applying an empirical test under Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR is incompatible with freedom of expression (3). We then assess whether and to what extent the test developed by the CJEU is empirical (4), before pointing out potential shortcomings of that test (5).",

Freedom of expression was not considered in the CJEU\u2019s interpretation of Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR. The AG also explicitly wondered what the confirmation that freedom of expression applies in the field of trade mark law \u201cbrings to the solution of the present case\u201d,7 without further pursuing this route.

The provision would have to be interpreted in a way which makes this inference justified. The interference with freedom of expression and/or a serious issue with its justification in relation to morality bars have generally been contested by the EUIPO as well as (national) courts and legal scholars.9 However, according to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the refusal of a trade mark application amounts to an interference with the applicant's exercise of their freedom of expression and requires justification.10",

For that reason, an empirical approach does not assist the state\u2019s attempts to enforce objective moral values.20 Instead, it turns the is into an ought, merely preserving the status quo of individual beliefs, independent of an objective framework of moral values. Additionally, the refusal to register cannot even effectively preserve the status quo, since the individual beliefs are due to change for reasons other than (non-)registration of a trade mark, because the refusal to register a sign in itself does not hinder (even commercial) usage of such sign due to the nature of a trade mark as a negative right. All that an empirical approach appears to do is slow down societal change without any apparent justification for such preservation. If one wants to see Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR as a policy tool to strengthen objective values, its efficacy under an empirical approach is a matter of coincidence, that is whether the supported objective values match the status quo of subjective beliefs.",

Assuming that Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR aims to raise public welfare and health by reducing the number of instances where people encounter trade marks which are contrary to their personal beliefs and thus to reduce negative emotions caused by such encounters,21 this appears to favor prima facie an empirical approach. Indeed, an empirical approach is able to identify a problem \u2013 that is, a clash of (a) personal beliefs with (b) a certain trade mark resulting in (c) negative emotions. However, because both clashing components in this scenario are mere matters of facts and both are detached from an objective moral framework, this begs the question why the trade mark must give way to get rid of the negative emotions caused by the clash.",

This holds especially true since denying a sign trade mark protection pursuant to Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR does not as such prevent the use of that sign in commerce or otherwise. Looking at empirical evidence,25 one could argue that morality bars are not (very) effective in reducing the use of such signs, in turn also rendering Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR incapable of reducing harm by way of reducing the use of such signs.",

Some argue that signs contrary to morality are not capable of distinguishing, as the negative emotional impact caused by a conflict with the subjective values of the consumer encountering the sign superimposes the message regarding the origin of the goods. The message contrary to a person\u2019s subjective values \u201cwill dominate source identification\u201d.27 This understanding necessarily entails an empirical concept, since the assumption of superimposition builds on the actual effect the sign has on people.28 However, this assumption, and thus the idea that Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR serves the primary goal of trade mark protection, is strongly contested.29 An understanding of Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR as serving ancillary goals external to the main rationale of trade mark law is prevalent in the literature30 and inherent in the reasoning of both the Advocate General31 and the CJEU\u2019s judgement, which is not at all concerned with distinctiveness.

First, insofar as the test is empirical, any refusal of \u201cimmoral\u201d signs is tainted with the problems discussed in the Sect. 3 above. Second, the test seems to lack foreseeability. This puts pressure on the requirement that an interference with freedom of expression is \u201cprescribed by law\u201d under Art. 10(2) ECHR. Even though the broad wording of a provision restricting freedom of expression, such as the term \u201cmorality\u201d, is not in and of itself problematic, it is necessary that its interpretation in practice is accessible to the affected party and foreseeable with regard to its effects, so that they are able to adjust their behavior accordingly.53 Consistent, clear and abundant case law can suffice to fulfill this requirement.54 Otherwise, the restriction imposed on freedom of expression may not be regarded as \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the sense of Art. 10(2) ECHR, and thus not justified.55 It is doubtful that this judgment can be seen as a step towards the necessary clarification, especially given the de facto absence of traceable reasoning. The only interpretative tool used by the CJEU was that of a term\u2019s usual meaning and the context in which it is generally used.56 In contrast to other decisions, however, the usual meaning of the term was not even established in relation to everyday language let alone the legislative context or the purpose of the provision.57 The only trace is a reference to the similar definition by the AG.58 This lack of any interpretive signposts takes away from the transparency of the decision and adds to the legal uncertainty surrounding the test. The lack of purposive interpretation also means that the judgment is of little help in answering the question whether Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR does pursue legitimate aims (and is proportionate in relation to these aims) under Art. 10(2) ECHR.",
