The recently described human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus appears not to fall precisely into any of these groups Marra, et al., 2003, Rota, et al., 2003. Members of group 1 share identity with the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and [officially, as of 2000 (Enjuanes et al., 2000)] include TGEV [and strain porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV)], canine coronavirus (CCoV), feline coronavirus (FECoV) [and strain feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)], human respiratory coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Members of group 2 share identity with the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and include bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human respiratory coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (HEV), rat coronavirus (RtCoV) [and strain sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus (SDAV)] (Enjuanes et al., 2000). Members of group 3 share identity with the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and include IBV and turkey enteric coronavirus (TCoV) Enjuanes et al., 2000, Guy, 2000. Coronaviruses likely to become officially classified as group 2 members on the basis of antigenic relatedness and genome sequence similarities include human enteric coronavirus-4408 (HECoV-4408) (Zhang et al., 1994), puffinosis virus (PV) (Klausegger et al., 1999), and equine enteric coronavirus (ECoV) (Guy et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Recombination among coronaviruses is an attribute of the genus and is thought to contribute to the emergence of new pathotypes Lai, 1992, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997. Curiously, recombination so far has been noted only between species of the same group, for example, between the feline and canine enteric coronaviruses (Herrewegh et al., 1998), between strains of MHV (Keck et al., 1988), and between strains of IBV Jia et al., 1995, Kottier et al., 1995, although in principle intergroup recombination is possible based on reverse genetics experimentation in which an MHV chimera was produced with the ectodomain portion of the FeCoV spike protein gene (Kuo et al., 2000). Inasmuch as natural recombination events among coronaviruses probably result from a polymerase jumping mechanism during coinfection Brian and Spaan, 1997, Lai, 1992, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, signals read by the RNA polymerase complex to initiate and carry out genome replication are likely to contribute to the recombination process. It would therefore be expected that viruses sharing signals for RNA polymerase recognition would be more likely to undergo recombination than those that do not. Characterization of common signals for RNA synthesis, therefore, may aid in predicting which viruses are likely to recombine during a natural coinfection.",

            "text": "To date, common 3\u2032-proximal replication signaling elements have been noted between MHV and BCoV, both group 2 members for which DI RNAs have been studied. In an MHV-A59-derived DI RNA, which comprised only the virus genomic termini, and in the MHV-A59 genome, it has been shown that the entire 3\u2032 UTR of BCoV is able to replace the equivalent region without loss of DI RNA replicability or virus viability Hsue and Masters, 1997, Hsue et al., 2000. Likewise, in a BCoV DI RNA that comprised only the virus genomic termini (Fig. 1;\nChang et al., 1994) it has been shown that the MHV-A59 3\u2032 UTR was able to replace the BCoV 3\u2032 UTR with no detectable loss of replicating ability (S. Ku, G.D. Williams, and D.A. Brian, unpublished data). The partially characterized 3\u2032 UTR-mapping cis-acting elements in BCoV and MHV include a 5\u2032-proximal bulged stem-loop Hsue and Masters, 1997, Hsue et al., 2000, a 5\u2032-proximal hairpin-type pseudoknot (Williams et al., 1999), a centrally located stem-loop (Liu et al., 2001), and a 3\u2032-terminal poly(A) tail (Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000). What roles the higher order structures play are not clear since the 3\u2032-terminal 55-nts and poly(A) tail are thought to be the minimal sequence requirements for minus-strand synthesis (Lin et al., 1994). Common 5\u2032-proximal replication signals between MHV and BCoV have not yet been described. For both MHV and BCoV DI RNAs it has been shown that the 5\u2032-terminal sequence is required for DI RNA replication Chang et al., 1994, Kim et al., 1993 and in BCoV DI RNA at least two stem-loops identified as stem-loops III and IV function as higher order cis-acting signaling elements (Raman et al., 2003; S. Raman and D. Brian, unpublished data). A higher order cis-acting structure mapping within the first 290 nts of ORF1 has also been found (C. Brown, K. Nixon, S. Senanayake, and D. Brian, unpublished data). Might these elements be common between MHV and BCoV as well? To what extent might 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-proximal replication signals be shared among other group 2 members?",

Our results suggest that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR, and 5\u2032 UTR-adjacent sequence patterns, may be subgrouped into those that are BCoV-like and those that are MHV-like. This bifurcated pattern is consistent with a proposed subgrouping of group 2 coronaviruses on the basis of activities of the hemagglutinin-esterase proteins (Wurzer et al., 2002). The diverged UTR patterns, therefore, raised the question as to whether the two subgroups of group 2 coronaviruses might differ with respect to their RNA replication signals as measured by replication assays. To begin to answer this, we tested replication in trans of a BCoV DI RNA with various group 2 helper viruses and learned that replication was supported by all five viruses within the BCoV-like subgroup, and by MHV-H2, the only virus tested within the MHV-like subgroup. It was also found that the BCoV DI RNA acquired the leader sequence of HCoV-OC43 helper virus, thereby demonstrating for the first time an in vivo (in this case, in cell-culture) recombination event between molecules of an animal and human coronavirus. These results indicate that the signals for recognition and engagement by the RNA replication machinery are probably common among group 2 coronaviruses, regardless of subgroup classification, and indicate a potential for recombination among members of the group should mixed infections occur.",

To examine potentially conserved features in these regions among the group 2 coronaviruses, the 5\u2032 UTR sequences, 5\u2032 UTR-adjacent 289 nts, and 3\u2032 UTR sequences of HCoV-OC43, HECoV-4408, HEV-TN11, ECoV-NC99, and SDAV were determined and compared with the published sequences for BCoV-Mebus, MHV-A59, MHV-2, and MHV-JHM (see GenBank Accession Nos. described below and Fig. 2, Fig. 3).\nFor PV, the 3\u2032 UTR was also compared (Fig. 3). Upon alignment it became apparent by inspection that there were several regions, up to 18 nts in length in the 5\u2032 UTR and adjacent 289 nts and up to 29 nts in the 3\u2032 UTR, that were identical among all the viruses examined (identified by shading in Fig. 2, Fig. 3). It was likewise apparent that there were several smaller regions in which sequences diverged considerably, yielding patterns that would suggest the viruses could be grouped into those that are either BCoV-like or MHV-like. The existence of a two-cluster pattern was confirmed in separate phylogenetic analyses of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs and of the amino acid sequences in the partial ORF adjacent to the 5\u2032UTR (Figs. 4A\u2013C).\n",

Ku, G.D. Williams, and D.A. Brian, unpublished data), indicating the presence of common 3\u2032-proximal replication signals. Common 5\u2032 proximal RNA replication signals have not been similarly sought. To test for the presence of common replication signals, the accumulation of reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA (transcripts of pDrep1; Fig. 1) was tested with five of the BCoV-like and one of the MHV-like group 2 helper viruses described (Figs. 5A\u2013C). For this, HRT-18 cells were mock infected or infected with BCoV-Mebus, HCoV-OC43, ECoV-NC99, HECoV-4408, HEV-TN, or MHV-H2, transfected 1 h later with pDrep1 RNA, and total RNA from cells was extracted at 1, 24, and 48 h posttransfection, and at 24 h after infection with passage 1 virus (and in some cases passage 2 virus) for measurement of DI RNA accumulation. Accumulation was measured by Northern blotting using a pDrep1 reporter-specific radiolabeled probe. In the absence of helper virus, transfected DI RNA has a measured half-life of less than 4 h and no accumulation is observed at 24 h posttransfection Chang et al., 1994, Chang and Brian, 1996, Senanayake and Brian, 1999; data not shown). The results for the BCoV-like viruses shown in Figs. 5A and C illustrate a net accumulation of progeny DI RNA molecules by 24 and 48 h posttransfection, and by 24 h after virus passaging (Fig. 5A, lanes 1\u20134), establishing that common replication signals are recognized by the BCoV-like coronaviruses tested. It should be noted that whereas helper virus replication rates for the viruses other than BCoV were less than that for BCoV at 24 hpi through VP1 [ranging from 1 to 50%, as measured by reprobing the stripped blot for viral mRNAs with a universally sensitive 3\u2032 UTR-detecting probe (3\u2032UTRPSEU, Table 1)] (Figs. 5A, B, and D), BCoV DI RNA replication measured at the same time points was relatively higher (ranging from 5 to 100%) (Figs. 5A\u2013C). While the quantitative measurements made here are not precise enough to establish the relative efficiencies of DI RNA replication by the various helper viruses, or the relative inhibitory effects on virus replication by the DI RNA, they do establish a helper virus function for DI RNA replication in each case.",

            "text": "In previous studies on the regulatory effects of BCoV genomic 5\u2032 UTR sequence on translation (Senanayake and Brian, 1999) it was learned that whereas BCoV replicated in murine OST-7 cells [a T7 RNA polymerase-expressing mouse L cell-derived line (Elroy-Stein and Moss, 1990)] nearly as well as in human rectal tumor cells [HRT-18 cells used for BCoV propagation (Chang et al., 1994)] the replication of transfected pDrep1 transcripts could not be observed at all with BCoV helper virus in the murine cells. An attempt was therefore made to test for the helper effect of MHV in HRT cells. For this we used the MHV-H2 strain that had been selected as a host range mutant of a MHV-A59/JHM recombinant on persistently infected BHK cells now able to grow on human cells (Baric et al., 1997). In MHV-H2-infected HRT cells, pDrep1 RNA accumulated as well as in HCoV-OC43 and ECoV-NC99 helper virus infected cells through 48 h posttransfection (20\u201340% of BCoV helper virus levels vs 15\u201340%, respectively; Fig. 5B, lanes 1\u20134), but not as well after virus passage 1 (5% of BCoV helper virus levels vs 40\u2013100%: Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 6, and Fig. 5C). These results indicate that MHV can serve as a helper virus for the replication of BCoV DI RNA and thus there are 5\u2032-proximal as well as 3\u2032-proximal cis-acting replicating signaling elements in BCoV DI RNA recognized by the MHV RNA replication apparatus. RNA replication signals are therefore likely to be common between the two viruses. The relatively low abundance of BCoV RNA in VP1 and VP2 of MHV-infected cells (Fig. 5B, lane 5) suggests, furthermore, that MHV does not package the BCoV DI RNA as well as do the BCV-like helper viruses. A difference in migration rates between marker DI RNA (Fig. 5B, lane 1) and intracellular DI RNA (Fig. 5B, lanes 2\u20136) has been previously observed Chang et al., 1994, Senanayake and Brian, 1999 and apparently represents an in-gel displacement of intracellular DI RNA by abundant comigrating cellular RNA species.",

Leader switching is thought to result from a high-frequency recombination step that is similar, but not necessarily identical to, the RdRp jump by which leader is acquired on coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs Brian and Spaan, 1997, Chang et al., 1996, Makino and Lai, 1989, Zhang and Lai, 1996. It was therefore anticipated that if replication of BCoV DI RNA resulted from the use of a heterologous group 2 coronavirus that the progeny DI RNA would acquire the leader of the helper virus. This possibility was sought on DI RNA progeny in cells infected with all helper viruses except HECoV, which has a leader sequence indistinguishable from that of BCoV. Leader switching was observed for HCoV-OC43 (four of four cDNA clones in VP1 RNA), ECoV (three of four clones), and HEV (three of four clones), but not for MHV (zero of eight cDNA clones examined and data not shown). In the sequence data from one of the VP1 cDNA clones from HCoV-OC43 helper virus (Fig. 5E) it can be seen that the recombination site occurred somewhere between HCoV-OC43 marker nt A95 and BCoV marker nt C133, slightly downstream of a high-frequency leader switching window (nts 70\u201393) previously identified in BCoV (Chang et al., 1996). These results confirm and extend our understanding of the high-frequency nature of leader switching by strains of group 2 coronaviruses and document for the first time a recombination event between human and animal coronavirus molecules.",

The significance of this divergence, however, is not clear since the replication apparatus of one virus will replicate the DI RNA of another, at least in the one-way tests employed here. Although we cannot judge the relative efficiencies of the helper viruses used since replication rates differed in the HRT cells, we think it quite likely that UTR sequence differences reflect a fine-tuning of structural interactions between each virus genome and its cognate replication apparatus for optimal replication. Since previous studies had shown that the 3\u2032 terminus is interchangeable between the BCoV and MHV 3\u2032 UTRs (Hsue and Masters, 1997; S. Ku, G.D. Williams, and D.A. Brian, unpublished data), the new information derived from this study is that there are also shared signals in the genome 5\u2032 terminus. It remains to be determined what explains the lower rate of accumulation and packaging for BCoV DI RNA with MHV-H2 helper virus as compared to the BCoV-like helper viruses. It also remains to be determined what precise signaling elements are shared among the members of the group.",

            "text": "It has been found in a number of coronavirus DI RNA systems that DI RNA upon replication takes on the leader of the helper virus. The same was found here for the BCoV DI RNA and all helper viruses with a distinguishable leader sequence except for MHV. The absence of leader switching with MHV may reflect the relatively poor replication of MHV-H2 in BCoV DI RNA-transfected cells or it may possibly reflect other mechanistically incompatible features. The data showing leader switching with HCoV-OC43 are, to our knowledge, the first to document an in vivo recombination event between molecules of a human and animal coronavirus. Coronavirus leader switching has been compared mechanistically to RdRp strand switching that gives rise to leader-containing subgenomic transcripts Chang et al., 1996, Makino and Lai, 1989, Zhang and Lai, 1996. A demonstration of leader switching therefore raises the question of whether the heterologous helper viruses can support synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs from the BCoV DI RNA template as has been previously observed in the BCoV Krishnan et al., 1996, Ozdarendeli et al., 2001 and MHV Makino et al., 1991, van der Most et al., 1994 homologous systems. Preliminary experiments indicate that they do (H.-Y. Wu and D.A. Brian, unpublished data), but that the patterns of transcription differ among the helper viruses, suggesting a different RdRp mechanism and hence probably different signaling processes are at play between the processes of transcription and replication (H.-Y. Wu, A. Ozdarendeli, and D. Brian, unpublished data). A mechanistic separation of transcription and replication has been noted in arteriviruses (van Dinten et al., 1997), a family placed along with coronaviruses in the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh et al., 1997).",

Nucleotides and amino acid residues were aligned in a manner that minimized the number of gaps, and nucleotide positions between the first identical nucleotide in all positions and the gaps were omitted from phylogenetic calculations to minimize ambiguity. Sufficiency of the phylogenetic \u201csignal\u201d in each aligned dataset was assessed by the random tree-length distribution method implemented in PAUP* (Version 4.0b10; Hillis and Hulsenbeck, 1992, Swofford, 1996. The sequence alignments contained sufficient information for valid phylogenetic analyses (g1 skew statistics \u22120.61, \u22120.55, and \u22121.033 for 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR, and 5\u2032 partial ORF, respectively). Phylogenetic frameworks were inferred from nucleotide sequences by maximum likelihood in PAUP* with settings that correspond to the HKY85 + G model (two-substitution types, four rate categories following a \u03b3-distribution with no invariant sites and nucleotide frequencies, transition/transversion ratio, and the \u03b3-shape parameter estimated by maximum likelihood). Bootstrap proportions were calculated from 100 resampled datasets by using neighbor-joining (Kimura two-parameter model, transition/transversion ratio of 2) and maximum parsimony, also in PAUP*. Phylogenetic relationships among amino acid sequence translations for the partial 5\u2032 ORF were inferred by neighbor-joining from distances calculated by using the PAM matrix of amino acid substitution frequencies, as implemented in PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 1993). Bootstrap proportions were inferred from 100 resampled datasets by using PHYLIP's PAM distance/neighbor joining and protein parsimony methods.",

Briefly, cells at 80% confluency (\u223c1 \u00d7 106 cells/dish) in 35-mm-diameter dishes were infected with the indicated helper virus at a multiplicity of approximately 10 PFU per cell and transfected with 600 ng of pDrep1 transcript in Lipofectin (Invitrogen) at 1 hpi. For passage of progeny virus, supernatant fluids were harvested at 48 hpi and 500 \u03bcl was used to directly infect freshly confluent cells in a 35-mm dish. RNA extracted with Trizol (yielding approximately 10 \u03bcg per plate) was stored at \u221220\u00b0C as an ethanol precipitate. For Northern analysis, precisely one-fourth of the total RNA preparation (approximately 2.5 \u03bcg per lane) was used for electrophoresis in a formaldehyde-agarose gel. Approximately 1 ng of transcript was loaded per lane when used as a size marker. RNA was transferred from the gel to Nytran membrane by vacuum blotting and blots were probed with oligonucleotide TGEV8 5\u2032-end labeled with 32P to specific activities of 1.5 \u00d7 105 to 3.5 \u00d7 105 cpm/pmol (Cerenkov counts). For quantitating viral RNA replication, the blots used earlier for DI RNA detection on which radioactivity was no longer detectible were stripped and probed with 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide 3\u2032UTRPSEV(+), a probe complementary to a common 3\u2032 UTR sequence in all helper viruses (Table 1). Probed blots were read with a Packard InstantImager Autoradiography System for quantitation and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 6 to 48 h at \u221280\u00b0C for imaging. Images were recorded by digital scanning of films.",
