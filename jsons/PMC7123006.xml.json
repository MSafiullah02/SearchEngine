Over this timeframe, and particularly within the past 20 years, the rise of new digital and mobile technologies in terms of sensors, geospatial technologies, advanced analytics, social media, and cell phones, have made the collection and analysis of a wide variety of information, to include different types of biological data, more readily accessible. These developments provide opportunities to think about biodefense preparedness in new and unique ways. Harnessing digital technologies more effectively to better identify and assess emerging biosecurity threats could lead to improved detection, response, and preparedness measures to eliminate or at least mitigate a bioweapons attack. This chapter will discuss the application of \u201cbig data\u201d and \u201cbig data\u201d analytics to biodefense problems in the specific domains of: (1) threat awareness; and (2) surveillance and detection. The chapter will begin by defining \u201cbig data\u201d and biodefense, and then will examine the potential promises and pitfalls in biodefense applications and provide recommendations for the future of \u201cbig data\u201d in addressing biodefense problems.",

[11] discuss that \u201cbig data\u201d includes different categories of data: public data, private data, data exhaust, community data, and data generated through self-quantification. Public data are data typically held by governments, governmental organizations, and local communities and are publically released or available. Private data are data held by private firms, non-profit organizations, governments, and individuals that reflect private information that cannot be easily derived from public sources. Data exhaust refers to data that are passively collected for a different purpose, but can be recombined with other data sources to create new information (e.g., cell phone data or internet searching data). Community data is a distillation of unstructured data\u2014especially text\u2014that capture a variety of social trends, thoughts, and behaviors (e.g., consumer reviews on products). Self-quantification data are types of data that are revealed by the individual through quantifying personal actions and behaviors (e.g., FitBit data). As one can see there are a variety of \u201cbig data\u201d types. \u201cBig data\u201d analytics involve the process of examining \u201cbig data\u201d gathered over multiple time points (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years), using a variety of analytic techniques, developed by unique algorithms. Some examples include text analytics (mining data from different kinds of text based documents and materials), machine learning (the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves to generate new data), predictive analytics (the use of different statistical, modeling, and other quantitative approaches to analyze current data to make predictions about future), and natural language processing (using computer programs to understand human speech as it is written or spoken)\u2014to name only a few.",

Volume refers to working with increasingly larger volumes of data (e.g., terabytes, petabytes, or larger). Variety refers to the ability to make sense of different sources and types of data, including structured forms (e.g., numbers, dates, and groups of words and numbers) and unstructured forms (e.g., text, video, audio, tweets) that can come from a wide variety sources, to include public and privately held sources. This data can consist of information that is solely digital in origin, as well as data that has been subsequently digitized. Velocity refers to the increasing frequency and speed of incoming data that needs to be analyzed, and the speed at which it can be analyzed. Veracity signifies the trustworthiness of the data. It is important to note at the outset that \u201cbig data\u201d is often incomplete, imperfect, and error-prone, and how it is collected and stored in databases and repositories is not necessarily standardized. These shortcomings can make data access and sharing issues difficult\u2014therefore, the use of \u201cbig data\u201d has analytic challenges that are analogous, if not necessarily identical, to other types of data.",

There is potentially a wealth of new information and knowledge that could be learned to improve biodefense using big datasets and technologies. There are, however, also some challenges to consider. Questions are often raised about the veracity of the data (including ways to thwart the collection of accurate data) and problems with the algorithms used by the analytics programs to create and process the data\u2014which are issues that can be difficult for analysts to understand and assess.

The overarching strategy that has set U.S. biodefense policy and programs since 2004 is Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD 10), Biodefense for the 21st Century [12].2 This Presidential Directive described the \u201cessential pillars\u201d of the U.S. national biodefense program as: Threat Awareness, Prevention and Protection, Surveillance and Detection, and Response and Recovery. Threat Awareness involves gathering and analyzing information about potential adversaries and emerging developments in the life sciences and biotechnology that can pose threats. Prevention and Protection involves developing a range of political tools (e.g., arms control, export control, international assistance) to impede adversaries from developing a bioweapons capability and launching an attack, as well as developing technologies and response measures to protect critical infrastructure from a potential attack. Surveillance and Detection is focused on creating early warning and detection technologies and systems to identify and provide attribution of a bioweapons attack. Response and Recovery deals with the various technologies, medical and non-medical countermeasures, policies and plans to enable quick and effective response and recovery in the event of a bioweapons attack. Each of these pillars is designed to work individually and collectively to support different kinds of defensive activities such as identification of emerging state and non-state actor threats, controlling access to dangerous pathogens, identification of suspicious disease outbreaks, protection of critical infrastructure used in biodefense work, and development of medical countermeasures in the event of an attack (See Fig. 15.1).\n",

Laura Tateosian at North Carolina State University is developing a new GIS analytics prototype called GazeGIS that combines natural language processing, eye tracking, and geoparsing to provide users with additional contextual information as they read/process any text displayed on a computer screen [17]. When used in conjunction with eye-tracking hardware, the prototype displays real-time, gaze-contingent geographic data about particular city or country names. Alternatively, a user can hover over these words with a computer mouse to create the same effect if eye-tracking hardware is unavailable. The current prototype is able to provide overview maps, coordinates, and weather information, as well as information derived from Google search results; additional features are being developed. This system could help assist an intelligence analyst in processing a variety of intelligence reports on adversaries developing bioweapons capabilities\u2014as the analyst reads the report, GazeGIS automatically identifies and creates a real-time map of the locations and geographical features identified. These mapped features can provide important contextual information for the text. In doing so, the GazeGIS prototype provides users the ability to have an enhanced real-time immersive experience about different geographical and contextual data while reading text and reports (Fig. 15.2).\n",

The FBI\u2019s investigation included large sets of heterogeneous structured and unstructured data including: 26,000 emails, 4 million megabytes of computer data from 10,000 witness interviews and 5750 grand jury subpoenas, 6000 items seized from Ivins\u2019 home and other locations, the collection of 5730 environmental samples from 60 site locations, medical and psychological reports about Ivins, and microbial forensic data generated from biological samples in Ivan\u2019s laboratory.4 Combining and interpreting these heterogeneous datasets was challenging and took the U.S. government nearly 10 years to complete, and is considered to be one of the most complex investigations undertaken by the FBI.",

For example, Nowviskie and Saathoff describe how now there are suites of new \u201cbig data\u201d analytic tools to assist the investigation that would involve sentiment analysis, authorship attribution, and pattern analysis at scale [21, 22]. Sentiment analysis is the study of opinions, sentiments, and emotions in text that can reveal affect or a psychological state. Although Ivins deleted many of his emails, it was later learned that copies of these messages were saved on his computer system. These messages could have been processed with new sentiment analysis tools to generate new understandings of Ivins mental state and behavior. New authorship attribution algorithms could have been applied to the Bacillus anthracis letter mailings and compared to Ivins\u2019 writing to see if stronger corroboration existed. Also, using data analytics to combine information on Ivins movements, financial transactions, and other data on his life could have revealed particular patterns in his life and work that went unnoticed by investigators at the time, or that only were connected much later in the investigation.",

One could imagine a different outcome had \u201cbig data\u201d analytic approaches been used to help with analysis of the Iraqi data. Although there are several reasons for the intelligence failure (see [23]) and collection on Iraqi data was difficult, there were critical datasets and data integration efforts that were not pursued by intelligence analysts. Richard Kerr, former Deputy Director of the CIA who was tasked to form a team to study the intelligence failures on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, found that there was little intelligence collection on open source social, cultural, political, and economic impacts on Iraq from the nearly 20 years of war and 10 years of sanctions, UN inspections, and international isolation, and no analyses of how the datasets from these impacts might affect the progress of a WMD program ([24], p. 48\u201349, 51). Kerr et al. note that although \u201csofter\u201d intelligence data on Iraqi societal issues, personalities, and elites was available in different databases, they were difficult for U.S. intelligence to access, process, and integrate with classified information. As a result, there was \u201cno attempt to synthesize a broader understanding of Iraq out of the many detailed pieces\u2026.the absence of such a contextual effort contributed to assessments that failed to recognize the significance of gaps in collection that may have been more evident when viewed from a larger perspective\u201d ([24], p. 52). What resulted, then, was a narrow, and ultimately flawed, technical analysis of Iraq\u2019s WMD programs, based on thin classified data that was not corroborated and integrated with other information sources. At the time, if there might have been data mining and data fusion \u201cbig data\u201d analytic tools available for intelligence, the results of that data processing might have produced analyses showing a more measured perspective on Iraq\u2019s WMD capabilities.",

After the open scientific publication of this poliovirus experiment in the journal Science, the U.S. policy community raised concerns about whether terrorists might pick up the experimental methods used in this paper to re-create poliovirus, or other more deadly viruses. Using standard data gathering and analytic methods, it would appear that this synthesis experiment would be replicated by anyone with access to relevant materials and equipment, which are commercially available. However, closer ethnographic study of this case revealed important laboratory know-how that constituted the success of this synthesis experiment. Without this know-how, one would be unable to synthesize poliovirus using the experimental protocol regardless of how many pieces of DNA one might buy, what equipment one has, who one might buy these materials from, or the step-by-step procedure. What I have learned about this experiment is that in spite of a wealth of explicit information and readily available materials out in the public domain, critical portions of making this experiment work remain craft-like techniques that involve quite a bit of specialized, localized know-how that is difficult to transfer to other laboratories or contexts.",

As sociologists of science Nigel Gilbert and Michael Mulkay have long noted, the public and private accounts of science are very different; only the private discourse reflects the varied, contingent, and messy character that constitutes the social character of scientific work [26]. As a result, scientific publications, presentations, and other formal means of codified scientific knowledge that are readily accessible through many \u201cbig data\u201d approaches do not tell the whole story.

Participatory syndromic data are crowd-sourced data in which volunteers self-report their symptoms. This data does not provide confirmation of disease attributed to specific pathogens but does provide individual-level health data in near real time. Finally, non-health digital data are data gathered from the use of Internet search engines, social media, or mobile phones. They involve data on health-related behavior, including location and travel patterns, which can provide additional details about potential disease transmission. A 2016 National Academies of Science workshop noted that other kinds of structured and unstructured non-health electronic data sources, such as data from school attendance records, veterinary clinics, pharmaceutics sales, global transportation patterns, and climate could also be combined with other types of individual and community-level medical information to yield a more holistic picture of health in a specific area that would enable early warning or alert systems of a disease outbreak ideally weeks or months in advance ([30], p. 5).",

By aggregating Google search queries, GFT attempted to make accurate predictions about influenza activity in 29 countries to help localities and countries reduce the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza (e.g., increasing vaccinations and supplies of antiviral drugs, issuing information about infection control measures, advocating school or other public closings) [33].

Lazer et al. [36] investigated these failures and found there was a persistent pattern of GFT performing well for 2\u20133 years, and then failing significantly; overall, GFT appeared to perform worse over time. These failures were attributed to several reasons. First, there were inherent problems with Google\u2019s GFT algorithm, which was quite vulnerable to overfitting. For example, the algorithm was fitting unrelated terms like \u201chigh school basketball\u201d to influenza or to different health conditions. With millions of search terms being fit to the CDC\u2019s data, many of which were unlikely to be related to actual influenza cases, one can imagine how this led to problems in the accuracy of influenza predictions. Similar to the GFT errors, in one other well-known example of \u201cbig data\u201d gone wrong, Leinweber [38] demonstrated that data mining techniques could show a strong but spurious correlation between the changes in the S&P 500 stock index and butter production in Bangladesh.

Also Crawford and Finne noted that social media data is not always representative of a local population. For example, Twitter tends to be used by younger, wealthy, and more urban adult populations, meaning that infants, older, rural, and more marginalized populations may not be represented by Twitter posts ([28], p. S377). Also, most social media data lacks demographic information, such as age and sex, which is usually important in epidemiological studies. All of these factors could be a significant shortcoming for response planning in a bioweapons attack given that infants/children, older, rural, and more marginalized/developing country populations might be excluded from social media datasets and those populations are typically more vulnerable and could be significantly harmed by a bioweapons attack.",

Also, users can also shape/disguise their online identities and create false information [16, 43, p. 40\u201341]. This misinformation could be used to hide covert bioweapons activities or redirect public health attention in other directions. One can imagine that in the event of a possible bioweapons attack, a key question will be whether social media information represents real data, manipulated data, or artificial bot-generated data. The problem of fake information is not a new development\u2014there have long been efforts to create fake stories about bioweapons. In their book on the Soviet biological weapons program, Leitenberg et al. [44] reveal a disturbing US covert deception and disinformation campaign that operated from the late 1960s through the early 1970s. This program was directed at misleading the Soviet Union regarding the objectives of the US offensive bioweapons program and to suggest that a covert US bioweapons program existed even after the United States had unilaterally renounced its biological weapons program in 1969, leading the Soviets to invest time and money on a response. This deception program was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance of the US Army, and used a double agent to convey false information to the Soviets. The authors found that the Central Intelligence Agency, years later, debated whether this campaign might have contributed to the Soviet decision to violate the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and move its weapons activities underground, or at least provided political cover to justify the decision to increase its biological weapons program. Such disinformation campaigns arguable are easier to conduct in the internet age. Therefore, it is important to remember that \u201cbig data\u201d approaches do not remove the problem of disinformation, but, in many cases, may make it more problematic.",

This chapter has also highlighted some of the pitfalls of relying on \u201cbig data\u201d approaches without considering the limitations of such data, and how \u201cbig data\u201d approaches can obscure or ignore other important information for analysis. Although there are many public pronouncements that \u201cbig data\u201d analytics will soon replace human assessments, a more realistic and useful understanding would be to see \u201cbig data\u201d approaches as one of several tools that be brought to bear on biodefense efforts. Rather than replace traditional efforts, Lazer et al. [36] have argued that we will likely see more \u201chybrid\u201d systems that integrate \u201cbig data\u201d with traditional data analysis. In doing so, the real analytic innovation will be using data from all sources, to include traditional public health data, coupled to social science, environmental, contextual, and ethnographic data, and otherwise, \u201csmall data\u201d, with \u201cbig data\u201d [27, 36, 45\u201350]. In this way, the biases and short-comings of each method can be used to balance each other to arrive at a more accurate picture of a disease outbreak or bioweapons attack. Lazar et al. argued that the real data revolution, then, will be, \u201cusing data from all traditional and new sources, and providing a deeper, clearer understanding of our world\u201d [47]. This kind of data analysis will also require new kinds of multi-disciplinary analytic teams, who possess relevant subject matter expertise and understand long term trends and patterns [51], to be created and work together on these problems. To date, multi-method, multi-platform research studies are rare [52, 53], particularly in biodefense, but the payoff would be significant.",
