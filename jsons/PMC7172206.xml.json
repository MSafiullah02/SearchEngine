Bats are important reservoirs of many emerging deadly viral pathogens, such as filoviruses, lyssaviruses, and SARS-related coronaviruses (Calisher et al., 2006). Genetically divergent bat-borne hantaviruses have recently been identified in Africa (Weiss et al., 2012, Sumibcay et al., 2012) and Asia (Guo et al., 2013, Zhang, 2014, Gu et al., 2014), but very limited sequences are available, with none having complete sequences of all three gene segments (Table 1\n). Lack of complete genomic sequences impairs the phylogenetic and evolutionary comparison of bat-borne hantaviruses with those of human, rodents and insectivores.

The bat species was morphologically identified by an experienced zoologist and further confirmed by PCR of its mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequence (Wang et al., 2003). Intestines with contents, and lungs were collected and the samples of each tissue were pooled for viral metagenomic analysis as described elsewhere (He et al., 2013b). Among sequences annotated to mammal viruses, 250 identical reads with an average length of 135 nucleotides (nt) were found to exhibit 70% nt identity with the S gene of Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus (DOBV) (Nemirov et al., 1999). To further screen for hantaviruses, total RNA was extracted from each sample using a QIAamp RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), then subjected to hantavirus-specific RT-PCR using published primers (Klempa et al., 2006). Hantavirus was identified in one bat lung tissue, and designated Laibin virus (LBV).",

            "text": "To obtain the full genome of LBV, primers were designed according to bat-borne hantavirus sequences retrieved from GenBank (Table S). The end sequences of each segment were obtained by using conserved terminal nt sequences as primers. Overlapping amplicons were obtained by using a Fast HiFidelity PCR Kit (Tiangen), then assembled into three full gene segments. The complete sequences of S, M and L gene segments were 1,935, 3,908 and 6,531 nt in length, encoding 427, 1,127 and 2,145 aa proteins respectively (GenBank accession numbers: KM102247 and KM102249). Notably, LBV exhibited the longest M segment, 107 nt longer in the 3\u2032 non-coding region than the largest M segment previously reported (3,801 nt; El Moro Canyon hantavirus RM-97, accession number U26828). The three segments were aligned with reported sequences using Clustal W (Version 2.0). Since most of the bat-borne hantavirus sequences were incomplete (Table 1), phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on partial sequences of the three gene segments (Fig. 1\n). The resulting topologies were similar to that described previously (Guo et al., 2013), which divided all sequences into four clades, and all bat-borne hantaviruses were clustered together. Further sequence comparison showed that the three gene segments of LBV had 46.4\u201375.3% nucleotide identity with other bat-borne hantaviruses (Table 1) and 44.6\u201367.4% with hantaviruses from humans, rats, mice, shrews and moles (Table 2\n). These results characterize LBV as being a novel bat-borne hantavirus exhibiting highest nucleotide identities with the three gene segments of Vietnamese XSV (60.8\u201375.3%) (Table 1).",

In present study a novel bat-borne hantavirus has been identified and its full genomic sequence has been determined. Comparison with available sequences shows that LBV is distantly related to all known bat-borne hantaviruses (Table 1), but that it is closer to Vietnamese XSV (60.8\u201375.3% nt identity) than to the two other Chinese strains LQUV and HUPV. Laibin city, however, is closer to Vietnamese Tuy\u00ean Quang province (the isolation site of XSV near the China-Vietnam border) than to Longquan city in Zhejiang province (LQUV) and Huangpi city in Hubei province (HUPV). Insufficient sequence data prevents a comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversities of the bat-borne hantaviruses from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone, but partial sequence analysis suggests that bat-borne hantaviruses have evolved worldwide within an independent and diverse phylogroup (Fig. 1). The successful determination of the complete sequences of the LBV gene segments may provide reference data for determining the complete genomic sequences of other bat-borne hantaviruses.",
