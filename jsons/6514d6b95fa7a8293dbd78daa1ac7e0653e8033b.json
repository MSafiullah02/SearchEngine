Conversely, a large amount of experimental studies and some randomized clinical trials showed the benefits of the n-3 PUFA administration in the context of ALI because of their anti-inflammatory properties. Based on these data, several scientific societies recommended in their guidelines, with an A or B grade of recommendation, the use of n-3 PUFAs in ALI/ARDS patients. However, at present, the issue of lipid therapy in ALI/ARDS is still controversial due, at least in part, to inconclusive or contradicting results in several recent clinical trials using n-3 PUFAs.

In ARDS early phase, the alveolar space is the site of significant inflammatory reactions (Pugin et al. 1999) .

However, recent theories suggest that it is not the neutrophil and macrophage number but their The normal alveolus and the alveolus in acute lung injury. Neutrophil is shown migrating through a gap in the capillary endothelium into the alveolar space (activated neutrophil). In the alveolar space, an alveolar macrophage is secreting cytokines: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. The alveolar type I cells are damaged or necrotic, while alveolar type II cells are intact and release cytokines. The tissue architecture is disrupted with the formation of hyaline membranes on the denuded basement membrane. The alveolar space is filled by protein-rich edema fluid Fig. 2 Alveolar damage in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The tissue architecture is disrupted, alveoli are collapsed, alveolar type II (ATII) cells are hyperplastic, and alveolar type I cells are necrotic.

The first RCT analyzed the effect of an enteral n-3 PUFA-enriched diet in septic patients with ALI or ARDS showing that the administration of the study formula, compared to a control formula with less lipids than in the previous three studies, was associated to a shorter ICU-LOS but not to an improvement in gas exchange or in a lower incidence of novel organ failures (Grau-Carmona et al. 2011) . A phase 2 placebocontrolled RCT in ALI patients investigating an enteral administration of fish oil for up to 14 days did not demonstrate a decrease in cytokine or other inflammatory marker concentrations both in BAL fluid from baseline to day 4 or 8 and in plasma, as well as a decrease in ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, organ failure score, or 60-day mortality (Stapleton et al. 2011 ). The last RCT tested the effects of enteral feeding with n-3 PUFAs, \u03b3-linolenic acid, and antioxidants on clinical outcomes in ALI patients in a phase 3 trial (OMEGA trial) using a twice-daily bolus administration (Rice et al. 2011) . Contrary to all other RCTs, the authors reported that enteral administration of this formula was associated to significantly fewer ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, and non-pulmonary organ failure-free days, as well as more days with diarrhea. The trial was stopped early for futility at the first interim analysis. The interpretation of the OMEGA trial presents some difficulties (Lev and Singer 2013) . Firstly, it was used a different approach of twicedaily bolus administration of enteral formulas instead of continuous enteral infusion. Secondly, the enteral diets administered to the study group (i.e., megadoses of n-3 PUFAs and lower protein content) and to the control group (i.e., higher protein and carbohydrate content) are notably different from those used in the first three RCTs.",

In a second trial, patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis were randomized into two groups to receive an intravenous lipid emulsion enriched or not in fish oil (Barbosa et al. 2010) . The authors reported that the PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio at day 6 was significantly higher and plasma IL-6 concentration significantly decreased in the group treated with fish oil; however, fish oil administration did not improve the length of ventilation or ICU-LOS and mortality. The last RCT investigated the effects of an intravenous administration of n-3 PUFAs with the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio of 1:2 as supplementation of EN for 14 days in ARDS patients finding that fish oil administration alone did not improve ventilation, ICU-LOS, or survival (Gupta et al. 2011 ).",
