            "text": "JAMA recently published an article \"Fixing the parent trap for resident physicians\". 32. 57 This article recounted how Michael Gisondi, MD, vice chair of education in the 58 Department of Emergency Medicine at Stanford University's School of Medicine 59 established the following new rules for new parent residents:601) The new parent resident could choose to\" forgo overnight shifts, 61 unscheduled call, or having more than 3 shifts in a row for 6 weeks after62 returning from parental leave\". 32 63 2) \"For 4 weeks before estimated delivery date, pregnant residents are 64 exempt from overnight shifts, unscheduled call, and more than 3 shifts in a 65 row.\" 32 66 3) \"This policy also covers parental leave, lactation, and a comprehensive list 67 of other resources for new parents\". 32 68 69 In my opinion, program directors (PD) and Chairs in dermatology have failed to 70 adequately address the issue of new parent residents despite the following undisputable 71 facts: 72 1) Dermatology residents are now more than 64% women 43 73 74 2) Maternity leave creates increased workload for those residents not on leave 75 which often creates some resentment 54 76 3) Previous survey-based studies have highlighted a perception of hostility toward 77 female trainees during their pregnancy from faculty. In 1978 and 1981, when I gave birth to my children as an Ackerman dermatopathology 82 fellow and then young attending at UCONN, I was offered zero maternity leave. In 1978, 83 after giving birth to our son, I took off only my allocated 4 weeks of vacation thereby 84 have no additional time off during the rest of my 18-month fellowship. Three years later, 85 in 1981, I gave birth to our daughter at 2AM, was required to see an in-patient 86 consultation at 7 AM which I did in my hospital gown and subsequently signed out my 87 dermatopathology slides that same day; my dermatopathology staff wheeled my 88 microscope to my hospital room in the maternity ward. 109 . A few weeks after my 89 daughter was born, I happened to pass the Dean of the School of Medicine in the 90 hospital lobby. He stopped me and asked me: \"You're not going to have any more 91 children, are you?\" to which I answered: \"What do you care? I did not take a minute off 92 from work!\" 93 94 Although we have come a long way, we have not come far enough! To level the playing 95 fields for men and women in our profession, it is time to address the issue of pregnancy 96 and maternity leave. Policies for our residents and fellows who plan to have a child 97 during training remain confusing and variable from institution to institution. In my 98 opinion, it is time for there to be a national agreed upon policy. A relatively recent 2018 99 study showed that less than half of graduate medical education (GME) programs at 12 100 top medical education programs (including Columbia, Duke, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, 101 University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, University 102 of California San Francisco, Stanford, University of Washington, Washington University 103 in St Louis, and Yale) had paid childbearing or family leave policies for residents despite 104 having them in place for faculty. 110 105 106 A survey sent exclusively to 8,000 female residents at a large medical center queried 107 these women on their experiences with maternity leave and the subsequent impact on 108 their well-being. 121. The average maternity leave was reported to be 8.4 weeks (which 109 was made up of 6 weeks of maternity plus vacation time plus sick time). Many women 110 reported only taking 6 weeks off that they cobbled together from vacation time and sick 111 time. 11,12 , 10",
