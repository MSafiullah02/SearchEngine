Vaccination is effective against many bacteria, viruses, parasites and other infectious diseases in humans. Genetically engineered live vaccine (GELV) is an effective method for vaccine delivery. Non-pathogenic microorganisms are usually used as carriers. The recombinant protective antigen gene fragments of germs are restructured in the vector microbes, and the microbes expressing protective antigens are used as vaccines. Vaccinia virus, adenovirus, and poliovirus are commonly used viral vectors. Salmonella and Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) are commonly used bacterial vectors (Detmer and Glenting 2006). The potential for reversion of attenuated strains to virulence is a significant safety concern. Using non-pathogenic bacteria, especially probiotics, as vaccine carriers enhances the safety of vaccines.",

None of the nine colonies resulted in the formation of a 1440 bp DNA band by colony PCR using primers yz1 and yz2. This result indicates that plasmid 1 in strains 1\u20139 may be eliminated. Strains 5 and 9 were randomly selected for further investigation. By using novobiocin for plasmid elimination, another nine colonies were selected and designated as strains A to I. A distinct 1440 bp DNA band was obtained using primers yz1 and yz2 in seven of the nine colonies, except for strains A and F. Strains 5, 9, A, and F were cultured in MRS broth for 24 h. Genomic DNAs were isolated and used as templates for PCR with primers yz3 and yz4. The results are shown in Fig. 1\n. No DNA band was obtained in strain 5, and 600 bp DNA bands were obtained in strains 9, A, F, and L. casei ATCC 334 (control). These results indicate that strain 5 was most likely the plasmid-eliminated strain, thus it was used for further investigation.",

The strain was isolated from a well-known and highly regarded as safe food, Emmental cheese. L. casei ATCC 334 is a well-studied, commercially available genome-sequenced strain (Makarova et al. 2006). Therefore, L. casei ATCC 334 has the potential to be a qualified carrier of vaccines. However, plasmid-free strains, such as L. casei ATCC 393, are usually used as transformation hosts (Table 3). Meanwhile, L. casei ATCC 334 harbors a 29,061 bp plasmid (Makarova et al. 2006), which may affect the replication, stability, and transferability of exogenous plasmids. Hence, the use of strain ATCC 334 in oral vaccine construction is limited. To overcome this problem, the current study applied plasmid elimination to obtain a food-grade derivative of strain ATCC 334. The stability of the plasmid-cured derivative L. casei Q-5 was verified by detecting plasmid recovery using PCR methods. We also examined the normal growth ability of L. casei Q-5 in MRS medium, and no obvious decrease was detected. Therefore, a safe, stable, and plasmid-free strain, L. casei Q-5, was constructed to be the host of the food-grade expression system.",
