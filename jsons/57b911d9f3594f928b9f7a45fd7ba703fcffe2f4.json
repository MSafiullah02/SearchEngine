This algorithm is a not only pragmatic but also evidence based and should reduce the risk of negative laparoscopy/laparotomy in this group of patients. I hope this view is shared by the wider bariatric community and is endorsed as a modified management algorithm for patients suspected of internal hernia in the current times. Once again, many thanks for bringing this to the attention of the bariatric community.",
