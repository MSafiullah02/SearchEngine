The occurrence of post\u2010transplant pneumonia adversely impacts both graft and recipient survival, as well as the cost of care for SOT recipients.1 Numerous micro\u2010organisms can cause pneumonia in the SOT recipient with some etiologies resulting in self\u2010limited infection and others causing significant morbidity and mortality. As a result of the varied clinical presentations and etiologies of pneumonia in SOT recipients, arriving at a specific microbiologic diagnosis can be challenging but is important for optimal care, especially with complicated or refractory pneumonias. In this section, the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, diagnostic testing, and empiric antimicrobial treatment of pneumonia in SOT recipients are reviewed.

While some specific diagnostic tests have been evaluated more systematically, individual test performance is often defined in healthy subjects or in groups of subjects with a variety of immunocompromising conditions. Therefore, the appropriate diagnostic evaluation for pneumonia in SOT recipients should be highly individualized based on local epidemiology, locally available tests, and practice parameters, as well as patient\u2010specific risk factors, exposures, and medical history. Guidelines for diagnosis of pneumonia by other groups can also be informative though do not always specifically apply to the SOT recipient.75, 76, 77, 78 A tiered approach to the diagnostic evaluation of pneumonia encompasses an initial approach, followed by a more extensive evaluation if the diagnosis remains unclear or if the patient is deteriorating. If the clinical situation is critical or if a more specific diagnosis is initially suspected, respective tests are applied and the order of diagnostic tests modified. One potential diagnostic approach to pneumonia in the SOT recipient is outlined in Figure 1.\nThe diagnostic evaluation of SOT recipients with suspected or confirmed pneumonia should be performed using a tiered approach with the pace and extent of evaluation informed by the severity and acuity of presentation, the degree of immunosuppression, and the patient's risk factor/exposure history (strong, low).We recommend against using current pneumonia severity scores in SOT recipients with pneumonia (strong, very low). Pneumonia severity scores have been evaluated in non\u2010transplant patients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia and have variable ability to stratify for severity and clinical outcome.79 No studies of pneumonia severity scoring systems have been performed in SOT recipients though the PSI and CURB\u201065 scores had poor performance characteristics in cancer patients presenting with pneumonia.80\nPractitioners evaluating SOT recipients with symptoms or signs of pneumonia should assess the following at initial evaluation:\n\u0366Key features of the patient's medical, transplant, immunization, and social histories (strong, moderate).\u0366Current and prior microbial colonization and current and prior antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens (strong, moderate).\u0366Social history for exposure(s) which would suggest risk of untreated latent infection such as latent TB infection, coccidioidomycosis, and strongyloidiasis (strong, moderate).\u0366The acuity of the patient's clinical presentation and use of this information in guiding the differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and empiric antimicrobial therapy (strong, low).The need for contact or respiratory isolation should be assessed and acted upon early in the patient evaluation to avoid exposure of other SOT recipients, patients, and/or staff to potentially contagious pathogens (strong, high).81\nLocal epidemiology of respiratory viruses, and in particular influenza virus, should be reviewed and considered in the evaluation (strong, high).54\n\n",

The utility of BAL in SOT recipients with pneumonia, lung infiltrates, or lung nodules has been evaluated in several small series.5, 22, 68, 101, 102 Microbiologic yield for BAL in these studies ranges from 39% to 77%, with the highest yields in patients with nosocomial pneumonia,5 and those with onset of symptoms between 1 and 6 months post\u2010transplant.102 Importantly, microbiologic yield is clearly influenced by the pre\u2010test probability of infection and the relative incidence of infections in distinct populations.102, 103 BAL studies listed in Figure 1 are proposed as a complete list of diagnostic options. While extensive, performance of the complete list of these studies may not be needed in all SOT recipients with pneumonia.\nWe recommend the performance of BAL in the setting of diffuse or focal pulmonary infiltrate in patients with failure to improve on empiric antibacterial therapy in whom diagnosis has not been reached by non\u2010invasive testing (strong, moderate). The decision to proceed with BAL versus lung biopsy for initial invasive testing must be highly individualized for each patient and is dependent on the clinician's risk/benefit analysis.We recommend the following studies as a complete BAL fluid evaluation with modifications as needed depending on an individual patient's clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and clinical course (Figure 1):\n\u0366Traditional bacterial, fungal, viral, and mycobacterial culture (see Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Endemic Fungi, Emerging Fungi, CMV, HSV, VZV, Respiratory Viruses, Non\u2010tuberculous Mycobacterial, Tuberculosis, and Nocardia sections of 4th edition of AST ID Guidelines) (strong, moderate).\u0366Diagnostic testing including PJP\u2010directed stains or nucleic acid\u2010based testing for PJP from BAL fluid (strong, high), in particular in patients either no longer receiving prophylaxis or on non\u2010TMP\u2010SMX prophylaxis (see Pneumocystis section of 4th edition of AST ID Guidelines).\u0366Fungal\u2010directed stains in patients with radiographic findings suggestive of invasive fungal infection (strong, low).\u0366Galactomannan in patients with radiographic findings suggestive of invasive fungal infection (weak, low).97, 104\n\u0366Antigen\u2010based testing for endemic fungal infections such as Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, and Paracoccidioides for patients with a compatible clinical history and geographic exposure risk (strong, low).\u0366Nucleic acid\u2010based testing (PCR, QNAT, Film array) testing for the following pathogens depending on test availability and on the patient's clinical history, exposure risk, and radiographic findings (strong, low):\u25aaRespiratory viruses\u25aaCMV\u25aa\nMycoplasma spp, Ureaplasma spp, and/or Legionella spp\u25aa\nNocardia spp\u25aaInvasive mold species\u25aa\nMycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\n",

Complications were frequent (28.7% of OLBs) and associated with higher mortality rate.105 A similar study comparing SOT and non\u2010SOT patients with diffuse lung disease demonstrated a therapeutic management change frequency of 33%.106 Percutaneous CT\u2010guided lung biopsy has been evaluated in one series of SOT recipients with parenchymal lung nodule(s).107 Diagnostic yield in this series of 45 biopsies was 53% with the most frequent diagnoses being fungal disease and malignancy.

Consideration can be given to close follow\u2010up with serial imaging prior to performance of invasive diagnostic procedures for cases in which the risk for malignancy and/or invasive fungal infection is felt to be low (weak, low).In patients who live in geographic areas that impart risk for endemic fungal infection and who have exposure history suggestive of a moderate to high risk for endemic fungal infection, we recommend deferral of lung biopsy until after antigen/serologic assessment for endemic fungal infection is complete (weak, low).\n",

            "text": "Given the complex and varied nature of specific treatment for individual pathogens that cause pneumonia in the SOT recipient, this section will address recommendations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in this setting. Various factors significantly impact empiric antimicrobial regimens for pneumonia in the SOT recipient. The degree of immunosuppression and pace of illness onset (acute, subacute, chronic) are significant determinants in the breadth of empiric antimicrobial therapy provided to an individual patient. Except during influenza season, where empiric therapy may include an agent directed against influenza, antibacterial therapy is the cornerstone of the initial empiric therapy for pneumonia in the SOT recipient.108 Empiric antifungal chemotherapy is rarely initiated early, except in instances where the clinical and radiological presentation strongly suggests a fungal origin. The choice of the initial therapy will depend on the following considerations:\nEmpiric treatment regimens for pneumonia in the SOT recipient should take into account each individual patient's known microbial colonization as well as prior antimicrobial resistance patterns of specific colonizing or pathogenic organisms with special emphasis on multi\u2010drug resistant bacteria colonizing the airway in lung transplant recipients (strong, low).During influenza season, empiric administration of an antiviral drug active against influenza is recommended in SOT recipients with influenza\u2010like illness, including pneumonia, while awaiting results of influenza\u2010specific testing unless there is access to PCR\u2010based detection methods with rapid turnaround time (strong, moderate)54, 83 (See RNA Respiratory Viruses section of 4th edition of AST ID Guidelines).In a stable patient considered suitable for outpatient therapy who is at lower risk for opportunistic or hospital\u2010acquired infection and in whom no specific pathogen is suspected, empiric therapy should cover community\u2010acquired pneumonia and should follow national/international guidelines influenced by local resistance and prevalence patterns (strong, low). Beta\u2010lactams or fluoroquinolones (FQ) with coverage of respiratory pathogens may be considered for empiric therapy in this setting (strong, low). Practitioners should consider the role of drug interactions, adverse reactions, and increasing antimicrobial resistance when considering risks and benefits for the FQ use in SOT recipients.Consideration should be given to empiric coverage of intracellular pathogens (such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Legionella spp) in SOT recipients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia (weak, low) with greater consideration given to empiric intracellular pathogen treatment of pediatric SOT recipients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia (strong, moderate).13, 14 One important consideration is the selection and use of empiric therapy in this setting in which drug\u2010drug interactions are present between macrolides and immunosuppressive agents. Respiratory fluoroquinolones may be considered in settings with a high incidence of macrolide resistance for Mycoplasma spp with consideration given to the above\u2010noted issues in considering risk and benefit of FQ use (weak, low).With outpatient regimens discussed above, the inclusion of antibiotic therapy against methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas spp is dependent on local resistance patterns, prevalence, the individual patient's infection, and bacterial colonization history, as well as the features of the presenting illness (eg, radiographic evidence of lung abscess) (strong, low) (see MRSA and MDR GNR sections of 4th edition of AST ID Guidelines).In SOT recipients who require hospitalization for pneumonia, combination therapy with a beta\u2010lactam agent (\u00b1MRSA and \u00b1antipseudomonal activity) and an agent active against intracellular organisms (Mycoplasma spp in children and Legionella spp in adults) is recommended (strong, low). The breadth of coverage of the penicillin\u2010based agent used depends on local resistance patterns (especially for S pneumoniae) and whether a nosocomial approach is warranted to cover hospital\u2010acquired gram\u2010negative pathogens (eg, recent hospitalization, underlying chronic or bronchiectatic lung disease, or the presence prosthetic material). Fluoroquinolones are an alternative in this setting (strong, low). For hospitalized patients with nosocomial or ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia, international/national guidelines apply with attention to local guidelines, prevalence, and epidemiology (strong, moderate).\n",

            "text": "Any empiric therapy must be adapted to new clinical and microbiological findings. As appropriateness of initial empiric therapy is measured in large part by the patient's clinical response, close monitoring including repeated clinical evaluation is a prerequisite for any outpatient approach. If this is not feasible or if any doubts prevail, inpatient management should be favored. Furthermore, with any empiric therapy for pneumonia, key gaps in antimicrobial coverage must be kept in mind. Most empiric regimens will not optimally treat Nocardia spp or Pneumocystis jirovecii. Mycobacterial infections may be partially mitigated by the activity of drugs used for empiric pneumonia therapy (eg, imipenem, quinolones, and oxazolidinones). In addition, empiric antibacterial regimens will clearly not provide coverage against invasive, opportunistic, and/or endemic fungal infections. Clinicians caring for SOT recipients with subacute or chronic illness presentations which include pneumonia should consider pathogens such as Nocardia, tuberculosis, non\u2010tuberculous mycobacteria, endemic fungi, and invasive molds. These pathogens require bronchoalveolar fluid or tissue testing for diagnosis and their treatment entails prolonged courses of antimicrobial regimens. Empiric therapy is usually not instituted prior to diagnostic testing or procedure. However, in unique situations of high acuity or inability to perform diagnostic procedures, empiric therapy for these pathogens may be needed.",
