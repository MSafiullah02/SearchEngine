Although these model organisms share some tumour suppressor mechanisms with humans, emerging evidence suggests that long-lived mammals have evolved unique and robust anti-cancer strategies2. For example, genome and transcriptome analyses of the bowhead whale, a large and long-lived mammal with a low rate of cancer, revealed a positive evolutionary selection of the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) gene and duplication of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene, both DNA repair genes3. These data imply that an enhanced DNA repair pathway might protect whales from cancer by lowering the mutation frequency. Genomic analysis of elephants, which also have a low cancer incidence, uncovered a high number of TP53 pseudogenes, and elephant cells displayed an enhanced TP53-dependent DNA damage response compared to human cells4,5.",

They are the second largest order of mammals in the world11, the only mammal capable of powered-wing flight, and an asymptomatic reservoir for many deadly viruses10. Their longevity data predominately come from field-based studies, and therefore, their true longevities may be underestimated, and they may live longer than these reported records12\u201314. In general, longevity is positively correlated with the body size12,13. Austad and Fischer13 defined the longevity quotient (LQ) which takes the consideration of body mass in the estimated maximum lifespan of individual mammalian species. Bats possess one of the highest LQ value among the mammal order12,13, indicating that bats live much longer than other mammals of equivalent size. Their higher LQ makes bats interesting species to study since they may have unique tumour suppressive mechanisms compared to humans. Only a handful of cases of tumours have been recorded to date for bats in captivity15\u201317. However, the underlying mechanisms of tumour suppression in bats are still not fully understood. To understand such mechanisms, we previously performed genomic analyses of Pteropus alecto\n(P. alecto) and Myotis davidii, and discovered that the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway of bats had undergone positive evolutionary selection18. The DDR pathway is the major mechanism that detects and repairs damaged DNA and highly conserved in a diverse range of organisms19. DNA damage can induce cancer via multiple mechanisms, including genomic instability, inactivation of tumour suppressors or activation of oncogenes20. Living organisms are constantly exposed to environmental xenobiotics and internal metabolic by-products, some of which can possess genotoxic properties that can lead to DNA damage21,22. Elucidating whether and how bats efficiently resist DNA damage will advance our understanding of cancer biology.",

We found that cells exposed to \u03b3-irradiation displayed \u03b3H2AX foci rather than pan-nuclear accumulation (Supplementary Fig. 1B), consistent with DSBs. To further confirm these results, we detected the DNA repair protein p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) by immunofluorescence. 53BP1 is recruited to DSBs to facilitate non-homologous end-joining repair and is released upon repair26,27. We observed an increase in the number of 53BP1 foci in PaLung and WI-38 cells exposed to \u03b3-irradiation, which reduced gradually and similarly over time (Fig. 1b). On the other hand, the number of 53BP1 foci increased slowly in \u03b3-irradiated MEFs and remained high at least 12 h after irradiation (Fig. 1b), consistent with a previous report about DNA repair28. Together, these results suggest that lung fibroblasts from P. alecto and human are similarly sensitive and responsive to DNA damage induced by ionising radiation, whereas MEFs display a slightly slower response to the same treatment.",

The amount of intracellular doxorubicin was normalised to the cellular volume since there was some variation of the cell size among the cell lines (Fig. 2d). We found that the amount of doxorubicin within PaLung cells was significantly lower than that within WI-38 and MEF cells, at all the treatment concentrations (Fig. 2e) and times (Fig. 2f).

            "text": "Intracellular drug concentrations are influenced by the balance of drug influx and efflux. ABC transporters are the primary transporters that efflux genotoxic substances, thereby reducing intracellular xenobiotic concentrations32. To determine if ABC transporters contribute to the difference in doxorubicin accumulation between bat, human and mouse cells, we used verapamil (Vera) to inhibit efflux via ABC transporters32, and assessed doxorubicin accumulation by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Specifically, we pre-treated cells with or without verapamil for 30 min, added doxorubicin for 3 h and measured intracellular doxorubicin levels. No notable differences were observed in the doxorubicin fluorescence intensities between control and verapamil-pre-treated WI-38 cells (Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that WI-38 cells exhibit no endogenous drug efflux capability via ABC transporters. Similarly, no obvious differences were detected in doxorubicin accumulation between control and verapamil-pre-treated MEF cells (Fig. 3a, b) and HEK293T cells (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3). In contrast, verapamil-pre-treatment increased doxorubicin fluorescence in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3). Likewise, pre-treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA), another ABC transporter inhibitor32, also led to an increase in doxorubicin fluorescence in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells, but not in WI-38, HEK293T, and MEF cells (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that the drug efflux activity of ABC transporters is required to reduce doxorubicin accumulation in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells. Furthermore, primary P. alecto cell lines derived from kidney (PaKidney), spleen (PaSpleen), brain (PaBrain), and bone marrow (PaMarrow) also displayed a similar increase in doxorubicin accumulation with verapamil pre-treatment (Fig. 3c). Together, these results suggest that cells derived from multiple tissues of P. alecto possess drug efflux activity via ABC transporters.",

            "text": "We hypothesised that ABC transporter activity underlies the increased resistance of bat cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. This hypothesis predicts that pre-treatment with inhibitors of ABC transporters will increase the genotoxic effects of doxorubicin in P. alecto cells but not in WI-38, HEK293T and MEF cells, which lack substantial ABC transporter activity. Indeed, verapamil pre-treatment enhanced the induction of \u03b3H2AX levels by low dose of doxorubicin (1 \u00b5M) in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells, but not in WI-38, HEK293T and MEF cells (Fig. 4a, lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6), confirming that the ABC transporter activity helps to prevent DNA damage in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells. Treating PaLung and PaKiT03 cells with higher doses (5 and 10 \u00b5M) of doxorubicin in the presence of verapamil led to a doxorubicin dose-dependent decrease in \u03b3H2AX levels (Fig. 4a, lanes 6\u20138), as observed in WI-38, HEK293T and MEF cells with or without verapamil pre-treatment, and consistent with histone eviction30 (Fig. 4a, lanes 2\u20134 and 6\u20138). Similar results were obtained with the ABC transporter inhibitor CSA (Fig. 4b) and with cells derived from different tissues of P. alecto (Fig. 4c). Together, these results demonstrate that broad and efficient drug efflux in P. alecto cells contributes to reducing doxorubicin-mediated genotoxicity.",

We identified three highly expressed ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2) that are well-characterised for doxorubicin efflux (Fig. 5a)32,34. To determine if one of these transporters is required for doxorubicin efflux in P. alecto cells, we reduced the expression of each gene in PaKiT03 cells via small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown (Fig. 5b) and examined the effects on intracellular doxorubicin accumulation by flow cytometry (Fig. 5c). Verapamil was used as a positive control for efflux inhibition. We found that only ABCB1 knockdown increased doxorubicin accumulation to a similar extent as verapamil pre-treatment, suggesting that ABCB1 is the transporter responsible for doxorubicin efflux in P. alecto-derived cells.",

ABCB1, also known as the transmembrane protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), is one of the best-characterised efflux transporters and is highly conserved across mammals37. In mammals, ABCB1 is specifically expressed in regions of detoxification, excretion, and protective barriers such as the intestinal epithelium, lumens of the liver, proximal tubule of the kidney as well as blood-tissue barriers of the brain. In rodents, the ABCB1 gene encodes two isoforms, Abcb1a (Mdr1a) and Abcb1b (Mdr1b). Mice deleted for Abcb1a alone or both Abcb1a and Abcb1b are viable and not cancer-prone in laboratory conditions, which are free from genotoxic substances. However, they are more sensitive to toxins than wild-type mice38,39. We found that P. alecto expresses ABCB1 relatively highly and in additional tissues compared to human, such as lung and spleen. The broad expression of ABCB1 may contribute to more efficient protection from genotoxic substances in their environment.",

This broad chemoresistance is achieved by the promiscuous substrate specificity of ABCB1. Cancer cells acquire ABCB1 overexpression after prolonged chemotherapy, which is one of the major causes of cancer relapse since ABCB1-mediated drug efflux can reduce drug intake32,34. Likewise, generating cancer cell lines with high ABCB1 expression to study the biological implications of ABCB1 often requires prolonged exposure of cells to drugs for months41,42. It is, therefore, rather intriguing that various bat cell lines from many different tissues intrinsically possess and maintain high-ABCB1 expression and drug efflux in the absence of known selective pressure. Notably, in addition to xenobiotics, ABCB1 is reported to transport endogenous compounds such as cytokines, short peptide and lipids43,44. It is possible that bat cells may possess endogenous substances that are ABCB1 efflux substrates, and thus express high levels of ABCB1 to maintain homoeostasis.",

Recent work on microRNA biology (miRNA) such as miR-27a46,47, miR-22348 and miR-45146, have also illustrated their potential roles in regulating ABCB1 expression. Furthermore, physiological substances including steroid hormones, environmental stresses such as temperature, osmotic pressure and pH, and xenobiotics such as insecticides, heavy metal and DNA damage reagents have been shown to significantly modulate ABCB1 expression in vitro45. Interestingly, human pathogenic virus and virus proteins are also reported to induce ABCB1 expression49,50. Since bats are renowned for being a reservoir of high mortality viruses like Ebola51 and SARS52, some viral proteins may induce ABCB1 expression. It remains to be elucidated how bat cells induce and retain the high expression of ABCB1.",

Etoposide is a well-known ABCB1 substrate, therefore human and mouse cells would be expected to have higher residual intracellular etoposide than P. alecto cells even after drug removal from the media, leading to more DNA damage and \u03b3H2AX accumulation than P. alecto cells. Thus, the prolonged \u03b3H2AX in human and mouse cells could reflect not only DNA repair but also DNA damage caused by residual etoposide.

ABCB1 knockout mice are not cancer-prone in the laboratory conditions where is free from genotoxic substances but are more sensitive to toxins than wild-type mice39. Therefore, whether ABCB1 knockout mice are cancer-prone in the wild remains to be investigated. Harper et al. have shown that cells derived from wild-trapped mice exhibited different sensitivity to various genotoxic insults than cells derived from laboratory-bred mice62. Hence, we do not exclude the possibility that the environmental background could contribute to the differences we observed between bats and mice. It would be interesting to compare the ABCB1-mediated efflux capacity of bat cells to cells derived from wild mice.",
