We support this proposal: recognition of the interdependence of health and the economy is vital for WHO to achieve its mandate: \u201cthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health\u2026without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition\u201d.2 Given this mandate, WHO should be more ambitious than the appointment of one economist. A more strategic and enlightened approach, especially in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,3 would be for WHO to embrace and articulate a feminist economic agenda.",

Minority ethnic status, class, education, and sexuality determine who is represented in unpaid community health-care worker roles.8 The unpaid and low paid labour of women has contributed to profits for private health-care providers and saved the bottom line of health spending in national budgets: capitalism and patriarchy combine to systematically undervalue social reproductive labour\u2014ie, unpaid care roles as women's work.9\n",
