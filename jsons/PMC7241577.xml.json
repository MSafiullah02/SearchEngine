            "text": "There are stark differences between the Italian and South Korean healthcare systems which have caused them to respond to public health crises in markedly different ways. This is of importance to public health organizations in the Americas because it serves as a guideline for identifying efficacious policies. The Italian healthcare system provides universal coverage, funded primarily by national and regional taxation (1). A majority of care is provided free at the point of delivery. Copayments are collected for outpatient care and drug costs. The public sector accounts for 78.2% of total healthcare spending, and local governments are responsible for the establishment of healthcare services (1). The Italian National Health Service (INHS) provides comprehensive coverage, and local governments are mandated to provide \u201cLivelli Essenziali di Assistenza,\u201d translating to \u201cessential levels of care\u201d and is colloquially abbreviated as \u2018LEAs\u2019 (2). The three main categories of healthcare services encompassing LEAs are: public health, community care, and hospital care (2). As a result of different levels of wealth across different regions, inequities are observed across Italian healthcare (1).",

However, the South Korean system is highly reliant on private providers and patients face substantial out-of-pocket costs. Copayments of 20% are required for services under the single-payer health plan, and for uncovered procedures, patients are required to make full payments. Personal spending accounts for 89.1% of South Korean healthcare expenditures, highlighting the limited role of the government in addressing public health benchmarks (3). However, there is a ceiling on out-of-pocket payments, and discounts are provided on the basis of low income (3). The single insurer in the South Korean healthcare system is the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) (4). All services, including long-term facility care, are paid for by the NHIS after claim reviews. South Korean individuals pay a copayment to their health service provider as well as a contribution to the NHIS. In return, they receive healthcare from their provider of choice while being covered under an NHIS health insurance policy, which reduces their out-of-pocket expenses (4).",

            "text": "With 41 medical schools and 3 500 annual graduates, South Korea has a drastically different medical education system from Italy (5). Medical education in South Korea begins with two years of premedical studies, centered on humanities. The next four years are devoted to a medical curriculum, which emphasizes theoretical concepts than practical applications (6). South Korean medical students rotate between clinical departments on a weekly basis, ensuring a near complete coverage of all the different specialties a Korean hospital has to offer. South Korea is also a leader with regard to the technology available to the medical students, namely in the widespread use of virtual dissections of human bodies (6). Although Italy\u2019s medical education is an equivalent six years; it is sectioned off into two three-year phases, with the first phase being nonclinical scientific education and the second phase being clinical and nonclinical training (7). A major demographic difference between the two nations is that, on average, there are 4.1 physicians per 1 000 people in Italy, which is nearly double South Korea\u2019s 2.4 physicians per 1 000 people (8). Italy is much better medically staffed, and there are policies implemented to regulate the supply of physicians in Italy through avenues such as national quotas, causing Italy to graduate fewer physicians annually than South Korea. Furthermore, Italy has advanced from offering unpaid residency programs with little central oversight to being governed by national goals for paid residency programs set by the National Observatory of Residency Schools. For instance, one goal is that within surgical residencies, Italian residents must perform at least 425 surgical operations with status as a first-operator in \u2153 of those operations (9).",

            "text": "Differences in medical education cause differences in the patient-physician relationship. There is a widespread culture of defensive medicine in Italy due to increased medical litigation, specifically medical malpractice suits (10). This suggests a decreasing trust in physician-patient relationships on a national level. The cornerstone of these suits is informed consent, where patients believe physicians did not appropriately explain medical interventions prior to gaining consent to perform the procedure. This has led to an increase in consent forms in clinics to shield physicians from culpability, detracting from a shared decision framework between patients and physicians. Italian jurisprudence also emphasizes this statute of informed consent to an extent where if a patient does not have complete knowledge of the situation, proceeding with a medical intervention is considered an injury to the patient\u2019s personal dignity (10). This poses significant issues in the cases of pandemics or catastrophic health events because the trust between a patient and physician becomes even more essential in order for patients to obtain effective healthcare services. Italian physicians have taken strides to rectify this fallibility through increased accountability of physicians, increased efficiency of the healthcare system, and providing more appropriate services for patients (10). Conversely, South Korea does not yet teach the patient-physician relationship in the medical education system. Due to national health insurance and government-driven health policy, South Korean physicians are not given freedom to practice self-governance in their relationships with patients (11). This stifles the capacity of medical professionalism, which is essential for building trust in the patient-physician relationship. Hospitals present competitive atmospheres focused on maximizing profits because patients may visit any clinic with referrals (12). This has consequences on trust in the patient-physician relationship because hospitals focus on recruiting physicians capable of attracting patients. Therefore, public perception of clinicians is that they are inferior to physicians staffed in hospitals (12). Patients believe they have sufficient access to primary care institutions and are uncertain when deciding on which institution to select for medical care (12). However, there is concern regarding limited hours offered by primary care providers on weekends and holidays (12). This reinforces South Korea\u2019s struggles due to an overlap in functions between clinics and hospitals, which in turn weakens the function of primary care (12). The Korean healthcare system is predicated on efficiency to reduce costs so when individuals who may be infected with COVID-19 turn to the emergency room instead of their primary healthcare providers for testing, especially in cases with mild symptoms, disproportionate burdens are placed on the emergency care system and subsequently the national healthcare system.",
