Starting March 15 th , all travelers coming back to the kingdom were tested for COVID-19 and were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The same rule was applied to all positive cases identified by contact tracing.

In response to the COVID19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries that applied early and very strict mitigation measures while the number of confirmed cases was still low (300 cases) 8 . On March 15 th , 2020, the Saudi CDC (Weqaya) imposed a new regulation for all travelers coming from outside the kingdom, which is to be quarantined for 14 days in a designated facility regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms. This regulation has helped us to better understand the prevalence of SARS-COV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients.",

This testing-based screening strategy perhaps should be extended to first-line healthcare workers to limit the spread of the disease in hospitals. In addition, countries planning for mitigation measures release should enhance their testing abilities to prevent new outbreaks. Sudden onset of loss of smell and taste might be a predictor of having mild disease. These symptoms might as well be utilized as a marker for testing patients who may be positive for the virus.",
