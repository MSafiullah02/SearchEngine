            "text": "Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are common causes of illness in humans. While such infections tend to be mild and self-limiting in healthy individuals, severe or even life-threatening disease can be seen in immunocompromised hosts, as well as the very young and the elderly. In particular, RVIs are frequently associated with significant morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT). A number of RNA and DNA viruses can cause respiratory tract infections. This chapter focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human coronaviruses (HCoV), and human rhinoviruses (HRV).",

For transplant recipients, disease spectrum similarly spans from asymptomatic or mild infections to life-threatening lower respiratory tract involvement, although severe complications tend to be more frequent. The severity and outcome of infection largely depend on the type of virus as well as host factors, including the type of transplantation and the degree of immunosuppression at the time of infection. Coinfections with other pulmonary pathogens including bacteria or fungi, e.g., Aspergillus species, Pneumocystis jiroveci, or other viruses like CMV or more than one respiratory viruses, are also common and can further complicate treatment and lead to poorer outcomes [1\u20133]. For HSCT recipients, most RVIs occur in 1\u201310% of the patients during the first 100 days post-transplantation [1, 4, 5], with cumulative incidence varying from a few percent (e.g., HMPV, influenza, RSV, PIVs) to 11\u201322% such as HCoV and HRV [5]. Infections with RSV, influenza, HMPV, PIVs, and adenovirus have a higher risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and tend to cause the most serious disease, with mortality rate of up to 40\u201360% among those with LRTI [6\u20139]; HRV and HCoV infections tend to be mild, but severe LRTI from these viruses can rarely occur [10]. Risk factors for disease progression to LRTI include pre-engraftment status, allogeneic transplant, myeloablative conditioning, graft-versus host disease, and lymphopenia [1, 2, 6, 11\u201315].",

BOS is the major limiting factor for long-term survival after lung transplantation [22\u201328]. The reported incidence of BOS associated with RVIs ranges from 6% to 42% [17, 23], while the incidence of acute rejection associated with RVIs varies from 16% to as high as 82% [25, 28\u201330]. For HSCT, BOS is often observed in the setting of chronic graft-versus-host disease, but it has also been associated with RVIs [31\u201334]. Among the respiratory viruses, RSV, PIV, HMPV, and influenza have all been associated with BOS [30, 35, 36], and mortality associated with these viruses can be up to 20% in lung transplant patients [37]. For heart, liver, or kidney transplantation, no relationship between RVI and rejection has been noted [19].",

When compared to no treatment, aerosolized ribavirin decreased the rate of progression to LRTIand mortality with the\ngreatest impact observed when aerosolized ribavirin was given in combination with an immunomodulator. Specifically, when comparing aerosolized ribavirin treatment alone with no treatment, progression to LRTI was decreased from 47% to 25% and the mortality rate was reduced from 89% to 50% [47]. The addition of immunomodulators such as PVZ, IVIG, and/or RSV-IVIG to ribavirin compared to no treatment decreased progression to LTRI from 45% to 12% and mortality rate from 77% to 24%. There are paucity of reports on the use of intravenous or oral ribavirin, but the combined data suggest a benefit compared to no treatment. It is important to recognize that neither of these systematic reviews represented formal meta-analyses; there was no adjustment for confounders, and thus, results should be interpreted with caution. The only trial to date that evaluated PVZ as monotherapy for the treatment ofRSV infection in HSCT recipients\nshowed no benefit in prevention of progression to LRTI or mortality [74].",

However, the use of aerosolized ribavirin\nis cumbersome and very costly with the price increase in 2015 to $30,000 per day [75]. In addition, the aerosolized form of ribavirin is not available in all countries, and the intravenous form is not commercially available in the United States. The experience with oral ribavirin in HSCT is limited and warrants further evaluation, but some studies suggest that it may be a safe and effective alternative to aerosolized ribavirin for the treatment of RSV [51, 76\u201378]. In a retrospective study of 124 HSCT recipients with RSV infection, there was no difference in rates of progression to LRTI and mortality among patients receiving oral compared to aerosolized ribavirin [51]. The optimal dose of oralribavirin for treatment of RSV is unclear and quite variable in the literature [79]. Commonly described dosing strategies include a fixed dose of 600\u2013800 mg two or three times a day or a loading dose of 10 mg/kg followed by 20 mg/kg/day divided into three doses,\nadjusted for renal failure [51, 77, 79].",

Few studies have examined the role of oral ribavirin. Pelaez et al. [81] reported treatment of five lung transplant patients with RSV infection using oral ribavirin in combination with methylprednisolone and found this regimen well tolerated and effective with mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) returning to baseline with treatment. In a prospective observational study, oral ribavirin treatment in 38 patients with RSV, PIV, or HMPV infection was associated with earlier recovery of graft function and prevention of BOS as compared to 29 patients with only supportive care including corticosteroids [82]. In one study that evaluated lung transplant patients who received either aerosolized or oral ribavirin for RSV infection, no significant differences in 6-month outcomes were noted between the two groups, but variations in their adjunctive therapies, e.g., use of corticosteroids, IVIG, and/or montelukast, might have altered the patients\u2019 clinical response [83].

Among those with LRTI, overall mortality at 30 days was 17\u201335% [2, 64]. Independent risk factors for progression to LRTI included receipt of corticosteroids at the time of URTI diagnosis, neutropenia, an APACHE II score >15, and respiratory coinfections. Independent predictors of death included relapsed or refractory underlying cancer, APACHE II score >15, and high-dose corticosteroid use considered in patients given cumulative dose of prednisolone >600 mg within 4 weeks ofPIV diagnosis [2, 14]. Whether steroids are still important if adjusted for lymphopenia requires further study.

In a series that included 55 patients with PIV-3 LRTI, 31 were treated with aerosolized ribavirin with or without IVIG in a nonrandomized fashion. Such therapy did not appear to alter mortality from PIV-3 pneumonia or decrease the duration of viral shedding [2]. A more recent retrospective study evaluated 173 HSCT recipients with PIV infection [90]. Forty-one patients with LRTI were treated with aerosolized ribavirin with or without IVIG, but 100-day mortality of this group was similar to those with LRTI not treated with ribavirin. Overall, there is no convincing evidence that ribavirin is effective for treatment of PIV upper or lower tract disease in HCT recipients. Effective prophylaxis and treatment for PIV in HSCT population are desperately needed.",

In a study [120] of 89 lung transplant patients who presented with RVIs, HMPV and RSV were equally prevalent and had similar clinical manifestations, although severe bronchospasm was less common with HMPV. A significant number of patients with either HMPV or RSV infection developed graft dysfunction (63% and 72%, respectively), but onset or progression of BOS occurred only in patients with RSV (38%) at 6 months and in none with HMPV. Another study of 60 lung transplant patients also showed that HMPV infection increased the risk of acute graft rejectionwithout associated chronic rejection or BOS [3, 120].",

There is considerable overlap in the imaging appearance of viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal respiratory tract infections in transplant population. The findings such as tree-in-bud opacities, bronchial wall thickening, and peribronchiolar consolidation may suggest a viral etiology [138]. HRCT findings between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients are relatively similar [139], but infection with co-pathogens is common among transplant recipients, thus complicatinginterpretation of radiographic findings. Correlation with patient immune status, recent treatment, and exposure history, as well as epidemiologic factors, are essential to help narrow the list of possible etiologies both infectious and noninfectious and to guide diagnostic testing and appropriate therapy [130].",

Overall, RSV pneumonia occurred in 1 of 34 patients for whom HSCT was delayed, compared with two of three patients for whom there was no delay. This study suggested that for HSCT candidates with pretransplant RSV URTI, a delay of HSCT might reduce the risk of developing RSV pneumonia. Thus, the strategy of delaying transplantation to prevent progression of a viral URTI to LRTI is recommended unless precluded by progression of underlying malignancy.

Among patients with LRTI, mortality rates ranged from 15% to 28% and case fatality rates during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic ranged from 0 to 38% [4]. The main risk factor for disease progression to LRTI was lymphopenia; allogeneic HSCT, infection during early post-transplant period, presence of graft-versus-host disease, myeloablative preparatory regimen, and delayed initiation of antiviral therapy were other risk factors [1, 11, 12, 167]. Of interest, concomitant corticosteroid use has not been associated with an increased risk for progression to LRTI, a need for mechanical ventilation, or infection associated death; however, patients given systemic higher doses (\u22651 mg/kg) of corticosteroids may be predisposed to prolonged viral shedding [11, 168].

While diffuse or peribronchial ground-glass opacity is the typical radiographic appearance in patients with LRTI, centrilobular nodules and frank lower lobe consolidation can also be observed [171]. Coinfection with other viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens may occur and was reported in 29% of patients in a multicenter study of SOT recipients with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 [172]. Compared to those with viral co-pathogens, patients with bacterial or fungal coinfections had worse outcomes [11, 172]. Although uncommon, influenza can also a cause a variety of extrapulmonary complications including myocarditis, myositis, encephalopathy, renal failure, severe diarrhea, and pneumomediastinum [166, 173, 174]. Virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome has been reported as a severe complication of pandemic H1N1 leading to multiorgan failure [175]. As discussed previously, several studies suggest an association between RVIs including influenza and allograft rejection/BOS in the case of lung transplants, while others have not; a prospective study is needed to better characterize the impact of these infections on long-term sequelae [19, 44, 172, 176].",

            "text": "Currently, there are two major classes ofantiviral agents with activity against influenza: adamantanes which block the viral M2 protein ion channel, thereby preventing fusion of the virus with host cell membranes, and neuraminidase inhibitors which prevent the release of progeny virus from infected cells. While the adamantanes, amantadine, and rimantadine are only active against influenza A, the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are active against both influenza A and B viruses, although reduced effectiveness of oseltamivir has occasionally been reported for influenza B virus [180]. The development of resistance to the adamantanesamong influenza A virus has substantially limited their utility in clinical practice. Although 2008\u20132009 seasonal H1N1 remained susceptible to the adamantanes, resistance emerged among seasonal H3N2 in 2003 and was widespread among 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Oseltamivir resistance first emerged in 2007 among seasonal H1N1 viruses and was described during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [181]. Oseltamivir resistance is primarily conferred by the H275Y mutation which does not result in cross-resistance to zanamivir. PCR testing is available for the detection of the H275Y mutation. In 2010, the S247 N mutation was detected in strains of 2009 pandemic H1N1 collected in Asia and was found to confer low to moderate oseltamivir and zanamivir resistance [182]. Otherwise, there has been very little zanamivir resistancereported to date, and thus, it is recommended for the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant influenza infection.",

In addition, antiviral resistance appears to occur more commonly among severely immunocompromised patients likely due to prolonged viral shedding [184, 185].

All randomized trials have included healthy adult outpatients who were treated within 48 h after symptom onset and, in aggregate, demonstrate a reduction in duration of symptoms by ~1 day and time to return to normal activity [180]. Although further study is needed regarding the role of antiviral therapy >48 h of symptom onset, the 2009 IDSA guidelines for management of seasonal influenza suggest that antiviral therapy initiated >48 h after symptom onset may be beneficial in hospitalized patients based on a prospective cohort study [167, 180, 187]. Observational studies suggest that early antiviral therapy of HSCT recipients with influenza URTI is effective in preventing progression to LRTI [8, 11, 168, 179, 188]. Among SOT recipients, a multicenter study found that early antiviral therapy was associated with a lower incidence of hospitalization and likelihood of ICU admission as compared to delayed (>48 h after symptom onset) therapy [169]. Although antiviral therapy may have its greatest value when initiated early, it is felt that symptomatic transplant patients may benefit even beyond 48 h if they have evidence of viral replication, and in general, treatment of all symptomatic transplant patients is recommended regardless of the duration of symptoms [189\u2013191].",

However, due to concerns over higher viral loads, prolonged viral shedding, and uncertain drug absorption particularly in those patients undergoing chemotherapy or with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, some experts suggest using the higher dose in transplant patients particularly if absorption is uncertain, in those patients with severe LRTI orwho are critically ill [189\u2013191]. Based on clinical studies in healthy adults, the recommended duration of treatment of influenza in immunocompetent patients is 5 days [180]. However, transplant patients may need longer durations of therapy due to prolonged viral shedding. Some experts recommend treating all SOT recipients until viral replication has ceased; authors recommend checking PCR once a week and treat until negative [190, 191]. Others have suggested a 10-day course for HSCT recipients and extending treatment in those patients with pneumonia, ongoing symptoms, or viral shedding [189].

All vaccines are modified annually based on the anticipated circulating strains during the upcoming influenza season. The LAIV is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients and should not be used in transplant recipients. The intradermal IIV hasnot been evaluated in transplant recipients.",

The timing of vaccine administration appears to predict response with one study demonstrating that influenza immunization at least 6 months afterHCT was 80% effective in preventing influenza [197]. The high-dose trivalent IIV is FDA approved for individuals \u226565 years of age and was found in a multicenter randomized clinical trial to induce higher antibody responses and improved protection against influenza compared to standard dose IIV [198]. In a phase I trial, HSCT recipients randomized to receive high-dose trivalent IIV had evidence of greater immunogenicity when compared to those receiving standard-dose trivalent IIV [199]. There was a higher frequency of injection site reactions, but most were mild. There are ongoing studies to further evaluate the role of high-dose IIV in HSCT.",

Due to the theoretical risk oftransmission of LAIV, the CDC recommends that IIV not be used for household members and health care workers who have close contact with severely immunosuppressed patients such as recipient of hematopoietic stem cell allograft transplantation during those periods in which the patient requires care in a protective environment.
