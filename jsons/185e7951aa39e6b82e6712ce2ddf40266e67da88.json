            "text": "Influenza causes seasonal outbreaks yearly and unpredictable pandemics with high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite significant efforts to address influenza, it remains a major threat to human public health. This issue is partially due to the lack of antiviral drugs with potent antiviral activity and broad reactivity against all influenza virus strains and the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants. Moreover, designing a universal influenza vaccine that is sufficiently immunogenic to induce universal antibodies is difficult. Some novel epitopes hidden in the hemagglutinin (HA) trimeric interface have been discovered recently, and a number of antibodies targeting these epitopes have been found to be capable of neutralizing a broad range of influenza isolates. These findings may have important implications for the development of universal influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs. In this review, we focused on the antibodies targeting these newly discovered epitopes in the HA domain of the influenza virus to promote the development of universal anti-influenza antibodies or vaccines and extend the discovery to other viruses with similar conformational changes in envelope proteins.",

Influenza viruses can be classified according to the diversity of the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [2] . Currently, four types of influenza viruses have been identified: A, B, C, and D types [3] . Influenza A and B viruses are the most dominant among all types, and they circulate, disseminate, and cause seasonal influenza epidemics [4] , which may lead to high mortality and morbidity rates in vulnerable populations (https://www.who.int/news-room/ fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal)). The World Health Organization has identified 18 HA and 11 NA types in influenza A viruses. They can be further classified into two separate groups on the basis of HA type: group 1, which includes H (1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, and 18) ; and group 2, which includes H (3, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 15) . Each group has many subtypes that can infect humans, pigs, sea mammals, and birds [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Influenza viruses have high mutation rates, which cause resistance to existing drugs; in addition, the development of \"universal\" protective antibodies and universal vaccine candidates to induce such antibodies is limited by the diversity and rapid evolution of influenza viruses [7] . Some avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1 [8], H7N9 [9, 10] , and H10N8 [11] , can infect humans. In 1996, the H5N1 virus, which was isolated from a domestic goose, infected humans and caused 18 influenza cases and 6 deaths. Outbreaks of human infection were reported from 1998 to 2003; for example, H5N1 was reported in Hong Kong, China, H9N2 [12] was reported in Guangdong, China, and H7N7 [13] was reported in the Netherlands. In 2013, a new H7N9 avian influenza virus emerged in China and infected about 1500 individuals (http://www.who.int/ csr/don/01-may-2017-ah7n9-china/en/). The spread of the virus from one species to another is a severe risk factor to human health. The diversity and rapid evolution of influenza viruses are also serious problems that limit the development of \"universal\" protective antibodies and universal vaccine candidates to induce antibodies [14] . Furthermore, some highly conserved epitopes in the HA might have low immunogenicity, and they cannot easily induce antibody response. Thus, the key difficulty may be the development of new strategies to strengthen specific immunization and improve specific antibody selection. Yu et al. isolated mAb m826 as a novel epitope in the HA trimeric interface that exerted highly therapeutic effects on mice with a lethal challenge of H7N9 [15] . This interface was previously considered to be hidden but can be exposed according to the recently proposed HA \"breathing\" theory [16] . Consequently, panels of broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting these epitopes were identified [16] [17] [18] . In the present work, we review the recent progress on these novel \"universal\" antibodies and discuss the potential implications of existing studies on influenza drug and vaccine development.",

However, antibodies against M2 are not neutralizing and generally do not confer protection by promoting effector functions on the basis of their Fc regions [21] . Furthermore, the antibody responses toward M2 are typically weak and/or transient after natural influenza infections in humans [22, 23] . NA, another viral surface protein, acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme and removes sialic acid residues from the surface of infected cells to release and spread budding virions [24] . Although NA has lower variability than HA, it also undergoes a certain degree of antigenic drift, which may affect the intensity of NA antibody response to viruses or vaccines. The HA protein facilitates viral infection into host cells and influences the humoral immune response by shielding receptor binding sites (RBSs) and the process of antigenic drift. The antibodies targeting HA could directly neutralize viruses or stimulate the effector functions to eliminate infected host cells [25] . An analysis of blood samples collected from influenza virus-infected or immunized individuals shows that most broadly neutralizing antibodies target HA [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Therefore, the present work mainly focuses on the antibodies that target the highly conserved regions of HA.",

In 2009, mAb S139/1 was isolated from immunized mice with H3 viruses, and it exhibited neutralization activity against the H1, H2, and H3 strains. Its epitope is located in the antigen site B near the RBS [47] . A human monoclonal antibody called CH65 was obtained by isolating it from a subject immunized with the 2007 trivalent influenza vaccine, and it neutralized 30 out of 36 H1N1 strains. An analysis of the CH65-H1N1 complex showed that CH65 binds to the receptor binding pocket on HA1 through HCDR3, mimicking the physiologic interaction between sialic acid and HA [48] . Using phage antibody libraries from a human donor, Ekiert et al. isolated mAb (C05), which binds directly to the RBS on HA and neutralizes strains from multiple subtypes of the influenza A virus, including H1, H2, and H3 [49] . In addition, some broadly neutralizing antibodies whose epitopes are far from the RBS have been described. Two anti-head mAbs, F045-092 and F026-427, were identified from human B lymphocytes by screening with the H3N2 virus; these antibodies showed activity against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses [50] . D1-8 is a human mAb targeting the antigenic site D and exhibits potent, broadly neutralizing activity across antigenically diverse influenza H3 subtype viruses [26] . Moreover, 429B01 is particularly broad and binds to groups 1 and 2 viruses [51] . Antibodies CR8033 and CR8071 recognize a distinct conserved epitope in the HA head domain of the influenza B virus, and they have broad protection against influenza A and B viruses [52] . C12G6 targets a conserved epitope that overlaps with the RBS in the HA region of the influenza B virus and therefore protects against influenza B infection [53] . These previous studies indicated that most anti-HA head regions neutralizing antibodies only offer a narrow line of protection and do not neutralize all influenza subtypes due to the high level of sequence diversity in the HA heads between subtypes, as well as the incorporation of large amounts of glycans in this region.",

            "text": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies usually target the stem region of HA due to the low variability of the stem domain. Such stem-targeted bnAbs recognize the highly conserved regions of the stem and inhibit the conformational changes necessary for viral fusion. Therefore, these bnAbs, e.g., CR9114 and MEDI8852, have more extensive heterotypeneutralizing activity compared with most head-targeted antibodies; some can even target almost all HA types and groups [54] [55] [56] [57] . Recently, panels of neutralizing stemdirected human-derived bnAbs have been reported. A human monoclonal antibody called CR9114 recognizes a conserved epitope in the HA stem and protects against lethal challenges with the influenza A and B viruses [52] . Neutralizing antibodies CR6261, F10, or 70-1F02 against group 1 influenza types target highly conserved pocket regions in the stem of HA using only heavy chains due to a phenylalanine in position 54 at the HCDR2 region unique to the VH 1-69 gene [55, 58] . Prior studies have shown that these antibodies can be elicited by vaccination [59] [60] [61] [62] . However, VH 1-69 -derived antibodies generally do not neutralize groups 1 and 2 strains of influenza A, and only CR9114 can neutralize both groups [63] . By contrast, group 2-specific antibodies, such as CR8020, bind to epitopes closer to virus membranes [64] . As the most extensive heterotype-neutralizing antibodies that recognize both groups of HAs, mAb FI6 and FI6V3 can bind to conserved epitopes in the F subdomain [65] . Moreover, bnAbs specific for the HA stem region usually require FcgR-mediated effector functions, which act via the interactions of the Fc region of the antibodies with FcgR receptors, to protect against influenza virus in vivo and kill virus-infected target cells by attracting immune cells, such as NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils [66] . However, the humoral response of the HA stem region is generally weaker than that of the more immunogenic HA trimer globular head region [17] , leading to the vast generation of anti-HA globular head domain antibodies during infection with an influenza virus. Therefore, developing a universal vaccine that promotes the generation of anti-stem antibodies or using anti-stem antibodies via passive immunization in infected individuals is difficult.",

Several strategies focused on the rational design of HA antigens that could expose conserved epitopes to generate bnAbs [73] [74] [75] [76] . The glycosylation in the HA domain is involved in the antigenic drift of influenza viruses; influenza viruses have been found to introduce or remove glycans to change the viral structure and shield the sites near the RBS on its surface to reduce or evade host immune response [77] [78] [79] . A number of studies engineered glycans to expose the hidden conserved epitopes in the HA domain. For instance, one article reported that modifying glycosylation sites in the HA stem region leads to unmasked sites by N-glycans that elicit effective broadly neutralizing antibodies [80] . Such studies confirmed the potential role of engineering in changing the immunogenicity of antigens and exposing conserved sites, which are the key to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies [76, 81, 82] .",

In their work, the glycans changed the initially diverse antibody response into a focused one. Three monoclonal antibodies were identified and designated as 8H10, FL-1056, and FL-1066. The structural studies showed that the binding sites of the three antibodies belonged to the HA head domain in the same epitope that is ordinarily occluded on a prefusion structure and hidden in the trimeric HA head interface. With the introduction of non-native putative N-linked glycosylation sites, such occluded and highly conserved epitopes were exposed in the glycosylated HA molecules; such condition allowed for the broad (but not complete) antibody mAb 8H10 to recognize all of the identified H3 types and a representative H4 type [16, 76] . The article proposed that hyperglycosylated HA could block some epitopes from exposure to occluded epitopes and elicit broadly protective responses.",

            "text": "A class of anti-influenza virus antibodies targeting the interface of HA trimer has been identified. In 1988, a monoclonal antibody Y8-10C2 was described. Y8-10C2 recognized an epitope located at the interface of adjacent subunits and exposed to antibody binding only after acid treatment of HA [83] [84] [85] . In 2016, a panel of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies, discovered by Georgiou's group and identified in multiple donors who received the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, all bound to a highly conserved epitope on monomeric HA located on the RBS but occluded in the intact HA trimer. Moreover, these antibodies conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against challenge by group 1 and group 2 strains despite their complete lack of neutralization activity in vitro [86] . However, the precise mechanism for protection remains under investigation. Recently, some novel epitopes that are targeted by therapeutic antibodies but are difficult to be accessed in intact trimeric HA have been identified. The H7N9-specifc antibody, m826, is isolated from a large phage-displayed library and binds to HA1 with subnanomolar affinity. Interestingly, m826 exhibits pH-sensitive binding to trimeric HA. It binds to trimeric HA with subnanomolar affinity at pH 5.0; binding at pH 7.4 is about 10-fold weaker. The crystal structure of Fab m826 in the complex with the H7N9 HA1 fragment shows that m826 binds to a unique epitope on H7 HA that is buried in the trimeric structure. The mechanism of action could be deciphered by the \"breathing\" of the HA protomers [15] . Turner et al. also found this mechanism by observing the process of HA binding to a potent influenza H7 HA head-directed mAb through cryoelectron microscopy. The epitope of the antibody is not solvent and accessible in the compact prefusion conformation but is transiently exposed during \"breathing\" [18] . In 2019, a study discovered a naturally occurring human monoclonal antibody, FluA-20, which can protect against almost all influenza types [87] . Structural studies revealed the novel epitopes of FluA-20 that are extremely well conserved on the non-RBS side across diverse types. The novel epitopes are positioned in the 220 loop and the adjacent 90 loop, which is usually buried in the native HA trimer (Fig. 2) .",

The \"breathing\" of the interface of the HA head domain has also been reported [16] [17] [18] 87] . HA0 is the HA precursor protein. HA is assembled into a trimer by protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and is then transported to the cell surface for maturation [91, 92] . HA cleavage is required for the infectivity of influenza viruses [93, 94] . A previous study demonstrated that HA cleavage alters the HA trimer dynamics, influences the presentation of the FluA-20 epitope, and reduces antibody function. Exposure of HA residues allowed these residues to be recognized by FluA-20, thereby confirming the presence of previously unnoticed dynamic features of the HA trimer [87] .",

All these five human antibodies own the collective breadth covering group 1 and almost all of group 2 HA (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, H9, and H14 ). S5-C1-lineage B cell receptors (BCRs) have a similar gene composition. The complex structure of the antibodies bound to monomeric HA has been described [17] . At neutral pH, the epitope on the HA trimer interface recognized by antibodies is normally hidden in the shield to prevent access by the antibody or BCR [88] . However, the HA trimer could undergo conformational changes dynamically with pH adjustment. The HA trimer is more dynamic in the floating pH environment, and if the transiently exposed epitopes encounter B cells, the BCRs can recognize the virus, thus allowing for the induction of the primary immune response against the influenza virus [17, 95] . Although BCRs or antibodies can bind to virus particles, the transient nature of the exposure site results in a binding rate lower than that for fully exposed epitopes. Failure to prevent the initial infection of cells in vitro indicates that the HA trimer's conformational fluctuations expose the epitope at the interface to a certain extent [17, 91, 96] . Thus, only a small fraction of the head interface epitopes could be exposed [97] [98] [99] . These studies also showed that although most BCRs are specific for HA epitopes, only a minority of these broadly cross-reactive memory B cells recognize RBS epitopes. Instead, numerous cross-reactive memory B cells recognize non-RBS epitopes. Therefore, systematic investigations into HA head epitopes that have not been identified to date are important. Such epitopes may prove to be immunogenic components of a broadly protective influenza virus drugs and vaccines.",

This finding suggests the potential to develop small antibody constructs, such as single domain antibodies [106] , which could more easily access the \"breathing\" subdomain or other hidden epitopes than large-sized IgG antibodies. With the establishment and further development of the HA \"breathing\" theory, an increasing number of antibodies targeting the hidden trimeric interface are expected to be discovered in the near future.
