The regulatory changes during this pandemic, coupled with the need to socially distance, may provide the impetus for your implementation of telehealth. One of the first things to consider is how you triage your patients and build your workflows to accurately reflect documentation for your virtual visits (Figure) . Aligning your processes and practice to incorporate the changes is the key to your clinical and operational success.",

Starting on March 6, 2020, 2 the CMS broadened access to Medicare telehealth services, allowing beneficiaries to receive a wider range of services from their providers without having to travel to a healthcare facility. On March 13, 2020, 3 the President declared a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act and made an emergency determination under the Stafford Act. Shortly after this declaration, the CMS announced a set of waivers specific to the pandemic (COVID-19 waivers). 4 Although each waiver is important to how we practice care, let's review one of the waivers, Physicians and Other Clinicians: CMS Flexibilities to Fight COVID-19, 5 issued March 30, 2020, because it affects providers in all settings during this pandemic.",

A few of the areas that directly impact the wound care business include the opportunity to broaden how patients are seen via telehealth and the impact on the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). At the time of writing, there are three main types of virtual services physicians and other professionals can provide to Medicare beneficiaries that are clearly summarized in the regulations. These visit types included Medicare telehealth visits, virtual checkins, and e-visits. Each new service is succinctly defined including who provides the service, what codes can be used for the service, and if the service can be applied when seeing new or established patients. (For more information, review the May Practice Points column, Expanded Telehealth Services Offer Smart Wound Care Workflows.) It is important to work directly with your registration, coding, billing, and medical records departments to determine how telehealth provides you with opportunities to expand your practice and connect with your patients in a virtual setting.",

First, the CMS modified the MIPS Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances policy to allow clinicians who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency to submit an application and request reweighting of the MIPS performance categories for the 2019 performance year. Second, CMS is adding one new Improvement Activity for the 2020 performance year that promotes participation in COVID-19 clinical trials and reporting COVID-19related care data to a clinical data repository or clinical data registry. Last, there is an Improvement Activity related to telehealth. It is entitled Use of Telehealth Services That Expand Practice Access. Take a look to see if these measures apply to your practice for your 2020 quality reporting. 7 With a clear understanding that it remains your responsibility to review the sweeping regulations, let's begin to think through triaging patients and building your processes to map to your clinic or telehealth workflows.",

Define the type of telehealth services provided within your practice. 3. Establish your virtual workflow/documentation sequencing based on your visit types. 4. Build your attestation statements to support the type of telehealth visit based on your regulations. 5. Enable your billing codes to support the telehealth services provided. 6. Configure your patient portal for your portal message, consent management, secure communications, online photo management, and so on. Enable your video conferencing platform. 7.
