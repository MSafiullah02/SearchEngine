The error rate of PCR using the Taq polymerase has been estimated to be between 1/103 and 1/104 nucleotides or less depending on the initial number of target copies (9, 10) and the reaction conditions. Also the RT step may incor- porate errors into the template for the PCR. In this study 6 PCR products of 261 nucleotides equal to 1566 nucleotides were sequenced (Fig. 1 ) and 4 differences were found. This gives a frequency of 1 mutation per 392 bases. From these few differences cannot be distinguished between true genomic variation and experimental errors in PCR or DNA-sequencing. The nucleocapsid gene of coronaviruses seems well conserved. There is only one published sequence of the ATCC type strain HCV-OC43. Comparison of HCV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus nucleocapsid gene (6, 11, 12) show a 96.6% homology of the coding sequences of 1347 bases, and only 6 differences over the 258 bases between the inner primers amplified in this study. Thus large genomic variation may not be expected, even in strains originating from different mammal species. Concerning HCV-229E there are two published sequences of the nucleocapsid gene from the same ATCC type strain (7, 8) .
