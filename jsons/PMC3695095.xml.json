In particular, HRVs are the second main cause of bronchiolitis and wheezing illnesses in infancy, which are strongly associated with a high risk of developing asthma in childhood [4]. It is recognized that 50\u201385% of most asthma exacerbations are caused by HRV infections [5,6,7,8].

HRVs have a 5\u2032 non-coding region (NCR) of about 650 bp that consists of a cloverleaf-like (CL) motif and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, with roles in viral replication and translation initiation, respectively. The IRES of HRVs contains five secondary RNA structures called stem-loops (SLs) 2\u20136 and a polypyrimidine tract (PPT) located between SL5 and SL6 [11].",

HRVs share many features of their genome organization and structure with other picornaviruses. The genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae has undergone much evolutionary genetic diversification through recombination events [20,21,22,23]. HRVs have also developed genetic diversity by recombination near the 5\u2032 NCR/P1, P1/P2 and P2/P3 boundaries [8,10,24,25]. Recombination events between the 5\u2032 NCR and the VP4 encoding sequences have mainly been observed in HRV-C, and the recombination breakpoints have been identified at SL5 and the PPT region [10]. In addition, some HRV-C that are closely related to HRV-A based on sequence analysis of the 5\u2032 NCR have been designated \u201cHRV Ca\u201d, and these HRV Ca subspecies have been suggested to arise from interspecies recombination [10,25,26]. However, the inter- or intraspecies recombination events of field HRV-A and intraspecies recombination events of field HRV-C have not been studied until recently.",

            "text": "HRVs have remarkable genetic and antigenic variability, 102 known serotypes of HRV-A and B, and new types of HRV-C are being discovered continually. It is known that recombination events in the HRV genome have increased the diversity of each virus in the family Picornaviridae [20,21,22,23]. In earlier studies, Lee et al. (2007) analyzed the 5\u2032NCR of 103 HRVs from Wisconsin and confirmed nine novel field strains [13,25]. In 2009, Huang et al. referred to these results and studied recombinant HRV-C among 66 HRVs from cases of ARI. In that study, 14 of 34 strains of HRV-C were found to be related closely to HRV-A by analysis of the 5\u2032 NCR sequences, and these strains of HRV-C were designated as \u201cHRV Ca\u201d. The authors suggested that this strain had arisen from interspecies recombination, and that the Cc subspecies containing the HRV-C 5\u2032NCR and VP4/VP2 sequences had not experienced a recombination event [10,25]. Palmenberg et al. identified intraspecies recombination of the HRV-A strain in three HRV-A reference viruses and interspecies recombination events in HRV-C viruses by phylogenetic and recombinant detection analysis [8,10,24,25]. In the present study, intraspecies recombination events of HRV-A and interspecies recombination events of HRV-C were also detected using similar methods. Surprisingly, we also detected three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination in HRV-A and four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination in HRV-C viruses. The incidence of recombination events was found to be similarly distributed in both HRV-C (11/48 cases) and HRV-A (8/52 cases) strains (P>0.05) by testing for any difference between the two proportions [39]. We also confirmed that interspecies recombination events had occurred in 14 reference strains of HRV-C reference strains: QPM, QCE, NAT001, NY-074, C 24, C 25, C 26, N36, N46, C-43 p1154, CL170085, LZ269, LZY79 and LZY101. Interestingly, KA08-3539 and KA08-4189 have the same nucleotides in the 5\u2032NCR regions which clustered with the C isolate LZ508, but have the different VP4/VP2 sequences. Thus, KA08-3539 (interspecies recombination in HRV-A) and KA08-4189 (intraspecies recombination in HRV-C) were related to HRV-A 42 and to the C isolate LZY101, respectively. KA08-4374 (interspecies recombination in HRV-A) and KA09-756 (intraspecies recombination in HRV-C) also had the same 5\u2032 NCR and differences in the VP4/VP2 sequences. We assume that recombination events in the 5\u2032NCR between VP4 and VP2 could have led to this diversity of HRVs.",

This study showed that the genome of the field virus was more efficient with translation and replication than the artificial recombination genomes [41]. Accordingly, we assume that the translation and replication efficiencies are generally decreased by recombination events during evolution, except for a few favorable combinations and the recombinant viruses may have a different optimal temperature resulting to upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Although genetic and immunological predispositions of patients are primary contributor for determination of disease severity, current results presented here also support that hypothesis, with 18 cases of recombinant viruses in the ARINET isolates but only one case in the SLRI isolates. Another suggestion from the current hypothesis is that sequence information of 5\u2019 NCR and recombination characteristics may lead us to identify a closer relationship between viral diversity and disease severity rather than single criteria of HRVs classification based on VP region sequences.",
