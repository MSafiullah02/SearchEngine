            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is still a threat to human health and poses a global concern due to its unpredictable, pandemic potential and pathogenesis. As high evolutionary rates of the influenza virus makes vaccination strategies difficult, anti-influenza drugs are crucial for the control of influenza pandemics. Antiviral therapy is generally licensed for use within 48 h of influenza illness onset, and delaying treatment is associated with decreased drug efficacy and increased morbidity and mortality (Kandun et al., 2008). Although influenza-induced pathology is still unclear, the uncontrolled immune response may be the major contributor to influenza virus-induced mortality (de Jong et al., 2006, Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2011, Kobasa et al., 2007). Thus, studies on the modulation of the host immune response are currently underway. Several animal studies have shown that anti-inflammatory agents can protect mice from death against influenza infection. 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) has been shown to protect 79% of mice from death against lethal influenza infection through manipulation of the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway, whereas it does not inhibit virus replication (Cloutier et al., 2012). The P38 inhibitor significantly protects mice from lethal influenza infection without affecting virus replication (Borgeling et al., 2014). Statins not only reduce the levels of LDL-cholesterol, but they also counteract the inflammatory changes associated with acute coronary syndrome and improve survival in patients with influenza. Similarly, in patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza, statin treatment is associated with a 41% reduction in 30-day mortality (Fedson, 2013). Therefore, strategies targeting aberrant host immune responses may be good complements for existing antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "The routine strategies for anti-influenza drug development rely primarily on cell-based assays in primary screening followed by animal studies. However, the cost of in vivo studies is very high due to the use of animals and a large quantity of investigational compounds. Lung slices, which provide a bridge between single cells and whole animals, are broadly used in physiology and toxicity studies (Morin et al., 2013, Sanderson, 2011). Different from single cell lines, lung slices possess multiple cell types and preserve the physiological and functional cellular relationships within the body. Cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix interactions result in lung slices closely resembling the morphology and functionality of the lung. Whereas the evaluation of the efficacy of a drug based on animal studies is expensive and time-consuming, the lung slice model may serve as a valuable tool for efficacy tests of compounds for the treatment of influenza. With the development of tissue slicers, which produce slices rapidly and reproducibly, an increasing number of studies have employed lung slices to explore the interaction of hosts and pathogens (Chakrabarty et al., 2007, Londt et al., 2013, Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011, Seehase et al., 2012, Van Poucke et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2010). Recently, several studies have shown that pig lung slices can support influenza virus replication (Londt et al., 2013, Van Poucke et al., 2010). Another study demonstrated that influenza virus infection can induce robust cytokine and chemokine responses in human lung slices (Wu et al., 2010). Theoretically, the three-dimensional lung slice culture system can be used to evaluate the potency of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents against influenza virus infection.",

After anesthetisation by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (75 mg/kg), the mouse was bled through the abdominal aorta. Then, the trachea was exposed, dissected from surrounding tissues and was cannulated with an 18-gauge needle. Through the cannula, the lung was inflated with 1.3 ml of 2% low-melting agarose (BIO-RAD) dissolved in Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution (HBSS) solution. The whole animal was cooled with ice for 10 min to solidify the agarose and, thereby, the lung. Then, the lung was taken out en bloc from the thoracic cavity and placed in the slice culture medium (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12, DMEM/F-12, GIBCO) at 4 \u00b0C for an additional 15 min to completely solidify the agarose. The culture medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 250 ng/ml of amphotericin to avoid contamination. The lung lobe was afterwards dissected and cut to create a flat surface at the end of the primary bronchus. Another flat surface was cut approximately 0.8 cm from the first surface. The cube was maintained in the pre-chilled slice culture medium prior to or during the slicing. The cube was cut into slices of desired thickness using a vibratome slicer (Leica, VT1200S). Each mouse lung cube generated at least 24 250-\u03bcm slices. The slices were then transferred into a 48-well cell culture plate and covered with 250 \u03bcl of slice culture medium in each well. The medium was changed every hour at least three times before virus infection to remove cell debris.",

As shown in Fig. 1\n, a strong bronchoconstriction (compare A with B) could be induced on days 1, 3 (data not shown) and 5 after treatment with 0.1 \u03bcM acetyl-\u00df-methylcholine chloride. The removal of the drug resulted in relaxation of the airway (Fig. 1C). To further assess the viability of lung slices, the live/dead staining method was used to evaluate whether the alveolar architecture remained intact and alive after preparation and ex vivo culture. As shown in Fig. 1, the slices were almost 100% green (viable cells) directly after preparation (Fig. 1D), whereas treatment of the slices with 1% Triton-100 resulted in only red nuclei staining (dead cells, Fig. 1E). In addition, the mouse lung slices stayed alive and the alveolar architecture in lung slices remained intact up to 5 days after preparation (Fig. 1F\u2013H). Collectively, these results suggest that the mouse lung slices can be kept alive for at least 5 days after preparation.",

            "text": "Because the lung slices can survive under ex vivo conditions, we assessed whether influenza viruses can infect and replicate in the mouse lung slices. First, lung slices with different thicknesses were generated to determine the optimal thickness of lung slice suitable for the infection of influenza viruses. As expected, 250-\u03bcm thick slices produced more infectious virions 48 h post-infection than 125-\u03bcm thick slices. However, the virus yields of 500 and 1000-\u03bcm thick slices were similar to those of 250-\u03bcm thick slices (Fig. 2\nA). These results suggest that 250-\u03bcm thick lung slices are the best for infection with influenza virus, balancing cost and efficiency. Next, the growth curves of influenza viruses in mouse lung slices were obtained. As shown in Fig. 2D and E, both PR8 (H1N1) and HUBEI (H3N2) viruses demonstrated time-dependent replication and reached their maximum titre 48 h post infection, though the virus titres ex vivo are much lower than those in cell culture. Neuraminidase (NA) activity results (Fig. 2B and C) showed that both virus strains have similar kinetics in virus replication and infectivity (Fig. 2D and E), suggesting that NA activity can precisely represent the virus replication and infectivity in lung slices. To further correlate NA activity and virus titre, ribavirin and U0126 were tested for dose dependent inhibition. As shown in Fig. S1, both compounds exhibit dose dependent inhibition of NA activity or virus infectivity, indicating that NA activity can be used to represent virus replication in the primary screening. To further confirm the infection of the lung slices by influenza virus, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to stain the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus on the lung slices. As shown in Fig. 2F, the lung slice was strongly infected by influenza virus. Overall, these results demonstrated that lung slices support influenza virus replication.",

Many cytokines and chemokines are elevated in influenza-infected mice and seem important in influenza-induced inflammation. Despite complications in the cytokine storm induced by influenza virus infection, we chose eight important cytokines and chemokines (Belisle et al., 2010, Brandes et al., 2013, Lauder et al., 2013, Szretter et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2013, Weiss et al., 2010) to study the inflammatory response following influenza virus infection. First, we examined the mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines in influenza virus-infected lung slices by real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3\nA and B, exposure to 105\n PFU/ml doses of PR8 and HUBEI viruses resulted in elevated mRNA levels of most cytokine and chemokine genes tested. At 12 h post infection, the gene transcriptions were elevated and were highly activated at 48 h post infection. The cytokines and chemokines with the highest levels of induction in transcription by both viruses were RANTES and IP-10. Because the cytokine and chemokine responses mediated by the two viruses at transcription level are similar, the PR8 influenza virus was used for the steady protein level analysis. We then further determined the protein levels of selected cytokines and chemokines in response to influenza virus infection at 24 h and 48 h post infection. As shown in Fig. 3C, after exposure to PR8 virus for 24 h, the protein levels of all tested cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated except for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10. IFN-\u03b3 was undetectable in the supernatant of the lung slices. The fold increase over mock for TNF-\u03b1, MIP-3\u03b1, IL-6, RANTES and IP-10 were 2.1, 3.3, 2.4, 1.7 and 8.9, respectively. At 48 h post infection, higher levels of cytokines and chemokines were induced (Fig. 3D), and the fold increases were 4, 4.4, 3, 4 and 19, respectively. IP-10 was the most highly stimulated chemokine at both 24 h and 48 h post infection, which is consistent with the results of its mRNA response to virus infection. Taken together, our results suggest that a strong inflammatory response represented by the highly elevated mRNA and protein levels of cytokines and chemokines are triggered by the infection of influenza viruses in the ex vivo mouse lung slice.",

To meet the goal of this study in the establishment of an ex vivo mouse slice model for the screening and evaluation of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs against influenza infection in one assay, ensuring that the ex vivo model has similar patterns in influenza-induced cytokine and chemokine responses is critical. As shown in Fig. S2, the inflammatory responses in vivo on day 3 post-infection appeared to be most robust. The cytokine/chemokines levels in vivo on day 3 were chosen to compare with that ex vivo. The results from mouse studies showed that IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-10 exhibited lower levels of activation (181 pg/ml, 115 pg/ml, 198 pg/ml and 278 pg/ml, respectively), whereas MIP-3\u03b1, IL-6, RANTES and IP-10 exhibited higher levels of activation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF, 625 pg/ml, 982 pg/ml, 1216 pg/ml and 5000 pg/ml, respectively). The elevated expression of most of the tested cytokines and chemokines in the supernatant of lung slices demonstrated the same expression pattern compared with that in the mouse model (Figs. 3C, D and 4\nA). To evaluate the correlation between ex vivo and in vivo levels of cytokines and chemokines, a linear regression analysis model was employed. The levels of cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants of the lung slices 24 h post infection (Fig. 3C) were compared to that in the BALF of mice 3 day post infection. The results show that there is a positive correlation between ex vivo and in vivo expression of selected cytokines and chemokines with a coefficient of correlation of 0.75 (Fig. 4B). More specifically, IP-10, RANTES and MIP-3\u03b1 are perfectly correlated. The coefficient of correlation between cytokines and chemokines in the supernatant of lung slices 48 h post infection (Fig. 3D) and that in the BALF of mice 3 day post infection was 0.61 (Fig. S3). Our results here demonstrated that the ex vivo mouse lung slice model resembles the in vivo mouse model in response to influenza virus infection. In addition, IP-10, RANTES and MIP-3\u03b1 may serve as readouts in the screening and evaluation of anti-inflammatory agents against influenza infection.",

The Z\u2032 factor, a screening window coefficient, can be used to evaluate the quality of assays (Zhang et al., 1999). Neuraminidase was chosen as a readout for antiviral activity, which was confirmed to correlate well with the production of infectious virions (Fig. 2B\u2013E). IP-10 was chosen as a readout to represent the influenza virus-induced inflammation for three reasons: (a) it exhibits good correlation between in vivo and ex vivo models at the protein level, (b) it is the most highly induced chemokine in the mouse model and in the lung slice model, and (c) IP-10\u2212/\u2212 mice or mice treated with anti-IP-10 antibody demonstrate global down-regulated cytokines and chemokines and can survive after challenged by a lethal dose of influenza virus (Wang et al., 2013). Therefore, ribavirin was used to determine its NA and IP-10 inhibition effects to test the performance of the lung slice model. Four replicate plates were processed to determine the Z\u2032 factor. As shown in Table 1\n, a Z\u2032 factor ranging from 0.53 to 0.71 for NA inhibition and 0.58 to 0.73 for IP-10 inhibition demonstrated that the quality of the lung slice model for the evaluation of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects is satisfactory.",

Though the transformed cells are convenient for high throughput screening and the in vitro study of potency and mechanisms, they are distantly related to physiological and pathological conditions. As a consequence, results based on transformed cells may suffer from simplification. Current treatments for influenza rely on the use of antiviral drugs; however, the window for antiviral therapy is narrow. Several reports have shown that anti-inflammatory agents can be effective in reducing the death rate against the infection of lethal influenza (Borgeling et al., 2014, Cloutier et al., 2012). Moreover, current antiviral drug screening is performed primarily using cell-based assays. The cell-based assays available for the development of anti-inflammatory agents against influenza virus infection are largely targeting single host factors or pathways that play a role in the influenza-induced inflammatory response. Such strategies could be very risky for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs and lead to failure in animal tests or in clinical trials. Whereas animal models, e.g., mice and ferrets, are good for efficacy studies in of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs, they are not time- or cost-efficient. To overcome this problem, at least in part, we have established the mouse lung slice model to test drugs for antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities in one ex vivo assay with the convenience of the in vitro cell-based assay. The goals for this model are as follows: (i) the mouse slices can remain alive long enough for efficient influenza virus infection and inflammatory response; (ii) the inflammatory response is similar to that in the lung of mouse; (iii) to choose the best readouts for the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities in the model; and (iv) to validate the model using antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents with confirmed efficacy in vitro and in vivo.",

In our research, results from bronchoconstriction experiments and live/dead staining experiments demonstrated that lung slices remained alive for at least 5 days.

Our results demonstrated that influenza viruses replicate efficiently in the mouse lung slices. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that the influenza virus can replicate in pig lung slices (Van Poucke et al., 2010). By IFA, mouse lung slices were clearly shown to be infected by influenza virus. To analyse the inflammatory response of lung slices following the infection of the influenza virus, we measured the levels of cytokine and chemokine and compared them with those in the BALF of mice. Our results showed that a positive correlation exists between the ex vivo and in vivo models in the expression of selected cytokines and chemokines with a coefficient of correlation of 0.75. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly induced in vivo but not ex vivo. This may be due to an influx of multiple types of immune cells in the lung in vivo but not in the lung slice. The lower levels of IL-1\u03b2 in lung slices may be due to the observation that the epithelial cells and macrophages secreted less IL-1\u03b2 than neutrophils in responds to influenza infection (Brandes et al., 2013). The observation that IFN-\u03b3 secretion was not detected in lung slices can be explained by the fact that the primary source of IFN-\u03b3 are NK cells, CD4+ Th1 cells and CD8+ T cells (Schroder et al., 2004), which are absent in the lung slice. Despite the discrepancy in some of the cytokine and chemokine responses, IP-10, RANTES and MIP-3\u03b1 are perfectly correlated between the ex vivo and in vivo models. Therefore, IP-10, RANTES and MIP-3\u03b1 may represent the inflammatory response following influenza virus infection in the ex vivo model.",

            "text": "The choice of readout for antiviral effects is straight forward and was determined previously in our lab. The fluorometric substrate of the neuraminidase of the influenza virus, MUNANA, is used for detection of virus neuraminidase activity, which represents the levels of virus replication (An et al., 2014). The virus replication level determined by NA activity is proportional to that of the TCID50 as shown in Fig. 2 (compare 2B and 2D, 2C and 2E). However, the choice of readout for anti-inflammatory activity is much more complicated because no known cytokine or chemokine is widely accepted to represent the inflammatory response to influenza infection. Based on the comparison between ex vivo and in vivo responses of the selected cytokines and chemokines following influenza virus infection, IP-10, RANTES and MIP-3\u03b1 may serve as readouts for influenza-induced inflammation. In the recent literature, to elucidate which cytokine and chemokine is more important in the influenza-induced innate immune response, cytokines or their receptor gene were knocked out in mice. TNFR1\u2212/\u2212, IL-6\u2212/\u2212, MCP-1\u2212/\u2212, IL-1R\u2212/\u2212, MIP-1\u2212/\u2212, CCR2\u2212/\u2212, and GM-CSF\u2212/\u2212 mice did not survive influenza infection; however, IP-10\u2212/\u2212 mice did survive influenza infection, suggesting that IP-10 may play an important role in the aberrant cytokine responses during influenza infection (Darwish et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2013). IP-10 has also been proposed to be a poor prognostic indicator for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is clinically similar to severe influenza infection (Nelli et al., 2012). Although we did not compare the proteome changes induced by influenza, the rationale to choose a single factor to prove the concept has been previously reported (Cameron et al., 2008). Taking these results into consideration, we chose IP-10 as a readout for the evaluation of anti-inflammatory drugs, and IP-10 appeared to be valid for representing the inflammatory response in the validation test of a panel of antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents. Of course, if a critical study of the efficacy of a candidate compound is required, multiple readouts determined by the levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines can be used to assess the inhibitory effects against the inflammatory response following influenza virus infection.",

To validate this precision cut mouse lung slice model in screening and evaluation of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs against influenza virus infection in one assay using NA and IP-10 as readouts, four categories of known antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs were tested for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. The results were compared with that from mouse studies conducted by others and us. The four categories of agents are: (i) agents with only antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo; (ii) agents with both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo; (iii) agents with only anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo; (iv) agents with antiviral effects in vitro which failed in the mouse model. The agents of the first three categories showed antiviral or anti-inflammatory effects in the lung slice model. Among the agents from the category IV, all failed to show any antiviral or anti-inflammatory activity on the mouse lung slice model, except that nafronyl oxalate was shown to inhibit IP-10 release. Overall, this validation testing of a group of agents with known antiviral or anti-inflammatory activities demonstrated that the mouse lung slice model is valid, convenient and cost-efficient for screening and evaluation of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs in one ex vivo assay. It appears that only drugs showing either antiviral or anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse lung slice model may protect mice from infection of lethal influenza, though exceptions may occur.",

Importantly, employing the lung slice model is economical in term of experiment costs, in compound synthesis and animal use. For the development of antiviral drugs, the mouse lung slice model is more similar to the mouse model. For the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, the mouse lung slice model is suitable for drugs targeting multiple targets and pathways involved in the inflammatory response following influenza infection and more similar to the mouse model. This model can be useful in the secondary screening for selection of drug candidates with potent antiviral or (and) anti-inflammatory activities before testing in an animal model.",

Firstly, to make sure that the virus being tested can replicate efficiently on mouse lung slices and induce cytokine/chemokine responses similar to that in vivo. Secondly, the readout(s) for the inflammatory response can be different and should be determined experimentally ex vivo and in vivo. Considering that the infection of many respiratory viruses causes acute inflammation in the human lungs and induce similar inflammatory responses, it is likely that the anti-inflammatory drugs developed using the influenza virus infected mouse lung slice model may also be effective in the treatment of infection of other respiratory viruses.",
