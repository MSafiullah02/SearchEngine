In this study, the fecal coliform concentrations in 21 river sections were monitored for 20 months, and 441 samples were analyzed. Multivariable regressions were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fecal coliform. The results showed that spatial differences were mainly dominated by urbanization level, and environmental factors could explain the temporal dynamics of fecal coliform in different urban patterns except in areas with high urbanization levels. Reducing suspended solids is a direct way to manage fecal coliform in the Beiyun River when the natural factors are difficulty to change, such as temperature and solar radiation. The export of fecal coliform from urban areas showed a quick and sensitive response to rainfall events and increased dozens of times in the short term. Landscape patterns, such as the fragmentation of impervious surfaces and the overall landscape, were identified as key factors influencing urban non-point source bacteria.

Microbial pollution around the world is routinely assessed using concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) including Escherichia coli and enterococci as proxies for pathogenic organisms (Wyn-Jones et al., 2011) . Such bacteria are present in the feces (Stachler et al., 2017) , runoff (Molina et al., 2014) and sewage discharges , and their presence is a considerable issue concerning river risk management and human health risk (Chenar and Deng, 2018) . As a type of FIB, fecal coliform (FC) has been widely used in the risk assessment of microbial pollution in water Uprety et al., 2020) . The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and the European Environment Agency (EEA) both use FC as one of the microbiological indicators of drinking water quality. The FC index is particularly important especially in areas where marine products are abundant (Wang and Deng, 2019) . Previous studies have reported two significant observations of the worldwide FC situation. On the one hand, FC is inherently bioactive, differing from other physical and chemical pollutants, and the reported amount of microbial pollution in the environment has raised concerns regarding ecosystem and human health (Frena et al., 2019) . On the other hand, the state and concentration of FC in water bodies are dynamic and are related to environmental factors (Chen and Liu, 2017; Carpenter et al., 2019; Jeon et al., 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 445, "text": "(Wyn-Jones et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 487, "end": 510, "text": "(Stachler et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 520, "end": 541, "text": "(Molina et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 664, "end": 687, "text": "(Chenar and Deng, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 804, "end": 824, "text": "Uprety et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1126, "text": "(Wang and Deng, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1463, "text": "(Frena et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1608, "text": "(Chen and Liu, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1632, "text": "Carpenter et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1651, "text": "Jeon et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A growing body of research has proven that the dynamic nature of FC survival and concentration in surface water bodies is driven by emissions and environmental factors that determine FC transport and fate (Mitch et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2015) . FC can reproduce rapidly under optimal environmental conditions for growth, and reproduction varies with factors such as water temperature, temperature, solar radiation, rainfall and turbidity (Leight et al., 2016; Chen and Liu, 2017) . Regression models can be applied to explore how one environmental factor affects FC levels while the remaining factors are fixed; however, it usually has poor fitness. This result may be due to the complicated and nonlinear relationship between environmental factors and FC (Fan et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2016; Wang and Deng, 2019) . Several additional studies have investigated the link between land-use types and FC concentration, including urban development levels, agriculture-dominated watersheds and comparisons of different watershed types (Sliva, 2001; Walters et al., 2011; Chow et al., 2013; Mcmichael et al., 2013; Badgley et al., 2019) . Vitro et al. (2017) found that road density was positively correlated with FC contamination and negatively related to the area of water body. In addition, regions with water quality degradation due to nutrients usually have high FC concentrations, and this result has been found in other studies (Mallin et al., 2000) . Forest and grass may be positively correlated with FC concentrations in water bodies because these landscapes provide places for poultry breeding (Smith et al., 2001) . Together, these studies have indicated that the watershed-scale FC dynamics could be predicted by examining FC occurrence and concentration data coupled with environmental factors. However, the limited scope of these monitoring datasets and the combination of landscape patterns related to the transmission path of non-point source pollution (NPS) have not allowed for generalizable conclusions regarding how such programs coupled with environmental factors impact the contaminant levels in a complex watershed with mixed land-use types.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 225, "text": "(Mitch et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 226, "end": 243, "text": "Liu et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 439, "end": 460, "text": "(Leight et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 461, "end": 480, "text": "Chen and Liu, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 757, "end": 775, "text": "(Fan et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 776, "end": 794, "text": "Tong et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 795, "end": 815, "text": "Wang and Deng, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1044, "text": "(Sliva, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1066, "text": "Walters et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1085, "text": "Chow et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1109, "text": "Mcmichael et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1131, "text": "Badgley et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1153, "text": "Vitro et al.

Ra values of 1e10 were mainly distributed along the lower Beiyun River (the regions of P4 and P5), which were urban-rural mixed areas and rural-cultivated dominated areas, respectively. However, the monitoring sites located at upstream exhibited different degrees of dilution, where the land-use types were dominated by forest. Forestland as a sink landscape can reduce NPS pollutants into water bodies, which supports the conclusion of a previous study in which the proportion of forest cover was negatively correlated with FC within a watershed (Mello et al., 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 276, "text": "Leight et al (2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1209, "text": "(Mello et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 153, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Influence of event-scale rainfall on FC concentration"}, {"text": "Lasso regression analysis was conducted between FC concentration (log-transformed) and environmental factors during the monitoring period, excluding December and January because of complications, and the regression was examined by cross validation (Figs.

In this study, the FC concentration in the Beiyun River responded more actively to a combination of environmental factors, indicating that multiple environmental factors should be used to explain FC levels in water bodies. This result is consistent with previous studies (Thoe et al., 2014; Leight et al., 2016; Badgley et al., 2019; Wang and Deng, 2019) . However, the temporal dynamics of FC in P3 failed due to other complex anthropogenic influences in the urban areas, particularly from the point source input. As shown in Fig. S20 , it was found that most failures in the regression models were consistent with the distribution and annual discharge of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Beiyun watershed. This result agrees with Boehm et al. (2018) , who found that FC pollution in surface water will greatly increase due to the discharge of sewage water. It can be seen that the WWTPs with high discharge are mainly located in P3, indicating that point source discharge is another important source of FC pollution in this region.

Previous studies have also reported that SS was positively associated with FC concentration, indicating that suspended solid might be as a more suitable place to survive than in water (Fang et al., 2018) . There is a negative correlation between rainfall and FC concentration in P1, where the forest land accounted for a considerable proportion. Badgley et al. (2019) also found that natural forest negatively associated with FC. Interestingly, solar radiation was identified as another significant predictor of FC, having a negative association, which may mask the high concentration of FC caused by stormwater runoff in the wet season; this result may be especially true in AprileJune, which have the highest solar radiation (Fig. S6) and initial rainfall events that will bring numerous pollutants due to long antecedent dry days. The lower FC concentration during the months of SeptembereNovember was mainly inhabited by living conditions, such as lower air temperature and water temperature (a positive correlation between FC and them).

Table 2 shows the spatial regression model (M S ) with the factor selection process in Fig. S19 . The spatial difference was mainly driven by the land use distribution that was used to distinguish different urban patterns. The spatial model in this study suggested that agricultural land, impervious land and industry were the dominant sources of the fecal pollution. This result is consistent with Crim et al. (2012) , who focused on watersheds with different land uses in four countries. Unexpectedly, forest was identified as a significant factor with a positive correlation. In previous studies, forest was negatively associated with fecal pollution in surface water and has been suggested as a sink landscape (Vitro et al., 2017; Badgley et al., 2019) , while only some studies, such as Smith et al. (2001) , indicated a positive correlation. This may depend to a large extent on the characteristics of the watersheds, and for the studied urban watershed, the artificial forest is planted in the urban areas with a large amount of added fertilizer, which may be the source landscape of FC. Besides, population density and road density together represent the urbanization level but show opposite trends for the interpretation of FC. Roads are an important place for pollutant accumulation, while areas with high population density often have complete sewage treatment systems that reduce the discharge of FC in domestic sewage. Same conclusion was made by Vitro et al. (2017) . Importantly, the sustained urban NPS caused by rapid urbanization may account for a considerable proportion of FC pollution (Bonkosky et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2015; Mattioli et al., 2017) .
