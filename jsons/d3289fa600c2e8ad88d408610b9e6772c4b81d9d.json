This instrument is based on linkages among the region's institutions from the public and private sector. These linkages are very important because they provide an environment for the innovation process, which is the primary goal of the RIS. In this paper, we have defined and described the main characteristics common to every RIS. Knowledge of these characteristics allows us to create a new method to make it possible to analyze individual RISes. The goal of this chapter is to present a new method for evaluating RISes. The method must by easily applied in order for it to be used practically to map the development of the individual innovative systems in a region. The method is based on evaluating both qualitative and quantitative indicators and on applying WSA methods. The paper presents the application of this method on individual regions in the Czech Republic (NUTS3).",

Majority of them is in line with Cooke's definition (Cooke 2006) : RIS are useful for studying economic and innovative performance; they are also functional tools to enhance the innovation processes of firms. They do this by knitting together knowledge flows and the systems on which they rely, building trust and confidence in institutional reliability; and above all, they do it by generating institutional self-knowledge and a certain kind of collective dissatisfaction with the status quo. RIS comprise a set of institutions, both public and private, which produce pervasive and systemic effects that encourage firms in the region to adopt common norms, expectations, values, attitudes and practices, where a culture of innovation is nurtured and knowledge-transfer processes are enhanced (Matatkova and Stejskal 2011b ). Asheim and Coenen (2005; in Stejskal and Matatkova 2011b) divide the RIS this way:",

Territorially embedded regional innovation systems are similar to grassroots RIS by Cooke (2006) , the best examples of this type are networks of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in industrial districts. These systems provide bottom-up, 1 That it was temporary refers to the fact that, in the past 15 years, certain researchers have pointed to the significance of national innovation systems, even proposing the creation of national systems by using regional ones (e.g., Chung 2002; Guan and Chen 2012; Borr\u00e1s and Edquist 2013; Lyasnikov et al. 2014) to the significance of national innovation systems, even proposing the creation of national systems by using regional ones (e.g., Chung 2002; Guan and Chen 2012; Borr\u00e1s and Edquist 2013; Lyasnikov et al. 2014). network-based support through, for example, technology centers, innovation networks, or centers for real service providing market research etc. (Storper and Scott 1995 in Asheim and Coenen 2005) . Regionally networked innovation system means that firms and organizations are also embedded in a specific region and characterized by localized, interactive learning. This type is very similar to network RIS by Cooke. We can say that a networked innovation system is a result of policy intervention to increase innovation capacity and collaboration. Regionalized national innovation system is different from the two systems above in two main points. First, parts of industry and the institutional infrastructure are more functionally integrated into national or international innovation systems. Second, the collaboration between organizations within this type of RIS conforms more closely to the linear model, as the co-operation primarily involves specific projects to develop more radical innovations-based on formal analytical-scientific knowledge. Cooke named this type of RIS system dirigiste RIS. The concrete example of this system could be technopoles or science parks. For more information see Asheim and Coenen (2005b) . Braczyk et al. (1998) , Asheim and Coenen (2005) , Cooke (2006) divide the RIS according to the size of the region's incorporated companies, their financing methods or the territorial limits of the regional innovation system. It is also possible to divide regional innovation systems according to the degree of their infrastructure development within the region:",

T\u00f6dtling and Trippl (2005) further add that in the ideal case, there are intensive interactive relationships within and between these subsystems facilitating and continuous flow or exchange of knowledge, resources and human capital.

The spill-over effects are learning during the co-operation and practice, and at the same time there is a significant cultivation of public policy that re-emphasizes the importance of knowledge as a production factor.",

Social network analysis is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, computers or other information/knowledge processing entities (Krebs 2002) . Social network or network analysis centers on the arrangement of relationships among actors and assess how resources are exchange among the various actors (Scott 1991; Wasserman and Faust 1994) . The RIS is composed of numerous interactions among the various social entities and this result in the creation of network capital. So to evaluate the how this social network thrives, the interdisciplinary methodology can be used. Social Network Analysis has therefore proven to be useful because it enables the visualization of how people are connected, thereby enabling users of this methodology to find out how best people and institutions interact to share knowledge in the RIS. This methodology is built on the belief that social network are very important for the collaborating entities (Wassermann and Faust 1994) and society as a whole because of the end product that leads to transformation of the entities and society as a whole.",

For a better and comprehensive understanding of networks and the participants involved, one needs to evaluate where the network is taking place (its location) and composition of actors that make up the network. These procedures provide us with a better understanding into the various roles and categories in a network-who constitute the connectors, where are the clusters and their makeup, who forms the center of the network, and who is on the periphery. This methodology can be relied upon in RIS when we endeavor to assess the rate at which knowledge and information flow across functional and institutional borders as in triple helix. It can also be useful when we want to find out who knows who (social relationships) and who might know what (expertise) in groups where individuals play key roles. One advantage of using this methodology in RIS is that, it provides it helps us to understand and simplifies the complex nature of interorganizational networks.

According to (Romesburg 2004) , cluster analysis refers to combinations of mathematical models that can be utilized to group objects that are similar into the same group. All objects have their attributes which might not be the same, but when has many objects, there is bound to be different attributes, so these can be arrange to for a cluster.

The cluster in reference here is not assumed to be the same as happens in other forms of interaction they are very similar and linked in the value chain. Clusters can either be horizontal or vertical (cross-sectorial) network that consist of industries that are not the same but complementary firms that have a specific specialization that can result in the creation of innovation (Morgan 1997) . The cluster analysis approach differs from other conventional research approaches because it takes into account collaborations and knowledge flow within the network (Rouvinen and Yl\u00e4-Antilla 1999) . Comparatively, the conventional research approaches have focuses on networks that have homogenous firms producing same products, but the cluster have proven to be a reliable alternative because, it offers a different view in the RIS in the sense that, it places premium on the interaction-based theories of innovation which many authors now called \"triple helix\" (see Leydesdorff 2012; Vaivode 2015) . This dynamic nature of the cluster analysis has made it a reliable alternative to the other traditional research approaches (Roelandt and Den Hertog 1999) . Another reason that has made cluster analysis so important is its focus on vertical relationship and interdependence of actors who may not necessarily be similar firms or institutions (Roelandt and Den Hertog 1999) .",

The study also found out that technical expertise and sales opportunities directly correlate with operational efficiency of 3PLs at the same time, there was no direct correlation between the size of 3PLs and their performance. Abbott and Doucouliagos (2003) also used the DEA model to evaluate the efficiency of Australian universities. Their result proved that irrespective of the blend of input and outputs, Australian universities recorded high levels of efficiency relatively when compared one by one. In a study to measure the performance of 500 manufacturing firms in Turkey D\u00fczak\u0131n and D\u00fczak\u0131n (2007) used the DEA methodology and came out with the conclusion that during 2003 nine firms efficiently performed in Turkey, and out of these nine firms ranked among themselves.

The case studies are pertinent when the research being undertaken addresses either a descriptive question or an explanatory question (Shavelson and Towne 2002). The case study therefore seeks to provide a rich description and detailed explanation of the reason behind a complex phenomenon, and why they have happened or remained as they are. The case study is a more appropriate methodology for evaluating the RIS because it provides more detailed information comparatively to the other methods. This information gathered from individual cases can be compared to find out why the differences exist. It also allows researchers to collect data from multiple methods such as surveys, interviews, and observations among others that can be validated through triangulation.

They used this methodology to study 16 Small and Medium Scale enterprises (SMEs) from the UK and US (8 SMEs in the UK, and 8 SMEs in the US). They used the firm level case study to compare these firms and generated data from semi-structured interviews with Chief Executive Officers of these companies. Their study found out that, the bulk of firms were <10 years old, but their global customer base indicated that they were innovative firms as they have started exporting their products contributing to the regional economies supporting the empirical evidence that innovative firms are very important in economic development (Siegel et al. 2003) .",

Regression analysis allows researchers to identification and classification of relationships among multiple components (Schneider et al. 2010 ). This technique has become a key to economic statistics and it's mainly used to achieve several objectives like predicting, forecasting, and finding the effect of one causal variable on another (Sykes 1993 ). Regression analysis is preferred among statisticians because it allows users to make assumptions and it easily solves problems that are very complicated of because this method is very flexible (Oliver 2014 ). There are many types of regression techniques. The basic ones include linear regression, nonlinear regression, and the least squares method. According to Schneider et al.

The regional innovation strategies were created in all Czech regions (NUTS 3), i.e. documents in which the strategy how to create and promote RISs are contained.

Therefore, the degree to which they have been achieved increases the likelihood of positive effects being created when an RIS exists in a given region. For example, these effects can be observed via an increase in regional GDP or a decrease in the unemployment rate.

They only describe the physical substance of the RIS and can be used as a binary variable (whether present or not) or to quantify the number of institutions. The third group consists of characteristics that have a quantitative nature or contain characteristics whose quality significantly depends on the scope and quality of the individual RIS (typically, the number of patents). On the basis of their analysis, we can conclude that an existing RIS leads to cooperation, knowledge spillovers and a synergic effect and, thus, the creation of innovation. This type of RIS will have a positive impact as a result of the public interventions that have been created and supported. It is logical that each characteristic will not have the same meaning for RIS existence and operation.

On the other hand, the use of this method has some drawbacks in that it does not show the effects resulting from each characteristic. It only gives the accumulated value for the effects of each indicator. Furthermore, using such a method requires the weighting vector to be expressed numerically. The results derived from the use of the WSM can be authenticated by the use of another multi-criteria evaluation of the alternative. This method consists of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for validating results and is appropriate because it works on the same principle as the WSM, and its results are easy to compare. The use of the AHP method provides more detailed values than the WSM. On the other hand, the application of the AHP makes it easier to evaluate the degree of RIS advancement.",
