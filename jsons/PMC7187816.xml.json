Clinical and biological predictors are needed for identifying severity of COVID-19 infection and helping in judicious allocation of limited resources. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, and has also been associated with worse outcomes in patients with influenza and bacterial pneumonias.1, 2, 3 Emerging data have linked the presence of CVD with a worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients.4, 5, 6 Likewise, COVID-19 is associated with a high inflammatory, inducing vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias,5 which in turn can aggravate the damage to the heart.4 However, a few and scattered studies, with widely varying results, have been published so far. The small sample size of patients with a previous CVD history in these studies further limits its applicability. Thus, we aimed to compile and analyse all results recently published on the influence of CVD in the severity of COVID-19 infection. To this end, we carried out a pooled analysis of current studies and evaluate the association between underlying or previous history of CVD conditions and outcomes of infection severity in COVID-19 patients.",

No language restriction was made. When the articles were published by the same study group and there was an overlap of the search period, only the most recent article was included to avoid duplication of data. The PubMed function \"related articles\" was used to extend the search. Also, we searched major infectious disease, cardiovascular and general medicine journals reporting articles about COVID-19 infection to look for additional studies. We then performed hand-search of the bibliography of included studies, to detect other potentially eligible investigations.",

The strength of association between pre-existing CVD and COVID-19 severity and mortality was estimated using odds ratio (OR). A random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) was applied due to the heterogeneity in definition of CVD amongst the studies. The magnitude of heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the chi-squared test (Chi2) and I-squared statistic (I2). For the Chi2 test, a Cochrane's Q p value of <0.10 was considered significant. The values of the I2 statistic were interpreted as follows at a 95% confidence interval: 0\u201340% might not be important, 30\u201360% might indicate moderate heterogeneity, 50\u201390% may represent substantial heterogeneity, and 75\u2013100% may represent significant heterogeneity (37). Subgroups were used to compare cohort vs case-control studies. Publication bias was assessed by a funnel plot analysis. A random effects meta-regression using log OR was performed to evaluate the impact of baseline characteristics (age and sex) on association of CVD with disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, leave-one out sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results, and to further probe the sources of inter-study heterogeneity.",

Careful evaluation of the patients was performed in order to avoid an overlap between studies. We did not use any exclusion criteria due to the small number of studies. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were performed to assess for heterogeneity. Since age and sex can be a significant confounding variable, we performed a meta-regression to assess the impact of mean age on disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
