Experience from other diseases shows that there may be racial and socioeconomic disparities in the frequency and consequences of common bacterial infections [7\u20139] and the risk of antibiotic resistance [4, 10] between different racial and socioeconomic groups. Additionally, the risk of antibiotic resistance in patients with cirrhosis varies across continents and countries, demonstrating the need for tailored preventative and treatment strategies [4]. Urban safety-net hospitals provide care for many low-income and uninsured patients and a disproportionate share of the care of minority patients and immigrants, particularly recent or undocumented immigrants [11\u201313]. Although the nature of infections among patients with cirrhosis in general is well described, specific differences in the nature of infections and associated outcomes among patients presenting to safety-net hospitals are largely unexplored.",

When available, we also documented the presence or absence of antibiotic resistance. We categorized infections as present on admission if they were identified during the initial hospital assessment or in the case of occult infections, if signs or symptoms at the time of admission were attributable in retrospect to an infection that was only identified later in the hospital course. We also recorded the incidence of nosocomial infections, i.e., those arising at least 48 h into the hospital stay and not believed to be present upon admission [18].",

As with any retrospective study, these data are subject to missingness and mischaracterization in the medical record. The absence of a prospective protocol requiring resistance testing or proactive patient follow-up, for example, could have caused underestimation of the rate of antibiotic resistance or 30-day readmission or mortality not occurring within a participating center. For a key covariate, i.e., MELD\u2013Na, we have used a robust imputation method [21] to account for missing data to help offset this limitation.

We did not observe a difference in the incidence of infection on admission based on patient demographic factors. Infections on admission were associated with multiple key negative outcomes including greater short-term mortality (in-hospital and 30-day) and incidence of ICU admission and ACLF, as well as longer length of stay. Nosocomial infections were relatively uncommon overall (4%), but more common among patients admitted to the ICU. Antibiotic resistance was common (38%), but not clearly associated with an increase in key negative outcomes. Overall, our results demonstrate the critical role of infections in morbidity and mortality among patients with cirrhosis, as well as the need for increasing attention to the issue of antibiotic resistance.",
