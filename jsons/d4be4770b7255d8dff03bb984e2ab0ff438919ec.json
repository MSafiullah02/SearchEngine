Of these, only one was a Malaysian who had visited Wuhan for the Chinese New Year festival as his mother originated from Wuhan. The patients were mostly asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. Case 1 was asymptomatic until day 17 when fever and diarrhoea occurred. Nevertheless, the child's swabs were negative at that time. Case 2 had intermittent fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Case 3 was asymptomatic throughout. Case 4 had a mild cough and wheeze that responded well to salbutamol inhaler. None of the children required treatment with anti-virals. It is unknown why children with COVID-19 appeared to have milder disease. The adults may be more susceptible due to pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease or smoking which could weaken their ability to ward off infections. The adults may also be more susceptible to an immune overdrive that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mild or asymptomatic presentation in children may have impacted on infection control as they could be missed by existing surveillance. Further research needs to be carried out on the paediatric population to explore this matter.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 146, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"text": "There were issues regarding the care of paediatric cases that should be highlighted. Firstly, should an infected child under quarantine be separated from parents who were tested negative? Case 1 and Case 4 were brothers who were quarantined with their grandmother who was tested positive and their mother who was initially tested negative but later tested positive. The mother was advised regarding the high risk of being infected but she insisted on being quarantined together with her mother in law and children. Even though the patients were given masks, they may not have fully complied with the proper protocol. Case 2 was quarantined together with a younger sibling and parents who were well and had negative swabs for COVID-19 throughout their stay. The CDC guidance for the prevention and control of influenza in the peri-and post-partum settings recommends temporary separation of an ill mother and her child. [2] However, this separation may lead to a negative impact on both the child and the mother. The CDC states that the risks and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f benefits should be discussed with the mother and decisions made in accordance with the mother's wishes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 919, "end": 922, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"text": "Secondly, there are difficulties to obtain respiratory samples from paediatric patients.

However, some of the throat and nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive in Case 1 and Case 4 turned negative in testing and later reverted to positive. [ Table 2 ] The early negative results were likely false negatives from sampling error due to difficulty in obtaining respiratory specimens from this age group. It may be necessary to have three consecutive negative swabs before considering the patient to be fully recovered. The RT-PCR cycle threshold [CT} value gives an estimate of the viral load where the lower the CT value, the higher the viral load. There has been an expert consensus statement from China on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 on the 7 th of February 2020. [4] Most of the measures taken in these 4 cases agreed with the statement except for traditional treatments that were not used in our hospitals.
