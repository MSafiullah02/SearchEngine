Most current and past molecular surveillance studies of animal diseases investigated spatio-temporal and evolutionary dynamics of the viruses in a disjointed analytical framework, ignoring many uncertainties and made joint conclusions from both analytical approaches. Phylodynamic methods offer a uniquely integrated platform capable of inferring complex epidemiological and evolutionary processes from the phylogeny of viruses in populations using a single Bayesian statistical framework. In this study, we reviewed and outlined basic concepts and aspects of phylodynamic methods and attempted to summarize essential components of the methodology in one analytical pipeline to facilitate the proper use of the methods by animal health researchers. Also, we challenged the robustness of the posterior evolutionary parameters, inferred by the commonly used phylodynamic models, using hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) segments of the currently circulating human-like H3 swine influenza (SI) viruses isolated in the United States and multiple priors. Subsequently, we compared similarities and differences between the posterior parameters inferred from sequence data using multiple phylodynamic models. Our suggested phylodynamic approach attempts to reduce the impact of its inherent limitations to offer less biased and biologically plausible inferences about the pathogen evolutionary characteristics to properly guide intervention activities. We also pinpointed requirements and challenges for integrating phylodynamic methods in routine animal disease surveillance activities.",

            "text": "In the past few decades, genetic analysis of rapidly evolving pathogens has become an integral part of animal disease surveillance systems worldwide (1) (2) (3) (4) . Most current and past molecular surveillance studies of animal disease pathogens of both public health and economical importance such as influenza (5) (6) (7) , foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) (8) (9) (10) , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) (11) (12) (13) viruses are dependent on classical epidemiological and phylogenetic methods. These studies or surveillance systems used classical phylogenetic methods, including parsimony, neighbor-joining, or maximum likelihood (ML) approaches to either genotype novel emerging strains, classify viral lineages, or assess tree topologies to distinguish between novel and emerging strains (6, 7, 13) . In addition, classical phylogenetic approaches were used to assess correlations between the similarities of nucleotide sequences and related epidemiological characteristics, while ignoring uncertainties associated with estimates of phylogenetic relationships, host, temporal, and spatial factors (7, 10, 11, 14) . Furthermore, they investigated spatio-temporal and evolutionary dynamics of the virus isolates in a disjointed analytical framework and made joint conclusions from both analytical approaches (7, 10, 11, 14) . Therefore, many of the past and current molecular surveillance studies of animal diseases have ignored that epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of rapidly evolving viruses occur on approximately the same time-scale (15) . Thus, studying them in a unified analytical framework will refine their interpretations and limit biased conclusions to subsequently improving the related molecular surveillance activities. Classical phylogenetic approaches are not capable of accounting for the uncertainties in evolutionary processes of rapidly evolving pathogens or integrating related epidemiological features into their phylogeny, which is an important advantage of Bayesian phylodynamic methods.",

            "text": "The Bayesian phylodynamic methods were borrowed from the field of evolutionary biology and have become a powerful tool for exploring the evolutionary epidemiology of infectious pathogens (14) (15) (16) (17) . During the last two decades, the rapid growth of pathogens' genetic data and computational resources increased the applications of phylodynamic methods in animal and human disease surveillance (17) . These methods are capable of accounting for uncertainties, and uniquely integrate complex epidemiological and evolutionary processes in populations using a single Bayesian statistical framework (18, 19) . This framework handles the parameters of the phylodynamic model as random variables, in which each parameter is set by a specified prior probability distribution (and a parallel inferred posterior probability distribution). Therefore, this innovative quantitative integration improved disease investigation by answering novel epidemiological questions about the evolutionary history, spatiotemporal origins, within and between-host transmission, and environmental risk factors for rapidly evolving pathogens (17) . In fact, during the last decade, phylodynamic models have become well-established tools for studying the evolution of animal viral diseases specially influenza (20) , FMD (17) , and PRRS (21) . Besides, several studies advocated for the integration of phylodynamic methods in the routinely molecular surveillance pipelines of animal diseases with the objectives of reclassifying viral genotypes, distinguishing between emerging and endemic viral strains, and selecting proper vaccine strains (17, (21) (22) (23) . These approaches will provide a robust platform for guiding the allocation of resources within a surveillance system, for example, targeting emerging strains with higher evolutionary rates or hosts at high risk of generating new strains, which subsequently will reduce the economic costs of sampling, control, and prevention activities. Phylodynamic methods are implemented in many open-source statistical software packages, while the most popular user-friendly software package is formally known as Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling tree (BEAST) (24) .",

            "text": "While past studies illustrated the great potential of phylodynamic tools, the methods are sensitive to the density and coverage of sequence sampling, selection of genetic regions, quality and quantity of the associated surveillance data, and prior selection for the evolutionary parameters (15, 25, 26) . These limitations may result in biased posterior inferences, which subsequently lead to inaccurate or biological implausible conclusions about the evolutionary epidemiology of the pathogen under study (e.g., false divergence time or geographical origins). That said, most phylogenetic studies suffer from these inherent limitations. However, setting a thorough phylodynamic analytical pipeline, while acknowledging these limitations, can reduce their impact on the resulting posterior inferences and their related conclusions. Unfortunately, many published phylodynamic studies ignored such limitations, particularly in their analytical approach, in which they used simple na\u00efve priors for their evolutionary parameters while ignoring the underlying assumptions for these priors (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) . For example, prior selection should adhere to the assumption that different pathogens have unique evolutionary characteristics (14) , and therefore, using the same simple prior on different pathogens will likely lead to the conclusion that such pathogens behaved similarly during their evolutionary history. Also, these studies ignored the impact of selecting different prior models on their posterior evolutionary inferences of the pathogen under study (26, 32) . For example, the use of different prior models often leads to different conclusions about the geographical origins of the pathogen under study, and hence, Bayesian model selection is a critical step in phylodynamic analysis pipelines (25, 33) .",

However, few studies raised concerns about the sensitivity of the results to the choice of different evolutionary models (20, 26) as well as suggested a focused phylodynamic analytical pipeline for animal disease molecular surveillance (37) . Here, we demonstrate the basic principles for building a phylodynamic analytical pipeline, illustrate examples on the impact of gene segment and prior selection on the posterior evolutionary inferences, and highlight the prospects of the methods in improving animal disease surveillance. We selected a publicly available dataset compromising of 352 full genome sequences for human-like H3 swine SI collected as part of the United States Department of Agriculture influenza surveillance system between 2015 and 2018 as a working example. We provided a detailed description of a classical phylodynamic analytical pipeline encompassing both demographic and discrete phylogeographic reconstruction of the human-like H3 virus using BEAST. Our phylodynamic analyses included comparisons between commonly inferred evolutionary posterior parameters (e.g., substitution rate/site/year, divergence times, phylogeographic root state posterior probabilities, significant dispersal route between states) under different combinations of node-age and branch rate prior models. Furthermore, we extended this analytical pipeline into comparing posterior parameters inferred from HA and PB2 gene segments. Interpretation of the resulting posterior inferences under different scenarios, described above, has been discussed in detail, and we highlighted examples of their misuse in past phylodynamic studies. Our results identified the prospects and limitations of the presented phylodynamic pipeline in the context of animal disease surveillance on regional and global scales. Furthermore, our results provide researchers and stakeholders of the swine industry in the United States valuable insights on decisions related to the sampling and sequencing of the influenza virus genome when conducting future phylodynamic studies and improving the design of currently implemented surveillance systems.",

The first direction involves primary data analyses of novel sequences, in which they are either part of a designed study to identify the evolutionary characteristics of newly emerging viral strains (27, 37, 39) or part of an ongoing active surveillance program (40) . This direction usually includes the collection and sequencing of novel viral isolates from ongoing outbreaks. The second direction involves secondary data analyses of sequence collections published in publicly available genomic databases such as the Genbank, to mainly explore the evolutionary history of specific pathogens either on regional or global scales (38, 41, 42) . Secondary Frontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org sequence analysis can either target all available viral isolates or specific well-defined lineages (i.e., monophyletic clades) (38, 41, 42) . To reduce the impact of sampling bias on the results of a phylodynamic analyses, it is essential to ensure the representativeness of the viral isolates under study to the available sequences data on both temporal and spatial scales. This step is most important for primary sequence analyses, in which the dataset under study needs to cover all close relatives of novel viral isolates published elsewhere. Retrieving and combining relatives of novel viral isolates in a single dataset will warrant a proper inference of representative phylogenetic relationships of a tree topology based on all available related sequences. As on many occasions, novel sequences might belong to different distinct viral lineages published elsewhere (39, 43) . The basic local alignment search tool (BLAST; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) is the most popular tool for retrieving relatives of novel sequences (Figure 1) . Finally, the retrieval process should include complete and near-complete sequences to avoid distorting the phylogenetic relationships between the novel and the related isolates.",

Therefore, the thorough preparation of sequence metadata, which includes retrieval of information related to the isolate under study, is another critical step for a sound subsequent phylodynamic analysis. Sequence metadata can be retrieved either from public genomic databases such as the Genbank or from the related published literature. Because phylodynamic methods largely depend on time-stamped data, this step starts with retrieving the data of collection for the viral isolates under study. Thus, viral isolates with no temporal data are typically excluded from the analyses pipeline. Next, the date of collection is converted into BEAST readable format known as fractional years to estimate divergence times. For example, a virus collected on April 14, 2017, is converted into \"2017.282\" as a fractional year, where \"2017\" is the year of collection, and \"0.282\" is the number of days from the beginning of that year till the day for sequence collection divided by the total number of days within a typical year. Additionally, dates can be imported to BEAUTi by a separate text file that include the complete date of sequence collection with explicit separators (e.g., -or /). However, in many instances, the complete date of collection is not available, in which it misses either the exact date or month of collection. Therefore, we can either specify the age of the isolate as the mid-point of the corresponding month or year, respectively. Other epidemiological characteristics such spatial or host information can be prepared in a separate text delaminated format with unique identifiers that link them to the isolates in the sequence dataset. Isolates missing a none-temporal information should be kept in the analyses and are usually labeled with a question mark \"?\" to represent a missing information. In the context of the phylodynamic field, epidemiological characteristics such as country or host of origin are defined as a discrete trait and are described in more detail in the Running and Selecting Phylodynamic Models section. However, careful selection of these characteristics is recommended to be considered at the beginning of the analyses pipeline as a critical part of the data preparation for the subsequent analyses. Geographical discrete traits can be defined as the country of origin where the pathogen was isolated or can be redefined on smaller or larger spatial scales such as administrative regions within a country (44) or continental scale (32) , respectively, depending on the study's hypothesis. Besides the host of origin, other non-spatial discrete traits such as host and environmental attributes can also be defined as discrete traits (45) .",

It is worth noting that alignment uncertainty, for example, in terms of the choice of alignment algorithm can affect the subsequent phylogenetic inferences, such as tree topology (46) . However, the impacts of alignment uncertainties have not been reported with simple pathogens like viruses, mainly when dealing with small gene segments. Therefore, this issue might be considered when dealing with whole genomes or with more complex pathogens like bacteria and fungi, which can be resolved by multiple sequence alignment averaging using different alignment algorithms (47) . Common alignment algorithms include CLUSTAL (48) , T-coffee (49) , and MUSCLE (50), while AliView is a user-friendly graphical interface that can deal with large sequence datasets and integrate multiple alignment algorithms (51) . Performing the multisequence alignment using an algorithm, and manually deleting the gaps within the translated alignment, are the most common steps for most phylogenetic studies (51) . Also, confirming the reading frame of each gene segment (excluding the 5 \u2032 UTR) by examining the amino acid translation is another step within the MSA procedure. This step is commonly done, for example, for influenza virus HA and PB2 gene segments, and potentially for segments 7 and 8, to account for the frameshifted M2 and NS2 genes. However, it is worth noting that this step is only important for partitioned nucleotide models, described below.",

However, when assuming that the evolution rate is equal to zero, the invariant site (I) model is combined with the corresponding substitution model (69) . Selection pressure in protein-coding genes of rapidly evolving pathogens, in terms of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions, usually occurs at high rates (70) . This evolutionary phenomenon can affect estimates of divergence time and, therefore, need to be accounted for when selecting a substitution model (71) . Partitioning the gene segment into unique codon positions and assigning different substitution and site model combinations can accommodate the differences in the evolutionary dynamics within gene segments of the pathogen under study (70, 72) . Different substitution, sites, and codon partitioning models are implemented in many ML software packages as well as in BEAST. However, selecting the most realistic substitution/site model and partitioning scheme for the sequence data can be statistically achieved using either Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (73), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), or the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) (74, 75) . These ML-based statistical methods are wellimplemented in both PartitionFinder (76) and jModelTest (77) . Yet, a more robust Bayesian method for selecting a site model and an associated substitution model is implemented as an add-on package in BEAST 2.X (78) .",

When assuming that the substitution rate across the branches is uniform over the entire tree, then the molecular clock model is defined as strict. However, changes in the rate of evolution of rapidly evolving pathogens usually differ between the subtrees of its inferred phylogeny, and therefore, relaxed branch-rate models account for the variation in the rate of molecular evolution from clade to clade across the branches of the tree (79) . Substitution rates across branches are assumed to be either autocorrelated (80) (i.e., substitution rates are dependent) or uncorrelated (81) (i.e., substitution rates are independent). The uncorrelated branch-rate prior commonly used for rapidly evolving viruses, in which the branch rates are drawn either from exponential or log-normal parent distribution (81) . Another alternative to the strict clock model is local molecular clocks, which can estimate different rates for different predefined branch groups within a tree (82) . However, for large datasets, the manual task of assigning branches to different groups is impractical (81) , and therefore, Bayesian random local clocks can nest a series of local clocks with each extending over a group of branches within the full phylogeny (83) .",

Kingman's n-coalescent theory (i.e., node-age model) is the first stochastic model framework aimed at estimating the size of the sequences' population (85) . The theory describes the distribution of coalescent times in the phylogeny as a function of the size of the population from which the sequences were drawn (85) . Hence, in the past few decades, the coalescent theory is the core of phylodynamic methods and has shown to be the most useful for inferring essential parameters that shapes the evolution and population dynamics of evolving populations including their effective size (86), rate of growth (87), structure (88), recombination, and reticulate ancestry (89) . Expanding the temporal frame of sampling times is the ultimate approach for increasing the statistical power and precision of the coalescent model in estimating substitution rates and population demographics of rapidly evolving viruses (90) . An essential evolutionary parameter estimated from the coalescent model is effective population size (N e ) at a specific time (t) and interpreted as the natural population that represents sample genealogies that have statistical features of an idealized population size through time N e (t) (84) . However, such interpretation is only suitable for a non-recombinant single population, whereas complex populations with more frequent recombination events require the use of structured tree models (84) described in the following section.",

These models treat each coalescent interval as a separate segment to represent a parameter for population size in a given time, in which the number of segments can be specified by the investigator to generate a sky plot (93) . The piece-wise constant Bayesian skyline (BS) is the simplest non-parametric model, which assumes that the effective population size is experiencing an episodic stepwise changes through time (93) . However, the BS model is shown to be very sensitive to the total number of change points (i.e., coalescent intervals) when specified as a prior as well as to the number of sequences sampled at each point of time (94) . Hence, a Gaussian Markov random fields Bayesian Skyride (GMRF) was proposed as an alternative model to BS (95) . The GMRF model is less sensitive to the prior number of change points because it implements a temporal smoothing approach to recover accurate population size trajectories (95) . However, an improved version of the GMRF is the Skygrid (SG), which takes into account mutation parameters of multi-locus sequences (33) . The SG provides a more realistic estimate of demographic history in terms of population size and divergence times, as well as flexibility in terms of the ability to specify cut-points to the time trajectories (33) . Furthermore, the SG model is the least sensitive to the temporal distribution of sequences (33) . A notable example of sky plots utility in PRRS virus molecular surveillance in the United States was demonstrated by Alkhamis et al. (21) and Alkhamis et al. (37) . Their sky plot inferred a distinctly high genetic diversity through time for the emerging 1-7-4 RFLP-type PRRV virus (37), while inferred consistent seasonal increases and decreases in the relative genetic diversity through time for endemic strains isolated between 2014 and 2015 (21) .",

The most notable implementation of a migration model was developed by Lemey et al. (97) using a CTMP to infer H5N1 avian influenza virus's global origins and movements between countries. They used countries from which the sequences have been sampled as discrete traits to estimate migration rates between pairs of predefined sets of geographical locations, and therefore, the method is named discrete phylogeography (97) . Also, the method is known as discrete trait analysis (DTA) because it has the flexibility to use any other discrete trait such as host or farm characteristics from which the sequences have been isolated to model migration rates between infected hosts and farms (37, 98) . Besides, the method can infer ancestral origins (i.e., from the assigned discrete traits) for the internal nodes of the phylogeny through their estimated root state posterior probabilities (RSPP) (97) . However, the most notable feature of discrete phylogeographic models is the integration of a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure to identify significant viral dispersal routes between geographical regions or host species (97) . BSSVS can also infer the significance of the directionality in the migration process between pairs of discrete traits through integrated symmetric and asymmetric substitution models. The symmetric (Sym) model assumes that the transition rate from state \"A\" to \"B\" is the same as the transition rate from state \"B\" to \"A\" (i.e., directional spread between traits is insignificant), while the asymmetric (Asym) model assumes that the transition rate from state \"A\" to \"B\" is different from the transition rate from state \"B\" to \"A\" (i.e., directional spread between traits is significant) (97) . However, the lack of a sufficient number of sequences closer to the root of the phylogeny can impact accurate estimation of ancestral traits (i.e., ancestral geographical location or host) by the DTA method (97) . Therefore, DTA robustness can be improved by increasing the geographical density and temporal depth of sampling (96) . DTA is also limited by the type and number of variables that can be used to estimate ancestral states. Therefore, the BSSVS framework has been extended to accommodate a transitional rate matrix between discrete traits as a generalized linear model (GLM) (22, 32) . The method improves biological plausibility of the inferred RSPP for the ancestral traitsby simultaneously estimating the inclusion probabilities of geographic, demographic, and environmental predictors (22) . However, the method is shown to be more sensitive to sampling bias than the standard BSSVS approach (32) . Hence, comparative sensitivity analyses to sampling bias between the approaches are recommended to avoid severely biased inferred RSPPs.",

For inferring viral demographic history, our suggested pipeline (Figure 1 ) leads to the generation of eight phylodynamic model combinations for a single gene segment, including the selected substitution model (by PartitionFinder), two branch rate priors (UCED and UCLN), and four node-age priors (Cp, Ex, Exg, and SG). However, when inferring phylogeographic history using DTA, we suggest exploring both Sym and Asym BSSVS models (Figure 1) , which will lead to the generation of 16 models. Our rigorous analytical pipeline is indeed timely and computationally demanding, but on the other hand, it will lead to the selection of the most realistic model that fits the sequence data with confidence. However, this suggested pipeline is not a strict set of procedures that will ensure appropriate inferences, and therefore, researchers may explore other model or analytical pipelines relevant to their evolutionary hypotheses. It is worth noting that the computational efficiency has been substantially improved in BEAST version 1.10 and the accompanied software library Broadplatform Evolutionary Analysis General Likelihood Evaluator (BEAGLE; permits flexible parallel computing) when compared to earlier versions. The fit of the sequence data to the most realistic phylodynamic model can be assessed through simultaneous estimating the marginal likelihood (MLL) using the path sampling (PS) (25) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) (109) implemented in BEAUti using the standard settings (i.e., simulating across 100 samples for 1 million cycle from the posterior to the prior with a prior reflection point of Beta [0.3, 1.0]). The joint posterior probability density of the models' parameters is estimated by the MCMC algorithms. Setting the appropriate length of the MCMC chains (i.e., number of cycles) to ensure model convergence is dependent on the number of sequences in the dataset. One recommended approach is to quadratically increase the chain length relative to the number of sequences (e.g., 4 million states per sequence) (110) . Finally, creating duplicate runs from each generated model can aid in assessing the performance stability of the MCMC simulations and their MLL estimates.",

Besides, assessing the estimates of the effective sample sizes (ESS) for each parameter, in which ESS values >200, indicates good model convergence (111) . On some occasions, good model convergence does not ensure consistent parameter estimation due to the use of non-informative priors implemented in BEAUti. Therefore, it is critical to compare posterior parameter estimates (e.g., evolutionary rates, population growth rates, PS, and SS MLL estimates) between independent runs for each model to warrant that each parameter is closely identical to its duplicate run. In case of improper model convergence and inconsistent parameter estimation, it is recommended to either increase the length of the MCMC chain or the use of informative priors from previous MCMC runs for the same gene segment or pathogen.",

In this study, we revisited essential concepts and definitions within the field of phylodynamic methods. Also, we challenged the robustness of the posterior evolutionary parameters, inferred by the commonly used phylodynamic models, using two gene segments, of the currently circulating human-like H3 SI viruses isolated in the United States, and multiple priors. Subsequently, we compared similarities and differences between the posterior parameters inferred from HA and PB2 sequence data using multiple phylodynamic models. Hence, we explored the robust and sensitive aspects of SI phylodynamic models and highlighted the importance of model selection within their analytical framework. However, unlike classical phylogenetic methods currently implemented within the SI surveillance system in the United States, we were able to reveal higher resolution insights into the evolutionary epidemiology of human-like H3 viruses by quantifying their demographic and phylogeographic history. Therefore, animal health researchers and stakeholders need to be aware of the method's features, strengths, and limitations for generating reliable inference to guide future disease intervention activities properly.",

            "text": "Based on the results of the best fitting phylodynamic models for both HA and PB2 segments, evolutionary rates of currently circulating human-like H3 viruses in the United States remain high with no apparent signs of substantial declines (Figures 2B,D) and were similar to what was inferred elsewhere (117). Furthermore, inferred relative genetic diversity through time did not decline for the HA segment and showed evidence of seasonal variation between 2014 and 2018 (Figures 4A,B) , while a slight decline in the genetic diversity was inferred for the PB2 segment between 2015 and 2018 (Figures 4C,D) . These findings suggest that currently circulating human-like H3 viruses will continue evolutionary activity leading to the generation of novel strains, which is attributed to the frequent and continuous exchange of viruses between commercial and exhibition swine operations in the United States with the later as the epicenter of that exchange (117) . Our estimates of the TMRCAs for HA segment slightly agree on the notion that the oldest H3 viruses diverged from earlier outbreaks in the state of Minnesota, which is a central region for the swine industry in the United States (Figure 3) . However, the notable overlap in the inferred 95% HPDs of the TMRCAs between most states ( Figure 3B ) suggest that the currently circulating strains are shifting their evolutionary dynamics in terms of re-emergence and dispersal when compared to earlier strains. Additionally, both gene segments agree on the assumption that H3 outbreaks were recently introduced into the state of Maryland (Figure 3) . The state of Minnesota was inferred to be the ancestral location of human-like H3 viruses isolated from outbreaks observed between 2009 and 2012 (118) , which agrees with our TMRCAs inferred from HA segment (Figure 3) . However, results of the SG + UCLN symmetric model, selected as the best fitting model for HA sequence data (Supplementary Table 4) , implicates the state of Iowa as the ancestral region (after 2013) for currently circulating human-like H3 viruses, followed by the state of Minnesota as a secondary ancestral location ( Figure 5H ). This is not surprising since Iowa and Minnesota share the most prominent swine production system in the United States with the highest swine density, unrestricted and intense movement of animals between states. Although Iowa and Minnesota are the original hotspots of H3 viruses, our BSSVS BF results showed a markedly significant viral dispersal route between Indiana and Ohio (BF = 990) ( Figure 7H ). This suggests that the H3 viral gene flow between Ohio and Indiana, inferred for 2009-2012 viruses remains a vital migration route since, particularly within exhibition swine populations (117) . Even though Illinois and Indiana formulate one swine production system, there was no significant viral dispersal route inferred between the states. Despite the continuous nature of animal movement within the production system of Minnesota and Iowa, no significant dispersal route was inferred between the two states using the HA segment ( Figure 7H) . Nevertheless, using the PB2 segment, a highly significant dispersal route was inferred from Iowa to Minnesota, suggesting that Iowa might be the new epicenter for virus dispersal of the currently circulating H3 lineages ( Figure 8D ). This result is further supported by the significant migration route between Iowa on one side and Illinois and Ohio on the other when using the HA segment ( Figure 7H) . Also, the inferred dispersal route between Iowa and Illinois ( Figure 7H ) may reflect interstate movements of exhibition pigs (119) . Hence, the movements of exhibition pigs across the United States possibly led to expanding the spatial spread of H3 viruses to states with limited swine production systems (117) .",

Instead, this result demonstrates a homogenous spatio-temporal diffusion process of the PB2 gene between states (Figure 6D) , suggesting that the virus has maintained an endemic status across the United States after 2010. Also, results of the SG plot for PB2, described above, showed an overall stationarity in its genetic diversity through time (despite the slight early incline and later decline) (Figure 4C) , when compared to the HA gene (Figures 4A,B) , supporting the notion of endemic status. However, using the PB2 segment, we inferred a notably significant dispersal route originating from Iowa to Minnesota (BSSVS = 193) (Figure 8D) , reflecting a well-established swine transportation route within a production system, as described above. However, this route was not inferred as significant when using the best fitting model for the HA segment ( Figure 7H) . These results may be attributed to the fact that PB2 evolutionary dynamics are moderately slower than the HA segment (Figure 2 ) in terms of strength of the temporal signal (Supplementary Figure 2) , substitution rate (Figure 2) , and age of the segment (Figure 3) . Therefore, the PB2 segment maintained similar evolutionary dynamics to earlier strains that emerged in Minnesota and dispersed into Iowa (120) . Yet, both HA and PB2 segment agree on the importance of Iowa as a geographical region for dispersal of currently circulating H3 lineages (Figures 7H, 8D) . Additionally, we inferred two significant viral dispersal routes originating from Kentucky to Indiana and from Ohio to Indiana (Figure 8D) , which further supports the role of exhibition of swine movements between states in maintaining the spread of H3 viruses. Both dispersal routes are mainly maintained by the annual agricultural fairs where exhibition susceptible swine and humans from these states are frequently exposed to direct and indirect contacts from the same infected hosts (121) . It is worth noting that the route from Kentucky to Indiana was hypothesized to be important for H3 gene flow between states, but past evolutionary analyses did not observe it due to the lack of sufficient samples (117) .",

For example, the inclusion of many recent sequences from a single geographical location may lead to a biased bottleneck effect in the shape of inferred population size through time when using a coalescent model from the Skyline family (122) . This issue can be resolved by designing studies with uniform probability sampling with respect to space and time (122) . Further, setting DTA is user friendly and computationally more efficient when compared to more complex coalescent models, but it underlays a few assumptions, such as that the sequence sample size is proportional to the size of the selected discrete state (26) . Thus, including sequences from severely undersampled discrete traits will tend to produce unreliable posterior inferences, where for example, inferred RSPPs will be skewed toward oversampled areas. Nevertheless, undersampling is a common problem, especially in passive surveillance data, and therefore, the use of structural coalescent models (e.g., BASTA) might be more appropriate (26) .",

Although the largest number of collected sequences was in 2017 (80) (Supplementary Table 2) , estimates of relative genetic diversity through time did not show any striking jumps in that year for both HA and PB2 segments (Figures 4B, 2D) . Additionally, for the HA gene, Iowa (with 26 sequences) rather than Ohio (39 sequences) was inferred as the ancestral location ( Figure 5H, Supplementary Table 2) . However, seven out of the 17 U.S. states were excluded from the DTA due to the lack of sufficient sequences, and therefore, their role was unquantified in shaping the spatio-temporal evolution of SI. Yet, these states had substantially fewer swine-related activities as well as SI outbreaks than analyzed states.",

            "text": "Further, we showed how the posterior estimates of demographic reconstruction were almost insensitive to the choice of different phylodynamic priors for each gene segment (Figures 2-4) . However, inferred evolutionary estimates from different gene regions may differ (41) or coincide (118) due to the natural variation in their mutation rate over time. This raises the question of whether using longer gene segments or whole genomes provides deeper resolution into the evolutionary history of rapidly evolving pathogens. Past influenza A studies (41, 123, 124) , including the present study, showed that HA and NA segments typically exhibit higher evolutionary rates than more conserved segments like PB1 and PB2. Subsequently, segments with higher evolutionary rate will also display stronger evolutionary signals, as described above. In our analyses, the width of the 95% HPDs (i.e., length of the time scale) for the median age and TMRCAs of PB2 were remarkably wider than the HA segment (Figures 2, 3) . This sizeable width of the posterior intervals reflects the magnitude of uncertainty surrounding inferences from the PB2 segment, as well as suggests that inferences from the HA segment were more precise (or robust) than the PB2 segment. Also, we demonstrated how the PB2 segment failed to identify the ancestral geographical location of currently circulating H3 viruses ( Figure 6D) . While, using the symmetric model, we inferred four candidate ancestral locations with inconclusive RSPPs (Figure 6H) . Further, Nelson et al. (117) were not able to infer a significant migration route between Indiana and Ohio using the PB2 segment. Yet, we were able to infer this particular route as significant using both the HA and the PB2 segments (Figures 7H, 8D) . Additionally, Scotch et al. (118) confirmed agreements in the phylogeographic inferences between HA and NA gene segments. This highlights another decisive question about the suitability and efficiency of using single, multiple, or whole genome when using phylodynamic methods for molecular surveillance of viral diseases. Most researchers advocate for whole-genome analysis by either analyzing each segment alone or as concinnated segments.",

Besides, we can estimate the spatiotemporal dispersal speed of the virus as well as identify dispersal patterns (i.e., homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) across different geographical regions. Also, the use of GLM geographical models can directly quantify the importance of different environmental (e.g., climate) and demographical (e.g., pig density) factors in shaping the evolutionary history of SI in the United States.

This disjointed framework suffers from many biases and is not capable of answering more profound epidemiological questions about the outbreak of current dynamics. Using our suggested phylodynamic analytical pipeline, we were able to fulfill critical epidemiological questions about the emergence and evolution of currently circulating humanlike H3 SI viruses in the United States, with the primary goal of guiding risk-based surveillance resources. For example, using inferences from the HA segment, we were able to identify the dates of epidemic introduction to each state. Also, we were able to identify the geographic origins of the current outbreaks and observed their genomic-spatio-temporal diffusion process through time between states. Also, we identified highrisk viral dispersal routes between states, rank-ordered their significance, and defined their directions. All of these are integral components of an effective risk-based molecular surveillance program, and the ability to achieve in real time is the future molecular surveillance of animal diseases. Nevertheless, the availability of computational resources for designing an ongoing phylodynamic-based molecular surveillance system will always remain a challenge, especially for developing countries. That said, a few open-source software developed recently can perform basic phylodynamic analysis (e.g., estimate molecular clocks and infer evolutionary models) using an ML statistical framework, including TimeTree (130), treedater R package (131) , and Least Square Dating (120) .

The system updates the results of the MCC tree once new sequences are deposited in other web-based publicly available genomic databases. However, this project is achieved through rigorous and consistent global collaboration and data sharing. In the United States, resources for developing a similar system for tracing animal diseases are readily available. Nevertheless, the chain of collaboration between researchers, government, and producers in the animal sector is hard to maintain due to logistic, economic, and educational (i.e., lack of awareness and skill in phylodynamic methods) reasons. Nevertheless, recent scientific literature on the use of phylodynamic methods for animal disease surveillance is notably growing, which reflects the increased awareness between veterinarians about the capacities of such methods and the goodwill of the industry leaders to voluntarily share their data (37, 132) . Therefore, we anticipate a new era of animal disease prevention and control in the United States. In contrast, veterinary infrastructure in developing countries is severely lacking, in terms of reporting and data sharing, when compared to their human health sectors.

(A-D) Trees inferred from four node-age + asymmetric BSSVS priors. (E-H) Trees inferred from four node-age + symmetric BSSVS priors.",
