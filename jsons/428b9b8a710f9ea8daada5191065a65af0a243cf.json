Echocardiography at the end of the procedure revealed good biventricular function with a trace of aortic valve regurgitation. He was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit and extubated 8 hours later, initially without respiratory complaints. Based on our institution's protocol to identify and isolate admitted patients, SARS-CoV-2 screening via PCR (1) on naso-pharyngeal swab, taken on the first postoperative day was positive, with subsequent transfer to the COVID-19 Intensive Care unit. There was no fever and C-reactive protein (CRP) was only mildly elevated (45.later the patient was transferred to a monitored COVID-19 ward. Saturation was 97% on 4L of oxygen with limited respiratory complaints, which was not considered abnormal in the postoperative setting. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient developed low-grade fever with respiratory complaints consisting of dyspnea and dry cough. Pulse oximetry demonstrated decreased saturations of 90%. Imaging with both bedside chest X-ray and chest ultrasound showed pleural fluid. Biochemistry revealed a steep rise in CRP to 214 mg/l and slight elevation of ferritin to 308\u00b5g/L. The fluid was drained and was classified as exudate according to Light's Criteria (2) based on an elevated LDH pleural concentration (260 U/L). Based on the national guidelines at that time, a combination of hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was started empirically. Subsequently a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, revealing bilateral pleural fluid and several multiple ground glass opacification lesions with alveolar infiltration (Figure 3). On day 10, CRP peaked at 271mg/L with concomitantly increasing ferritin (500\u00b5g/L up to 610\u00b5g/L on day 12). Sputum culture revealed a Hemophilus influenzae. Further physiotherapy and oxygen through nasal cannula were administered together with a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and a 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The patient's status improved. CRP, ferritin and lymphocyte count were normalizing and there was no longer need for supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge, 14 days after the operation. The patient is actually home in self-isolation and follow-up in the COVID-19 outpatient clinic revealed a good clinical evolution without respiratory complaints and further trend to normalization of biochemistry. Comment The emerging pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 can further complicate life-threatening diseases. However, this case illustrates the surgical feasibility of acute aortic dissection treatment in patients with proven COVID-19 disease. Their postoperative course however is unpredictable and influenced by respiratory complications due to a possible combination of viral and bacterial infection. In this case, antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine treatment was initiated based on the national guidelines at that time, despite insufficient evidence-based data to support the latter. Reports of COVID-19 infection in cardiac surgery patients are rare. Hae He et al. described a case of aortic dissection, especially emphasizing the perioperative anesthetic precautions, without any details of the clinical course (3). In thoracic oncologic surgery, evidence suggests higher mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4).",
