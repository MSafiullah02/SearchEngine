This paper describes a spatio-temporal, stochastic, susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered process model that simulates the potential spread of classical swine fever through a documented, large and free living wild pig population following a simulated incursion. The study area (300 000 km 2 ) was in northern Australia. Published data on wild pig ecology from Australia, and international Classical Swine Fever data was used to parameterise the model. Sensitivity analyses revealed that herd density (best estimate 1-3 pigs km -2 ), daily herd movement distances (best estimate approximately 1 km), probability of infection transmission between herds (best estimate 0.75) and disease related herd mortality (best estimate 42%) were highly influential on epidemic size but that extraordinary movements of pigs and the yearly home range size of a pig herd were not. CSF generally established (98% of simulations) following a single point introduction. CSF spread at approximately 9 km 2 per day with low incidence rates (< 2 herds per day) in an epidemic wave along contiguous habitat for several years, before dying out (when the epidemic arrived at the end of a contiguous sub-population or at a low density wild pig area). The low incidence rate indicates that surveillance for wildlife disease epidemics caused by short lived infections will be most efficient when surveillance is based on detection and investigation of clinical events, although this may not always be practical. Epidemics could be contained and eradicated with culling (aerial shooting) or vaccination when these were adequately implemented. It was apparent that the spatial structure, ecology and behaviour of wild populations must be accounted for during disease management in wildlife. An important finding was that it may only be necessary to cull or vaccinate relatively small proportions of a population to successfully contain and eradicate some wildlife disease epidemics.",

Sus scrofa, commonly known as wild boar, feral pig, wild hog and wild pig (herein referred to as wild pig) is an important international wildlife species found on every continent except Antarctica [20] . Considerable research has been conducted internationally on wild pig ecology [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and this research can be harnessed to construct detailed process models to study disease epidemiology in this species. Wild pigs have been involved in the transmission or maintenance of many agriculturally important infectious trans-boundary diseases such as African swine fever [26] , pseudorabies [27] and footand-mouth disease [28] , as well as the spread of important endemic zoonoses such as Brucella suis [29] . Classical swine fever (CSF) is another important transboundary agricultural disease of domestic and wild pigs [30] . Outbreaks of CSF in Europe have cost many billions of dollars to eradicate [31] , and cause ongoing costs in areas where it is endemic. CSF also has a wide geographic distribution, being found in Asia, Europe, parts of Africa and central and South America [30] , but not Australia. Wild pigs are frequently important in the epidemiology of CSF [32] , but the issue is complex as demonstrated by Boklund et al. [33] who investigated the potential role of wild boar in CSF epidemics in Denmark.",

Kramer-Schadt et al. [36] conducted a review and used a conceptual model to putatively identify the reasons that CSF can persist in some populations. They found virulence of CSF and the size and structure of a wild pig population to be important.

It simulated the introduction of a virulent CSF virus into the population to explore epidemic behaviour, disease ecology and various epidemic control options. Three simulation models were developed. Model 1 was a non-spatial within-herd model in which the unit of interest was individual wild pigs (this model is summarised in Additional file 1; results are presented in Table 1 ). This model was simply used to estimate herd-based epidemiological parameters (i.e. convert individual parameters such as individual infectious period to a herd based parameter). These herd based parameters were then used in a betweenherd model (Model 2) which was the main focus of the paper. Model 2 simulated the spread of CSF across a population of wild pig herds in time and space. In Model 2, herds ranged from individual boars to a group of co-mingling wild pigs occupying a territory or home range. The logic of Model 2 was structured on the recommendations of Cowled and Garner [38] who stated that a number of factors should be accounted for during disease modelling in wild pigs, including distribution and habitat connectivity, density, movements, social and group structure and age structure. Model 3 was a non-spatial herd model designed to replicate model 2, except that model 3 assumed no spatial relationships between wild pig herds. Comparison between model 2 Table 1 Epidemiological parameters estimated for the between-herd model (parameters derived from the within herd model except arbitrary transmission probability) and 3 allowed consideration of the importance of spatial relationships during simulated epidemics. See Additional file 1 for a method summary of model 3.",

The Kimberley region is a large (approximately 300 000 km 2 ), remote and sparsely populated pastoral (cattle) region. Pigs were introduced by European settlers during the late 19 th century and subsequently became wild [39] . Questionnaire surveys were conducted across the Kimberley region to estimate wild pig distributions and densities and have been previously reported [40, 41] . Wild pigs are currently found across approximately 26 000 km 2 of the Kimberley region. The population chosen for disease introduction was located in the Fitzroy River area (see study area and introduction site in Figure 1 ). Other researchers have investigated the biology of wild pigs in the region [42] and the population structure was typical of other wild pig populations, for example with groups comprised mostly of solitary boars or herds containing adult females and juveniles [42, 43] . Average group sizes were generally small (mostly herds of 12 or less, but up to 30 pigs). In high density habitat, wild pigs may be present at approximately 3-8 pigs per km 2 (the range in density depending on whether an edge effect is taken into account) [42] .",

These polygons represented the core habitat of wild pigs in the study area. Thus, a 16 701 km 2 area of \"core\" habitat was identified in the overall distribution of wild pigs (of 26 000 km 2 ). This method was chosen to refine the distribution of wild pigs because the Kimberley region is a tropical ecosystem, is very hot (November mean maximum and minimum daily temperature are 41.0 and 25.6\u00b0C respectively [44] ), and in accordance with field observations it is recognised that wild pigs in these conditions require at least daily access to water for survival [24] . Saunders and Kay [45] demonstrated daily home range lengths of approximately 2 km, and it was therefore assumed that wild pig home ranges must be located within 2 km of permanent water for survival (that is, a large wild pig home range must contain some of this high quality water habitat). Permanent water was identified using a spatial dataset from Geoscience Australia [46] , with additional data layers of artificial water sources (stock water) supplied from the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (unpublished data).",

Thus the 16 701 km2 area was divided into three polygons of 7563 km 2 (low density), 469 km 2 (medium density) and 8639 km 2 (high density). Relative densities were then quantified using published estimates. Choquenot et al. [24] reviewed wild pig densities in various habitats in northern Australia. These ranged from 1-20 pigs km -2 . Twigg et al. [42] estimated 3 pigs km -2 within a high density region of this study site. Given our study site was in a semi-arid region it was assumed that densities would be at the lower end of the range listed in Choquenot et al. [24] . Thus, estimates used for population densities were 1, 2 and 3 pigs per km 2 in low, medium and high density pig habitat, respectively. Our upper estimate is thus consistent with an edge effect modified estimate from prior work in our study area [42] and consistent with the lower estimate of Choquenot et al. [24] .",

The remaining population was divided into social groups (female groups) with simulation using a B pert distribution of group sizes (minimum group size = 5, most likely = 7, maximum = 45) based on prior research on group sizes [24, 42] and allowing for a slightly greater range due to the limited size of the study in Twigg et al.

The time spent in each state is stochastically determined using probability distributions. The time step used in the model is one day. To represent disease transmission between herds it is necessary to consider the spatial distribution of the wild pig population (see sections below). Local herds have the chance of coming into contact where their daily home ranges overlap, and if one of these herds is infected then there is a probability of virus transmission between an infected and un-infected herd. In the absence of good field information, this probability was arbitrarily set at 0.75, with a thorough sensitivity analysis undertaken to determine how the model outcomes change in response to changes in this parameter. Figure  2 shows diagrammatically how disease transmission between a single infected herd and neighbouring susceptible herd occurs. In this way, CSF can spread through a wild pig population comprising contiguous herds. However, CSF (particularly virulent strains) frequently produces severe clinical disease [59] that could be expected to affect the activity of feral pigs [60] . To allow for this, when wild pig herds are in the infected state, their mobility is assumed to decline to just 10% of their normal daily movement and home range (but sensitivity analyses occurred) (see Figure 2 ). This limits the probability of overlapping home ranges and thereby reduces the chance of transmitting virus to nearby uninfected herds.",

Explanation: an infected herd (red square) and susceptible herd (blue circle) have overlapping daily home ranges (red and blue circles respectively). Classical Swine Fever transmission may occur according to an arbitrary probability. Following infection the incubating herd continues to move normally for several days (yellow dots) before becoming clinically affected (red dots) with shortened daily movements and eventually having all herd members killed (black cross). This infected herd does not contact another herd and CSF is not transmitted to another herd. core water habitat. In effect, this allowed a small proportion of pigs to disperse or display extraordinary movements. Giles [62] showed that groups of wild pigs can move 20-30 km during short periods in response to natural events such as flooding. Saunders and Bryant [64] showed that wild pigs can move from a study area in response to persecution, and that long range dispersal can occur. Caley [61] showed that a small proportion of wild pigs may move 20-30 km over several years (although the majority stay within their home ranges).",

The availability of control resources was measured by two parameters, the number of helicopters used for culling (4) and how many individual pigs could be culled each day (300) by each helicopter. The probability that a herd would be detected and culled during culling operations was user defined, with a default of 0.8 [64] , meaning that 80% of herds would be randomly culled during baseline model simulations.

It also provides some useful guidelines for containing and eradicating epidemics from widespread terrestrial vertebrate species such as the wild pig. The spatial structuring evident in the wild pig population in our study area [40] had a large influence on simulated epidemics. For example, in our simulations, epidemics typically travelled in waves along the larger river systems along which wild pig meta-populations were located (see Additional file 2). This spatial population structuring resulted in a very low daily incidence rate (< 2 herds each day). In contrast, epidemics in nonspatial populations progressed much more quickly (~61 herds per day). This occurred because epidemics were not confined to that proportion of the population in the immediate vicinity of infected herds during non-spatial simulations, but instead could infect herds randomly throughout the entire population. That is, models that do not take realistic spatial structures into account may overestimate the rate at which a disease will spread and overestimate the size of an outbreak.",

            "text": "The spatial nature of epidemics is of critical importance when planning surveillance for wildlife disease. Despite typical epidemics infecting thousands of wild pig herds, across thousands of square kilometres and lasting several years, the spatial structure of the population meant the number of currently infected herds was just a handful each day and new infections were limited to those herds directly adjacent to the narrow epidemic front. This highlights potential difficulties in attempting to detect active infection in wild populations using agent identification techniques (such as culture or PCR) in which no carrier state exists and immunity to an infectious agent is long lived (e.g. FMD and CSF in wild pigs). This is in accordance with prior research [73] . In addition, given the rapid turnover of individuals in many wild populations (especially wild pigs [74] ) the decline in herd immunity may be rapid, leaving a relatively narrow window to conduct even serological investigations. Taken together this suggests that surveillance based on detection and investigation of clinical events is likely to be an efficient approach to finding short lived infections. Alternatively, in situations in which passive detection and reporting cannot be relied upon (e.g. little or limited opportunity to observe the population) then a more structured surveillance approach would benefit from a very good understanding of risk to allow targeted and therefore efficient sampling. These simulation results also suggest that the spatial structuring and behaviour of wild animal populations should have an influence on the design of containment and eradication programs. Wild pigs are relatively sedentary with a high fidelity to a home range [61] ; only short daily movements are observed [45, 47] . Populations in Australia are also predictably associated with riverine habitat [40, 75] . Our findings indicate that epidemics would only spread relatively slowly across the landscape (~9 km 2 each day) and are containable with some relatively simple and well researched control methods such as aerial shooting [64] . An adequate design in our modelling was a control zone width of approximately 30 km around the infected area, in which 60% of herds could be culled (although other combinations of control zone width and proportions able to be culled were also adequate). Indeed, following simulated introductions of disease into the largest and highest density sub-population of wild pigs in the Kimberley region (Fitzroy River populations), disease could be eradicated by culling just a median of 419 herds per outbreak (representing approximately 11% of herds in the sub-population of interest -the Fitzroy River population).",

This was because culling was not targeted to the immediate vicinity of the epidemic but was randomly implemented across the wild pig population. This is likely the reason that our findings differ from those of earlier mathematical modelling studies in wild pigs indicating that very high culling levels (e.g. 95%) may be required over short time periods or that relatively high culling rates may be required for a number of years (e.g. 49% per annum) to eradicate a disease such as FMD in wild pigs [8] .

Specifically, in every culling or vaccination combination (width of control zone and proportion of herds culled or vaccinated), culling lead to smaller epidemics than vaccination (see Figure 6 ) (although slight differences in program implementation should be noted: namely vaccination occurred from the outside in, culling from the inside out). Additionally, infection was routinely contained at lower combinations of control zone width and probability in the culling scenarios than the vaccination scenarios (Table 6 c.f. Table 7 ). The reasons for this could include the time taken for immunisation to become effective, resulting in pig herds continuing to become infected and continuing to transmit disease during vaccination programs compared to culling (in which a proportion of pig herds are immediately removed from the population). The effectiveness of culling provides countries like Australia, where wild pigs are a damaging, introduced invasive species and where control is mandated, a great advantage for controlling disease in wild pig populations. In other continents such as Europe where wild boar are a valued endemic species and effective aerial culling may not be as acceptable, there is greater reliance on less effective tools such as vaccination. This may be equally true during outbreaks in domestic pigs, in which ethical concerns force consideration of vaccination over culling [77] .",

They found that attenuation of CSF viruses to moderate virulence, as well as the size and structure of wild boar populations may affect persistence, and recommended further spatially explicit modelling. Our modelling supports their hypothesis, with epidemics induced under assumptions of lower virulence resulting in longer and larger epidemics with higher cumulative incidences. However, in both low virulence and high virulence scenarios, without further introductions infection always died out after several years because as an epidemic front reached the end of a contiguous wild pig population there were insufficient susceptible hosts to maintain the infection. Infection could not spread back along the previous route of the epidemic because these herds had either died from CSF or were immune. These results concur with the majority of published studies investigating the nature of CSF outbreaks in European wild boar populations, in which CSF outbreaks generally fade out after several years [32, 50] .",

Our results suggest density, the daily linear distance a herd can move, the probability of herd death from CSF and the probability of transmission between herds can have a large influence on the size and scale of an epidemic. Addressing each of these in turn, it appears that density and daily movements are highly correlated. This indicates that at higher densities, or with greater daily movements, larger epidemics occur because infectious herds are more likely to come into contact with other susceptible herds. Arbitrarily increasing the probability of transmission also increased the size of epidemics for similar reasons. In contrast to this, as the probability that a herd will die following infection increased, epidemics declined in size. This was likely because herds were eliminated before they had a chance to transmit infection to nearby herds. However, having a small proportion of the population that are unrestrained by assumptions of home range fidelity or varying the size of a herd's annual home range made little difference to the overall scale of the epidemic. Several authors have found that Australian wild pigs have a high home range fidelity [61, 62, 78] , but have also found that a small proportion of pigs can move much greater distances and are unrestrained to home ranges [61, 62] . Based on these modelling results it appears that these individuals would have little influence on disease spread, potentially because the probability that one of these individuals is incubating disease is low, and because clinical impacts of CSF reduce long range, aberrant movements anyway.",

However, were human mediated movements found to be important for transmitting infection, it is likely that control and surveillance programs would be made considerably more difficult. Although there is no field or published evidence of wild pigs chronically infected with CSF [37] , Kramer-Schadt et al. [37] supposed that this may have been missed and assumed chronically infected pigs for the purposes of modelling. They used modelling to demonstrate that the existence of chronically infected wild boar may be a plausible mechanism to explain persistence of infection in a region. Other evidence [79] suggests that persistently infected piglets are critical in sustaining infection. Our modelling assumed chronically infected wild pigs, but only allowed for the longest recorded wild boar piglet infectious periods of 39 days, [80] which is shorter than has been recorded in domestic pigs [50] .",

Density, daily movement distances, disease-induced herd mortality rates and transmission probabilities between adjacent herds are also important. It is also evident that control and surveillance programs should account for the spatial structuring of wild populations, and that it may only be necessary to cull or vaccinate relatively small proportions of a population to successfully contain and eradicate wildlife disease epidemics.",
