Neyman and Ervin first performed a bench study demonstrating the technical feasibility of ventilating four patients with one ventilator and one modified circuit. 1 The same circuit configuration was used in 2008 by Paladino et al in an animal model, resulting in substantial differences in oxygenation and decarboxylation between subjects during the ventilation period. 2 In 2012 Branson et al tested in vitro the Neyman and Ervin system simulating different conditions of compliance and resistance between the simultaneously ventilated test lungs. They observed wide variability in measured tidal volume (Vt) and end-expiratory lung volume, so they concluded that the technique should be avoided because of potential danger. 3 Accordingly, the authors argued that the stockpiling of ventilators should be the firstline solution when massive emergencies are forecast; only after their depletion, strategies such as the 'double circuit' should be implemented for the shortest possible duration. 4 5 On 20 February 2020, the first case of Covid-19 emerged in the Lombardy region, northern Italy. As of 17 March, a total of 1069 patients had been admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, with a total of 1202 ICU beds available (after a significant expansion from the 720 beds available pre-crisis). 6 By this time, a potential problem of ventilator shortages began to emerge because of the further spread of the virus in other regions of Italy. Great efforts have been put into place by institutions and industries to provide more ventilators for hospitals, but there is still a high potential for a supply-demand mismatch.",

We set ventilation for two patients of 80 kg of predicted body weight (PBW) targeting 6 mL/kg Vt at a respiratory rate (RR) of 20/min with an inspiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:1 and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) of 100%. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 15 cmH 2 O and initial inspiratory pressure (Pinsp) at 10 cmH 2 O. We performed an initial 15 hour test with similar conditions between the two simulated patients (static compliance of the respiratory system (Cstat) 50 mL/cmH 2 O and airway resistance (Raw) 5 cmH 2 O/L/sec); in pressure control mode (Pinsp 11 cmH 2 O, PEEP 14 cmH 2 O, RR 20 beats/ min), measured delivered Vt was 953 mL, while the patients received 470 mL each.",

Clinical personnel must remain vigilant, in order to recognise any possible sign of hypoor overventilation, and must be ready at any time to start manual bag ventilation if any issue would occur. Compared with manual bag ventilation, our technique allows delivery of ventilation, PEEP and FiO 2 with reasonable accuracy, is safer for operators and avoids the need for additional human resources (no 'human ventilator' is constantly needed at the patient's head). Using one ventilator for two patients instead of four (as proposed by some authors) reduces possible logistical issues (bed and ventilator positioning) and problems related to inadequate patient size matching.",

However, for a clinical application of this 'extreme' technique, several other factors must be taken into account. Indeed, anthropometric features (body weight and body mass index), respiratory mechanics (lung and chestwall compliances, airway resistances, possible auto-PEEP), physiological variables (complete paralysis, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production) and the clinical course of the two connected patients play a major role in determining the quality and quantity of ventilation delivered to each patient. Moreover, monitoring respiratory mechanics in each patient would be impossible or very difficult; however, we cannot neglect the possibility that, besides technical and physiological factors, ethical dilemmas may also arise. 7 Indeed, the most difficult choice during such an emergency would be to either accept a grim triage reality (in which not all patients receive a ventilator) or accept the fact that trying to save two patients with one ventilator could mean harming at least one of them.",
