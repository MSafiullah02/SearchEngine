Although there is no vaccine or treatment for Zika virus disease, mortality rates are extremely low, and not all infected individuals display or even notice their symptoms. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, with symptoms usually mild in severity and lasting 3\u20137 days (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016). However, Zika has been linked to increased risk for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome as well as microcephaly among children born to mothers infected with the virus during pregnancy (Deckard et al., 2016).",

As of June 2016, 61 countries and territories reported active mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika virus, with the majority of global cases being documented throughout Latin America (WHO, 2016). Extensive news and media coverage of the Zika outbreak was followed by increased fear in the U.S. that the Zika virus might become a domestic pandemic. Despite public statements from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases assuring the public that risk of a major U.S. outbreak is low, concern among U.S. residents remains high (Santora, 2016).",

Cognitive-behavioral models of health anxiety posit that distress arises as a result of mistaken beliefs about illness, health, and the meaning of ambiguous body sensations (e.g., Abramowitz & Braddock, 2011; Taylor & Asmundson, 2004; Warwick, 1989). Specifically, threatening appraisals of somatic sensations (e.g., \u201cif I feel feverish, I might have Zika\u201d) trigger anxiety and worry, as well as urges to perform precautionary (i.e., safety) behaviors such as decontamination, reassurance-seeking, or avoidance of potential contaminants (e.g., Dorfan & Woody, 2011). Although these behaviors often reduce health-related anxiety in the short term, such relief is typically fleeting. Moreover, such behaviors have been shown to maintain and even exacerbate health anxiety for a long term (e.g., Deacon & Maack, 2008; Gangemi, Mancini, & van den Hout, 2012; Olatunji, Etzel, Tomarken, Ciesielski, & Deacon, 2011).",

Anxiety sensitivity refers to the propensity to misinterpret anxious arousal (or other ambiguous physical sensations) as dangerous (e.g., Taylor, Zvolensky, Cox, Deacon, Heimberg, Ledley, 2007). Individuals high in anxiety sensitivity are prone to self-monitor for unexplained body sensations (e.g., a hot flash) in an attempt to quickly detect and respond to potential threat. Indeed, previous research shows that anxiety sensitivity and body vigilance predict anxious responding to health status in general (e.g., Gerolimatos & Edelstein, 2012; Krautwurst, Gerlach, Gomille, Hiller, & Witth\u00f6ff, 2014; Schmidt, Lerew, & Trakowski, 1997), as well as to specific disease outbreaks (e.g., Blakey et al., 2015; Wheaton et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2011). It follows that someone who believes unexplained body sensations forecast medical catastrophe would continually monitor for bodily changes, detect them rapidly, misconstrue them as threatening (i.e., a symptom of Zika), and consequently experience anxiety.",

Such inconsistent findings might be due to diverse study methodology or sample idiosyncrasies. Another consideration is that the diseases studied previously (e.g., Avian flu, swine flu, cholera, Ebola) are qualitatively distinct. For example, whereas the Zika virus and Avian flu are primarily transmitted to humans via animals, a person may get cholera by drinking contaminated water, yet contract swine flu or Ebola through contact with human bodily fluids. Such meaningful differences between previously studied diseases (e.g., method of disease transmission) may have influenced the detected relationships between psychological constructs highlighted in etiological models and disease outbreak anxiety (e.g., Liao, Cowling, Lam, & Fielding, 2011).",

Furthermore, continued research in this area is needed to test the replicability and generalizability of previous findings to new participant samples and disease contexts. By investigating the consistency of psychological factors that may contribute to outbreak-related public distress, psychological models that seek to explain clinically significant health anxiety may be refined and updated. Clarifying the factors that contribute to health anxiety in the wake of global pandemics also may help clinicians identify individuals who might be vulnerable to exacerbated health anxiety-related symptoms (e.g., a patient with OCD who becomes increasingly distressed about contamination during an illness outbreak).",

Underscoring the severity of fear of Zika in the U.S., in April 2016, the U.S. government reallocated $510 million in funds that originally were dedicated to battling the Ebola virus, and redirected the funds toward containment of the Zika virus (McNeil, 2016). The present study was designed to identify which psychological factors predict health anxiety in response to the threat of a domestic Zika virus pandemic. Results partially supported our hypothesis; only contamination likelihood overestimates and factual knowledge emerged as significant unique predictors of Zika-related anxiety.",

However, whereas Blakey et al., (2015) found that likelihood overestimates were related to Ebola anxiety, findings from the present study highlight the unique relation between severity overestimates and Zika anxiety. It is possible that differences between diseases (e.g., in symptom profile, means of transmission, etc.) determine which predictor variables have greatest relevance for outbreak-specific health anxiety. Thus, diseases such as avian flu, swine flu, Ebola virus, and Zika virus may each generate somewhat different patterns of health anxiety. For example, whereas the Ebola virus was associated with low probability of contraction (for U.S. residents) and high symptom severity, the odds of a U.S. resident contracting Zika (the symptoms of which are generally mild and brief) were much higher during the time of data collection. Future studies of health anxiety specific to discrete pandemics should assess for beliefs about the outbreak (e.g., regarding contagion) in addition to factual knowledge about the disease itself.",

This finding was unexpected and highlights that information-seeking may be either adaptive (i.e., corrective information-gathering) or maladaptive (e.g., reassurance-seeking). Given the cross-sectional nature of our study, it is possible that some fearful participants coped with their Zika anxiety by seeking out knowledge and information about the disease, thereby obfuscating our hypothesized effect. In light of previous studies showing that information-searching (i.e., cyberchondria; Fergus, 2013) increases dramatically in the initial weeks after disease outbreak announcements are made (Tausczik, Faasse, Pennebaker, & Petrie, 2012), longitudinal research examining the relation between health anxiety and disease knowledge over time would be helpful. Future research also should consider whether one\u2019s perceived versus one\u2019s actual knowledge best predicts anxious responding to the threat of a disease outbreak. The possibility that perception of one\u2019s own knowledge is more strongly related to health anxiety than is one\u2019s own actual knowledge is consistent with previous research. Also related to this possibility is literature implicating the role of intolerance of uncertainty in the experience of health anxiety, i.e., the tendency to consider it unacceptable that a negative event could occur at all, however small its actual probability may be (e.g., Dugas Dugas, Gosselin, & Ladouceur, 2001; Fetzner, Asmundson, Carey, Thibodeau, Brandt, Zvolensky, & Carleton, 2014; Rosen & Kn\u04d3uper, 2009; Xie et al., 2011).",

Although this could merely be an artifact of our sample\u2019s idiosyncrasies or demographic makeup, these findings also might be interpreted to suggest that Zika fears are not driven by the same psychological factors that engender more generalized health anxiety or related conditions (e.g., OCD, illness anxiety disorder). The possibility that the cognitive-behavioral model of generalized health anxiety may not apply to fearful responding to discrete illness outbreaks is bolstered by the fact that only a few purported psychological predictors of health anxiety have been linked to anxious responding to outbreaks other than the Zika virus, i.e., outbreaks such as those involving avian flu (Liao et al., 2011), swine flu (Wheaton et al., 2012), and SARS (Xie et al., 2011). Our finding that generalized health anxiety was correlated with, but not predictive of, Zika anxiety is also interesting and suggests that anxious responding in the wake of discrete outbreaks is related to, yet distinct from, more generalized health anxiety. Future research should explore the degree to which certain psychological factors influence health anxiety in general as compared to health anxiety in response to specific illnesses in both clinical and nonclinical samples.",

Similarly, the cross-sectional design of this study precludes drawing conclusions regarding causality or temporal precedence. For instance, it is possible that individuals who overestimate the probability of becoming contaminated are more prone to be afraid of the threat of the Zika virus; alternatively, individuals experiencing Zika-related anxiety may come to believe that contamination was more likely than they had previously thought. Additional research utilizing a longitudinal and multimethod assessment design is needed to determine the risk factors of experiencing health anxiety in response to discrete disease epidemics.",
