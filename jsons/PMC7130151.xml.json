In November 2002, there were many cases of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology in Guangdong Province in southern China, with a high rate of transmission to health-care workers.5 A 64-year-old physician from southern China, who visited Hong Kong on February 21, 2003, and died 10 days later of severe pneumonia, is believed to have been the source of infection, causing subsequent outbreaks of SARS in Hong Kong,1\n6 Vietnam, Singapore,2 and Canada.3 The index patients of these cities had been exposed to the Guangdong physician while they were visiting China or had been staying on the same floor of the same hotel. While investigating the outbreak of SARS in Hanoi, Dr. Carlo Urbani unfortunately contracted the disease and died.",

The use of a jet nebulizer for administering bronchodilators to the index case, who presented clinically with community-acquired pneumonia, could increase the droplet load around the patient and, together with the overcrowding condition on the hospital ward, had contributed to this major hospital outbreak.1 A novel coronavirus (CoV) is now identified as the main pathogen responsible for SARS,8\n9\n10\n11 although the presence of a metapneumovirus also was inferred in studies from Canada11 and Hong Kong.1 Several laboratories have recently completed the sequencing of the genome of the CoV that has led to the global epidemic of SARS, and they have noted that the SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized CoVs.12\n13\n14\n",

In our study, the opacities occupy a peripheral or mixed peripheral and axial location in 88% of patients.18 The predominant involvement of the lung periphery and the lower zone, in addition to the absence of cavitation, hilar lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion, are the more distinctive radiographic features of SARS.1\n18 Radiographic progression from unilateral focal airspace opacity to either multifocal or bilateral involvement during the second week of the disease course, followed by radiographic improvement with treatment, is commonly encountered.1\n18 In one case series,1612% of patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 20% of patients developed evidence of ARDS over a period of 3 weeks. In general, the incidence of barotrauma in ICU admissions seems higher than expected despite treatment with low-volume and low-pressure mechanical ventilation.

The epidemiologic criteria include travel (including transit in an airport) within 10 days of the onset of symptoms to an area with current, recently documented, or suspected community transmission of SARS, or close contact within 10 days of the onset of symptoms with a person known or suspected to have SARS infection. Laboratory criteria include the following: (1) the detection of an antibody to SARS-CoV in specimens obtained during acute illness or 21 days after illness onset; (2) the detection SARS-CoV RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that was confirmed by a second PCR assay by using a second aliquot of the specimen and a different set of PCR primers; or (3) the isolation of SARS-CoV. A case of probable SARS is defined as having met the clinical criteria for severe respiratory illness of unknown etiology with onset since February 1, 2003, and epidemiologic criteria, irrespective of the laboratory result. A case of suspect SARS is defined as having met the clinical criteria for moderate respiratory illness of unknown etiology with onset since February 1, 2003, and epidemiologic criteria, irrespective of the laboratory result.20\n",

SARS patients who have recovered from the acute illness should be monitored carefully for the possibility of continued viral shedding16 and the potential development of pulmonary fibrosis or late postviral complications. The prevention of spread is most important for this highly infectious disease. Isolation facilities, strict precautions against droplet exposure (ie, hand hygiene, and the wearing of gowns, gloves, N95 masks, and eye protection) among health-care workers managing SARS patients,22 the avoidance of the use of nebulizers on a general medical ward,1 contact tracing, and quarantine isolation for close contacts are all important measures.",
