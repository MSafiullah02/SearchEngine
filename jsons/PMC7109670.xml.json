The initial evaluation of the samples included routine viral, bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures; shell-vial cultures for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); direct fluorescent antibody staining for herpesviruses, respiratory viruses, and Legionella species; and cytologic testing with use of methods discussed elsewhere [21, 22]. In brief, BAL samples were inoculated into human foreskin fibroblast (HFF), A-549, and rhesus monkey kidney (RMK) cell cultures and maintained for 10 (A-549 and RMK) or 28 days (HFF), all at 35\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C. Shell-vial centrifugation cultures were performed using CMV- and RSV-specific antibodies, according to standard techniques described elsewhere [21]. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures used standard methodology in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at FHCRC [22]. Direct fluorescent antibody staining was performed for CMV, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, influenza viruses A and B, RSV, and Legionella species with use of pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies (Bartels) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of BAL sample was kept frozen at -70\u00b0C and subsequently tested under blinded conditions at the University of Virginia for HRV and human coronavirus, using RT-PCR by techniques described elsewhere [23, 24]. Human coronavirus RT-PCR was only done on the first 46 samples. The detection of amplification products was done by microplate hybridization according to published methods, with minor modifications [25]. Patient characteristics and treatment records were obtained from the electronic database and from patient charts maintained at FHCRC.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses have been increasingly recognized to be associated with severe respiratory complications in immunosuppressed HSCT recipients [27]. The present study provides additional evidence that HRV can be associated with life-threatening lower respiratory tract disease in such patients. HRV RNA was detected in 8% of patients who had a bronchoscopy with BAL for an acute pulmonary infiltrate. Half of the HRV-positive patients died during the first month after infection, and, ultimately, 5 of 6 died. However, all of the patients with HRV had coinfection with at least 1 other pathogen that is likewise associated with increased mortality in this population. It is unclear from the available information which agent, the HRV or the copathogen, was the primary cause of death in these patients. It is also not clear from these data whether rhinovirus by itself can cause lower respiratory tract disease. It is of interest that 2 of 6 patients identified appeared to show persistent HRV infection. These patients may have had more-compromised immunity that predisposed them to polymicrobial infections and a higher risk of infectious mortality. The frequency of coinfections suggests that HRV may predispose patients to additional infections, possibly through an immunomodulatory mechanism, as has been demonstrated with RSV and parainfluenza virus [21, 28] and indicated in vitro for HRV [29]. More data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

In contrast, Ghosh et al. [19] reported that all their patients presented with infection within the first 10 days after transplantation, which is indicative of nosocomial acquisition. Strict infection-control practices\u2014including the screening of symptomatic patients, instituting early isolation and cohorting, the universal use of gloves and masks for all contact with symptomatic patients, strict implementation of hand washing, and restricting staff and visitors with upper respiratory symptoms and children aged <12 years from visiting patients\u2014have been in place for the past 10 years at FHCRC and may have contributed to reduced risk of nosocomial HRV infections, particularly early after transplantation. In addition, our study took place after the institution of a policy that prohibited staff with uncontrolled respiratory secretions from having patient contact, which could have further limited the spread of HRV and coronavirus. It is also possible that earlier symptoms, restricted to the URT, may have been missed. Most studies, however, have suggested a rapid progression to lower airway involvement, if it occurs. As a result, it is unlikely that these patients were infected for a long period prior to their BALs. Future studies should do prospective viral cultures of the upper airways to get a better sense of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in this population.",

As a result, the study focused on patients with severe disease and does not provide data on the overall incidence of HRV infections in HSCT recipients. The selection of patients with pneumonia probably overestimates the risk of mortality secondary to HRV infection and gives no indication of the frequency of progression from upper airway disease to lower airway disease.

In addition, studies are needed to better clarify the epidemiology of HRV infection in HSCT recipients and to better understand the risk factors for progression of HRV URT infections into the lower respiratory tract. A prospective surveillance study in which all HSCT recipients with upper or lower respiratory symptoms have URT and, as possible, lower respiratory tract samples collected to assess the presence of HRV and human coronavirus by PCR would be needed to delineate the true epidemiology of these respiratory viral diseases in this population.
