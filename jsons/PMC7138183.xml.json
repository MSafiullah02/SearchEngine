The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China and then pandemic outbreak is 2019-nCoV or COVID-19. Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus which has a close similarity of the sequences of COVID19 to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) and the virus uses ACE2 as the entry receptor-like SARS-CoV.2 These similarities of the SARS-CoV-2 to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs) the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses termed the virus as SARS-CoV-2.3 The understanding of the genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important for the production of drugs and vaccines. So, in this review article, we provide the newest genetic and phenotype features of COVID-19 to investigate the role of these two factors in the pathogenesis and comparing it with its families.",

However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections.20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease.17\n,\n21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence.22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions.3\n",

Given the high rate of transmission of this virus between humans and its pandemics, it is important to identify the basis of its replication, structure, and pathogenicity for discovering a way to the special treatment or the prevention. Due to the high similarity of the virus to its families, efforts have been made to provide medicines and vaccines for COVID-19. Differences in the length of the spike as it is longer in COVID-19 are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of this virus.
