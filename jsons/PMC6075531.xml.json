Studies in the adults were open label; all of the subjects received the vaccine. The studies in children were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled; the subjects were assigned randomly 2:1 to receive vaccine or placebo, administered as nose drops (0.25 mL per nostril). The dose of vaccine was 106.0 plaque-forming units (PFU) for adults and HMPV-seropositive children, and 105.0 and 106.0 PFU doses were evaluated sequentially in HMPV-seronegative children.",

            "text": "An effective HMPV vaccine could prevent a substantial number of respiratory tract illnesses in young children. To our knowledge, rHMPV-Pa remains the only HMPV vaccine that has been evaluated in clinical trials. Although rHMPV-Pa was immunogenic and protective against HMPV challenge in NHPs [12], this experimental vaccine was overattenuated (i.e., insufficiently infectious and immunogenic in HMPV-seronegative children). Thus, although preclinical studies can identify appropriate vaccine candidates, careful stepwise assessment in clinical trials is essential. The results of this study also highlight the need for placebo-controlled trials and assessment for adventitious viral infections in young children, because respiratory illnesses occur frequently in this population [15]. Future efforts to develop a live attenuated HMPV vaccine are warranted. Our data on rHMPV-Pa provide preclinical benchmarks that will help identify other vaccine candidates that are less attenuated. These candidates might include, for example, rHMPV-Na, which bears the AMPV N gene rather than the AMPV P gene and was shown to be less attenuated than rHMPV-Pa in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of NHPs [12]; HMPV with deletion of the SH or G gene, which was shown to be less attenuated in the upper (\u2206SH and \u2206G) and lower (\u2206SH) respiratory tracts of NHPs than rHMPV-Pa [16]; and HMPV bearing point mutations designed from comparable mutations in RSV, which have not yet been evaluated in NHPs.",
