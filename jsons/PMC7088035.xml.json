Among the protozoa, free-living amoebae (FLA) exist in high numbers in aquatic environments where they play a useful role as predators of micro-organisms, contributing to nutrient recycling by assimilating nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphate and releasing them into the environment by excretion (Taylor 1982; Rodriguez-Zaragoza 1994; Siddiqui and Khan 2012). Although mostly non-pathogenic, some FLA such as Acanthamoeba, Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris and Sappinia pedata have been implicated in opportunistic and non-opportunistic eye, skin and central nervous system human infections (Visvesvara et al. 2007; Visvesvara 2013; Fuerst et al. 2015).",

            "text": "In addition to causing infections, FLA can also interact with and act as reservoirs and transmitters of waterborne pathogens. Organisms mostly associated with HAIs such as Legionella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter spp., Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp. and Aspergillus spp. have been reported to coexist with FLA in the hospital environment (Thomas et al. 2006; Cateau et al. 2014; Lagan\u00e0 et al. 2014). These organisms can infect and survive the exposure to oxygen radicals, the acidic environment and the lysosomal enzymes in the phagosomes of FLA. In addition to survival, some bacteria can multiply inside FLA (Greub and Raoul 2004; Lone et al. 2009; Siddiqui and Khan 2012). Organisms in this category are collectively known as \u201cendocytobionts\u201d (Scheid 2014). FLA may upregulate virulent genes of endocytobionts resulting in increased infectivity for human macrophages in vitro (Schmitz-Esser et al. 2008; Siddiqui and Khan 2012). Furthermore, the interaction of amoebae with pathogenic endocytobionts can decrease the susceptibility of these pathogens to biocides mainly used to treat water in water systems (Miltner and Bermudez 2000; Coulon et al. 2010). Regular monitoring of FLA and associated endocytobionts in hospital and other health care institutions is thus essential to manage and prevent possible exposure to patients, staff and members of the public who visit these institutions. In South Africa, contamination of hospital water supplies with waterborne pathogens has largely been overlooked. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the co-occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and their associated bacteria in two selected public hospital water networks in South Africa.",

Samples were collected from the municipal water inlets, theatres, intensive care units (ICU), endoscopy units, renal units, neonatal ward, neonatal ICU milk rooms, diarrhea ward and sterilization units of the two hospitals. Biofilm samples were collected by swabbing inside the taps prior to opening them. Water samples were collected after running the taps for 1\u20132 min in 1-L sterile sampling bottles containing 5 mg/L sodium thiosulfate (Merck, SA) to neutralize the chlorine disinfectant and oxidizing biocides which may be present at the time of sampling. At each sampling site, water temperature and pH were measured with a portable COMBO TESTER\u00ae (Hanna, SA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Residual chlorine was measured using a chlorine photometer (Hanna, SA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Each filter membrane was placed upside down onto a non-nutrient agar (NNA) plate overlaid with a suspension of heat-killed Escherichia coli (E. coli) ATCC 25922 (E. coli; 100 \u03bcL for each plate). The plates were incubated aerobically at 32 \u00b0C and examined daily for 3 weeks under a light microscope (Olympus, Japan) with \u00d710 objective for appearance of amoebal trophozoites and/or cysts. Plates were recorded as negative if no amoebae were observed after 3 weeks. Plates containing amoebae were sub-cultured by cutting small agar plugs, placing them upside down onto fresh NNA-E. coli plates and incubating as before. Sub-culturing was done three times to purify amoebae cells. Once purified, amoebae cells were harvested by gently scraping the agar surface and re-suspending in 1 mL PAS. To further remove extracellular bacteria and debris, the suspension was centrifuged three times at 1000\u00d7g for 20 min. The washed pellet was re-suspended in 1 mL PAS. The suspension was inoculated into 24-well microtitre plate wells (Nunc, USA) and incubated at 32 \u00b0C.

Hundred microliters of the lysed amoebae suspension was then inoculated onto blood agar (NHLS, SA) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Representative colonies were inoculated onto fresh blood agar plates and incubated as above. Gram stains were performed on the colonies to group them as Gram positive or negative. Pure colonies were placed in a tube containing 3 mL saline (BioM\u00e9rieux, Inc.), and the density was monitored with the VITEK\u00ae2 DensiCHEK\u2122. Bacterial suspensions not within the appropriate zone were adjusted to 0.5\u20130.63 McFarland standard. Once the correct density was achieved, the appropriate VITEK\u00ae2 Identification Card was selected and inserted into the tube containing the suspension. Thus, the VITEK\u00ae2 Identification Card for Gram-positive organisms was placed in the tube containing the Gram-positive bacterial suspension, and the VITEK\u00ae2 Identification Card for Gram-negative organisms was placed in the tube containing Gram negative bacterial suspension. Thereafter, the instructions on data entry and how to load the cassette into the instrument were followed as directed by the manual and instrument.

These standards, however, do not cover water used in haemodialysis units to treat renal patients. The Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) used by the South African Renal Society (SARS) recommends residual chlorine of \u2264 0.50 mg/L for renal water, which is within the limits of the reverse osmosis (RO) water collected. The AAMI standards do not state the ideal pH range for renal dialysis water. Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes generally have a wide pH tolerance (2\u201311); however, an optimum range of 5.5\u20138.5 is recommended for maximum performance. The lower pH of 3.8 observed at hospital B might have been caused by acid feeds used to control membrane fouling during reverse osmosis. The resulting acidic water may leach copper from the distribution system or the dialysate which may cause side effects such as nausea, chills, headaches or even liver damage to the patient (Corbett et al. 2014).",

However, there has been a lack of information regarding the occurrence of FLA from South African hospitals. The prevalence of FLA in 43.3 % (77/178) of the samples in the current study is similar with a study in Egypt by Hassan et al. (2012) which isolated amoebae in 42.9 % (30/70). Other studies in the USA and India have identified amoebae in 14.8 % (13/88) and in 14.0 % (14/100) of hospital samples, respectively (Ovrutsky et al. 2013; Khurana et al. 2015). Studies from Germany and France reported amoebae prevalence of 51.8 % (29/56) and 68.9 % (73/106) respectively (Rohr et al. 1998; Lasheras et al. 2006). The variability in the prevalence of FLA in water distribution systems can be explained by differences in geographical areas and sample source of the previous studies with the current study (Corsaro et al. 2009). In addition, there is no consensus on sampling and processing methods for isolation of amoebae from environmental samples to date, which further affects prevalence rates among studies.",

Two separate studies by the same research group in hospital environments also reported the presence of Acanthamoeba species in 47 of the 135 (34 %) samples collected (Carlesso et al. 2007) and 31 of the 135 (23 %) samples (Carlesso et al. 2010). Studies in Tunisia and Egypt have also shown a high detection rate of 32.6\u201342.9 % of Acanthamoeba species in haemodialysis and dental waters (Dendana et al. 2008; Trabelsi et al. 2012; Hassan et al. 2012). Generally, Acanthamoeba has been the most frequently isolated genera in tap water as they are easily identified morphologically compared to other FLA (Thomas et al. 2006; Co\u015fkun et al. 2013). The low prevalence of the genus Acanthamoeba in our study relative to Vermamoeba can be attributed to the use of FLA common primers which might have been more effective in amplification of Vermamoeba rather that Acanthamoeba (Muchesa et al. 2015).",

However, in our study, phylogenetic analysis identified Acanthamoeba isolates in hospital A (neonatal ward, neonatal ICU and paediatric diarrhoea ward) and hospital B (trauma ICU, endoscopy unit and theatre) that closely resembled the T3 genotype. This was relationship was supported by a bootstrap value of 18 %. The low support values may be because of more sequences to the data set analyzed, that is, the better your data, the lower the support values (Wheeler and Pickett 2008). This means our bootstrap value may still be closer to a realistic one than other with higher figures, but few sequences. The other isolate from neurosurgical ICU of hospital B closely resembled the T20 genotype. The T3 genotype which includes A. griffin, A. pearcei and A. hatchetti has been associated with Acanthamoeba keratitis (Gonzalez-Robles et al. 2001; Visvesvara 2013). A recent study in Iran also isolated the T3 genotype in tap water and swab samples of a high dependency unit that caters for haemato-oncology patients, showing its association with hospital water systems (Khurana et al. 2015). The T20 genotype, previously miss-assigned to genotypes T16 or T4, consists of strains responsible for keratitis, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and respiratory infections in humans (Visvesvara 2013; Fuerst et al. 2015).",

These individuals might be exposed to these opportunistic FLA through ingestion, inhalation or aspiration of aerosols or contact (Anaissie et al. 2002; Trabelsi et al. 2012). In addition, the residual chlorine range of 0.01\u20130.35 mg/L in water samples analyzed in this study is not sufficient to eliminate FLA as they have been shown to survive exposure to concentrations as high as 100 mg/L for 10 min (Storey et al. 2004).

Rowbotham (1980) conducted the first study to prove the association between bacteria that is Legionella and the FLA, Acanthamoeba. Numerous other studies have also shown that amoebae in man-made water systems such as drinking water, tap water, swimming pools and cooling towers can be infected by many other relevant bacteria which could use amoebae as a platform for multiplication (Greub and Raoul 2004; Molmeret et al. 2005; Thomas et al. 2006; Pagnier et al. 2008). This study is the first in South Africa where any association between free-living amoebae and bacteria has been reported in hospital water systems. In this study, the most prevalent bacterial species detected in hospital A were Serratia marcescens and S. maltophilia; hospital B: S. marcescens, S maltophilia, D. acidovorans, S. paucimobilis and C. testosteroni. All the above detected bacteria have been reported as part of the complex microbial ecology in hospital water systems. They have been implicated in hospital acquired infections in healthcare settings, with patients being exposed through drinking, skin contact and inhalation of aerosols (Thomas et al. 2006; Thomas and Ashbolt 2011; Cateau et al. 2014). These bacteria are associated with systematic blood, respiratory tract, the urinary tract, ocular and soft tissues infections (\u00d6zdemir et al. 2011; Orsini et al. 2014; Perez et al. 2014; Bilgin et al. 2015).",

Our study has similarities with a study by Lagan\u00e0 et al. (2014), on the occurrence of FLA and Gram-negative bacteria in an Italian hospital water system, where Vermamoeba spp. coexisted with S. paucimobili, P. fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter lwoffi, S. maltophilia and C. testosteroni. The endocytobiontic relationship in all bacteria detected in this study and amoebae has been described by several studies and reviews where bacteria have been demonstrated to survive or proliferate before being released into the environment by amoebae lysis or in amoebae vesicles (Pagnier et al. 2008; Saisongkorh et al. 2010; Thomas et al. 2010; Maschio et al. 2015). Host-endozytobiont relationships in FLA allow FLA (mainly in cyst form) to form a physical barrier using the resistant cellulose cell walls, offering endozytobionts (bacteria) protection against adverse conditions such as extremes of temperature, UV light ozone, chlorine dioxide, monochloramine and copper-silver (Greub and Raoul 2004; Thomas et al. 2004; Bagheri et al. 2010). This can allow bacterial regrowth in the water system when environmental conditions are favourable (Coulon et al. 2010; Dupuy et al. 2014). In addition, low disinfectant concentrations in distribution networks have limited activity on FLA and also allow the formation of biofilms which enhances amoebae and bacteria persistence (Barbeau and Buhler 2001; Thomas et al. 2004). Studies have also shown that passage through amoebae is likely to increase the virulence and antibiotic resistance of bacteria substantially, enabling them to prepare for subsequent survival in macrophages (Miltner and Bermudez 2000; Schmitz-Esser et al. 2008). Furthermore, upregulation of virulent genes and horizontal transfer of genes can occur between the intracellular bacteria and their amoebae resulting in bacteria which are more resistant to human macrophages (Siddiqui and Khan 2012; Gomez-Valero and Buchrieser 2013).",

Using microscopy, PCR and 18S rDNA sequencing, Acanthamoeba spp. (T3 and T20 genotypes), V. vermiformis and Naegleria gruberi were identified. From the amoebae positive samples, S. marcescens, S. maltophilia, D. acidovorans, S. paucimobilis and C. testosteroni were the most commonly detected bacterial species. Therefore, the co-occurrence of these bacterial species with FLA in our study suggests that these interactions may be important for the transmission, survival and multiplication of bacteria in water systems where immunocompromised patients are constantly exposed, posing an important public health concern.",
