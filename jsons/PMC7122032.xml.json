Once local and international responders identified the virus, they took a year to interrupt its widespread transmission. By April 2016, Ebola had accounted for more than 28,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths. People around the world watched with increasing alarm, as this tragic course of events played out, and with concern that air travel could enable the virus to spread across continents. This epidemic highlighted not only the inadequacy of local health systems to recognise and respond but also that international organisations were not ready to provide timely expertise and resources to control the situation and ameliorate the virus\u2019s spread through the region. Had health officials identified Ebola in West Africa promptly, they could have minimised its impact on the lives and livelihoods of the populations of West Africa by implementing appropriate control procedures.",

Authorities began surveillance to identify atypical pneumonia cases but this, and the containment response, were too late to stop SARS spreading. A Chinese urologist who was infected travelled to Hong Kong and spread SARS to another 16 persons. Within weeks, SARS spread to 25 countries with more than 8,000 reported cases (Fig. 10.1) [3]. By the end of the epidemic in July 2003, SARS had killed 774 people [4]. Although unable to contain the outbreak of SARS, the international community was able to bring the epidemic under control within six months\u2014by collaborating across countries to identify and isolate all probable cases. Nevertheless, the Asian Development Bank estimated that the economic loss due to SARS in affected countries was up to US $28 billion with US$ 5.8 billion on Mainland China (approximately 1.2 per cent of its annual gross domestic product (GDP)) and US$ 6.6 billion in Hong Kong (approximately 4 per cent of its annual GDP) [5].",

Each country has an additional list of diseases that it requires its health workers to report by law. Diseases of greatest public health threat are reportable, meaning that health workers or laboratory technicians must report individual cases as they occur. Reportable diseases include those required by IHR and, for example, anthrax, cholera, Ebola, legionellosis, plague and the ZIKV. Other conditions are notifiable, meaning that health workers should report the number of cases that have occurred in a given time period. The number, frequency of reporting and breakdown of reportable and notifiable diseases varies by country. Diarrheal cases, influenza cases, tuberculosis, AIDS and other significant endemic diseases are usually required to be notified to local health authorities.

When they examined the surveillance data closely, the epidemiological pattern of encephalitis cases was different to what they expected\u2014the disease occurred mostly among male adults of Chinese ethnic origin whose occupations related to pig farming.

In 1998, after the first studies suggesting cigarette consumption was related to lung cancer, and the US Surgeon General issued a warning, the annual per capita consumption decreased to 2,261 [16].
