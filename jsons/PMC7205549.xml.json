This record provides clues as to how we can address this invisible enemy.",

In Italy, the total number of cases reached 100 on February 24, and subsequently reached 1,000 on March 1, therefore Italy\u2019s SS1000 was 6 days.

Second, the government announced a strict policy on February 17, 2020, that requires people to visit a doctor only if they have 4 days of continuous fever (>37.5\u00b0C). This criterion constitutes a major barrier that prevents people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 from accessing testing. Therefore, whether intentional or not, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan may have been greatly underestimated compared with that of other countries.",

Also, the number of COVID-19 deaths may have been underestimated. If we hypothetically assume that there have been 500 COVID-19\u2013related deaths in Japan to date (ie, >10 times the confirmed number of deaths), the increase may not have been noticed because these deaths are hidden among the 100,000 pneumonia-related deaths that occur every year in Japan.4",

According to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the total number of COVID-19 cases was 712 with 10 related deaths,5 for a CFR of 1.4%.

Limiting society functions, such as strict lockdown, is often accompanied by major adverse effects among the socially vulnerable, including elderly people or the patients suffering from the other diseases, and it may result in deaths from other causes.
