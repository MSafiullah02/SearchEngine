The researchers discovered that influenza A (H1N1) virus is a complex virus composed of 4 variant viruses, including 1 avian influenza virus, 1 common influenza virus and 2 swine influenza viruses that widely spread in pigs. Meanwhile, the researchers proved that rearrangement and recombination of influenza A (H1N1) virus genes commonly and extensively exist. Currently, the pathogenesis of influenza A (H1N1) virus has attracted focused attention by scholars both internationally and within China. It has been demonstrated that apoptosis of host cells induced by influenza A (H1N1) virus contributes to its pathogenesis. Many studies have proved that influenza A (H1N1) virus induces apoptosis that is mediated via Caspase approach, which can be regulated by multiple channels, multiple factors and multiple genes. It has been also proved that influenza A (H1N1) virus induces apoptosis with a complex process.",

Three days later, the patient experienced fever again with no known cause with a body temperature of 39.0 \u00b0C as well as aversion to cold, chest distress, dizziness, headache, systemic weakness, muscle soreness and other upsets. But the patient experienced no runny nose, no nasal obstruction, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no palpitation, no hemoptysis, and no difficulty breathing. However, she had sore throat with sensation of foreign substance when swallowing and nausea. By physical examination, body temperature 37.3 \u00b0C, pulse 108/min, respiration 22/min, and blood pressure 102/63 mmHg. Lips showed no cyanosis; pharynx with obvious congestion, slight follicular hyperplasis at the posterior pharyngeal wall but no white spots, and both tonsils with II degree swelling. The both lungs showed coarse breathing sound as well as fine dry and moist rales. She reported a history of contact to a patient with similar fever and a history of contact to a patient with definitively diagnosed type A H1N1 influenza. In addition, her school was affected by type A H1N1 influenza. By CDC throat swab, the M gene of type A influenza virus was positive, the NP gene of swine H1N1 influenza virus positive, and the HA gene of type A H1N1 influenza virus positive. By routine blood test, WBC 15.31 \u00d7 109/L, GR% 82 %, PLT 144.0 \u00d7 1012/L, and HGB 140.9 g/L.",

The patient experienced respiratory failure and was given several times of CPR, which resulted in ribs fracture and subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall. The key point for differential diagnosis from lobar pneumonia is that the lesion of consolidation in the cases of lobar pneumonia is located within one lung lobe or one lung segment.

Therefore, their differential diagnosis can be made in combination to clinical manifestations and the absorption stage of lobar pneumonia.",

The lesions often progress into diffuse ground glass opacity or consolidation in both lungs within 1\u20133 days. And the condition is commonly complicated by pneomothorax and mediastinal emphysema. In this case, the lesions in both lungs alternatively aggravated and alleviated, with changes by reexaminations each day. Therefore, the patients with pneumonia induced by type A H1N1 influenza virus should receive chest plain X-ray or CT scan each day during the following-ups for immediate understandings about the progression of the lesions and appropriate treatment.",
