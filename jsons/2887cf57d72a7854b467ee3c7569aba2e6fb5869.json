            "text": "In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS- was firstly discovered in Wuhan, China. Since then, Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has risen to a global healthcare emergency, starting in late February 2020 in Northern Italy and rapidly becoming pandemic. The spectrum of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from mild to critical. While the former accounts for 80% of cases, severe disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and critical disease with respiratory failure and/or multiple organ dysfunction are diagnosed in 15-30% and 5% of COVID-19 patients, respectively (1). In the first month of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy, intensive care unit (ICU) admission represented 12% of all COVID-19 patients and 16% of those hospitalized (2) . Overall, COVID-19 estimated case fatality rate ranges from 2.3% in China to 7.2% in Italy (3). However, in China's virus pandemic epicentre during the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, the in-hospital overall lethality rate was higher (28%), and rose up to 62-97% in severely-ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. (4) . As of March 25 2020, in Lombardy, Italy, 1591 patients were admitted in ICUs, of them, 405 (26%) had died in ICU, 256 (16%) had been discharged from the ICU, while 920 patients (58%) were still in the ICU The IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) is a cornerstone treatment for hyperinflammatory conditions such as Still's disease, and has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of cytokine storm syndromes, including macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine release syndrome (9).",

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab and chest computerized tomography scan showed bilateral ground glass opacities. The patient was put on non-invasive ventilation and antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine was started. At day 3, his conditions worsened requiring ICU admission at our Hospital for invasive mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic support. On ICU admission, the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was 160 on pressure control ventilation, with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 12 and FiO2 50%. High levels of acute phase reactants and progressive liver cholestatic injury were observed (Table 1) . Hepatic involvement with liver enzymes higher more than five-folds their upper limits contraindicated treatment with remdesivir or tocilizumab. At day 10, considering the patient's critical conditions (PaO2/FiO2 85, volume control ventilation PEEP 14 FiO2 50%) and the hyperferritinemic inflammatory status with ferritin levels more than 3000 ng/ml, use of off-label anakinra was considered and started with the following dosage schedule: 200mg intravenously followed by 100 mg every 6 hours subcutaneously. Lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine were interrupted and no other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drug, including glucocorticoids or immunoglobulins, was started. In the next 72 hours, a sharp reduction of inflammatory markers and ferritin, an increase in lymphocyte count and a significant reduction of liver enzymes were ob- (Table 1 ). Respiratory parameters improved by day 13 (PaO2/FiO2 270, pressure control ventilation PEEP 10 FiO2 30%), followed by a favourable radiographic evolution. At day 18 the patient was discharged from the ICU.",

A cytokine profile resembling sHLH, characterized by increased levels of IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, INF-\u03b3, CXCL10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, and TNF\u03b1 was described in severe COVID-19 (13) . Predictors of mortality from a retrospective, multicentre study of 190 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1435\u00b73 mcg/L in non-survivors vs 503\u00b72 mcg/L in survivors) and IL-6 levels (5), suggesting that higher mortality rates may be associated with a virally driven hyperinflammation.",

Previous reports demonstrated that a cytokine storm occurs in SARS-CoV-1 and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV infection, with high levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, interferon (INF)-\uf067 and INF-\uf067 induced chemokine CXCL10(7).
