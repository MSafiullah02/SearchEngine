With fewer patients presenting to hospitals with the diagnosis of STEMI, healthcare workers are wondering what is causing this decline. This piece presents data from two medical centers and addresses several possible causes to explain this phenomenon. It was found that there was a statistically significant decrease from January to March 2020 in number of presenting STEMI diagnoses.",

Since that time, SARS-CoV-2 (commonly referred to as \"Coronavirus\" or COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As a precautionary measure, many hospital systems have cancelled all elective procedures while states are encouraging stay-athome measures for patients and their families. Such measures have resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of patients presenting to the hospital for non-COVID related complaints. Anecdotally, it seemed that the incidence of ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) has decreased significantly since the start of this pandemic, raising the question of why this change may be occurring. Through this piece, we postulate several reasons to explain this change and provide local data to support a decline in incidence in recent months.",

Europe and Asia have been combatting the COVID-19 epidemic for far longer than the United States. The relatively recent introduction of Coronavirus to the United States not only means that hospitals have had less time to \"feel the effects\" of COVID-19, but has also provided the opportunity for American physicians to learn and prepare from international data.",

Additionally, there was a 14.6% drop in cases between January 2020 and March 2020, marking the first time in two years in which March had fewer recorded cases than January. Further, our data demonstrates that the population mean number of STEMI cases in March is 40.5 cases/month (99.9% CI [37.0, 44.0]). This year's March case number falls below the lower bound limit of the CI at 35 cases.",

For many patients with risk factors for STEMI, they may dismiss their chest pain as benign relative to the risk of contracting coronavirus at a hospital. An increase in the incidence of late presenting MIs with CHF and sudden cardiac death would lend validity to this claim. Furthermore, the overwhelming effect of COVID-19 on the healthcare system may be causing healthcare workers to fail in recognizing and diagnosing MIs, artificially decreasing the incidence during this time.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the closure of many businesses and non-essential services in an effort to mitigate the spread of disease. Restaurants in particular have been affected, resulting in significant impacts on the American diet. Therefore, the decreased incidence of MIs may in part be attributable to decreased access to fast food and unhealthy salt-rich and fatty foods. According to data collected in 2015-16, the CDC found that 39.8% of adults aged 20 and over were classified as obese [4] . With restaurant closures and fear of leaving the home, Americans may in fact be improving their cardiac health by controlling fluid and salt intake, decreasing their consumption of fried foods, and eating more grains, fruits, and vegetables.",

Our incidence may be less prominent than the data from Spain and Hong Kong for several key reasons. First the United States had ample time to prepare and learn from international responses. Further, as previously mentioned, North Carolina has not been particularly affected by this pandemic. As of April 1st, 2020, the state as a whole had a cumulative total of 1,700 cases [5] . Our findings may be more pronounced in states more significantly affected by COVID-19. Further studies could evaluate how Cardiac Catheterization Lab volumes rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, examining the time of symptom onset to hospital presentation of STEMI prior to, during, and following the COVID-19 pandemic can be of significance to support these claims. At this time, we are only able to speculate regarding the clear and obvious decline of presenting and treated MIs. References:",
