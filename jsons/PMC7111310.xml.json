Thelazia callipaeda is a whitish nematode infesting the conjunctival pouches and the lachrymal ducts of dogs, cats, rabbits, wild carnivores and humans (Anderson, 2000). In the case of T. californiensis, the pathogenesis stills unknown (Bowman et al., 2002). Onchocerca lupi in dogs causes ocular lesions of various degrees, but in cats the specific pathology is not properly described (Labelle et al., 2011). Cuterebra larval migration is proposed to be a potential cause of feline ischemic encephalopathy and feline seizure disorders (Glass et al., 1998; Williams et al., 1998).",

The other four species are G. paralysans, O. rostratus, Troglostrongylus brevior and Troglostrongylus subcrenatus, which are sporadically reported (Bowman et al., 2002; Brianti et al., 2013). Prior studies of metastrongylid species infecting cats have demonstrated the presence of A. abstrusus, O. rostratus and Troglostrongylus sp. in Spain (Jefferies et al., 2010).",

Gurltia paralysans, first reported in the 1930s (Moroni et al., 2012), is considered a neglected feline neurological parasitosis (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2017). It is a neurotropic metastrongylid nematode of domestic cats that is mainly found in the veins of the spinal cord subarachnoid space and parenchyma (Bowman et al., 2002). The parasite causes neurological pathologies, usually invades the leptomeningeal vasculature, causing diffuse meningomyelitis and thrombophlebitis (Bowman et al., 2002; Gomez et al., 2010; Mieres et al., 2013). Moroni et al. (2012) cited G. paralysans as a rare parasite, and provided new information on associated clinical and pathological findings in naturally infected domestic cats from southern Chile, where three cases of neurological diseases were reported. However, no previous data are available on the presence of G. paralysans as ectopic parasite. The presence of ectopic parasites is often related to immunosuppression, but in this case, normal values were obtained in all the analyses carried out, showing that it was apparently an immunocompetent cat.",
