Consequently, to assess the likelihood of infection, risk factors for COVID-19 disease should be taken into consideration. Even if diagnostic criteria are still debated, WHO clinical criteria for pursuing COVID-19 diagnostic evaluation are commonly used. According to WHO 32 , COVID-19 should be considered in patients with fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea) who have had any of the following in the prior 14 days: 1. Close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately two meters of a patient for a prolonged time or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).",
