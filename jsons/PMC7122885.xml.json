Accordingly, laboratory administrators are required to have an operational laboratory that can provide not only accurate and reliable results but also an environment that is safe for the laboratory worker. Although low risk, any specimen has the potential to contain a pathogen that could cause a laboratory-acquired infection; thus whether supporting a small critical access hospital or a large acute care facility, the laboratory needs to be prepared to handle specimens with a potential to contain or known to contain a high-risk pathogen. These emerging high-risk pathogens (also defined as high-consequence pathogen [HCP] or risk group 4 [RG-4] pathogen) have the ability to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventative or therapeutic interventions are not readily available.",

In a recent survey of infectious diseases physicians, a question was asked as to where they think specimens with the potential to contain a RG-4 pathogen were tested. The results showed that <50% of these physicians surveyed had a clear understanding where this testing was performed. They suggested that laboratory testing was most likely performed off-site (38%) without describing where this might be or they were unsure where this testing was done (22%) [2]. In a follow-up to this survey, a compilation of comments from these physicians showed that the clinical laboratory generated the second highest level of comments after personal protective equipment (PPE), suggesting that many unknowns still existed on how the laboratory supported the care of patients infected with a HCP [3]. Another study also showed significant discrepancies in guidance documents for clinical laboratories from both professional and government sources which exacerbate the difficulty and confusion inherent in dealing with an emerging infectious disease [4].",

To do this, a biological risk assessment is first performed to determine the potential for exposure from sprays, splashes, or aerosols generated during laboratory activities. Although a qualitative assessment is a subjective process that involves professional judgment, the assessment is performed based on the potential of what can happen with assumptions made in the process [7]. The first part of the assessment is to identify the hazards (i.e., activities) that can cause exposure, prioritize the risks, and mitigate the identified risks using engineering controls, administrative controls (work practices), and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Although the utilization of appropriate PPE with training in proper donning and doffing is a critical step for worker safety, the use of a certified biological safety cabinet for primary containment when handling or manipulating patient specimens is also recommended for the laboratory [5, 7, 17]. In addition, laboratory equipment that is used to process specimens should have closed tube processing (i.e., sealed rotor or safety cups for centrifugation), and if open tube processing occurs, the equipment should be manipulated within a biosafety cabinet. The ultimate goal for safety is to protect the laboratorians and environment from contamination while ensuring that an optimal level of care is provided to the patient [18].",

All facilities should have protocols developed and procedures drilled and exercised on an annual basis to safely collect specimens to evaluate a PUI for a HCP. For instance, guidelines are available to help facilities create appropriate processes to safely collect blood samples as needed [20]. Each step in the collection process should be evaluated by experts in infection control in an effort to limit exposure. This process requires multiple glove changes during the collection, multiple disinfection steps, and triple packaging of specimens within the patient isolation area. In addition, all facilities should have a plan in place to manage other potentially serious medical issues that may develop while the PUI is in isolation and awaiting results of confirmation testing. Specific tests might include a complete blood cell count, electrolyte analysis, or specific direct tests for other infectious diseases caused by such pathogens as the influenza viruses, group A Streptococcus, and malaria protozoans. For those laboratories that support facilities where these patients might be sent for treatment, a list of essential tests have been described with additional supplemental tests that might be considered (Table 6.4) [7, 21]. Each medical facility needs to define which tests will be available following consultation among the appropriate medical staff and the laboratory administration.",

Numerous POC instruments have been developed that could provide this support (Table 6.5). It is important however to ensure that these instruments are used as approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For instance, some POC devices that are used to test samples from critically ill patients may be considered off-label use (i.e., glucose meters), requiring that the laboratory establish performance specific for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, reportable range of test results, reference intervals, and other performance characteristics as required. It is also important to ensure that a quality management program for each instrument be developed to meet all applicable federal and state regulations as well as the standards of the laboratory\u2019s accrediting agency and the device manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The regulatory standards may differ substantially depending on whether a CLIA-waived or non-waived assay is chosen. Frequency of external quality control testing can range from a per reagent lot verification to every 8 h dependent upon the FDA test complexity level, the manufacturers\u2019 recommendations, and any applicable accreditation standards. In some cases, external quality control frequency may be reduced by performing a thorough risk assessment of the device and assay and developing an individualized quality control plan (IQCP). Facilities will also need to determine where POC testing is performed (at the bedside, in-unit laboratory, or in-hospital laboratory) and who will perform the testing. Individuals who will be operating the instruments must meet the competency standards as required for each assay. Another advantage of these instruments is the small size and the ability to perform testing within a biosafety cabinet as primary containment for safety. With the proper use of a biosafety cabinet, the potential for exposure to aerosolized highly infectious materials from these POC instruments can be reduced.",

In addition to an essential list of laboratory tests that will be available to provide care for the HCP patient, the laboratory also needs to define what equipment/supplies are necessary to provide these required tests.

These are added costs that are necessary to preserve a quality management program that will meet the regulatory requirements of a certified laboratory.

Laboratorians also acknowledge that technology is constantly changing and that adaptation to these changes is necessary. The balance of safety and providing quality results for patient care continues to be a delicate balance for the laboratory. Two future areas that may impact the laboratory overall, but are clearly needed for the high containment labs, include access to specimen collection devices that have the capacity to inactivate pathogens but still allow for the specimen to be acceptable for testing and the development of automated instruments by manufacturers that provide work flow efficiencies that includes close system testing along with specimen tracking. The development of specimen collection devices containing chemicals that can render a pathogen inactive while still stabilizing the specimen for testing has only recently been commercially developed for HIV testing [31, 32]. Additional work needs to be done in this area to expand the commercial availability of these types of collection devices for other applications. Making specimens noninfectious will also enhance the ability to transport and provide the means for in-house, long-term storage of these specimens to evaluate experimental drug applications and for potential future research activities without the regulations of the select agent program. With the development of safer equipment by manufacturers, the ability to test specimens with minimal handling will also reduce exposure opportunities in the laboratory. These and other ongoing changes will help hospitals enhance safety while providing optimal care for patients with infections caused by HCPs.",
