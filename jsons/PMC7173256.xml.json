Routine sputum cultures have identified the causative agent in only about 20% of cases and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage frequently has failed to establish a diagnosis. Open lung biopsy is often a risky procedure, owing to the possibility of hemorrhage secondary to the patient's thrombocytopenia, and frequently shows only nonspecific acute and chronic inflammation. Many clinicians have recognized that the high failure rate has been due in part to the fact that some of these pneumonias were not caused by bacteria. In retrospect, it is somewhat surprising that those of us caring for immunocompromised patients did not give much consideration to community respiratory viruses as a possible cause of some of these infections.",

Community respiratory virus infections also develop in renal transplant recipients, but they are often less serious and may resolve without therapy. Age plays a role in susceptibility to some of these infections. For example, adenovirus infection is reported to be twice as common in children receiving bone marrow transplants as in adults.[11]Some infections, such as those caused by influenza virus and RSV, are seasonal; others, such as those caused by parainfluenza, are not.
