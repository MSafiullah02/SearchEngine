It can be difficult to determine whether the subdued nature of the animal is related to an underlying illness or the circadian cycle. This is especially the case with hamsters. When possible, receptionists should schedule appointments for most rodents for the early evening hours. Appointment times are not as critical for gerbils and degus.

Keep in mind, in performing abdominal palpation, that some rodents such as degus and prairie dogs have intra-abdominal testes. Examine the anogenital region for discharges and staining of the fur or skin. When a rodent is picked up, it generally urinates and defecates. Have a dipstick ready to perform an immediate urinalysis or a syringe handy to aspirate urine off a clean surface for urinalysis; feces can be caught in a small tube and examined later if required. By this point in the examination, the condition of the fur and the body in general have been assessed. Palpate the limbs for tenderness or fractures and pay special attention to the paws, noting the length of the nails and the state of the footpads. Rodents are fastidious groomers and therefore can groom away evidence of underlying disease/illness easily. Observe the medial aspect of the front legs for crusts, debris, alopecia, or porphyrin staining, which may occur from excessive grooming associated with nasal discharge. Also, keep in mind that some cage mates are aggressive groomers and can remove any evidence of illness by keeping their mates well groomed.",

Although this may seem rather obvious, much of the literature describing the maladies of pet rodents has been inferred indiscriminately from conditions seen in laboratory rodents. The diagnosis and treatment of pet rodents involves evaluation and care of an individual animal from a household, not the health management of rodents from a research colony. Derangements likely to be seen in practice include trauma-induced injuries, infectious and parasitic diseases, neoplasia, and problems related to nutrition and aging; genetic disorders are uncommon. Dermatologic conditions make up 25% of the cases in exotic pets presented for small-animal consultations in general practice in the United Kingdom.42 Natural infections that would be considered rare in a laboratory animal colony often are transmitted to pet rodents by other household animals and children; for example, cats and dogs are major reservoirs of dermatophytes,24 and humans are the natural host of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, which are now often antibiotic-resistant.2 Rodents used for research are maintained in tightly controlled environments designed to reduce the impact of unwanted variables in animal experiments.14 However, pet rodents are generally exposed to temperature, humidity, and light-cycle changes; a broad range of foods; numerous microorganisms borne by animals and humans; and various types of handling. Rodents obtained from pet stores have had to endure the stress of overcrowding, transport, and on occasion temperature extremes, all of which put them at risk for disease. As a result, pet rodents exhibit a wider range of physiologic and pathologic responses than do rodents used for research. Consequently, the disease presentation of many pet rodents is atypical as compared with the classic experimental disease description.",

Other sound husbandry practices include housing different species separately to prevent interspecies disease transmission (e.g., rats carry Streptobacillus moniliformis, a cause of septicemia in mice, in their nasopharyngeal cavities) and reducing obesity by limiting food intake and providing cage accessories (e.g., exercise wheels, tunnels, and ramps) that allow play and exploration.

Behavioral, husbandry, and infectious causes of skin disease are relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat. However, many skin diseases characterized by chronic or ulcerated skin (often secondarily colonized by bacteria) are diagnosed as idiopathic. This group is commonly unresponsive to topical or systemic treatment, and affected individuals are often euthanatized. Most damage to the skin is done by toenails as the rodent scratches itself. It is difficult to prevent a rodent from scratching. The nails can be trimmed or filed to remove sharp ends, but attempts to fit the rodent with a bandage or protective wrap are often pointless, as these animals are adept at removing all bandages. Restraint collars can be used, but rodents are not able to eat easily with a collar in place and it will not be effective unless the underlying cause is detected and treated simultaneously.",

Social dominance, a form of behavior relating to the social rank and dominance status of an individual mouse in a group, is manifested as barbering and fighting. Barbering is commonly a condition seen in group-housed mice, where the dominant mouse nibbles off the whiskers and hair around the muzzles and eyes of cage mates. No other lesions are present, and only one mouse (the dominant one) retains all of its fur. Removal of the dominant mouse stops barbering; frequently, however, another mouse then assumes the dominant role. Barbering occurs during acts of mutual grooming in which one member of a mouse pair grasps individual whiskers or hairs with its incisors and plucks them out. Although plucking appears painful, recipients are passive in accepting barbering and even pursue conspecifics for further grooming.85 Barbering may also be seen associated with sexual overgrooming as a form of stress-evoked behavior, and lactating mice may display \u201cmaternal\u201d barbering, produced in the process of suckling pups, in which alopecia is seen from tail to chin.47 Although rare in mice, consider infection with Trichophyton mentagrophytes in cases of alopecia that involve face, head, neck, or tail in all or just a few mice.22 Barbering has a genetic-based behavioral background, as aggressive inbred strains of mice do not use barbering in their behavior.47 In pet mice, barbering is often seen in female mice caged together. Male mice except littermates raised together from birth are more likely to fight, often very savagely, and inflict severe bite wounds on one another, especially over the rump, tail, and shoulders.",

The cause is an underlying vasculitis attributed to immune complex deposition on dermal vessels.48 Dietary factors and dysregulated fatty acid metabolism have been implicated in the development of the disease and the severity appears to be modulated by dietary fat and vitamin E content. Gavaging affected mice with 0.1 mL per day of liquid from an essential fatty acid supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids was associated with regressed lesions and resolved pruritus in a small sample of affected mice.60 We have obtained good treatment results using a generic omega-3 fatty acid supplement at 0.1 to 0.2 mL PO q24h. The ulcers may heal with fibrosis and resulting skin contracture or progress to a Staphylococcus xylosus secondary bacterial infection.48., 100.\n",

It spends a relatively short time on a host and penetrates the skin for feeding only. Severe infestations can cause anemia, debilitation, and death in rodents. When an animal host is not available, humans can become the victims of mite infestation. Locating the resident host of the mite is critical in its successful elimination.

Cervical lymph nodes also become enlarged. There is no treatment for this disease. Glandular healing follows within 7 to 10 days and clinical signs subside within 30 days, with few residual lesions remaining. During acute inflammation, affected rats are at high risk for anesthesia-related mortality because of the decreased diameter of the upper respiratory tract lumen; also, ocular lesions such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcers, synechiae, and hyphema can develop secondary to lacrimal dysfunction.

The major component of CRD is M. pulmonis, and the disease is also known as murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM). Rats may live 2 to 3 years with CRD. While M. pulmonis is rarely seen in laboratory rats, serologic test results of pet rats are usually positive. A survey of 28 pet ratteries in the United States found that all were positive for M. pulmonis.17 Clinical signs are highly variable: in many cases no signs are present even though significant pulmonary lesions may exist. The prevalence and severity of signs typically increase with the age of the rat and the presence of environmental stresses placed upon the animal. Initial infection commonly occurs without any clinical signs; early signs involve both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts and may include snuffling, nasal discharge, polypnea, weight loss, hunched posture, ruffled coat, head tilt, and red tears.110 The most important aspect of CRD for clinicians is that respiratory mycoplasmosis varies greatly in disease expression because of environmental, host, and organismal factors that influence the host-pathogen relationship. Examples of such factors include intracage ammonia levels, concurrent Sendai virus, coronavirus (sialodacryoadenitis virus), PVM, rat respiratory virus and/or CAR bacillus infection, the genetic susceptibility of the host, the virulence of the Mycoplasma strain, and vitamin A or E deficiency.110 Auscultation is insensitive in determining the severity of respiratory disease, and radiographs are often unremarkable. However, CT scan often reveals significant pulmonary disease. Serology is the preferred choice for diagnostic testing, as Mycoplasma is difficult to grow in a laboratory. Younger rats naturally exposed to M. pulmonis may be seronegative for up to 4 months postexposure.21\n",

Bronchodilators are the primary treatment for SACB. Inhaled nonselective muscarinic antagonists (e.g., ipratropium bromide) and beta-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g., albuterol, salmeterol) as well as oral theophylline provide significant although modest efficacy. Frequent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary, as microbe colonization is a common finding. Tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline are efficacious in CRD. Treating with doxycycline (5-10 mg/kg PO q12h) or a long-acting depot such as doxycycline (Vibravenos, Pfizer Animal Health, www.Pfizer.com), 70-100 mg/kg SC or IM q7d) often helps affected rats.",

Corynebacterium kutscheri pneumonia is rare in pet rats. Pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae can be of sudden onset. Young rats are more severely affected than are older ones, and often the only sign they exhibit is sudden death. Mature rats may demonstrate dyspnea, snuffling, and abdominal breathing. A purulent exudate may be seen around the nares and on the front paws (from wiping of the nostrils). A tentative diagnosis is based on the identification of numerous gram-positive diplococci on a Gram stain of the exudate or in a sample submitted for cytologic examination. Severe bacteremia is an important consequence of advanced disease and results in multiorgan abscesses and infarction. Treatment must be aggressive, and the use of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins such as cloxacillin, oxacillin, and dicloxacillin (all of which can be administered orally) is recommended.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration can be estimated with the use of a blood dipstick, and proteinuria can be detected on urine dipstick analysis. Chronic progressive nephrosis (CPN) is the best known age-related disease in rats. In CPN, the kidneys are enlarged and pale and have a pitted, mottled surface that often contains pinpoint cysts. Lesions consist of a progressive glomerulosclerosis and myriad tubulointerstitial disease primarily involving the convoluted proximal tubule.36 The most striking change in renal function is proteinuria exceeding 10 mg/day that increases in severity progressively with age. The features of CPN are qualitatively similar among different strains of laboratory rats, but the onset, incidence, and severity of the disease vary considerably. The disease occurs earlier and is of greater severity in males than in females: urinary protein excretion averaging 137 mg/day has been documented in 18-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas excretion averaging 76 mg/day was reported in female rats of the same age.91 Dietary factors appear to have an important role in the progression of CPN. Caloric restriction, the feeding of low-protein diets (4%-7%), and limiting the source of dietary protein reduce the incidence and severity of CPN. Feeding soybean protein (as opposed to casein) and caloric restriction contribute substantially to reducing the incidence and severity of CPN; low-calorie diets that contain high protein levels do not decrease the incidence or severity. Drugs and exposure to chemicals can also exacerbate CPN. Treatment is supportive and involves feeding a low-protein diet and administering anabolic steroids.",

It is caused by the intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis, which is also responsible for proliferative enteropathy in pigs and ferrets.59 Treatment must be aggressive and involves correcting life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, administering antibiotics, and force-feeding. Several antibiotic treatments are recommended, including tetracycline-hydrochloride (400 mg/L of drinking water for 10 days), tetracycline (10 mg/kg PO q12h for 5-7 days), enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO or IM q12h for 5-7 days), and trimethoprim-sulfa combination (30 mg/kg PO q12h for 5-7 days). Symptomatic treatment with bismuth subsalicylate may be given if diarrhea persists. Replacement electrolyte and glucose solutions should be given orally, and electrolyte fluid replacement such as saline or LRS should be given at a dose 20 mL/100 g q24h. Diagnosis often depends on necropsy and histologic examination, although fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed.75 Sequelae to proliferative ileitis in surviving hamsters may include eventual obstruction, intussusception, or rectal prolapse (Fig. 27-8\n) (see Chapter 28).15\n",

Hamsters with clinical signs resembling those of Cushing\u2019s disease are occasionally seen in practice. Diagnosis is based on identifying classic signs similar to those seen in dogs, such as a history of polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia; clinical signs of alopecia and hyperpigmentation; and high concentrations of plasma cortisol and serum alkaline phosphatase. Normal hamster cortisol concentrations are low compared with those of other species and range from 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/dL in normal males and females.108 Research has suggested that hamsters may secrete both cortisol and corticosterone.72 Therefore meaningful measurement of plasma cortisol concentrations in hamsters is empiric at present. If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected, the cause\u2014such as hypersecretion by a functional tumor, primary adrenal hyperplasia, or excess adrenocorticotropic hormone production\u2014is often more difficult to determine. Hamsters respond to exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation.108 The treatment of hamsters described in the clinical reports indicated that ketoconazole (5 mg/kg q12h for 1 month) did not work, o,p\u2019-DDD, now known as mitotane (5 mg PO q24h for 1 month) did not work, and metyrapone (8 mg PO q24h for 1 month) worked in one of two hamsters.

Hamsters with sialodacryoadenitis may develop keratoconjunctivitis sicca and exophthalmos and subsequent proptosis. Occasionally, a hamster\u2019s eye is displaced forward if the caregiver restrains the animal too tightly by holding the skin at the back of the neck. If the hamster is treated soon after the exophthalmos occurs, the prognosis for saving the eye is good. Cleanse the ocular area gently with an ophthalmic wash and lubricate the eye with sterile ophthalmic lubricant. Gently retract the lid margins around the globe until the eye returns to its normal position. Treat the eye with an antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for a minimum of 7 to 10 days. Occasionally, tarsorrhaphy will be needed to prevent recurrence. Enucleation may be necessary if the eye cannot be replaced or if significant trauma to the proptosed eye has occurred.",

In older hamsters, lymphoma is the most frequently observed neoplasm of the hematopoietic system.99 These tumors are often multicentric, involving the thymus, thoracic lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, superficial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other sites. Cytology of the tumors is variable. A second variation, cutaneous lymphoma, is seen in adult hamsters and resembles mycosis fungoides, an epidermotropic T-cell lymphoma in humans.40 Clinicians have described lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, patchy alopecia, and exfoliative erythroderma in affected animals. Pathologists have observed dense infiltrates of neoplastic lymphocytes in the dermis with extension into the epidermis. The third variation is an epizootic lymphoma in young hamsters caused by hamster polyomavirus (HaPV).4 When HaPV is first introduced into a naive population of breeding hamsters, it can result in epizootics of lymphoma, with an incidence as high as 80% among animals. Once enzootic in a hamster population, the occurrence of lymphoma declines to a much lower level. Enzootically infected hamsters develop HaPV skin tumors rather than lymphoma. Hamsters with HaPV lymphoma appear thin, often with palpable masses in their abdomens. Tumors associated with HaPV often arise in the mesentery but can also arise in the axillary and cervical lymph nodes. The tumors are often lymphoid, but erythroblastic, reticulosarcomatous, and myeloid types occur.",

Clinical lesions adjacent to the external nares appear erythematous initially; these lesions progress to localized alopecia and then to an extensive moist dermatitis (Fig. 27-12\n). The cause is believed to be an increase in the secretion of porphyrins by the Harderian gland (as in chromodacryorrhea in rats), which acts as a primary skin irritant.20 Various staphylococcal species (S. aureus and S. xylosus) may act synergistically to produce the dermatitis.95 Stress may cause excessive harderian gland secretion. Two examples of stress are overcrowding and exposure to an environmental humidity of greater than 50%, which causes the fur coat to stand out and appear matted. Gerbils require sand baths to keep their coats from becoming oily. Keeping the gerbil in a dry environment, cleaning its face, and providing soft clay or sand bedding instead of abrasive wood chip bedding will usually alleviate the problem. Use topical or parenteral antibiotics (except streptomycin) in gerbils with severe dermatitis.",

Ball-ended dosing needles are ideal for gavage, but always carefully calculate the volume of the dose and depth of penetration when using the dosing needle to prevent gastric rupture.
