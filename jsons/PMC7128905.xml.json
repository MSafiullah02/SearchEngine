Usually, samples are collected from the disease lesions, using swabs, fluids, and tissue samples. Various secretions/excretions can be collected, depending on the mode of virus shedding. Viruses in which a viremic phase occurs following exposure may be isolated from blood; however, this most often is possible only in the early stages of infection. Collection of virus for virus isolation optimally is done in the acute phase. Later in infection or during chronic infection, the presence of host antibody may inhibit virus growth in the laboratory. The speed of shipment that is required depends on the lability of the virus; nonenveloped viruses tend to be hardier and less susceptible to inactivation than enveloped viruses [4]. Because the identity of the virus usually is not known, overnight shipment on cold pack is ideal. Certain information should be provided to the laboratory to facilitate the chances of successful propagation (eg, species, history, clinical presentation). Cell lines that are used vary with the suspected virus; any information that can assist the diagnostician in the appropriate selection of propagation medium is helpful.",

Specific identification usually is done through the use of virus-specific antibody in an assay, such as immunofluorescence. Alternatively, a virus activity may be exploited to identify the virus. For example, the virus of Newcastle disease, avian paramyxovirus\u20131, agglutinates chicken red blood cells (RBCs).

Obviously, the virus must remain viable during shipment which can be a problem with certain labile viruses (eg, herpesviruses). Rapid shipment in refrigeration is required which may add to the cost. The presence of other components (eg, bacteria, toxins) can interfere with the ability of the virus to grow in the laboratory. For example, hepatic viruses can be difficult to isolate because of the presence of cell culture toxins in the liver tissue [2]. This also is true if neutralizing antibodies are present. Additionally, some viruses simply do not grow well in an in vitro system. This is true for some enteric viruses, for example.",

Therefore, this service may not be widely available; it is primarily found at academic and research institutions. Also, expertise is required to identify the virus which also may impact availability. The fee for this service varies with the laboratory, but usually is reasonable, despite the expensive equipment. A drawback to electron microscopy is its relative lack of sensitivity. Generally speaking, approximately 106 particles per gram of sample are required for visualization [1], [4], [5]. More may be required for small viruses, such as parvovirus. Because of this, electron microscopy usually is restricted to testing of feces in cases of enteritis where virus concentration is significant in the acute phase of disease. For example, in diarrhea that is caused by parvovirus, the animal may be shedding more than 109 particles per gram. It also is used to identify viruses in cell culture, where the virus has been amplified through growth in the laboratory. It is too insensitive to detect virus in most tissue, fluid, or swab samples. These require propagation before detection. One exception to this may be poxviruses. Because of their large size, they may be seen in samples from lesions.",

These include tissue impression smears or scrapings, cells pelleted from fluids, and cell cultures. Generally, slides are made by the practitioner and submitted to the laboratory. Neither fixation nor special storage is required before submission. The quality of the sample does affect the results. Because the assay involves detection of infected cells, the more cells that are on the slide, the more likely it is that infected cells will be identified. Most IFA assays use fluorochrome-labeled antibody, such as fluorescein (\nFig. 3; direct) [1], [3]. Therefore, it is important that before collection of ocular samples, fluorescein staining of the eye must be avoided. Also, purulent discharge will result in background fluorescence because of the autofluorescence of granules in white blood cells and should be removed before collection of the sample. Bacteria also may lead to background fluorescence.",

Some available assays include feline leukemia virus, canine parvovirus, rotavirus, equine influenza virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Most use pathogen-specific antibody for capture and detection as for IFA assays (Fig. 4B). The antibody is anchored in a solid substrate, such as a membrane or plastic well. The sample, usually in fluid form, is added. The initial sample collected may be fluid (eg, serum for feline leukemia virus) or the sample may be solubilized in a diluent using a swab (eg, feces for parvovirus). If the virus is present, it will be bound by the anchored antibody. This is followed by soluble pathogen-specific antibody with enzyme attached, which will bind the bound virus. Addition of the substrate for the enzyme leads to a color change. Washing is a critical step in many ELISA assays to ensure unbound antibody is removed. Variations on this protocol may be found with different assays, but the underlying technique of pathogen-specific antibody binding the virus in the sample is similar in all (\nFig. 4) [1], [3], [4].",

Therefore, the RBCs will pellet in the well. The highest dilution at which agglutination of the RBCs is inhibited is reported as the titer (\nFig. 9). This assay measures antibody to epitopes on the surface protein of the virus. These proteins are under immunologic pressure for variability; thus, virus strains may vary in the antigenicity of these proteins [29]. Antibodies to highly conserved proteins (eg, polymerase or core proteins) are not detected by this assay. As a result, antibody that recognizes these specific epitopes on one virus strain may not recognize a different strain in this antigenic region. For example, HI is used often to measure antibodies in reptiles to OPV. We found that by using different isolates of ophidian paramyxovirus (OPV) in the assay, different antibody titers will result with the same serum because of variability of the epitopes among virus strains (unpublished data).",
