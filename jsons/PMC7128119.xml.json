            "text": "Cathepsins are a family of lysosomal proteases that can be classified into three groups based on the amino acid residues in their active sites: (i) cysteine protease, which include cathepsins B, C, F, H, K, L, O, S, T, U, V, W, and X; (ii) serine protease, which include cathepsins A and G; (iii) aspartic protease, which include cathepsins D and E [1]. Human cathepsin D is composed of 412 amino acid residues that contain a 20-residue prepeptide and a 44-residue propeptide [2]. Cathepsin D is synthesized in rough endoplasmic reticulum as a preproenzyme, which is converted to the 52 kDa procathepsin D after removal of the prepeptide. Procathepsin D is glycosylated at two N-linked glycosylation sites and modified with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) at two asparagine residues [3]. The modified procathepsin D is targeted to lysosome by binding to M6P-receptors in trans-Golgi network that directs lysosomal segregation [4]. In the lysosomal compartment, the 44-residue propeptide was cleaved, resulting in a 48 kDa single chain intermediate active enzyme [5]. Like other aspartic proteases, cathepsin D has in the catalytic site two aspartate residues that are essential to enzyme activity. The physiological function of cathepsin D is to cleave intracellular proteins, including hormones and growth factors, and activate proenzymes and cellular factors involved in various cellular processes such as innate immune response and apoptosis [6], [7], [8]. In mice, cathepsin D is an essential enzyme, and cathepsin D deficiency results in death in the fourth week after birth [9].",

The propeptide region not only acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme activity but also required for the proper folding of the newly synthesized enzyme and transport of the proenzyme to lysosomes [10]. In mammals, cathepsin L functions mainly to degrade proteins in the lysosome and is known to be involved in antigen processing and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [11]. Once secreted, cathepsin L can degrade extracellular matrix and thus participate in tumor growth and metastasis [12].",

Some fish cathepsins D and L, such as those of zebrafish and rainbow trout, are known to be involved in oogenesis and embryogenesis [23], [24]. However, except in a few cases, the potential immunological relevance of piscine cathepsins D and L remain unknown. In this study, we report the identification and expressional analysis of cathepsin D (CsCatD) and cathepsin L (CsCatL) from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), an important economic fish species cultured widely in China. We found that the expressions of both CsCatD and CsCatL were regulated at transcription level by bacterial and viral infection. In addition, we also observed strong inductions of CsCatD and CsCatL expression by vaccination with a subunit vaccine. Our results suggest an immunological role for CsCatD and CsCatL in pathogen infection and vaccination.",

Recent studies showed that mammalian cathepsin L is involved in the infection of some viruses. For example, in one case, cathepsin L inhibitors blocked the entry of human coronavirus 229E, and in another case, cathepsin L is required for proteolytically processing of the Ebola virus glycoprotein during infection [36], [37], [38], [39]. In our study, following challenge with the megalocytivirus RBIV-C1, CsCatD and CsCatL expressions in kidney and spleen were significantly (P < 0.05) upregulated, with peak inductions occurring at 12 h post-challenge in kidney and at 24 h post-challenge in spleen (Fig. 5\n).
