            "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine the physical collection efficiency of commercially available filters for collecting airborne bacteria, viruses, and other particles in the 10-900 nm (nanometer) size range. Laboratory experiments with various polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC) and gelatin filters in conjunction with Button TM Inhalable samplers and three-piece cassettes were undertaken. Both biological and non-biological test aerosols were used: Bacillus atrophaeus, MS2, polystyrene latex (PSL), and sodium chloride (NaCl). The B.atrophaeus endospores had an aerodynamic diameter of 900 nm, whereas MS2 virion particles ranged from 10 to 80 nm. Monodisperse 350 nm PSL particles were used as this size was believed to have the lowest filtration efficiency. NaCl solution (1% weight by volume) was used to create a polydisperse aerosol in the 10-600 nm range. The physical collection efficiency was determined by measuring particle concentrations size-selectively upstream and downstream of the filters. The PTFE and gelatin filters showed excellent collection efficiency (>93%) for all of the test particles. The PC filters showed lower collection efficiency for small particles especially <100 nm. Among the tested filters, the lowest collection efficiencies, 49 and 22%, were observed for 1 and 3-mm pore size PC filters at the particle sizes of 47 and 63 nm, respectively. The results indicate that the effect of filter material is more significant for the size range of single virions than for bacteria. The effect of filter loading was examined by exposing filters to mixtures of PSL particles, which aimed at mimicking typical indoor dust levels and size distributions. A 4-h loading did not cause significant change in the physical collection efficiency of the tested filters.",

            "text": "Concern over airborne dissemination of viral particles such as the coronavirus, influenza virus and bioterrorism agents as well as the growing use of engineered nanoparticles have increased the need for additional environmental sampling techniques, especially for the nano-scale particle size range. Nanoscale particles have sizes <100 nm (Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005) . Viruses range in size from 20 to 200 nm and can be found in droplet nuclei or attached to other airborne particles . Viruses in the Orthomyxoviridae family include those associated with influenza such as the Avian flu virus and range in size from 80 to 120 nm (Mandell et al., 2005) . It is estimated that globally $5% of all adults and 20% of all children develop symptomatic influenza infections each year (Nicholson et al., 2003) . It is a costly disease that results in much human suffering as well as economic impact in terms of lost time and medical expenses. Viruses in the Coronaviridae family, which includes the virus linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), range in size from 80 to 150 nm (Mandell et al., 2005) . There is also much interest in developing environmental sampling techniques for bioterrorism agents including bacterial agents such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague) and Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and viral agents including variola major (smallpox) and filoviruses and arenaviruses (viral hemorrhagic fevers), some of which are found in the smaller particle ranges (CDC, 2006) .",

One limiting factor for traditional bioaerosol sampling has been the use of culturable count as a measure of exposure. The development of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) techniques, which do not depend on culturability, allows for the detection of microorganisms of interest with a short analysis time. This has led to the possibility of conducting longer term air sampling and the evaluation of individual exposures using personal breathing zone filter sampling instead of estimates based on short-term area monitoring.",

            "text": "Some bioaerosol collection techniques have been studied in great detail. Koller and Rotter looked at several issues concerning the use of gelatin filters for collecting airborne bacteria (Koller and Rotter, 1974) . They found that the gelatin filters had a collection efficiency of greater than 99.95% for particles between 0.5 and 3.0 mm in size. Jaschhof used the gelatin filter to collect laboratory-generated T1 phage and influenza A virus particles (Jaschhof, 1992) . He found a retention rate of 99.76% for the T1 aerosol and was able to culture influenza A virus collected during air monitoring in the room of a patient with Influenza Type A. Myatt et al. (2003) used 2.0-mm pore size polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters with cassette samplers to collect airborne rhinovirus. Utilizing a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), they were able to detect virus on the filter with a sampling time of 40 h. Booth et al. (2005) examined several different monitoring techniques to determine if SARS coronavirus could be detected in environmental samples collected in Toronto hospitals. Using a slit sampler and a PCR technique, the investigators obtained two positive air samples from a room with a recovering SARS patient. Wet swab sampling yielded positive results for commonly touched surfaces, including a bed-side table, remote control, and medication refrigerator door. At the same time, traditional air sampling with PTFE filters did not yield any results above the detection limit. It should be noted that no information was provided about extraction techniques while extraction has been shown to affect the filter sample data in a major way (Booth et al., 2005 , Burton et al., 2005 . Tseng and Li (2005a) investigated the collection efficiency in terms of viability for four different bacteriophages with four different samplers. They found that gelatin filter samplers, Andersen impactor samplers, and impingers were more suitable for the collection of viral particles than the sampler equipped with nucleopore (membrane) filters. Alternative sampling methodologies have also been developed, e.g. a new personal bioaerosol sampler that allows collecting bioaerosol particles through porous media immersed in a collection fluid (Agranovski et al., 2004 a,b) . The collection fluid can then be used in various analyses.",

The Button Sampler was chosen for this study since it can be used in a stationary as well as personal mode and its sampling efficiency closely follows the ACGIH/ISO inhalability curve at 4 l.p.m. (Aizenberg et al., 2000) . The 0.3-mm pore size PTFE filters preloaded in 37-mm cassettes were also used with the SKC Universal sampling pumps but at a lower flow rate of 2 l.p.m. because that is the manufacturer's recommended flow rate. A radioactive neutralizer was used when filters were loaded into the Button Sampler to neutralize electrostatic charges. The volumetric flow rate for each sampler was pre-and post-calibrated after each laboratory run using a mini-Buck calibrator (A.P. Buck, Inc., Orlando, FL, USA). The filters were placed inside the chamber as shown in Fig. 1 .",

One-tenth of a milliliter of re-constituted PSL particles were mixed with 50 ml of sterilized, deionized water to create stock solutions In order to determine a typical concentration and particle size distribution in indoor air to use for the loading experiment, aerosol measurements were carried out for 23 h with the OPC in a home that was part of a larger indoor air quality study (Lee et al., 2006a) . Then, three separate PSL test mixtures were created using aliquots of 0.35, 0.54, 0.69, 0.61, 1.08, 2.43 and 5.05-mm stock solutions. The comparison of the particle size distributions of the field-measured indoor aerosol and the laboratorygenerated PSL mixtures (with fractions from 0.35 to 5.05 mm) is presented in Fig. 2 as a numeric percentage. This figure shows that the field-measured levels can be reproduced in the laboratory using a mixture of monodisperse PSL particles of different sizes.

For the 0.35-mm PSL particles, the particles that were detected in the channel >0.3 and <0.4 mm were used for the calculations. When testing with smaller particles, including MS2 virus and NaCl, we used a Wide-range Particle Spectrometer (WPS\u00d4; Model 1000XP, configuration A, MSP Corporation, Shoreview, MN, USA). With three devices built in [the condensation particle counter (CPC), differential mobility analyzer (DMA), and light particle spectrometer (LPS)], this instrument size-selectively measures particles starting from 10 nm.

They range from 0.3 kPa for the 0.3-mm pore size PTFE filters to 15.2 kPa for 0.4-mm pore size PC filters. Due to the high-pressure drop observed for 0.4-mm pore size PC at the 4 l.p.m. flow rate, this filter was not used in further testing. The 0.5-mm pore size PTFE filters also showed a high-pressure drop at 4 l.p.m., which occasionally caused pump failure during sampling. When the collection filters are used with the button sampler, the overall pressure drop can be reduced by replacing the manufacturer-provided metal filter support with an autoclavable metal mesh support as described by Lee and associates (Lee et al., 2006b) . Figure 3 presents the collection efficiencies obtained for the three test aerosols. For the airborne B.atrophaeus, the tests filters showed an average E pce of 94% or higher. The 1-mm PTFE filter showed a statistically significantly lower E pce (average 94%) when compared to the other filters. This information, however, could not be verified by additional experiments since this filter is no longer manufactured and additional filters could not be obtained. The collection of 0.35-mm PSL particles on the 3-mm pore size PC filters (average 69%) was significantly less efficient than that obtained with the other filters. For the MS2 virions, the 1-and 3-mm pore size PC filters had E pces = 68 and 27%, respectively. These were statistically significantly lower than the collection efficiencies obtained for the PTFE and gelatin filters, which were >96%. Furthermore, the collection efficiency of the 3-mm PC filter was the lowest among the tested filters. The high collection efficiency for the gelatin filters for the MS2 virions agrees with the results of prior investigations (Koller and Rotter, 1974; Jaschhof, 1992) . Figure 4 presents the particle size selective data on the collection efficiency of the 1-and 3-mm pore size PC filters and 0.3-and 3-mm pore size PTFE filters challenged with NaCl particles. The minimum E pces for the 1-and 3-mm pore size PC were observed at the particle average diameter of 47 and 63 mm, respectively. The respective E pces values were 49 and 22%. In contrast, the 0.3-and 3-mm pore size PTFE filters showed minimum E pces of 99.7 and 98.4%, respectively. The data obtained with the NaCl particles is in agreement with those obtained with PSL particles of 0.35 mm and MS2 virions measured within a size range of 10-80 nm, (see Fig. 1 ). The low E pce for the PC filters also agrees with the reported performance of PC filters since the 1980s. Hinds and Liu and associates reported that minimum filter efficiencies for membrane filters were at $50 nm, which agrees with the data shown in Fig. 3 (Hinds 1999; Liu, 1983) . In our tests, we observed that when loading and unloading the PC filters in the Button Samplers it was important to ensure that the filters were not wrinkled. Smith et al. (1993) noted difficulty with PC filters in terms of static charges and problems with folding and wrinkling during filter loading. It should be noted that previous studies have found that gelatin filters dried out over time and were of limited use for long-term sampling (Burton et al., 2005, Tseng and Li, 2005a) .",

Figure 5 presents the physical collection efficiency of three filters before (E pce ) and after (E pce-loaded ) particle loading as measured with 0.35-mm PSL particles and MS2 virions. The collection efficiencies obtained for the pre-and postloading for both particle types are very similar to those presented in Fig. 3 . Similar to E pce , the E pce-loaded was higher for the 0.35-mm PSL particles (>90%) than for the MS2 particles (>67%) when tested with 1-mm pore size PC filters. The 0.3-mm pore size PTFE filters exhibited high E pces-loaded (>99%) with both challenge aerosols. The 3-mm pore size PTFE filters showed E pce-loaded of >99%",

The 0.3-mm PTFE filter used with the 37-mm threepiece cassette exhibited the lowest pressure drop and highest physical collection efficiency for B.atrophaeus and MS2 particles. The other PTFE filters also showed very good physical collection efficiencies across the size range of 10-900 nm with relatively low pressure drop. PTFE filters were found to have good recovery of aerosolized bacteria when used in button samplers (Burton et al., 2005) . Additional work, however, needs to be conducted to investigate the recovery efficiency for smaller particles from the PTFE filters. The tested gelatin filter also had good physical collection efficiency, but may not be suitable for long-term sampling due to potential drying out (Burton et al., 2005, Tseng and Li, 2005a) . The PC filters made of a thin layer of material appear to have little internal capture capability when compared to the fibrous membrane filters in the nanoscale particle size range. At the same time, the PC filters exhibited acceptable E pce with the B.atrophaeus bacteria (the largest aerosol particles tested in this study). The findings suggest that the PTFE filters are the best option among the tested ones for long-term personal sampling of nano-scale particles and virions in terms of collection efficiency. Several of the tested filters were found to be equally appropriate for the collection of bacteria including the 1-mm PC, 0.3-mm PTFE and 3-mm PTFE filters.",
