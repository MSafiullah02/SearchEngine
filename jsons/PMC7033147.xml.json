Every year worldwide, there are an estimated one billion cases of influenza, of which approximately three to five million are severe cases, resulting in 290,000 to 650,000 influenza-related deaths1. The recommended antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prevention of influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs)2. After oseltamivir and zanamivir were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999, peramivir and laninamivir were developed for the prevention and control of influenza3,4, peramivir and laninamivir were developed for the prevention and control of influenza5,6. The two NAIs oseltamivir and zanamivir were widely used during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic7. The most common adverse effects for oseltamivir are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea8. Zanamivir can cause bronchospasm when administered by inhalation4. The U.S. FDA has recently approved the intravenous use of peramivir5, but has not approved laninamivir for use.",

Oseltamivir was the NAI most commonly showing AEs in the FAERS data, and the most common AEs for this drug were psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders, similar to the findings of previous studies8,13\u201316. For zanamivir, the most common AEs were general disorders and administration site conditions, consistent with a previous report4. The signal detection PRR, ROR, and IC methods were able to detect several AEs associated with oseltamivir only in the FAERS data. The most likely cause is the extremely low number of AE cases for other NAIs. To support our results, sensitivity analyses were conducted using the disproportionality method stratified according to gender or type of reporter. Similar trends were observed in other sensitivity analysis that limited the data further via certain gender or health professional reporters. Additionally, AE signals for vomiting and hallucinations were detected in younger patients given oseltamivir, while an abnormal hepatic function, cardiac failure, shock and cardio-respiratory arrest were detected in older patients given peramivir. However, in the WebMD data, we could not detect signals by these disproportionality analyses due to the small number of AE cases, although psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders were the most common AEs reported. The numbers of the younger and older subjects were quite low compared to the number of adults in the WebMD data, possibly due to the low rate of accessibility to the internet or digital devices and/or the recognition of the need to report.",

            "text": "Oseltamivir phosphate is an oral prodrug which undergoes hydrolysis by hepatic esterases to convert an active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate24. Oseltamivir can induce neuropsychiatric adverse effects with either a sudden or delayed onset. Sudden-onset reactions are due to the direct effects of oseltamivir on the central nervous system, whereas delayed-onset reactions are due to the effects of oseltamivir carboxylate24\u201326. Oseltamivir phosphate itself can cause the central depressant actions that may result in abnormal behavior, delirium, hallucinations, sleep, and respiratory depression26. Oseltamivir phosphate can inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and monoamine oxidase A. Additionally, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate and their related receptors/channels are thought to be other candidates related to respiratory suppression24. It has been shown that while oseltamivir carboxylate cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) readily, it may do so when combined with other agents or when the BBB is immature or impaired12. Most oseltamivir-induced neuropsychiatric adverse effects have been reported in Asian populations14,15,26. Li et al. hypothesized that a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2233385, near the active site of human cytosolic sialidase which is a homolog of the virus neuraminidase and presents in Asian populations (9.29%), could increase the binding affinity of sialidase to oseltamivir carboxylate, thus reducing the sialidase activity and contributing to the occurrence of severe neuropsychiatric adverse effects27.",

Fortunately, a quantitative means of comparing the AE rates of one drug with those of all other drugs is now available. Nevertheless, the outcomes of comparisons of AE rates through a disproportionality analysis can be influenced by many factors, including absolute report numbers, the presence of other AEs associated with the same drug, significant heterogeneity, and potential bias issues such as physician preference for one drug over others and a patient\u2019s negative experience with a certain product along with reporting biases such as underreporting34. Additionally, other factors that can influence the association between the frequency of AE reporting and medicine include the length of time the medicine has been marketed and the extent of publicity about new safety concerns.

The MedDRA preferred term was used for a quantitative disproportionality analysis. Disproportionality was analyzed using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR)39, the reporting odds ratio (ROR)40, and the information component (IC) methods41. The PRR is calculated according to the ratio of the proportion of all reported cases of the event of interest among people exposed to a particular drug to the corresponding proportion among people exposed to all or several other drugs39. The ROR is calculated according to ratio of the odds of the reporting of one specific event versus all other events for a given drug relative to the matching reporting odds for all other drugs40. The IC measure can be considered as the calculation of the logarithm of the ratio of the observed rate of reporting of a specific drug-AE combination to the expected rate under the null hypothesis of no association between the drug and AE41. For the PRR, a given drug AE pair was defined as a signal if the event count was 3 or more, while the PRR was 2 or more with an associated chi-square value of 4 or more39. For the ROR, it was defined if the lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) of ROR exceeded 140. The information component (IC) algorithm performs signal detection via the IC025 metric, which is a lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval of IC, with an AE signal indicated when the IC025 value exceeds 041. For the WebMD data, the frequency of each theme of a patient medication concern was computed for each comment, with these outcomes then summed for all comments.
