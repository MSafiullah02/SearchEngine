Several strategies have been employed, including ensuring return of an immobilized individual to the group the same day, immobilizing several members of the colony at the same time (not just the animal requiring medical attention), and dusting animals to be reintroduced and others in the colony with talcum powder.",

No thyroid pathology was found at necropsy of feral raccoons captured in the same region of the captive animals. The feral animals were, however, considerably younger than the captive animals examined. One North American raccoon with thyroid carcinoma was obese and had a palpable cervical mass when examined.27 The animal's total thyroxin (TT4) concentrations were within domestic carnivore reference intervals; thus this neoplasm was considered nonfunctional and similar to the thyroid carcinomas seen in domestic dogs. Another captive North American raccoon was obese, and a cystic thyroid gland was discovered during an attempt at jugular venipuncture. This animal had an increased TT4 concentration, and an excisional thyroid biopsy revealed adenomatous hyperplasia. The thyroid disease in this animal closely resembled that seen in older domestic cats.
