Seroconversion to C. pneumoniae occurred in 1/11 paired sera, and another sample taken two weeks following the illness (from a patient with pneumonia and positive nasopharyngeal culture for Sp5 for whom an early sera testing was not available) yielded a high antibody titer for C. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae was isolated from 4 of the pneumonia cases (two blood cultures, two endotracheal cultures). All were Sp5. One additional, partially treated pneumonia case, had gram-positive diplococci in sputum gram staining, but the organism did not grow in culture.",

Pneumococcal outbreaks in non-elderly adults involve either a single [1], [3], [4], [12], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] or multiple [2], [20], [21], [22] pneumococcal serotypes. One large outbreak of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by Sp5 was recently reported from Canada, in a non-elderly urban population living in crowded and poor conditions [23]. In military outbreaks, serotypes 1, 4, 7F, 8, and 9V have been previously implicated [2], and in the most recently reported outbreak in the military a mixture of serotypes was identified (serotype serogroups 3, 6, 9, 14, 19, 20, 22, and 23) [20].

Third, Sp5 carriage rates are usually very low in healthy young individuals [3], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], yet, Sp5 was isolated from 24.1% of the cultured contacts during the outbreak. Furthermore, a near linear correlation between platoon-specific pneumonia incidence rates and Sp5 carriage rates was observed (Table 2).

However, a more interesting question is whether these two components were caused both by new acquisition of Sp5, or was the ILI component caused by a virus and the pneumonia component was caused by a secondary infection Sp5. Viral pathogens are a well established predisposing factor for pneumococcal pneumonia outbreaks and sporadic cases [19], [22], [33], but were absent in other reports [2], [12], [20]. Recent analysis of the 1914\u20131918 influenza pandemic also showed a similar pattern where in military outbreaks, pneumonia severe morbidity and mortality did not occur before 5\u20137 days after initiation of the vital outbreak [34]. Indeed, the fact that no pneumonia cases were observed during the first 5 days of the outbreak (Fig. 1) suggests a primary viral ILI.",

Still, one cannot rule out a role of other viruses that were not tested, such as rhinovirus or coronavirus; (2) S. pneumoniae type 5 is one of the most virulent S. pneumoniae serotypes, and thus may not necessarily require a preceding or concomitant viral infection, especially in the stressful military environment. New recruits are known to be highly susceptible to most S. pneumoniae serotypes, with only 15% of recruits having protective IgG antibody to common serotypes [2], [35]. In recruit bases, increased periodic introduction of naive subjects may interfere with herd immunity and increase carriage and morbidity. Physical and psychological stressors may further lead to immune depression in these populations, thus increasing the risk of infection [36], [37]; and (3) Both ILI and pneumococcal cases ceased abruptly and immediately after initiation of the mass antibiotic treatment. Thus, the ILI cases observed may represent mild or \u2018aborted\u2019 Sp5 cases that were resolved as a result of the early antibiotic treatment.",

            "text": "This large outbreak serves as a reminder of the potential extent and severity of pneumococcal outbreaks even if occurring among young, generally healthy adults. Early detection and treatment of new ILI cases may have prevented their progression to pneumonia, while mass antibiotic prophylaxis combined with universal pneumococcal immunization resulted in interruption of the outbreak. Previous outbreaks were halted either using mass antibiotic prophylaxis [1], mass pneumococcal vaccination [3], [4], [15], [38], a combination of these two measures [2], [12], [20], [39] or without any intervention [16]. As is evident from the epidemiological curve (Fig. 1), dispersal of recruits home did not alter the course of the outbreak, but neither was it associated with morbidity among household contacts. We believe that the role of antibiotics in such an outbreak is important, since the response to vaccine takes at least 7\u201310 days to be successfully mounted, while in such outbreaks an immediate response is needed. On the other hand, logistically, the most effective approach would use long-acting drugs, since they are the easiest to administer, need less frequent dosing and can improve compliance. We therefore chose to combine antibiotic mass treatment and vaccination to achieve both immediate protection and prolonged reduction of spread of the implicated S. pneumoniae serotype. We chose the long-acting azithromycin with a known prolonged nasopharyngeal effect on carriage that can last for \u226528 days [40]. The relatively abrupt halt in the outbreak was likely due to the use of azithromycin prophylaxis (single dose of 500 mg repeated after 1 week) coupled with vaccination of recruits. Immediately following day 1 of the intervention, no new pneumonia cases occurred and overall pneumococcal carriage was reduced to <1% (a decrease that was sustained for over 1 month), confirming the effectiveness of azithromycin prophylaxis, as previously documented in some outbreaks [2], [12], [20] but not in others [18], [35]. However, when using azithromycin for mass treatment, one must remember that this long-acting drug is clearly associated with increased risk of selection of antibiotic resistance among respiratory pathogens in general and azithromycin in particular [41].",
