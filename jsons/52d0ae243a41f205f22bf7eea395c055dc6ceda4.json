The aim of this paper was to consider how omics techniques can be used to improve and refine microbiological risk assessment, using dose-response models for RNA viruses, with particular reference to norovirus through the oral route as the case study. The dose-response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to the development of mechanistic dose-response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Applying omics to dose-response relationships P.

Despite their potential contribution to MRA, the use of 'omics' data in MRA has to date been limited. Therefore, the aims of this paper were to elucidate how omics data and the techniques used to generate and analyse such data can be used to improve and/or complement MRA, to identify where barriers may exist to the incorporation of omics data into MRA, and to consider where future omics data may prove useful.

The DRR is used to translate the exposure through the oral route into a risk of infection/disease. In classical MRAs, the DRR is based on human studies where different doses are fed to groups of volunteers (Ward et al. 1986 ) and the proportion infected (or ill) at each dose is plotted against the dose.

The histoblood group antigens (HBGAs) are glycans to which certain viruses, including NoV and rotavirus, selectively bind. HBGAs are present on both decoy receptors in the saliva and on mucin, the main protein component of mucus (Boshuizen et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2009; McGuckin et al. 2011 ). Shanker et al. (2011 propose that local flexibility in the viral capsid protein could allow the NoV to disassociate from salivary HBGA due to the pH change during its passage through the gastrointestinal tract. However, the molecular mechanism is not understood, and the problem for estimation of p 1 is that the effect of pH on protein structure is going to be very difficult to predict from gene sequences. A further complication is that while mucin production is increased during rotavirus infection through a mechanism involving the innate immune system, other pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori suppress synthesis of gastric mucin (McGuckin et al. 2011) . Thus, information on p 1 from one pathogen cannot be applied to another. Mucin glycosylation patterns change with age of the host altering the antiviral capabilities (Boshuizen et al. 2005; McGuckin et al. 2011 ) but providing a molecular basis for understanding of variation in p 1 with age of the host. The gastrointestinal tract microbiota prevent enteric disease by pathogens, including rotavirus, a trait referred to as colonization resistance or microbial interference (Wardwell et al. 2011) . However, the relationship between gastrointestinal viruses and commensal bacteria or how gut microbial populations affect infection by enteric viruses is not well understood (Wardwell et al. 2011) . Interestingly, the microbiota modulate mucin production and glycosylation (McGuckin et al. 2011 ) and therefore indirectly affect p 1 . Sequencing the human microbiome will provide a 'deep' genetic perspective on individual bacteria (HMP 2012), thus shedding light on the host-pathogen-microbiome interaction, although it will be difficult to translate this into an estimate of p 1 . The innate immune system provides an immediate defence for the host against pathogens in a nonspecific and generic manner. Central to the innate immune system is the recognition of specific, repeating structures (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs) on the pathogen by the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) of the host (De Koning et al. 2012) . A goal towards developing a mechanistic DRR would be to predict whether PAMPs on a given pathogen could be detected by the PRRs in a given host j. This requires an understanding of the molecular structure of the PRR in combination with its PAMP ligand. Crystal structures of PRR proteins complexed with pathogen PAMP ligands have been published (Takeuchi and Akira 2010) , and in combination with genomics, data could assist in predicting the strength of binding in different individuals. However, predicting effects of changes in gene sequence on binding may not be straightforward because although polymorphisms in host PRR genes attenuate recognition of pathogen PAMP ligands, the amino acids corresponding to these polymorphisms do not seem to directly contact the ligand molecules themselves in the case of Salmonella flagellin at least (Uenishi et al. 2012) . Indeed, the differences may be subtle because it is not yet understood how the innate immune system distinguishes commensal bacteria from pathogenic bacteria, that is friend or foe (De Koning et al. 2012) . Furthermore, there are numerous PRRs with each recognizing different parts of the virus (Triantafilou et al. 2011) giving alternative pathways, which will greatly complicate the estimation of the probability of a virus escaping the innate immune system prior to binding to its cellular receptor in step 2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 414, "end": 437, "text": "(Boshuizen et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 438, "end": 456, "text": "Huang et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 457, "end": 477, "text": "McGuckin et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 478, "end": 501, "text": ").

The ultimate goal would be to predict pathogen binding on the basis of nucleotide sequences of the viral capsid protein and the known (or ultimately predicted) structures of the HBGA glycan receptors. However, despite high conservation of the amino acid residues of the viral capsid protein that interact with HBGA, sequence similarity is not a predictor of the HBGA binding pattern (Bull and White 2011) . Indeed, closely related capsids can display distinct HBGA binding patterns, whereas genetically unrelated capsids from separate genogroups can display comparable HBGA binding patterns (Bull and White 2011) . This will complicate the application of omics approaches to predicting pathogen specificity from viral protein sequences, and hence estimating p 2 . Further complications are that structures of NoV from genogroups GI and GII in complex with HBGAs reveal different modes of interaction (Hansman et al. 2011) , and NoVs recognize HBGAs in a distinct strain-dependent manner (Shanker et al. 2011) . The NoVs are constantly evolving with antigenic drift in the capsid protein giving different HBGA binding specificities Shanker et al. 2011) . Genomics data, together with crystal structure data, could be used to identify changes in surface moieties of viral capsids although interpretation of impact on function may be more difficult. An example of this has been observed by NGS of FMDV in laboratory-infected cattle (Wright et al. 2011) . The laboratory strain of virus had several positively charged amino acids in its coat protein selected for by negatively charged heparin sulphate in cell culture. In the cow, those positive charges reverted. While rotavirus targets the intestinal epithelium, it is not known exactly which cells in the intestine NoV binds to (Chan et al. 2011) .

These populations do not express the receptor required for NoV binding and are thus highly protected against NoV infection, that is p 2 % 0. Indeed, none of those individuals developed an infection after exposure, however large the dose of virus ingested. About 20% of Europeans are in this highly protected category (Kindberg and Svensson 2009) . De Rougemont et al.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 170, "text": "Lindesmith et al.

Thus, in the case of NoV, it may be possible to simplify step 2 into assuming that p 2 ? 1 for those individuals who are genetically susceptible in having a functional FUT2 gene, while p 2 = 0 for those who are genetically resistant through having a nonfunctional FUT2 gene. This simplifies the calibration of p 2 in the DRR into determining the proportion of the population which is resistant, an application to which genomics approaches are particularly well suited. However, the possibility that the pathogen could use alternative receptors would need to be eliminated, as in the case of the bacterium H. pylori, which is known to use other carbohydrate receptors in addition to HBGA (De Mattos 2012) such that p 2 is the sum of probabilities of parallel routes, each with a different p value. The breakdown of volunteer dose-response data of Ward et al. (1986) into a two component model has been proposed previously for rotavirus (Gale 2005) . However, unlike the case for NoV, there are limited molecular data on binding of rotavirus to its receptor or indeed on the genetic basis for variation between populations in susceptibility. Also, the binding process for rotavirus may be more complicated than for NoV with several cell surface molecules implicated (Isa et al. 2008 ) and evidence that rotavirus surface protein may open up tight junctions between cells in the intestinal lumen allowing access for binding to the basal side of the cell (Nava et al. 2004; Boshuizen et al. 2005) in addition to the apical side of the cell used by NoV.

This specific cleavage process typically occurs after the newly synthesized virions are released from the cells in the previous round of infection. The ability of the host cells' proteolytic enzymes to cleave the viral proteins may control entry to the cell in the next round of infection, as in the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, for which the tissue tropism and pathogenicity are determined by whether the host cells' proteolytic enzymes can cleave the viral haemagglutinin protein. This explains the ability of highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza strains to replicate in many organs outside the respiratory tract, thus defining their highly pathogenic phenotype (Chaipan et al. 2009 ). Predicting p 3 depends in part on being able to predict whether the viral protein is not only specifically cleaved (i.e. in the right place) but also efficiently cleaved. This is more of a traditional biochemistry/bioinformatics problem dependent on understanding the structure of the virus protein and the mechanism/specificity of the host proteolytic enzymes. Thus, for example, Misasi et al. (2012) found that specific differences in the requirements of filoviruses for a host cell proteolytic enzyme (called cathepsin B) are correlated with sequence polymorphisms at residues 47 and 584 in the viral glycoproteins. The use of cathepsin proteases as host factors for virus entry is a general property of members of the filovirus family. Those authors were able to predict that a newly identified ebola virus is cathepsin B dependent. This approach may be applicable to assessing cell entry requirements for other viruses in the future and would contribute to our understanding of p 3 in different host cell types. In this respect, the rate of cleavage in different tissues would affect the magnitude of p 3 . Cell entry by SARS coronavirus also requires cleavage of the virus spike protein by cellular cathepsin (Bosch et al. 2008) .

Indeed, transgenic expression of the appropriate receptor (step 2) may make a previously nonsusceptible cell susceptible (e.g. as for poliovirus (PV)) (Leland and Ginocchio 2007) . Thus, the default position for step 4 would be to assume that p 4 ? 1, and that viral RNA replication, capsid synthesis and assembly can occur in the host cell given the virus nucleoprotein core has gained entry through steps 2 and 3. Supporting this, replication of the viral RNA is performed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) present in the virus core, and synthesis of new virus capsid proteins takes place on the host cell ribosomes. Indeed, viral proteins seize control of cellular translation factors, and host signalling pathways not only ensuring viral proteins are produced but also stifling the innate host defences that limit the capacity of infected cells to produce virus (Walsh and Mohr 2011) . Understanding the regulation of these pathways may enable refinement of the estimate of p 4 . Thus, viruses commonly use host cell survival mechanisms to their own advantage and in particular the PI3K/Akt pathway, which suppresses apoptosis (programmed cell death) so giving time for completion of viral replication (Eden et al. 2011) . Phosphorylation of NoV RdRp by the host Akt pathway decreases the polymerase activity (Eden et al. 2011 ) and may be an antiviral strategy, which should be considered in estimating p 4 . Central to understanding virus replication in step 4 is the application of proteomics to determine protein-protein contacts in situ in the infected cell and thus how the individual virus proteins associate with host cell proteins and hence work together. It is envisaged that proteomic techniques could be used to identify hubs in virus-infected host cells in a similar way to those in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis (Marchadier et al. 2011) . Of importance for assessing the infectivity of a virus in terms of the DRR is how each viral protein interacts with the host proteins in the different hubs, many of which correspond to regulatory pathways (Marchadier et al. 2011) . A proteomic analysis (using mass spectrometry) of human host proteins associated with the RdRp of H5N1 avian influenza virus identified 400 proteins, which may have a role in the induction of apoptosis and in innate antiviral signalling or are cellular RNA polymerase accessory factors, that is, involved in the regulation of gene expression in the cell (Bradel-Tretheway et al. 2011) . Such proteomics data by identifying host cell proteins bound to viral polymerases and so defining protein hubs may enhance our understanding of virus replication and assembly and would enable qualitative refinement of the estimation of the p 4 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 206, "text": "(Leland and Ginocchio 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 360, "end": 387, "text": "(Leland and Ginocchio 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1101, "text": "(Walsh and Mohr 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1438, "text": "(Eden et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1544, "text": "(Eden et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2070, "text": "(Marchadier et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2302, "text": "(Marchadier et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2689, "text": "(Bradel-Tretheway et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Probability of replication within the host cell"}, {"text": "NoV is an example of an RNA virus. Indeed, many viruses which infect humans, including PV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have RNA genomes and differ from DNA pathogens such as bacteria and protozoa in that the replication of the viral RNA during infection of a cell (step 4) is prone to error (Smidansky et al. 2008) , so generating a cloud of mutants (i.e. the progeny virions differ in sequence, albeit by only one or two bases in 10 000). This is called a mutant spectrum and is central to quasispecies theory (Lauring and Andino 2010) . The key point is that the individual viruses excreted by an infected person in faeces or in vomitus, and therefore present in an oral exposure, are slightly different in sequence, albeit related. NGS (or deep sequencing) provides sequences for all the viral variants in an exposure together with their relative frequencies (i.e. the mutant spectrum) and has been used to detect minority sequence variants for a number of human viruses (Wright et al. 2011) . This is clearly an important first step for making predictions on the DRR. Indeed, NGS of RNA viruses recovered from an infected person may give an indication of the number of virions that initiated the infection and has shown that in the case of HCV and HIV, infection arises from a single variant often representing initial infection by one or a few viral particles (Wang et al. 2010; Bull et al. 2012) . Moreover, the infection process may represent a bottleneck such that only one or two viral variants in the exposure dose successfully establish infection . Thus, in the case of NoV, only minor variants at frequencies as low as 0\u00c101% were successfully transmitted to establish a new infection (Bull et al. 2012 ). This suggests the risk of infection from a NoV virion, on average, is approx. 0\u00c10001 (assuming the exposure dose was high, which is likely through faeces or vomitus, such that the complete spectrum of variants was present). If every NoV had a high probability of infection, then Bull et al. (2012) would have seen a range of NoV sequences in the infected persons corresponding to most of the individual virions in the exposure dose. Indeed, the two major variants in the donor person accounted for 99% of the variants but were not present in either of the two recipient persons. Similarly, for HCV, only one or two viral variants successfully established infection (Wang et al. 2010; . Wang et al. (2010) write that, 'nothing in our data rules out the possibility that many additional particles were in the initial inoculum but did not replicate in the new host'. This raises the question of how many viruses were in the dose in the original exposure event but had very low, or even negligible, probabilities of infection due to the bottleneck. The number of footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA molecules/ml of serum measured in infected pigs by RT-PCR is three to four orders of magnitude higher than the numbers of plaque-forming units (pfu) measured by conventional methods (Rodriguez-Calvo et al. 2011). Thus, each pfu 'dosage' in the human rotavirus volunteer study (Ward et al. 1986 ) may also comprise many individual virions, again consistent with the ID 50 being high in terms of virions. Thus, although Haas et al. (1993) estimated the risk of infection from one pfu of rotavirus to be 27%, that pfu may comprise thousands of virions. This is not inconsistent with the results of Bull et al. (2012) for NoV, which suggest the ID 50 is in the order of 7000 virions as only 0\u00c101% can get through the bottleneck and initiate infection. Thus, if the probability of infection by a virion is 0\u00c10001, then according to the negative exponential dose-response model, about 7000 virions would be needed for a 50% chance of infection. NGS data on the viral mutant spectrum give complementary information on some of the steps of the mechanistic infection process in Table 1 . Thus, Bull et al. (2012) speculate that only a few NoV variants can bind to HBGA in step 2 effectively filtering out the majority of NoV variants in an exposure (representing a bottleneck). Indeed, the minor variant transmitted differed from the dominant donor variant in an amino acid change directly adjacent to the primary HBGA binding site in the capsid. For HIV, the variants responsible for establishing infection in a new host have unique phenotypic properties that contribute to the establishment of infection with specific amino acids that increase viral entry efficiency (step 3) as well as unique glycosylation patterns that aid attachment to host receptors (step 2) (Bull et al. 2012 ). Thus, a challenge for developing a mechanistic DRR for initial infection is determining which variants are important for a given step (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 350, "text": "(Smidansky et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 547, "end": 572, "text": "(Lauring and Andino 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1030, "text": "(Wright et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1419, "text": "(Wang et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1437, "text": "Bull et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1749, "text": "(Bull et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2032, "end": 2050, "text": "Bull et al.

The spreading of PV, for example, to the nervous system is secondary to the initial establishment of infection in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, PV titres peak in the small intestine and brain at day 1 and 5, respectively (Vignuzzi et al. 2006) . Different individual progeny viruses in the mutant spectrum have different cell and tissue tropisms reflecting their specific gene sequences compared to the original infecting virus. Specifically, a PV mutant with a high-fidelity RdRp (i.e. produces a reduced range of variants) replicated in the small intestine, kidney and spleen but failed to reach the brain and spinal cord and to produce neuropathology in mice (Vignuzzi et al. 2006) . However, restoration of the standard mutant spectrum complexity by subjecting the mutant PV to chemical mutagenesis led to a neuropathogenic mutant spectrum with the virus reaching the brain and spinal cord (Vignuzzi et al. 2006; Smidansky et al. 2008 ). Thus, enhanced opportunities for co-operation between more diverse clades of mutant spectra (arising from the high mutation rates) facilitate the virus's reaching specific target organs, thereby increasing viral loads and chances of transmission. However, too much genotypic variability may retard the progress of the virus infection by producing too many defective variants (Smidansky et al. 2008) . A conclusion of Smidansky et al. (2008) is that RdRp fidelity is tuned by natural selection to achieve the optimal genotypic diversity in the mutant spectrum and, consequently, viral competitiveness in the dynamic and hostile environment of the host cell. Furthermore, the level of diversity and type of diversity needed may change in different tissues as different host challenges are encountered. It may also change during the infection cycle and may vary depending on the route of transmission (Wright et al. 2011; Bull et al. 2012) . Bull et al. (2012) speculate that deep sequencing may yet identify differences between NoV transmitted through faeces compared to those in vomitus, for example. The huge complexity of the interactions together with the lack of understanding of how RdRp controls fidelity at the molecular level (Smidansky et al. 2008 ) severely limits prediction of disease progression. A further complication is that the host response to pathogen is also dynamic with the host HBGA specificity to NoV changing over time together with changes in host mucin glycosylation during rotavirus infection such that the mucins become more potent in inhibiting the virus (Boshuizen et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 130, "text": "Smidansky et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 433, "end": 455, "text": "(Vignuzzi et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 874, "end": 896, "text": "(Vignuzzi et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1128, "text": "(Vignuzzi et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1150, "text": "Smidansky et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1552, "text": "(Smidansky et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1594, "text": "Smidansky et al.

The HLA proteins present viral peptides to the T cells in the acquired immune response, and it is well documented that individual persons differ in their HLA proteins and that some are more protective than others against viruses including HIV (Wang et al. 2012) , HCV, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex type 1 virus. Hoof et al. (2012) found that protective HLA molecules show a preference to present peptide fragments from conserved HCV proteins (e.g. Core and NS5B), while nonprotective HLA molecules preferentially target HCV proteins that are significantly less conserved (e.g. NS5A). Taken together, their analysis suggests that by targeting the most constrained, and thereby conserved, parts of the HCV genome, 'protective' HLA molecules reduce the potential of HCV to escape the cytotoxic T-cell response of the infected host. Thus, it may be possible to predict viral clearance from the type of viral protein, which is presented by the HLA. Carlsson et al.

However, predicting whether conserved or less conserved peptide fragments are presented by the HLA and the effectiveness of viral peptide presentation for the purpose of estimating disease progression will be difficult.

Here, the initial infection process in the gastrointestinal tract has been broken down into four mechanistic steps (Table 1 ). The breadth of the fields considered in these steps demonstrates the need for a multidisciplinary approach including not only omics data but also conventional biochemistry and molecular biology inputs, which provide detail on the molecular components of each step. Thus, currently protein structure determination by crystallography studies underpins our understanding of the specific molecular interactions (e.g. PRR with PAMP ligands in step 1 or NoV capsid binding to HBGA in step 2). The overall conclusion is that the molecular mechanisms of each step in Table 1 are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. However, omics approaches will make a major contribution to specific areas of the initial infection process in particular in accommodating genetic variation both in the pathogen and in the host population through extensive sequencing. The human microbiome should be included here too because the gastrointestinal microbiota play a major role in the protection against infection in step 1, although the molecular mechanisms are not established. Genome sequencing for individual humans enables identification of genetic differences between susceptible and nonsusceptible persons, and it may be possible in future to tailor risk assessment to different host populations in terms of genetic susceptibility to initial infection. A promising application of such genetic markers is to define the proportion of the host population, which is more susceptible to initial infection by a specific pathogen. Current examples include the FUT2 gene, which affects NoV binding in the gastrointestinal tract in step 2 and potentially polymorphisms in the host PRR genes in step 1 (Wang et al. 2011) . Thus, the great strength of genome sequencing is in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes in the host population rather than in predicting specificities of interactions from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. Indeed, even for the best characterized step in the infection process, namely NoV capsid/HBGA binding for step 2, changes in amino acid sequence cannot be used to predict changes in binding specificity and affinity. Furthermore, not only are there many gaps in our understanding of how the few viral proteins actually function and interact with host cell proteins but also there are often multiple mechanisms and alternative molecular pathways used by the virus, for example inhibition of host gene expression and translation by SARS coronavirus (Lokugamage et al. 2012) .

However, not all relationships involving glycans and omics data are as simple as this, and the link between a single mutation in a protein-coding gene and susceptibility to infection may be the exception rather than the rule. Glycans have complex structures which may be changed during infection as the host tries to evade the pathogen, and also during development of the host (McGuckin et al. 2011) .

However, although genomics approaches may enable consideration of the virus as a dynamic and evolving system, as opposed to a static single entity within the infected host, predicting the progression of an RNA virus in terms of its ability to spread to new tissues (e.g. nervous system) or to evade the host acquired immune system and so persist, resulting in chronic infection, is fraught with difficulties. This is due to both the complexity of the pathways and the nature of how variants in the RNA virus mutant spectrum interact.

Lack of knowledge on glycans together with difficulties in predicting the functional effects of amino acid changes in key proteins poses challenges.

The potential use of NGS to compare mutant spectra of viruses in the exposure dose presented by the infected donor and in the infected recipient as a method to give direct estimates of probability of infection should be explored further.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Cathepsin L functionally cleaves the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus class 1 fusion protein upstream of rather than adjacent to the fusion peptide", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Bosch", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Bartelink", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["J M"], "last": "Rottier", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "J Virol", "volume": "82", "issn": "", "pages": "8887--8890", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Homeostasis and function of goblet cells during rotavirus infection in mice", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Boshuizen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["H J"], "last": "Reimerink", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Korteland-Van Male", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": ["J J"], "last": "Van Ham", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Bourma", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Gerwig", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["P G"], "last": "Koopmans", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Buller", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Virology", "volume": "337", "issn": "", "pages": "210--221", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Comprehensive proteomic analysis of influenza virus polymerase complex reveals a novel association with mitochondrial proteins and RNA polymerase accessory factors", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Bradel-Tretheway", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Mattiaco", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Krasnoselsky", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Stevenson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Purdy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Dewhurst", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Katze", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "J Virol", "volume": "85", "issn": "", "pages": "6569--8581", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Structural basis for the receptor binding specificity of Norwalk virus", "authors": [{"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Bu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Mamedova", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Tan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Xia", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "X", "middle": [], "last": "Jiang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Hegde", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "J Virol", "volume": "82", "issn": "", "pages": "5340--5347", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Mechanisms of GII.4 norovirus evolution", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bull", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["A"], "last": "White", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "Trends Microbiol", "volume": "19", "issn": "", "pages": "233--240", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Sequential bottlenecks drive viral evolution in early acute hepatitis C virus infection", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bull", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Luciani", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mcelroy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Gaudieri", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Pham", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Chopra", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Cameron", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Maher", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "PLoS Pathog", "volume": "7", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Contribution of intra-and interhost dynamics to norovirus evolution", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bull", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J.-S", "middle": [], "last": "Eden", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Luciani", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mcelroy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Rawlinson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["A"], "last": "White", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "J Virol", "volume": "86", "issn": "", "pages": "3219--3229", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Codex Alimentarius Commission.
