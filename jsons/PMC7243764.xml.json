PA is a powerful preventive and therapeutic intervention for the most common pre-existing chronic conditions that increase risk of severe COVID-19 infections and mortality.2\n,\n3 PA's effectiveness in preventing and treating anxiety and depression could have worldwide benefits during this stressful global crisis.2 PA enhances the efficacy of vaccines,4 so active lifestyles will continue to be relevant through every phase of the pandemic. Worldwide, about 23% of men and 32% of women are at risk for the underlying conditions of COVID-19, severe COVID-19 infections, and stress-related psychological symptoms, because they do not meet PA guidelines, based on self-report measures.5\n,\n6\n",

As limitations are eased, policies related to indoor and outdoor PA places vary across jurisdictions.15\n,\n16 If spikes occur in COVID-19 cases and deaths, movement restrictions may be put back in place. It is unknown how long this dynamic ebb and flow of limits on people's ability to be physically active will last and what the impact will be on PA. There are many unanswered questions about how pandemic-related policies in each jurisdiction are affecting PA. Therefore, it is important to identify the most pressing scientific questions that could be translated to policy and practice aimed at favorably impacting population health outcomes.",

Thus, PA interventions likely need to be tailored for a variety of subgroups within each country. Although e-health modes of delivery seem most applicable when physical distancing is required, access to and cultural acceptability of internet-based technologies is far from universal, so other delivery modes such as print or telephone may be needed depending on the target group. A participatory co-creation approach is recommended, involving PA researchers, behavioral scientists, and community members who are on restriction, to design culturally appropriate and evidence-informed PA programs that could be delivered through e-health, print, or telephone media. Programs should include social interaction elements, as socialization is a key driver of PA for some individuals and cultures.47 These co-created PA interventions should be implemented on a broad basis and evaluated with outcomes including participation in programs, program satisfaction, and PA.",
