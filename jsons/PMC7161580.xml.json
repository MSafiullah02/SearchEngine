The interaction of these epitope candidates with the appropriate HLA was subsequently validated in a biochemical binding assay (15). Briefly, denatured and purified recombinant HLA heavy chains were diluted into a renaturation buffer containing HLA light chain, \u03b22\u2010microglobulin, and graded concentrations of the peptide to be tested, and incubated at 18\u00b0C for 48 h allowing equilibrium to be reached. We have previously demonstrated that denatured HLA molecules can de novo fold efficiently, however, only in the presence of appropriate peptide (16). The concentration of peptide\u2013HLA complexes generated was measured in a quantitative enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay and plotted against the concentration of peptide offered (15) (Fig. 2). Because the effective concentration of HLA (3\u20135 nM) used in these assays is below the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of most high\u2010affinity peptide\u2013HLA interactions, the peptide concentration leading to half\u2010saturation of the HLA is a reasonable approximation of the affinity of the interaction. An initial screening procedure was employed whereby a single high concentration (20,000 nM) of peptide was incubated with one or more HLA molecules. If no complex formation was found, the peptide was assigned as a non\u2010binder to the HLA molecule(s) in question, conversely, if complex formation was found in the initial screening, a full titration of the peptide was performed to determine the affinity of binding.",

In general, intermediate and high\u2010affinity binders have KDs better (i.e. lower) than 500 nM and 50 nM, respectively, and the higher the affinity, the more likely the peptide is going to be a T\u2010cell epitope (17). Table 1 summarizes the data for HLA\u2010A*0301 and HLA\u2010A*1101. The peptides are ranked according to the predicted affinity and with few exceptions, the top\u2010ranking predictions could be confirmed as bona fide binders. Thus, 11 of the 15 peptides tested for A*0301 binding and 14 of the 15 peptides tested for A*1101 binding bound with a KD lower than 500 nM. This would indicate that there might be even more SARS\u2010derived binders than the 15 per HLA supertype, which are predicted here.",

Eight of the nine HLA supertypes have been completed (as of December 2003): A1 (represented by HLA\u2010A*0101), A2 (represented by HLA\u2010A*0201), A3 (represented by HLA\u2010A*0301, and in some cases by HLA\u2010A*1101), A24 (represented by HLA\u2010A*2402), B7 (represented by HLA\u2010B*0702), B44 (represented by HLA\u2010B*4001), B58 (represented by HLA\u2010B*5801), and B62 (represented by HLA\u2010B*1501). A total of 952 peptide\u2010HLA combinations were examined. The performance of the prediction tools is high as 894 (94%) of the predictions could be confirmed. For the 120 positive binding predictions, 84 (70%) could be confirmed, whereas 36 (30%) could not; for the 832 negative predictions; 810 (97%) could be confirmed, whereas 22 (3%) were unexpectedly found to represent binders (however, only of intermediate affinity, data not shown). Although these observations are biased by the selection of the top\u2010ranking candidates, the present data demonstrate the selection and diversification power of the HLA system. Each HLA molecule selects a very specific peptide repertoire; for the top\u2010ranking peptides, only 22 (or 2\u20133%) of the 952 combinations involves cross\u2010responses, where a peptide predicted to be a top\u2010ranking binder to one HLA molecule turns out to be a binder to a member of another HLA supertype, i.e. it supports the contention that HLA supertypes effect significant diversification of anti\u2010SARS CTL responses. Conversely, the overlap between different members of the same HLA supertype appears to be extensive. Thus, 13 of the 15 peptides predicted to be good binders to A*0301 were found to bind to another member of the A3 supertype, HLA\u2010A*1101. Similarly, nine of the 15 peptides predicted to be good binders to A*1101 were found to bind to HLA\u2010A*0301 (Table 1). Thus, it may not be necessary to know the exact HLA haplotype of any single individual; one may still expect to achieve considerable coverage of the major human populations just by selecting good binders for each of the different supertypes. This could have important implications for vaccine development.",

            "text": "Once all nine supertypes have been tested, we would project to have found well over 100 different vaccine candidates. These would all have been predicted to be successfully processed by the proteasome and biochemically validated for HLA binding. Therefore, there should be a high probability that these peptides are indeed presented to CTLs. Once that occurs, there is an approximately 50% chance of being able to raise a CTL response (18). Thus, our data do in all likelihood include some 50 CTL epitopes. To identify these from the >100 binding peptides, one could search for the corresponding CTL reactivities in peripheral blood of SARS survivors using robust and reasonably simple technologies such as interferon\u2010\u03b3 secretion from stimulated whole blood T cells (19) (e.g. Quantiferon CMI\u00ae, Cellestis, Valencia, CA). This would constitute an important independent validation of both the proteasome and HLA predictors. Doing this in an efficient and timely manner would be of considerable importance, and one could suggest that such a strategy should be coordinated by the WHO and included in any future SARS\u2010like effort. Alternatively, one could use the biochemically validated peptide epitopes without further information. Most humans express six different HLA molecules, and it would be highly unlikely that one would have failed to identify at least one CTL epitope in given individual. A vaccine could be formulated as a polytope design where the different peptides are linked together such that the polytope contains one or more peptides for each HLA supertype (20). This would maximize the likelihood that at least one anti\u2010SARS CTL response is raised in any given vaccinated individual. With the number of possible epitopes available here, one could even formulate several different polytopes. Their availability would further increase the chance of generating a multi\u2010epitope response and this would reduce the risk of the SARS virus escaping immune attack. These polytopes could be administrated in several different forms such as DNA vaccines, virus\u2010like particles, immune\u2010stimulating complexes (ISCOMs), etc. (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27). These administration forms are ideally suited to exploit the potential of a fast epitope\u2010identification approach like the one presented here; however, they are still at the experimental stage. In this context, it may be worth noting that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has eased the regulatory requirements for the approval of anti\u2010bioterrorism vaccines.",

The bioinformatics tools currently being developed and perfected will be able to use such genomic information to predict immune epitopes computationally, and the corresponding immunological tools will currently be able to validate these predictions in a matter of weeks to months. We predict that epitope identification in the near future will be as fast as a DNA sequencing in handling whole organisms. With the dissemination of these tools, one could envision that clinicians and scientists anywhere would be able to analyze pathogens of their interest (or agent of bioterrorism, or tumor cell) for the purpose of fast identification of immunogenic epitopes (1). The timeline of the present SARS epidemic has demonstrated how fast modern science can identify a pathogen and decipher its genome. Using this information in a fast and rational design of vaccines, immunobioinformatics promises to take this development one step further.",
