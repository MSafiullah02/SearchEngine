She complained of a 6-day history of progressive vomiting and epigastric pain culminating in an inability to hold down any fluids. This was on a background of an uneventful laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for management of morbid obesity that was performed 6 weeks prior. Additional past medical history includes insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.",
