When systematically applying light microscopic techniques to search for and identify pathogens in the second half of the 19th century, Koch soon succeeded in describing precisely a number of medically important agents, e.g. Bacillus anthracis in 1876, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1882, and Vibrio cholerae in 1883 (Koch, 1912a, Koch, 1912b, Koch, 1912c). But, like others, he experienced the limits of light microscopy when studying what we know today as viral diseases. Fulfilling Ernst Abbe\u2019s early prophecies (Abbe, 1873), demonstrating sub-lightmicroscopic, ultrafiltrable agents only became possible with the construction of an entirely new type of microscope using monochromatic accelerated electrons instead of visible light for imaging (Knoll and Ruska, 1932, Marton, 1934, von Ardenne, 1940, for historical reviews see c.f. Ruska, 1979, Hawkes, 1985).",

Previous research on virus particles depended mainly on indirect analysis, e.g. filtration and sedimentation. By applying EM, virology made a great step forward, as it allowed the direct demonstration of the particulate nature of viruses as well as the description of their size and morphology, shown already by the first electron micrographs of poxviruses (von Borries et al., 1938). Within a short period of time a number of additional viruses and bacteriophages, as well as bacteria, were morphologically characterized (Kausche et al., 1939, Ruska et al., 1939, Ruska, 1940a, Ruska, 1940b, Luria et al., 1943) making insights into structure-function relations and classification of viruses possible. Immune EM techniques were also developed very early, based on specific antibodies as part of the preparative and analytical repertoire (Anderson and Stanley, 1941, von Ardenne et al., 1941).",

Although lacking today\u2019s contrast techniques, the early osmium smoking methods allowed the differentiation between the chickenpox herpesvirus and the brick-shaped smallpox virus directly from the patients\u2019 vesicle fluid (Nagler and Rake, 1948, van Rooyen and Scott, 1948, Peters et al., 1962; see c.f. Fig. 1\n). Heavy metal shadowing techniques, developed soon afterwards, permitted particle counting and the morphological assessment of purified virus and were of great scientific value (Williams and Wyckhoff, 1945). In virus diagnosis, however, shadowing often obscured viral structures because of the debris usually present in diagnostic specimens. The advent in the 1960s of both the negative staining techniques (Brenner and Horne, 1959; for review see Hayat and Miller, 1990, Bozzola and Russell, 1992, Harris, 1997) and easy-to-handle instruments encouraged a broad application of EM to routine viral diagnosis. In the following years, a great number of clinically important, previously undescribed agents, e.g. adeno-, entero-, myxo-, paramyxo-, and reoviruses, was identified, mostly from diagnostic cell cultures. By extensive sero-epidemiological and virus neutralization studies these isolates could be linked etiologically to respective disease. Scrutinized by EM, many of them were recognized as \u2018new\u2019 and morphologically distinct viruses. The differences observed in morphology were used as the criteria for virus classification (Tyrrell and Almeida, 1967).",

            "text": "In a number of clinically important diseases, however, e.g. hepatitis and non-bacterial gastroenteritis, cell culture isolation techniques failed to discover the causative agents. Though the transmissibility of a disease was clearly shown, some through the use of volunteers experiments (Reimann et al., 1945), sometimes without clear consent (Krugman et al., 1967), the presumed viral agents turned out to be non-cultivable. The hunt for these 'fastidious\u2019 agents went on for more than two decades and became successful only when direct EM was utilized in the 1970s to study also \u2018dirty\u2019 specimens like plasma, urine, feces (for overview see c.f. Almeida, 1983, Madeley, 1979a, Madeley, 1995). Hepatitis B and A viruses were then detected in plasma and stool specimens respectively (Dane et al., 1970, Feinstone et al., 1973). In the next few years several etiological agents linked to gastroenteritis were discovered: Using direct EM, rotaviruses were found to be a major cause of endemic acute gastroenteritis in animals and humans (Bishop et al., 1973, Flewett et al., 1973, Bern et al., 1992; for review see Kapikian and Chanock, 1996). Investigating a recent outbreak of diarrhea and vomiting at Norwalk, Ohio, Kapikian and colleagues detected small, round particles by immune aggregation and linked those structures to the outbreak (Kapikian et al., 1972). The capsids of Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses display only weak surface details (Fig. 2\nc), based on their nucleic acid composition, however, they are classified today as members of the Caliciviridae (Murphy et al., 1995, Caul, 1996, Kapikian et al., 1996, Middleton, 1996). Astroviruses were described (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975, Madeley, 1979b) as causes of endemic gastroenteritis in humans; later they were also found as common pathogens in poultry and mammals (review see c.f. Matsui and Greenberg, 1996). Also particles morphologically resembling the earlier described animal caliciviruses, i.e. showing the deep cup-shaped holes on the capsid (Fig. 2a), have been linked to cases of human diarrhea and vomiting (Flewett et al., 1976, Madeley and Cosgrove, 1976, Vinj\u00e9 and Koopmans, 1996, Wright et al., 1998; for review see c.f. Kapikian et al., 1996). Due to the lack of molecularly-based diagnostic tests, the majority of these uncultivable small spherical particles were tentatively assigned to one of two morphologically-defined groups (Caul and Appleton, 1982): either small round structured viruses (SRSV; Fig. 2) comprising the astro-, calici-, and Norwalk/Norwalk-like viruses, or to small round non-structured viruses (SRNSV), including the Parvo- or Picornaviridae, e.g. polio or coxsackie viruses, displaying a smooth capsid structure.",

These techniques have taken over much of the diagnostic EM\u2019s previous burden, although they are not a real substitute for and therefore not comparative to EM diagnosis: their objective, e.g. viral antigen or nucleic acids, or antiviral antibodies, differs from that of EM, the virus particle itself.",

During the second phase, so far the broadest application of EM in viral diagnosis, many new viruses were described. When electron microscopists in the 1970s also learned to study body excretous (Fig. 3\n), a number of \u2018new\u2019 etiological agents was discovered with many of them being diagnosed exclusively by EM (for review see Mahony and Chernesky, 1991, Madeley, 1995). The approach of direct EM was successful because many of these viruses, e.g. rota-, astro-, and parvoviruses are shed in high concentrations, often reaching particle concentrations of 1011 ml\u22121. The third phase finally is characterized by a marked reduction of laboratories performing diagnostic EM. Following the rapid development of modern test systems based on both molecular biology and genetics, the use of diagnostic EM has gone out of fashion. This loss of its use as a standard tool in viral diagnosis is more evident in human medicine, while the veterinarians are still thinking of EM as an universal, and therefore not too expensive, diagnostic tool. As a result of this decline in use, the quality of diagnostic EM laboratories lacking the daily routine is often decreased, resulting in further reductions in its use. To assess the future role of EM in viral diagnosis we would like to ask a number of questions, and without satisfactory answers to these questions, the future of EM as a constituent of the viral diagnostic armament appears dim.",

Differing in their objectives and their principles, their efficiencies must be compared with caution, e.g. one infectious unit detectable in cell culture might be equivalent to 10\u201310 000 \u2018physical\u2019 particles detectable by visualization, depending on the particle:infectivity ratio (Table 1\n). It is generally agreed that diagnostic EM with its rapid preparation and evaluation permits a very quick diagnosis (Gardner, 1977, Almeida, 1983). Another principal advantage compared to alternative test systems is the undirected \u2018open view\u2019 making this technique a \u2018catch-all\u2019 method: using diagnostic EM no prior selection of which virus to be sought is made or is necessary, enabling the detection of even unexpected viral structures (Madeley, 1995, Biel and Gelderblom, 1998). The current ICTV classification describes 75 virus families (Murphy et al., 1995) with 25 and 21 families representing vertebrate and human viruses, respectively. Because the virions of each of the 25 families of animal viruses display distinct morphologies, the particles can be assessed according to size and fine structure and grouped to one specific family out of the 25 a priori by the ICTV defined taxons. Assignment to a particular virus family often fulfills the immediate needs of the clinician. Thus, the present system of virus taxonomy justifies a morphology-based diagnosis. Several excellent atlases and textbooks on the fine structure of viruses and aspects of EM diagnostic virology present detailed information on the structural peculiarities and distinctive criteria (Doane and Anderson, 1987, Madeley and Field, 1988, Palmer and Martin, 1988a, Palmer and Martin, 1988b, Nermut and Stevens, 1989).",

Given the microscope, the only other major expense is the microscopist, who can be a senior technician provided there is a proper back-up; the consumables are not important in comparison. If the running expenses are low, EM should be used as much as possible, thus keeping pattern recognition capabilities of the microscopists high and the costs per specimen as low as possible. In addition, spending all the time on what is left over in clinical virology as \u2018difficult\u2019 specimens is worrying to the microscopists\u2014the simpler specimens often do not reach the EM.

Later, in 1977, the PHLS also set up an EQA for EM viral diagnosis (Reed, et al., 1985b). However, this program after 20 distributions was stopped in 1993. To our knowledge, no other EQA for EM diagnosis was available until our program started in 1994. Its aim is to evaluate, to monitor and to improve the quality of diagnostic EM.

These data confirm a need for this program.2.The efficiency of diagnostic EM depends clearly on virus concentration and purity. Some participants have had problems in differentiating between paramyxo- and orthomyxovirus, polyoma- and papillomavirus, reo- and rotavirus, coronavirus and \u2018normal\u2019 constituents, as well as SRS(N)Vs and normal constituents. \u2018Dual infections\u2019 with widely different particle concentrations are not always detected. However, the educational value of EQA are obvious, as shown by the overall performance index rising as well as the indices for the more problematic viruses (Table 5\n). To retain the capacity and a reasonable good expertise in EM virus diagnosis for future diagnostic needs, regular quality control regimes and educational efforts are necessary. These measures will help to keep EM viral diagnostics within the \u2018modern\u2019 diagnostic laboratory.\n",
