The first case of avian influenza A (H7N9) in a human in North America was confirmed in January 2015. This individual lives in British Columbia and recently returned home from a trip to China. The person in question did not have symptoms while travelling, but became sick after returning to Canada. The individual was not sick enough to be hospitalized and recovered. As precautionary measures, all persons in contact with the infected individual were monitored by public health authorities. Generally, the risk of Canadians getting sick with avian influenza A H7N9 remains very low as evidence suggests that it does not transmit easily from person-to-person. The majority of people in China infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) had previously been exposed to the live birds, mostly chicken.

Sneezing and coughing are two methods in which this type of illness can be spread. This differs from airborne transmission since the droplets are too large to remain in the air for long periods.Airborne transmission: a person can become infected from exposure to droplet nuclei and contaminated dust particles which are capable of staying airborne. Few diseases are capable of surviving airborne transmission (e.g. influenza, pneumonia).Vector-borne transmission: a person can become infected through contact with an infected animal or insect. Mosquitoes are the most common vector for disease in humans (WHO 2015b).",

Unlike hurricanes that have a definite beginning and end and can easily be seen as they develop and move, drought can develop slowly over time and impact many sectors of the economy in a systematic manner, thereby influencing many different space and time scales. However, drought can be viewed with respect to two general time periods. There can be acute and chronic drought events. An acute (or short-term) drought example can be seen through the Canadian prairie drought where the system is able to rebound when weather patterns return moisture. In terms of chronic (or long-term) drought, a dramatic example is the drying of the Aral Sea. In this case, drought has essentially caused a large water body to vanish, going extinct. In the case of long-term drought, there is typically irreparable damage and high unlikeliness of conditions to return to a pervious status.",

These weather patterns can be the result of longer-term variations in the earth\u2019s atmospheric patterns or alternations of the earth\u2019s circulatory system due to human activity. Hydrological drought is observed when restricted water supply becomes evident, especially in streams, reservoirs, and groundwater levels. This type of drought usually happens after many months of meteorological drought. The result of this type of drought has immediate impact to local hydrology of impacted areas that are reflected in biological activity and in some cases the economy and society. Agricultural drought happens when crops become affected and cannot support normal biological growth (function). This type of drought is by nature connected to both meteorological and hydrological drought controls. Lastly, socioeconomic drought relates to the supply and demand of various commodities impacted by drought. From a general perspective it is usually the last drought type to be measured as the immediate and arguably the most severe drought types have already wreaked much of the havoc.",

In 2001, Southwestern and Eastern Ontario had an eight week dry period in the middle of the growing season. During this period, agricultural drought became present and crops were severely damaged.

The lower numbers of the intensity scale generally deal with the manner in which the earthquake is felt by people. The higher numbers of the scale are based on observed structural damage. Structural engineers usually contribute information for assigning intensity values of VIII or above (USGS 2015a).",

Several studies have identified the Ottawa area as having the highest risk of an earthquake in Ontario. Although this area may have the highest risk within Ontario, it is classified as having a moderate risk compared to other parts of Canada. Since this is a heavily developed area, a significant earthquake close to this area has the potential to cause considerable damage to infrastructure, natural resources, and ecosystems. Several scientific studies, such as Ploeger et al. (2008), have noted that intraplate earthquakes are felt over a larger area than plate boundary earthquakes of the same magnitude. This is likely due to the relatively stable and un-fractured crust in the continental interior and the presence of soft and deep sediments in some areas. Soft and deep sediments can amplify seismic waves and this effect has resulted in areas of greater historical losses in eastern Canada.",

The susceptibility of people being killed or injured by falling debris such as glass, chimneys, book cases, and roof tiles is of concern during earthquakes as their risk is higher.

Several factors contribute to flooding in this area, including low-lying road and rail network crossing the Don River. The very nature of the valley is wide but not deep making it a non-confining valley, with sharp angles in many places, varying seasonal water levels in Lake Ontario, sedimentation concern, and potential of ice and debris jams (TRCA 2006). Additionally, natural creeks have been buried by sewer pipes, thus altering the natural waterways towards Lake Ontario and forcing existing rivers and creeks to overflow their banks (Young 2013).",

Being prepared for extreme storm events, such as a 500-year flood, is highly desirable because it would potentially allow adequate emergency preparedness but a cost benefit analysis is a must to determine feasibility of planning scenarios and resource allocation. For prevention strategies, a combination of adaptive designs and preparedness/response plans maybe the methodological approach to clear understanding of the regions evolving disaster response capacity. For example, using technological advances and social media, crowd sourcing information and implementing rapid (near real time) two-way risk communication will support efficient and effective response and recovery that allows a type of self-organizing in disaster scenarios.

Therefore, it is not possible to declare a hurricane deadliest ever or the most severe hurricane in history, as can be understood from Table 1.9. In this table, a top ranking hurricane based on the evaluation criterion may or may not acquire top rank based on another evaluation criterion. Table 1.9 clearly proves this point as Hurricane Katrina tops in three categories, Hurricanes Donna and Camille make it to the top rank in two categories each.Category according to the Saffir-Simpson scaleLowest central pressure (which defines the intensity of the hurricane)Maximum wind speed\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE)\nMaximum storm surge amplitudePhysical size of the hurricaneLoss of lifePopulation affectedNumber of coastal counties affectedEconomic damage",

This hurricane is the only recorded tropical storm that has caused sustained hurricane force winds in Ontario, Canada. There was severe flooding in Southern Ontario due to Hurricane Hazel and the Greater Toronto Area experienced the worst flooding event ever witnessed in 200 years. Hurricane Hazel\u2019s destruction was felt everywhere with bridges washed out and homes and properties destroyed. There were 81 deaths because of Hurricane Hazel and approximately 7472 people needed evacuation because of the hazardous conditions left in the aftermath. One of the outcomes of Hurricane Hazel was the reimagination of Southern Ontario\u2019s emergency preparedness in case violent storm events were to occur again that could transfer large quantities of water and debris. Thus, following 1954\u2019s impact of Hurricane Hazel saw the formation of conservation authorities and initiation of emergency preparedness measures and mitigation strategies in Ontario as a means to damper the effects of future storms and hurricanes. Following sections provide in-depth insights into monitoring and warning systems and flood plain development regulations for watersheds (HIRA 2012).",

The storm began developing in the central Caribbean region on October 22nd. Hurricane Sandy intensified into a hurricane as it reached Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. As Sandy moved, the hurricane amplified as it moved up the northeast of the United States until turning west toward the mid-Atlantic coast on October 28th. As seen in previous years, Sandy showed classic late-season hurricane characteristics in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. However, Hurricane Sandy changed and took a complex evolution not seen before. Hurricane Sandy intensified in size and strength while over the Bahamas, despite weakening into a tropical storm north of those islands. Hurricane Sandy\u2019s system gather more strength as it turned into a formal hurricane as it moved northeast on the US coastline, parallel to the southeastern US coast. During this period of the hurricane, it reached a secondary peak intensity of over 157 km/h while it turned northwestward toward the Mid-Atlantic States. Initial estimates in the US were near $50 billion, making Sandy the second-costliest cyclone to hit the United States since 1901. Sandy caused at least 147 direct deaths in its path, with 72 being in the US, making it the greatest number of direct fatalities in the US since Hurricane Agnes in 1972.",
