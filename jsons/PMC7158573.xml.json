An observational study of 899 patients hospitalized in Mexico between late March and 1 June 2009 showed that pandemic (H1N1) disproportionately affected young people. Fifty-eight patients (6.5% of those hospitalized) became critically ill, with complications including severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock. Among those who became critically ill, the mortality rate was 41% (Dom\u00ednguez-Cherit et al., 2009). The pandemic and its management have been the subject of an in-depth analysis commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), and that analysis proved prescient in more recent global outbreak events such as Ebola (WHO, 2005).",

In 1997 a small but lethal cluster of influenza occurred in children in a Hong Kong nursery. Of the 18 cases, 6 died (Mounts et al., 1999). Science shifted its understanding of influenza and recognized that flu could come directly from birds to humans. In fact H5N1, which emerged in 2003, acquired the popular moniker of \u2018Bird Flu.\u2019 The outbreak was curtailed through active surveillance, changes in practice, and poultry culling of live markets in Hong Kong. However, the outbreak proved a harbinger of more widespread recognition of \u2018Bird Flu.\u2019 H5N1 was identified through active surveillance of poultry and wild birds; waterfowl were particularly affected. Human cases were sporadic but carried a very high mortality rate (estimated at 60%) (Webster et al., 2006).",

The concept of a \u2018super-spreader\u2019 was popularized (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). This phenomenon was also described in a second scenario in Beijing (Shen et al., 2004). Traditionally infection has been characterized by a \u2018reproductive rate\u2019 which is essentially the rate at which an infectious case replaces itself. If the rate is 1, then there will be no spread, as the infection will simply stay the same absolute number as the index case recovers. However, if the rate is higher (i.e., >1), then spread into the population will occur as a single case infects multiple individuals so the number of cases increases. Super-spreaders seem to have high infection rates although the overall rate for the pathogen in question may be low. This has, of course, changed our assumptions for modeling disease spread in populations.",

With the explosion of global trading in beef after World War II, coincident with refrigerated transport, and the movement toward global free trade, the United Kingdom negotiated a timetable under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to scale down tariffs on beef, which heightened competition in the UK beef industry and increased pressure for more efficient and less costly production methods.",

The rendering or processing of carcasses of cows and other animals after the edible and usable bits of flesh and meat have been cut away has been done for centuries. And for decades, UK farmers used the meat and bone meal from rendering as a protein source for beef cattle. Historically, the rendering process was similar to pressure cooking \u2013 applying very high temperatures for very long times so eventually even the bones broke down into powder. It was an expensive, fuel-consuming, and time-consuming process. When a new cold vacuum extraction method of rendering was introduced requiring lower temperatures (i.e., less energy) and less time, it seemed a win\u2013win situation considering the increasing pressure on the UK beef industry in the face of global competition. But sometime after the new rendering practice was introduced into the United Kingdom, the prion disease known as mad cow disease emerged. The new process, discovered by UK beef industry, was not effectively disinfecting for prions. Existence of prion disease was unknown prior to its dramatic emergence, first in cows and then in people. The context is important to appreciate. Somehow the streamlining of the rendering process played a role. British scientists tested the new process by deliberately introducing animals with mad cow disease and assaying the resulting meat and bone meal product. They found that the newer rendering process does not remove the infection, whereas the older process did.",

In 2008 a new enzyme in gram-negative bacteria was detected which caused broad antibiotic resistance. This enzyme was produced by mobile genes that travel on plasmids. Plasmids are small circular DNA (genetic) packages, which are distinct from the DNA of the bacteria itself. These are mobile, with the ability to be taken in across classes of bacteria if and when they confer a selective advantage for survival, as in the case of antimicrobial resistance. The new enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi metalloproteinase-1) was traced to an infection that occurred in patients who had been treated in India. A more complete study of the epidemiology of this enzyme in gram-negative bacterial isolates from the subcontinent suggested a broad range of gram-negatives were affected (Kumarasamy et al., 2010).",

Whether or not the theses of the article prove true with further research, the work provides additional evidence of how extremely powerful interdisciplinary research can be toward solving the puzzles of emergent diseases in humans. In discussing the spillover of viruses from bats to humans, the authors write:Factors that contribute to the intrusion of bats into human living environment can be summarized into a \u2018push\u2019 and a \u2018pull\u2019 (Br\u00fcssow, 2012). A \u2018push\u2019 refers to the enormous demand for more space and resources brought by the human population explosion, which leads to the destruction of bat habitats and shortage of food. Natural environmental changes, such as typhoons and droughts, can also place stresses on bats. A \u2018pull\u2019 involves the living environments built by humans, characterized by urbanization, intensive agriculture and food animal breeding, which attracts bats into human living environments for an abundant of food supply.\n",
