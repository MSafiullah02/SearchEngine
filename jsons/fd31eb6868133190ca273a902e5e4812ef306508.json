This progress enables professionals to communicate, store information, and rely on digital software and hardware. Emails, text messaging, telepsychology/ telemental health therapy, electronic medical records, cloudbased storage, apps/applications, and assessments are now available within the provision of services. Of those mentioned, some are directly utilized for psychotherapy while others indirectly aid providers. Whereas professionals previously wrote notes locally, technology has empowered providers to work more efficiently with third-party services and solutions. However, the implementation of these advancements in mental healthcare involves consequences to digital privacy and might increase clients' risk of unintended breaches of confidentiality.

Mental health providers may also consider adopting phones that allow for end-to-end encryption of text messages by default [e.g., Apple's Messages to other iOS users; 19,22,23]. If end-to-end encryption is not possible with native software/apps, providers may choose to adopt alternative messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption [e.g., Signal; 22,24]. Finally, Drolet [22] advises that providers should be wary of claims of 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA; 25]-compliant' text messaging services (p. 2369). 'HIPAA-compliant' is not a regulated or certified term by the Department of Health and Human Services. Despite claims, providers concerned with compliance are encouraged to de-identify information when transmitted via text message [22] .",

Clients may videoconference in their home or workspace, making the private, session content potentially discernible to family members or colleagues. Moreover, some clients may need in-person assistance before engaging in remote therapy [34] . Practitioners should assess the confidentiality of clients in these situations and be transparent about the features and risks during informed consent processes [35] . . According to the latest estimates, 165,000-325,000 health and wellness apps are available, and over 10,000 apps are designed for mental health [37] . Mental health apps may include reminders and often require clients to record (e.g., written or audio) their symptoms for reviewing the past session or preparing for future sessions [38 ,39] .",

Providers should engage with relevant literature, attend conferences and continuing education opportunities, and solicit feedback from colleagues, as these actions will likely benefit their work and clients.

Psychotherapy 2019, 56:431-440 http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ pst0000272 The author spotlights the absence of technology considerations within APA's (2017) ethical sections and standards, noting inclusion of distance-based care within the American Counseling Association's code. Recommendations are provided to psychologists interested in implementing technology in practice, such as acquiring competence, discussing usage in informed consent processes, and researching the empirical support for apps. 32.

The authors report that couples work can limit privacy (e.g., not being able to isolate sound as well when engaged in telemental therapy), detract from therapist confidence in feedback processes, interruptions in local environment, and may involve greater risk to safety when domestic violence is present. 34.

Int J Law Psychiatry 2019, 64:198-204 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2019.04.002 These authors collected and analyzed 61 medical and mental health apps. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem for mental health, highlighting that most apps tend to focus on anxiety/panic (56%) and depression/mood (26%). In 2018, of the 44 apps on the Google Play store, they requested an average 7.6 permissions (e.g., device data, record audio, read/write storage, text messages, and contact lists). The authors note that improvements in privacy and permissions have occurred over the years, but many companies remain interested in data harvesting. Although older than two years, Jellins provides insight on current growth in the use of digital assessments, and is one of few peer-reviewed articles to highlight this new technology. The article acknowledges a study involving school psychologists, as they incorporate more technology in their schools. Initial reports suggested teachers involved in study appreciated the efficiency and productivity. Jellins noted that those involved in the study were cautious regarding data sharing practices, and worked to minimize (e.g., use initials) personal information shared with third-party services.",
