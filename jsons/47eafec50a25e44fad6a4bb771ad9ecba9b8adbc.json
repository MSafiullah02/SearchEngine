It is hardly surprising that challenging times such as these may induce states of both hopelessness and helplessness in trainees', who may still be finding their feet in the clinical world. Furthermore, extreme life stressors such as this may also cause us to 'rubber band' back to negative emotions from our own pastfurther compromising our mental wellbeing.",

Are junior trainees being provided with adequate supervision and support in these difficult times? And how do we decide between self-isolation and leaving units un-staffed?

These may be reasonable measures to ensure that patient care remains both safe and effective during these difficult times, but they do form a double-edged sword. Research has shown that time off is important (Etzion, 2003) . Holidays may lead to short-term reductions in stress levels, and a more prolonged reduction in the risk of burning out (Etzion, 2003) . Etzion defines burnout as \"a psychological strain caused by continuous Stressors which erode individuals' coping resources over the long term, until they reach the point of physical and emotional and mental exhaustion\" (Etzion, 2003) . To that end, the aforementioned measures may have the potential to prevent recuperation from workrelated stress and, subsequently, may lead to staff burnout and more \"No annual leave is allowed now.

Put simply, this refers to a mental state of helplessness, which has been induced through repeated (failed) attempts to escape a harmful situationthey have learnt that their fate is out of their control. Whilst the cancellation of leave and rotations may yet prove to be a short-term measure, it still holds the potential to induce helpless states in trainees. The development of learned helplessness, however, may be dependent on our next move, and Trusts' openness to the humanity of the individual circumstances of trainees. We have a duty of care to these trainees and, where possible, should strive to prevent a culture of learned helplessness developing.",

Goodman et al. defined resilience as \"the interactive and dynamic process of adapting, managing, and negotiating adversity\" (Goodman et al., 2020) . Various ways of promoting resilience have been suggested throughout the broad, existing literature. For example, Denkova et al. found that offering short-term training in mindfulness improved markers of resilience in firefighters (Denkova et al., 2020) . Furthermore, some research has suggested that feelings of empowerment and of belonging may help to promote resilience (Oldfield et al., 2020) .
