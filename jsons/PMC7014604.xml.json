            "text": "Decision-making in public health and health policy is complex [1\u20133]. Processes that consider evidence and other considerations in a structured manner require a careful deliberation of many and often conflicting normative and technical criteria [4\u201310]. The choice of which of these criteria should be employed in the form of criteria has a profound impact on the outcome of the decision-making process. In many decision-making processes directly addressing health, criteria have mostly been concerned with effectiveness and cost [10\u201313]. This is at odds with the complexity of real-world decision making, were normative and feasibility considerations may act as key drivers of decisions (e.g. infringement of population health interventions on individual rights or interactions of interventions with other components of a health system) [14, 15]. The values and perceptions of different stakeholders with respect to normative and technical considerations often vary greatly both within and across societies. As there are various reasonable and defendable perceptions of which values and principles should guide the decision-making process and as there is no consensus on the right or best criteria, reasonable disagreement about the right decision or action is likely in pluralist societies [16].",

But in various areas of public health policy and practice, such structured processes are relied on in the evaluation or comparison of alternative interventions or modes of actions. This inter alia includes the allocation of resources [9], the setting of research priorities [8, 17], decision-making about public health interventions [18], the assessment of health technologies for funding or reimbursement [19\u201321], or investment or disinvestment considerations [22]. Selecting the most appropriate and relevant criteria is a challenging but critical task in all of these structured decision-making processes.",

Other reviews have explored the criteria employed in the context of health technology assessments (HTA), which intend to examine social, economic, organizational and ethical considerations in relation to health technologies in a comprehensive manner [30]; these covered both the criteria to inform decisions about health technologies by national or sub-national HTA institutions [19, 31\u201333], and the criteria used for selecting the technologies or interventions a HTA is to be conducted on [8, 34]. In general, reviews have addressed criteria used for making decisions on funding or implementing health interventions or technologies [9, 10, 22, 35\u201338], prioritizing research topics [39\u201341] or coverage decisions [7, 12, 42, 43]. Reviews include criteria used on various levels of decision making (national, regional, or local), in different contexts (e.g. high- vs. low-income countries), and proposed by various stakeholder groups (e.g. decision makers, beneficiaries/patients).",

We used these\u2014what we refer to as\u2014criteria as level one of the category system. During the synthesis, we remained open-minded about revisions of the category system to be able to capture new considerations relevant for decision making in an appropriate manner. For the inductive approach, we started from the criteria as reported in primary studies and reviews and grouped similar criteria into groups of\u2014what we refer to as\u2014sub-criteria (level two of the category system) and decision aspects (level three of the category system).

Six reviews were framed in the context of multi-criteria decision analysis [6, 13, 23, 27, 28, 48]. Three reviews explored criteria used to guide investment or disinvestment decisions [22, 27, 37]. Two reviews assessed criteria to guide the selection of topics for HTA [8, 34], and eight reviews captured criteria used in HTA [8, 11, 19, 20, 31, 32, 48]. Four reviews focused specifically on the evaluation of or decisions on vaccines [4, 21, 47, 55]. 19 reviews exclusively included studies or documents from high-income countries while five had an explicit focus on decision-making processes in low- and middle-income countries [10, 35, 52, 55].

As an illustration, equity considerations can be framed as relating to the starting point (e.g. priority of a given health issue due to high health inequity), as an criterion of relevance to the implementation process (e.g. distribution of adverse events across all those affected by the intervention) or as an outcome (e.g. reduced health inequity several years after introducing the intervention). Further additional dimensions could be a focus on individuals, populations or systems (e.g. clinical health benefits for the individual, reduction of the disease burden of a population, or impact on the performance of a health system following an intervention). In the organization of the criteria, we kept such additional organizational dimensions in mind.",

First, a validated critical appraisal tool appropriate for the topic does not exist\u2014neither at the level of systematic reviews nor at the level of primary studies. Only three of the included reviews undertook some form of critical appraisal: Whaitaka et al. [36] and Burchett et al. [4] used an adapted CASP Qualitative Checklist and Niessen et al. [11] used custom quality-of-research assessment scales. Second, the low score of some of the included reviews is likely due to poor reporting rather than poor conduct (e.g. regarding pre-established methods, or data extraction in duplicate).Third, the value and relevance of criteria for a given decision-making process does not necessarily depend on the quality of the review they were derived from. For example, even if the criterion \u201cenvironmental impact\u201d was merely mentioned in a single systematic review of low quality, this would not invalidate its relevance for a decision-making process focused on interventions with pronounced environmental (adverse) effect (e.g. large-scale usage of DDT in malaria prevention).",

Second, the quantification of how often or rarely a criterion is used does not necessarily imply its relevance for a given decision-making process: we believe that relevance should be informed by normative considerations. Third, there is a pronounced heterogeneity in the included studies: this begs the question, whether a criterion used in decision-making in a local hospital should count as much as the criteria used in the health technology assessment process of a national or supra-national organization. Finally, the quantification of the use of criteria is complicated: not only were many studies cited in several included reviews [61], but some of the reviews referred to other reviews as their data sources [6, 38].",

We countered this potential limitation by thoroughly searching the references of all included studies, which yielded some additional publications.

For example, a focus on interventions targeting younger people may be motivated by their potential for achieving a longer life span (greater health impact) or to reduce productivity losses (positive impact on the economy). At the same time, \u201cage\u201d can be considered with respect to non-discrimination or equity: explicitly reflecting on age in order not to prioritize one group of people based on age as a characteristic (ageism).

To make the best possible use of this list, solutions to the challenges of selecting criteria, of resolving conflicts between criteria or their interpretation, and of identifying and appraising evidence towards these criteria will need to be found. The WHO-INTEGRATE framework seeks to address some of these challenges, by providing a set of criteria selected based on a strong normative basis and by offering a methodological toolbox, which suggests both comprehensive and pragmatic approaches to populating criteria with evidence [15].",
