During the past decades, the emergence of several highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses has demonstrated the fragility of the species barrier in protecting human and farm animal populations from pathogens that exist in the animal kingdom. While basic virological research offers the possibility to detect viral strains that are \u2018poised\u2019 for emergence and identify mutations that might promote pathogen emergence, accurate prognoses are confounded by our inability to predict disease severity and virulence. Importantly, viruses with identical genome sequences do not always cause the same set of clinical manifestations in humans. Moreover, the complex interplay between environmental, viral, and host genetic factors drives differences in interindividual disease progression, severity, and outcome. These factors change over the course of a lifetime and some, like individual health status, comorbidities, and environmental factors 1, 2, are difficult if not impossible to control. However, perhaps one of the most important key players in the fragile balance of microbial pathogenesis centers around host genetic susceptibility alleles that dramatically influence the course of disease in different individuals. In humans, a growing number of genetic factors like entry receptors, receptor-modifying enzymes, and innate and adaptive immune-related proteins that regulate influenza virus, norovirus, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, herpes virus, and other acute and chronic virus disease outcomes have been identified (Table 1\n; more detailed list in [3]).",

By far, most in vivo viral pathogenesis studies are conducted in inbred mouse models. Not only are the husbandry and breeding of mice cost-efficient, but genome sequences, as well as many species-specific immunologic, molecular, and biochemical reagents, are available to the research community. However, disease spectra in inbred mouse models are narrow compared with the diverse spectra noted in outbred populations like humans. For respiratory viral infections, additional phenotypic variations must also be considered, as mice do not sneeze, cough, or develop fever following infection. Rather, they exhibit loss of body weight, reduced respiratory function, and decreased locomotive activity. As human pathogens often replicate less efficiently in mice, it is frequently necessary to use mouse-adapted viral strains selected for increased replication and disease in inbred mouse strains, which may or may not replicate disease symptoms seen in humans [4]. The most commonly used parameters for viral infection intensity in mice are changes in body weight and survival rate. Detailed analysis of disease progression can be undertaken utilizing time-course experiments during which samples of interest are collected and disease kinetics revealed. Most recently, mouse genetic reference populations with diverse genetic backgrounds have been developed that replicate the genetic and disease outcome variability found in outbred populations like humans. These new platforms are further supported by technologies that allow targeted genetic modifications, enabling researchers to study how complex traits regulate microbial pathogenesis.",

Gene trapping by comparison offers the possibility to insert reporter genes into the gene of interest, disrupting its function. Both techniques require the DNA construct of choice to be transfected into mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), injection of screened mESC clones into a blastocyst, and transfer of this blastocyst into the uterus of the host animal. Most recently, innovative techniques like transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)\n[5] and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)\n[6] are accelerating the process of targeted genome editing, including the introduction of susceptibility alleles that improve virus replication and pathogenesis in the mouse [7].",

RI stains of mice are popular due to their long-term genetic stability, which helps in integrating data collected in different settings and reproducibility over a long time. The most extensively used mouse GRP is the BXD family of recombinant inbred strains. They are derived from a cross between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice [24]. To obtain an F1 generation, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice were crossed. The resulting F1 generation is mated to achieve the F2 generation, which is subsequently brother\u2013sister mated for at least 20 generations to generate inbred mouse strains with a fixed genetic architecture. Completely inbred strains are then called BXD strains, which are genotyped once (one animal per line, not every individual) and can be phenotyped indefinitely for every trait of interest. Currently, there are 156 BXD strains available [25]. For decades, recombinant inbred strains such as the BXD family have been used extensively as tools for genetic mapping of Mendelian and quantitative traits. To identify single genes that are responsible for the observed phenotype fine mapping, sequence analysis, expression profiling, and functional studies are typically performed [26]. However, the identification of causal gene variants remains challenging due to the large size and the number of genes under the identified QTL region, coupled with the fact that the parental strains were identical by descent resulting in so-called \u2018blind spots\u2019 for genetic mapping. Wild-derived strains other than Mus musculus domesticus need to be employed to cover those spots and increase genetic variation [23]. Various resources have been established to address this issue, among them the heterogeneous stock (HS), which is derived from eight founder strains (A/J, AKR/J, BALBc/J, CBA/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and LP/J) and maintained through random mating. No inbred mouse lines are created and therefore each mouse exhibits a unique combination of alleles with the goal of containing random variation similar to the human population [27]. The caveat of this mouse population is that every individual mouse needs to be genotyped, which might be too expensive for some researchers. However, genotyping technologies are evolving constantly and costs are decreasing rapidly.",

Use of an octoparental crossing scheme between genetically distinct mouse strains was proposed and modifications through the research community were integrated. Breeding of this novel GRP specifically designed for complex genetics started in 2002 [28]. The eight founder strains of the CC include three classical laboratory strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, and 129S1/SvImJ), which have been used extensively in biological research and build the genetic backbone on which most of the knockout mouse strains are generated. Moreover, two mouse models for common human diseases were included (NOD/ShiLtJ for type 1 diabetes and NZO/HlLtJ for obesity) to address research questions of comorbidities. The addition of three wild-derived mouse strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) not only increased the genetic diversity by adding new alleles that are not present among the classical inbred and disease model strains, but also covered different phylogenetic origins of the mouse species (CAST/EiJ \u2013 Mus musculus castaneous, PWK/PhJ \u2013 Mus musculus musculus) to encompass 90% of genetic variation present in the M. musculus species [23]. Accordingly, the CC population reaches a level of genetic diversity comparable with the diversity found in the human population.",

Candidate genes for various phenotypes, such as susceptibility to Aspergillus fumigatus infections [33], energy balance traits [34], differences in hematological parameters [35], susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumoniae\n[36], and neutrophilic inflammation due to house dust mite-induced asthma [37], were successfully identified. Moreover, mapping efforts revealed expression QTLs for extreme host responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infections [38], host response QTLs to IAV [39], and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pathogenesis [40]. A common observation in all of the studies was that pre-CC lines exhibit an enhanced phenotypic range compared with the variation observed in the eight founder strains or other classical inbred strains and that it was possible to dissect traits that were thought to be inseparably entwined.Box 1Ticam2 Plays a Major Role in SARS-CoV PathogenesisAs an expansion to their first paper identifying QTLs for SARS pathogenesis in pre-CC mice, the authors utilized an alternative genetic approach to understand host genetic contributions to the course and outcome of SARS-CoV infection [61]. Two pre-CC lines with divergent outcome after SARS-CoV infection were identified. CC003/Unc is resistant to SARS-CoV whereas CC053/Unc is highly susceptible. To dissect host genetic factors that lead to the different outcomes, these two strains were bred and 264 F2 animals generated. Loss of body weight, viral titer in lungs, pulmonary hemorrhage, and histopathological changes were analyzed at multiple time points after infection. Overall, F2 mice exhibited a broader phenotypic range than the parental strains. Five significant QTLs across all analyzed phenotypes were identified, one of which affected multiple SARS-CoV response phenotypes. This QTL (HrS5) on chromosome 18 (27.1\u201358.6 Mb) was selected for follow-up studies. Integration of different bioinformatics and database approaches led to the identification of Ticam2 as a highly promising candidate gene. Ticam2 is a toll-like receptor (TLR) adapter protein that had not been shown to play an important role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Utilizing another tool from the geneticist\u2019s toolbox, Ticam2 knockout mice (Ticam2\n\u2212/\u2212) were employed to investigate its effect on disease progression and outcome. Ticam2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significantly more weight loss, similar viral load in lungs on day 4 after infection (however, significantly higher titers on day 2 after infection were reported previously [8]), and similar histopathological findings but significantly increased pulmonary hemorrhage on day 4 after infection. Thus, the authors successfully showed that a screening approach in CC mice in combination with an F2 follow-up study can lead to single candidate genes that can be confirmed using reverse genetic tools. It remains to be determined whether allele swaps can be used to identify the allele driving this disease phenotype.Alt-text: Box 1",

Although classical approaches like cell culture experiments or knockout mouse studies have been successfully used to understand infectious disease pathogenesis, the contribution of variation in host genetics can no longer be omitted because it more accurately phenocopies the human condition and is critical to pave the way to personalized medicine. The hurdles for most researchers who are not using complex genetics until now are the lack of expertise in designing complex genetic studies and the inevitable bioinformatics barriers until now. However, complex genetic approaches become exponentially more valuable as data is accumulated and compared across experimental setups and pathogens and combined to gain deeper knowledge. In this review, we provide an experimental framework for the rapid implementation of complex-trait genetic strategies in the laboratory setting, including design of the overall study, best utilization of the CC resource, and ways to narrow down QTLs to pinpoint single candidate genes influencing the trait of interest (reviewed in [54]) (Figure 3\n).",

            "text": "The classic CC hypothesis is that \u2018my disease phenotype\u2019 is a complex oligogenic trait regulated by multiple genetic polymorphisms in different genes, which interact to regulate disease outcomes in natural populations. In a second step, the breadth and duration of disease-associated phenotypes is selected and measured in a subset of mouse strains, which typically is either a random selection of CC strains or the eight CC founder strains (RSV \u2013 Buntzman 2016, IAV [55]). Analyses of phenotypic baselines are crucial to be able to distinguish between phenotypes that are caused by differences in genome architecture or those that are related to viral pathogenesis. Additionally, multiple sample collection is advised to maximize phenotypic comparisons across the final population. This is important as it is impossible to predict phenotypic outcome as different gene variants segregate in the final population and traits that are closely linked might be broken apart. Another important factor that might complicate experimental design is the impact of known genes of major effect, like Mx1 for IAV [39] or Oas1b for flaviviruses [56]. Selection of CC strains that carry a variation at that locus or even a null allele might help to uncover rather small effects by other modulating genes. Utilizing up to eight different alleles at any given locus in the genome allows the discovery of gene of major effect-dependent and -independent processes (IAV [55], WNV [57]). There is a risk that genetic mapping might exclusively identify the gene of major effect if no attention is paid to these genes while selecting CC strains for the respective study. Genetic mapping offers the possibility to add covariates like batch effects to the calculation and randomization should be achieved whenever possible. Sample collection should anticipate that the CC model is likely to identify CC strains that progress to different stages in disease severity, replicating phenotypes seen in human populations and allowing the identification of susceptibility alleles that regulate disease progression from mild to severe to chronic infections in vivo. This is important as it has been shown that novel disease phenotypes might be discovered in the CC (severe neuroinvasive disease and chronic WNV infection [44]). New models for diseases that are completely unrelated (spontaneous colitis [41], human leukocyte adhesion and recruitment deficiencies [55]) or related to the study design (SARS-CoV [40], Ebola [42]) will generate a panel of variable disease-state mouse models that capture the different phases of disease seen in human populations.",

            "text": "After all phenotype measurements are obtained, genetic mapping is utilized to calculate the likelihood of every position in the genome being associated with the analyzed phenotype, and regions with the highest logarithm of the odds (LOD) score are identified as QTLs. Zooming into the QTL region, bioinformatics tools can be employed to generate allele-effect plots, which show the contribution of each of the eight possible alleles to the QTL. Analyses of allele effects are a good way to determine which parental alleles are driving high and low responses. Afterwards, variations that are unique to the identified strain can be analyzed utilizing the Sanger SNP browseri. Additionally, other resources, like BioGPSii or the gene browser included in Pubmediii, are of great use to gain information on known expression patterns and biological functions. In the line of a systems-genetics approach, transcriptional analyses can be used to identify differentially expressed genes or respective pathways influenced by a particular QTL (WNV [58]). However, these downstream analyses should only be performed on a subset of extreme phenotype samples, as this approach is highly informative and inexpensive. Using different pathogens for the same type of analysis can lead to the discovery of common or unique features across different viral species (IAV and SARS-CoV [59]). Additional tools of the complex genetic toolkit such as diallels of the CC founders and their reciprocal F1 hybrids allow the identification of different types of heritable effects (IAV [60]). Alternatively, once a highly promising candidate gene is identified the use of knockout mouse strains to validate the contribution of this particular gene to the observed phenotype can be used (SARS-CoV 40, 61). The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) will soon achieve its goal of having a mouse mutant or a targeted mESC for every gene (http://www.mousephenotype.org), providing a crucial resource for functional annotation and validation of candidate genes. Importantly, it has been shown that the genetic background on which the knockout is created plays an important role 62, 63 and with recent advances of CRISPR/Cas9 technology the development of the identical knockout on different mouse backgrounds may be achievable in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9-generated allele swaps between mouse strains offer enhanced specificity, applicability, and translatability compared with complete knockout of genes. Translational aspects can be addressed by comparing identified SNPs with human SNP and gene databases or conserved structural elements and functional motifsiv,v,vi.",

Systems-biology approaches in which a plethora of genetic and genomic (omics) data for the identical experimental condition is collected allows integration of data and offers the possibility of complex modeling and, ultimately, the identification of key factors driving differences in disease progression and outcome [71]. Being a relatively young and novel platform for systems genetics, the CC and its complementary resources have accelerated not only the identification of QTLs from a wide range of phenotypes but also pushed the development of genotyping and databases as well as bioinformatics tools [72]. We would like to highlight that the more that incipient lines of the CC are used in different fields to explore different phenotypes and answer different question, the more valuable the resource itself becomes (see Outstanding Questions). Data generated by laboratories from different fields might be of use for others, shortening their way to obtain results and saving money along the way.
