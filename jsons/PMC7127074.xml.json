Medicines, equipment, instruments and food are used while treating in-patients and out-patients at hospitals and clinics, producing a variety of waste materials. Waste materials generated at hospitals and clinics (medical institutions) are divided into infectious and non-infectious. The waste generated from the treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases may spread infection either through direct contact or indirectly through the environment. Transmission of infectious diseases is a serious matter. Therefore, an appropriate waste management system is essential. The World Health Organization, 1983, US Environmental Protection Agency, 1986, US Environmental Protection Agency, 1991, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1978, Germany (Muhlich et al., 2003; The Ministry of Environment, 2004), and many other countries have already established strict guidelines for the management of infectious waste materials disposed of from medical institutions.",

However, troublesome problems on management practices of infectious waste materials in medical institutions have been recognized by the agencies concerned (Miyazaki, 2001, Miyazaki, 2003, Miyazaki and Une, 2004a). In fact, medical institutions have faced difficult problems at many places regarding the treatment and disposal of infectious waste in practice. Furthermore, many articles reported technologies of disinfection methods in medical institutions (Haishima, 2000, Matsumoto, 2000, Takatsuki, 2000, Murata et al., 2004) and reports about a management system of infectious waste are rare (Hayashi and Shigematsu, 2000, Miyazaki, 2001, Miyazaki, 2003).",

However, not all medical institutions have obtained accurate information on each infectious waste handling business including their qualities (such as the number of years dealing in infectious waste and the existence of violations) and a treatment price. A contract with a dishonest business induces a cost for handling of infectious waste for as little as Yen 100 or less (Miyazaki, 2001). In such a case, illegal dumping often occurs.

Intensive education on proper infectious waste procedures should be provided through lectures, posters, and handouts. In addition, various reusable items, such as linens, should be positively utilized to reduce infectious waste materials. Both the education of personnel concerned (including medical staffs and waste workers) and accurate information on special infectious waste businesses are indispensable to appropriately treat and dispose of infectious waste. Moreover, monitoring workers\u2019 compliance and direct feedback of information, such as a disposal cost and a quantity of infectious waste, are also considered essential for the continued success in reducing infectious waste materials. The potential for causing infection varies greatly depending on the sharpness and quality of waste.

Infectious waste must be managed in accordance with the Waste Disposal Law of 2003 and the rules promulgated in 2004 by the Ministry of Environment. Infectious waste materials are to be collected and segregated from other wastes, and transported to incinerators where they are combusted by a special waste handling business with which a medical institution contracts. Disposal costs are, however, becoming expensive. Therefore, medical institutions should make every effort to reduce infectious waste generated in their facilities. Due to the increase in the quantity and to the diversified quality of waste materials disposed of from medical institutions, the management of such materials has become increasingly important in order to protect waste workers from infection. The revised regulation is expected to encourage the reduction of infectious waste and to protect waste workers from being infected.",
