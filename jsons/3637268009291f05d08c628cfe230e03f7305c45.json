It is characterized by the use of four different primers specifically designed to recognize six distinct regions of the target gene, and the reaction process proceeds at a constant temperature using strand displacement reaction. Quickness and simplicity is the advantage of the method. Amplification and detection of gene can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of samples, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature. The method was applied to two fungal infections; paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a deep mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Ochroconis gallopava infection. For PCM a combination of F3, B3, FIP, and BIP primers designed from the partial sequence of P. brasiliensis gp43 gene was used. The PCR products amplified by the primer set; F3 and B3 showed species specificity for P. brasiliensis and the detection limit of the PCR was 100 fg of fungal genomic DNA. The specific DNA banding pattern of P. brasiliensis was detected in the clinical and nine-banded armadillo derived isolates, paraffin-embedded tissue sample or sputum from PCM patient. LAMP method was used also for the identification of O. gallopava by using species-specific primer sets based on the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rDNA sequence. The method successfully detected the gene from both fungal DNA derived from brains and spleens of A. Sano",

The fungal species is treated as one of the highly pahogenic fungi categorized as biosafety level 3 as the same as C. immitis, C. posadasii, H. capsulatum, B. dermatitidis and Penicillium marneffei (Kamei et al. 2003) On the other hand, the identification and diagnosis of the above fungal infections with nonculture method seems to be very important to avoid laboratory infection (Kamei et al. 2003 , Umeyama et al. 2006 . P. brasiliensis is the causative agent for paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) endemic in Latin American countries. This fungus invades the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, mucosa, liver, spleen and various other organs of humans and dogs. In humans, the disease is characterized by two clinical forms: the acute or juvenile form (AF) and more frequently chronic or adult form (CF). The AF is prevalent in children and young people and presents a more severe and rapid clinical evolution with the involvement of multiple organs and adenomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, digestive disorders, osteo-articular involvement and muco-cutaneous lesions. The CF occurs mainly in adult males and has multiple forms, ranging from benign and localized (unifocal) to severe and disseminated (multifocal) disease that involves skin, mucous membranes, pulmonary and lymph node manifestations (Restrepo 1985; Franco 1987; Kwon-Chung and Bennett 1992; Brummer et al. 1993; Ono et al. 2003; Ricci et al. 2004) .",

Furthermore, detection of P. brasiliensis gene from the internal organs of wild animals that died in traffic accidents; guinea pig (Cavia aperea), porcupine (Sphiggurus spinosus), grison (Gallictis vittata) and raccoon (Procyon cancrivoros) suggested that the mycosis invades not only humans but also many mammal species, and is one of zoonotic mycosis (Bagagli et al. 2008) .",
