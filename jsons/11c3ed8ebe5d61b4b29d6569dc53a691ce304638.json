The basic reproduction number for the ith patch in isolation is obtained along with the basic reproduction number of the system of patches, R 0 . Inequalities describing the relationship between these numbers are also given. For a two-patch model with one high prevalence patch and one low prevalence patch, results pertaining to the dependence of R 0 on the travel rates between the two patches are obtained. For parameter values relevant for influenza, these results show that, while banning travel of infectives from the low to the high prevalence patch always contributes to disease control, banning travel of symptomatic travelers only from the high to the low prevalence patch could adversely affect the containment of the outbreak under certain ranges of parameter values. Moreover, banning all travel of infected individuals from the high to the low prevalence patch could result in the low prevalence patch becoming diseasefree, while the high prevalence patch becomes even more disease-prevalent, with the resulting number of infectives in this patch alone exceeding the combined number of infectives in both patches without border control. Under the set of parameter values used, our results demonstrate that if border control is properly implemented, then it could contribute to stopping the spatial spread of disease between patches.",

By early August 2006, this virus has caused at least 235 human infections and 137 deaths around the world (WHO, 2006) . Seasonal bird migration alone probably cannot explain the westward spread in Europe, so imports of poultry and pet birds must also be considered as factors that might lead to the spread of H5N1 through countries and continents (Butler, 2006) . Furthermore, its initial appearance on the African continent marks a huge leap in its geographical range, and opens up a whole new front where the vast bird reservoir could potentially spark a pandemic of human-to-human infections.",

            "text": "The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) global epidemic demonstrated the ability due to modern globalization of infectious disease spreading to countries in several continents within a matter of days. In its aftermath and with the potential threat of a flu pandemic, several models describing spatial spread of infectious diseases have been proposed. These include the use of general compartmental models incorporating multiple patches (cities, countries, etc.) to explore the dynamics of spatial spread of disease (see, for example, van den Driessche, 2003, 2006; Wang and Mulone, 2003; Wang and Zhao, 2004; Arino et al., 2005; Salmani and van den Driessche, 2006) . Examples of specific human infectious diseases modeled in this way include influenza (Hyman and LaForce, 2003) ; (Sattenspiel and Herring, 2003) and SARS (Ruan et al., 2006) In addition, patch models for animal diseases include foot-and-mouth disease (Chowell et al., 2006) and tuberculosos in possums (Fulford et al., 2002) In this work, we propose a multipatch model to study the spread of influenza among the patches. We add a subpopulation of partially immune individuals to account for this important feature of influenza. Although the model is intended to be used for theoretical studies of the spread of human-to-human influenza, it can also be used as a model for studying the spread of enzootic diseases such as avian flu among birds. Partial immunity might not be important for studies of infectious disease involving poultry bird populations where the birds are slaughtered for food after a fixed time. It nonetheless could be an important consideration for studies involving wild bird populations.",

The population in patch i is divided into compartments of susceptible, incubating (infected but not yet showing symptoms), infective (infected with symptoms), recovered, and partially immune individuals. Let S i , E i , I i , R i , P i denote, respectively, the associated population size. Then, the total population size in patch i is N i = S i + E i + I i + R i + P i for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. A partially immune compartment between the recovered and the susceptible compartments is introduced in an influenza model (Hyman and LaForce, 2003) to account for people who have partial immunity to the current strain of influenza from a previous infection by an earlier strain. We include this partially immune compartment, and assume that individuals in this compartment may become infected again (but with a reduced rate). Also, the partial immunity wanes, with these individuals returning to the susceptible compartment.",

Moreover, the disease does not cause death, and the population of each patch remains constant. Notice also that our patch model keeps track of individuals present in patch i at time t, but does not keep track of where an individual resides. Models that include this are developed in van den Driessche (2003, 2006) and Sattenspiel and Herring (2003) . In addition, Ruan et al.

Consequently, we can conclude that travel between the two patches may cause the disease to become endemic in both patches if the travel rate from patch 2 to patch 1 is sufficiently large and that from patch 1 to patch 2 is sufficiently small. The numerical simulation in Fig. 2 also shows that for the chosen parameters and keeping m E 12 = m I 12 fixed, an increase in m E 21 = m I 21 leads to a decrease in R 0 .

In the event that there is no travel of infecteds from patch i to patch j, then M E and M I become reducible and hence W becomes reducible.

If E 1 (0) + I 1 (0) > 0, then disease persists in patch 1 provided R (1) (2) 0 \u2248 0.36 < 1. Thus, the disease in patch 1 becomes endemic and the disease in patch 2 dies out very rapidly (see Fig. 10 ). (2) 0 > 1, disease becomes endemic in patch 2, but patch 1 may become diseasefree if travel rates give R (1) 0 < 1, even if E 2 (0) = I 2 (0) = 0 and E 1 (0) + I 1 (0) > 0 (i.e., patch 2 is initially diseasefree and patch 1 is not). As demonstrated in Fig. 11 , the disease persists in both patches; whereas in Fig. 12 , patch 1 becomes diseasefree very rapidly and disease persists in patch 2.

Dozens of countries also issued border control either banning travelers from entering or placing them under quarantine. See Ruan et al. (2006) for a study of a patch model for the spread of SARS. For our influenza model, from a public health point of view, it is imperative for the low prevalence patch to stop travel of sick (both incubating and infective) individuals from the high prevalence patch. Our results show that, for the parameter values considered, border control does not necessarily always have a positive impact on the overall spread of disease and it is more important to ban travel of infected individuals from a low prevalence patch to a high prevalence patch. Moreover, an increase of travel rates in the opposite direction (from a high to a low prevalence patch), while theoretically alleviating the spatial spread of the disease, may not be an implementable policy.",
