The first line of defence consists of the interferon (IFN) family of soluble cytokines. The IFNs have anti\u2010cancer, anti\u2010proliferative, anti\u2010viral and immunomodulatory functions1 through the expression of more than 300 IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs).2 There are three classes of IFNs which are produced by different cell types, bind unique receptors and have distinctive biological actions.3 Here, we focus on the type I IFNs, which are produced by most cell types and have potent, inherent antiviral activity.4 The type I IFN response is bimodal: first, detection of an invading virus leads to IFN production and secretion and second, IFN acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce ISGs, the products of which work collectively to disrupt viral replication and spread.",

They found that IFN\u2010mediated antiviral activity requires the mono\u2010ubiquitination of histone 2B (H2B) at lysine 120, a post\u2010translational modification associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, in both the transcribed regions and the promoters of ISGs. This finding is a novel and unexpected aspect of antiviral signalling. Additionally, they found that E1A disrupts the hBre1 complex responsible for H2B mono\u2010ubiquitination, preventing the expression of ISGs, and allowing viral escape of antiviral signalling.82 In another elegant study, Marazzi et al.83 demonstrated how viruses exploit epigenetic signalling to regulate antiviral gene expression. They found that the NS1 protein of influenza A strain H3N2 contains a short sequence that mimics the histone H3 tail. This permits histone\u2010modifying enzymes to act on NS1; accordingly, NS1 is both acetylated and methylated in infected cells.83 Modified NS1 associates with the human PAF1 transcription elongation complex, allowing the virus to hijack the host transcriptional elongation machinery. NS1 also disrupts transcriptional elongation at sites of active antiviral gene transcription, selectively impairing the expression of ISGs).83",

HCMV ORF94 blocks the expression and therefore the activity of OAS.87 Adenoviruses have an unusual mechanism for impeding OAS; they generate large amounts of virus\u2010associated RNA (VAI), which is processed by the host cell enzyme Dicer, producing small interfering RNAs.88 VAI molecules act as pseudo\u2010inhibitors, because they strongly bind, but poorly induce, OAS1.89 Instead of interfering with OAS directly, MHV uses its ns2 protein, a phosphodiesterase, to cleave 2\u20105A molecules, preventing RNase L activation.90 JEV NS2A physically interacts with PKR to impede its activation in response to various stimuli.91 Poliovirus overcomes the PKR\u2010mediated translational inhibition by cleaving an additional eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF5B, via the viral proteinase 3Cpro, creating a cleavage fragment that is able to rescue viral translation under conditions of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.92 Interestingly, the Ambystoma tigrinum virus, which infects ectotherms such as amphibians, reptiles and fish, was found to encode a protein homologous to eIF2\u03b1, called vIF2\u03b1H, which impairs eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation through the degradation of fish PKZ, a homologue of PKR.

Remarkably, HSV\u20101 stimulates the expression of a 56 000 molecular weight MxA isoform via alternative splicing, in the absence of type I IFN. This novel isoform of MxA, which associates with virion components and nuclear viral replication compartments, increases virus replication.94 HCMV has long been known to directly induce the expression of the ISG viperin in the absence of IFN production.95 Recently, it has been shown that via interaction with the viral protein vMIA, viperin is re\u2010localized to the mitochondria, where it disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and enhances viral infection.96 In fact, HCMV replication is decreased in cells lacking viperin. Rotavirus infection of intestinal epithelial cells leads to a strong induction of the type I IFN response, but instead of limiting virus growth, IFN signalling promotes rotavirus replication, particularly at the early stages.97 The proposed mechanism is that type I IFN increases PKR levels, which the virus somehow exploits for its own replication.97",

The suppressor of cytokine signalling proteins SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced by IFN, and directly interact with and inhibit JAK function in a negative feedback loop.98 The human T\u2010cell leukaemia virus type 1 takes advantage of this, using its Tax protein to both up\u2010regulate SOCS1 expression through NF\u2010\u03baB activation and to stabilize the SOCS1 protein.99 Surprisingly, SOCS was found to be required for Tax to impair IFN production, but was dispensable for Tax to block IFN signalling. Interleukin\u20106 up\u2010regulates SOCS3; intriguingly, amino acid substitutions in the core region of HCV both produce interleukin\u20106 via activation of the unfolded protein response and render HCV more resistant to type I IFN.100",

Detection of viral components by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leads to the activation of a variety of transcription factors. (a) Nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) is held in an inactive cytoplasmic complex via interaction with its inhibitor, I\u03baB\u03b1. Upon virus recognition, I\u03baB\u03b1 is phosphorylated in a process involving the regulatory component NEMO, leading to degradation of the inhibitor, freeing NF\u2010\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus and bind the IFN promoter. (b) Upon virus detection, constitutively expressed interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is phosphorylated by the kinases TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, leading to its dimerization and nuclear translocation. (c) Although IRF7 is minimally expressed in most resting cell types, low level IFN production induces IRF7 expression, leading to its phosphorylation by TBK1/IKK\u03b5, heterodimerization with IRF3, nuclear translocation, and increased IFN expression. (d) The constitutively nuclear ATF2/cjun is phosphorylated upon virus detection by stress\u2010activated members of the mitogen\u2010activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily, leading to the activation of the complex. Cooperative binding of NF\u2010\u03baB, IRF3/IRF7 and ATF2/cjun to the IFN promoter leads to full expression of type I IFN genes. Each of these pathways is subject to inhibition by viruses.",
