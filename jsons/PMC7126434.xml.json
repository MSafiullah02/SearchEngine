IAVs of H1\u201316 HA and N1\u20139 NA subtypes have been isolated from water birds such as migratory ducks, the natural reservoir of IAVs (Fouchier et al., 2005, Kida and Yanagawa, 1979, Webster et al., 1992).",

HA is initially synthesized as an inactive precursor HA0 and subsequently cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits by trypsin-like proteases of host cells (Sakai et al., 2014). The proteolytic cleavage of the HA molecule is essential for IAVs to acquire infectivity (Lazarowitz et al., 1973, Wiley and Skehel, 1987). HA1 is responsible for virus binding to sialic acid receptors on the cell surface, and HA2 mediates membrane fusion under acidic conditions in endosomes, thereby delivering the viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm of target cells (Matlin et al., 1981, Rust et al., 2004). NAs, expressed on the virion surface as tetramers, have sialidase activity that enables mature virus particles to be released from infected cells after budding (Colman, 1994, Webster et al., 1992).",

The nucleotide sequences of the HA and NA of these bat-derived influenza viruses (BatIVs) were divergent from all previously known IAVs and new subtypes, H17N10 and H18N11, have been proposed (Tong et al., 2012, Tong et al., 2013). However, infectious viruses have not been isolated yet. Previous studies by others tried to rescue BatIVs using a reverse genetics approach, but failed to generate infectious BatIVs (Juozapaitis et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2014). Thus, the information on the biological properties of BatIVs is mostly speculative and the possible functions of BatIV HAs and NAs are only hypothetical, based on structural analyses (Li et al., 2012, Tong et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2012, Zhu et al., 2013).",

We first observed the virions of these pseudotyped VSVs using transmission electron microscopy (\nFig. 1). We found that the virions of all of these pseudotyped VSVs showed characteristic morphology (i.e. a bullet-like shape) similar to parental VSV\u0394G*-G. It was noted that VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV HA and NA (Fig. 1A and B), HA alone (Fig. 1D and E), and NA alone (Fig. 1G and H) all had numerous spikes on their surfaces, as was the case with VSVs pseudotyped with IAV HA (H3) and NA (N2) (Fig. 1C), H3 HA alone (Fig. 1F), and N2 NA alone (Fig. 1I). Immune electron microscopy with anti-H17 HA and anti-N10 NA antibodies revealed that both BatIV HA and NA were efficiently incorporated into VSV particles (Fig. 1K and L). No difference was found in the overall morphology among these VSV virions. These data indicated that BatIV HAs and NAs were efficiently incorporated into the VSV particles.",

            "text": "IAV HAs are known to be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits by trypsin-like proteases to acquire the ability to mediate membrane fusion (Klenk and Rott, 1988). Western blotting revealed that both H17 and H18 HAs were cleaved into HA1 and HA2 by trypsin treatment (\nFig. 3A). Thus, we investigated the requirement of HA cleavage for infectivity of pseudotyped VSVs. As expected, VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV glycoproteins did not infect IndFSPT1 cells without trypsin treatment, in a manner consistent with other IAVs (data not shown), whereas trypsin-treated viruses efficiently infected this cell line (Fig. 2). These data indicated that the HA cleavage was a prerequisite for BatIV infectivity. Next, to clarify whether BatIV HAs was responsible for virus entry, VSV\u0394G*-H17N10, -H18N11,-H17, -H18, -N10, and -N11 were inoculated to IndFSPT1 cells and their infectivities were compared (Fig. 3B). We found that VSV\u0394G*-H17 and -H18 infected IndFSPT1 cells as efficiently as VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11, whereas the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with WSN or Aichi HA alone was much lower than that of VSVs pseudotyped with both HA and NA of the respective viruses. VSV\u0394G*-N10 and -N11 showed no infectivity, similarly to VSVs pseudotyped with NAs of WSN and Aichi. These results suggest that BatIV HA is the only glycoprotein mediating both virus attachment and membrane fusion and that BatIV NA is dispensable during the entry into cells.",

To investigate the requirement of endosomal acidification for BatIV HA-mediated membrane fusion, IndFSPT1 cells were treated with ammonium chloride, which is known to neutralize the pH of acidic intracellular compartments, and then infected with VSV\u0394G*-WSN, -Aichi, -H17N10, -H18N11, and VSV\u0394G*-G. Treatment of the cells with ammonium chloride markedly reduced the infectivity of VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11, as was the case with VSV\u0394G*-G, -WSN, and -Aichi, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that BatIV HAs require a low pH for membrane fusion, consistent with the other IAV HAs (\nFig. 4A). To obtain information on the biological characteristics of cellular receptors for BatIVs, IndFSPT1 cells were pretreated with tunicamycin, pronase, or neuraminidase (i.e., an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, mixture of proteases, and sialidase, respectively), and then infected with pseudotyped VSVs (Fig. 4B\u2013D). Tunicamycin treatment markedly reduced the infectivities of VSV\u0394G*-G, -H17N10, and -H18N11, but less significantly those of VSV\u0394G*-WSN and -Aichi (Fig. 4B). Preincubation of cells with pronase reduced the infectivities of the pseudotyped VSVs, except for VSV\u0394G*-WSN (Fig. 4C). Neuraminidase treatment reduced VSV\u0394G*-WSN and -Aichi infectivities, but interestingly did not affect the infectivities of VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11 (Fig. 4D). We confirmed that no remarkable cytotoxicity was observed during these treatments (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that BatIV HAs do not recognize sialic acids which are critical components of the IAV receptor and some other molecules such as glycoproteins may serve as BatIV receptors.",

Although the zoonotic potential of BatIVs has not been fully evaluated yet, recent studies generated reassortant viruses that had HA and NA gene segments of well-characterized IAVs (i.e., H1, H3, and H7 HAs and N1, N2, and N7 NAs) and the other gene segments derived from BatIVs, and demonstrated that the reassortant viruses replicated in cultured cells and caused severe disease in mice (Juozapaitis et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2014). However, characterization of BatIV HAs and NAs remains an open research problem, since reassortant viruses carrying the BatIV HA and NA gene segments have not been rescued due to the lack of information on cells susceptible to this novel virus. In this study, we first determined the potentially permissive bat cell lines using VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV HAs and NAs.",

While IndFSPT1 was derived from Pteropus giganteus (family Pterodidae), YubFKT1 and SuBK12-08 were prepared from bats belonging to the same species (Miniopterus sp., family Miniopteridae). Based on a phylogenetic study of bats (Agnarsson et al., 2011), Miniopteridae belongs to the same cluster as Phyllostomidae, from which H17N10 and H18N11 BatIVs were detected, little yellow-shouldered bats (S. lilium) and flat-faced fruit bats (A. planirostris), respectively (Tong et al., 2012, Tong et al., 2013). Thus, BatIV HAs appear to recognize cell surface molecules shared among the bats at least in Miniopteridae and Phyllostomidae families. IndFSPT1 should also have such molecules since it showed the highest susceptibility to BatIV HA-pseudotyped VSVs. It was noted that VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11 also infected MDCK cells, although less efficiently than these bat cell lines. This result might contradict a previous report that H17 HA did not bind to the surface of MDCK cells (Sun et al., 2013). However, it is conceivable that the binding affinity of BatIV HA to MDCK cell surface molecules is quite low and thus below the level of detection in the assay used in the previous study. In the present study, MDCK cells indeed showed much lower susceptibility to BatIV HA-pseudotyped VSVs than YubFKT1, IndFSPT1, and SuBK12-08. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to clarify whether MDCK cells express some BatIV receptor molecules shared with the bat cell lines.",

            "text": "It is known that VSV G protein and IAV HA recognize ubiquitous cell surface molecules for virus entry. VSV G recognizes various cell surface molecules and thus VSV exhibits remarkably robust and pantropic infectivity (Finkelshtein et al., 2013, Johannsdottir et al., 2009, Lichty et al., 2004, Roche et al., 2008). IAV HAs recognize sialic acids typically occupying the terminal positions of glycoproteins or glycolipids (Gambaryan et al., 2005, Suzuki et al., 2000). Accordingly, VSV\u0394G*-G, -WSN, and -Aichi infected all cell lines used in this study, whereas we found that VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11 infected only particular bat cell lines and that neuraminidase treatment did not affect the infectivities of VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11. This result was in agreement with previous results based on the crystal structure analysis and surface plasmon resonance of sialylated glycans with \u03b12,3-linkage or \u03b12,6-linkage (Sun et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2013). Glycan microarray analyses also showed that H17 HA did not display obvious avidity to any glycans (Sun et al., 2013). Interestingly, we found that the infectivities of VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11 were markedly reduced by the treatment of IndFSPT1 cells with tunicamycin, which inhibits N-linked glycosylation, leading to unfolding or misfolding of proteins and inhibition of glycoprotein expression. Pretreatment of the cells with pronase also reduced the infectivities of VSV\u0394G*-H17N10 and -H18N11. Taken together, our data suggest that some particular glycoprotein(s) serve as receptors for BatIVs.",

It was also shown that most of the amino acid residues responsible for NA activity were substituted, and proposed that N10 NA protein should be termed an NA-like protein (Zhu et al., 2012). In this study, we found that VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV NAs alone were not infectious, confirming that NA did not play a central role in IAV entry into cells. However, it should be noted that the production efficiency of pseudotyped VSVs bearing WSN and Aichi HAs alone was much lower than that of VSVs pseudotyped with both HAs and NAs, suggesting that NA activity facilitated virus release from infected cells and/or increased the HA function (Su et al., 2009). By contrast, no remarkable difference was found in the infectivity between VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV glycoproteins (i.e., HA alone vs. HA and NA). These data suggest that, unlike the other IAVs, the target molecules of BatIV HAs and NAs are different and that the \u201cHA\u2013NA balance\u201d concept proposed for IAVs does not be applied to BatIVs.",

(A) VSV\u0394G*-Aichi, -H17N10, and -H18N11 were treated with or without trypsin (final concentration 0.0005%) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and then mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. After SDS-PAGE, separated proteins were detected by western blotting with anti-H3 chicken antiserum and anti-HA2 monoclonal antibody 3N12-6-4. (B) VSVs pseudotyped with HAs and/or NAs of WSN and Aichi and VSV\u0394G*-H17N10, -H17, -N10, -H18N11, -H18, and -N11 were inoculated to IndFSPT1 cells. Infectious units (IUs) were determined by counting the number of GFP-expressing cells. Each experiment was performed three times, and averages and standard deviations are shown. Infectivities of VSV pseudotyped with NAs alone were under the limit of detection (\u2020). Statistical significance was calculated using student\u05f3s t-test (*P<0.01).",

IndFSPT1 cells were treated with ammonium chloride (A), tunicamycin (B), pronase (C), or neuraminidase (D) as described in Materials and Methods. Treated cells were then infected with VSV\u0394G*-WSN, -Aichi, -H17N10, -H18N11, and VSV\u0394G*-G appropriately diluted to yield 200\u20131000 IUs. The percentages of infectivity were determined by setting the number of the untreated cells to 100%. Each experiment was performed three times, and averages and standard deviations are shown. Cell viabilities were measured by the alamar blue assay (E). The percentages of fluorescence were determined by setting the number of the untreated cells to 100%.
