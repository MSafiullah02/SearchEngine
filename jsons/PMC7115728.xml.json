Since the spread of these causative microorganisms is mainly via airborne particles (mainly dusts) and water [1], it is of practical importance to develop filter materials for gaseous and aqueous treatment. The filtration materials are best to be nontoxic, especially for purification of domestically and medically used air or water. Moreover, in the sector of purification of microbe contaminated body fluids (blood, lymph, etc.), the optimal filtration materials should have enough biocompatibility with human cells as well. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a very promising candidate because of its excellent biocompatibility and nontoxic hypostasis with organic tissues [2], [3], and its adsorbability of bacteria and replication competent human virus [4], [5].",

The data of open porosity also indicate that the small pores produced by WS are mainly isolated pores when the content of WS is not very high (<60 vol%). With the increase of WS, to 80 vol%, for example, the number of small pores increases and those isolated pores are more likely to connect together, which results in the predominance of open porosity in total porosity.",

The ceramics produced by only WS generally have low permeability, while the ones produced by using IS have much higher permeability. For example, the sample W2 produced by using as much as 60 vol% WS only have a permeability of 0.11 \u00d7 10\u221212\n m2, but the permeability of sample I produced by adding only 30 vol% IS reaches 0.38 \u00d7 10\u221212\n m2. As the volume fraction of WS increases, the permeability of samples prepared by using also IS (M1\u2013M3) increases much faster than that of the ones prepared by using only WS (W1\u2013W3), and the same trend occurs to the open porosity of these two series of samples. These phenomena can be attributed to the channeling of the small isolated pores by the large pores that are produced by adding IS, as shown in Fig. 8b.",
