Data from these collections were used to examine spatial and temporal patterns in species assemblage structure and abundance. The years 2001-2005 were unusual because the EBS water temperature was 'warm' compared with the long-term mean temperature. In contrast, 2007 was a 'cold' year. The abundance of the five most numerous taxa at 12 stations common to all years sampled (1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005) 2007) were significantly different among years. Larval and early juvenile stage Theragra chalcogramma (walleye pollock), a commercially important gadid, were by far the most abundant fish in all years. Bottom depth alone best explained assemblage structure in most years, but in others, bottom depth and water column temperature combined and percent sea-ice coverage were most important. Abundance of T. chalcogramma larvae increases with water column temperature until 5\u00b0C and then becomes level. Higher abundances of Gadus macrocephalus (Pacific cod) larvae occur in years with the greatest percent sea-ice cover as indicated by GAM analysis. Larvae of Lepidopsetta polyxystra (northern rock sole) increase in abundance with increasing maximum wind speed, but decrease at a later date during the last winter storm. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that oceanographic conditions, specifically water temperature and sea-ice coverage, affect the spatial and temporal pattern of larval abundances.

ANOSIM is a nonparametric, multivariate analysis that uses permutation techniques to test for differences in species composition among years, analogous to a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the overall test was found to be significant, permutational pairwise multiple comparison tests were conducted. Wherever there were significant differences (P \u2264 0.05), a similarity percentages (SIMPER) analysis (Clarke and Warwick, 2001 ) was used to calculate each species contribution to the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, therefore defining the discriminating species that best explain each significant difference.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 21, "end": 27, "text": "(1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 28, "end": 34, "text": "(1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 35, "end": 41, "text": "(1998)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 42, "end": 48, "text": "(1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 49, "end": 55, "text": "(2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 56, "end": 62, "text": "(2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 63, "end": 69, "text": "(2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 70, "end": 76, "text": "(2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 77, "end": 83, "text": "(2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 84, "end": 90, "text": "(2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 91, "end": 96, "text": "2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 149, "end": 155, "text": "(1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 156, "end": 162, "text": "(1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 163, "end": 169, "text": "(1998)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 170, "end": 176, "text": "(1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 177, "end": 183, "text": "(2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 184, "end": 190, "text": "(2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 191, "end": 197, "text": "(2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 198, "end": 204, "text": "(2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 205, "end": 211, "text": "(2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 212, "end": 218, "text": "(2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 219, "end": 224, "text": "2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 893, "end": 918, "text": "(Clarke and Warwick, 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ichthyoplankton data"}, {"text": "Variations in abundances and lengths among all years were investigated for the five most abundant taxa.

Two of these, Sebastes spp. and R. hippoglossoides, are deepwater or slope taxa, the latter being a pleuronectid with a circumpolar distribution that might be considered an indicator species affiliated with colder Arctic water masses (Mecklenberg et al., 2011) . The abundance of R. hippoglossoides larvae declined somewhat during the warm period, suggesting a shift in prevailing oceanographic conditions (Fig. 10a) . More frequent occurrences during the warm years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) of larval L. bilineata, a pleuronectid with a more southerly range, may be indicative of a northern range expansion under conditions of rising temperatures (Fig. 10b) . It should also be noted, however, that occurrences of adult L. bilineata in AFSC groundfish surveys are limited to only five stations immediately north and east of Unimak Island (Fig. 1 ) and the individuals collected were relatively small and probably not of spawning age (D. Stevenson, AFSC pers. com.). However, it is possible that larvae originating from adult L. bilineata spawning in the Gulf of Alaska are transported northward through Unimak Pass and onto the southeast Bering Sea shelf, as the prevailing currents are often very strong here with considerable seasonal and interannual variability Duffy-Anderson et al., 2006) .

Lower larval abundances were also observed during the El Ni\u00f1o, with a return to previous levels the following year. Indeed, unique patterns were observed that appeared to be related to thermal conditions. Revisiting the 1996-2000 data examined in the initial study provided the opportunity to update some (Cartwright, 2009 ). This reduced the number of occurrences of Icelus spp. below the 4% threshold required for inclusion in the analysis. Psychrolutes spp. was included in the 5% group in the initial study, but only occurs in 2.6% of the 1996-2000 hauls in our taxonomically updated data set. In addition, Podothecus veternus was one of the agonid species collected in the recent sampling, not P. acipenserinus as previously reported.

It appears from our observations in 2007 that assemblage structure is more cohesive and boundaries between species and station clusters (groups) and oceanographic (thermal) fronts are more distinct than in 'warm' years. During the five consecutive 'warm' years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) , the early ice retreat likely led to low standing stocks of large zooplankton species, which may have limited overwinter survival of age-0 T. chalcogramma by depriving them of important energy-rich prey resources in summer and autumn (Hunt et al., 2011) . This hypothesis is based on more recent observations determining that cold conditions lead to greater production and availability of large higher-energy-content zooplankton such as the euphausiids Thysanoessa raschii and T. inermis and the copepod Calanus marshallae . Although 2007 was the first 'cold' year after a transition (2006, an average year, unsampled) it had the lowest age-0 T. chalcogramma abundance over the entire time series. In addition, overall zooplankton availability in 2007 was high, but survival of the age-0 T. chalcogramma was low compared with subsequent cold years 2008-2010 . One possible explanation for this is that the standing stock of larger zooplankton species with high lipid content had not yet fully recovered after several years of poor production to replace the smaller lipid poor species that were very abundant.

Moreover, observed trends in larval and juvenile abundance do not necessarily correlate with trends in age-1 recruitment estimates (Ianelli et al., 2010) , suggesting that other factors also play a role in recruitment. Nevertheless, our results show that the early life history stages of marine fishes do respond to environmental perturbations relatively quickly, in terms of both changes in their abundances and/or changes in their species associations. The data we presented here encompass late larval, transformation, and early juvenile stages, but the influences of gradual environmental change or irregular 'disruptions' on spawning behavior (timing), hatching, and survival of earlier stages must also be considered as there are remnant or linked effects to later stages.
