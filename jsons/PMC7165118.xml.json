            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) emerged three decades ago in the US and almost simultaneously but independently in Europe. The etiologic agents were identified shortly in the Netherlands and the US, and these viruses were named Lelystad and VR-2332, respectively (Benfield et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991). The genomic sequences of Lelystad and VR-2332 show only approximately 60% identity (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999), and thus PRRSV isolates are grouped to PRRSV-1 (formerly known as European genotype) and PRRSV-2 (formerly known as North American genotype), respectively. Since its emergence, PRRSV has been evolving greatly, and a recent variant of PRRS-2 in China shows much higher virulence compared to previous isolates (Tian et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008). Regardless of the genetic types of PRRSV, clinical manifestations are similar representing mainly respiratory symptoms in piglets and abortion, reproductive failure, fetal death, and congenital infections in pregnant animals (See a review in Chand et al., 2012).",

The viral genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule of approximately 15 Kb in length with the 5\u2019-cap and 3\u2019-polyadenylation (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000). The PRRSV genome contains 11 open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs 3 through 7, plus the newly identified ORF5a and ORF2 (TF) (Fang et al., 2012b; Firth et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011). ORF1a and ORF1b occupy 75% of the genome and overlap slightly. They code for two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, of which pp1b is translated by the -1 ribosomal frameshift in the overlapping region (den Boon et al., 1991). Pp1a contains four viral proteinase activities: two papain-like cysteine proteinases (PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2), poliovirus 3C-like cysteine proteinase (CP or PLP2), and serine proteinase (SP), residing in nonstructural proteins (nsps) 1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, and nsp4, respectively. The proteolytic processing of pp1a and pp1ab is reviewed elsewhere (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 2013). PLP1\u03b1, PLP1\u03b2, and PLP2 generate nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nsp2 from pp1a, respectively, and SP in nsp4 generates nsp3 through nsp14. Thus, a total of 14 nsps are generated from pp1a and pp1b by autoproteolytic processing. Two additional nsps have newly been identified within nsp2, and nsp2TF and nsp2N are generated by -1/-2 frameshifting (Fang et al., 2012b). The remaining 25% of the viral genome codes for nine structural proteins; seven membrane proteins (GP2a, GP2b[E], GP3, GP4, GP5a, GP5, and M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein.",

IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 are produced via the intricate signaling process in cells, and once produced, they are released from the cells and bind to their receptors on the same cell (autocrine) or neighbor cells (paracrine). The binding of IFNs to their receptors phosphorylates Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and activates signal transducers and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which recruits interferon response factor 9 (IRF9) to form an IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. ISGF3 enters the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated regulatory response elements (ISRE) of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) for expression, and ISGs are the major executors to establish an antiviral status of cells and to regulate other cellular functions (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014; Schneider et al., 2014).",

The suppression of type I IFNs is a tremendous benefit for the virus to survive during infection (Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2017). Six proteins of PRRSV have been identified so far as IFN antagonists and, thus the IFN suppression by PRRSV is polygenic; nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp4, nsp11, and N (Sun et al., 2012b; Yoo et al., 2010).",

Indeed, PRRSV nsp1 is a potent IFN antagonist (Chen et al., 2010) and also inhibits the NF-\u03baB promoter activation (Song et al., 2010). Nsp1\u03b1 degrades CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus and blocks the recruitment of CBP during the assembly of IFN enhanceosome (Han et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2010), leading to suppression of IFN gene expression. The CBP degradation by nsp1\u03b1 is proteasome-dependent, suggesting involvement of the ubiquitination pathway. Since CBP degradation is a nuclear event, nsp1\u03b1 is suggested to localize in the nucleus. However, nsp1\u03b1 does not possess a specific nuclear localization signal (NLS), and thus, nsp1\u03b1 may bind to other nuclear protein for nuclear transport. nsp1\u03b1 however contains the classical nuclear export signal (NES), and the nsp1\u03b1 nuclear export is mediated by CRM-1 (Chromosomal maintenance 1, also known as Exportin 1). Further studies show that nsp1\u03b1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the nuclear export of NSP1\u03b1 is necessary for its ability for IFN inhibition (Chen et al., 2016). Interestingly, nsp1\u03b1 binds to swine leukocyte antigen class I (SLA-I) and mediates the SLA-I degradation in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner (Du et al., 2016a). It is thus tempting to speculate that nsp1\u03b1 may have an ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.",

PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to result in IFN suppression (Beura et al., 2010). PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 degrades karyopherin-\u03b11 and blocks the nuclear translocation of ISGF3, thereby suppressing ISGs expressions (Wang et al., 2013b). A recent study shows that PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 disintegrates the nuclear pore complex (NPC) of virus-infected cells and blocks host mRNA nuclear export to the cytoplasm (Han et al., 2017). Subsequently, nucleoporin 62 (Nup62) was identified as the cellular protein binding to nsp1\u03b2, and the SAP domain in nsp1\u03b2 was determined as the region for Nup62 binding (Ke et al., 2019a). A SAP mutant PRRSV generated by reverse genetics replicates at a slower rate, and its titer is also lower than wild-type virus. Notably, the production of IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2, ISGs, IFIT-1 (IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats 1, IFIT-2, and IRF3 were decreased in nsp1\u03b2-mutant overexpressing-cells or Nup62-knockdown cells. This mutant virus was IFN-suppression-negative and host mRNA nuclear retention-negative, and in pigs, reduced the clinical severity and increased antibody responses (Ke et al., 2018). Evidently, PRRSV has evolved to adopt various strategies for immune evasion and enhanced replication during infection.",

Ubiquitination and ISGylation are important post-translational modifications involved in the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling pathways, and the OTU domain interferes these pathways to antagonize type I IFN production (Makarova et al., 2000). The DUB activity of nsp2 OTU interferes with the polyubiquitination process of I\u03baB\u03b1 and prevents I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, leading to inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Nsp2 inhibits IFN\u03b2 production by suppressing the activation of the IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB signaling (Li et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010). Contradictory data are available that nsp2 of highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV activates NF-\u03baB in cells by inducing I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and p65 translocation to the nucleus, and thus promotes the expression of IL-6, IL-10, and COX-2. The hypervariable region of nsp2 was essential for NF-\u03baB activation (Fang et al., 2012a). This finding was supported by Huang et al (Huang et al., 2014) that nsp2 of HP-PRRSV had no inhibitory effect on IFN\u03b2 production. The nsp2 function for the innate immune modulation needs to be clarified.",

            "text": "\nnsp4: PRRSV nsp4 is a serine proteinase (SP) and inhibits IFN\u03b2 promoter activity (Beura et al., 2010). Nsp4 did not hinder NF-kB phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation but antagonize IFN\u03b2 transcription in the nucleus (Chen et al., 2014b). The inhibition depends on the SP activity in nsp4. Studies also show that nsp4 cleaves NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) at a single site (glutamate 349) and thus suppresses NF-\u03baB activation and IFN\u03b2 production (Huang et al., 2014). However, a recent study showed that scission of NEMO by nsp4 occurred at two additional sites (glutamates 166 and 171) (Chen et al., 2019). This study further showed the NEMO fragment of residues 1-349 could activate IFN-\u03b2 transcription more robustly than full-length NEMO, whereas all other NEMO cleavage products were abrogated for the IFN-\u03b2-inducing capacity. Thus, NEMO cleavage at E349 alone may not be sufficient to completely inactivate the IFN response via this signaling adaptor. These findings suggest that the multiple-site NEMO-cleavage by nsp4 is critical for disarming the innate immune response for viral survival. Additionally, nsp4 suppresses IFN\u03b2 transcription by blocking NF-\u03baB activation (Chen et al., 2014b). PRRSV nsp4 of different pathogenic strains has a different ability to inhibit IFN\u03b2 expression. HP-PRRSV nsp4 has greater inhibitory effect on IFN\u03b2 than nsp4 of less pathogenic strains. As discussed above, nsp1\u03b1 binds to and degrades SLA-I (Du et al., 2016a), A recent study supports this finding that HP-PRRSV nsp4 also downregulates the cellular level of \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22 M) (Qi et al., 2017), which forms a heterotrimeric complex with the SLA-I heavy chain and plays a critica1 role in SLA-I antigen presentation. PRRSV nsp4 binds to the B2M promoter and suppresses \u03b22 M transcription. These findings imply that HP-PRRSV may modulate the SLA-I antigen presentation pathway, suggesting that the IFN inhibition by nsp4 is correlated with PRRSV pathogenesis.",

The N protein inhibits TRIM25 expression and TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress IFN-\u03b2 production. This study shows that TRIM25 inhibits PRRSV replication and that the N protein antagonizes the antiviral activity by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, further supporting that PRRSV N inhibits innate immune responses of the host.

PRRSV upregulates the proapoptotic protein Bax expression and causes cytochrome C release and caspase-9 activation (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007). In addition, the decrease of antiapoptotic protein and the increase of proapoptotic protein make an additional contribution to PRRSV-induced mitochondrial apoptosis (Yin et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2016). PRRSV also increases TNFR1/FasL, indicating the contribution of the death receptor pathway to apoptosis. Thus, a crosstalk seems to occur between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways for PRRSV-mediated apoptosis. GP5 was initially suggested as the viral protein for inducing PRRSV apoptosis (Su\u00e1rez et al., 1996), but it was not possible to confirm that finding (Lee et al., 2004), and instead, nsp4 and nsp10 were recently determined as the PRRSV apoptotic proteins (Yuan et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Yang et al., 2013). Three major MAPK pathways are described; ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2), JNK, and p38. The activation of MAPKs is a common event in response to viral infection (Fung and Liu, 2017; Nacken et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2009). During PRRSV infection, JNK is activated (Huo et al., 2013; Jing et al., 2014; Lee and Lee, 2012; Liu et al., 2017b; Yin et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2016), which is attributed to ROS generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Huo et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2012). The JNK activation by PRRSV also contributes to virus-induced cytokine production (Lee and Lee, 2012; Liu et al., 2017b). Changes in redox balance during viral infection are linked to viral pathogenesis (Lee, 2018), and an oxidative stress is induced by PRRSV in both cells and pigs (Yan et al., 2017, 2015). The increased ROS generation by PRRSV likely attributes to the elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is associated with the changes of heat shock protein 90 and caveolin-1 expression. Inhibition of ROS generation by antioxidant protects cells from PRRSV-induced apoptosis through suppressing JNK activation (Yin et al., 2012). In addition, decreased glutathione peroxidase is observed in PRRSV-infected pigs (\u0160tukelj et al., 2013), suggesting that inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activity may also contribute to oxidative stress by PRRSV infection.",

The downstream target for PI3K is the AKT kinase that exerts the antiapoptotic effects by either phosphorylating some proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins or activating transcription factors to upregulate antiapoptotic genes. For PRRSV, the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated at an early stage of infection (Huo et al., 2013; Ni et al., 2015; Pujhari et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014a; Zhang and Wang, 2010; Zhu et al., 2013). The Akt activation by PRRSV leads to negative regulation of the JNK pathway (Huo et al., 2013) and inhibits host cell apoptosis early in infection through inhibitory phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad (Zhu et al., 2013). Both FAK (Ni et al., 2015) and EGFR (Wang et al., 2016) are induced by PRRSV, which in turn contributes to PI3K/Akt activation. Thus, the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway inhibits PRRSV\u2011induced apoptosis and facilitates viral replication.",

The inflammation in the lungs by PRRSV stimulates the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to affected sites, and the recruitment of fresh target cells provides favorable conditions to PRRSV for replication. PRRSV activates NF-kB during infection (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005), and N and nsp2 have been reported as the activators, whereas nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp4, and nsp11 are known as the suppressors. The dual roles of PRRSV for NF-\u03baB regulation make the viral pathogenesis complicated. It seems that the suppression of NF-\u03baB leads to the suppression of type I IFN response (see the section \u201c2.1 Suppression of Type 1 interferon response\u201d), and the activation of NF-\u03baB results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. While the bases for NF-\u03baB suppression and IFN inhibition by PRRSV are well characterized, mechanisms for NF-\u03baB activation is poorly studied. Ke et al (2019b) recently described a molecular basis for NF-\u03baB activation by PRRSV. In that study, PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1) was identified as the cellular protein binding to N of PRRSV. Since PIAS1 can function as a repressor for NF-\u03baB, binding of N to PIAS1 releases the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB. As a result, NF-\u03baB is activated and triggers the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.",

The NLRP3 inflammasome is comprised of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), and caspase-1 (Jacobs and Damania, 2012). Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to caspase 1-dependent release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (Swanson et al., 2019). Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires two steps. The first step is the priming in the expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2 through the stimulation of NF-\u03baB in response to microbial molecules, and the second step is the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jacobs and Damania, 2012). PRRSV can activate the inflammasomes in PAMs, and PRRSV induces IL-1\u03b2 production dependent on TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and the NLRP3 inflammasome (Bi et al., 2014). Viral RNA can be sensed by cytosolic RNA sensor DDX19A to activate NLRP3 inflammasome (Li et al., 2015a). Viral proteins can also regulate NLRP3 inflammation. The E protein of PRRSV has been shown to increase the IL-1\u03b2 release from LPS-primed PAMs (Zhang et al., 2013), while PRRSV nsp11 inhibits the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in PAMs. The endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 is essential for inhibition of IL-1\u03b2 production (Wang et al., 2015a) and NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia (Chen et al., 2018).",

Other studies report that PRRSV N protein induces IL-10 expression in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Wongyanin et al., 2012). Besides, the integrity of N is essential for IL-10 upregulation (Yu et al., 2017).

The IL-17 expression was dependent on C/EBP\u03b2 and CREB binding motif in IL-17 promoter (Wang et al., 2019c). PRRSV nsp11 was the viral protein for IL-17 induction, and Ser74 and Phe76 in nsp11 was indispensable. IL-17 production by nsp11 was also dependent on the PI3K-p38MAPK-C/EBP\u03b2/CREB pathways.

TNF-\u03b1 promotes an antiviral state in uninfected cells, recruitments of lymphocytes to infection sites, cytolysis of virus-infected cells, and modulation of apoptosis and cell survival (Natoli et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1994; Toews, 2001). Addition of recombinant porcine TNF-\u03b1 to cultures reduces PRRSV replication (L\u00f3pez-Fuertes et al., 2000), and thus PRRSV may have evolved to adopt an anti-TNF-\u03b1 strategy. PRRSV nsp1 is involved in the down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 production. Both nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 subunits of nsp1 inhibit the TNF-\u03b1 promoter activation by modulating the NF-\u03baB and Sp1 promoter activities (Subramaniam et al., 2010). HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic-PRRSV exhibit differential TNF-\u03b1 expressions in PAMs. Hou et al ( 2012a) also reveals that HP-PRRSV impairs TLR4- and TLR3-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 release through altered ERK regulation. HP-PRRSV infection induces lower TNF-\u03b1 production in PAMs, compared with low pathogenic-PRRSV, which may partially contribute to the pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV. The suppression of TNF-\u03b1 by HP-PRRSV was mediated through inhibiting the ERK signaling pathway, and nsp1\u03b2 and nsp11 were responsible for the inhibitory effect on TNF-\u03b1 production induced by HP-PRRSV and the differential TNF-\u03b1 production in PAMs (He et al., 2015; Hou et al., 2012a).",

Autophagy regulates multiple physiological processes including apoptosis (Levine and Kroemer, 2019). Autophagy can either suppress apoptosis or promote cell death depending on the context. Viral infection can either activate or inhibit autophagy in cells. PRRSV induces autophagy to promote virus replication (Chen et al., 2017a; Chen et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016b; Liu et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012a; Wang et al., 2015b), and the inhibition of autophagosome formation using siRNA leads to decreased yield of PRRSV (Chen et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012a), and increased apoptosis (Zhou et al., 2016a), suggesting that the autophagy induction by PRRSV promotes virus replication and protects the host cells from cell death. In MARC-145 cells, autophagy can favor PRRSV replication by postponing apoptosis through the formation of a Bad-Beclin1 complex (Zhou et al., 2016a).

The ER is an organelle for lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, folding, and maturation. Cellular disturbances such as redox imbalance can cause accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins, leading to activation of an UPR. The outcome of UPR is mitigation of ER stress through blocking protein translation, increasing protein folding capacity, and promoting ubiquitination-mediated misfolded protein degradation, and reestablishing the homeostasis (Wu and Kaufman, 2006). Prolonged activation of UPR may result in cell deaths. For PRRSV, two branches of UPR pathways, IRE1-XBP1 and PERK\u2013eIF2\u03b1, are activated. The UPR induction by PRRSV contributes to apoptosis (Huo et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2016) and deregulates cytokine production in PAMs (Chen et al., 2017b). Further studies reveal that GP2a targets GRP78 for degradation (Gao et al., 2019). Moreover, the UPR does not inhibit but instead stimulates efficient replication of PRRSV (Gao et al., 2019). In response to PRRSV infection, induction of UPR has been found not only contributing to PRRSV-induced apoptosis in host cells (Huo et al., 2013), but also involving in the regulation of viral replication and dysregulation of cytokine production in PAMs (Chen et al., 2017b).",

The ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18) as a host restriction factor restricts PRRSV growth through alteration of nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 and p50 in MARC-145 cells (Xu et al., 2012). The tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins make up the largest group of RING domain-containing E3 ligases. TRIM proteins are key components of the innate immune system as a new class of host antiviral restriction factors (Hatakeyama, 2017). TRIM59 has been identified as a potential nsp11-binding partner to inhibit PRRSV replication in vitro (Jing et al., 2019a). TRIM25 also inhibits PRRSV replication whereas the N protein antagonizes the antiviral activity by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination (Zhao et al., 2019). TRIM22 can also reduce PRRSV replication through interacting with N protein nuclear localization signal (Jing et al., 2019b).",

RNA recombination has experimentally been proven by co-infections of cells or swine with two different strains of PRRSV (Liu et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 1999). During the recent epidemiological investigations, recombination has been detected between two wild-type PRRSV strains (Franzo et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2015), between wild-type PRRSV and MLV vaccine (Bian et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019a; Zhou et al., 2018) or between MLV vaccine strains (Eclercy et al., 2019). Distribution of PRRSV recombinants is wide geographically, including Asia, North America, and Europe. Recombination events are found within each genogroup of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, but no recombination has been reported between two genogroups so far. Resulting recombinants contribute to genetic variations and evolution of PRRSV. Some of the PRRSV recombinants exhibit enhanced pathogenicity (Kwon et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2015). PRRSV recombinants may reduce protective efficacies of vaccines and also bring a difficulty to epidemiologic monitoring.",

Putative recombination \u201chotspots\u201d have been investigated by comparing 10 different PRRSV strains (Kapur et al., 1996), and intragenic recombination or gene conversion has been found in ORFs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, but not in ORF6. Liu et al. (2011) conducted plaque-cloning of 352 isolates from pigs that were coinfected experimentally with two different strains of PRRSV and investigated recombination events by sequencing the nsp2, ORF3, and ORF5 genes from each plaque-cloned virus. Of 352 cloned viruses, 133 were recombinants, representing 38%, and among the three genes, nsp2 exhibited a higher frequency of recombination with more complicated recombination patterns. In an independent study (Yu et al., 2020), possible shared recombination regions were investigated by analyzing 355 complete genome sequences of PRRSV-2 determined during 2014\u20132018 in the USA and China. It appears that high-frequency inter-lineage recombination regions locate in the nsp9 and GP2a\u2013GP3 genes. PRRSV-2 in lineage 1 (L1) are found susceptible for recombination. The analysis of recombinants between the 1991\u20132013 data and the 2014\u20132018 data show a trend moving from complex to simple. The recombination pattern has been changed from the L8 backbone to L1 backbone during 2014\u20132018 in China, whereas L1 is always the major parent for PRRSV in the US (Yu et al., 2020). PRRSV nsp9 codes for RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which copies the viral genome for replication (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 2013), whereas GP2a and GP4 bind to CD163 which is the cellular receptor for PRRSV (Das et al., 2010). Thus, genome recombination in these regions may contribute to an increase in replication efficiency and cellular tropism of PRRSV. Recombination breakpoints seem to be random throughout the genome, and recombination variants may have a different ability of infection or replication. These recombination variants with increased fitness may become easier to survive in pigs and spread among pig population. However, the recombination variants with decreased fitness may be harder to infect or slower replicate in pigs. Following natural selection in vivo, the recombinant PRRSVs detected in pig farms are mainly the increased fitness that the recombination hotspots located in the regions related with viral infection and replication.",

            "text": "Although the genetic recombination of PRRSV is rather frequent, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus in the order Nidovirales, RNA recombination occurs via a copy-choice mechanism (Lai, 1992; Makino et al., 1986) in which viral replicase may jump from one template to another during RNA replication. Recombination may also be associated with following factors. Firstly, sequence compositions such as sequence homologies and secondary structures nearby the recombination breakpoints may affect the position of recombination. Secondly, recombination may be related to the discontinuous transcription of PRRSV since the leader TRS (transcription regulatory sequence) jumps to the body TRS for subgenomic RNA synthesis during the transcription process (Pasternak, 2001). Overall, the mechanism of PRRSV genome recombination remains unclear and needs to be elucidated.",

            "text": "Despite the tremendous research progress made in the past three decades for PRRS, the understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms for PRRSV pathogenesis is still limited. Furthermore, some of the research data are often contradictory to each other and difficult to interpret. For example, a large body of information has recently become available for miRNAs, and some miRNAs promote PRRSV replication while others inhibit viral replication. However, it is difficult to envision their pathogenic roles for PRRSV, and further studies are needed. In addition, several challenges and difficulties are faced with PRRS research. Firstly, suitable immunological and biochemical reagents and tools are absent for swine. The reagents and tests widely available for humans and mice are often less suitable, and cellular functions of many proteins of swine are not properly characterized. Secondly, standardized experimental animal models are absent for PRRSV. Many animal studies are conducted in commercial piglets rather than in specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs. These commercial pigs may have been infected with other infectious agents, which may affect the response to PRRSV and thus alter experimental consequences. Thirdly, strain variations of PRRSV seem to affect the host response greatly. Different strains of PRRSV can exhibit high sequence variations even in the same subtype and show different phenotypes (Rola-\u0141uszczak et al., 2018). Using different strains to screen common responses may be necessary to obtain unique strategies of PRRSV. High-throughput approaches including meta-transcriptomic sequencing and single-cell sequencing have recently become available, and such technologies will provide reliable and comprehensive genetic information on host cell response to infection. Whole-genome sequencing of pigs has recently been re-determined (Choi et al., 2015; Son et al., 2020), and comprehensive pig genome annotations are available (Li et al., 2020; van Son et al., 2017). Such genetic information will help us understand protein functions and host response to infection. With the advance of CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing, specific gene-knockout pigs can be generated rapidly. The studies show that the pigs lacking either CD163 cellular receptor for PRRSV or the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) of CD163 become resistant to both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 infections (Burkard et al., 2018; Prather et al., 2017; Whitworth et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018). Such a gene-editing technology will allow generating immune-associated gene-deletion phenotypes, and genome-modified pigs will be valuable tools to study the basis for pathogenesis. Better understanding of the modulation of host response by PRRSV in combination with reverse genetics may lead to developing new generation vaccines. Such molecular approaches will fill knowledge gaps and lead us to better understand PRRSV pathogenesis.",
