We are not as drastic in our sentiments today and we do not expel patients with infectious diseases. In fact, we admit them to suitably planned facilities and rooms and ensure that they do not cause unnecessary hazards to staff and other hospital users.",

When historical and traditional hospitals were built, there were minimal concerns of new emerging infectious diseases. Today, with a more progressive outlook, it is the fundamental requirement to adopt a holistic view of the design and management of hospitals. Designing hospitals to be open, public spaces can make it difficult to control the spread of infectious diseases. The ease of travel and transportation today helps people cross borders easily. They can harbor, carry or catch infectious agents readily. During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak it became clear that the multiple public entrances in hospitals make it difficult, and often costly, to control entry and thus infiltration of infectious diseases.[23]",

Even after initial completion of the hospital building, systematic data collection and feedback for addition, modification and upgrading of the infrastructure must be ongoing.[4] Built-in flexibility in design is becoming more crucial, mainly because technology is quickly obsolete and patient population is constantly changing. For example, single rooms may be more useful to have as they can be converted to isolation rooms more readily during an outbreak. Healthcare buildings are a complex environment with a need for specialized areas like high wear and tear areas, circulation areas, wards, specialized theatres and hazardous material chain of disposition. Choice of material and finish is also important and needs to be mainstreamed into the planning stages.[24]",

For existing institutions and hospital buildings, renovation and upgrading plans must incorporate the necessary changes. Among the various methods for infection control two important environment factors are isolation and ventilation. Infected patients or those highly susceptible to infection need to be isolated in private rooms with proper ventilation systems in order to stop spread and reduce the possibility of developing a new infection. Bronson Methodist Hospital in Michigan demonstrated that private rooms, location of sinks and air flow design have resulted in a 10-11% decline in overall nosocomial infections rate.[5]",

Many healthcare systems were overwhelmed by the SARS epidemic. The system design, public health functions, equipment and supplies as well as collaborative arrangements were either not in place or not in alignment then. Existing triage areas in the ED are often designed with patient flow and satisfaction in mind, rather than healthcare workers safety and protection. As air currents may transport infections, fever and high risk patients are now being managed separately from others. The febrile areas in the ED have undergone structural re-engineering and upgrading of the ventilation system [Figure 3]. There usually exist design flaws in many hospitals, such as turbulent ventilation across patient access areas, the flow of aerosolized gases between treatment areas and the shortage or absence of negative pressure rooms. Consideration of design, equipment and ventilation are important Building ventilation, whether natural or mechanical serves to dilute droplets nuclei in the air and is the single most important engineering control in the prevention of transmission of airborne infections.[6\u20138] In the new fever areas, rooms with negative pressure ventilation are now available. The exhaust rate in these rooms must exceed the air supply rate by a generous margin. Infected air from patients in this area is prevented from staying in the area and circulating in the corridor, by an exhaust system that filters it to the outside environment. During the construction phase, it is essential to consult the ventilation engineer with regard to the sufficient amount of flow without causing too high turbulence.",

A negative pressure room should also preferably have windows which do not open. Having ante-rooms too will help reduce the escape of droplet nuclei during opening and closing of doors. It must also be noted that patients and staff in negative pressure rooms are at increased risk in the event of a fire. This is because fire and smoke can be drawn into these rooms from the adjacent corridors or wards by reason of the differential pressures. The SARS virus is transmitted primarily by bio-aerosol droplets or direct, very close personal contact. During the outbreak when onsite measurement of bio-aerosol dispersion was done, it was able to predict the distribution fairly well, in agreement with the spatial infection pattern of SARS cases.[3]",

Hand washing has been recommended as the single most important practice to control hospital acquired infection. In isolation rooms, of observation and general wards, there are personalized hand washing facilities within each room to reduce cross-contamination. These isolation rooms help to prevent direct and even indirect contact transmission and droplet transmission. Access to examination gloves, alcohol-based hand-rub and trash containers or receptacle is also important. Many have the perception that unavailability or inadequate hand washing facilities and sinks contribute towards poor compliance. Few studies have prospectively evaluated the association between hand hygiene compliance and building plan and design. Lankford et al. found that hand hygiene compliance in a new healthcare facility (with more sinks provided) decreased significantly.[12] They concluded that peer and team behaviour have greater impact on good habits rather than just building design and ergonomics. This was echoed by a few other studies as well.[1314]",

The Framework advises on how to prepare and organize a primary care clinic for a pandemic; including modifications to clinic workflow and processes to avoid cross infection, use of personal protection equipment, hospital referral and environmental design and cleaning.[17] Both infrastructure and design have a significant effect on our work in the healthcare sectors. This issue has often been taken for granted but now is the time to make it work for us and our patients.",
