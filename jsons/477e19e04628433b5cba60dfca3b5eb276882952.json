People's hard-earned money, their personal information, identity, and health are at a higher risk than ever due to the misuse of technology in doing forgery. However, the technology can also be used as an answer to counteracting against fraudulence prevalent in affairs from every walk of life. This short paper attempts to present the blockchain technology as a solution to overcome the menace of forgery by promoting trustless computing in business transactions. The paper explains the blockchain technology and a variety of its implementation through five different use cases in the field of drug supply chain, health insurance, land record management, courier services, and immigration records. The immigration blockchain is also proposed as a solution to check pandemic like the coronavirus (COVID-19) effectively. The implementation of the Blockchain is performed using a locally built IBM's hyper-ledger fabricbased platform, and Ethereum public platform. The results are encouraging enough to substitute existing business operations using Blockchain-based solutions.",

PoW is used as a disincentive for the attackers, and thus provide security to the network [3] . Due to the high cost of computing power involved in PoW, the industry is looking towards other consensus approaches like proof-of-stake (PoS). Private Blockchain, on the other hand, becomes selective in giving permissions to participate, and resort to a mechanism called a selective endorsement, in which some predetermined endorsers are made responsible for validating or invalidating a transaction. Performance-wise, private blockchains have higher transaction throughput than public blockchains, which need more time and computation power to approve a transaction owing to PoW.",

This happens when a patient is admitted to the hospital, and the caretakers are told to purchase unnecessary medication [4] . Later those medicines are smuggled back to the drug store, by the staff, in the hospital premises. Consider a Blockchain-based solution, where each drug sachet bears a QR Code that can be scanned through an authorized mobile app. Any customer may check the authenticity of the drug he or she purchases, as the provenance of the drug is traceable. Also, once a drug is sold against a prescription, the same is recorded on a public ledger, making it impossible to resell with a bill.",

(2) People hide their old diseases and treatments undergone at the time of buying new health policies, in order to avoid the increased premium cost. If a nation-wide blockchain is prepared that will register the birth, vaccination, medical treatments, and even death registration, the chances to hide pre-existing diseases and treatment would become difficult.

We assume that immigration checkpoints are located at all international airports, seaports, and roadway borders. Whenever an immigrant enters, their entry is recorded on a public ledger used by all the participating countries. Every such entry is a new transaction requested by the client node. This request goes to the endorsing nodes (see Fig. 1 ) where smart contracts get executed, and the request is then sent back to the client nodes with an endorsement. By this time, no ledger update takes place. The client then sends the endorsed request to the ordering nodes, where PBFT or Noop algorithm works to assign an existing block or a new block to a transaction. Afterward, the news about the newly created block is broken out to the adjoining peers (committing nodes and endorsers), and all the nodes update their Blockchain accordingly; thus, a consistent ledger is 1  1  1  1  10  9  9  3  1  1  9  9  2  2  2  1  8  7  10  3  2  2  7  8  3  2  3  1  9  7  11  3  2  1  6  7  4  2  4  2  5  6  12  3  3  2  6  6  5  2  4  1  5  5  13  3  3  1  6  6  6  2  5  2  4  5  14  3  4  2  5  6  7  2  5  1  4  5  15  3  4  1  5  5  8  3  1  2  8 maintained at every participating node.

Throughput is a concern because consensus algorithms like PoW or PBFT take time to verify a transaction. We created 15 different configurations of nodes and test the throughput of immigration records and courier tracking implementations on each configuration. The results are tabulated in Table 1 and plotted in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5. Table 1 and the performance graphs, it can be concluded that the network throughput is mainly influenced by the ordering nodes and by choice of consensus algorithm involved. The performance of public blockchains we created is not observed because the pilot applications were deployed on Rinkeby public blockchain network, and the typical network latency for Rinkeby is 15-30 s.",

The solutions that are proposed are all based on using Blockchain as an underlying platform to perform transactions, thus providing security and transparency to counteract against encroachments of all forms, be in lands, drugs, insurance claims, courier delivery, or the most deadly of all COVID-19. The authors presented the performance observed after the implementation of the said applications and noticed that the throughput is a significant concern in blockchain implementations. In the case of private blockchains, the number of validating nodes (ordering nodes) plays an important part in deciding the performance of the network. In this testing period, when the entire world is severely affected by the coronavirus, the suggested use case of the ",
