As described by Stensland et al [1] , urology services have been reduced significantly, with manpower and resources redeployed and reallocated to frontline departments, focusing attention to urgent-only cases during the COVID-19 pandemic [2] . In this letter, we add to the considerations provided by Stensland et al by highlighting important patient safety strategies and safeguards used at a tertiary urological centre amid the climate of resource scarcity during this pandemic. Patient safety is defined as \"the avoidance, prevention, and amelioration of adverse outcomes or injuries stemming from the processes of healthcare\" [3] . Our three-pronged strategy includes: maintaining a strong safety culture, maintaining core services, and mitigating the risk of transmission for vulnerable patient groups.",
