Bovine coronavirus causes acute diarrhea in neonatal calves and winter dysentery in adult cattle causing large economic losses owing to diarrheal morbidity and mortality costs and decreased milk production (2,27\u201331). The enteropathogenic coronaviruses were initially identified and isolated from neonatal calves with severe diarrhea (31). Subsequently, coronaviruses were revealed to be a cause of winter dysentery in adult cattle (2,32\u201335) as well as respiratory disease (shipping fever pneumonia) (29,36\u201340), and antigenic, biologic, and genetic variation among these strains was demonstrated (28,37,41\u201343). Repeated upper respiratory BCoV infections occur frequently in calves, and subclinically infected animals may be reservoirs for BCoV (28,30).",

A pancorona-specific primer pair modified from Ksiazek et al. (4), targeted to the conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is capable of universal detection of known coronaviruses (see\nNote 8). Group 2a-specific primers were designed based on the consensus sequence of the nucleoprotein gene for group 2a coronaviruses (see\nNote 9). The BCoV-specific primers are targeted to the nucleoprotein and can also amplify a specific fragment for BCoV and the related wild-ruminant CoVs, but not other group 2 coronaviruses (28).Reaction conditions are optimized using RT-PCR reagents commercially available from Promega, but they are easily adapted to enable the use of alternative reagents.The typical PCR master mix should contain the following reagents in the 0.2-ml PCR tubes (RNAse/DNAse and Pyrogene safe): 10X thermophillic DNA polymerase buffer (2.5 \u03bcl); magnesium chloride 2.5 mM; 0.2 M dNTPs mix; forward and reverse primers 50 pmol each; AMV reverse transcriptase 2.5 U; RNasin 10 U; Taq DNA polymerase 1.25 U; adjust volume with Milli-Q DEPC-treated water to 23 \u03bcl. 2-\u03bcl RNAs extracted from the samples is added to each tube. RNA extracted from mock-inoculated HRT-18 cell culture supernatants or negative fecal or nasal samples and water should be used as negative controls and BCoV-infected HRT-18 cell culture supernatants or BCoV-positive fecal or nasal samples as positive controls.The following RT-PCR cycles should be used: 42\u00b0C for 60 min, 94\u00b0C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 0.5 min, 50\u00b0C/56\u00b0C (see\nNote 10) for 0.5 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 7 min, and hold at 4\u00b0C.\n",

            "text": "In summary, multiple diagnostic tests have been developed and standardized for the routine diagnosis of BCoV and the closely related ruminant Group 2a CoVs. These include antigen or antibody detection by ELISA, virus isolation in cell culture (HRT-18 cells), and, often the most sensitive method, detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. These methods have provided evidence for the presence of CoVs closely related genetically or antigenically to BCoV, not only from wild ruminants, but also from dogs (21) and humans (53). These findings and experimental transmission studies (8,44,54) confirm a broad host range for bovine-like group 2a CoVs and support a need to monitor their presence in other host species, including humans, by applying the diagnostic assays outlined in this chapter and the sequencing of new isolates.",

            "text": "\nFBS used for the cell cultures should be inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and should be validated as bovine viral diarrhea virus-free.After absorption of samples (1 h), washing the cells with Dil. #5 can help to avoid cytotoxic effects.The positive control sample is from supernatant of HRT-18 cell cultures inoculated with BCoV Mebus strain and the negative control sample is from supernatants of mock-inoculated HRT-18 cell cultures. Alternatively, diluted feces from a BCoV- or mock-inoculated gnotobiotic calf can be used as positive and negative controls, respectively (28,37,44).Positive control serum sample is hyperimmune serum from a gnotobiotic calf inoculated with BCoV-440 and negative control serum sample is serum from a mock-inoculated gnotobiotic calf (28,37,44).All solutions should be prepared in water that has a resistivity of 18 M\u03a9-cm, unless stated otherwise.Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) is a carcinogen, so a fume hood should be used when working with this reagent.Some fecal samples from conventional animals can contain PCR inhibitors, especially if they were frozen. If such a problem occurs, dilution of extracted RNA (1:10\u20131:20) can be helpful; if inhibitors persist, commercial kits (Epicentre, QIAGEN) optimized for DNA extraction from fecal samples should be used.The conserved region of the RdRp was initially chosen as a target to allow universal detection of all CoVs. The original universal primer pair targeted to this region from Ksiazek et al. (4) was not optimal in RT-PCR with some CoV samples from wild ruminants. Thus, based on the consensus sequence (for all available RdRp sequences of coronaviruses from different groups) in all polymorphic positions, degenerative nucleotides were introduced. After these primers were tested with positive samples (validated in other assays), they demonstrated consistently positive results.The coronavirus nucleoprotein gene was chosen for group-specific primer development because it has been shown to be variable in amino acid and nucleotide composition among the viruses that comprise the three coronavirus antigenic groups, but highly conserved within these groups.The optimal melting temperature for group 2a- specific primers and nested-PCR is 56\u00b0C; for pancorona- and BCoV-specific primers, the optimal melting temperature is 50\u00b0C.If RT-PCR sensitivity is low, a nested PCR method can increase PCR product yield. However, this will also increase the risk of cross-contamination. Standard precautions to avoid cross-contamination should be implemented. These include: use of gloves with frequent changing; employing of aerosol resistant pipettors and pipette tips; preparing of PCR master mixes in UV cabinets that should never be used for work with any sample materials or PCR DNA products; regular decontamination of work surfaces and all equipment with 10% chlorine or another commercially available disinfectant; separate working areas for each step of the PCR analysis as well as separate storage areas for PCR reagents and contaminated samples (47).\n",
