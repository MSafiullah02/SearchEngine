In addition, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) were started to manage the potential of bacterial pneumonia. For ICU patients, the same patient management policy was followed, but the choice of antibiotics was broader, such as piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) with or without vancomycin (Vancocin). All 36 patients were discharged from the hospital after the following: 1) complete recovery from their current illness, 2) complete resolution of respiratory symptoms and oxygen dependency, 3) improved radiological parameters based upon serial radiographs and 4) improved laboratory parameters. All these patients fulfilled above mentioned criterion before discharge from the hospital.",
