            "text": "Influenza is an infectious viral disease of the respiratory system, caused by influenza viruses belonging to Orthomyxoviridae. There are three types of the influenza virus: A, B and C, among which infections caused by type C are asymptomatic. In every epidemic season, infections are induced by influenza virus type A and B, with usually a different course of illness for either type of virus, which also depends on the patient\u2019s age and the immune system\u2019s efficiency (Brydak 2008). Influenza A virus is divided into subtypes, depending on the combination of the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 types of HA and 11 types of NA described (Wu et al. 2014). Improperly treated infections caused by influenza viruses can lead to complications and consequently to death. Therefore, it is important to confirm the presence of influenza virus in a short period of time, using molecular biology methods (Bednarska et al. 2016b), which enables to apply antiviral drugs, i.e., neuraminidase inhibitors, soon after onset of symptoms (Fiore et al. 2011; Brydak 2008).",

There were 15,312 hospitalizations and 140 deaths due to complications of influenza, including 135 deaths among people over 14 years of age. The peak incidence of ILI occurred in week 8 of 2016. During the season more than 8500 samples were tested and more than 5000 of them were collected from people aged over 14. The distribution of confirmed cases of influenza viruses by age and the viral type are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The highest percentage of confirmations was observed in the persons aged 45\u201364 (13.1% of cases), less in those aged 26\u201344 (12.6%) and over 65 (9.9% of cases), while in the group of 15\u201325 years of age viruses were confirmed in 4.6% of cases. The dominant type was influenza A virus, subtype A/H1N1/pdm09. The highest number of confirmed cases of this subtype was reported in the persons aged 45\u201364 (n = 489), while in those aged 26\u201344 and over 65 the numbers of confirmed cases were comparable: 350 and 336, respectively. In the persons aged 15\u201325, subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 was confirmed in 66 cases. The subtype A/H1N1/ was detected in individual cases in all age-groups, with more than 10 cases present only in the persons aged over 65 (Fig. 1). Concerning the unsubtyped influenza virus type A, the number of confirmed cases was similar in all age-groups investigated, amounting to 64 cases in the persons aged 15\u201325, 67 cases in those aged 26\u201344, 70 cases in those aged 45\u201364, and 52 cases in those aged over 65.

There also was a difference in the most frequent contagion between the two seasons, with subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 (62.6%) predominating in 2015/2016 as opposed to A/H3N2/ predominating the season before in persons over 14 years of age (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2016). The present study demonstrates that subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 predominated in all age groups, except for 15\u201324 years old persons in whom virus type B was dominant (Fig. 2). In both compared seasons, the highest incidence of influenza was reported in the age-groups of 45\u201364 and 26\u201344 years and the lowest one in the 15\u201324 years old persons (Fig. 1) (Bednarska et al. 2016b). Interestingly, the number of confirmed cases of influenza virus was the highest in the same age-groups of 45\u201364 and 26\u201344 years in the past 2013/2014 season (Bednarska et al. 2015). We also found that the activity of RSV and PIV-3 was increased in 2015/2016 compared with that in the season before (NIPH-NIH 2015/2016).",

A particular attention should be paid to the A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09 strain which was a vaccine component since the 2010/2011 season, and also caused most influenza cases in persons over 14 years of age in the currently evaluated season. Given that the percentage of vaccinated population in this age range in Poland ranks at a dismally low level and has a decreasing trend from 1.95% in 2011 to 1.37% in 2015 (Epimeld 2016), it can be judged that that the recorded number of influenza cases reflects the immunodeficiency to this viral strain (Brydak 2015).",

That result points to substantial improvements in infection surveillance and imbued nuances in the virological and epidemiological procedures despite a drastically low and inexplicably decreasing percentage of adult, mostly middle-aged, population getting vaccinated against influenza each epidemic season in Poland. The virological data presented in this article seek to call repeat attention to the need to vaccinate against influenza as the most effective method of preventing the infection and its severe complications, death included; a need advocated by the WHO, major medical societies, and 142 National Influenza Centers worldwide.",
