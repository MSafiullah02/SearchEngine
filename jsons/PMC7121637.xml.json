Science and technology-related factors are concerned with R&D personnel qualification, know-how sourcing and regional infrastructure. These factors are largely outside the direct influence of R&D but necessary for its fundamental operations, such as the proximity to universities or the R&D environment. Proximity to markets and customers, improvements of image and collaborations are notable sales & output efficiency-related factors. Efficiency-related criteria focus on the costs of running and the critical mass of R&D units, as well as efficient hand-over processes between R&D and other corporate functions. Direct cost advantages (such as the often-publicized labor costs) rarely influence the internationalization of R&D in the long run, but other efficiency-oriented factors such as costs of coordination and transfer, and critical laboratory size do have an even bigger impact on international R&D organization. Direct costs may become more important in the coming years as the other factors improve in low labor cost countries.\n",

Even though small size is a driver for internationalization, the global marketing reach of large firms facilitates the leverage of global R&D and innovation. For instance, when Pfizer acquired Wyeth and Merck acquired Schering-Plough in 2009, on paper the two merged firms would have accounted for 51% of the total U.S. pharmaceutical R&D spending and 39% of total world-wide spending (Comanor and Scherer 2013). Subsequent cost reduction programs eliminated R&D units in the combined companies, but since both domestic and foreign units were closed down, this had little effect on their new extent of R&D internationalization. Rather, we observed a centralization of R&D in certain internationally leading regions of innovation ( centers of excellence). However, mergers are rarely driven by scientific or technological reasons. Access to new markets and economies-of-scale effects are primary drivers for mergers. Nevertheless, the resulting R&D conglomerate must somehow come to terms with a new and more international organization.",

Host country restrictions, such as local content requirements, tolls, import quota, and fulfillment of standards, can attract R&D into key market countries (pull regulations): Both the U.S. and China have plenty of such regulations attracting inbound R&D investments from overseas. On the other hand, home country restrictions may induce companies to move R&D abroad (push regulations): European regulations caused biotechnology R&D to be transferred to the U.S., and lack of homegrown talent forced Swiss pharma companies to set up R&D centers abroad.",

China has seen a particularly strong increase of inbound R&D investments in recent years, but domestic companies are also conducting more and more R&D. Compared to China and India, the other frequently mentioned BRIC countries\u2014Brazil, Russia, and sometimes also South Africa\u2014are far behind. They lack economic and institutional attractiveness, and their domestic high-tech ecosystem is still underdeveloped, comparatively speaking.\nOver 70% of all research sites are in the five regions of the Northeastern USA (New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts), California, the United Kingdom, Western Continental Europe (in particular Germany), and the Far East (Japan, South Korea). China (especially Shanghai and Beijing) and India (especially Mumbai and Bangalore) are catching up as locations for research, too. The trend of research concentration is even more apparent when only foreign research locations are considered: almost 90% are in the triad regions of the U.S., Europe, and Japan.Although the main regional centers for development largely coincide with the regional centers for research, development is more evenly distributed among European countries and the Northeastern United States, and extends into Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa, and South America. Only slightly more than half of all development sites are located in the eight most development-intensive countries.\n",

Transnational R&D projects are managed more easily if the R&D network consists of competence centers (pharmaceutical firms tend to be ahead in reorganizing themselves around competence centers) , given that complementary competencies are provided locally.

Pharmaceutical companies also seem to internationalize research as fast as development (albeit for different reasons). Most other industries tend to keep research at home and localize development. Although not obvious from location data alone, pharmaceutical companies also tend to organize R&D as competence-based networks, as opposed to R&D hubs (e.g., automotive and chemicals), polycentric networks (e.g., local market-dependent companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell) or centralized R&D (e.g., dominant design industries). In competence-based R&D networks, each R&D node has a clearly defined competence\u2014and responsibility!\u2014which it brings into the network of other R&D centers. The coordination and management of such R&D networks is more demanding and costly than rather centralized and directive R&D hubs, or the laissez-faire style of polycentric R&D networks. As a consequence, pharmaceutical companies (and many electrical and IT companies, who also favor this type of R&D organization) try to coordinate R&D activities across multiple levels, including the deployment of transnational project teams, platform management, informal as well as formal network techniques.",

Webber (2005) put their number at approximately 6800 Chinese pharmaceutical companies, of which 5000 produced medicines (small-molecule generics and biotech products, i.e. not including herbal medicines or traditional Chinese medicines) and the remainder were involved in pharmaceutical-related activities such as packaging and equipment supply. A large share of them are merely producers of raw materials (Wang and von Zedtwitz 2005). By 2015, this market was still highly fragmented, with 5000 domestic companies in operation, of which the top 100 accounting for only one third of the total market (ITA 2016).

For instance, Roche had an R&D office in Shanghai long before it opened a dedicated R&D center in 2004. It was not until the mid-2000s that global pharma companies discovered Chinas as a harbor for strategic R&D operations, perhaps a decade after global electronics, IT and automotive firms started to invest in R&D in China. There are several reasons for this relative late arrival in China:Uncertain IP protection: China had reintroduced patent law only as recently as 1985, and neither the general public nor the scientific ecosystem was used to developing, protecting, and honoring intellectual property. The courts, the legal system, and the police had little\u2014if any\u2014experience in dealing with IP cases. Chinese employees had little sensitivity for personal safety or safety as a public good. Tacit knowledge and knowledge that was pre-patent was not easy to secure and appropriate. Of course, these conditions affected also other industries, but in pharma\u2014with its extremely long lead times\u2014such unwanted exposure of technical knowledge is very harmful.Fragmented nature and complexity of China\u2019s market: 3700 domestic companies accounted for 75% of annual sales, of which 95% operated in the low value generics market (Dierks et al. 2013). Most needs are met by local generics, with only between 6% and 7% being patent-protected innovative drugs.Price pressure: 40% of China\u2019s healthcare budget was being spent on medicine compared with 10\u201312% in Western countries, leading to considerable political pressure to reduce prices (KnowledgeWharton 2013).\n",

One famous example is Lipitor, a statin first discovered in natural sources with sales exceeding US$10 billion annually.Access and research on TCM: China-based innovations include Artemisinin, invented in China using sweet wormwood and hailed as a miracle malaria drug, Sobuzoxan, an anti-tumor drug, and Huperzine A (HupA), a novel alkaloid isolated from a Chinese medicinal herb, which improves memory deficiencies in Alzheimer patients.\n",

Western policymakers and governmental institutions have therefore launched several initiatives at making the reverse transfer of emerging market solutions (from so-called LIC low-income countries) more predictable and more systematic:Prize competitions: Snowdon et al. (2015) reported the results of an open competition for healthcare solutions from developing or emerging countries, with the winner to be awarded US$50,000 for further financing their project. A committee evaluated all 12 submitted projects on the basis of seven weighted criteria. Apart from the winning innovation being supported through the prize money, the competing entries also benefited from project-specific feedback, and through media exposure the public was made aware of the potential of reverse innovation in health care.Crossover identifications: DePasse and Lee (2013) described a four-step model to transfer reverse innovations that includes a common problem identification in a LIC, a dissemination analysis in that country, a crossover proposal, and subsequent dissemination in a high-income country (HIC). The trick is not only to execute that crossover effectively, but also to identify suitable reverse innovation candidates and to support disseminiation in the home country.Scoring assessments: Battacharaya et al. (2017) developed a two-step scoring system with eight assessment criteria, mostly for use by policymakers, public institutions or funding agencies. The purpose of this assessment is to identify potential reverse innovations and qualify them for their suitability to be transferred and applicability to an unmet need in the home country.\n",
