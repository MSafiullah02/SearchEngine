            "text": "Annual influenza epidemics cause approximately 290,000\u2013650,000 deaths in addition to causing severe illness in 3\u20135 million individuals each year (WHO 2018). This threat poses a continuous challenge to the health care and public health system and is an economic burden to individuals and countries. The 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu, which was caused by the most virulent influenza virus to date, infected about 5% of the world\u2019s population and had a mortality rate of 2% (Taubenberger and Morens 2006). In recent years, some of the most prevalent highly-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (such as H5N1 and H7N9) have crossed the species barrier, resulting in human infection and death (Liu et al.2013). Although the pathogenesis of influenza is not fully understood, severe cytokine storm, with markedly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferons (IFNs), tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), interleukins (ILs), and chemokines, has been detected in patients hospitalized with severe influenza infections (Beigel et al.2005). This aggressive pro-inflammatory response along with an insufficient anti-inflammatory response is commonly referred to as the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (Liu et al. 2016). Several studies have shown that cytokine storms are directly associated with influenza-induced fatal acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Tisoncik et al.2012; Short et al.2014). Antiviral treatments, which target viral components, are prone to develop drug-resistant viruses and have a narrow time window for their administration; they are also unable to control the excessive pro-inflammatory response that occurs in the late stage of infection (Davidson 2018). Therefore, the attenuation of the host inflammatory response with immunomodulators may represent a good strategy for combating severe influenza. In addition, therapeutics designed to target host components are less likely to develop drug-resistant virus strains. In recent years, a few immunomodulatory agents, including proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) antagonist (Khoufache et al.2013), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1) receptor 1 agonists (Teijaro et al.2011), and tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) inhibitors (Florence et al.2018), have shown protective effects in animal models including alleviating the pulmonary inflammatory reaction and increasing survival rates. However, the lack of efficient cell-based screening models is a great impediment in the development of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting influenza-induced cytokine storms (Davidson 2018). Animal models, despite being ideal for studying potential anti-inflammatory therapeutics, are very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish fast, economical and time-saving screening methods using cell-based models that can be used to screen and develop more potent immunomodulatory agents.",

            "text": "Upon infection of host cells by an influenza virus, they can be subsequently recognized by pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR3/7 and RIG-I, which activate downstream pathways, including the NF-\u03baB pathway and the IRF pathways, leading to the expression of multiple cytokines (Pulendran and Maddur 2015). Among the influenza-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, some common and important pro-inflammatory factors including IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8, have been detected in patients with severe influenza (Ramos and Fernandez-Sesma 2015). Based on their roles in influenza mediated inflammatory injuries in the lungs, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 are co-regulated by the NF-\u03baB pathway, and the interferons are regulated by the IRF pathways, which can induce the expression of a panel of ISGs, e.g., CXCL9 and CXCL10, primarily through the STAT pathways and the NF-\u03baB pathway (Iwasaki and Pillai 2014). Although the functions of these cytokines have not been fully elucidated, they can be further categorized into two classes according to their therapeutic effects in animal experiments when being targeted: class one includes factors that do not improve or worsen the disease after gene knockout or antibody neutralization, e.g., CCL5 (Wareing et al.2004), IFN-\u03b2 (Mordstein et al.2008), and IL-1\u03b2 (Kozak et al.1995); class two includes factors that, along with gene knockout or antibody neutralization, can significantly increase the rate of survival and reduce inflammation in the lungs, e.g. CCL2 (Damjanovic et al.2011; Hrincius et al.2015), and CXCL10 (Ichikawa et al.2013; Wang et al.2013). Therefore, the second class of factors appears to be ideal therapeutic targets for influenza-induced inflammation.",

First, seven human cell lines that are reported to be involved in influenza-induced inflammation were screened to identify an appropriate cell line that can support influenza virus infection and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using the protein levels of the two important chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10 as readouts, the human monocytic cell line U937 was identified as a suitable cell line and selected to establish a cell-based model. The U937 cell model was validated by testing a panel of agents with reported anti-inflammatory or antiviral activities in vivo and a drug library comprised of 1280 compounds, most of which are FDA-approved drugs. Our results indicate that the human U937 cell line can be used as a model to study the influenza-induced cytokine release and in high-throughput screening of drugs that target components of the influenza-induced cytokine storm.",

MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), and the other cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. Both the DMEM and RPMI 1640 medium were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibico) and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin. The differentiation of U937 and THP-1 cells into cells possessing a macrophage-like phenotype was achieved by induction with 100 ng/mL of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h (Garcia et al.1999; Genin et al.2015). To induce HL-60 cells to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells, HL-60 cells were cultured in growth media (RPMI1640 + 10% FBS) supplemented with 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 5 days, as described previously (Millius and Weiner 2009).

In order to identify a human cell line that can support influenza virus infection and the production of important pro-inflammatory cytokines, while also being suitable for screening anti-influenza drugs suppressing cytokine release, we examined seven human cell lines, including the epithelial lung A549 cells, promyelocytic HL-60 cells, neutrophil-like iHL-60 cells, monocytic TPH-1 cells, macrophage-like iTPH-1 cells, monocytic U937 cells, and macrophage-like iU937 cells, for their abilities in supporting influenza virus infection and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines based on signal-to-background ratios (SBRs) during virus replication and CCL2/CXCL10/IL-8/IL-6 expression levels (Table 1). Among the cell lines tested, A549 has lower SBRs in viral replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion when infected with H1N1 PR8 influenza virus at MOI of 0.1 and cultured for 48 h, while HL-60 and iHL-60 can support influenza virus replication under the same conditions, but they only induce specific cytokine expression (CCL2 for HL-60, IL-6 for iHL-60). Therefore, these cell lines are not suitable for developing cell models for screening of anti-influenza drugs suppressing cytokine release. The human monocytic U937 cell line was found to support efficient replication of influenza virus H1N1 PR8 strain and the production of the four pro-inflammatory cytokines tested; additionally, it also had the highest SBRs for both viral replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Interestingly, THP-1 cell line, which is also monocytic cell, was shown to support influenza virus replication; however, it only expressed two of the four pro-inflammatory cytokines with very low expression levels under the same conditions. It is worth noting that the U937 and THP-1 cells were less supportive of influenza virus infection after being induced into macrophage-like cells and the SBRs of viral replication decreased from 7.3 and 5.8 to 2.4 and 1.5, respectively. Although the total expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in iU937 and iTHP-1 were significantly increased (data not shown), the amount of cytokine expression in the uninfected group was also greatly increased, which resulted in the lower SBRs of the three pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results indicate that the un-induced monocyte cell line U937 has the greatest potential to be a cell model for screening anti-inflammatory agents among the seven cell types tested.",

Viral replication levels were determined according to neuraminidase (NA) levels and viral titers in a time course assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, NA activities in the supernatants increased with increasing MOIs of the viruses and reached a peak level at 48 hpi (hours post infection). Interestingly, both the culture time and the MOI can affect the viral titers of the supernatants of infected U937 cells (Fig. 1B). We found that the viral growth curves in U937 cells determined by the TCID50 endpoint dilution assay were consistent with what was determined using the NA activities when the MOIs were equal to or less than 0.1, suggesting that under such infection MOI conditions, the NA activities correlate well with the influenza virus titers. The TCID50 growth curves at high MOIs are partially inconsistent with the NA growth curves, in that the TCID50s reached peak levels at 24 hpi, possibly due to the cell death caused by virus-induced cytopathic effects with longer culture times (Fig. 1A\u20131C). Next, we tested the mRNA levels of the seven major pro-inflammatory cytokines induced post-infection in the influenza-infected U937 cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, at 12 hpi, the mRNA levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in U937 cells increased by 26.3, 1.7, 318.3, 27.5, 7.5, 344.2 and 2.15 times, respectively, indicating that PR8 infection can stimulate the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines in U937 cells. To study the correlation between the production of cytokines and virus MOIs, we then measured the protein levels of CCL2 and CXCL10 in the supernatants of the PR8 virus infected U937 cells. As shown in Fig. 1E and 1F, there was no apparent production of cytokines observed at 12 hpi, and the protein levels of CCL2 and CXCL10 were found to be at low levels at 24 hpi, reaching their highest levels at 48 hpi. It is worth noting that the levels of both CCL2 and CXCL10 increased with decreasing MOIs and reached their highest levels when the MOIs were around 0.025\u20130.05. However, as the MOI decreased below that range, i.e. 0.0125, the productions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL2 and CXCL10 were observed to greatly decrease. These results indicate that U937 cells can support the replication of the influenza virus PR8 as well as the production of multiple cytokines. More importantly, infection of U937 cells with a relatively low MOI is critical for the production of the influenza-induced cytokine storm; infection with a high MOI can cause severe CPE and a low MOI can result in a low level of viral replication, both conditions can attenuate influenza-induced cytokine expression.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are classified into types A, B, C and D and make up four of the seven genera of orthomyxoviridae. The type A viruses are the most virulent pathogens and can also be subdivided into different serotypes based on the antibody response to the viral components HA and NA. Influenza B viruses almost exclusively infect humans and can cause severe disease; they have only one serotype. Each of these influenza viruses may replicate and induce a cytokine storm in host cells differently (Hay et al.2001). To investigate whether U937 cells can support the replication of different subtypes of influenza viruses and as well as the expression of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines in addition to the IAV H1N1 strain we initially used, three other subtypes of influenza virus strains from type A and one strain from type B, including H3N2, H7N8, and IBV, were selected and used to infect U937 cells. All four virus strains were able to replicate in U937 cells, although IBV was shown to replicate much less efficiently, as shown in Fig. 2A. Next, we examined the expression of CCL2, CXCL10, and IL-8 in the supernatants of the infected U937 cells. H1N1, H3N2, and H7N8 virus strains were shown to induce the expression of CCL2, CXCL10, and IL-8 (Fig. 2B\u20132D). Interestingly, IBV, which was shown to replicate inefficiently in U937 cells, activates the expression of the three cytokines as efficiently as the other three IAV strains (Fig. 2). These results indicate that U937 cells can support the replication of different types and subtypes of influenza viruses and induce the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to these virus infections. In addition, the infection of a relatively low MOI of influenza virus in U937 cells is critical and sufficient for the production of multiple cytokines.",

As expected, most of these immunomodulatory agents, with the exception of rosiglitazone, showed anti-inflammatory activities in the U937 cell model, as determined by their inhibition of CCL2 and CXCL10 expression. The antiviral agents, including the macrolide antibiotic ascomycin and the antiviral drugs ribavirin and Oseltamivir, were shown to have antiviral effects in the U937 cell model, as determined by the neuraminidase activity assay (Table 2). In contrast, some of the anti-inflammatory agents, including the COX non-selective inhibitor ibuprofen and the COX2-specific inhibitor etoricoxib, which have been reported to have no improvement on the survival rate of influenza-infected mice when used alone, were shown to have no inhibitory effect on the production of CCL2 and CXCL10 in U937 cell model (Table 2). Though the diversity and numbers of agents tested here were limited, these results suggest that, when using NA as an antiviral readout and CCL2/CXCL10 expression as anti-inflammatory readouts, the U937 cell model can be used to screen antiviral and immunomodulatory agents against influenza infection.",

Viral replication and the expression levels of cytokines were determined using a neuraminidase assay and AlphaLISA, respectively. The performance of our U937 cell-based HTS platform was evaluated by screening the FDA-drug library to identify agents that can inhibit the induction of the expression of CCL2 and CXCL10 by influenza infection (Fig. 3A). At a concentration of 20 \u03bcmol/L, 1280 compounds were screened on four 384-well plates. The SBRs of NA in the four plates were between 7.5 and 15, as shown in Fig. 3B. The SBRs of CCL2 and CXCL10 were between 17.6 and 21.5, and 20.8 and 28.3, respectively. The average Z\u2032 factor for NA, CCL2, and CXCL10 were 0.74, 0.75 and 0.84, respectively; all of the Z\u2032 factors were greater than 0.65, suggesting that the U937 cell model is robust and desirable for the HTS of immunomodulatory agents against the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by influenza virus infection.",

Interestingly, when analyzing the composition of the hit compounds with anti-CCL2 and anti-CXCL10 effects, listed in Supplementary Table S1, we found that most of the traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, such as steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cox inhibitors, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, histamine antagonist, 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, and cholinergic receptor inhibitor, were identified as hits with anti-CCL2 effects, but not as hits with anti-CXCL10 effects. In addition to traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, many agents with new targets were identified as well, which include the majority of the 16 hits found in both the anti-CCL2 and anti-CXCL10 hits, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase IV inhibitors, ion channel inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

To further confirm and evaluate their efficacies in repressing cytokine expression, we tested all 16 hit compounds for their kinetic inhibition of CCL2 and CXCL10 and cell viabilities in U937 cells. Their IC50s and CC50s were determined. Compounds with an IC50 > 10 \u03bcmol/L or shown to have no effect were considered to be inactive, 10 out of 16 hit compounds met this criterion (data not shown). Compounds with an IC50 < or = 10 \u03bcmol/L were considered to be active; 6 out of the 16 primary hit compounds met this criterion, they are dasatinib, pitavastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, protriptyline, and levofloxacin (Fig. 4A\u20134F). The cytotoxicity of the six hit compounds on uninfected U937 cells was determined, as shown in Fig. 4 (right panel). The CC50s were all greater than 90 \u00b5mol/L, except for simvastatin which had a CC50 of 66.8 \u03bcmol/L. To exclude compounds with antiviral activities that may lead to a reduction in CCL2 and CXCL10 levels, we examined the antiviral effects of the six hit compounds in the same confirmation experiments simultaneously (Fig. 4 right panels). Surprisingly, all 6 of the hits were shown to promote viral amplification to varying degrees, and viral replication was shown to increase with increasing drug concentrations, suggesting that these compounds may also inhibit the expression or functions of certain host factors associated with the innate antiviral response that correlated to the influenza-induced cytokine storm. Based on the kinetic inhibition of the two important cytokines CCL2 and CXCL10, and the IC50s and SIs (Fig. 4 and Table 3), we identified 6 compounds with potent inhibitory effects on influenza-induced expression of cytokines in U937 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the U937 cell model is suitable for high throughput screening of anti-inflammatory drugs against influenza-induced cytokine release.",

            "text": "Due to the narrow therapeutic window for the administration of anti-flu drugs, typically within 2 days of the onset of symptoms, and the association of excessive inflammatory responses with severe influenza pneumonia, the treatment of influenza pneumonia cannot rely solely on antiviral drugs. Combination therapies that include both antiviral agents and anti-inflammatory agents represent a potential solution in curing influenza pneumonia. Immunomodulators that can inhibit the excessive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients infected by influenza viruses are urgently needed. However, the use of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids, during an influenza infection has been found to have either no effect or even detrimental effects in clinical retrospective studies (Hui and Lee 2013; Ramos and Fernandez-Sesma 2015). Therefore, the use of selective immunomodulatory agents to specifically inhibit the excessive expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in influenza pneumonia is a potentially valid strategy. However, currently, it is rare to find influenza-related anti-inflammatory drugs either in clinical trials or in preclinical research. Several animal models for influenza infection, including mouse, ferret, and guinea pig models, are suitable for the evaluation of potential anti-inflammatory drugs, however, they are not suitable for HTS screening of compound libraries comprised of synthetic small molecules or natural products. There are a few existing influenza infection cell models suitable for high-throughput antiviral drug screening, those include kidney cell models (MDBK or MDCK) (Gerritz et al.2011; An et al.2014), human epithelial cell model (A549) (Hoffmann et al.2008). However, the current cell models are not suitable for screening of immunomodulating agents for influenza treatment. Therefore, the establishment of a cell-based influenza virus infection model that can be used for both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug discovery is very valuable and urgently needed.",

To establish a useful cell model, the right cell type must be chosen; one that plays an important role in influenza-induced cytokine storms and has the appropriate readouts (e.g. induces the expression of the most important cytokines upon influenza infection). Lung epithelial cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages all play important roles in the influenza-induced cytokine storm and the subsequent ALI and ARDS (Short et al.2014). In order to identify a human cell line that can support multi-types and -subtypes of influenza virus infection and the production of important pro-inflammatory cytokines, we examined seven human cell lines, including epithelial cell, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages, that are important for the pathogenesis of severe influenza and found that monocytic U937 cells can support the infection and replication of the three IAV and one IBV strains tested. Next, we measured the expression of 7 cytokines, including CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, by quantifying their mRNA levels. A strong response was observed for five of the seven cytokines. For the purpose of using U937 cells as a model for the influenza-induced cytokine production, we measured the correlation between the kinetic expression of CCL2 and CXCL10 at different time points and the MOIs of the viruses used for infection and found that the expression of CCL2 and CXCL10 reached their peak levels when the U937 cells were infected with an influenza virus at an MOI between 0.025 and 0.05. Furthermore, the U937 cell model was demonstrated to support complete viral replication and the expression of CCL2, CXCL10, and IL8 when infected by all of the four subtypes of influenza viruses tested. Therefore, the U937 cell model exhibits great potential for drug discovery of anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents against influenza. However, we think other human cell lines of epithelial, neutrophil, monocyte, and macrophage origins may also be useful for the study of influenza mediated cytokine responses; however, their applications are not as robust for HTS as the U937 cell line and need to be carefully tested and optimized.",

In the fatal cases caused by an influenza virus infection, the levels of these two cytokines were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls (de Jong et al.2006; Deng et al.2008; To et al.2010; Gao et al.2013). (2) Functional studies have shown that knocking out the CCL2 or CXCL10 genes or using neutralizing antibodies to deplete their protein levels and subsequently reducing their functional activity, can significantly alleviate the inflammatory response to influenza infection and improve the survival rate in experimental animal models of influenza infection (Damjanovic et al.2011; Ichikawa et al.2013; Wang et al.2013; Hrincius et al.2015). (3) CCL2 and CXCL10 are two of the major cytokines/chemokines that recruit monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, both of which play important roles in influenza-induced inflammation (Ichikawa et al.2013; Tavares et al.2017). The reduction of the levels of these two cytokines may decrease the infiltration of inflammatory cells. (4) CCL2 and CXCL10 are regulated by different signaling pathways. CCL2 is primarily regulated by the NF-\u03baB pathway whereas CXCL10 is predominantly regulated by the interferon pathway, both of which are key pathways for controlling inflammatory cytokine responses (Chen et al.2018). (5) Although the inclusion of more cytokines and chemokines may be a better representation of the influenza-induced cytokine storm, too many readouts may unnecessarily complicate the screen. Based on these reasons and concerns, we decided to start with two of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines, CCL2 and CXCL10.",

Almost all of the immunomodulatory and antiviral agents with known activities in vivo (Table 2) showed expected anti-cytokine and antiviral effects. The screen of the FDA- drug library led to the identification of 16 hit compounds that were shown to inhibit the production of both cytokines, and many hits were shown to inhibit either CCL2 or CXCL10. The average Z\u2032 factor for NA, CCL2, and CXCL10 were 0.74, 0.75 and 0.84, respectively, suggesting that the U937 cell model is robust and desirable for HTS of immunomodulatory agents against influenza infection. Interestingly, most of the traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, i.e. steroidal and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, are identified as CCL2 inhibitors. Many novel immunomodulatory agents with new targets were identified in both the anti-CCL2 and anti-CXCL10 hits, covering diverse host targets, including histamine receptors, 5-HT2 receptors, \u03b2-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase, ion channels, and tyrosine kinases. It appears that the target distribution of CCL2 and CXCL10 inhibitors are different but related to some extent, suggesting that the expression of CCL2 and CXCL10 are co-regulated by certain signaling pathways, and specifically regulated by their own signaling pathways.",

It is worth noting that the 6 re-confirmed hit compounds can be categorized into four classes: (A) TPK inhibitors, (B) Quinolone antibiotics, (C) Statins, and (D) Serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Interestingly, inhibitors targeting these four classes of targets have been previously reported in the literature to reduce inflammation and improve lung pathology caused by influenza infection. The TPK inhibitors, ibrutinib, and imatinib have been reported to protect mice from lethal influenza infection and improve acute lung injury caused by influenza (Hrincius et al.2015; Florence et al.2018). The quinolone antibiotic levofloxacin, which has antioxidant effects, increased the survival rate in mice infected with the H1N1 PR8 virus and was shown to inhibit excessive superoxide production in the lungs of mice (Enoki et al.2015). Statins block the inflammatory signaling pathway and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory factors in cells. Their use in animal experiments has shown to reduce the mortality of H1N1 and H3N2-infected mice. More importantly, in the retrospective study of human drug use, the use of statins is associated with a reduction in influenza-induced lethality (Liu et al.2009; Mehrbod et al.2014; Davidson 2018). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors can alleviate lung inflammation in mice induced by the H1N1 influenza virus and reduce mortality in mice (Sharma et al.2013). These results indicate that using CCL2 and CXCL10 as readouts in the U937 cell-based model for anti-inflammatory drug screening have predictive value for in vivo efficacy. Of note, many hits that inhibit only CCL2 or CXCL10, with new targets covering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase IV inhibitors, ion channel inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, may be potentially effective immunomodulators. However, their efficacies need to be further validated.",

Screening anti-inflammatory activity without screening for antiviral effects can be misleading, since antiviral activity itself may lead to a reduction in inflammation (i.e., anti-inflammatory activity). In this study, we have established the U937 cell model to detect both anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects in one assay. This model can be very useful in the identification of the following three types of agents: (1) Agents that only have antiviral effects (2) Agents that only have anti-inflammatory effects. (3) Agents that have both anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects.",
