The success can be largely attributed to intensive donor testing for TTIs, supplemented by donor education and deferral of donors with risk factors. The two latter approaches have reduced the number of donors with window-period infections and contributed to a decrease in confirmed transmissible disease-positive allogeneic donors over the last decade in Canada, most notably for HBV and HCV [9]. Thus, the residual risk of TTIs is low by any standard.",

Other emerging infections are being monitored (eg, babesiosis, hepatitis E, CHIKV) while others such as influenza feature in contingency planning, in spite of not being transfusion-transmitted, due to their potential to disrupt blood donation and the health care system.

In humans, febrile illness occurs in 20% to 30% of WNV cases and 1% of patients have serious neurologic symptoms. Since most cases are asymptomatic, TTI testing is the primary means of preventing transmission [11]. Universal donor testing was adopted in 2003 using nucleic acid testing (NAT). However, given the seasonal nature of WNV outbreaks, a more nuanced testing methodology was introduced by CBS in June 2015 that recognizes the lack of local transmission during the winter months. Now, all donors are tested from June 1 to November 30 and only donors who travel outside of Canada are tested during the rest of the calendar year.",

Chagas is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic to Central and South America and Mexico, where it is estimated that 6 \u2013 7 million people have been infected [12]. With increasing northward immigration of people from these regions, it is estimated that > 300,000 people are infected in the United States, and most American blood services have implemented universal donor testing [13], [14]. The rates of immigration from endemic countries are lower in Canada and thus CBS tests donors who are identified to be at risk based on the donor questionnaire. Those considered at high risk include those who were born or lived in an endemic country, or had a mother or maternal grandmother that was born or lived in an endemic country. The safety of this approach was demonstrated in a recent study that identified no evidence of infection amongst donors without risk factors identified on the questionnaire (with the exception of one very unusual transfusion transmission \u2013 vertical transmission case) [15]. Interestingly, the selective testing approaches used for WNV and Chagas disease at CBS represent a change from the universal testing approach of the last three decades, which can be summed up as \u201ctest everyone for everything\u201d. The newer approach to certain TTIs takes into account geographic location, seasonal effects, and other risk factors in setting the optimal testing strategy.",

Babesiosis is caused by the protozoan parasites B microti, B duncani, and others in this genus, and spread by infected ticks. Most infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized, but the spectrum of clinical severity also includes flu-like symptoms, ranging to more severe illness and death in the immunocompromised [16]. Babesia microti is the most frequently transfusion-transmitted microbial pathogen in the United States, especially in the Northeast and Upper Midwest states [17]. There were 160 transfusion-transmitted cases reported from 1979 to 2009 in the United States with one case reported in Canada [18]. Hepatitis E is clinically similar to hepatitis A and it causes water-borne outbreaks in developing countries. In Canada, where it was previously thought to be primarily a disease of travelers, the actual prevalence of endemic hepatitis E is unknown. No cases of transmission by transfusion have been reported in North America, but transfusion transmission has been reported in endemic countries and recently in the United Kingdom [19]. CHIKV and dengue are two viruses common in the tropics that are spread by mosquitos. Both lead to similar acute illnesses with fever, rash, and muscle/joint pain. Transfusion-transmitted cases of dengue have been reported. CHIKV arrived in the Caribbean in 2013 and was thus identified as a threat to North America [20]. However, no transfusion transmitted cases of CHIKV have been reported to date. Current malaria travel deferral provides some protection with respect to many but not all of the affected areas, particularly in the Caribbean.",

A recent Babesia seroprevalence study for B microti in Canadian blood donors demonstrated that donor testing is not warranted in Canada at this time [22]. Dr Fearon presented as-yet-unpublished data on a collaborative CBS and H\u00e9ma-Quebec (the transfusion service for Quebec province) hepatitis E seroprevalence study that indicated that age is the only significant factor for increasing seroprevalence of hepatitis E.

In a general sense, this evolution can be potentiated by the consumption of wild meat (meat from non-domesticated mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds). Through careful phylogenetic analysis of simian and human viruses, Africa has been recognized as the \u201chot spot\u201d for HIV emergence, probably due to consumption of primate bush-meat by humans, [29]. Urbanization, poor sanitation, and crowding in the developing world have also been linked to hepatitis E emergence [31].

Such unpredictability requires regular surveillance and hemovigilance efforts to be in place around the world. Disease surveillance has many challenges, but warning signals may help focus efforts to better monitor disease spread. These warning signals may include disease outbreaks in particularly susceptible populations (such as the immunocompromised), and/or the blood-borne nature of a disease.",

For example, only 2% of HIV cases were transfusion-transmitted during the HIV epidemic [32]. Similarly, only 23 of 400,000 WNV cases (0.006%) were established as TTIs [33]. In other words, outbreaks are not likely to start from a transfusion, and transfused patients are not necessarily more likely to acquire an infection than the general population. For an infectious disease to be considered a transfusion-transmissible disease, certain pathogen-related and recipient-related characteristics have to be present. First, the pathogen must have an asymptomatic blood-borne phase (such as hepatitis B), which may either be acute or chronic. Second, the pathogen must be able to survive the donated blood processing and storage procedures, including temperature changes, leukoreduction, and centrifugation. Third, the disease must be transmissible by the intravenous route. Fourth, the recipient has to be susceptible to infection. Fifth, the disease must be a recognizable entity in the recipient once symptoms appear.",

The top priority was assigned to 3 pathogens towards which intellectual and future resources should be focused: dengue viruses; Babesia species; and prions causing human vCJD [34]. The list also included CHIKV, Plasmodium species, T cruzi, human parvovirus B19, HIV, and hepatitis E. An EID tool-kit (Fig 2\n) was subsequently developed as a framework to guide health professionals and public health officials in triaging and managing infectious threats to the blood supply [35]. The EID tool-kit presents: a variety of methods for EID surveillance; key questions to be asked when a threat is suspected; and potential courses of action based on the situation.",

West Nile fever is caused by a flavivirus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. The virus spread from southern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East to India, and arrived in the United States in 1999. By 2004 WNV was endemic in most of the continental US and Canada [33]. The experience of WNV in the US demonstrated that imported infections can be overwhelming and unpredictable. While WNV was considered a stable disease elsewhere in the world, in North America it was experienced as an explosive outbreak in 2002 and 2003 infecting over 400,000 individuals. Public concern was high as WNV, previously unknown in North America, spread rapidly across the continent via infected birds, and then to humans via mosquitoes. Although human to human transmission is not possible, there is potential for transfusion-associated transmission if the donation occurs during periods of pre-symptomatic viremia. NAT of pooled donor samples offered a rapid route to testing. Like other North American blood operators, CBS tests donors in pools. If a pool tests positive, individual donor testing is initiated. After NAT was initiated in the US in 2003, cases of transfusion-transmitted WNV have only rarely been encountered [33].",

Dr Dodd described several emerging agents for which there is some evidence that that have or an assumption that they may be transfusion-transmitted including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (no reported transfusion transmission [TT]), Q Fever (one report of TT, but no definitive evidence), Hepatitis E Virus (good evidence of occasional TT), vCJD, and other prions (evidence for TT) [35]. Dr Dodd focused on two viruses that are current causes for concern. Dengue virus is an important arbovirus. Like WNV, it is a flavivirus and is spread by mosquitos (Aedes genus). Humans are the amplifying host, and while a vaccine is under investigation there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment. Vector control is the only effective intervention. There are an estimated 390 million infections per annum worldwide [37]. In 50% to 80% of cases infection is asymptomatic. Dengue viruses have been found to be transfusion-transmitted in 7 separate geographic clusters in Hong Kong, Singapore, Puerto Rico, and Brazil. Currently, there is no FDA-licensed test for dengue RNA [37], [38]. CHIKV, which has caused recent massive outbreaks in the Caribbean and co-exists with dengue virus, is a potential threat to the North American blood supply due to its geographic proximity and donor travel patterns [39]. CHIKV recently appeared in the Caribbean. Should it arrive in North America, donors could be deferred for exposure or symptoms, NAT testing for CHIKV RNA could be initiated, and red cell and plasma collections could even be stopped. Dr Dodd stated that pathogen inactivation will likely become increasingly important in preventing transfusion-transmission of emerging agents. The American Red Cross in Puerto Rico is currently involved in a trial to investigate and monitor the safety of INTERCEPT pathogen inactivation technology (Cerus Corporation). INTERCEPT was recently approved by the FDA for use with apheresis platelets. Use of INTERCEPT to make available pathogen-reduced apheresis platelets could prevent interruptions in the local platelet supply in areas where viruses like CHIKV emerge [40].",

Ebola infections seem to emerge due to the interconnection of enzootic and epizootic cycles [41]. The first sequence involves bats as the most likely reservoir host for the virus, which is spread by enzootic transmission within the bat population. From this pool of virus carriers, transmission to other non-human species is thought to happen in an epizootic cycle. Initial transmission to humans involves contact with infected bats or other species through hunting or accidental contact with ill wild animals. Human-to-human spread via direct close contact is then very efficient.",

Since 1976, more than 20 outbreaks have been recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa leading to hundreds of cases and deaths [45]. Historically, infection has been controlled by local communities with the isolation of any patient showing symptoms. However, in 2014 in West Africa, the outbreak was on an unprecedented scale. Dr McGeer provided an eye-opening overview of health infrastructure in the affected West African countries. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have populations of 11.5, 4.2, and 6 million, respectively (vs 35 million in Canada). Spending on health (total expenditure per capita) is US$59, US$88, US$228, and US$4759 in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Canada, respectively [46]. This imbalance is mirrored in the number of doctors per 100,000 population: 10, 1.4, 2.2 for Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, respectively, compared to 245.2 in the United States of America [47].

Some analysts have predicted the complete deforestation of Sierra Leone within the next few years [48]. The forests are the habitat for fruit bats, Ebola's probable reservoir host.

Dr Turner began by mentioning some milestones in the history of blood transfusion, highlighting a number of events that took place in his adopted home city of Edinburgh, Scotland. For example, in 1816 the first systematic experiments in intra-species transfusion were carried out by John Henry Leacock, who was studying in Edinburgh at the time. James Blundell, a University of Edinburgh medical school graduate, is credited with conducting the first successful human transfusions several years later. Since early in the last century, transfusion has become a mainstay of clinical practice with around 92 million RBC transfusions conducted annually world-wide [57]. For the most part, and particularly in developed countries, blood transfusion is safe. However, limitations remain, including sufficiency of supply, immunological compatibility of the donor and recipient, the risk of TTIs, and the risk of other complications such as iron overload. Many of these limitations could potentially be overcome by the production of RBCs for transfusion in the laboratory. Dr Turner's talk focused on human stem cells and their potential use for the ex vivo generation of RBCs for transfusion. Dr Turner discussed the biological and engineering limitations that must be overcome in order for ex vivo generated cells to become viable alternatives to donor-derived RBCs.",

There are various types of stem cells, including those derived from embryos (eg, human embryonic stem cells [hESCs]) and from adults. Not all stem cells are the same. For example, hESCs are pluripotent and have unlimited ability to replicate, whereas adult-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can differentiate into cells of the hematopoietic and immune systems and have limited ability to replicate.",

In vivo, HSPCs are found in a hypoxic environment at the edges of the bone marrow. As they differentiate, they move more centrally in the marrow into an environment with a higher O2 tension. It has long been known that when placed into agar/semi-solid medium and provided with the right cytokine support, HSPCs can differentiate along different hematopoietic lineages, forming granulocyte/monocyte, and erythroid colonies with 7 to 14 days [59]. Culturing HSPCs in suspension using a two-phase culture system has several advantages over solid-phase culture [60], the in vitro environment can be more precisely controlled and can be separated more easily [61], [62]. Dr Turner provided an overview of a two stage culture system which uses combinations of cytokines to control cell differentiation and proliferation and can be used to produce erythroid cells from CD34 + adult peripheral blood cells. During the enucleation process, which moves the cells into the early reticulocyte stage, the nucleus is extruded from the cell, and engulfed by macrophages. By days 10 to 14 of the two-stage culture, the population consists of approximately 50% normoblasts and 50% early (R1) reticulocytes. Other 3-stage systems have had demonstrated success expanding CD34 + HSPC from peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cord blood into functional RBCs [63]. These proofs-of-principle demonstrated that RBC generation ex vivo is possible, but processes described to date have limited scalability and do not yet constitute a workable approach to generate RBCs for transfusion.",

            "text": "Dr Turner spent the remainder of his talk discussing the two major types of challenges facing the ex vivo generation of RBCs for transfusion: biological challenges and engineering/logistical challenges. From the biological point of view, one major challenge is to determine the best source from which to derive the cells. Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), one potential source of ex vivo RBCs, have a limited replication capacity; they could generate a small number of units of RBC but the reliance on donors remains. Unlike HSCs, hESCs have indefinite expansion capabilities and can self-renew, and were a source of much excitement when their derivation was first described [64]. hESCs are pluripotent \u2013 they can be cultured indefinitely as cell lines and are able to differentiate into all the cells of the body including hematopoietic cells [65]. In 2006, a considerably less ethically-controversial source of pluripotent stem cells was discovered\u2013 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [66], [67] earning the discoverer the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2012. Initially generated by Takahashi and Yamanaka from human somatic skin fibroblasts by the use of four genes (Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/Myc), iPSCs are very similar to hESCs, can be differentiated into all three germ layers and have huge potential for regenerative medicine applications and disease modeling. Like hESCs, human iPSCs can be differentiated into hematopoietic cells in vitro [68], [69], [70], [71], and this is an area of intensive research [72]. Dr Turner provided an overview of a system by which RBCs can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) in vitro using a feeder/serum free approach and cytokine mixes that drive the hPSC to HSPCs, then erythroblasts, normoblasts, and eventually reticulocytes over an approximately 30-day time frame. The differentiation process is complex and uses mixes of multiple cytokines and small molecules. Several issues remain including the long differentiation time, and the fact that while hPSC-derived RBCs can enucleate, the resulting cells are fragile and difficult to maintain in culture. The hPSC-derived RBCs express \u03b1/\u03b3 globin chains, the same combination of hemoglobin polypeptides expressed in fetal RBCs (as opposed to \u03b1/\u03b2 globin chains in adult RBCs); however, the oxygen-delivering characteristics of the hPSC-derived RBCs are acceptable and therefore this would not preclude their use. Efforts are underway to optimize erythrocyte differentiation and enucleation and modify the hemoglobin to a more adult form [73], [74].",

Conditional immortalization from hPSCs or adult HSPC can be achieved using human papilloma virus E6/E7 or combinations of transcription factors. This approach can establish immortalized human erythroid progenitor cell lines [75]. Switching off the immortalization allows the production of enucleate RBCs ex vivo. This approach has several benefits over PSC-as a starting material: the process is less complex and the differentiation time is shorter; there are reduced costs related to cytokines, growth factors, and media; and the final RBC phenotype is closer to an adult phenotype. The feasibility of this approach to produce enucleated RBCs has been shown [75]. Potential drawbacks of this approach include concerns regarding: the introduction of oncogenes into the cells; cell line stability; and the likelihood of being able to meet good manufacturing practice standards and produce clinical grade products.",

The key issues here are scale-up, process control, and intensification. Dr Turner described the use of the Ambr bioreactor technology (from TAP Biosystems, part of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group) as an approach to optimising the in vitro culture environment. Stirred tank bioreactors are a mature technology that is scalable and well-established for production of biotherapeutics. They allow for precise control of several physico-chemical parameters and economic/rapid development screening at a variety of scales (10 mL, 250 mL, multi-liter). There are two gross limits to system efficiency. The first is the absolute density limit, which is calculated from specific oxygen uptake rate of cells and the mass transfer coefficient of the system. In this regard, the bioreactor system performs well; high density can be achieved, and the potential is certainly there to succeed in scaling it up to the needs of producing erythroid cells. The second limit is media volumetric productivity (liters of media/units of blood). Volumetric productivity is precisely determined by cell growth rate and specific support capacity of the media\u2014consumption and supplementation. Specific rates are unstable and supplementation with glucose and glutamine does not improve growth, suggesting these are not limiting factors. In order for potential scale-up of this system, the limiting factors need to be identified.",

            "text": "Dr Naccache commenced her presentation by contrasting \u201cclassical\u201d DNA sequencing methods with next generation sequencing (NGS). Frederick Sanger and colleagues invented a method of DNA sequence determination in the 1970s [79] that was intensively used by scientists for the next 25 years [80]. Sanger sequencing was based on the selective and partial incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleotides into copies of the DNA strand being sequenced, and their separation by denaturing electrophoresis into a readable sequence \u201cladder\u201d. Dr Naccache stressed that Sanger sequencing, even in later, high throughput versions, was employed on one limited piece of DNA (typically a small DNA sector amplified using PCR) at a time to yield a single output sequence. Although this method was sufficiently advanced to be used to sequence first the human mitochondrial genome [81] and then the entire human genome [82], [83], its robustness pales in comparison to NGS approaches. NGS yields huge amounts of DNA sequence in parallel; in other words, many sequences in a sample can be analyzed simultaneously [84]. For this reason, NGS is also called deep or massively parallel or high throughput sequencing. Its information output is such that thousands or millions of sequences can be provided concurrently, in a matter of hours. NGS has made possible metagenomic approaches, in which all DNA sequences from all genomes present in a clinical sample can be identified. This approach can now be used to determine if a blood sample contains only human DNA, or human DNA plus the DNA of an infectious pathogen, as well as to identify that pathogen if its sequence is known.",

All DNA/RNA present in a sample is first rapidly extracted (or copied using PCR) and fragmented into pieces of uniform length, providing a library. Short artificial DNA sequences are then bonded onto either end of all library DNA fragments. These adaptors allow hybridization of one strand of the modified DNA to complementary, tethered pieces of DNA in a flow cell. They are then \u201csequenced by synthesis\u201d using fluorescent deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate building blocks. As each base is added to the growing chain, its position is noted via imaging and the positional information is captured in parallel. NGS can therefore provide 10 to 100 Gigabytes of data\u2014much of it \u201credundant\u201d in that the same sequence has been detected and read multiple times\u2014to ensure sufficient coverage of all DNA sequence present in a sample. This huge amount of data is first processed using algorithms that detect and remove low quality reads, and then the \u201chost\u201d or human genome sequence information is subtracted. The remaining DNA is assembled into contiguous arrays by alignment of overlapping sequences, and compared to reference genomes of known pathogens. If an identified pathogen differs slightly from reference genomes, taxonomic classification can then be done to determine how recently the variant has diverged from known sequences. Dr Naccache stressed that this approach will work on bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens, all encoded by RNA- or DNA-based genomes, but not on prions, which are protein-based pathogens that infect by causing host proteins to take on pathological conformations.",

Dr Naccache surveyed the rapid development of commercial deep sequencing machines [85]. First to market in 2005 was Roche, with its 454 Sequencer, capable of 500 000 reads of 350 to 550 bp. Illumina and Ion Torent produced instruments that generated millions to billions of reads of slightly shorter sizes of 50 to 300 bp, with similar overall run times, between 2009 and 2014. These products all worked on the paradigm of sequencing by synthesis. The most recent entries into this instrumentation field work on a different principle, called nanopore sequencing: Pac Bio's RS apparatus (2011); and Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinION (2014). Both instruments are capable of a smaller number of reads than earlier machines (up to 100,000) but the reads are much longer, up to 40,000 bp. The technology works on the principle of detecting a growing DNA chain electrically when the chain is extruded through an engineered protein pore of nanometer diameter. The MinION instrument is amazingly small to essentially the size of a large memory stick [86].",

Dr Naccache and co-workers developed a bioinformatics platform for these tasks called SURPI, Sequence-based Ultra-Rapid Pathogen Identification [87]. Such platforms are necessary given the size of the NGS output DNA sequence, the size of pathogen reference sequence databases, and the fact that pathogen sequences typically constitute no more than 0.001% to 1% of reads in the NGS output. This presents a needle in a haystack-type problem. To achieve rapid and robust detection, SURPI employs two analyzer programs that work on both DNA and translated protein alignments, using bacterial and viral databases. The platform can be employed in either fast or comprehensive mode; in fast mode pathogenic sequences can be identified in a clinical sample in minutes to hours, while comprehensive mode is more appropriate for detection of a novel pathogen's entire genome or to rule out infection in a clinically complex case. Dr Naccache noted that 20% to 30% of clinically significant respiratory infections are currently of unknown etiology.",

In view of the patient's poor status and the safety of the specific treatment for Leptospira had the NGS-based diagnosis been incorrect, intravenous penicillin treatment was commenced before confirmation of Leptospira infection was received from the Center for Disease Control. Following 2 weeks' treatment followed by rehabilitation, the patient made a full recovery. In the second case highlighted by the speaker, a 42-year-old man underwent a bone marrow transplant, with immunosuppression, for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [89]. A month later he developed tinnitus and partial deafness, which progressed rapidly and was accompanied by increasing mental deterioration. Brain biopsy tissue was assessed by NGS, which detected neuroinvasive astrovirus infection, for which there is no known efficacious therapy; the patient died 4 months post-NGS diagnosis and 7.5 months after the onset of symptoms.

The UCSF/AVDDC group also found parvovirus-like hybrid virus by NGS in their hepatitis cohorts, but eventually realized that the virus was present in commercial silica-type spin columns used for DNA purification/concentration, but not in any original patient sample [92].

She assessed this outcome as somewhat improbable over the near term, in part because blood donation screening is currently highly effective. NGS is currently quite expensive in its most accurate form, leading Dr Naccache to estimate the cost of a well-covered NGS study of around 10 samples using a total of 300 million sequences on the HiSeq platform at US$3000 , and a more shallow study, of the kind described above for rapid detection of Ebola and CHIKV, of around 6 samples using a total of 30 million sequences on the MiSeq platform, at US$1500. However, these estimates do not truly take into account the substantial infrastructure in place at UCSF/AVVDC, which comprises specialized equipment for sample extraction, library generation, and validation, NGS sequencing, and extensive computational analysis, not to mention the skills of medical technologists, researchers, and bioinformatics specialists. The relevance of NGS with respect to keeping the blood system safe from emerging pathogens will more likely lie in determining patterns of disease transmission and providing the confidence necessary to re-qualify a previously deferred blood donor. Suspected transmission by transfusion can be identified rapidly with great sensitivity and specificity using NGS of all implicated donors and recipients. It can also be used in a general, epidemiological sense, to trace patterns of infection and adaptation and speciation of infectious agents. While the contributions of NGS to clinical diagnosis of intractable cases and to public health, with respect to tracking and understanding disease outbreaks are already substantial, and will likely continue to accumulate exponentially, the prospects of using NGS for routine blood donation screening remain remote due to cost and throughput considerations.",

The common trend is a negative impact on routine quality measures as well as newer tools introduced to further characterize platelet quality and functionality; however, the magnitude of the effect can be different dependent on the PI technology. Amongst other effects, PI treatment increases metabolism, apoptosis development, and platelet activation. These features lead to decreased platelet responsiveness and in vitro clot formation [103]. Furthermore, the effect of PI treatment on novel aspects of platelet function has also been extensively investigated. These studies show PI-dependent effects on cytokine [104], mitochondrial DNA and microparticle release [105], [106], [107], generation of reactive oxygen species and initiation of signaling cascades [108], and expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA [109], [110]. These \u201cnovel\u201d platelet features might assist with explaining PI-effects associated with increased inflammation, cell damage, and apoptosis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and modulation of endothelial cell functions. In addition, studies of the effects of PI on the proteome of platelets could provide further insights into mechanisms, although the overall impact on the protein expression profile is relatively small [111], suggesting PI-triggered modulations of protein activities. Finally, some of Dr Schubert's own work on elucidating signaling cascades in Mirasol-treated platelets revealed a central role of p38MAPK in regulating platelet activation and apoptosis development [112], [113].",

The Cerus S-303 system for PI of RBCs demonstrated similar 24-hour recovery to standard RBCs, but these products would not meet Canadian standards due to their decreased shelf life [114]. Dr Schubert then discussed how PI of whole blood may be a more efficient approach compared to PI of individual components. Potential benefits of whole blood PI include early removal of pathogens, protection against transfusion-associated graft versus host disease due to WBC inactivation, and increased safety of all blood product components. The application of the Mirasol technology on whole blood has demonstrated efficacy against HIV [115], Trypansoma cruzi\n[116], and B microti\n[117]. Most recently, a study using Mirasol for malaria inactivation in whole blood has been performed in Ghana [118]. However, reduction of TTIs must be balanced against the effect that whole blood PI has on blood component quality. A study of in vivo viability of stored RBCs derived from Mirasol-treated whole blood suggests decreased viability that correlates with quality variables such as hemolysis and ATP concentration [119]. This approach was complemented by a study by Schubert and colleagues further demonstrating that platelet product quality seems to be less affected when produced from whole blood illumination compared to platelet component treatment [120].",

For example, the FDA annually tracks data on fatalities related to blood collection, transfusion reactions, and transmissible diseases (http://www.fda.gov). Microbial fatalities from transfusion are tracked using variables that experts deem important for focusing future pathogen testing and inactivation efforts such as by the type organism and blood product. These fatality reports help determine the relative burden of fatalities from different causes. As a result, it was shown that in the United States, platelet-related deaths are mainly caused by bacteria and red cell-related deaths are mainly attributable to Babesia.

Scientists may make various assumptions when measuring health resource outcomes, from choosing the wrong outcome to choosing an inappropriate test to measure it. These limitations, as well as an incomplete knowledge base, lead to uncertainty in data used for health economic analyses. When measuring health costs, one assumes that some expenditures are more important than others for the health care system; when measuring consequences from an intervention, one assumes that there is a sufficient understanding of the risks and benefits associated with that intervention. Cost per QALY provides a common denominator for comparing interventions, but cannot reduce uncertainty introduced by unavoidable assumptions.",

The data estimate that platelet bacterial testing is more cost-effective ($91,000/QALY) than pathogen inactivation ($497,000/QALY) [123]. When implementation of a cost-effective blood donor test is needed, QALY has been applied to several patient populations and several interventions. Bell et al compared platelet PI using INTERCEPT in leukemia, lymphoma, orthopedic, and cardiac patients [124]. The authors found that the new method's cost effectiveness ($/QALY) is similar to other accepted blood safety interventions. This means the method can be considered cost-effective in the blood safety context while preserving patient quality of life. Dr Custer and colleagues have modeled the cost-effectiveness of PI as an addition to current pathogen testing based on Canadian data. Comparing Mirasol treatment of whole blood, and of platelet and plasma, costs per QALY of $1,276,000 and $1,423,000, respectively (CDN, in this instance), were shown [125]. A more recent cost-utility analysis of implementing PI in Poland suggest high costs, but better cost-effectiveness than found in previous analyses of PI and nucleic acid testing in North America [126].",

Health economic analysis allows quantification of alternatives and comparison of interventions in different areas of medicine. Broad implementation of PI for blood safety may thus prove unpalatable to funders without compensatory cost reductions in other aspect of component production. Either a more focused application of PI or lack of implementation until lower-cost alternatives are developed may ensue. Decision making based on health economics and on risk assessments is likely to become the new norm in blood transfusion. This would comprise a strikingly different approach to blood safety implementation and decision making than in the past, when novel interventions were added to older ones, sequentially increasing costs and overall blood safety budgets. This shift represents a move towards effectively and transparently managing process change, rather than the traditional approach of reactive change in response to an emerging situation or disaster.",

The 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic reinforced concerns about environmental change fueling the rapid emergence of pathogens not previously thought to have potential global significance. Pathogen inactivation of blood products may further reduce residual risk from established agents and provide protection from new agents in the medium term; however, the most likely driver for a paradigm shift to the use of pathogen inactivation is to reduce the ever-present risk of bacterial contamination of platelet products. Longer term, the possibility of donor-free cellular products and rapid next generation sequencing could drive down transfusion-transmission rates even further than the impressive safety margins now in place in Canada and other developed countries. Health economic analysis and risk-based decision making will be required to determine if anticipated benefits outweigh the considerable costs of these potential steps.",
