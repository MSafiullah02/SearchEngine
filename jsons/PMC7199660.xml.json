The standard protocol when treating for suspected BRD in feedlot cattle is to administer an injectable antimicrobial. However, it is also common for veterinarians to prescribe an additional treatment, or ancillary therapy (ANC), along with the antimicrobial. The goal of ANC is to improve the response to a BRD challenge in calves treated with antimicrobials, not to replace antimicrobial treatment. This can be accomplished by relieving the harmful effects of inflammation, blocking histamine activity, or boosting immune system function to aid in the defense against infectious pathogens (Apley, 1994).",

Terrell et al. (2011) reported that 48% of veterinarians recommended some form of ANC for the treatment of BRD. Recently, NAHMS (2013) released an updated survey detailing additional ANC use in feedlots. The most common forms of ANC listed in the surveys included antihistamines, B vitamins, corticosteroids, direct-fed microbials, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), viral vaccines, and vitamin C (NAHMS, 2001; Terrell et al., 2011; NAHMS, 2013). Although these surveys provide evidence as to the scope of ANC use, there is limited published research on the efficacy of these ANC. Hence, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of 3 of the most common ANC used in combination with an antimicrobial on the performance, health, and immune response variables of newly received high-risk calves treated for clinical BRD.",

Signs of abnormal appetite included an animal that was completely off feed, an animal eating less than expected or eating extremely slowly, a lack of gut fill or gaunt appearance, and obvious BW loss. Respiratory signs included labored breathing, extended head and neck (in an attempt to breathe), and audible noise when breathing.

The goal of ANC therapy is to improve the response to a BRD challenge in calves treated with antimicrobials, and there is potential justification for ANC use based on the modes of actions of various ANC. However, published research has yet to suggest that ANC other than NSAID are effective in commercial settings in response to a natural BRD challenge. Although NSAID have demonstrated the ability to decrease rectal temperatures in treated calves, the response is usually short-lived and not evident at the end of the evaluation period. It has also been suggested that NSAID may decrease lung consolidation at harvest, but this has been demonstrated in only a few experiments. For all of the variables measured in the current experiment, observed responses to the 3 ANC were negligible during both the receiving and finishing periods. The lack of observed positive responses in calves given the 3 ANC used in this experiment compared with calves receiving NOAC leads us to conclude that the use of NSAID, VACC, and VITC as an ANC for BRD does not appear to be warranted. In addition, this experiment suggests that ANC use could potentially have negative effects on calf performance during the receiving period if administered to calves experiencing a severe natural immune challenge.",
