            "text": "Even though fractional-order calculus (FOC) and differential equations (FODEs) have nearly the same history as those of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), they did not attract much attention till recent decades [1]. FOC, expressed as a generalization of ordinary differentiation and integration to arbitrary non-integer order and extensively used in different fields of science recently, is a branch of mathematical analysis [2,3]. Most important feature of FOC is memory concept. If the output of a system at each time t depends only on the input at time t, then such systems are said to be memoryless systems. Otherwise, if the system has to remember previous values of the input to specify the current value of the output, then such systems are called memory systems [4]. In modeling of various memory phenomena, it is mentioned that a memory process usually consists of two stages. One is short with permanent retention, and the other is governed by a simple model of fractional derivative [5]. Numerous literature has been developed on the applications of FODEs and their systems (FOSs), a new and powerful tool that has recently been employed to model complex structures with nonlinear behavior and long-term memory [6], [7], [8]. Especially, biological systems are also rich source for mathematical modeling through FOSs [9].",

Currently, there exist 21 families of viruses expressed to cause diseases in humans. Some of these diseases are very seriously infectious diseases such as AIDS (acquired immuno deficiency syndrome), Hepatitis, Herpes Simplex, Measles, avian influenza, SARS and SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus [23]. They have common features, such as they are all highly pathogenic to humans or livestock [24]. In particular AIDS, most severe stage of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection, is remarkable as a fatal disease [25]. Considering the World Health Organization's report on the global situation and HIV/AIDS trends in 2018, there was globally about 37.9 million people living with HIV, 23.3 million people accessed antiretroviral therapy, 1.7 million people newly became infected with HIV and 770 thousand people died from AIDS-related illnesses [26]. HIV spreads only through certain body fluids such as blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk, from an HIV-infected person. The immune response plays an important role to control the dynamics of viral infections such as HIV\n[21]. Mathematical models aimed to understand the host-virus interaction in case of HIV can supply non-intuitive information about the dynamics of the host response to the viruses and they can also offer new ways for the theraphy. In recent years, the HIV models with cure rate has received a great deal of attention.",

The production of uninfected cells is at a constant rate, \u03bb. When uninfected cells encounter with free virus particles, they become infected at a rate \u03b2xv. d and b are rates of the natural death of uninfected cells and CTL cells, respectively. The infected cells die at an additional rate ay, which is the viral caused cell death (cytopathicity or cytotoxicity). Infected cells produce new virus particles with a rate ky, and the free virus particles that have been released from the cells decay with a rate u. The proliferation rate of CTL cells in the presence of infected cells is c. Finally, CTL cells cleans infected cells with the ratio \u03c1 from the host. They explained the stabilities of the infection-free equilibrium and the positive equilibrium according to the basic reproduction number of the virus. Thus, they stimulated a model to work, aimed at interpreting experimental data, and led to the development of a new field of study called as viral dynamics.",

[34] also considered the effect of antiviral drugs for Eqs (1), and so, the efficacy of these drugs was estimated by mathematical modeling for retroviruses such as HIV\u22121. While a protease inhibitor causes infected cells to produce immature non-infectious virus particles, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor effectively blocks the successful infection of a cell. In this sense, they assumed that when an antiretroviral drug such as a protease inhibitor or a reverse transcriptase inhibitor are applied to a patient in steady state as the viral load falls. To model this fall, the effectiveness of the drug is introduced into the model. Therefore, the virus dynamics is reformed to the following ODEs:(2)dxdt=\u03bb\u2212dx\u2212(1\u2212\u03f5RT)\u03b2xvIdydt=(1\u2212\u03f5RT)\u03b2xvI\u2212aydvIdt=(1\u2212\u03f5PI)ky\u2212uvIdvNIdt=\u03f5PIky\u2212uvNIwith positive initial conditions. Also, \u03f5RT and \u03f5PI are the efficacies of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor and protease inhibitor, respectively, and vI and vNI, denote infectious and non-infectious virions, respectively. This division of virions is because of the use of protease inhibitors. They performed stability analysis of the equilibrium points of their model. Based on Eqs (2), several nonlinear models given in [35], [36], [37] through ODEs and [38,39] through FODEs have been developed to describe the dynamics of the HIV\u22121 virus, which take into account the dynamics of the HIV infection through antiretroviral therapies with different cell populations.",
