            "text": "Cyclopeptide alkaloids are one of the chemotaxonomic specific constituents in Rhamnaceae plants, especially for Ziziphus species. They usually contain a p- or m-ansa 13-, 14-, or 15-membered ring structure that consists of a styrylamine moiety and two or three \u03b1-amino acid residues (Tan and Zhou, 2006). In some cases, they possess one or two N-methyl or N,N-dimethyl amino acids. Cyclopeptide alkaloids of Rhamnaceae plants are divided into three types: Ia, Ib, or Ic, according to ring structure size. The Ib-type alkaloids have 13-membered macrocyclic structures composed of a m-oxystyrylamino moiety, a ring bond amino acid, and a \u03b2-oxyproline moiety as an intermediate amino acid. Sedative, antibacterial, antifungal, antiplasmodial, antimycobacterial, and antimalarial effects have been reported for some cyclopeptide alkaloids (Gournelis et al., 1998, Panseeta et al., 2011, Tan and Zhou, 2006).",

Although the fruit is the most widely used part of the plant for food, cyclopeptide alkaloids have been separated from other plant parts, especially from the stem bark. Four Ia-type (frangufoline, scutianine D, jubanine C, and mauritine A) and eight Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids (amphibine H, jubanine A, jubanine B, jubanine E, mucronine D, nummularine A, nummularine B, and zizyphine A) have been isolated and reported from the Z. jujuba stem bark (Devi et al., 1987, Pandey et al., 2008, Tripathi et al., 2001, Tschesche et al., 1976). However, the chemical constituents of Z. jujuba roots have been rarely reported. To the best of our knowledge, only one publication has reported cyclopeptide alkaloids from the Z. jujuba root. These alkaloids are mauritine A and seven Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids: mucronine D, amphibine H, jubanine A, jubanine B, jubanine D, nummularine A, and nummularine B (Khokhar et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Air-dried pulverized roots of Z. jujuba were macerated with MeOH before preparing the alkaloid fraction with an acid-base method from the MeOH extract. This alkaloid fraction was subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluted with increasingly polar mixtures of CHCl3/MeOH. Further purification was performed using Sephadex LH-20 and preparative HPLC. As a result, eight cyclopeptide alkaloids (1\u20138) were isolated and chemically characterized. The UV spectra of 1\u20138 showed absorption bands at around 270 and 320 nm, which were caused by the characteristic styrylamine chromophore (Panseeta et al., 2011). All eight compounds, therefore, could be 13-membered cyclopeptide alkaloids. This is because these absorption bands are not observed with 14-membered rings due to the strain of the ring system, except when there is a tryptophan moiety (Gournelis et al., 1998). Three aromatic protons of the cyclopeptides exhibited an ABX spin system, e.g. \u03b4\nH 6.70 (1H, d, J\n = 3.2 Hz, H-12), \u03b4\nH 6.87 (1H, d, J\n = 9.2 Hz, H-15), and \u03b4\nH 6.80 (1H, dd, J\n = 3.2, 9.2 Hz, H-16) for 1 (Table 2). This suggests that compounds 1\u20138 had a m-oxystyrylamino moiety, which then suggests that they are 13-membered cyclopeptide alkaloids (Lin et al., 2000). In addition, based on 1H\u20131H COSY and 1H\u201313C HMBC spectroscopic data analyses and comparison with previously reported chemical shift analogs, the presence of a \u03b2-oxyproline moiety is possible for compounds 1\u20138 (Tan and Zhou, 2006). Thus, compounds 1\u20138 were confirmed as Ib-type cyclopeptide alkaloids. The olefinic protons (H-1 and H-2) of 1\u20138 showed coupling constants (J) near 9.0 Hz, and a double bond geometry in styrylamino moieties were indicated to be in Z configurations.",

            "text": "Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder with molecular formula C28H41N5O6, as indicated by ESI-qTOF-MS. From the analysis of 1H, 13C, 1H\u20131H COSY, and 1H\u201313C HMBC NMR spectroscopic data (Fig. 2\n), two valines and one terminal N-methylalanine moiety were suggested in 1 (Table 1\n). The HMBC correlations between H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-9 to C-11 indicated linkages between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety and a valine, the valine and a \u03b2-oxyproline, and the \u03b2-oxyproline and the m-oxystyrylamino moiety, respectively. A NOE relationship between H-18 and H-21 was observed, which agreed with the \u03b2-oxyproline connection with another valine moiety. Thus, structure 1 was established as shown in Fig. 1. The CD spectrum of 1 exhibited two negative Cotton effects around 265 and 321 nm, suggesting 5S,8S,9S-configurations (Schmidt et al., 1983). No significant NOE enhancements were observed between H-5/H-8 and H-8/H-9 in the NOESY spectrum. This supported the 5S,8S,9S-configuration. A weak vicinal coupling between H-8 and H-9 (J\n = 3.2 Hz) suggests a trans orientation (Suksamrarn et al., 2005). To confirm the configuration, acid hydrolysis of 1 was performed. The hydrolysate of 1 was treated with the d-FDLA (N\u03b1-(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-d-leucinamide) or l-FDLA (N\u03b1-(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-leucinamide) and the reaction products were analyzed by LC\u2013MS (Fujii et al., 1997). d-FDLA derivatives are retained longer than the l-FDLA derivatives on C-18 reverse phased HPLC, exhibiting amino acid residues of 1 as l-Val and l-N-Me-Ala, respectively. As a result, the configuration of compound 1 is shown in Fig. 1. Compound 1 was named jubanine F after its plant origin.",

Instead of a valine, two methyl (\u03b4\nC 10.8 and 15.1), one methylene (\u03b4\nC 24.5), and one methine (\u03b4\nC 37.4) signals were observed. 1H\u20131H COSY analysis indicated that these comprised an isoleucine residue. The HMBC cross-peaks of H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-22 to C-23 indicated connections between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety with a valine, the valine with a \u03b2-oxyproline, and an isoleucine with a N-methylalanine, respectively. The absolute configurations of C-5, C-8, C-9, C-21, and C-1\u2034 were identified as S, S, S, S, and S by CD and advanced Marfey\u2019s method. However, 2 contained an isoleucine residue, and the absolute configuration at C-1\u2033 was determined by chromatographic analysis on GITC (2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosylisothiocyanate) derivatives (Hess et al., 2004). The GITC derivatives of l-Ile and l-allo-Ile eluted very closely and co-injection experiments proved that the configuration of the Ile residue was l-Ile (21S, 1\u2033S) instead of l-allo-Ile (21S, 1\u2033R). Compound 2 was named jubanine G.",

Different from compounds 1\u20133, compound 4 has N-methyl signals (\u03b4\nH 2.17, s) equivalent to six protons. Thus, 4 was deduced to have a terminal N,N-dimethylalanine instead of a mono-methyl substituted one. Additionally, the presence of a valine and an isoleucine residue was inferred from 1H, 13C, 1H\u20131H COSY, and HMBC NMR spectroscopic data. The links between a m-oxystyrylamino moiety with an isoleucine, the isoleucine with a \u03b2-oxyproline, and a valine with a N,N-dimethylalanine were respectively confirmed through HMBC interactions of H-3 to C-4, H-6 to C-7, and H-22 to C-23. The absolute configurations of 5S, 8S, 9S, 21S, 1\u2032S, and 1\u2033S were identified by the same methods as used for the previous compounds 1\u20133. The absolute configuration of N,N-dimethylalanine was confirmed by chromatographic analyses of the N,N-dimethylalanine with phenylglycine methylester hydrochloride (PGME) amide coupling products (Um et al., 2013). The PGME derivatives of the synthetic N,N-dimethylalanine were analyzed by LC\u2013MS and the synthetic amides of l- and d-N,N-dimethylalanine had retention times of 8.83 min and 10.24 min, respectively. The N,N-dimethylalanine-PGME amide derived from compound 4 was detected at 8.79 min. Thus, the absolute configuration of N,N-dimethylalanine in compound 4 was identified as l (S) and compound 4 was named jubanine I.",

Infection with this virus has been become a serious economic loss in the swine industry and recent outbreaks led to serious economic losses in many swine producing countries. Only compounds 1\u20133, and 6 were screened for their antiviral potential against PEDV, due to the scarce amounts of other compounds that were obtained. Compounds 2, 3, and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on PEDV infected Vero cells, as shown in Table 3\n. Compounds 3 and 6 showed EC50 values at the micromolar range (EC50 4.49 \u00b1 0.67 and 6.17 \u00b1 0.50 \u03bcM, respectively), which was potent as compared to the positive control 6-azauridine (5.58 \u00b1 0.53 \u03bcM).

Compound 2 exhibited lower potency than 3 and 6 (EC50 13.41 \u00b1 1.13 \u03bcM), but 2 also demonstrated high SI values due to the very low cytotoxicity (CC50\n > 400 \u03bcM).",
