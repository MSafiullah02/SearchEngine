            "text": "Because of the size of and difficulty in restraining mice and rats, ophthalmic examination can be challenging. Restraint is best achieved by grasping the animal in the palm of the hand with the heel of the hand cupped under the trunk and tail and by gently stabilizing the head by holding the base of the skull firmly between the thumb and forefinger. An open-ended syringe casing is helpful to facilitate examination of small rodents, such as mice. The head is allowed to extend from the end of the casing, and the tail is grasped gently through the other end. The thumb can be used as a plunger to position the animal for examination. Frequent breaks are helpful to prevent the patients from becoming too stressed. Sedation rarely is required. Mydriasis can be achieved with 1% tropicamide. Melanotic irides of some rodents may resist dilation because of the binding of the drug to uveal melanin. One percent atropine and 10% phenylephrine applied every 5 minutes for up to three applications can be used if necessary [1]. When topical anesthetic is used to perform procedures such as tonometry, only a small amount should be administered because of the potential for systemic toxicity [1].",

            "text": "Mice and rats have three lacrimal structures: the (1) intraorbital gland, (2) extraorbital gland, and (3) Harderian gland. The intraorbital gland is located deep in the retrobulbar space. The extraorbital gland is located near the base of the masseter muscle and commonly has been misinterpreted as a neoplasm because of its unusual location [5]. Gender-related differences in lacrimal gland structure have been documented in rats. The most obvious difference is that the acinar area of males is much larger than that of females [6]. In the rat, the lacrimal duct runs through a fibrous tissue cord that extends between the extraorbital lacrimal gland and the conjunctiva [7]. Because the duct is ensheathed within this dense fibrous cord, it partly is protected from external trauma, ensuring patency. This cord, which is about 2 cm long, runs mainly along the surface of the masseter muscle and courses superficially through subcutaneous tissues. The lacrimal duct extends from the extraorbital gland to the retrobulbar space and continues to the lateral canthal region where it splits into many smaller ducts that join with common ducts of the intraorbital gland. These short ducts open into the conjunctival fornix in the lateral region of the upper or the lower lid. In some adult rats, the openings appear as small white domes that are located close to the eyelid margin and are seen when the eyelids are everted manually. When the domes are present, the actual duct opening is deep within the dome, and the lower dome is usually more prominent. The ductal opening usually is associated with only one of the domes; however, visual inspection cannot determine into which dome the lacrimal duct opens.",

            "text": "The Harderian gland is located posterior to the globe in the orbit. It is pale pink-white, lobulated, and somewhat U-shaped [8]. A single duct extends from the gland to open at the base of the third eyelid. Microscopically, the Harderian gland tends to have a more foamy appearance compared with that of other lacrimal glands because of its high-lipid content. This gland is the only mammalian gland known to secrete lipid by the merocrine mechanism [9]. It is believed that the Harderian gland also contains pheromones that may be important in burrowing species and in facial grooming [8], [10], [11], [12], [13]. In rodents, this gland contains porphyrin, a red-brown pigment [8], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], and also secretes melatonin, which is believed to have a role in extraretinal photoreception [20]. Epiphora, or overflow of tears, usually is associated with red tear staining of the face and commonly results from ocular irritation, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and inflammation of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Excessive production of these red tears is called chromodacryorrhea and can be confused with blood [8]. Ultraviolet light can be used to distinguish these excretions from blood; porphyrin should fluoresce, whereas blood does not [8], [20]. Ocular irritation can be caused by primary disease such as keratitis or conjunctivitis or by irritation caused by soiled bedding or high concentrations of ammonia in the housing environment [4]. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction can result from malocclusion or overgrowth of the lower incisors. The gums and nasal cavity can become inflamed secondary to trauma from the incisors. Swelling then causes obstruction of the duct. Corrective dentistry usually improves the condition [4], [20].",

            "text": "The most common abnormality associated with the lacrimal structures is dacryoadenitis, or inflammation of the Harderian gland. Chromodacryorrhea is the most striking clinical finding in this condition (Fig. 1\n). Dacryoadenitis usually is associated with the sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), which is a coronavirus that is closely related antigenically to mouse hepatitis virus and Parker's rat corona virus [21]. SDAV is a common pathogen of rats [8], and disease can occur as an enzootic infection in breeding colonies or as epizootics in susceptible populations [21]. The virus is highly contagious and spreads rapidly by aerosol, contact, and fomite transmission [8]. Transient sniffling caused by rhinitis is observed 2 to 3 days after artificial innoculation, followed by unilateral or bilateral blepharospasm and photophobia occurring 6 to 8 days after inoculation. Intermandibular swelling caused by involvement of the salivary glands is seen frequently [21]. The most common histologic abnormalities of the acutely affected gland are diffuse edema, necrosis, and widespread infiltration with a mixed population of inflammatory cells [22]. Repair of the Harderian gland is possible, and development of new acinar structures can occur if the basement membrane is not affected severely. Secondary conditions such as keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, uveitis, exophthalmia, and possibly multifocal retinal degeneration can be seen in association with this condition [4]. Permanent sequelae can include corneal fibrosis, anterior and posterior synechiae, cataracts, or glaucoma [4]. Some studies have reported similar infections in mice, but no cause has been identified [8], [23].",

In one laboratory, corneal dystrophy was present in 8% to 10% of aged rats and usually appeared as a localized collection of small, white, punctate opacities. These lesions did not tend to progress after the initial observation [9]. In this same laboratory, mice showed an increase in prevalence of corneal dystrophy with age. The lesions usually were shaped geometrically and comprised a thin layer of mineralization in the anterior stroma (Fig. 3\n). The pathogenesis was not determined but may have been the result of previous keratitis [9]. Corneal degeneration may be a better term for these lesions if this is true. A study involving different strains and stocks of laboratory mice showed that manipulation of the cage environment seemed to influence the occurrence of corneal opacities. In mice living in cages that were cleaned twice weekly, the incidence of corneal opacities was 0.8%, whereas in mice living in cages that were not cleaned routinely, incidence was 23.8%. It was proposed that bacteria in fecal material split the urinary urea to form ammonia. It was theorized that the ammonia contacts the cornea and causes necrosis of the corneal epithelium, with resultant inflammation and vascularization of the stroma [28], [29]. This change eventually results in scarring and mineralization of the stroma with dysplasia of the overlying epithelium [29]. Very young mice may be more susceptible to these ammonia burns than are older mice because their eyes open before they are mobile enough to escape the high-ammonia concentrations at the bottom of the cage [29].",

These abnormally placed pupils usually dilate with mydriatics, but dilate less than the unaffected pupil. When the affected pupil is dilated, it typically assumes a keyhole shape. Although it is considered to be a common congenital abnormality, one study reported mice with iris colobomas that previously had been normal, raising the possibility of an inflammatory or infectious cause [34]. Histologic examination demonstrated mild infiltration of the iris and ciliary body with mononuclear inflammatory cells and occasional anterior or posterior synechiae.

Many different cataract mutations have been induced in mice and rats by irradiation or chemical mutagens to simulate mutations that are similar to those seen in human cataracts [38], [39]. Clinically and histologically, cataracts in mice and rats appear similar; however, a clear difference in the prevalence of spontaneous cataracts has been observed. In one laboratory, cataracts were shown to occur more commonly in mice than in rats, and some cases were found to be heritable [9]. Of all the mice examined at 18 months of age, 25% had some form of cataract. Rats had a prevalence of over 11% at 2 years of age. Complete cataracts were uncommon in both species, but were seen in some old Sprague-Dawley rats [9]. The pathogenesis of these spontaneous cataracts was not known. Cataracts are seen commonly in rats with retinal degeneration [40]. Lens opacities also can occur in rodents following prolonged eyelid separation, most commonly during anesthesia, and are believed to occur as a result of temperature or osmotic changes in the anterior chamber and in the lens [4]. These opacities are usually transient and resolve soon after recovery from anesthesia.",

When these remnants persist later into adult life, they may remain free-floating, may be associated with hemorrhage (which normally resolves completely), or may remain adherent to the posterior lens capsule [9], [42], [43].

Some strains of mice and rats may have heritable retinal degeneration, whereas other strains develop degeneration secondary to other causes. Phototoxic retinopathy is the most thoroughly investigated and common cause of secondary retinal degeneration in laboratory mice and rats and has been classified into two types by Noelle [44], [45]. Type I is caused by relatively brief exposure to bright light and results in damage to the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium. Type II is caused by long-term exposure to low-intensity illumination and primarily affects the photoreceptors [44], [45]. Even moderate- or low-intensity continuous illumination has been shown to result in severe retinal damage [46]. Predisposing factors to phototoxic retinopathy include age, concentration of certain hormones, degree of ocular melanosis, diet, genetic factors, duration and intensity of light, and intermittent versus continuous light exposure [44], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53]. Albino mice and rats are substantially more sensitive to the effects of light than are melanotic strains [51]. It would be unusual for this condition to occur in companion mice or rats that are exposed to the typical lighting conditions in home environments.",

The primary defect seems to be an impaired ability of the pigment epithelium to phagocytose and prevent the accumulation of rod outer-segment fragments. The degeneration develops more slowly in darkness, indicating that other environmental factors, such as light intensity, may affect the rate of progression [9], [47], [53], [54], [55]. Ophthalmic examination usually reveals pallor of the fundus [9], [42], and retinal vessels increasingly become attenuated with time, presumably secondary to the decreased metabolic demands of the degenerating retina [55]. Heritable retinal degeneration is a more widespread in mice than in rats. Because of the widespread occurrence of degeneration in laboratory mice, it is difficult to be certain whether true senile changes exist in mice [9].

Microphthalmia alone or accompanied by cataract or retinal dysplasia has occurred sporadically in rats and is believed to be possibly of genetic origin [1]. Microphthalmia can be confused with phthisis bulbi that results from previous trauma or severe uveitis [1]. Microphthalmia can range from subtle to substantial. Only a small remnant of the eye may be present, leading to the clinical misdiagnosis of anophthalmia [65]. Complete resorption of a malformed eye may occur [66]. In the development of microphthalmia and anophthalmia, the most critical time in mice is between optic vessicle development (day 8 of gestation) and fetal fissure clossure (day 12) [65]. Interruption of this process or faulty development of the tissues results in a deformed eye. Hypervitaminosis A has been reported to increase the frequency of these defects by interfering with neural crest migration into the facial primordium [65], [67]. This migration causes a number of anomalies, such as exophthalmia and open-eyelid anomalies [65], [67]. Breeding, housing factors, and toxic environmental factors have been shown to influence the occurrence of microphthalmia [68], [69].",
