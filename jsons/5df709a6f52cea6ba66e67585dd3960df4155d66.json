            "text": "An estimated 5% of the world's population are carriers for trait genes for haemoglobin disorders, mainly sickle cell disease. Over 75% of the global burden of sickle cell anaemia occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, and sickle cell disease is the most prevalent inherited genetic disease with 10-45% of the population carrying the sickle cell gene. Advances in sickle cell disease management, including screening of newborn babies, pneumococcal prophylaxis, and hydroxyurea therapy have transformed sickle cell disease from a fatal childhood disease to a chronic condition of adulthood. Sickle cell disease remains a neglected tropical disease in Africa, characterised by a scarcity of specialist services and resultant high mortality for children younger than 5 years. 1 Furthermore, few African countries have epidemiological data on disease burden, which poses an additional barrier to effective health systems planning. This situation is compounded by the additional burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on existing resources.",

            "text": "Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown different clinical courses across age groups. 4 Modelling of fatality in the early course of the outbreak from a preprint study showed case fatality ratios (CFR) increasing from 1\u00b73% for people aged 50-59 years to 9\u00b78% in those aged 70-79 years. 5 The increased CFR with older age has been attributed to increased comorbidities in these age groups, including pre-existing immunosuppression, diabetes, HIV, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular, liver, and renal conditions. That a very different epidemic pattern for COVID-19 will be seen in Africa is possible. The demographics of many sub-Saharan countries are heavily skewed towards younger populations, suggesting potential for a milder disease course than countries with a high proportion of older age groups; however, this might not always be the case, especially for countries with high burdens of pre-existing health conditions such as sickle cell disease. The ability of these often fragile health-care systems to manage COVID-19 has been discussed. 6 However, that many people younger than 50 years on the African continent live with potentially important comorbidities (eg, HIV, hypertension, and sickle cell disease), has not been discussed. 7 Acute respiratory illnesses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease who have an increased risk of asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease, including acute chest syndrome. COVID-19 pathology is associated with reduced cellular oxygenation, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases. This pathological process is closely linked to an increased risk of vaso-occlusive complications in sickle cell disease, including acute chest syndrome. Specific diagnostic, treatment, and logistical challenges exist in meeting the health-care needs of people with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Highrisk populations, including people with sickle cell disease, must be considered in the development of local preventative and health-care strategies. A crucial first step Arno Massee/Science Photo Library is to identify people who are at risk through screening. Uganda has shown that identifying people with sickle cell disease can be done with targeted screening; 10 however, these programmes need widespread adoption to identify the true numbers of people with sickle cell disease across the continent. Diagnostic and treatment resources should be rapidly scaled up in conjunction with investment in public health campaigns targeted to the at-risk sickle cell disease population. When an effective and affordable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, people with sickle cell disease should be prioritised for immunisation because of their increased risk of mortality. This immunisation should be aligned with routine pneumococcal vaccination, which has proven to be effective.",

Provision for sickle cell disease diagnosis and treatment should be incorporated into national health systems programming, with an emphasis on delivering sickle cell disease services in the primary care setting.
