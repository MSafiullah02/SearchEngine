ND and IB have been important and common chicken diseases worldwide since 1926 and 1936 respectively. In the last three decades, publications from both our and other laboratories have highlighted the importance of aMPV [1], which causes a drop in egg production and quality, and swollen head syndrome in chickens [5], [6]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) are respiratory RNA viruses that primarily infect the tracheal epithelium of chickens [7].",

Simultaneous vaccination with multiple live viral vaccines is carried out in poultry for a number of reasons. These include the avoidance of inducing stress in chicks through excessive handling, and to reduce vaccination costs [9]. Traditionally, NDV and single IBV Massachusetts live vaccines are given to day-old chicks at the hatchery or in the farms, mostly by spray. However, as the disease and losses caused by variant IBVs increase [10], [11], [12], growing numbers of producers have been including a 793B vaccine in the day-old vaccination programme. All three diseases (IBV, aMPV and NDV) are now routinely controlled in the poultry industry through the use of live attenuated vaccines [13], [14], with long lasting antibody titres recorded for inactivated NDV vaccinations [15].",

(2007) demonstrated how NDV immunity decreased when combined with an IBV Arkansas vaccine in broiler chickens [7]. With the introduction of aMPV in 1990\u2032s, the possibility of heterologous co-vaccination of NDV + aMPV and IBV + aMPV at day-old was investigated [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. These publications showed that simultaneous administration of aMPV vaccine alongside NDV or IBV vaccine were compatible, with protection against virulent IBV, NDV or aMPV remaining uncompromised. However, in these studies, only a single vaccine strain of IBV (Massachusetts) was used. With the emergence of variant IBVs, inclusion of a variant IBV alongside Massachusetts for day-old vaccination has become a common practice [19], [24], [25].",

No vaccine viruses were detected in the trachea at 5 dpc. However, both virulent challenge viruses were present, suggesting host clearance of IBV vaccines by at least 25 dpv [52], [53]. The co-administration of either NDV or aMPV alongside the IBV vaccine caused a lower IBV vaccine virus load in both the trachea and kidney at 21 dpv. However, post-challenge with virulent IBV, the combined IBV with NDV or aMPV vaccination had no effect on viral load when compared with IBV vaccination alone. For both experiments, despite relatively higher tracheal viral load, a low REU value was shown in kidney tissue from non-IBV vaccinated groups following M41 and QX challenge. These results, along with the cilia-stopping test, demonstrated that comparable levels of protection are found when IBV H120 and CR88 vaccine strains are given either alone or alongside an NDV or aMPV vaccine.",

Haemagluttination inhibition titres were traditionally used to confirm protection against NDV challenge [55], [56], and the mean NDV HI titre in both single and combined vaccinated groups described here were >5.63 log2, which is above the protective titre against virulent NDVs [19], [23], [57], [58]. Current work showed that simultaneous vaccination of NDV + H120 + CR88 in commercial broiler chicks does not interfere with the induction of protective immunity against NDV. In this study, following challenge with virulent aMPV, no clinical signs were found in the single (aMPV) or combined (aMPV + H120 + CR88) vaccinated groups, confirming clinical protection against the challenge virus [19], [23], [59]. Furthermore, following challenge with the virulent strain, no antigen was detected by RT-PCR from tissue samples in either of the vaccinated groups. The aMPV ELISA antibody titres in the triple-vaccinated group was lower than the single vaccinated group, echoing findings from previous work [23]. However, it has been reported that levels of humoral antibodies have no association with clinical protection against aMPV [60], [61]. It is evident that experimental vaccination of commercial broilers (with aMPV and IBV MDAs) with aMPV subtype B and two IBV strains (H120 and CR88) had no adverse effects on clinical protection conferred against a virulent challenge.",

For NDV and aMPV, classical RT-PCRs [32], [40] were applied to RNA extracted from oropharyngeal swabs, with no detection of the NDV vaccine at any sampling points. Previous work has shown detection of NDV vaccine virus in SPF chickens for up to four days post vaccination [19], [62]. In this experiment, first sampling was carried out at 7 dpv, and the failure to detect NDV may have been due to rapid clearance of the vaccine [19]. For aMPV, it was possible to detect the virus up to 7 dpv using dry oropharyngeal swabs and until 21 dpv from tracheal tissue. While Awad et al., (2015) identified the aMPV vaccine at 21 dpv in a combined IBV + aMPV vaccinated group [19], there was no difference between single and combined vaccinated groups in the current study, suggesting that combined vaccination does not impair a host\u2019s ability to rapidly clear the aMPV vaccine strain. IBV vaccinal strains have previously been shown to persist in chickens for a longer period [53], [63]. To further investigate this, the growth kinetics and genetic characteristics of live IBV vaccines used in this study were cross compared with previous reports [26], [64]. Vaccinal strains were detected in OP swabs throughout the current experiment, with the variant 793B strain dominating at the later ages of the birds. With both experiments, Sanger sequencing showed that the genotype of strains recovered using OP swabs altered from Mass to 793B after 14 dpv. As reported previously [26], [27], while the Mass genotype made up the majority of detections during early sampling days (3\u201314 dpv), the 793B strain became the dominant strain by 21 dpv. The reason for the shifting of genotypes from Mass to 793B is not known, however, previous work has highlighted that different IBV strains can differentially induce host expression pathways, in particular TLR7 [65] and IFN-\u03b2 [66]. Such differences may have played a role in a host\u2019s ability to clear the Mass vaccine virus at an earlier time point when compared to the 793B vaccine. Further work is required to understand potential underlying mechanisms.",

Limited genetic changes were noted in the tissues samples, with 3\u20134 and 4\u20137.5 SNPs per sequence in the Mass and 793B vaccine strains respectively. A higher number of polymorphisms were seen in the 793B sequences, compared to Massachusetts, indicating that the persistence of this particular genotype may contribute to greater genetic variations within local virus populations [64], [67], [68]. However, the ds/dns ratios suggest purifying selection for both genotypes [69], and therefore evolutionary constraint [70].
