Allergists/immunologists may need to modify 49 recommendations for the acute management of anaphylaxis during these unprecedented times to 50 ensure optimal outcomes of anaphylaxis while weighing the infectious risk and health care burdens 51 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. (1) The following recommendations reinforce and expand on 52 the recent expert opinion to assist allergists/immunologists in considering how to adjust their practice 53 under these unique circumstances. (1, 2) Decision-making will vary based on local contexts and 54 resources as rates of COVID-19 and access to healthcare differ geographically. Moreover, there will be 55 cases of severe anaphylaxis where we would not deviate from the usual plan of contacting emergency 56 services immediately after using epinephrine. (Figure 1 ) Patients should be empowered to activate 57 emergency medical services (EMS) if they feel concerns or feel urgent care is needed after epinephrine 58 use and EMS should be activated if severe symptoms do not completely resolve or if they recur. We 59 recommend utilizing telemedicine to proactively discuss the modified management of anaphylaxis and 60 communicate thresholds for activating EMS, per individual patient's profile, local COVID-19 burden and 61 careful assessment of risk to benefit ratio. 62",

Patients should 82 administer their epinephrine autoinjector as soon as there are symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. 83After the epinephrine autoinjector is used, patients should be monitored for response to treatment and 84 if severe symptoms resolve promptly (.e.g., wheezing, shortness of breathing, difficulty breathing, 85 vomiting, throat swelling, faintness, hypotension) they should notify their doctor on a non-urgent basis.86 If severe symptoms persist or worsen, a second dose of epinephrine should be injected, and if prompt 87 resolution of severe symptoms is not achieved, emergency services should be activated. If patients have 88 questions regarding subsequent management, they might attempt to contact their physician urgently 89 although during the COVID pandemic access might be limited. For patients with a prior history of severe 90 anaphylaxis, it might be prudent to proactively discuss the modified management of anaphylaxis, if 91 feasible, e.g., via telemedicine. There should be clear, open communication regarding the risk/benefit 92 assessment for ED evaluation, taking into account symptoms, prior history (i.e. asthma and anaphylaxis 93 history), access to EMS/ED if symptoms progress, patient/caregiver knowledge and comfort as well as 94 other factors that may influence decision-making. (6) It is also important to emphasize that the 95 recommendation for ED evaluation is based on the assessment of how likely there will be need for 96 additional medical intervention to manage anaphylaxis, and not because epinephrine is a dangerous 97 medication (this misconception should be dispelled). Telephone or telehealth video follow-up can be 98 helpful to address any questions that may arise regarding avoidance of anaphylaxis triggers and 99 management of future reactions. 100 101 Biphasic or prolonged anaphylaxis can occur. (9) Patients need to be educated about this possibility and 102 be ready to emergently manage a recurrence. If they have exhausted their supply of epinephrine 103 autoinjectors managing the initial symptoms and symptoms have resolved or improved significantly, 104 they should continue monitoring and obtain a refill of EAIs. If symptoms have persisted or escalated, 105 they should call 911 and seek immediate medical assistance. 106 107 Open communications with patients and families regarding risks and benefits of emergency department 108 evaluation after epinephrine administration for anaphylaxis are strongly encouraged. (6) Patients should 109understand that these modifications reflect a shift in risk/benefit assessment as infectious risks and 110 healthcare system burdens associated with emergency department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic 111 is significantly higher than usual. The successful implementation of home management of an acute 112 anaphylactic event requires patients to be calm, educated and in possession of medications needed to 113 treat an acute reaction. As with all anaphylactic reactions, the quicker epinephrine is administered the 114 less likely a reaction will progress to a catastrophic event.
