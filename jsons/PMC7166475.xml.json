Horiuchi et al\n9 analysed the volatile compounds obtained from fish oil heated with cysteine and/or TMAO and concluded that TMAO promoted the oxidative degradation of fish oil and that cysteine generated compounds contributing to cooked fish flavour.",

Each sample (200 g) was placed in a three\u2010necked separable 3 l round flask along with 200 ml of boiling water, then heated with refluxing for 30 min by a mantle heater. The fish broth (350 ml) obtained after filtering the boiled mixture through three layers of cotton gauze (Hakujuji Co, Tokyo, Japan) was divided into 35 ml aliquots in 50 ml glass vials. The headspace air in the vials was replaced by N2 gas, and the broth was stored at \u221250 \u00b0C to await sensory evaluation and aroma extraction and concentration. The broths were thawed by immersing the vials in water at 40 \u00b0C and used in the following steps. ",

Fish broth (35 ml) prepared from 20 g of fish was placed in a 260 ml disposable plastic cup, covered with a plastic petri dish and served to the panellists at 40 \u00b0C. Prior to quantitative descriptive analysis, panellists discussed the aroma properties of the samples during three preliminary sessions, each lasting 90 min, until they had agreed on their use as sensory attributes. Quantitative descriptive analysis was performed for the 10 attributes listed in Table 2, using a 15 cm line scale. In order to tune the scales used by each panellist for each attribute, panellists evaluated five representative samples from the 16 samples and discussed their results in respect of each attribute. For any attribute, if the score awarded by one or a few panellists differed from that of the majority, the minority was expected to accept the majority assessment, though this was not mandatory. Quantitative descriptive analysis was then performed on all the samples, divided randomly into four sessions involving three or four samples each. Each sample was coded with a three\u2010digit random number. In each session, samples were presented randomly to each panellist. All samples were evaluated once. ",

On the other hand, Josephson3 postulated that thermally processed fish flavours can be classified into at least five groups, namely saltwater whitefish, freshwater whitefish, tuna and mackerel, trout and char, and salmon. However, in our study, saltwater whitefish species were further separated into \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018sweet\u2019 aroma groups, and the aromas of tuna and mackerel were described differently. Although the saltwater and freshwater species investigated in this study were not differentiated clearly, all the freshwater species belonging to group 1 were characterised by a strong \u2018green\u2019 odour. Furthermore, group 1 was divided into two subgroups (group 1a: loach and eel; group 1b: snapper, carp, conger and pond smelt). Fish species belonging to group 1a had high scores only for \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018fishy\u2019, whereas those in group 1b showed high or moderate scores for other attributes as well. ",

Josephson et al\n12 compared 14 volatile compounds, including 6, 8 and 9\u2010carbon alcohols and carbonyls, in 12 freshwater and four saltwater fish species. They detected four common compounds in both groups, but 10 compounds were found only in freshwater species. In the dendrogram the distance between mackerel and banded blue\u2010sprat was small. Cod, flounder and goby made one cluster, while swordfish and sablefish made another. These classifications were partly similar to those based on the sensory data. Next, clustering of the 15 fish species on the basis of 69 peaks selected by PLSR (listed in Table 3) is shown in Fig 6(b). Group 1 (banded blue\u2010sprat and mackerel) and group 3 (swordfish, sablefish and salmon) each made one cluster, but clusters corresponding to groups 2 and 4 were not clearly observed. However, clustering based on the selected peaks looks more like the dendrogram formed by sensory data (Fig 3(a)) than that based on all the peaks. This similarity can be easily understood, because the 69 peaks were selected according to their high contributions to the sensory attributes by PLSR analysis. ",
