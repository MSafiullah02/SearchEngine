Thus, it was found that a naturally abundant furan compound, menthofuran, is readily cross-coupled with haloacetylenes under transition metal-free conditions in the solid Al2O3 powder at room temperature to give 2-ethynyl derivatives in up to 88% yield. In contrast to the ethynylation of pyrroles under similar conditions, the reaction studied involves reversible [4 + 2]-cycloaddition of the furan ring to form the isolable intermediated cycloadducts, which then further transform to the acetylenic derivatives.
