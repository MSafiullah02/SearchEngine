            "text": "Pulmonary disease is a highly prevalent cause of premature morbidity and mortality in long-term childhood cancer survivors. In the large-scale retrospective North American cohort, the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), Armstrong and colleagues reported signifi cant excess rates of death due to pulmonary disease (standard mortality ratio, 8.8) , second only to death from second malignant neoplasms [ 1 ] . Pulmonary toxicity is frequently reported in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, germ cell tumors, acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and metastatic Wilms tumor survivors, as the chemotherapy, radiation and surgeries used to treat these pediatric cancer (among others) can result in permanent lung damage [ 2 , 3 ] . This damage can manifest as acute pneumonitis, late onset fi brosis, and structurally induced dysfunction from developmental abnormalities due to impaired growth of the thorax attributable to surgery or radiation. The cumulative incidence of pulmonary problems after childhood cancer increases with time since diagnosis, as with other late-effects, suggesting that survivors are at an elevated risk of developing later-onset pulmonary morbidities as they age [ 4 ] .",

            "text": "The lungs are particularly sensitive to radiation. Pulmonary late effects occur most often in patients with malignant diseases of the chest that are treated with radiation, i.e., those involving the mediastinum, the lung parenchyma or the chest wall. These survivors typically include those treated with chest or mantle fi eld radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or sarcoma, and those whose primary disease metastasized to the lung (i.e., Wilms tumor). In one of the largest studies of pulmonary outcomes among adult childhood cancer survivors exposed to pulmonary toxic therapy, Mulder and colleagues demonstrated that radiation was the most important risk factor for pulmonary late effects [ 5 ] . In those exposed directly or indirectly to lung radiation, abnormal radiographic fi ndings or restrictive changes on pulmonary function testing have been reported in more than 30 % of patients. In addition to radiation dose and the volume of lung in the radiation fi eld, fractionation and younger age at therapy are risk factors for toxicity. [ 4 ] . Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis is a risk factor for long-term lung dysfunction as the acute changes associated with this condition often evolve to pulmonary fi brosis. Acute pneumonitis is usually only observed in patients who receive higher radiation doses (>30 Gy) to a signifi cant portion of their lungs and is an uncommon outcome with contemporary therapy [ 6 ] . In these high doses, radiation toxicity is characterized by acute radiation pneumonitis, occurring within 1-3 months after radiation. Cough, pink sputum, dyspnea and pleuritis are common complaints during this subacute pneumonitis phase. When pulmonary-toxic chemotherapy (i.e., busulfan or melphalan) is combined with total body irradiation (e.g., for stem cell transplantation conditioning), reactions can occur during treatment. As mentioned, the acute changes of radiation pneumonitis may result in the development of pulmonary fi brosis. This fi brotic phase of injury can start within 3-6 months of post radiation completion, stabilizes after 1-2 years but can present clinically years following treatment. When symptomatic, pulmonary fi brosis usually presents with exertional dyspnea as well as chronic, non-productive cough. These clinical changes may be progressive, static or resolve over time. However, it is important to note, the majority of chest RT survivors are clinically asymptomatic . And yet while asymptomatic, many of these survivors may demonstrate sub-clinical radiographic and pulmonary function testing abnormalities, including diffusion capacity or abnormal restrictive or obstructive patterns that are common even after lower radiation doses [ 7 ] .",

In a series of metastatic Wilms tumor survivors treated with whole lung irradiation (15 Gy in 10-14 daily fractions) combined with actinomycin, survivors had small lung volumes but normal gas transfer per unit lung volume when compared to predicted age and height reference ranges, suggesting that while lung RT results in chest wall underdevelopment, diffuse lung fi brosis is not signifi cant at this dose level.",

The majority of these studies indicate asymptomatic restrictive lung disease in up to 30-40 % of those survivors exposed to chest radiation. Bossi and colleagues described the pulmonary outcomes of 27 pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma survivors and found that exposure to less than 20 Gy of mediastinal radiation was not associated with an increased risk of lung dysfunction. However, in patients who received over 20 Gy of mediastinal radiation and higher cumulative doses of bleomycin, pulmonary diffusion capacity was impaired [ 15 ] . In a Danish population-based study of the pulmonary function of survivors of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 41), Nysom and colleagues found that at a median of 11 years after diagnosis, total lung capacity and the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were reduced in both radiated and non-radiated patients who had received chemotherapy. Survivors who were treated with radiation at a young age were particularly at risk [ 16 ] . These fi ndings have been confi rmed in studies that demonstrated that combined treatment with chest radiation and bleomycin for Hodgkin lymphoma increases the risk of a persistent decrease in diffusion capacity [ 17 , 18 ] .",

Antineoplastic drug-associated pulmonary damage may be the result of pneumonitis or fi brosis, hypersensitivity/allergy or idiosyncratic reactions. A dose-response toxicity has been demonstrated after treatment with bleomycin, chlorambucil or nitrosoureas. Damage mediated likely through an allergic effect, though very rare, is the result of methotrexate exposure. Bleomycin, an antibiotic chemotherapy agent frequently used in Hodgkin lymphoma and germ cell tumor protocols, is the most common chemotherapy agent associated with lung injury in childhood cancer survivors. Bleomycin can cause acute pneumonitis as well as chronic lung toxicity. Toxicity is more common in older adults than in children. Pathophysiologic studies of bleomycin attribute its pulmonary injury to free radical formation and oxidative damage. Fibrosis develops posttreatment due to immune processes that include activation of effector cells, including alveolar macrophages, and release of cytokines, with tumor necrosis factor potentially playing a role. Usually, pulmonary abnormalities occur within 3-12 months after exposure and persist or progress.",

In a cohort of 89 childhood cancer survivors post allogeneic HSCT, Inaba reported progressive worsening of pulmonary function as measured by forced midexpiratory fl ow (25-50 %), residual volume, total lung capacity (TLC), and DLCO. Obstructive lung disease is also observed in HSCT survivors. For example, Bruno reported that in a series of 80 children treated with allogeneic HSCT, mean FEV1/FVC values of less than 60 % of predicted were observed in patients whose chronic graft versus host disease persisted 5 years after transplant.",

Radiation exposure heightens the risk of pulmonary late effects when combined with surgical resection. In a Dutch cohort of childhood cancer survivors exposed to pulmonary toxic therapy, those with a history of surgical resection combined with radiation exposure had the highest increased risk of long-term pulmonary function impairment [ 5 ] .",

Chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing (including DLCO and spirometry) are recommended at entry into a long-term follow-up program and then as clinically indicated in patients with abnormal results or clinical symptoms (see Table 8 .1 ). Pneumococcal and infl uenza vaccination should be considered. Smoking exacerbates the risk for lung dysfunction, and all at-risk survivors should be counseled regarding the importance of smoking avoidance or cessation. Anecdotal reports of progressive pulmonary fi brosis after exposure to high oxygen concentration (e.g., during anesthesia) has prompted the recommendation that survivors treated with bleomycin avoid exposure to concentrated oxygen and wear a MedicAlert bracelet documenting their risk. As such, for all bleomycin-exposed survivors and for all survivors with symptomatic pulmonary toxicity or abnormal PFTs after exposure to other pulmonary toxic therapy, an anesthesia consult should be obtained prior to any surgical procedures. SCUBA diving is controversial for longterm survivors and those with risk factors for pulmonary late effects should obtain medical clearance from a pulmonologist prior to diving. Finally, any survivors that demonstrate clinical signs or symptoms of pulmonary dysfunction or abnormal imaging or pulmonary function testing, should be considered for referral to a pulmonologist.",
