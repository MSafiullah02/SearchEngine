The functional requirements of the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are an example of current functional requirement specifications (www.cdc.gov/phin). To our knowledge, no organization has published functional requirements derived from explicit consideration of timeliness requirements for specific diseases. System designers have been let off the hook, so to speak, by their customers for this\u2014arguably, the most difficult\u2014 requirement. The two published analyses that considered timeliness requirements were partial analyses: one analyzed gaps in current biosurveillance systems (Dato et al., 2001), and the second analyzed the data requirements for earlier detection (Wagner et al., 2001b).",

They concluded that the system specifications for a biosurveillance system capable of meeting the time requirement would include components to obtain and process data from biosensors, preclinical data sources (e.g., sales of cough syrup), and early clinical data (e.g., symptoms and radiological reports). A system would have to collect and analyze these data in near real time with attention to corroborating and discriminating data from other sources, such as wind patterns and physical location of individuals in the days preceding onset of illness. They concluded that conventionally trained physicians could not be relied on to detect an outbreak of this type. In the Sverdlovsk outbreak, the earliest suspicion of anthrax came from an autopsy finding of a cardinal's cap (hemorrhagic meningitis, a pathognomonic finding for the disease anthrax) on the eighth day after the release (Abramova et al., 1993), by which time 14 individuals had died (Guillemin, 2001). At least six victims had their early symptoms dismissed by physicians as not serious, and 21 individuals had died by the time that the laboratory confirmation of anthrax was broadcast to area hospitals on the 10th day after the accidental release (Guillemin, 2001).",

BDS attaches to mail-sorting machines. There is little doubt that the U.S. Postal Service designed this system with the functional requirement of early detection of an anthrax postal attack based on a careful postincident analysis of the 2001 postal attack. A mail-sorting machine is both a single point through which all mail passes (except locally routed rural mail and larger packages) and a nearly ideal device for expressing spores from all but the most tightly sealed envelops (because the sorting process compresses envelops), enabling the detection of spores by BDS.",

            "text": "An analysis by Wagner et al. (2003b) identified two additional anthrax attack scenarios: building/vessel contaminations and premonitory release. Specifically, a building or vessel contamination refers to the distribution of anthrax (or other agent) via the mechanical components in a building or ship. This is a serious threat because of our modern reliance on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, which can effectively disseminate spores throughout a building. The functional requirement for time of detection is similar to that of an outdoor release because many individuals would be exposed simultaneously. Recognition of a release contained within a structure, however, produces somewhat different requirements. Specifically, the requirement is the detection of a cluster of illnesses common to a relatively small number of individuals sharing a domicile, a place of employment, or a social facility. This detection requires recognition and analysis of these relationships. A detection system ideally would have access to data about heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, identity of occupants, and hours of occupation. The building contamination with B. anthracis of a postal facility in New Jersey during the 2001 postal attack is an interesting example for study (Greene et al., 2002). Tracing the illnesses to the specific building required the knowledge of work times, responsibilities, and routines for a large number of postal workers.",

The functional requirement here is one of sensitivity for single cases and small outbreaks, not extreme timeliness. To detect a single case, a biosurveillance system must have extremely high case detection sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic precision (or the prior probability must be extremely high, e.g., owing to intelligence information). A biosurveillance system would have to rely either on case detection by the healthcare system or on computer-based case detection. Computer-based case detection would have to be capable of diagnostic precision at least at the level of finding individuals with Gram-positive rods in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid and pneumonia on chest radiograph (which would be highly suggestive of anthrax). Examples of potential computer-based components include clinical information systems with decision support at the point of care, systems to monitor laboratory reporting of microbiology cultures; and free-text processing algorithms that scrutinize autopsy reports, newspaper stories, and obituaries for unusual deaths of animals or humans. If there are multiple cases, the demographics of the victims or the discovery of a geographic clustering of victims could help to identify a common cause with case detection at lower levels of diagnostic precision. In the absence of astute clinical diagnosis, it is likely that a single case of disease caused by a weaponized organism will progress to fatality. The requirements, therefore, include biosurveillance components (manual or automatic) that analyze unexplained deaths.",

In part, the designer's difficulty stems from the current lack of full understanding of the value of many of these types of data. The designer must weigh whether data can meet functional requirements for timeliness and accuracy of detection, the availability of the data, and the cost and efforts to acquire the data. Cost and effort may be dominant factors for data that either require effort on the part of many individuals or organizations to obtain the data, or data that are distributed among many computer systems, especially if the biosurveillance system will monitor at the national or international level.
