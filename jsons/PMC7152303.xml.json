Viral diseases in humans were first noted in ancient times and have since shaped our history. Scientific approaches to the study of viruses and viral disease began in the 19th century and led to the identification of specific disease entities caused by viruses. Careful clinical observations enabled the identification of many viral illnesses and allowed several viral diseases to be differentiated (e.g., smallpox vs. chickenpox and measles vs. rubella). Progress in an understanding of disease at the level of cells and tissues, exemplified by the pioneering work of Virchow, allowed the pathology of many viral diseases to be defined. Finally, the work of Pasteur ushered in the systematic use of laboratory animals for studies of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including those caused by viruses.",

These observations were quickly followed by the discovery of yellow fever virus and the seminal research on the pathogenesis of yellow fever by Walter Reed and the U. S. Army Yellow Fever Commission.1 By the end of the 1930s, tumor viruses, bacteriophages, influenza virus, mumps virus, and many arthropod-borne viruses had been identified. This process of discovery has continued with growing momentum to the present, with recently identified skin cancer\u2013associated Merkel cell polyomavirus,2 novel Old World arenaviruses causing fatal disease,3, 4 bat-related respiratory coronavirus5 and reoviruses,6, 7 and novel swine- and avian-origin influenza viruses8, 9 counted among the most recent entries in the catalog of human disease-causing viruses.",

General features of virus structure can be gained from examination of electron micrographs of negatively stained virions and thin-section electron micrographs of virus-infected tissues and cultured cells. These techniques allow rapid identification of viral size, shape, symmetry, and surface features, presence or absence of an envelope, and intracellular site of viral assembly. Cryoelectron microscopy and computer image processing techniques are used to determine the three-dimensional structures of spherical viruses at a level of resolution far superior to that of negatively stained electron micrographs. A major advantage of cryoelectron microscopy is that it allows structural studies of viruses to be performed under conditions that do not alter native virion structure. Moreover, recent advances in cryoelectron microscopy have extended the achievable resolution of particle-associated proteins to near-atomic levels, sufficient to recognize characteristic features of secondary structural elements.17 Image reconstructions of cryoelectron micrographs, sometimes in combination with x-ray crystallography, can also be used to investigate structural aspects of various virus functions, including receptor binding18, 19, 20 and interaction with antibodies.21, 22 Identification of key motifs, such as receptor binding sites or immunodominant domains, provides the framework for understanding the structural basis of virus\u2013cell interactions. Electron tomography with image reconstruction has been applied to architectural studies of viruses and intracellular foci of virus replication, rendering exquisite three-dimensional representations of particle organization and revealing the structure and subcellular origins of virus manufacturing centers.23, 24\n",

The parsimonious use of structural proteins in a repetitive motif minimizes the amount of genetic information required to encode the viral capsid and leads to structural arrangements with symmetrical features. All but the most complex viruses exhibit either helical or icosahedral symmetry (see Table 134-1). Viruses with helical symmetry contain repeating protein subunits bound at regular intervals along a spiral formed by the viral nucleic acid. Interestingly, all known animal viruses that show this type of symmetry have RNA genomes. Viruses with icosahedral symmetry display twofold, threefold, and fivefold axes of rotational symmetry, and viral nucleic acid is intimately associated with specific capsid proteins in an ordered packing arrangement.",

In the case of viruses with helical symmetry, there may be an initiation site on the nucleic acid to which the initial capsid protein subunit binds, triggering the addition of subsequent subunits. The genomes of most DNA-containing viruses are inserted into preassembled capsid intermediates (procapsids) through adenosine triphosphate\u2013driven mechanisms.27 In preparations of many icosahedral viruses, empty capsids (i.e., capsids lacking nucleic acid) are frequently observed, indicating that assembly may proceed to completion without a requirement for the viral genome.",

These viral proteins usually contain a glycosylated hydrophilic external portion and internal hydrophobic domains that span the lipid membrane and anchor the protein into the viral envelope. In some cases, another viral protein, often termed a matrix protein, associates with the internal (cytoplasmic) surface of the lipid envelope, where it can interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the envelope glycoproteins. Matrix proteins may play roles in stabilizing the interaction between viral glycoproteins and the lipid envelope, directing the viral genome to intracellular sites of viral assembly, or facilitating viral budding. Matrix proteins can also influence a diverse set of cellular functions, such as inhibition of host cell transcription28, 29 and evasion of the cellular innate antiviral response.30\n",

            "text": "One of the most dynamic areas of virology concerns the identification of virus receptors on host cells. This interest stems in part from the critical importance of the attachment step as a determinant of target cell selection by many viruses. Several virus receptors have now been identified (Table 134-2\n), and three important principles have emerged from studies of these receptors. First, viruses have adapted to use cell surface molecules designed to facilitate a variety of normal cellular functions. Virus receptors may be highly specialized proteins with limited tissue distribution, such as complement receptors, growth factor receptors, or neurotransmitter receptors, or more ubiquitous components of cellular membranes, such as integrins and other intercellular adhesion molecules, glycosaminoglycans, or sialic acid\u2013containing oligosaccharides. Second, many viruses use more than a single receptor to mediate multistep attachment and internalization. For example, adenovirus binds coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR)43 and the integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b1v\u03b25\n44; herpes simplex virus (HSV) binds heparan sulfate45, 46, 47 and herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM/HveA),48 nectin 1 (PRR1/HveC),49 or nectin 2 (PRR2/HveB)50; HIV binds CD451, 52 and chemokine receptors CXCR453, 54 or CCR555, 56, 57; and reovirus binds sialylated glycans58, 59 and JAM-A.60, 61 Third, in many cases, receptor expression is not the sole determinant of viral tropism for particular cells and tissues in the host. Therefore, although receptor binding is the first step in the interaction between virus and cell, subsequent events in the viral replication cycle must also be supported for productive viral infection to occur.",

In this regard, interactions of coxsackievirus with decay-accelerating factor elicit a tyrosine kinase\u2013based signaling cascade that mediates subsequent interactions of the virus with CAR in tight junctions.69 Structures of viral proteins or whole viral particles in complex with sialic acid have been determined for some viruses, including the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)36, 70 (see Fig. 134-3), polyomavirus,71, 72, 73, 74 foot-and-mouth disease virus,75 reovirus attachment protein \u03c31,58, 59 and the VP8 domain of rotavirus capsid protein VP4.34 Sialic acid binding in each of these cases occurs in a shallow groove at the surface of the viral protein. However, the architectures of the binding sites differ. Structures of complexes of viral proteins or viral particles and cell surface protein receptors have also been determined. These include adenovirus fiber knob and CAR,76 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp42 and major histo\u00adcompatibility complex (MHC) class II protein,77 HSV glycoprotein D and HVEM/HveA,78 HIV gp120 and CD4,38 measles virus HA and CD4679 and SLAM (signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule),80 reovirus \u03c31 and JAM-A,61 and rhinovirus and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1).81 In several of these cases, the viral attachment proteins engage precisely the same domains used by their cognate receptors to bind natural ligands.",

Hence, as a rule, viral replication is a localized process, occurring within morphologically discrete cytoplasmic or nuclear structures variously termed viral inclusions (or inclusion bodies), virosomes, viral factories, or viroplasm. These entities are novel, metabolically active organelles formed by contributions from both virus and cell.

In some cases, apoptosis may serve as an antiviral defense mechanism to limit viral replication by destruction of virus-infected cells or reduction of potentially harmful inflammatory responses elicited by viral infection.139 In other cases, apoptosis may result from viral induction of cellular factors required for efficient viral replication.136, 137 Generally, RNA-containing viruses, including influenza virus, measles virus, poliovirus, reovirus, and Sindbis virus, induce apoptosis of host cells, whereas DNA-containing viruses, including adenovirus, CMV, EBV, HPV, and the poxviruses, encode proteins that block apoptosis. For some viruses, the duration of the viral infectious cycle may determine whether apoptosis is induced or inhibited. Viruses capable of completing an infectious cycle before induction of apoptosis would not require a means to inhibit this cellular response to viral infection. Interestingly, several viruses that cause encephalitis are capable of inducing apoptosis of infected neurons (Fig. 134-5\n).140, 141, 142\n",

Steps involved in the replication of the viral genome are also obvious targets for antiviral therapy. A number of antiviral agents inhibit viral polymerases, including those active against herpesviruses (e.g., acyclovir), HIV (e.g., zidovudine), and HBV (e.g., entecavir). Drugs that inhibit viral proteases have been developed; several are used to treat HCV143, 144 and HIV145 infection. These drugs block the proteolytic processing of viral precursor polyproteins and serve as potent inhibitors of replication. Other viral enzymes also serve as targets for antiviral therapy. The influenza virus neuraminidase is required for the release of progeny influenza virus particles from infected cells. Oseltamivir and zanamivir bind the neuraminidase catalytic site and efficiently inhibit the enzyme.146 These drugs have been used in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infection.147\n",

A simple cough can generate up to 10,000 small, potentially infectious aerosol particles, and a sneeze can produce nearly 2 million. The distribution of these particles depends on a variety of environmental factors, the most important of which are temperature, humidity, and air currents. In addition to these factors, particle size is an important determinant of particle distribution. In general, smaller particles remain airborne longer than larger ones. Particle size also contributes to particle fate after inhalation. Larger particles (>6 \u00b5m) are generally trapped in the nasal turbinates, whereas smaller particles may ultimately travel to the alveolar spaces of the lower respiratory tract.",

Food, water, or hands contaminated by infected fecal material can facilitate the entry of a virus via the mouth into the gastrointestinal tract, the environment of which requires viruses that infect by this route to have certain physical properties. Viruses capable of enteric transmission must be acid stable and resistant to bile salts. Because conditions in the stomach and intestine are destructive to lipids contained in viral envelopes, most viruses that spread by the fecal-oral route are nonenveloped. Interestingly, many viruses that enter the host via the gastrointestinal tract require proteolysis of certain capsid components to infect intestinal cells productively. Treatment of mice with inhibitors of intestinal proteases blocks infection by reovirus155 and rotavirus,156 which demonstrates the critical importance of proteolysis in the initiation of enteric infection by these viruses. The host microbiota is essential for infection by some viruses.157, 158\n",

Studies with reovirus illustrate one strategy used by viruses to cross mucosal surfaces to invade the host after entry into the gastrointestinal tract.159, 160 After oral inoculation of mice, reovirus adheres to the surface of intestinal microfold cells (M cells) that overlie collections of intestinal lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches). In electron micrographs, reovirus virions can be followed sequentially as they are transported within vesicles from the luminal to the subluminal surface of M cells. Virions subsequently appear within Peyer's patches and then spread to regional lymph nodes and extraintestinal lymphoid organs such as the spleen. A similar pathway of spread has been described for poliovirus161 and HIV,162 suggesting that M cells represent an important portal for viral invasion of the host after entry into the gastrointestinal tract.",

Classic examples of localized infections in which viral entry and replication occur at the same anatomic site include respiratory infections caused by influenza virus, RSV, and rhinovirus; enteric infections produced by norovirus and rotavirus; and dermatologic infections caused by HPV (warts) and paravaccinia virus (milker's nodules). Other viruses spread to distant sites in the host after primary replication at sites of entry. For example, poliovirus spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system (CNS) to produce meningitis, encephalitis, or poliomyelitis. Measles virus and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) enter the host through the respiratory tract and then spread to lymph nodes, skin, and viscera. Pathobiologic definitions of viruses based on spread potential have begun to blur amid accumulating evidence that model agents of localized infection may disseminate to distant sites. For example, rotavirus, an important cause of pediatric acute gastroenteritis, replicates vigorously in villous tip epithelial cells of the small intestine but is also frequently associated with viral antigen and RNA in blood, the clinical significance of which is unclear.163 Influenza virus is another case in point; viral RNA in blood is detected at a substantial frequency in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and correlates with more severe disease and increased mortality.164\n",

For many viruses, tropism is determined by the availability of virus receptors on the surface of a host cell. This concept was first appreciated in studies of poliovirus when it was recognized that the capacity of the virus to infect specific tissues paralleled its capacity to bind homogenates of the susceptible tissues in vitro.182 The importance of receptor expression as a determinant of poliovirus tropism was conclusively demonstrated by showing that cells not susceptible for poliovirus replication could be made susceptible by recombinant expression of the poliovirus receptor.183 In addition to the availability of virus receptors, tropism can also be determined by postattachment steps in viral replication, such as the regulation of viral gene expression. For example, some viruses contain genetic elements, termed enhancers, that act to stimulate transcription of viral genes.184, 185 Some enhancers are active in virtually all types of cells, whereas others show exquisite tissue specificity. The promoter-enhancer region of John Cunningham (JC) polyomavirus is active in cultured human glial cells but not in HeLa cervical epithelial cells.186 Cell-specific expression of the JC virus genome correlates well with the capacity of this virus in immunocompromised persons to produce progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a disease in which JC virus infection is limited to oligodendroglia in the CNS.",

For example, EBV encodes several latency-associated proteins that are responsible for immortalization of B cells; these proteins likely play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of EBV-associated malignancies.220 Similarly, HPV encodes the E6 and E7 proteins that block apoptosis112, 113, 114 and induce cell cycle progression,110, 111 respectively. It is hypothesized that unregulated expression of these proteins induced by the aberrant integration of the HPV genome into host DNA is responsible for malignant transformation.221 The tumorigenicity of polyomaviruses, which are oncogenic in rodent species, is mediated by a family of viral proteins known as tumor (T) antigens. Reminiscent of the HPV E6 and E7 proteins, T antigens induce cell cycling and block the ensuing cellular apoptotic response to unscheduled cell division.222 The normally episomal polyomavirus genome becomes integrated into cellular DNA during neoplastic transformation of nonpermissive cells unable to support the entire viral replication program, which would otherwise culminate in cell death. Discovery of a human polyomavirus clonally integrated into cells of an aggressive form of skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma,2 substantiates the long-standing suspicion that polyomaviruses can also promote neoplasia in humans.",

            "text": "The immune response to viral infection involves complex interactions among leukocytes, nonhematopoietic cells, signaling proteins, soluble proinflammatory mediators, antigen-presenting molecules, and antibodies. These cells and molecules collaborate in a highly regulated fashion to limit viral replication and dissemination through recognition of broadly conserved molecular signatures, followed by virus-specific adaptive responses that further control infection and establish antigen-selective immunologic memory. The innate antiviral response is a local, transient, antigen-independent perimeter defense strategically focused at the site of virus incursion into an organ or tissue. Mediated by ancient families of membrane-associated and cytosolic molecules known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the innate immune system detects pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are fundamental structural components of microbial products including nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.234 Viral PAMPs in the form of single-stranded (ss)RNA, dsRNA, and DNA evoke the innate immune response through two groups of PRRs: the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the cytosolic nucleic acid sensors. The latter include retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat containing proteins (NLRs) such as NLRP, and DNA sensors.235 Nucleic acid binding by PRRs activates signaling pathways leading to the production and extracellular release of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 engage the cell surface IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor and thereby mediate expression of hundreds of gene products that corporately suppress viral replication and establish an intracellular antiviral state in neighboring uninfected cells. Well-described IFN-inducible gene products include the latent enzymes dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), both of which are activated by dsRNA.236 PKR inhibits the initiation of protein synthesis through phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1. The 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoandenylates generated by OAS bind and activate endoribonuclease RNAse L, which degrades viral mRNA. In addition to mediating an intracellular antiviral state, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 also stimulates the antigen-independent destruction of virus-infected cells by a specialized population of lymphocytes known as natural killer (NK) cells.237 Importantly, IFNs bridge innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses through multiple modes of action, which include enhancing viral antigen presentation by class I MHC proteins,238 promoting the proliferation of MHC class I\u2013restricted CD8+ CTLs,239 and facilitating the functional maturation of dendritic cells.240 Proinflammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 pleiotropically stimulate and amplify the innate immune response through induction of other inflammatory mediators, immune cell activation, and migration of inflammatory cells into sites of infection.241 These molecules perform essential functions in host antiviral defense.242\n",

Having both regulatory and effector roles, T lymphocytes are centrally positioned in the scheme of adaptive immunity. The primary cell type involved in the resolution of acute viral infection is the CD8+ CTL, which induces lethal proapoptotic signaling in virus-infected cells upon recognition of endogenously produced viral protein fragments presented by cell surface MHC class I molecules. Less frequently, CD4+ T cells, which recognize MHC class II\u2013associated viral oligopeptides processed from exogenously acquired proteins, also demonstrate cytotoxicity against viral antigen-presenting cells.243 The usual function of CD4+ T lym\u00adphocytes is to orchestrate and balance cell-mediated (CTL) and humoral (B lymphocyte) responses to infection. Classes of CD4+ helper T-cell subsets\u2014Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg (regulatory T), and Tfh (follicular helper T)\u2014have been defined based on characteristic patterns of cytokine secretion and effector activities.244, 245 Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes are usually associated with the development of cell-mediated and humoral responses, respectively, to viral infection. Th17 and Treg CD4+ subsets are important for control of immune responses and prevention of autoimmunity, but their precise roles in viral disease and antiviral immunity are not clear. For certain persistent viral infections, such as those caused by HIV and HSV, Treg cells might exacerbate disease through suppression of CTLs or, paradoxically, ameliorate illness by attenuating immune-mediated cell and tissue injury.246 Tfh cells promote differentiation of antigen-specific memory B lymphocytes and plasma cells within germinal centers.247 Therefore, Tfh cells likely occupy a central place in the humoral response to viral infection and vaccination. Although Tfh cell functions are not unique to antiviral responses, chronic viral infections including HBV and HIV appear to stimulate proliferation of these cells.248, 249 The Tfh phenotype may interconvert with other T-helper lineage profiles and thus represent a differentiation intermediate rather than a unique CD4+ T lymphocyte subset.245\n",

            "text": "The primacy of cell-mediated immune responses in combating viral infections is revealed by the extreme vulnerability of individuals to chronic and life-threatening viral diseases when cellular immunity is dysfunctional. Those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) exemplify the catastrophic consequences of collapsing cell-mediated immunity; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy caused by JC polyomavirus, along with severe mucocutaneous and disseminated CMV, HSV, and VZV infections, are frequent complications of vanishing CD4+ T cells. Similarly, iatrogenic cellular immunodeficiency associated with hematopoietic stem cell and solid-organ transplantation or antineoplastic treatment regimens predisposes to severe, potentially fatal infections with herpesviruses and respiratory viral pathogens such as adenovirus, PIV, and RSV,250 all of which normally produce self-limited illness in immunocompetent hosts. Prevention and management of serious viral respiratory infections are significant challenges in myelosuppression units because of the communicability of respiratory viruses and paucity of effective drugs to combat these ubiquitous agents. Individuals with significantly impaired cell-mediated immunity are also at increased risk for enhanced viral replication and systemic disease following immunization with live, attenuated viral vaccines (e.g., measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] and VZV vaccines). Hence, live viral vaccines are generally contraindicated for immunocompromised persons (see Chapter 321). TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor therapy, increasingly employed to manage a variety of rheumatologic and inflammatory diseases, enhances the risk of HBV reactivation with potentially life-threatening consequences.251 Preventive and interventional HBV treatment strategies are necessary to circumvent complications of uncontrolled viral replication in these patients.",

            "text": "In contrast to cell-mediated immune mechanisms, humoral responses are usually not a determinative factor in the resolution of primary viral infections. (One notable exception is a syndrome of chronic enteroviral meningitis in the setting of agammaglobulinemia.252) However, for most human viral pathogens, the presence of antibody is associated with protection against initial infection in vaccinees or reinfection in hosts with a history of natural infection.253 Longitudinal studies indicate that levels of protective serum antibodies (induced by natural infection or immunization) to common viruses, including EBV, measles, mumps, and rubella, are remarkably stable, with calculated antibody half-lives ranging from several decades to thousands of years.254 The protective role of antibodies on secondary exposure is frequently explained as interruption of viremic spread where a hematogenous phase is involved, such as occurs with measles, mumps, and rubella viruses, poliovirus, VZV, and most arboviruses. Nevertheless, most human viruses, excluding insect-transmitted agents, enter their hosts by transgression of a mucosal barrier, frequently undergoing primary replication in mucosal epithelium or adjacent lymphoid tissues. Neutralizing IgA exuded onto mucosal epithelial surfaces may protect against primary infection at this portal of viral entry. A classic example is gut mucosal immunity induced by orally administered Sabin poliovirus vaccine containing live-attenuated virus. Secretory IgA against poliovirus blocks infection at the site of primary replication and consequently interrupts the chain of viral transmission, although fully virulent revertant viruses arise at regular frequency in vaccine recipients, who may develop disease and also transmit revertant strains to nonimmune individuals.255 Clinical and experimental studies of immunity to HIV have led to the recognition that resident immune responses at exposed mucosal surfaces are likely critical components of host resistance to primary HIV infection, and achievement of potent mucosal immunity has emerged as an important consideration for the design of candidate HIV vaccines.256 Despite the appearance of serum neutralizing antibodies to HIV several weeks after infection, viral eradication is thwarted by selection of neutralization-resistant variant strains from a mutant pool, which is perpetually replenished because of extreme plasticity within neutralization determinants on the viral envelope glycoproteins.257 Identification of epitopes bound by broadly neutralizing antiviral antibodies has provided potential new targets for structure-based vaccine design.258\n",

            "text": "Protection against viral infection by serum immunoglobulins is often correlated with antibody-mediated neutralization of viral infectivity in cultured cells. Antibodies interrupt the viral life cycle at early steps, which may include cross-linking virion particles into noninfectious aggregates, steric hindrance of receptor engagement, and interference with viral disassembly.259 It is presumed that virus neutralization in cell culture by human serum is reflective of antibody activity in the intact host, but the mechanistic basis of infection blockade and disease prevention by antibodies in vivo is difficult to define precisely. For example, exclusively in vivo functions of the humoral antiviral response include Fc-mediated virion phagocytosis260, 261 and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC responses require effectors from both the innate and adaptive systems, NK cells and antibodies, respectively.262 The basis of ADCC is Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor-dependent recognition by NK cells of virus-specific IgG bound to antigens expressed on the surface of infected cells, leading to release of perforin and granzymes from NK cells that eventuate in target cell apoptosis. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages also possess Fc receptors and may participate in ADCC.",
