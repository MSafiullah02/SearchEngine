Copaiba is widely used in the traditional medicine in Brazil and other Latin American countries for treatment of various diseases, such as skin and urinary tract infections, respiratory diseases, ulcers, rheumatism, herpes, tumours and tetanus disease (Ohsaki et al. 1994). Due to its antibacterial, antihelminthic, trypanocidal and leishmanicidal applications, the oleoresin represents an important natural remedy for people without access to modern medicine and commercial drugs (Ohsaki et al. 1994; Leandro et al. 2012).",

Sesquiterpenes represent the main compounds that can count up to 98% of the oleoresin by weight, and show a rather stable metabolite pattern, with \u03b2-caryophyllene being the major constituent in most Copaifera species (Leandro et al. 2012). However, \u03b2-bisabolene has been identified as the major sesquiterpene of Copaifera reticulata Ducke collected in the Par\u00e1 region (northern Brazil) (Pfeifer Barbosa et al. 2019). In contrast to the sesquiterpenes, copaiba diterpenoids show much higher interspecific variation and therefore attracted particular interest in recent years due to varying biological activities observed for the different Copaifera species (Leandro et al. 2012). These activities comprise cytotoxic, antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal properties as part of numerous in vitro and in vivo studies attempting to attribute the detected effect to certain compounds or compound classes.",

The only exception is kolavenol, which showed antitumour effects against IMC carcinoma in mice, determined by an increase of life span of the animals (Ohsaki et al. 1994). In contrast, the main sesquiterpenes showed selective moderate (\u03b2-bisabolol) to pronounced (\u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b2-caryophyllene oxide) cytotoxic activities (Kubo et al. 1996; Yeo et al. 2016). With respect to their higher concentration in the oleoresin, it is more likely that sesquiterpenes are responsible for the antitumour properties of copaiba (Pfeifer Barbosa et al. 2019).",

In the same study, antidermatophytic activity against two Trichopyhton species was detected for (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1), the major diterpenoid in the Copaifera reticulata oleoresin, along with weak [(\u2212)-polyalthic acid, 1] to moderate (kaurenoic acid, 2) cytotoxic effects against six cancer cell lines. These findings prompted us to prepare semi-synthetic derivatives of both compounds in an attempt to enhance their antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties and to get more insights into their structure-activity-relationships (SAR).

The side chain at C-10 of lambertianic acid is \u03b2-oriented leading to \u03b1-oriented hydroxylation at position C-8, due to steric hindrance by the furanoethyl group. In contrast, (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) shows an \u03b1-oriented side chain at C-10; hence, the resulting hydroxy group at position C-8 had to have \u03b2-orientation and the hydroxymethylene group \u03b1-orientation instead. The \u03b1-orientation of the hydroxymethylene group was confirmed using NOESY, where NOE correlations were observed for the protons at C-17 on both the methylene group at C-11 and the C-20 methyl group.

As the absolute configuration has not been determined yet, (\u2212)-polyalthic acid is correctly described as (rel-1S,4aS,5R,8aS)-5-[2-(furan-3-yl)ethyl]-1,4a-dimethyl-6-methylene-decahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid. Daniellic acid was isolated from Daniellia oliveri (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) (Haeuser and Ourisson 1961), whereas (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) was obtained from Polyalthia fragrans (Annonaceae) and named polyalthic acid (Gopinath et al. 1961). Both compounds were attributed to possess the \u201cwrong\u201d configuration corresponding to an ent-labdane scaffold and showing negative optical rotation values. Both compounds are epimers, only differing in the orientation of the carboxyl group at position C-4, which is axial for daniellic acid and equatorial for (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1). Five years later, the first report for lambertianic acid, isolated from Pinus lambertiana (Pinaceae), was made (Dauben and Dauben and German 1965). Lambertianic acid was found to be the optical antipode of daniellic acid and thus to be the first furan diterpene with the so-called normal labdane configuration. The last of the four isomers was the optical antipode of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1), isolated from Sequoia semperivirens, Taxodiaceae (Ohta and Nawamaki 1978). However, instead of choosing an original trivial name (e.g. semperiviric acid), the authors named the compound (+)-polyalthic acid, being (rel-1R,4aR,5S,8aR)-5-[2-(furan-3-yl)ethyl]-1,4a-dimethyl-6-methylene-decahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid. Thus, from then onwards, two forms of polyalthic acid existed in the literature. Except for the last 3 years, where (+)- and (\u2212)- or ent- prefixes were used to differentiate between the two enantiomers (Bardaj\u00ed et al. 2016; Borges et al. 2016; Carneiro et al. 2018; \u00c7i\u00e7ek et al. 2018; Pfeifer Barbosa et al. 2019; Senedese et al. 2019), only one publication in almost four decades adopted such prefixes (Miyazawa et al. 1995). The missing stereochemistry did not represent a problem as long as the studies were dealing with Copaifera, because the ent-configuration is abundant in this genus (Leandro et al. 2012). However, some studies investigated plant species from other plant families; wherefore, the identity of the right enantiomer remained unknown. Thus, reporting the right configuration for polyalthic acid is absolutely necessary.",

            "text": "Another problem is that the introduction of (+)-polyalthic acid and the recent use of the ent-prefix for differentiation of the enantiomers seems to have caused confusions in some large databases, such as SciFinder\u2122 or Reaxys\u2122. For example, when searching for structure templates of polyalthic acid in the Reaxys database, three suggestions are delivered, of which two display (\u2212)-polyalthic acid and the other one shows (+)-polyalthic acid. However, by using the name ent-polyalthic acid, also two structures are displayed, one for (\u2212)-polyalthic acid and the second one for daniellic acid. For both compounds their semisystematic names are given along with twelve references per compound, thus giving equal priority to the correct and the incorrect structure. By looking for chemical structures in the SciFinder database, the name polyalthic acid leads to the structure of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid, which is historically correct, whereas the search for ent-polyalthic acid gives the structure of daniellic acid and thus the wrong compound. Alas, these inconsistencies or confusions, respectively, led to several publications showing the structure of daniellic acid instead of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (Leandro et al. 2012, \u00c7i\u00e7ek et al. 2018, Da Silva et al. 2017; Pfeifer Barbosa et al. 2019). The mentioned problems can be partly dealt with by using the prefixes of the respective optical rotations, leading to the exact structures for both (+)- and (\u2212)-polyalthic acid in the Reaxys database and also to the correct structure for (+)-polyalthic acid with the SciFinder database. Only the name (\u2212)-polyalthic acid does not yield any results with SciFinder, but as the name polyalthic acid leads to the structure of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid and the optical rotation can be retrieved from the experimental details, at least no misinformation is spread. We therefore suggest to use the prefix for the optical rotation only.",

Thus, the effect of derivatising either the carboxyl group or the exocyclic methylene group was the main aim of the present study. In a first screening at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml no effects for derivatives without the exocyclic methylene group (1c and 2c\u20132e) were observed (Table S1). Compounds 2d and 2e were earlier tested on four different cancer cell lines (K562, HL-60, MDA-MB435 and SF295) as well as on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells and compared with kaurenoic acid (Cavalcanti et al. 2009). Also here, the cytotoxic effect disappeared after derivatisation; wherefore, the authors hypothesised that the exocyclic methylene group is crucial for the cytotoxic effect.",

However, at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml, activity of compounds 1 and 2 as well as their derivatives against the additionally investigated organisms was rather low or non-existent in contrast to the already known effects against E. faecium and MRSA. But also against the latter two strains derivatisations did not lead to an improved activity (Table 2). Here, only compound 2c showed (at least moderate) effects, with IC50 values of 59.7 \u03bcg/ml against E. faecium and 34.7 \u03bcg/ml against MRSA. In contrast, (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) and kaurenoic acid (2) showed IC50 values of 8.5 and 2.3 \u03bcg/ml against E. faecium as well as 8.9 and 3.4 \u03bcg/ml against MRSA, respectively.
