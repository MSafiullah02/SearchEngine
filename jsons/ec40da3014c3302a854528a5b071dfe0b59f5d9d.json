The values which form the basis of the new guidelines are: 'spirit and integrity, reciprocity, respect, equality, survival and protection', and 'responsibility'. 24 An important issue for us was how best to conduct a demanding study as a true partnership with local communities, ensure optimal data collection related to multiple risk factors, including the collection of biological specimens, and maintain an acceptable level of follow-up.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 197, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 198, "end": 200, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 602, "end": 604, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 762, "end": 764, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 971, "end": 973, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1168, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1516, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ethical considerations"}, {"text": "This study aimed to: (1) identify important, avoidable risk factors for OM in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in the Kalgoorlie-Boulder area of Western Australia, and (2) to understand how these risk factors arise and interact in the complex causal pathways in order to develop effective intervention strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Aims"}, {"text": "In this paper we give an overview of methods used in the study and describe the socio-economic, environmental and demographic characteristics of the study population.
