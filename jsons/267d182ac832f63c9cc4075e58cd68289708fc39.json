            "text": "Infectious disease interventions like contact precautions and vaccination have proven effective in disease 7 control and elimination. The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen 8 is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively 9 to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing 10 natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the 11 influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple 12 a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain 13 with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective 14 behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of 15 the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane 16 analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against 17 them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour 18 enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain 19 has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing 20 the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our 21 results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour 22 in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts 23 to control infectious diseases. 24 1 2 Introduction 25 Modern approaches to developing a theory of the spread of infectious diseases can be traced to 1927 when 26 Kermack and McKendrick developed an integro-differential equation model now widely described as the SIR 27 (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model [1]. The model tracks changes in the number of individuals suscep-28 tible to an infection S(t), the number of infected individuals I(t), and (implicitly) the number of recovered 29 individuals R(t). Compartmental models such as the SIR model are useful for mechanistic modelling of 30 infection transmission in populations. They have since been further developed to study the evolution and 31 epidemiology of multiple species of pathogens in a population or different strains of the same species [2].",

            "text": "Compartmental models have also been used to study the phenomenon of pathogen virulence-the rate 38 at which a pathogen induces host mortality and/or reduces host fecundity [9, 10, 11, 12]. It was initially 39 believed that hosts and parasites co-evolved to a state of commensalism (whereby parasites benefit from 40 their host without harming them) [13, 14] but this hypothesis was later challenged [15]. In mathematical 41 models, virulence is often treated as a fixed model parameter expressing the excess mortality rate caused 42 by the pathogen. For instance, virulence has been assumed to depend on the intrinsic reproductive rate 43 of the parasite [16]. Other research expresses the transmission rate \u03b2 and the recovery rate \u00b5 in terms 44 of a parameter \u03bd that represents virulence [17]. When the impact of human behaviour is discussed in 45 such models, it is discussed in terms of hypothesized effects of human behaviour on the value of the fixed 46 parameter representing virulence. A Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) virulence model by Massad et 47 al [18] shows that reducing the number of sexual partners could possibly drive HIV to be a more benign 48 pathogen. However, the model assumes that the number of sexual partners can simply be moved up or down 49 as a model parameter, whereas in reality the number of sexual partners in a population is the outcome of 50 a dynamic socio-epidemiological process that merits its own mechanistic modelling, and itself responds to 51 pathogen virulence. In general, these models do not treat human behaviour as a dynamic variable that can 52 evolve in response to transmission dynamics and influence the evolution of virulence. (A few exceptions 53 exist, including work that allows virulence to be a function of the number of infected hosts, thus capturing a 54 situation where the magnitude of the epidemics affects the ability of health care services to host patients [19].) 55 However, as human responses to both endemic and emerging infectious diseases show, human behaviour can 56 65 certain conditions, a disease can be driven extinct by reducing the fraction of the infected neighbours of an 66 individual. Zanette et al [32] showed that if susceptible individuals decide to break their links with infected 67 agents and reconnect at a later time, then the infection is suppressed. Gross [33] also shows that rewiring of 68 edges in a network (and thus social interaction) can greatly influence the spread of infectious diseases. Of 69 the compartmental models, we focus on those that have used concepts from evolutionary game theory such 70 as imitation dynamics [34] to describe the evolution of behaviour and its interplay with the epidemics. An 71 example of imitation dynamics concerns, as described in detail in [35], the effect of vaccination on the spread 72 of infectious diseases. Each individual in the population picks one strategy and adopts it: \"to vaccinate\" or 73 \"not to vaccinate\". The proportion of vaccinators is modelled using an ordinary differential equation and 74 is coupled with a standard SIR model. An important aspect of behavioural models is to couple them with 75 epidemiological processes such as transmission. This coupling creates a feedback loop between behaviour 76 and spread of the disease.",

Our 80 objective in this paper was to explore how behaviour and virulence influence one another, in a coupled 81 behaviour-disease differential equation model. The model allows individuals who perceive an increase in 82 the prevalence of infection to increase their usage of practices that reduce transmission rates (such as social 83 distancing and hand-washing) and thereby boost population-level immunity. This approach can help us 84 understand the effects specific social dimensions, such as level of concern for a strain or the rate of social 85 learning, on the coupled dynamics of pathogen strain emergence and human behaviour in a situation where 86 virulence imposes evolutionary trade-offs and is strain-specific. Instead of considering long-term evolutionary 87 processes with repeated rounds of mutation and selection, we focus on the case of invasion of a single mutant 88 strain with a large phenotypical difference compared to the resident strain. In the next section, we describe 89 101 due to infection (virulence); \u00b5 is a birth rate and \u03b4 is the background death rate.

More recently, masks became widely used during the 60 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) at the beginning of the 21st century [22] , and 61 it has been shown pathogen virulence in Marek's disease can evolve in response to how vaccines are used 62 [23] . 63 Theoretical models of the interactions between human behaviour and the spread of infectious diseases 64 are increasingly studied [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] .

We observe that the mutant strain 199 quickly displaces the resident strain and converges to an endemic state where the proportion of protectors 200 x remains relatively high (Figure 1a). On shorter timescales, we see a transient phase at the start of the 201 simulation with a sharp epidemic of the resident strain, followed by periodic epidemics with much lower 202 incidence of the mutant strain (Figure 1b,c). The numerical simulations agree with the values computed 203 from analytical expressions at equilibrium (for sufficiently large values of t). 204 Decreasing the efficacy of infection control against the resident strain and equating it to that of the more virulent strain ( 1 = 2 = 0.4, with all other parameter values at baseline values) prevents the invasion 206 of the mutant strain (Fig. 1d). This occurs because more susceptible individuals will be infected by the 207 resident strain, thereby significantly decreasing the pool of susceptible individuals available for infection by 208 the mutant strain. 209 A surprising scenario under which the invasion of the mutant strain fails is when both perceived severity 210 of the mutant strain and the efficacy of infection control against are low (Figure 1e,f, \u03c9 2 = 10 2 and 2 = 0.3 211 with other parameter values at baseline). It is worth noting in this case that we initially have a few outbreaks 212 of the mutant strain with high incidence. Fig 1f represents the same dynamics as Fig 1e but on a longer time 213 scale. The oscillations in the prevalence of infection and the prevalence of protectors is typical of coupled 214 behaviour-disease models with adaptive social behaviour [35]",

            "text": "there are parameter regimes where increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain (\u03c9 1 ) allows the mutant strain to invade(Figure 2a-c). This occurs across a nontrivial portion of parameter space236    despite the fact that R 0,2 < R 0,1 . This regime shift occurs because a sufficiently high perceived severity 237 of the resident strain creates a large pool of susceptible individuals, and coupled with a higher efficacy of 238 infection control against the resident strain, this means that the invading mutant strain can take advantage of 239 the increased pool of susceptible individuals to invade. This effect occurs only when the efficacy of infection 240 control against the resident strain is relatively high (e.g. 1 = 0.9 and 2 = 0.6). However, this phenomenon 241 does not hold when 1 and 2 are low, in which event the model behaves similar to the SI 1 I 2 R model where 242 the strain with the higher basic reproductive number invades, as expected. Similarly, increasing \u03c9 2 can push 243 the system from a regime of co-existence of the two strains to a region where only strain 2 persists.244In 1 = 2 parameter planes we again find parameter regimes where the more virulent strain can invade 245 due to adaptive social behaviour, despite the fact that R 0,2 < R 0,1 , if there is an imbalance in the perceived246 severity of the two strains. When perceived severities are sufficiently low, the mutant strain can never invade 247 (Figure 2d). But when \u03c9 2 >> \u03c9 1 , the mutant strain can invade and remove the resident strain if 1 is 248 sufficiently large and 2 is sufficiently small (Figure 2e). When \u03c9 1 >> \u03c9 2 , the mutant strain and the resident 249 strain coexist, when 1 is sufficiently large and 2 is sufficiently small (Figure 6f). Increasing the efficacy of 250 infection control against the resident strain ( 1 ) or decreasing efficacy of control against the mutant strain 251 ( 2 ) can allow the mutant strain to invade (Figure 2e-f). We note again that, surprisingly, invasion can result 252 in the elimination of the resident strain if the perceived severity of the mutant strain is significantly higher 253than that of the resident strain (\u03c9 2 >> \u03c9 1 ), but when the opposite applies, coexistence results. have showed how adaptive social behaviour greatly impacts the evolution of virulence in a coupled 256 behaviour-disease model. If we neglect social behaviour, the basic reproductive numbers of the two strains 257 are sufficient to predict which of the strains will invade a population. However, adding adaptive social 258 behaviour with asymmetric stimulation and effects on either strain to an epidemiological system completely 259 shifts how we view whether a more virulent strain will be selected for. As we have seen, social behaviour260 can either act in favour or against the invasion of a more virulent strain, and we can describe these effects 261 with reference to specific social parameters (\u03c9 1,2 ) quantifying how concerned individuals are about the two 262 strains, and control parameters ( 1,2 ) quantifying how well infection control measures like hand-washing 263 work. Most interestingly, adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible 264 epidemiological and social conditions even when it has a lower basic reproductive number. 265 Future work can generate further insights into how behaviour and virulence interact for specific infectious 266 diseases, by building on existing research on the coupled dynamics of behaviour and infection transmission. 267 For instance, an increase in the average number of sexual partners of an individual has been predicted 268 by mathematical models to cause increased HIV virulence [18, 41]. These models use a fixed parameter 269 to quantify the number of sexual partners, but the number of sexual partners could be made to evolve 270 dynamically based on the number of infected individuals in a particular population, similar to seminal 271 work using compartmental models to model core group dynamics [42]. An increase in the number of sexual 272 partners will decrease the efficacy of infection control against the more virulent strain and effectively increase 273 its transmission and hence leads to higher virulence. Other future research could explore how adaptive 274 social behaviour interacts with evolutionary trade-offs to determine virulence evolution. One of the most 275 common hypotheses is that a trade-off exists for between-host transmission and virulence. To increase its 276 probability of transmission, the parasite must replicate within the host. This replication, on the other hand, 277 must be controlled because otherwise it might lead to the host's death and therefore prevent transmission. 278 However, other trade-offs have been suggested, such as between transmission rate and host recovery rate 279 [43]. Moreover, complicated host life cycles imply that many other types of trade-offs are also possible 280 [44], and the presence of multiple trade-offs may complicate the relationship between transmission rate and 281 virulence [45]. Social behaviour could interact with evolutionary trade-offs to alter the virulence evolution 282 of an emerging pathogen, and this process could be modelled by building on existing virulence evolution 283 models.284While the model discussed in this paper serves as a general framework for studying the influence of social 285 behaviour on strain competition and emergence, further research needs to be carried out to understand the 286 interplay between the epidemiological and social parameters. For instance, we did not model virulence evo-287 lution explicitly but rather by assuming two strains have already emerged due to mutation and addressing288 conditions under which the more virulent mutant strain is more fit. Future research could instead model 289 virulence by defining transmission and recovery rates in terms of a virulence parameter, or by using an 290 adaptive dynamics approach. Future research could also explore different possible relationships between the291",
