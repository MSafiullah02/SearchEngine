Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review. Recent findings Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. Summary For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.",

This epidemic is calling for national and international attention to develop effective therapeutics including selective vaccines. Nonetheless, no specific therapeutic is yet available, leaving the patients to rely on general and supportive therapies, including oxygen supply, broad-spectrum antiviral medicines (e.g., interferon-\u03b1), glucocorticoid, and human serum albumin (HSA) [2] . Most recently, lopinavir/ritonavir, an approved anti-HIV drug, has been recommended for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [3] . Remdesivir, a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development for treating Ebola virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) diseases, has also been reported to relieve the pneumonia symptoms for the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as reported in the USA [4] . Although the drugs are showing a promising efficacy, additional therapeutic options should be explored and considered when taking into account the increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Clinical data have indicated that poor prognosis is related to the condition of iron overload observed in patients with infection of hepatitis B/C (HBV/ HCV) viruses [6] [7] [8] . For even though we know little about iron regulations in SARS-CoV-2 patients, some clues could be obtained from other viral infections (Fig. 1) . For example, iron supplementation was shown to increase the mortality in HIVinfected patients, irrespective of the severity of anemia, suggesting a detrimental role of excess iron in HIV infection [9] . HIV-1 replication is dependent on host cell enzymes, some of which are involved in transcription, viral mRNA translation, and viral assembly that require iron [5] . HIV-1 viral load dropped dramatically in a hemochromatosis patient who underwent venesection, suggesting an iron deprivationmediated control of HIV-1 replication [10] .",

CoVs enter into host cells via binding to various receptors and disassemble to release viral genome and nucleocapsid. Transcription and translation of viral genes yield viral genomic RNA and structure proteins (e.g., S, E, M, and N). After further processing and assembly in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, new CoVs are constructed. Finally, the new formed virions are exocytosed by fusing with viruscontaining vesicles. The whole process of viral replication requires iron-containing enzymes and consumes abundant ATP. Iron is a critical participant for mitochondria to produce ATP. In short, adequate iron enables the virus to complete its replication process, and otherwise iron deficiency impairs this process genome of the lineage B from \u03b2-CoV and show more than 85% identity with the genome of a bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1) [19] .

Finally, the virus is released from the Golgi and exocytosed to the extracellular compartment from the host cells by fusing with virion-containing vesicles [24] (Fig. 1 ).",

Iron is absorbed by duodenal enterocytes and released into plasma by an iron exporter protein, ferroportin, which is expressed on the basolateral side of the duodenal enterocytes. Ferroportin is also expressed in macrophages and essentially governs iron release and recycling [38] . The systemic iron homeostasis is fundamentally orchestrated by the hepcidinferroportin axis. Hepcidin is mainly expressed and secreted by hepatocytes, and can bind to its sole receptor, ferroportin. After binding to hepcidin, ferroportin is internalized and degraded, leading to the inhibition of iron absorption from the duodenum and reduction of iron release from macrophages [39] . The cellular iron uptake is primarily mediated by the interaction between iron-bound transferrin and transferrin re-ceptor1 (TfR1) [40] .",

SARS patients exhibited increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 coupled to the pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage [41] . Infection with SARS-CoV-2 also leads to the increased levels of IL1-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP10 (interferon-inducible protein 10), and MCP1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1), likely inducing T-helper-1 cell response [3] . Thus, induction of these cytokines could supposedly promote hepcidin production and lead to iron sequestration in macrophages, which warrants future investigations. Of note, macrophages are presumed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [42] . Thus, increased iron storage will most likely favor viral replication inside macrophages. Furthermore, viruses can manipulate other iron-related proteins to facilitate their replication and propagation. In the context of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), a competitor of TfR1 to bind to transferrin, is degraded after binding by US2 protein, leading to cellular iron overload [43] . In macrophages infected by HIV-1, the interaction of Nef protein and HFE also induces cellular iron overload [44] . Plus, TfR1 is also used as the receptor during the entry of several types of viruses [45, 46] .",

Currently, there are two promising strategies to deplete iron. The first strategy is to deplete iron directly by iron chelators which have strong and selective affinity with iron ions [47, 48] . Some of these iron chelators have been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical use, such as deferoxamine (DFO, Desferal\u00ae), deferiprone (DFP, Ferriprox\u00ae), and deferasirox (ICL670, Exjade\u00ae) [49] . Iron chelators can bind free iron or remove iron from ironcontaining proteins [48] . Treatment with higher doses of DFP has been shown to prolong the survival of AIDS patients after HIV-1 infection [50] . Increasing evidence suggests that iron chelators can target HIV-1 replication. The enzymatic activity of ribonucleotide reductase 2 involved in reverse transcription, which contains non-heme iron, is inhibited by DFO and 311 [51] . Bp4aT, Bp4eT, Phenyl-1-pyridin-2yl-ethanone (PPY)-based iron chelators (PPYeT and PPYaT) inhibit HIV-1 transcription by decreasing CDK2 and CDK9 activities, and by upregulating I\u03baB\u03b1 expression and downregulating nuclear NF-\u03baB [12, 13] . Topical fungicide ciclopirox and the iron chelator DFP inhibit HIV-1 gene expression at the level of transcription initiation by interfering with the hypusine modification of eIF5\u03b1 [32] . Patients treated with DFP unveiled strong HIV-1 RNA decline while on-drug and also for up to 8 weeks off-drug without viral rebound [52] . DFO and DFP inhibited HIV-1 replication in human PBMCs and macrophages but the inhibition is attributed to a decrease in cell proliferation [53] . Similar to DFO and DFP, oral uptake of bidentate iron chelators, CP502 and CP511 inhibit HIV-1 replication by reducing cellular proliferation [54] . Host cell enlargement induced by viruses, e.g., HCMV, could be inhibited by iron chelators through inhibiting mitochondrial activity and macromolecular synthesis [55] . Nonetheless, these iron chelators may be scrutinized for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.",

HIV-1 reverse transcription and transcription was suppressed in PBMCs obtained from SCD patients due to increased expression of ferroportin and therefore lowered intracellular iron [14] . On the other hand, hepcidin agonists, such as minihepcidin and thiazolidinone derivatives, can reduce systemic iron levels by compromising the function of ferroportin [56] . Nonetheless, the possible applications of agonists to target the hepcidin-ferroportin axis or other iron-related genes in order to achieve antiviral effects still need further exploration, and more efforts are thus urgently needed.",

            "text": "Apart from iron, cumulative evidence has manifested that other metals (e.g., calcium, zinc, and magnesium) are also involved in the replication process of CoVs. The entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral S protein. Under this context, previous studies have demonstrated that calcium is indispensable for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion [57] . The replication of SARS-CoV genome requires RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to synthesize descendant RNAs from a RNA template, which sternly relies on magnesium (Mn 2+ ) for its activity [58] . In the meantime, SARS-CoV RNA dimers, a prerequisite for ribosomal frameshifting, are assembled through \"kissing\" loop-loop interactions. Nonetheless, to reach more stable formation of loop-loop kissing complex, the presence of Mn 2+ appears to be necessary [59] . Regarding zinc (Zn 2+ ), the binding of Zn 2+ ions to the metal-binding domain (MBD) of SARS-CoV helicase is essential for its enzymatic activity [60] . Additionally, the maturation of CoVs requires papain-like protease (PL pro ), which could cleave the nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). However, devoid of Zn 2+ ions, the stability of the tertiary structure of SARS-CoV PL pro is compromised with diminished activity [61] . Moreover, MERS-CoV PL pro bears a folded structure and potent proteolytic and deubiquitinating activities upon binding with endogenous metal ions [62] . To this end, the above findings collectively suggest that disturbing the viral metal dependence would presumably exhibit antiviral effects.",

            "text": "Literally, versatile metal-oriented therapeutics besides iron chelators have been searched to target diseased conditions for centuries. For instance, bismuth compounds have been used clinically as medicines to treat various gastrointestinal diseases. Bismuth (Bi 3+ ) ions strikingly compete with Zn 2+ ions for the MBD of helicase, leading to compromised enzyme activities and severe deficiencies in viral replication [63] . As metal chelators, aryl diketoacids (ADK) have been verified to inhibit enzymes, such as HIV-1 integrase and HCV RdRp, in that ADKs function to repress the NTPase/helicase activities of SARS-CoV by mimicking Bi 3+ ions [64] . Mercury (Hg 2+ ) ions and Zn 2+ ions act to inhibit viral proteases, such as 3Clike protease (3CL pro ) of norovirus, PL pro of SARS-CoV, HCMV protease, and HCV NS3 protease [62] . Of note, the 3CL pro plays a vital role in viral protein maturation for SARS-CoV. In fact, their metal-conjugated compounds, including phenylmercuric acetate (PMA), toluene-3,4-dithiolato zinc (TDT), and Nethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamic acid zinc (EPDTC), elicit great inhibition on SARS-CoV 3CL pro . As a pharmaceutical excipient, PMA is widely used in parenteral and topical pharmaceutical formulations. Further, zinc acetate is added as a supplement to the drug in treating Wilson's disease [65] . Zn 2+ ions could directly impair viral RNA synthesis, due to its strong suppression on both the replication and transcription complexes [66] . As summarized above, an array of other metals besides iron incredibly account for the functions and activities of enzymes involved in CoVs' replication, which underpins rational metal-oriented therapeutic development against CoVs.",

Iron supply is required for the replication of many viruses, most likely including CoVs, and viruses rely on intracellular iron for their propagation. Emerging studies indicate that iron manipulation, such as iron chelation, is a promising adjuvant therapy in treating viral infection. While the emerging viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 is much less understood compared with HIV-1 or SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on the previous studies, it is plausible that deprivation of iron supply to the virus could serve as a beneficial adjuvant in treating the SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the prerequisite of adequate understandings on one's iron status, such as serum iron and ferritin levels, and globin content. Meanwhile, other metaloriented therapeutics could also be reasonably conceived for the antiviral purpose.",
