However, the current paradigm does not prevent all transfusion-transmitted infections and is reactive to new agents, thus accepting that some patients may be harmed before preventive measures are introduced. Several methods are now available that selectively damage DNA and RNA, thus inactivating pathogens contaminating blood components while not damaging the cells or plasma proteins of the blood component. Clinical trials have been completed and pathogeninactivated platelets and plasma are widely used in Europe. A recent consensus conference recommended implementation of pathogen inactivation when a feasible and safe method is available that inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogens. The shortcomings of our present paradigm for preventing transfusiontransmitted diseases are described, along with a summary of the status of pathogen inactivation.",

The method was also used to prepare units of solvent detergent-treated plasma made from pools of about 2,500 donors but otherwise similar to ordinary fresh frozen plasma (FFP). This product is no longer available in the United States, but a similar product is used in some other countries. The solvent detergent method is effective for viruses with a lipid envelop such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) but does not activate nonenveloped viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV) or parvovirus.",

Methylene blue is not effective against intracellular viruses, and so the blood component must undergo leukocyte reduction as part of pathogen inactivation by methylene blue. The treated plasma can then be frozen and used much the same as FFP. There is some loss of plasma coagulation factors in the methylene blue treatment process, 3, 5 but methylene blue plasma is used routinely in Great Britain, Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, and Denmark and is being considered for adoption by several other countries.",

[14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] The toxicity of riboflavin has been well studied as a vitamin, and, when it is subjected to UV light, 4 breakdown products result that are normal breakdown products in the body. 9 The toxic effects of these and the amounts infused as part of pathogen-inactivated components have been well studied and are within safety limits. 20 The alkylator compound used for RBC pathogen inactivation seems to have a satisfactory toxicity, genotoxicity, and mutagenicity profile. 12, 16, 21, 22 Pathogens Inactivated All 3 of these compounds inactivate pathogens very effectively. Amotosalen inactivates 10 4 to 10 6 of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and protozoa 13,23-33 \u275aTable 1\u275a. 34 Although prions are not inactivated by amotosalen, the risk of transfusiontransmitted prion disease is not known. The nonenveloped parvovirus is inactivated at least at the 10 5 level. 35 Riboflavin inactivates 10 4 to 10 6 of intracellular and extracellular HIV, West Nile virus (WNV), porcine parvovirus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, vesicular stomatitis virus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] The alkylator used for pathogen inactivation of RBCs also has a very robust pathogen inactivation profile. 13, 44, 45 Because most commercial assays detect full-length and incomplete and, thus, noninfectious particles, it is difficult to determine the true level of infectivity in apparently healthy blood donors. The extent to which these pathogen inactivation processes are in excess of the levels of these pathogens that would be expected in an apparently healthy blood donor who would have passed the standard medical or health evaluation is difficult to conclude. However, it seems that these 3 compounds are very effective inactivating transfusion-transmitted pathogens, including those for which no prevention strategy is currently in place.",

Patients in this study 34 who received the pathogen-inactivated platelets had significantly lower posttransfusion corrected count increments and received more transfusions. However, these patients also received lower doses of platelets owing to processing losses. When the data for patients who received doses of pathogeninactivated platelets similar to doses received by control subjects were analyzed, the posttransfusion count increments were similar to those for control subjects, 80 indicating that much of the observed difference was due to a difference in dose. This observation was confirmed on a large scale in Europe where use of pathogen inactivation has not led to an increased number of platelet transfusions. 81 Although no overall difference in adverse reactions was seen in the SPRINT study, there were small but significant increases in several types of adverse reactions in patients receiving pathogen-inactivated platelets. 34 In a more detailed report of these adverse events, it does not seem that these pathogen-inactivated platelets represented a higher-than-usual risk for patients. 82 A phase 3 clinical trial of pathogen-inactivated FFP showed that improvements in hemostasis and laboratory test results were equal and not significantly different in 121 patients with acquired coagulopathies primarily due to liver disease. 83, 84 There were no differences in the use of blood components or in bleeding complications, indicating that pathogen-inactivated FFP was as effective as untreated FFP for the treatment of acquired coagulopathy. Pathogen-inactivated FFP has also been equally as effective as untreated FFP in patients with congenital coagulopathies 85, 86 and for replacement during plasma exchange for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 87 A phase 3 trial of alkylator pathogen-inactivated RBCs has been reported. 88 This trial was halted prematurely owing to the development of RBC antibodies in patients who were receiving multiple transfusions of similar pathogen-inactivated RBCs but in a different trial. The reported trial 88 involved 223 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, and even though the trial was halted prematurely, statistical analysis revealed that the end point had been met. There were no significant differences in a combined end point involving cardiac and renal function. Thus, the trial can be considered successful, although the specific pathogen inactivation method will not be used in the future owing to antibody formation in multiply transfused patients. The manufacturer has modified the pathogen inactivation method 44, 89 in a way that it believes will no longer lead to antibody formation and will soon propose to reopen the RBC trial using the new modified method.",

A new epidemic of the RNA Chikungunya virus developed on the island, and more than 34% of the population became infected. 94 Although Chikungunya virus has not been reported to be transfusion-transmitted, its natural history is such that health officials believed that transfusion transmission was likely. Parenteral transmission by needle stick has occurred. Health and blood authorities believed it was not feasible to continue to collect blood owing to the widespread epidemic, so blood collection was halted on the island. An alternative was needed to maintain a blood supply. RBCs and frozen plasma were shipped from France, but owing to the distance and shipping time, it was not possible to provide platelets from France. Laboratory studies quickly established that amotosalen pathogen inactivation is effective against the Chikungunya virus, 95 so platelet pathogen inactivation procedures were put in place locally within a very short time. Platelets were then collected locally to meet the needs of the island. 96 Subsequent studies established that the outbreak was due to a new variant that may have enabled the virus to adapt to a new mosquito vector, 94 and there may have been as many as 2 million cases of Chikungunya virus infection worldwide in 2006. 94 The outbreak involved an African virus in an Asian mosquito, and the possibility that this virus, like WNV, could be carried to the Americas 94 has already come true. At least 37 cases are known in the United States, 97 and although these occurred in returning travelers, this could become an epidemic similar to that resulting from WNV.",

However, pathogen inactivation might not be as large an increased cost as might be expected. In addition to elimination of the patient care costs of the diseases transmitted, transmission of agents not now tested should be prevented and patients spared new infections. The countless hours spent in developing strategies to deal with new agents would be avoided, and the huge costs of testing and loss of donors owing to false-positive screening test results would be eliminated. In addition, irradiation of blood products; testing for bacterial contamination of platelets; testing for CMV and, possibly, for WNV could probably be eliminated; and 7-day storage of platelets could be reconsidered. Because plasma is replaced with a platelet additive solution during the pathogen inactivation process, more plasma is available for fractionation, thus providing some revenue. Because plasma is removed and because pathogen inactivation stops cytokine synthesis, transfusion reactions to platelets are decreased, 34 thus improving patient care and reducing the costs of managing these reactions. It seems unlikely that most currently required transmissible disease testing would be eliminated, but potential future costs of screening for T cruzi, malaria, and Leishmania species could probably be avoided, and we would be prepared if an epidemic such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or avian flu should occur.",

Substantial progress has been made in the development of pathogen-inactivated platelet, plasma, and RBC products. Safety profiles for the additives in these pathogen-inactivated methods are good. A platelet product is available in Europe, and more than 80,000 units have been administered to thousands of patients. A phase 3 trial of pathogen-inactivated platelets was completed in the United States several years ago, and a request for licensure has been submitted to the FDA. A clinical trial of a different pathogen-inactivated platelet product is under way in Europe, and this product has recently been licensed there. Pathogen-inactivated plasma (using methylene blue) is used in some European countries, and phase 3 trials of a different FFP product have also been completed. This product has been approved in Europe, and is beginning to be implemented. Three phase 3 trials of pathogen-inactivated RBC products were halted prematurely owing to antibody formation in some patients. However, before one of these trials was closed, an adequate number of patients had been entered to demonstrate clinical effectiveness of the pathogen-inactivated RBC product. The manufacturer believes the cause of the antibody formation has been eliminated and expects to reopen the RBC trial soon.",

Most of our traditional methods of evaluating blood products have involved in vitro analyses and studies of in vivo survival in a small number of healthy research subjects and patients in relatively stable condition. In contrast, studies of pathogen-inactivated blood products have looked at the most important issue, which is clinical effectiveness. Platelet studies evaluated prevention or control of bleeding, not just platelet counts. RBC studies looked at clinical outcome, not just the change in hemoglobin level. Thus, at least to some extent, the information available about pathogen-inactivated products is better than that on which we have based existing transfusion therapy. Although to some extent these new pathogen-inactivated products are not the same as those we have used for years, they do not have to be the same. What they have to be is effective for patients. If pathogen inactivation represents a true advance, the blood banking-transfusion medicine community is creative enough to adopt the technology successfully. We blood banking-transfusion medicine professionals must anticipate and embrace change. Whether pathogen inactivation will prove to be safe and effective is still being determined, but experience with thousands of transfusions in Europe is encouraging. We must consider pathogen inactivation in the broad context of history, the shortcomings of our present paradigm, and the future of transfusion safety for patients.",
