Thus, RSV accounted for 14.7% of these viral respiratory infections. Diagnosis of RSV was established by viral culture in 4 patients, by PCR in 5 cases, and by both techniques in 1 patient. No other concomitant viral pathogens were found. In addition, in 1 LTR, RSV was detected by PCR during an annual control in the absence of any respiratory symptoms. This patient was excluded from analysis. None of our patients had a secondary respiratory specimen positive for RSV in later time periods.",

Therefore, guidelines are needed to help clinicians decide whether all LTRs with documented RSV require specific treatment. Herein we have reported 10 cases of proven community-acquired lower respiratory tract RSV infections in adult lung transplant recipients. Surprisingly, as a result of delayed diagnosis, 8 of them had already improved clinically before the diagnosis of RSV infection was made. These patients therefore recovered without receiving specific anti-RSV therapy. In only 2 of these cases was the immunosuppression temporarily reduced. In 1 patient a new ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scan18, 26, 27 (for which no other cause than RSV was found) cleared spontaneously. As previously described in BMT recipients,8, 10 RSV can also be recovered from the lung of asymptomatic lung transplant recipients.28 Indeed, an eleventh, asymptomatic patient not included in this case description had a positive RSV PCR in an annual control BAL assessment. He remained clinically stable without any treatment. This case illustrates a possible detection bias in our study. Clearly, patients with asymptomatic RSV infections would not seek medical advice, so the true incidence of respiratory tract infections due to RSV in LTRs could be higher.",

Previous studies suggested that severe RSV infections may occur early after transplantation when the immune response is most compromised.6 However, a more recent study reported only 24% of infections during the first 3 months post-transplantation.5 In our cohort, only 1 patient developed an RSV infection during the first 3 months post-transplantation. He evolved favorably without any specific therapy. Clearly, further studies are needed to determine whether time after transplantation impacts on the severity of disease and necessity of treatment.",

Interestingly, half of these patients also experienced \u22653 post-RSV acute rejection episodes. Because of the small number of cases, and confounding rejection episodes, it remains difficult to ascertain the potential responsibility of RSV infections in the development and/or worsening of BOS in our cohort. However, this warrants further investigation in large LTR cohorts. A possible causality between mild RSV infections that per se evolve favorably without specific treatment and BOS would potentially have major diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Indeed, such an association would support screening for RSV in LTRs, even those with mild symptoms. Moreover, one would have to establish in controlled trials whether specific anti-RSV treatment could prevent BOS worsening in such conditions.",

This contrasts with previous reports and expert opinions,41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 which favor early specific anti-RSV treatment in LTRs. However, most of these earlier studies were retrospective, included small numbers of patients, assessed several different respiratory viruses, and contained incomplete clinical information. Finally, many recommendations were derived from BMT recipients,4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 who represent a clinically distinct patient population. We therefore suggest that LTRs positive for RSV at least 3 months after transplantation, with only minor clinical symptoms, may be observed carefully with a transient reduction of immunosuppression, and that a specific anti-RSV treatment be initiated only in cases of clinical deterioration. However, a randomized clinical trial is warranted to determine whether this less aggressive, step-by-step approach is safe, and does not expose LTRs to an increased risk of BOS development.",
