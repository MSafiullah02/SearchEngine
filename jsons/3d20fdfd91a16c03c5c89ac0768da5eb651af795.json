By bringing about entropic destabilization of the unfolded state, disulfides can confer stability on the protein. 1,2 Disulfide engineering is thus an important method of enhancing protein stability. Although the removal of a naturally-occurring disulfide in a protein molecule results in destabilization, the introduction of a non-naturally occurring disulfide bridge does not typically result in stabilization of the protein molecule. 3-5 This might be a consequence of the energetic penalty required for rearrangement of residues surrounding the cysteines to accommodate the disulfide, as well as due to loss of favorable interactions involving the original wild-type (WT) residues. 2 Alternatively, the conformational characteristics of the disulfide formed might be energetically unfavorable. A study of cross-strand disulfides in antiparallel b-sheets had previously shown that while disulfides formed at the non-hydrogen bonded registered pairs are stabilizing, those in the hydrogen bonded positions are destabilizing. 5,6 Hence, an understanding of disulfides in the context of protein structures could provide valuable information for protein engineering.

Thioredoxin is a 108 amino acid long oxidoreductase. 51 It is a monomeric, highly stable protein containing a core b-sheet flanked by helices. There are four a-helices and a distorted 3 10 helix. The a-helices designated as a1-a4 (as defined in the PDB-ID 2trx) are from residues 11-17, 32-49, 59-63, and 95-107, respectively. Each of the residues at N-termini have non-helical (/, w) values of (289.18, 26.88), (290.28, 108.78), (279.18, 118.08), and (285.28, 162.98), respectively, for residues 11, 32, 59, and 95. The residues 11, 32, 59, and 95 are the N-Cap residues of the helices in thioredoxin. Of the four helices described above, it is already known that a1 is disordered and a disulfide occurs at the N-terminus of a2 in WT Trx. We therefore, attempted to introduce disulfides at the N-terminus of helices a3 and a4, respectively. Since analysis of PDB structures showed that glycine and proline are the preferred amino acids at positions 2 and 3 of the CXXC motif, additional mutants were made incorporating these residues. Finally, to study if disulfides could be formed at non N-Cap helical positions, CYS pairs were also introduced at positions 1,4 in a3 and a4 as well as positions 7,10 in a4. This could theoretically occur if there was a change in the helix start site in the mutant protein. Since our aim was to check if disulfide formation at engineered CXXC sites could be used to probe helix start sites in proteins of unknown structure, it was important to include these positions. Thioredoxin contains two active site cysteines at positions 32 and 35. These were mutated to serines to yield nSS Trx and additional intrahelical pairs of CYS residues were introduced into this mutant background. Following expression and purification from E. coli, the redox status of the introduced CYS residues was examined by iodoacetamide labeling. Iodoacetamide will react only with reduced CYS residues, and the resultant acetylated product will result in a mass increase of 57 Da per acetylation. The results are summarized in Table  VII . Iodoacetamide labeling studies confirmed that while N-Cap-3 disulfides formed spontaneously, the 1-4 disulfides did not form until subjected to more oxidizing conditions in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate. 42 This shows that the N-Cap-3 positions of a helix are poised to form the disulfide as observed in naturally-occurring intrahelical disulfides. The absence of spontaneous disulfide formation in the 1-4 positions further reiterates the importance of the N-terminal CYS residue to be non-helical for disulfide formation. The mutant with the disulfide in the 7-10 position formed a intermolecular disulfide leading to dimer formation and is described in more detail elsewhere 46 and this mutant was not used further in the present work.
