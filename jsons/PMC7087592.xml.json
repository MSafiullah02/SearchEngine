            "text": "South Africa has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of HIV infection, estimated at 5.7 million people, about 18% of the adult population (UNAIDS 2008). In many rural areas over 40% of all pregnant women have tested positive (UNAIDS/WHO 2008), creating a health emergency of unprecedented proportions. Creating an effective and comprehensive strategy for dealing with this HIV/AIDS epidemic has not been easy, in part due to other pressing social and political issues that were coincident with the introduction of the disease. In 1982, when the first case of AIDS was diagnosed in South Africa, the country was in a state of emergency due to the policy of apartheid. When apartheid ended in 1994, the new government began to show concern for controlling the HIV outbreak; 4.3% of all pregnant women were testing positive. Although ANC government started strong on HIV issues in 1994, by 1997, it had completely reversed course, going so far as to deny the severity of the problem (Schneider and Stein 2001; Van der Vliet 2004, Butler 2005). In 1999, Thabo Mbeki was elected president, and only one year later, he began to publicly state he did not believe HIV caused AIDS. His administration decided not to fund antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV positive people using public services, including pregnant women who were at risk to pass the virus onto their child.",

            "text": "In 2003, the South African government finally devised a plan to distribute ARVs, only after the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), an AIDS activist group, sued the government and won, forcing treatment to become available. By all accounts, the process of distributing ARVs has been slow and fraught with controversy. Currently, 429,000 HIV positive people are on ARVs (UNAIDS 2008), yet the total number in need of ARV treatment is much higher (only about 17% of patients who qualified for ARVs received them in 2005) (Goggin et al. 2009). The government under Mbeki stated the cost of the medicines is too high, and their effectiveness is not known. Former President Mbeki stated on several occasions that ARVs may be \u201ctoxic\u201d (Van der Vliet 2004), discouraging their use by his own citizens despite pleas from the international community, activist groups, and other health organizations for him to reverse his position on HIV/AIDS treatment. With President Mbeki\u2019s resignation, many are optimistic that the new administration will do better in treating the HIV positive population. At this time it seems the new administration is more likely to support the use of ARVs, but President Zuma is not without his critics. In 2006, he was tried but subsequently acquitted for allegedly raping an HIV positive woman. At the trial he acknowledged having sex with the woman, who he knew to be HIV positive, but stated he took a shower after to prevent infection. He was widely condemned for these actions by women\u2019s rights and AIDS activists (BBC 2006).",

For example, the colonial perception of the indigenous tie to nature, reflecting persistent modern assumptions (following Latour 1993), are present in numerous representations of indigenous medicine. These range from images of the San of Southern Africa trekking through the desert, understanding the medicinal use of each plant, to the Native American \u2018harmonious\u2019 ties with nature, with medicine men making teas from barks and flowers to cure ills. By the beginning of the twentieth century African traditional practices, indigenous experts, and natural materials began to compete with modern biomedical medicine practiced by doctors with scientific training. The result was a reconfiguration of what counted as authentic and effective medicine, with struggles throughout the colonies over the status of indigenous medicine. Complex configurations of laws and discourses became sites in which concepts of the indigenous and modernity became entangled and disputed (Flint 2008).",

Since the media is the main source of information on HIV/AIDS in South Africa to the western world, the discourses it uses tend to color the way the global population understands the crisis. This is important because countries like the United States and the United Kingdom invest heavily in South Africa, and the public\u2019s understanding of the situation there can influence how money is spent. The money spent on HIV/AIDS is significant. For example USAID spend 5.5 million dollars out of a 5.7 million dollar budget in 2008 on HIV/AIDS outreach (USAID 2009).",

It further shifted the conversation about traditional medicine to one in which indigenous healers might be seen as a potential resource for managing the AIDS crisis, but it did so while maintaining a tendency to portray traditional healers as threatening, ignorant, and demanding of paternal control. This confusion is not new, of course, as such elisions over what traditional medicine is and does can be traced to colonial images of ignorant indigenous people relying on witchdoctors for treatment and the need of the white doctors to truly heal them from the unhealthy African environment (Brantlinger 1985; Packard 1985; Crozier 2007).",

Muti killings (also spelled muthi) are particularly prevalent in the British press from 1980 to 1999. A muti killing is a practice where a person is killed so that his or her body parts may be used for \u201cmedicinal\u201d purposes (the word muti is derived from the Zulu and Xhosa word for medicine). Several of the articles about muti killings, particularly those around 1995, discuss a very influential report commissioned by the government which came out on muti killings and witchcraft in South Africa. News coverage about muti killings during this time period usually tells of a child who was killed for his or her body parts, along with details of what each body part would be used for. One article in The Guardian chronicled the killings and associated report by stating that:A victim\u2019s hands, or parts of the hands are, for instance, regarded as symbols of possession, of success or illegal appropriation,\u2019 the report says of the ingredients used in the brews. \u2018The eyes of a victim symbolise vision and the blood can give vitality. The genitals and soft parts of a victim, such as parts of the ears, nose, the eyelids and lips, are also used (Beresford 1995).\n",

The conflating of traditional medicine with what most South Africans would consider witchcraft is rooted in colonial understanding of how traditional medicine is practiced (for an example see Melland 1923). Linking traditional medicine and violence perpetuates the notion that traditional healers are engaged in harming people, instead of healing. It was this concept that led to bans on traditional practices such as the Suppression of Witchcraft Act. This can be seen in statements such as this one in The Times:The commission blamed some traditional healers for contributing to the murders. The victims were often killed on the instructions of the healers after being consulted by people with grievances against the victims or who stood to gain from their deaths (Gulmore 1996).\n",

Drawing on the statement of a sangoma (traditional healer) provided to the Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in South Africa, Ashforth (2005) provides an important distinction between witches and traditional healers. Only witches are involved in the intentional killing of individuals for \u201chealth\u201d reasons, which are usually related to the belief that an individual is captive to \u201cevil forces.\u201d Conversely, traditional healers do not participate in the killing of individuals, and are more inclined to use spiritual means to heal or protect people who consult them for assistance. This critical distinction is rarely made in newspaper coverage of medicine in South Africa, where traditional healers are often called witchdoctors (see The New York Times (Eprile 1993), The Guardian (Beresford 1995) and (Dillner 1995), and The Times (Hornsby 1986)). Since traditional healers believe themselves to be protecting against witchcraft, the use of the word witchdoctor to describe them is considered insulting.",

A clear change in coverage occurs as 31 articles are written about HIV/AIDS in 2000 and 91 articles appear in 2001. Though the HIV infection rate had been increasing in South Africa for over a decade, it was only in 2000 that the international community began to take notice. As previously discussed, several events and circumstances forced the world to examine the epidemic occurring in South Africa, including the alarming percentage of pregnant women testing positive for HIV (approximately 24.5%, Department of Health 2000) and Thabo Mbeki\u2019s public denial that HIV causes AIDS. From 2000 to 2001, there was also intense coverage of the international trial between pharmaceutical companies and the South African government over the patents of HIV drugs. These events, and the corresponding newspaper coverage that resulted, forced a change in the type of newspaper articles about medicine in South Africa. Suddenly, an HIV/AIDS crisis was at hand. While the topic of medicine was of little importance in western media coverage before 2000, it began to define how the western media saw the country after 2000. South Africa became a country with the most HIV positive people in the world; a place forgotten not only by the West, but also forsaken by their own government, and traditional medicine was now a cure and a curse for those sick with AIDS.",

The press dubbed Tshbalala-Msimang \u2018Dr. Garlic\u2019 in many of the articles, as she was quoted as \u201cextolling nutrition over drugs (Boseley 2005).\u201d The Mbeki administration\u2019s denial that HIV caused AIDS or that ARVs were effective in treating the disease was the dominant topic in 91 articles in this period. All of these articles were critical of the administration, stating that the government \u201ckills hope\u201d (Boseley 2001), and uses \u201cquackery\u201d and \u201cstupidity\u201d (Goldacre 2007) to explain the policy.

This is further complicated, since the media equates Mbeki\u2019s policies on HIV/AIDS treatment with an increase in the use of traditional medicine (this perceived increase is seen in articles such as \u201cWith Folk Medicine on Rise, Health Group is Monitoring\u201d (McNeil 2002), although \u2018folk medicine\u2019 has been the dominant form of medicine throughout all of human history). This places even more importance on traditional medicine and indigenous knowledge although the healers who might be a resource for managing the AIDS crisis are also seen as threatening, ignorant and in need of paternal control. These notions lead us back to the exotic and/or quaint healer, who has dominated the western consciousness around medicine in Africa since the colonial period (Arnold 1988; Vaughan 1991; Flint 2008).",

According to most newspaper articles, this is both the fault of the government\u2019s lack of action and the high price of pharmaceuticals. At the same time the media is critiquing the government, they are exploring the concept of enrolling traditional healers into the fight against AIDS, as they can convince HIV positive people to take their ARVs. The South African government is represented as not only passively allowing large segments of the population to seek traditional treatments over biomedical options, but as also actively claiming the traditional treatments are the better option. They also frequently deny those interested in ARVs access to the drugs, leaving them no choice than to rely on traditional remedies. This leads to confusion in the press. We have a population being directed to traditional healers, then from the healers being directed to a biomedical system not supported by the government and therefore not able to properly care for them. The media addresses this through reporting on a rise in regulation, or calls for regulation. The lack of regulation is seen, in part, as a cause of the AIDS crisis because unregulated healers will not refer a potentially HIV positive person to a biomedical doctor, increasing the chance that person will spread the virus due to their lack of knowledge of their HIV status. An increase in regulation, especially of traditional medicine, is one way to ensure that those who need it are treated correctly, with western medicine, the same western medicine unavailable to them.",

During the colonial period regulation of traditional medicine occurred on several fronts. First, the use of witchcraft, or the supernatural for diagnostic purposes or as a treatment was banned. This was largely due to the influence of Christian missionaries who saw such practices as threatening to their efforts of conversion and had a general fear of witchdoctors (Ashforth 2005). Second, healers were forbidden to mix or compound their own herbs as medicines. Although many policy makers at the time stated a fear that the compounded medicines made by traditional healers may do harm to the people using them, the more immediate reason for the ban was that the white doctors did not want competition from traditional healers (Flint 2001, 2008). In the colonial era, traditional medicine was often the only medical care available to the majority of the population, a situation we still find today.",

There is an inability of the orientalist western imaginary to understand traditional medicine outside of the already prefigured beliefs about Africans and their traditional healing practices, as seen in how the media often conflates witchcraft with traditional medicine. In addition, among conventional medical practitioners themselves in South Africa, there is widespread belief that traditional medicines are unproven, scientifically untested, and ineffective. To the degree that there are emerging calls for the inclusion of traditional healers in contemporary HIV/AIDS treatment, informal discussions with members of the allopathic medical community suggests widespread skepticism and resistance.2 Media representations of traditional healing both support and challenge the medical establishment. By calling for inclusion, newspapers confront the expert power of doctors.
