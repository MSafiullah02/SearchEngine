            "text": "The innate immune response is an important defense against invading pathogens. Following infection, nucleic acids from microbes are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that subsequently trigger host innate immune responses [1]. Several cytosolic DNA sensors have been found, including cGAS [2], IFI16 (gamma interferon-inducible protein 16) [3], DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors) [4], AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) and RNA polymerase III [5]. The activation of DNA sensors transmit signals to adaptor proteins and activate signaling cascades that ultimately result in the production and secretion of interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. Among the adaptor proteins, STING (stimulator of IFN genes), which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria-associated membranes, recruits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IRF3, and leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1 [6]. STING is also involved in modulating innate immune responses against RNA virus infections [7]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus, Sendai virus (SeV), and vesicular stomatitis virus trigger STING signaling dependently and independently of DNA detection [8]. Additionally, STING may be associated with autoimmune diseases, lipid metabolism [8], and tumor development [9]. Upon infection with a DNA virus or retrovirus, cGAS recognizes cytosolic viral DNA and causes the production of type-I IFN and the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [10]. However, some viruses have evolved the ability to inhibit the function of STING and evade the host antiviral defenses. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1) that blocks STING by preventing its interaction with TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), thereby inhibiting STING's phosphorylation, resulting in an inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway [11]. HSV-1 UL46 protein binds to STING and blocks the interferon response triggered by 2\u2032 3\u2019 -cGAMP [12]. Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax and HBV polymerase reduce the K63-linked ubiquitination of STING and interfere with the interactions between STING and TBK1, which may promote the persistent infections [13], [14]. Except that some DNA viruses can regulate the cGAS-STING pathway, a recent study reported that enveloped RNA viruses, including influenza virus (IAV), are able to stimulate a cGAS-independent STING pathway, and IAV antagonizes the pathway through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP) interacting with STING [15].",

Here, we characterized canine STING and show that canine STING induces the activation of the IRF3, NF-\u03baB pathways, and the expression of ISGs in MDCK cells. Knockdown of STING does not affect the production of IFN-\u03b2 triggered by poly(dA:dT), poly(I:C), and SeV.

STING is an important signaling adaptor in the activation of type I IFN responses during infection with DNA and RNA viruses and bacteria. However, it has emerged as a target that is recognized and antagonized by viruses including DENV, HCV, HCoV-NL63, PEDV, and SARS-CoV to ultimately block the IFN pathway [7]. In this study, we characterized canine STING and found that its overexpression leads to the induction of the IFN response via IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. However, knockdown of STING did not inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 response triggered by poly(dA:dT), poly(I:C), or SeV. Finally, overexpression of STING significantly inhibited the replication of canine influenza virus H3N2. Collectively, our findings indicate that STING is involved in the regulation of the IFN-\u03b2 pathway in canine.",

These data indicate that the STING-mediated innate immune response is conserved in canines.
