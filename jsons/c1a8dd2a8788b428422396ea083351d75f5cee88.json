BSP analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 possessed a relative stable effective population size (N e ) during the first month (Dec 23, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) of the virus outbreak (Figure 1b). A slow but accelerating reduction in the N e was observed from Jan 22, 2020, with a sharp reduction of the lower 95% HPD of the N e from Feb 5, 2020. A sharp reduction in the Ne suggests the initiation of a bottle-neck-effect in the virus population size. A bottle-neck-effect indicates that the current circulating virus strain was trapped, and more mutations in the virus genome will potentially occur to help the virus escape, resulting in a leap in the virus population. Despite the BSP was generated from a limited sample size, the results suggested a possible initiation of a bottle-neck-effect in the population size of SARS-CoV-2, indicating more infected cases will occur in the near future due to the increased mutations in the viral genome. Despite the SARS-CoV-2 remains relative stable, thirteen clade/sub-clade-specific mutations were observed in the present study (Figure 1a). The mutations at nt 8782 and nt 28144 were clade specific, i.e., C8782T and T28144C were only occurred in Clade 1, rather than in Clade 2. Only a viral strain (EPI_ISL_406592 from Guangdong, China) in Clade 1 did not possess C8782T, while all strains in Clade 1 possess T28144C. Eleven out of the thirteen sub-clade specific mutations were also observed (Figure 1a). Seven mutations were located in Clade 1, among which C29095G and C24034T/T26729C were observed in a sub-clade consisting of viral strains from China (outside Wuhan) and USA, respectively. G28878Aand G29742A were observed in a subclade of viral strains from Australia and USA. Four mutations were located in Clade 2, among which C21707T and C28854T were observed in a 3 / 6 sub-clade consisting of viral strains from China (outside Wuhan) and USA. C17373T was observed in a sub-clade of viral strains from China (outside Wuhan), USA and Singapore. G26144T was observed in a sub-clade of viral strains from USA, Taiwan, Australia, Sweden, Italy, and Singapore. Seven of the observed mutations resulted in non-synonymous mutations in the translated viral protein, including two mutations in nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (C28854T: Ser-Phe; G28878A: Ser-Asn), one mutation in ORF1ab polyprotein (T18488C: Ile-Thr), Surface glycoprotein (C21707T: His-Tyr), ORF3a protein (G26144T: Gly-Val), ORF8 protein (T28144C: Leu-Ser), and ORF10 protein (G29742A: Arg-His).
