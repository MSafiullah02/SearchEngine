It is characterized clinically by symptoms and signs resulting from inflammation and consolidation of the lung parenchyma, and histologically by the presence of buds of granulation tissue filling the distal airspaces as a reparative process following damage to the alveolar epithelium. Although its histological features were known since the beginning of the twentieth century, the clinico-pathological syndrome of organizing pneumonia has only been described in the early 1980s [1, 2].",

To clarify this issue, the term BOOP has now been replaced by the more accurate term of organizing pneumonia (OP) [3]. If OP occurs in association with an identified cause or clinical condition, it is called secondary organizing pneumonia (SOP). If no cause is identified, OP is termed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). COP has been integrated in the international classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias in 2002 [3], and further confirmed in the 2013 update of this classification [4]. The term \u201corganizing pneumonia\u201d has been used both by pathologists to designate a particular but otherwise unspecific histopathological lesion, and by clinicians to describe a specific clinico-pathological syndrome. To clearly identify these two distinct but overlapping concepts, the term organizing pneumonia is now used for the clinico-pathological syndrome, whereas the term organizing pneumonia pattern designates the histopathological lesion [3].",

A chest X-ray showed a left basal infiltrate. A course of antibiotic therapy had no effect, and the patient was referred to a respiratory physician. A chest CT-scan revealed multiple alveolar opacities with air bronchogram in the lingula, middle lobe, and left lower lobe. Bilateral crackles were present. The patient had never smoked, did not take any medication, had no symptoms of connective tissue disease, and no environmental exposure. C-reactive protein was 38 mg/dL. Hemoglobin was 114 g/L. Leucocytes differential count was normal. Antinuclear antibodies were positive at 1/320 but rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-double strand DNA and anti-nucleoprotein antibodies were negative. BAL differential count showed 52 % lymphocytes, 6 % neutrophils, and 4 % eosinophils. Cultures were negative. Transbronchial biopsies showed mild chronic interstitial inflammation and intraalveolar fibroblastic buds. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Because of old age, prednisone was started at only 0.5 mg/kg/day (25 mg/day). After 3 days, cough and general symptoms had completely resolved, and dyspnea was markedly reduced. After 2 weeks, chest X-ray was improved. Prednisone was well tolerated and maintained at the same dose for 2 more weeks then tapered over 6 months. The patient was informed about the risk of relapse.",

            "text": "The multifocal form is the most typical presentation of OP and accounts for 40\u201370 % of all cases [22, 23, 26, 32]. It is characterized by multiple bilateral alveolar opacities predominating in the subpleural regions and the lower lung zones, often containing an air bronchogram (Fig. 24.2) [14, 18, 19, 32\u201334]. A chest computed tomography (CT) is a useful non invasive procedure if OP is suspected, as it often shows more opacities than the chest X-ray, and this multifocal pattern provides an important diagnostic clue for OP. Spontaneous disappearance of some opacities over time and appearance of new infiltrates in other sites occurs in 25\u201350 % of cases of OP [23, 31], either before treatment or when a relapse occurs (Fig. 24.3). This phenomenon called \u201cmigratory opacities\u201d provides another important diagnostic clue for OP, as the differential diagnosis is relatively narrow (Table 24.2). Positron emission tomography has shown a significant fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in OP presenting with parenchymal consolidation [35], but this procedure is not part of the routine assessment of OP. Pleural effusion has usually been reported as uncommon in OP [19, 23], although a small effusion has been found in up to 35 % of cases in one series [28]. A moderate enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes may be found in about 14 % of cases [36].\n\n\n",

This tumor-like appearance frequently leads to surgical resection, and the diagnosis of OP is made retrospectively at pathological examination. In one report, lung resections for isolated nodular OP represented 0.8 % of 1,612 thoracic surgical procedures performed in a 3-year period at one institution [40]. In 105 patients with nodular OP from five series, preoperative transthoracic or transbronchial biopsy was performed in only 23 % of patients (range 0\u201383 %), whereas 70 % underwent a wedge resection or a segmentectomy (range 17\u2013100), and 7 % had a lobectomy (range 0\u201324 %). The surgical procedure was curative in most cases without the need for subsequent corticosteroid therapy [40, 41]. Of note, in all of 17 non-operated cases, a spontaneous improvement of the opacity was observed [39, 43]. One practical difficulty in the management of nodular OP is thus to avoid unnecessary lobectomy in this benign disorder mimicking lung cancer. The causes of nodular OP are discussed later in this chapter.",

It has mainly been reported in early series of OP, suggesting misclassification or overlap with other entities which were unknown at that time. Some early descriptions of diffuse infiltrative OP would probably be now better classified as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia described in the 1990s and characterized histologically by homogeneous chronic interstitial inflammation and/or fibrosis with preserved lung architecture, in which intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue are a common ancillary finding. Hence, OP pattern representing usually less than 10 % (but sometimes up to 20 %) of the total abnormalities is found in half of cases of NSIP at surgical lung biopsy [53, 54]. Sampling of such focal OP lesions by transbronchial biopsies might thus have led to misdiagnose NSIP as diffuse infiltrative OP. It has also been suggested that a continuum exists between OP and NSIP [54], and that OP/NSIP overlap might explain part of the diffuse infiltrative cases of OP [55]. Hence, patients presenting at imaging with both interstitial changes (histologically corresponding to NSIP) and consolidations (histologically corresponding to OP) have been reported [56]. In a large series of NSIP, the distinction between OP and NSIP has been based upon whether OP pattern represents more or less than 10 or 20 % of the total abnormalities at surgical lung biopsy, an arbitrary criterion [54]. In support of the concept of overlap between OP and NSIP, one study of 22 patients with OP proven by surgical lung biopsy and prolonged CT follow-up reported the evolution of OP consolidations into reticular changes resembling NSIP pattern in a subset of patients [57]. The coexistence of OP and NSIP histological patterns at surgical lung biopsy has been especially observed in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, in contrast with other autoimmune diseases [58], but more histological data are needed to support the concept of OP/NSIP overlap as a distinct entity.",

In COP, a combination of typical BAL and multiple patchy parenchymal consolidations at imaging has been found diagnostic in half of cases in one series in the absence of a biopsy, and this strategy deserves further studies [36]. If the risk/benefit ratio of lung biopsy is considered unfavorable due to old age, frail patient or significant comorbidities, a presumptive diagnosis of OP and an empirical treatment of prednisone may be an acceptable strategy. However, the disadvantages of prolonged empirical corticosteroid therapy in the absence of a clear diagnosis, and the risk of false diagnosis of OP, should also been kept in mind. Hence, disorders mimicking the clinical and imaging features of OP may initially respond to corticosteroid treatment, including GPA (Wegener\u2019s), primary pulmonary lymphoma, NSIP, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Therefore, if the disease follows an unusual course or the response to therapy is inadequate, the diagnosis of OP should be reconsidered, especially if the initial diagnosis was made without biopsy or with transbronchial biopsy only.",

It frequently occurs in association with various infections mostly caused by bacteria, but occasionally also by viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Another frequent cause of OP is a drug reaction [73]. A comprehensive and updated list of incriminated drugs is available on www.pneumotox.com. OP can also arise in the context of connective tissue diseases such as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies or rheumatoid arthritis, and in various types of solid cancers and hematologic malignancies, where it should not be mistaken for neoplasm progression or recurrence [77]. One example is provided by bleomycin toxicity: besides diffuse interstitial lung disease, bleomycin can also occasionally induce OP manifesting as pulmonary nodules mimicking metastatic tumor [78\u201380]. OP can also occur during myelo- or lymphoproliferative syndromes, and after lung or bone marrow transplantation. In the latter, an association has been recently demonstrated between OP and both acute and chronic forms of graft-versus-host disease, suggesting that a causal relationship may exist between these two conditions [81].\n",

Affected patients are women treated by tumorectomy or mastectomy followed by chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy of approximately 50 Gy on the tumoral site and homolateral lymph nodes. The clinical picture is identical to COP and starts on average 14 weeks after the irradiation, although it can occur up to 1 year later [82]. In contrast to classical radiation pneumonitis, which is limited to the radiation field, radiation-induced OP also affects the lung outside the radiation field and frequently involves the controlateral lung. Opacities may be migratory. BAL shows a typical mixed pattern alveolitis. The outcome is favorable under corticosteroid treatment [82]. Despite the frequent occurrence of relapses, a complete cure is usually observed. In milder cases, spontaneous disappearance without corticosteroids has been reported [88]. Interestingly, this variant of OP has been almost exclusively described in women irradiated for breast carcinoma, and only rarely in individuals of both genders irradiated for other types of tumors, especially lung cancer. The particular tangential irradiation fields used for breast cancer could play a role. A bilateral lymphocytic alveolitis has been reported to occur in 85 % of women receiving unilateral irradiation for breast cancer and, despite being asymptomatic in most cases, could be an early event in the occurrence of OP [89]. Hormonal factors could also be involved. Hence, in one study, age >50 and anti-estrogen therapy were significantly correlated with the occurrence of OP, with odd ratios of respectively 8.88 and 3.05 [87]. However, given the importance of hormonal therapy for tumor control in these patients, avoidance or interruption of hormonal therapy to prevent or cure OP cannot be recommended at the present time.",

Although some authors found focal OP to be idiopathic in most cases [41], others have reported underlying COPD in up to 67 % of cases, and recurrent respiratory infections in up to 57 % [40], suggesting that focal OP may be triggered and preceded by an infectious process. In support of this hypothesis, one study reported the occurrence of small neutrophil aggregates in the vicinity of localized OP (with otherwise typical OP pattern at histopathology) in 73 % of cases [42]. Aspiration of food particles may be another cause of focal OP [90]. In one retrospective study of 59 cases of aspiration pneumonia, OP pattern was the predominant histopathological pattern in 88 %, usually associated with particulate foreign material, multinucleated giant cells, acute pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or suppurative granulomas [90]. Twenty-two percent of these cases presented as solitary nodules suspect of lung cancer, whereas food aspiration was clinically suspected in less than 10 % [90]. Infraclinical particulate matter aspiration pneumonia may thus be a relatively common cause of lung nodules presenting with OP pattern at histopathology. Interestingly, the prevalence of active or former smoking appears high in series of isolated nodular OP (57\u201393 %) [39\u201343]. It is currently unknown whether smokers are more prone to develop this presentation of OP, or are simply more likely to undergo a surgical procedure for such nodular lesions resembling lung cancer.",

However, this duration can extend up to 12 months or even longer due to relapses in a significant proportion of patients. Side effects of prolonged corticosteroid treatment occur in up to 25 % [22]. In an attempt to better define the corticosteroid treatment in COP, a standardized therapeutic regimen has been proposed by the French Groupe d\u2019Etudes et de Recherche sur les Maladies Orphelines Pulmonaires (Table 24.5) [22]. A retrospective comparison of patients having received this standardized protocol with a group treated with other therapeutic regimens did not reveal any differences in terms of efficacy, delay to remission, occurrence of relapses, morbidity, or final outcome [22]. In contrast, cumulated doses of prednisone after 1 year were reduced twofold in the group having received the standardized treatment [22]. This therapeutic regimen may thus provide a framework to guide management and limit the burden of corticosteroid therapy, while maintaining the same efficacy on disease control as higher doses of prednisone. However, given the wide clinical expression and severity of the disease, a unique treatment regimen cannot cover all clinical situations and physicians need to adjust the prednisone dose to disease severity, response to therapy, and side effects. In severe OP, prednisolone IV boluses during 3 consecutive days [47\u201349] and immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or cyclosporin A have been used [46, 50, 51, 91, 92], especially in acutely ill patients who do not improve within a few days of corticosteroid treatment. However, the efficacy of these strategies is not established. Whether the patients requiring immunosuppressive drugs in addition to prednisone had more frequently a diffuse infiltrative pattern than a multifocal pattern at imaging is unclear, as detailed chest CT scan analysis was not available in most of these cases.\n",

Single or multiple relapses have been reported in up to 58 % of cases [22]. Most relapses occur within the first year, while patients are still taking low-dose prednisone (usually <10 mg/day) for the initial episode. A relapse occurring under higher doses (>20 mg/day) or >18 months after the initial episode is unusual and should prompt to carefully re-assess the diagnosis. The cause of relapses is unknown, but the initial episode of COP and the subsequent relapses may be viewed as a single pathological process, which progressively abates over time [22]. Relapses are not due to insufficient prednisone dose for the initial episode, but delayed treatment onset could be a risk factor [22]. Other factors associated with the occurrence of relapses include more severe hypoxemia at first examination [98], elevation of serum gamma-glutamyl-transferase and alkaline phosphatase [22], and the multifocal form of OP [99]. Importantly, relapses did not affect morbidity and mortality [22]. Therefore, preventing relapses by extending treatment duration appears unnecessary in most cases, and the strategy should rather aim at minimizing the adverse effects of corticosteroids. To avoid unnecessary concerns, the possible occurrence of relapses, and even multiple relapses, should be explained to the patient during tapering of prednisone for the initial episode. The occurrence of a relapse in OP should prompt to reconsider the hypothesis of a persisting causal agent, such as a drug, which has not been removed initially.",

            "text": "Patients with severe OP have been reported in several small series and isolated cases [23, 46, 47, 50\u201352]. Some of these cases were secondary to collagen vascular diseases, drugs, or toxic exposure to an aerosol textile dye [50\u201352] and others were idiopathic [23, 46, 47, 52]. In the 44 cases from five series with available data [46, 47, 50\u201352], nearly all patients received high-dose corticosteroids, 32 % received immunosuppressive drugs (mostly cyclophosphamide), and 43 % required mechanical ventilation. Twenty-seven percent recovered, 9 % evolved to chronic respiratory insufficiency or required lung transplantation, and 64 % died. Factors which have been associated with a poorer outcome in OP include presence of collagen vascular disease [50], diffuse infiltrative pattern at imaging [14, 100], absence of lymphocytosis at BAL [14, 50], and interstitial fibrosis with architecture remodeling of lung parenchyma at histopathology [46]. As several of these characteristics are atypical in OP, it is possible that some of these cases had in fact other disorders in which OP pattern was only an ancillary histological finding, such acute interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, or acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (see below). Alternatively, some cases may have had a true overlap between OP and one of these entities. Hence, among ten patients with severe OP and characteristic OP pattern at lung biopsy, seven died and five of them had associated UIP pattern, honeycombing or DAD at autopsy [50]. In other cases, OP may have been the initial pathologic process, but lung injury may have occurred as a secondary event due to superimposed infection or drug toxicity. Both multifocal and diffuse infiltrative imaging patterns have been described in severe OP [52].",

The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (71 %), cough (24 %), fever (35 %), weakness (29 %), and thoraco-abdominal pain (29 %). One or more associated conditions were identified in two thirds of cases including history of environmental exposure, drug exposure, connective tissue disease, and co-morbidities resulting in altered immunity (Table 24.6). Other cases were idiopathic. Most frequent chest X-ray features included bilateral basal and diffuse opacities, but detailed chest CT imaging characteristics were not available. Two distinct disease patterns and outcomes were identified, each affecting about half of cases: (1) severe rapidly progressive disease resembling classical DAD and leading to death within less than 1 month, and (2) mild subacute disease course resembling classical OP (Fig. 24.6a), and leading to recovery. The overall mortality rate was 53 %, which was similar to adult respiratory distress syndrome and much higher than classical OP. At lung histopathology, the dominant findings were prominent intra-alveolar fibrin balls filling around 50 % (range 25\u201390 %) of the alveolar spaces with a conspicuous patchy distribution and a relatively normal intervening lung parenchyma. OP pattern with buds of fibroblasts within airspaces was present in all cases, but was usually less abundant than the intra-alveolar fibrin (Fig. 24.6b). Associated features included mild to moderate interstitial infiltrate with edema, predominant lymphocytes, sparse neutrophils, and type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia. There were no hyaline membranes, abcesses, or granulomas. No histological characteristics were found predictive of outcome.

AFOP differed from typical acute infectious pneumonia by the absence of significant neutrophilic inflammation. AFOP also markedly differed from classical OP by the predominance of intra-alveolar fibrin over intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue. Besides histopathological differences, AFOP and classical OP were characterized by different disease course [59]. However, one cannot rule out that AFOP corresponds to a particular variant of severe OP, with lung biopsy performed at an early stage of the OP pathogenic process when fibrin fills the alveolar spaces before being colonized by proliferating fibroblasts to constitute the classical buds of granulation tissue. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.",

In the original report, most patients received antibiotics and/or corticosteroids, but no correlation was found between treatment modalities and outcome [59]. However, more than half of the patients did not receive corticosteroids, or received them late in the disease course. It therefore cannot be concluded that steroids are not effective in AFOP. Furthermore, significant and even dramatic improvement with corticosteroids has been reported by some authors [101]. The usefulness of cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil in addition to corticosteroids has been occasionally reported [102, 103]. Similarly to classical COP, relapses have been reported in AFOP [101].",
