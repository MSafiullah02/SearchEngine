The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognize the importance of improving methods for assessing short-term predictions of influenza activity by hosting an annual influenza forecasting challenge [4]. Several data sources have been used to monitor the influenza activity in the USA and as calibration data for forecasting models. Data include both direct measures of influenza such as the official CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) data [5] and indirect measures such as Internet search queries. The validity of Internet search queries, which have included Google [6\u201312], Twitter [13,14] and Wikipedia [15,16], as proxy measures of influenza activity have been the subject of some debate [12]. However, the rapid availability, low cost of acquisition and potential to access Internet search query data at relatively high spatial resolution make these data sources attractive options for many teams participating in the annual CDC's influenza prediction challenge [17].",

The reason to introduce these different kinds of smoothing is the following: the daily estimate of the last day of a week depends only on the CDC's ILI of the beginning of the week, while 1 day later, the daily estimate of a first day of a week depends only on the CDC's ILI estimate of the next week. This sort of discontinuity can lead to less smooth behaviour as depicted in figure 1 and can be addressed by introducing the smoothing factor \u03b1. We will use the partial smoothing in the main text as it seems to have the best performance (electronic supplementary material, figure A6). If a data point, xdi, is missing (this happens for 8 days in epidemic weeks 16 and 17 of 2009 and for 4 days in December 2011), the last previous valid data point is used.",

The log-score measure categorizes the per cent ILI in bins of size 0.1 (e.g. [1.0% ILI, 1.1% ILI], [1.1% ILI, 1.2% ILI]). The score is obtained by summing over the forecasting distribution that falls within the bin containing the true value plus the five preceding and five subsequent bins (electronic supplementary materials, Scoring System and figure A1 for details). While the log-score is a valuable instrument for comparing predictions, it is not an intuitive measure, so we also report the reduction in inter-quantile distance which we calculate as the difference between the 95%-quantile and the 5%-quantile of the posterior distribution.",

By using daily Wikipedia data, we are able to achieve an absolute reduction in inter-quantile distance by an average 0.24% ILI for the two-week predictions, a 0.76% ILI reduction for the three-week predictions and a 1.64% ILI reduction for the four-week predictions (figure 4). This narrower posterior translates to a reduction in prediction uncertainty.

Since the true values of parameters are not known, we cannot use a log-score measure, and instead we use inter-quantile distance to evaluate the parameter distributions. There is a substantial reduction in parameter uncertainty for Reff (figure 5) which can be largely attributed to an uncertainty reduction in the time-varying R0(t) (electronic supplementary material, figure A5).
