From April 2011 to March 2014, we collected oropharyngeal swabs from children less than 5 years of age with symptoms of ILI who presented to the outpatient departments of Suzhou University Affiliated Children's Hospital (SCH). We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) or PCR to detect 11 respiratory viruses. Among 3,662 enrolled ILI patients, 1,292 (35.3%) tested positive for at least one virus. Influenza virus (16.9%) was detected most frequently (influenza A 7.4%, influenza B 9.5%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (5.6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-4 (4.8%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (3.8%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (3.5%), and adenovirus (ADV) (3.0%). Co-infections were identified in 108 (2.9%) patients. Influenza virus predominantly circulated in January-March and June-July. The 2013-2014 winter peaks of RSV and influenza overlapped. Compared with other virus positive cases, influenza positive cases were more likely to present with febrile seizure, and RSV positive cases were more likely to present with cough and wheezing, and were most frequently diagnosed with pneumonia. These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of ILI among children less than 5 years of age in Suzhou, China. Influenza is not only the most frequently identified pathogen but it is also the only vaccine preventable illness among the 11 pathogens tested. Such findings suggest the potential value of exploring value of influenza vaccination among this influenza vaccination target group. J. Med. Virol. 88:1334 -1340 , 2016 .",

The etiology of ARIs is often unknown, because viral testing among patients with respiratory symptoms is uncommon [Ju et al., 2014] . Many countries conduct influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance, and monitor cases of respiratory illness with fever. Data from these surveillance systems suggest that ILI is caused by a wide range of respiratory viruses, including seasonal influenza A and B viruses (FLU A and FLU B), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV A and RSV B), parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (PIVs 1-4), human rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (ADV), and others [Ren et al., 2009; Buecher et al., 2010; Razanajatovo et al., 2011; Thiberville et al., 2012] . Recent advances in molecular detection techniques have facilitated the identification of several novel respiratory viruses that could also cause influenza-like illness, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63 and HKU1), and more [van der Hoogen et al., 2001; van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005; Allander et al., 2007] .",

Our percent positive was lower than that observed in other studies conducted among children less than 5 years of age seeking outpatient care for ILI in southern China: Huizhou [Ju et al., 2014] (57.9%), Zhuhai (44.8%), and the central China city of Wuhan [Peng et al., 2012] (55.8% during 2008-2010, which covered the 2009 H1N1 pandemic period). While the differences in percent positive among studies might be explained by numerous factors, including case definition, specimen types, and population distribution, one factor that may have led to an underestimation of cases testing positive for at least one virus in our study is that, unlike the studies in Huizhou [Ju et al., 2014] and Wuhan [Peng et al., 2012] , we did not used the commercial kit to test the viruses, which might affect the yield. In addition, we did not test for viral pathogens such as human rhinovirus and human coronavirus, which are common etiologies of ARIs in children [Cui et al., 2011; Song et al., 2013] .

These data are consistent with the positive rates observed in other studies among children less than 5 years old in China [Peng et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Ju et al., 2014] . In Italy, the most common viruses causing ILI among young children in 2008-2009 were influenza virus A, followed by rhinovirus, and RSV [Razanajatovo et al., 2011] . In Belgium, the most commonly identified viruses causing ILI among young children in 2009 were influenza virus and RSV [Hombrouck et al., 2012] , while in France 2009, the most frequent respiratory viruses were RSV and human metapneumovirus [Falchi et al., 2011] . Of note, these European studies were all carried out during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic period, which may have influenced the spectrum of viruses circulating at the time. During the influenza pandemic period, the activity of several non-influenza respiratory viruses was reduced or delayed compared to non-pandemic periods. RSV, which in many countries has been reported to be almost as common a cause of ARIs among children as influenza, causes the greatest burden of disease among children less than 5 years of age compared with older children [Nair et al., 2010] . In our study, RSV was the second most commonly detected virus after influenza virus. RSV infection occurred predominantly in the spring and winter seasons, and the 2013-2014 winter peak of RSV overlapped with the influenza virus peak. RSV commonly confounds the study of the epidemiology and disease burden of influenza. The co-circulation of RSV with influenza virus impacts the sensitivity and positive predictive value of ILI surveillance for influenza activity [Tang et al., 2010; Ruf and Knuf, 2014] . Therefore, when capacity does not allow for laboratory confirmation of respiratory viruses, epidemiologists should consider how RSV may impact ILI surveillance data, as RSV is likely contributing to ILI disease burden, particularly in December-April.",

First, we did not detect other viruses known to cause ILI in children, such as human rhinoviruses and human coronavirus, which likely led to an underestimation of our viral positive rate among ILI cases. Second, the lack of controls may be a more relevant issue given that some of these viruses could have been associated with carriage or shedding from a previous or impending illness event, particularly during co-infections. Third, the loss of sensitivity inherent in the use of the ILI case definition (particularly as operationalized as measured fever) and throat swabs alone. It was reported that using ILI which requires measure fever could drop the sensitivity by >10% and that only obtaining throat swabs could drop the sensitivity by another 10% [Dawood et al., 2015] .",

Although the majority of ILI cases testing positive for at least one virus tested positive for a respiratory virus other than influenza, it is important to consider the contributions of co-circulating viruses when evaluating the burden and cost of influenza-associated ILI outpatient visits. Influenza is the most common frequently identified pathogen and the unique vaccine preventable illness. The local children still would benefit from the improvement in influenza vaccination coverage.",
