            "text": "Microblogging website Twitter has emerged as one of the primary online social media platforms across the globe for sharing opinions, interests, and points of view on events and issues varying from education, sports, online content to politics. Users on Twitter can associate their share of opinions related to a subject matter by writing a simple tweet and posting it in real-time. The selection of right expletives and positioning the same in a tweet sentence plays a critical role in attracting the attention of right receivers (users of Twitter) of this tweet with similar interests inside the Twitter platform. Sharples [1] has claimed that readers on any platform of communication should treat writing as a creative act of writers using which they deliberately select phrases and position them to impose a certain interpretation through lexical and linguistic preferences. This hypothesis was first developed by Maun [2], showing how diverse set of writers from various backgrounds, are extremely cognizant of articulated aspects of writing, positioning the expletives with opinions that we should hypothesize as writing practice and as an act of thoughts representation. The idea of sentence writing includes the design of the factual or non-factual information of a topic, person, event or domain, followed by opinion generation through experience or knowledge expressed in words, within a framework requiring the expertise of linguistics as well as the nature of genres and domains in which the communication is taking place. The sentence then reaches the receiver (also referred to diffusion in modern world) to whom the original writer/sender was planning to convey the message to. The receiver in turn again uses the knowledge of linguistics to interpret the meaning which original sender was trying to convey. Hence linguistic competence is central to understand the degree of diffusion of information in any communication channel.",

This, in turn, creates mass information on Twitter. The ability of Twitter to elevate the exposure of any information through a simple tweet is contained in various aspects of the same tweet. Like the number of users connected to the account from which the tweet got generated, how active the user has been in the past, how active the followers in the network of the user are on Twitter.",

            "text": "To achieve effective diffusion of information, other than the previously listed factors, one more aspect that plays a key role is: the sentence used in a tweet should be conveying the appropriate information with a factual point of view. Prior research appears a little apprehensive about the accurate enriching relationship between the selection of words, placing in a certain order, and about how the thoughts get reconstructed when we alter the sequence of words. The area of linguistics has well-described literature on how a well-formed sentence structure can guide the communication of inference and opinion expressed and at the same time increase the penetration of the sentence at the user level. Aligning the sentences for an appropriate theme and rheme and the idea of linearization of the words in which \u2018what an author places first will drive the interpretation and penetration of rest that has to follow\u2019 [3] are known ideas to linguist researchers. Also is the goal of concluding remarks in a sentence [4]: because the initial vocable or noun in a phrase gains more importance, and professional writers will change the order of the words to engage the reader\u2019s attention to the factual information using the active mode of writing a sentence. These are design alternatives which the writer of a sentence or a tweet on Twitter has to learn and there are options within this learning that require attention, be it direct or indirect, that a verbally spoken sentence is not the same as a written one. Using the linguistic aspect of feature formation is not entirely explored in the area of research of feature extraction from verbatim of tweet [5\u20138].",

We assign custom weights to the word vector matrix calculated by the index of these words in the neighborhood of the sequence of the rest of the words in the same sentence. We are further defining this feature engineering framework as Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE). We then try to combine this feature engineering framework with the state of the art Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to train an initial model that is further optimized by adding convolutional layer 1D on top of embedding to make it more time-efficient while training and improve the accuracy as well. For benchmarking the results of classification using the proposed architecture, we compare the overall accuracy with a CNN model running on the same architecture using a pre-trained glove word embedding instead of the experimented Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE). In the scope of current research, we hypothesize that the proposed framework works better in classifying a tweet as re-tweetable or not if we take into consideration the linguistic art of sentence formation. The ideology behind the research in the current paper is to create the features in such a way that these are not only geography independent but also independent of any theme of any event which makes the proposed framework easily generalizable in any situation.",

When there is more communication there is more information diffusion too [9\u201311]. We define information diffusion as the travel process of a piece of knowledge having factual or non-factual details about a person, event, domain or place getting initiated from a sender and reaching a set of receivers through a channel or carrier. In the case of Twitter [12, 13], the carrier is the tweet posted on the channel Twitter, the sender is the user posting the tweet and receivers are followers of the user posting the tweet. There are three aspects of information diffusion: innovation in communication practice, factual information and right audience (user-network) which plays an important role in predicting the degree of information diffusion.",

Twitter is constantly explored by organizations and individuals for multiple communications which creates an abundance of information and hence researchers have started exploring various analysis frameworks to gain insights and one such framework is Social Media Analytics (SMA). SMA as an evolving cross-domain research area for gaining insights through social media has made the usage of Twitter for information communication and diffusion across multiple domains possible. Many researchers from their work have proved the potential of SMA across different academic disciplines and business domains. Prior work strongly shows that SMA can provide important insights around disciplines such as marketing [14], in deliberation on political [15] and social concerns [16], in emergency [17], for building public relation [18] or even ruling out possibility of polarization of any major event [19]. Social media platforms like Twitter can also help us to gain insights into any specific domain [20] or technology [21]. However, in the domain of social media, penetration and diffusion of communication has three strong pillars, firstly managing and controlling misinformation [22], secondly use machine learning to automatically predicting the information (tweet) diffusion speed, scale, range and trend [23] and thirdly use frameworks to evaluate the credibility of a tweet, i.e. whether to trust the tweet and the person writing the tweet.",

However, as such, any literature or verbatim synopsis is already abstractive in nature and has very little possibility of reproduction of the original sentence. With all deep learning architectures getting noticed by researchers in the field of unstructured data, it has become a more practical option for any NLP analysis, researchers have begun to consider these frameworks as a fully data-driven alternative to abstractive text summarization. The possibility of storing the meaning of a sentence with abstract features extracted is not completely explored. In the latest research, Lopyrev [27] relates an application of an encoder-decoder RNN (recurrent neural network) with LSTM units and notices that the framework starts creating headlines from the actual text of news articles. In a slightly different but related work, Rush [28] presented a fully data-driven framework for sentence summarization. His approach makes use of an attention driven algorithm that creates each word from the input sentence as summary transformed. Chopra [29] proposes a constraint-based RNN (recurrent neural network) which can easily create an abstract of any input phrase. The transformation has been done by a unique approach in which a convolutional encoder is implemented to make sure that the corresponding decoder centers around the proper input words at each phase of generation. In an alternate paper that sharply resonates with our proposed framework, Ramesh Nallapati [30] has proposed a summary-based text abstraction using Attentional Encoder-Decoder RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), and show that these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on two different corpora [31\u201333]. Our work starts with a similar-looking framework but with the focus of extracting and storing the original sense of a sentence (tweets on Twitter) in very abstract features (CWWE) and assigning custom weights which will be further used to predict the diffusion (retweet) of the same sentences (tweets on Twitter).",
