COVID-19 is spread by droplets from talking, sneezing, or coughing and hand contact. Physicians from almost all specialties, including ophthalmologists, have died from COVID-19 during their patient care duties.1 Slit lamp breath shields are recommended to decrease the risk of possible infection to the examiner,2 and numerous commercial and home-fabricated slit lamp breath shields are available.3\n,\n4 Despite their pervasive use, we did not find a formal study on the efficacy of slit lamp breath shields. In this study, we test and compare the performance of six commercially available breath shield designs and one breath shield repurposed from a plastic container lid in protecting examiners against respiratory droplets using a spray gun sneeze simulation.",

On April 15th, 2020 the search terms \u201cslit lamp breath shield\u201d, \u201cbreath shield\u201d, and \u201cophthalmology\u201d were used to survey the English language literature on Google Scholar, PubMed and MEDLINE (Ovid). Articles from all years were searched. The Michael Garron Hospital Research Ethics Board (REB) deemed the study REB exempt. We complied with all ethical research principles compatible with the Declaration of Helsinki, although no human experimentation was involved. Five different commercially available polyethylene terephthalate slit lamp breath shields were purchased online from ChinRestPaperSource, Hillsboro, OR: Reichert and Keeler (AMBC2P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), Haag-Streit Regular (AMBC4P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), Haag-Streit Improved (AMBC5P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), Universal Small (AMBUS1P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), and Universal Large (AMBUL1P Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR). The breath shields were chosen based on popularity using the website reviews. The largest commercially available breath shield we found, the \u201cZombie Shield,\u201d (AMBUZ, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), was also the most expensive, and has been advertised for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.5 Prior to the pandemic, conventional breath shields were much smaller than this size. Due to budget constraints, we simulated the dimensions of the sixth shield from cardboard. A seventh shield design was a repurposed disposable plastic salad container lid and had edges that curved towards the examiner at roughly 35o.",

The cardboard slit lamp model was placed at the appropriate distance and height from the spray gun, and white poster paper was positioned directly behind the oculars of the cardboard slit lamp model to catch any overspray. The cardboard phantom was sprayed without a breath shield to establish our baseline control area of spray. The measurement was repeated three times, each time using a new piece of poster paper. Then each breath shield was placed at its intended position, either on the objective lens arm or hanging off the oculars and tested three times. Figure 1\nshows the cardboard slit lamp and spray bottle setup. The area of spray was photographed immediately after the spray (Figure 2\n). Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Inc., Mountain View, California) was used to determine the surface area of the green colorant. The color range function and Euclidean distances were used to calculate differences within the color space.8 Any gravitational leakage of the colorant after the initial spray impression was accounted for. The average surface area from all three sets was calculated for each breath shield (see Table 1\n).",

Although larger shields may offer better protection, they may also impede access to slit lamp controls. A curved design such as in the repurposed plastic salad lid may protect the examiner from eccentric sneezes. There are a myriad of other breath shield designs available3 and we did not have the resources to manufacture or test each one.",

Ideally the patient and physician should both have face masks during the slit lamp exam, but when there is a shortage of PPE, the breath shields become even more important. As each slit lamp may be unique, the study results from the average dimensions of our cardboard phantom may not apply to other bio microscopes. We only simulated a straight-ahead spray; in reality, patients may sneeze at angles not blocked by the shield or slit lamp. Additionally, our spray velocity was 2m/s, but sneezes can achieve a velocity of 35 m/s (126 km/h)7. There was some variation in the spray measurements which we tried to minimize with three serial tests. We also could not quantify the volume of the overspray, which might correspond with the viral load - only the area. This is a limitation of the usage of imagery to capture the amount of overspray, as Adobe Photoshop cannot quantify the volume of water on the poster paper. Finally, we cannot account for the effects of microdroplets and aerosolization, which have been suggested as possible routes of transmission of COVID-19. Microdroplets are spread during a regular conversation and can rise high in the air and circulate well beyond the breath shield to reach the examiner.18 The COVID-19 virus has been shown to stay viable in aerosols for at least 3 hours under experimental conditions in a Goldberg drum.19\n",
