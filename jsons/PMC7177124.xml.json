In an ideal situation, in which telemedicine can be phased in over a longer period, patient attitudes and technological abilities can be assessed through focus group discussions [31] and/or surveys. [25, 63] The purpose of such tools is to determine patient desires and motivations for their care, experience with telemedicine and technology, and health literacy levels. Areas of focus include reasons patients come to the clinic, barriers to traveling to the clinic, patient comfort with and access to technology, patient experience and/or comfort with telemedicine, and patient comfort and trust with receiving instructions through digital communications. [13, 17, 23, 25, 41, 47, 66] Patients with greater health literacy and engagement are more likely to embrace telemedicine. [42, 51] Quantitative and qualitative data can reveal areas where patient education and support are needed.",

Requirements for reimbursement included that the patient be located in a designated \u201crural health professional shortage area,\u201d a county not part of metropolitan area, or a facility participating in a Federal Telemedicine Demonstration Project. [60] Low-resource or underfunded institutions outside such areas did not qualify for telemedicine reimbursement. [29] These limitations prevented the use of telemedicine for most patients. In contrast, the Veterans Health Administration operates the nation\u2019s largest telemedicine program and offers free telemedicine to all patients enrolled in their insurance program. [62] Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine varies by state, with some states providing full reimbursement with no restrictions, and others imposing restrictions similar to those of Medicare. [30, 39] Private insurers have various reimbursement plans, based on local coverage determinations for a given payer. State mandates for private insurance reimbursement for telemedicine services, in some cases irrespective of rural or non-rural setting, have resulted in expansion of telemedicine coverage. [39]",

Telemedicine was used for new patients, as well as established patients.

The patient education typically provided before TJA can also be accomplished through interactive telemedicine.
