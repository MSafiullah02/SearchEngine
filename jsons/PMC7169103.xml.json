Therefore, although CT scan is usually not necessary for the diagnosis of CAP, it was used in the majority of CAP patients treated at our institution, which allowed us to determine the proportion of patients with NP. Therefore, these facts are likely to reduce the possibility that patients who underwent CT scan had more severe disease.

In the present study, NP was demographically characterized by a higher number of males, ever\u2010smokers and heavy drinkers, and was more commonly associated with post\u2010gastrectomy status, chronic liver disease and diabetes. This is consistent with a previous review that reported alcoholism and diabetes as common co\u2010morbid conditions commonly accompanying NP.2 The duration of symptoms in the NP group was significantly longer than that in the non\u2010NP group, suggesting that delayed treatment could facilitate necrotizing changes.",

However, in the present study, these clinical features of NP were not associated with 30\u2010day or in\u2010hospital mortality, which suggests that NP severity perse does not increase the risk of mortality. In the same context, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy and clinical deterioration rates were similar in the two groups. Interestingly, the two clinical prediction scoring systems showed conflicting results; median PSI class was higher in the NP group but median CURB\u201065 scores were similar in both groups. In fact, LOS was the only clinical endpoint that allowed to differentiate the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that necrotizing changes independently predicted LOS. The longer LOS observed in the NP group could be explained as follows: (i) more severe inflammation, reflected by higher blood levels of inflammatory markers; (ii) impaired blood supply to the pulmonary parenchyma, leading to impediment of antibiotic delivery;2, 18, 19 and (3) more frequent association with complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema requiring pleural drainage.",

The most common microbe was K. pneumoniae, followed by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and S. milleri group. These findings corresponds with those of other studies, in which S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were common in patients with severe NP requiring surgical intervention.1, 4, 23, 24 The rates of potentially drug\u2010resistant pathogens were similar in our NP and non\u2010NP groups in the present study.",

First, it is limited by its retrospective design and because it was conducted in a single institution, the possibility of selection bias has to be considered. Furthermore, because some CAP patients were treated at other departments in our institution, not all CAP patients were enrolled in the present study, and not all CAP patients underwent enhanced CT scan, although many (74%) did. Second, no microbiological study was performed on anaerobes from lung tissues or aspirates, and thus, the possibility that anaerobes were not identified as causative agents should be considered. Moreover, due to the retrospective nature of this study, all patients did not undergo the same tests for the aetiological agents, including atypical pathogens. Finally, decisions regarding treatment including antibiotics depended on attending physicians. For these reasons, we acknowledge that a larger prospective study should be undertaken to confirm our findings.",
