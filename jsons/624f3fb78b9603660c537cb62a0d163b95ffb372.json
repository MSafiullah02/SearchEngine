The condition of this patient met the criteria of severe CAP 3 and needed the supports of ventilator and vasopressor. Although his lymphocyte count increased on illness Day 20, indicating the decline of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, 4 this patient still died of subsequent infections with CnSKA. In previous reports, the replication of influenza virus damaged the pulmonary epithelial cells which expose attachment sites for bacterial invasion and impairs bacterial clearance from the respiratory tract. 5 The same is true for respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus are common co-pathogens for viral pneumonia. 5 Concurrent bacteremic pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae was reported in an influenza victim. 7 The complication of secondary bacterial infections has been one of the major causes of influenza-associated death. 5 The increased risk for secondary bacterial infections may be related to lymphopenia in more than 80% of reported COVID-19 patients. 2 This presented patient had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, both are factors for severe COVID-19 illness and Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. 9 Above 60% of critically ill COVID-19 patients developed ARDS and needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and the old age and comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were predisposing factors. 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae accounts for up to 17% of community-acquired pneumonia in Taiwan and 10-29% of ventilator-associated pneumonia in various countries. 10 Klebsiella pneumonia generally presents with fulminant course and has poor prognosis. Initial acute respiratory failure and septic shock were independent risk factors for early mortality. It is vital to study and to treat secondary bacterial infections, including resistant strains, that likely complicate the disease with an increased mortality.",

Three days after exposure in his cab, this No.19 case developed flu-like symptoms for the next 7 days. He subsequently transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to four of his relatives at a family dinner. However, the health-care workers were not infected by strict compliance with hospital infection prevention and control rule. Since the contacts were all isolated for 14 days, there was no further outbreak. It is urgent that SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for flu patients with severe illness.",

He went to clinic with fever and myalgia seven days later. He visited ED for progressive dyspnea and was admitted to ICU two days later. Intubation was done for ARDS and septic shock on the next day. Peramivir, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin were used initially and adjusted to ceftaroline and ciprofloxacin due to the positive culture of wild type KP. Clinical condition declined with desaturation, persistent fever, and increased infiltrates on CXR on hospital Day 5. Colistin was added and cetaroline was adjusted to teicoplanin to cover ventilator-associated pneumonia.The final culture of aspirates on hospital Day 12 grew CnSKA.
