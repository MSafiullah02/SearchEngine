Zinn (2008b) lists six main traditions, including risk society, cultural turn, and governmentality. One of the central problems that more recent work on risk has focused on is how risk varies according to the fabric of particular everyday lives in particular societies and under various types of social arrangements (Tulloch and Lupton, 2003; Tulloch, 2004) . In this chapter I explore this problem of risk theory by looking at the views Japanese young people have about risk in Japanese society.",

            "text": "In risk society theory, Ulrich Beck (1992; made his characteristic claim that risk enters as a second modernity. Yet, while the totalizing aspect of transition in risk society theory to a second or reflexive modernity has been treated by many sociologists with skepticism, risk society theorists have been able to claim, at least cautiously, that some notable change indeed has occurred globally with the rise of the possibility of catastrophic risk, symbolized by nuclear accidents and contamination, the worldwide transports of toxic wastes, and the rapid spread of diseases like AIDS, SARS, BSE, avian flu and other new viral infections that are spread easily by the globalization of food, migration of people and changes in environment due to human activities. In World Risk Society, for example, Beck (1999) states that a \"key question is how that model [of reflexive modernization] relates to the different modernities in other parts of the world\" (p. 2, italics in original). However, with few exceptions, for example a contribution to a special issue in Korea Journal (Beck, 1998) , he has had relatively little to say specifically about risk society in other parts of the world, a gap nonetheless filled by others with ethnographic perspectives drawn from a multiple set of sources (Caplan: 2000) . Although Beck's focus has often been Euro-or even German-centric, he has written that the rejection of \"radical otherness\" is \"an important standpoint in revising the evolutionary bias of much of the Western social sciences to this day.\" A defining aspect of risk developed in the context of analysis of South Korea, for example, will certainly contribute to understanding the global interconnectedness of risk as well as inform risk analysis and theorization in those parts of the world seen by many as prime initiators of risk and risk society, namely Western Europe and North America. There is a necessity, in short, \"not only to include non-Western societies into any analysis of the challenges of the world risk society but also to examine the specificities of the local refractions of the global-local risks in these societies\" (Beck, 1998, pp. 200-201) .",

Claims that Japan is not a risk society (Clammer:2002) or Japanese does not have the word risk (Douglas: 1992) , except for the katakana form of the English word in Japanese, 'risiku,' nothwithstanding, my claim in this chapter is that Japan is not only a country in which risk is now a commonplace, it is one in which ordinary Japanese have increasingly recognized risk in reflections on their daily lives over the past decade. 1 The research described below was carried out in this time frame but certainly risk has gained a new significance in Japanese society due to the nuclear contamination in Fukushima that followed the gigantic earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011.",

Here I can only allude to long debates regarding social science research on Japan as influenced either by Orientalism or Ninhonjin-ron (literally theories of the Japanese), drawing attention to the way that Japan and the Japanese have been portrayed, and in many cases portray their own society, as unique. I attempt in this chapter to show a local instantiation of risk, that is, in Japanese society in the past decade, while at the same time linking it to wider universalist discussions of the global risk in society.",

A number of the chapters in the anthropologically oriented book Risk Revisited (Caplan, 2000) do, in fact, theorize risk in local non-Western contexts and propose understandings of risk as well as challenge risk theory more generally. Such understandings contrast to the notion that. risk being discovered in the West in a global narrative of us and them which, while suggesting certain relations of power, through economy, technology, and industrial export (prime originators of global risk) are not well explicated, if at all. \"That risk should be elevated to the status of a defining feature of the age suggests \u2026 the prospect that as the West finds it more difficult to displace its crises onto others, it begins to adopt the posture of the beleaguered, out of control in a manner previously assigned to inhabitants of the periphery\" (Nugent, 2000, p. 246) .",

The Japanese government has customarily cloaked its international political agenda in the shadow of its half century long military and political alliance with the U.S., and Japanese citizens have developed highly individualized consumer lifestyles (automobility, fast food, hip hop and pop music, and Hollywood movies, etc.) that are generally agreed by many Japanese to be a benign (or at least inevitable) aspect of globalization. In his 1994 acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in literature, titled \"Ambiguous Japan and Myself\" [Aimai na Nihon to Watashi], Oe Kenzaburo reiterated the enduring problem of a political (as well as social and cultural) identity for Japan, as part of Asia but looking toward the West, particularly the U.S (Oe, 1994) . 2 On the one hand the \"uncertainty of self,\" (Tamamoto, 1999) that has been at the root of the identity of ordinary Japanese in modernity, and has been expressed by many commentators, particularly since the lost decade of the 1990s and afterwards (Miyazaki, 2010 ; see also Brinton, 2010 for a discussion of the \"lost generation\"), has become more attenuated over time, while on the other hand, successive waves of neoliberal government strategies have contributed to objectifying the sense of unease of all but the most financially secure of Japanese citizens. It is not simply a question that risk society has \"come\" to Japan as it has to other countries of East Asia, like China (Thiers, 2004) , along with the realization on the part of most ordinary citizens that their elected government is unable and some cases deliberately declining to address the problem of increased risk being offloaded from the realm of central bureaucratic management into the lives of individuals. Various domains of public policy have been increasingly subjected to management that obviously manipulates risk in favor of social preferences biased in favor of neoliberal capitalism and privatization. This can be clearly seen in educational policy where an earlier narrative of Japan as a rather successful global leader is increasingly submerged by Japan as a nation at risk (Takayama, 2007; Willis, et al, 2008) .",

The result, based on her linkage of risk to political mobilization, is a claim that societal problems which involve phenomena based on risk perceptions and definitions in other societies can be solved in a much more straightforward manner in Japan, i.e., relying on the bureaucracy to sort things out, relegate blame, and impose its will. Clammer (2001:40) had argued in a similar manner that Japan has been \"characterized by low levels of individualization,\" which, combined with the strong power of bureaucracies, means that solutions to or mobilizations around problems that might otherwise be labeled and politicized as risk do not often make their way into the public arena in Japan.",

The question of how media mediate risk is one that has been undertheorized in Beck's work, as critiqued by a range of scholarship (Boyne, 2003; Mythen, 2004 , Van Loon, 2002 . As pointed out by many of these critiques, media portrayal of risk is not as straightforward as might first appear. Mythen's (2004) discussion, in particular, of media reliance on government and institutionalized scientific sources, as well as the political economy of media itself, is important in illustrating the difficulties of bringing popular attention to a particular issue which in turn helps to shape risk perception. Van Loon (2002) makes the strongest case for the virtual mediation of images of risk, which he calls a \"crisis of actualization\" (p. 155) noting that what gains attention is only \"panic ecology\" (p. 163). Boyne uses the phrase \"emotional spectacularization\" (p. 40) to describe the way media capitalizes on the \"tension [which] is between analysing risk and creating an appetite for its images\" (p. 35).",

From my many years of teaching, it has long surprised me how few Japanese university students profess to reading a newspaper, watching the news on television, or accessing a news site through the internet. This certainly has a bearing on how risk can and should be defined in order to operationalize research on perceptions about it. While university students were a target of opportunity, I also hypothesized that, among the larger population of Japanese youth, they would tend to have higher interest in issues defined as risk. In the next section, I briefly delineate several cases prior to the events of March 11, 2011, that show risk in Japan and how media interacted with them.",

The second and third cases were confirmed in November and December in different regions of Japan, while the fourth and fifth cases were confirmed in May of 2002. By the fall of 2004, the number of confirmed cases in Japan had risen to 15. The story was then complicated by the first discovery in 2003 of BSE in the U.S., a major exporter of beef to Japan, subsequently leading to the ban of imports of U.S. beef. Shortly before the remaining stocks of cheap American beef in Japan were consumed, TV cameras showed long lines of customers queuing in order to eat the last dishes of gyudon, a dish made from beef and rice, at a low-cost fast food chain. While many consumers expressed anxiety over the quality of beef, many others wanted to get their last beef bowl before the ban went into effect. The ban was rescinded in 2006 at which time more than thirty cases had been identified, and except for the occasional flap over imports from the U.S. with banned parts (e.g. bovine spinal columns) American beef sales have resumed in the Japanese market.",

For example, in September 1999, Japan experienced its heretofore worst ever nuclear accident, in which 69 people were exposed to high levels of radiation, two workers were killed, and another was seriously injured. This was just one of a series of similar types of accidents and fires that have occurred at nuclear processing facilities and plants around Japan since its introduction into Japan in the 1980s. What was different in this case was the discovery of a bootleg manual that instructed the workers how to make nuclear fuels by mixing uranium oxide with nitric acid using a stainless steel container instead of the usual mixing apparatus. Apparently this method was a way to cheapen the process and had been in use for several years. In the summer of 2004, a new accident at a nuclear facility in Fukui claimed the lives of four workers as pipes which had badly deteriorated after 28 years of use exploded with boiling water. Once again the ritualized scene of government officials bowing in public and claiming responsibility was broadcast on Japanese TV, but it seems clear that fewer and fewer Japanese people find such public displays trustworthy indicators of institutional responsibility.",

While it is clear that Japanese young people have some strong understandings of risk, risk-taking, and risk in society, it is also the case that further research would be necessary to explore why they adopt rather fatalistic viewpoints towards the problems of knowledge of risk in Japanese society. A governmental approach would suggest that they are strongly convinced of the power of media to control ordinary people (particularly those other than themselves) while maintaining that they are able to pierce the veil of consciousness regarding the mystification of real and perceived risks. On the other hand a cultural approach would acknowledge that the researcher empowered students to talk about risk claims as knowledgeable subjects in an arena in which knowledge is at least of nominal importance. University students are certainly likely to have different views of risk than 18-year-old graduates of high school who are doing industrial work or part-time jobs. While individual responses to changing employment risk and uncertainty are seen by many young people as a matter of personal volition, their choices are greatly structured by class considerations or \"risk divides,\" insecurity for many, tradable skills for the lucky and privileged few (Allen and Henry, 1997; Ekinsmyth, 1999; Evans, et. al, 2001; Furlong and Cartmel, 2007) .",

            "text": "More generally, however, at least two divergent scenarios are possible to picture based on the results in this research. One is that risk becomes further normalized through media representation as do-it-yourself responses to one crisis following another. Lash (2002) writes about this as the network society \"re-stabilizes the risks of Beck's (1992) risk society partly by calculatingly colonizing -through for example futures markets -the future\" (p. 127). He points to the possibility for ordinary citizens to become \"arbitrageurs\" of risk, personally accepting those they feel comfortable with and can profit from/with while rejecting those that they fear or dislike. This seemed to be partly indicated by some of the results of this research in which many students saw themselves as interested in risk in contrast to other students around them. Such a relation to risk most closely resembles what Crook (1999) calls a \"neo-liberal risk management regime,\" one in which management is largely dependent on \"self-regulating capacities of individuals.\" As such, the \"neo-liberal risk management constantly threatens to de-legitimize itself because it delivers the risk without the management\" (p. 181).",

            "text": "The second scenario is that through risk consciousness, young people in Japan would become more interested in social issues, advocacy, and change. This would correspond to the hope of analysts including Strydom (2002) who argues that our realization that we now live in experimenting societies can be the impetus to new social and political formations. But in order for that to happen, a much deeper questioning of the link between capitalism and technoscience needs to take place, one in which the entrepreneurial fixes to risk are challenged as \"a new form of class conflict.\" While there was cursory evidence among the university students I researched of such consciousness developing, the events of the past year and ongoing problems of nuclear contamination suggest that a large portion of Japanese people are ready to challenge the normative understandings of risk presented by the nuclear industry scientists and pro-nuclear politicians. The relation between risk understandings generated by ordinary young people, as reported in the media, and media which can be used to further understanding of risk (and here it is important to include new media) is one that will be of great importance as Japanese try to understand the damages that have been afflicted on the northeast region of the country, due to the March 11 earthquake and its aftermath, and what significance these understandings have for building a more open, transparent and responsive political system that addresses the many risks that Japan faces in the future.",
