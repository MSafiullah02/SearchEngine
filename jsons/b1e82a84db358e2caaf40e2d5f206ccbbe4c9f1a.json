There are specific requirements in nontechnical 210 competencies for public health responders in CBRN events besides some common 211 competencies. Those identified competencies could be useful to develop a workforce for 212 CBRN emergencies, such as outlining competency-based training and updating job 213 description for recruitment. The proposed competency framework can be used to support 214 developers of public health emergency preparedness training initiatives by ensuring that 215 public health professionals are able to demonstrate the non-technical knowledge and skills 216 10 needed for successful performance when preparing and responding to CBRN incidents. It can 217 also help update and revise job descriptions, and orient public health practitioners to their 218 emergency roles and responsibilities. The changing practical context and requirements for 219 CBRN responses in the future demands the constant updating and redefining of the 220 competency framework. 221 DECLARATIONS 222 Ethical Considerations 223 This project was approved by the Ethics Committee of (author organization).

According to grounded theory, analysis occurred alongside data collection and 83 was able to inform the next interview and develop an emergent understanding of the themes 84 and findings. Substantive coding facilitated the process of theoretical sampling and directed 85 the evolution of the interview guide. As interviews were conducted and coded, the 86 competencies were revised iteratively. Theoretical sampling was done until the researchers 87 reached theoretical saturation. That is to say, when conducting more interviews would add 88 little value to the research, and data saturation was achieved, and the interviewing ceased. ",

Task management not only 164 directly affects response performances, which has been widely cited in previous literature 8, 9 , 165 but it also may have indirect influence by affecting other nontechnical competencies. Most of 166 interviewees indicated that having a good knowledge of professional task procedures and 167 standards is a type of fundamental nontechnical competency that can make contributions to better communication, collaboration and mental quality. This finding suggests and victims are continually under life threats from the CBRN contamination, 173 responders must take measures to protect airway, skin, and eyes before entering the 174 contaminated area, which is an unique and indispensable component of emergency response 22 . 175 Austere environment skills involving physical/psychological self-care are definitely perceived 176 as a priority for the CBRN public health responders since limitations to the use of personal 177 protective equipment (PPE) are restriction of physical activity, heat-related illness, 178 dehydration, and psychological effect. Most study participants started their discussions with 179 personal safety considerations and skills in a hot or warm zone, and psychological self-care 180 was also highlighted as essential for medical workers at high risk of suffering severe stress or 181 even anxiety disorders from the fear of CBRN hazards. In addition, overwhelming workloads 182 are frequently encountered by medical staff dressed in heavy PPE in austere hazardous 183 environments, where they encounter an influx of patients. In contrast to prior studies 9, 15, 19 , 184 physical stamina was frequently discussed in this study as a nontechnical competency that 185 makes a substantial contribution to response performance. qualitative study is subject to several limitations. The raw data were the expressed 189 opinions of a purposive sample of experts. While inclusion criteria for subjects was based on 190 their experience in the field of CBRN responses and their varying backgrounds, it is possible 191 that a potential source of bias in respondents exists. Secondly, the interpretivist framework raises questions about the validity of the findings and empirical generalizability of the study, 193 though validity checks on the coding and data analysis are allowed. Finally, this qualitative 194 study was intended to identify categories, not to quantify their relative importance to the 195 participants. 196 Further study should continue to identify and validate potential nontechnical competencies 197 using multiple approaches based a broader sample to explore the attributes of effective public 198 health responders in new CBRN emergencies. With the changing characteristics of CBRN 199 incidents, the competency framework should keep updating to match the emergent needs of 200 response and to advance the evolvement of workforce development processes. More efforts 201 are also needed to explore relative contribution of each nontechnical competency to the 202 comprehensive performance of public health responders, and relationship among those 203 competencies. Moreover, study could be conducted to further classify competencies by phases 204 of the CBRN management and to delineate levels of proficiency needed based upon 205 occupation. intensive care.
