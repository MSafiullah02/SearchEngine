The message type was verified, and medical advice requests 50 were reviewed independently by each author. Encounters where physicians managed the entire 51 patient complaint through the MyChart portal were considered as separate electronic E&M 52 services of the patient's concern utilizing the CMS guidelines and thus potentially eligible for 53 provider reimbursement. 54 55 There was a steady rise in patient-initiated MyChart encounters each year (Figure 1 ). Contact 56 hours and patient clinic encounters also rose during this same time period, but the rise in 57 messages outpaced the time spent in face-to-face care (Figure 2 ). In our sample, 58% of the 58 messages were medical advice requests and 30.75% of all messages met criteria for separate 59 E&M services via the portal.
