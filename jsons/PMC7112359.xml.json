All P values were calculated on the basis of 2-sided tests. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to model the log odds of asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory tract viral infections and to calculate estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs.32 All logistic models were tested for potential confounders (eg, age, season, and sex) and effect modifiers. The final models were adjusted for factors (eg, race/ethnicity) that were not collinear and confounded the \u03b2 coefficient for the association between the respiratory tract viral infections and asthma exacerbations by 10% or more. In addition, the final model included frequency-matched variables, such as age and season. All statistical procedures were performed with SAS version 8.2 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).",

The absence of influenza virus detections in our study can be explained by the shorter than usual duration of the 2003-2004 influenza season in the state of Georgia, which might have reduced its overall effect. According to the Georgia Division of Public Health surveillance data, the peak in influenza activity in the state was limited to a 3-week period in December (http://health.state.ga.us/epi/flu/fluupdall.asp). We might have missed influenza-positive children because of the small number of participants enrolled during the high-risk period (December enrollment, n = 8).",

Although there were certain differences in baseline characteristics between the case patients and control subjects (eg, by recent treatment, race/ethnicity, number of clinic visits, or hospitalizations for asthma in the past 12 months) that might have contributed to the differences in viral infection prevalence, none of these variables was significantly associated with rates of virus positivity and thus should not have confounded our findings.",
