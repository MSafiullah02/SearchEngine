When it infects the host cells it attaches to the receptors via GP glycoprotein and gets endocytosed in host vesicles. C-type lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR play crucial role as they bind to Ebola glycoproteins and augment infection. Ebola enters early endosomes via macropinocytosis. In culture cells like dendritic cells, GP glycoprotein modulates to GP1 due to action of Cathepsin L (Cat L) and Cathepsin B (Cat B). Upon GP1 interaction with host NPC1, fusion of virus and vesicle membrane happens. Ribonucleocapsid is released followed by transcription. Replication starts and nucleoprotein encapsidates newly synthetized genomes. There is interaction of ribonucleotide with matrix protein and then virions are released via budding from plasma membrane through ESCRT complexes.

Authors proposed that cloning and sequencing of NP and GP gene of Gabonese strains isolated from Ebola outbreak-1996 found circulating virus in Zaire subtype Ebola strain. GP and NP were synthesized in Sf9 cells and expressed as recombinant proteins to develop ELISA for the detection of IgG antibodies in convalescent human sera from Gabon and Zaire. All the measurements were made using 50 ng of antigen in each well of ELISA plate. NP and GP based ELISA method detected IgG and IgM antibodies successfully and could be used for early diagnosis. However this assay showed issues of false result. Thus developing a selective method to detect EBOV at clinical level was in demand (Prehaud et al., 1998). A sandwich ELISA system based on EBOV antigen-detection using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) prepared via immunization of NP (Zaire subtype) was developed (Niikura et al., 2001). This developed system detected 30 ng of recombinant NP. The utilized Mab was also found reacting with corresponding region of NP derived from the Reston and Sudan subtypes. Researchers claimed that this system can be used at laboratories to detect Ebola virus at very low level (Niikura et al., 2001).",

(2006) proposed ELISA and RT-PCR based detection of Ebola virus in oral fluid during the Ebola-outbreak 2003 hemorrhagic fever (EVHF) in the Republic of Congo (Formenty et al., 2006). They used serum and oral fluid specimens of 24 Ebola virus infected patients along with 10 normal patients and confirmed EVHF. In this study, author failed to detect IgG against Ebola in oral fluid sample of patients whose serum samples were seropositive. Besides this, patients with positive serum, RT-PCR results were also found positive in oral fluid specimens (Formenty et al., 2006). An ELISA assay was developed by Nakayama et al. (2010) to detect filovirus species-specific antibodies. His-tagged, a secreted form of the transmembrane GPs of five different EBOV species was used as an antigen for the detection filovirus species specific antibodies. An assay was performed on antisera collected from mice immunized with virus-like particles and from humans and nonhuman primates infected with virus. A little cross-reactivity of IgG antibodies was observed in most of the mouse antisera. Results suggest that virus specific IgM antibodies were specifically detected in acute infected patients and developed method could be of use for Ebola diagnostics and management (Nakayama et al., 2010).",

It is well known that during infection a little change take place in nucleotide or amino acid sequences of GP Ebola virus of any subtypes in comparison of uninfected original representatives. Such nonstructural secreted GP and SGP was successfully detected at acute infection in humans (Sanchez et al. 1999). Additionally, RT-PCR method to detect and quantify RNA of Ebola and Marburg Viruses, Lassa Virus, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, Dengue Virus, and Yellow Fever Virus was developed by Drosten et al 2002 (Drosten et al. 2002). These mentioned diseases are clinically difficult to detect, diagnose, and screen out. Novel primers and 5-nuclease detection probes were designed for specific related virus using DNA database entries. Assay sensitivity for all measurement was optimized and validated using an in vitro-transcribed RNA. A detection limit of >95% was estimated using probit regression analysis and average measurement time was within 3 hrs after receiving samples of patient.

Authors developed an assay based on galactosidase (lacZ), a reporter gene in target cell for the detection of cytoplasmic exchanges which is an indication of membrane fusion with EBOV infected cell (Zaire species) (\nFig. 15). The outcomes of this study demonstrated the direct role of EBOV in progression and inhibition by anti-GP IgG (Bar et al. 2006). Kurosaki-2007 et al developed a one-step reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect Zaire EBOV via targeting trailer region of the viral genome (Kurosaki et al. 2007). This reported assay detected 20 copies of artificial Zaire EBOV RNA within 26 mins. Real time-monitoring detection was also performed to detect 10\u22123 FFU of propagated virus. RT-LAMP assay is found selective to Zaire EBOV. At good side, this method does not need sophisticated instrumentation and seems suitable for EBOV diagnosis at clinics and in-field (Kurosaki et al. 2007).",

Besides this, Mab was also able to recognize and differentiate EBOV GP among human and non-human primates. Both immunosensor strategy were found selective (Yu et al., 2006). Recently, a paper based synthetic gene network was investigated by Pardee et al. (2014) to detect EBOV (\nFig. 16) (Pardee et al., 2014). Authors explored an in-vitro paper-based platform which is capable of detecting virus smartly using engineered gene circuits and visual transduction. Small-molecule and RNA actuation of genetic switches, rapid prototyping of complex gene circuits, and programmable in vitro diagnostics, including glucose sensors and strain-specific EBOV sensors has been successfully demonstrated using this approach. This test method is very rapid, cost-effective, sensitive (2.5\u20133.53), and performed detection and diagnostics based on antibody or sequences.

Further ELISA is difficult to perform at POC facility, while RT-PCR is complicated by genetic diversity due to rapidly changing nature of the genomic sequence of the virus. Further, these methods are limited to laboratory only. Thus the turn-around time for a confirmed laboratory Ebola diagnostics results is about 3 days and this causes delay in therapeutic approaches.",

However, longer detection time, traveling with biosample is still an obstacle. However, both testing method are based on sophisticated device and demand need of high expertize in performing test. Experts explained both good and bad side of these devices but also due to rapid and on-site detection they recommend this method for screening tool at POC in remote area. Experts believe that, once optimized, Senova could potentially produce thousands of sensing unit per day and assay-cost would be $1 or $2 each. Recently, WHO, USAID, and Gates foundation has funded various programs to promote research for the development of new diagnostic methods to improve state-of-the-art of Ebola diagnostics.

Recently these sensors are being integrated with microfluidic systems (sample automation) and miniaturized devices for POC target analyte detection (Cruz et al., 2014; Kaushik et al., 2014a,\n2014b; Vasudev et al., 2013). However, this methodology is not yet explored for EVD. We at College of Medicine and College of engineering of FIU propose that development of a POC system consists of an electrochemical Ebola imunosensor fabricated using a specific monoclonal antibody can detect Ebola virus as low as pM levels within \u223c40 min compared to 3 days of ELISA test at nM levels. If developed, such devices can be used for rapid screening of Ebola strains using available specific Anti-Ebola virus antibodies based immunosensing and can also estimate Ebola virus levels enabling a faster therapeutic approach.",

A dose of respiratory and sublingual 1.4 \u00d7 109 infectious virus particles (ivp)/kg of Ad-CAGoptZGP strongly induced the response of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell specifically to EBOV GP antibodies. This vaccine was investigated in three primates and showed improved immune response to Ebola in rodents. Significantly, such formulated vaccine exhibited protection against challenge, 21 weeks after immunization. However, in case of sublingual, the developed antibodies were unable to neutralize that makes vaccine un-protective (Choi et al., 2014). The role of humoral versus cellular immunity in recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine for the protection against Zaire strain EBOV has been investigated using a model of EBOV infected animals (Marzi et al., 2014). The developed rVSV-Zaire Ebola GP vaccine was tested in groups of cynomolgus macaques depleted of CD4+T, CD8+T, or CD20+B cells. Detailed analysis of the results suggested that the role of antibodies was crucial for rVSV-based vaccine therapeutics against EBOV infection (Marzi et al., 2014). Mohan et al explored the phenomena of antigenic subversion, a novel EBOV escape strategy via improving host immunity (Mohan et al., 2012). Authors reported that DNA immunized GP1, 2 and/or truncated glycoprotein isoform (sGP) and among them only sGP has ability to compete with anti-GP1 2 antibodies. sGP is secreted during EBOV infection and it quantity has correlated with virus progression. Authors correlated outcomes with EBOV vaccinology and claimed its importance to elicit immunity for rapid clearing of EBOV infection before antigenic subversion. Antigenic subversion represents a novel virus escape strategy that likely helps EBOV evade host immunity, and may represent an important obstacle to EBOV vaccine design (Mohan et al., 2012).",

An effective EVD monitoring and treatment demands for the establishment of BSL-4 level laboratories internationally to explore more fundamental and applied research in EBOV for development of effective diagnostics system. As of now, enough tools to prevent EBOV transmission, pathogenesis, replication, and health effects are being explored. RNA/protein, ELISA, immunofluorescent assays, RT/Q-PCR, disposable immunoassays, SPR, and QCM based Ebola detection are serving good at clinical level only for recognition and detection of EBOV. Unfortunately, random false results exhibited by these methods are still unsolved issues. However, smart miniaturized and POC Ebola sensing devices or diagnostic kits are not explored yet for selective rapid detection of EBOV level need for timely therapeutics.",

            "text": "Thus, developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EBOV at POC will be worth exploring. This can possibly be achieved using electrochemical immunosensing methodology. Nano-electronics and nanoplatform based electrochemical immunosensors based miniaturized devices are capable of detecting target analytes (pM level) at clinics and at disease location. The integration of such miniaturized sensing devices with me NEMS/MEMS is also increasing for automation of sample and for accurate and precise measurement. We hypothesize that development of specific Ebola monoclonal antibody based electrochemical immunosensor can detect EBOV selectively at pM level within \u223c40 min. These devices can be used for rapid screening and estimation of EBOV level especially at early stage. The investigation of miniaturized potentiostat for rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of EBOV at POC will help to decide the therapeutic decision of Ebola infected patients. Moreover, rapid assessment of EBOV using miniaturized electrochemical ebola sensing systems will improve the EBOV progression and personalized health care of patients (\nFig. 26). In future a fully optimized POC Ebola sensing device can be used for on-site diagnostics of infected patients. This would be of great importance to decide therapeutics.",

An impactful research has been conducted to explore the strategies to control the transmission and epidemic. Efforts have also been made to improve detection performance of Ebola diagnostic tools in particular to achieve rapid and selective detection to decide therapies. The challenge of discrimination among symptoms of Ebola and other deadly fever like malaria and diarrhea is remain unresolved and raise the demand to develop highly sensitive diagnostic tools at early stage. The available diagnostic tools are capable of detecting Ebola virus concentration but the longer analysis time and portability limit their applications in field. According to SOA of miniaturized sensing technology, POC Ebola detection can be achieved via adopting electrochemical Ebola immunosensing methodologies. This review is a request to initiate high level multidisciplinary research in collaboration of biologist, nanotechnologist, and engineers to developed smart compartments to integrate POC Ebola sensing devices in BSL-4 environment. The successful demonstration of Ebola sensing devices in-field for Ebola virus detection at pM level within 30 minutes in all virus strain at diseases site to decide therapeutics should be the aim of future research approach.",
