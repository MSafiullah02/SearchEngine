In 2000, the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation introduced a new community-based service called Health-In-Action, based on the blueprint of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) developed at Stanford University [3]. Different from health education and promotion services for chronic diseases, the CDSMP assists participants in developing self-efficacy and self-management behaviors to manage their illnesses.

During group sessions, participants are guided to experience and master self-management behavior (enactive mastery experiences) [4], [5]. Participants learn to set realistic self-management goals with a \u201cjust-right challenge\u201d; that is, goals that participants feel 70% confident they will complete. The leaders act as role models in self-management, providing a source of vicarious experience. The progress of participants toward the goals is monitored by peers through weekly reviews, sharing, and group problem-solving. Through self-paced practice with different self-management behaviors, participants gradually acquire self-management skills and improve efficacy in managing their illness. In the long run, persistent application of self-management behaviors is expected to help them achieve better mental and physical health and decrease health-care utilization.",

Unlike previous studies, we used a 7-week time frame to study the short-term effects of the CDSMP, and we included a measure of coping strategies as a short-term outcome of the program. We wanted to capture the short-term effects of the CDSMP in this manner for several reasons. First, it was important to identify how far the effects of the CDSMP could be consolidated and maintained over a 6-month period [6], [9], although their validity could be threatened by using an extended time window of 6 months because of the effects of history and maturation [10]. It is difficult to attribute 6-month outcomes to participation in a 6-week CDSMP program, since participants in community-based programs may be subjected to various intervening influences within a 6-month time frame.",

Hong Kong, on the other hand, is a place where \u201cEast meets West,\u201d having been a British colony for 99 years (up to 1997) but having a population mostly made up of Chinese (95%). Public health services mainly deliver Western medicine, although Chinese medicine and alternative medicine (including Tai-Chi) are widely accepted and practiced. It would be of interest to examine how well the CDSMP, an intervention developed in Western cultures, is received by people in Hong Kong. The empirical results of this study could provide valuable information on the application of the program to Chinese populations. However, in doing this, we made no changes to the content of the original program. We instead merely translated the program content into Cantonese (the language spoken in Hong Kong). Our intention was to explore to what extent the CDSMP was culturally relevant when applied to a Chinese population. Third, we know from the literature on rehabilitation counseling that changes in coping strategies (such as cognitive reappraisal) are an important mechanism underlying adjustment to illness and disability [14]. We hypothesized that changes in coping strategies were possible precursors to changes in longer-term outcomes of the CDSMP, and we added this measure to strengthen the design of the study.",

Second, the CDSMP group used significantly more types of cognitive methods (e.g., relaxation, guided imagery, positive thinking) than did the comparison group to manage disease symptoms like pain and discomfort. On the whole, the results suggest that the CDSMP was effective in helping participants acquire self-management behaviors with respect to cognitive-symptom management and exercise by the end of the 6-week program. In fact, these two types of self-management behavior were the ones most commonly seen in the participants\u2019 action plans, as reported in their daily logs. Third, we noticed some measurement issues with the two self-management subscales of \u201cuse of community services\u201d and \u201ccommunication with physician.\u201d Participants\u2019 report on the \u201cuse of community services\u201d subscale could depend on individual needs as well as awareness and availability of neighborhood resources. For the \u201ccommunication with physician\u201d subscale, participants reported in their logs much dissatisfaction in communicating with health professionals. Many said they could do little on their part, and some even said that physicians needed to improve their communication skills. In short, the \u201cuse of community resources\u201d subscale may be dropped as its reliability is in question. There is also a need to further explore the difficulties in communication with health-care professionals and to use the information to re-design the questions in this subscale, as well as addressing this issue in the program content.",

Many chronic diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, are characterized by a recurring pattern of exacerbation and remission of symptoms. It is possible that clients may not perceive significant decreases in pain and physical comfort as a whole. The more immediate benefit of the self-management interventions probably lies in helping clients to perceive more control over their illness and lives, and to apply more effective self-management strategies [14].",

First, participants were rather ambivalent about topics related to death and dying. Many were reluctant to discuss the topic of advanced directives and dismissed it as unnecessary. On the other hand, quite a number of participants requested more coverage of suicide and dying. They said that many persons with chronic illness think of ending their own lives some time in the course of their illness. Second, many participants expressed great dissatisfaction in their communication with health-care professionals, especially physicians.

As reflected in the results, we found that Tai-Chi in a mass-activity format primarily resulted in an increase in exercising and in the use of coping strategies of hope and prayer, but not in the other outcome domains we measured.

During this period, people were very afraid to leave home, and many tried to avoid social contact as much as possible. People with chronic illness were advised by the Health Department that they were more vulnerable to SARS than the general public, which decreased the feasibility of conducting the follow-up assessment. Thus, the nature of this study was reframed as a short-term evaluation of the CDSMP.

In addition, we also noticed that many participants set self-management goals in practicing cognitive methods. These results support the notion that the practice and application of cognitive methods by participants played an important part in the change processes of the CDSMP. While many Chinese patients may begin their self-management plans by exercising, health-care practitioners should note the importance of teaching cognitive methods as a major coping strategy.",

The results suggested that the effects of the CDSMP for Chinese populations were largely similar to those for other ethnic groups. There were, however, two aspects of the program that may need further review. Participants were ambivalent toward the topics of death, dying, and suicide, and interested in learning more about communicating with health professionals. Health-care practitioners should note the taboo associated with discussions of death and dying in Chinese populations, and assist patients to learn communication and assertive skills when talking with their doctors.",
