On the other hand, it should be noted that over the last thirty years of systematic investigation of ANPs, there are dozens of other therapeutically attractive structures synthesized but never advanced to the stage of preclinical/clinical investigations.5 These structures are namely a) antiretroviral purine 3-fluoro-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivatives,6 b) acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with 5-azacytosine base moiety,7 c) 6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkoxy]-2,4-diaminopyrimidines (\u201copen-ring\u201c derivatives)8, 9, 10 and d) aza/deaza analogues of purine [(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl] derivatives.11\n",

They are evidently mimics of the appropriate 2,6-diaminopurine derivatives with an open imidazole ring. Their antiviral activity is essentially identical to that of their parent compounds, including the enantiomeric specificity. Compounds as PMEO-DAPy, (R)-PMPO-DAPy and 5-substituted PMEO-DAPy (Fig. 1\n) are very efficient inhibitors of retroviruses8, 9, 10 and HBV. Despite the number of antiretroviral drugs currently available on the market, further investigation of new structures is advisable for several reasons: 1) the risk of emergence of resistance, 2) none of the known drugs is able to eradicate HIV infection completely, 3) no vaccination are yet available, 4) early development of new drug candidates is necessary due to the longtime process lasting from in vitro laboratory testing to clinical phases and final approval. Moreover, there is an additional reason to focus on open-ring analogs of the PMEO-DAPy type: they are incorporated more efficiently than (R)-PMPA (tenofovir) by the K65R HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) mutant and they are not as efficiently excised as (R)-PMPA by the HIV-1 RT containing thymidine analog mutations.12 Additionally, PMEO-DAPy is active not only against retroviruses but also against DNA viruses, especially herpesviruses, which often affect immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS.",

The prodrug hexadecyloxyethyl ester of its cyclic form (HDE-cHPMP-5-azaC) revealed the most potent anti-DNA virus activities and also the highest selectivity indices (ratio activity vs toxicity) in the order of thousands, e.g. 1160 for herpes simplex virus (HSV) \u2265 5800 for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and \u226524,600 for HCMV.14 The only disadvantage of HPMP-5-azaC is its complicated metabolic profile bound to instability of the 5-azacytosine ring in alkaline conditions including physiological pH. Studying the stability of various 5-azacytosine ANPs, we found much better stability for another 5-azacytosine derivative, i.e. 1-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-5-azacytosine (PME-5-azaC).15 Despite the fact that its antiviral activity was only marginal in the free phosphonic acid form 7, we selected the compound for syntheses and further studies of its prodrug forms. We considered the fact that the activities of many ANPs were increased after transformation to appropriate prodrugs. Moreover, in some cases not only the activity was enhanced but also the spectrum of activity could be broaden by transformation to prodrugs. Typical examples are the anti-DNA viral agents 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (HPMPA) whose octadecyloxyethyl (ODE) ester is a potent and selective inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication16 or cidofovir transformed to its hexadecyloxyethyl ester (brincidofovir) whose efficacy is also enlarged to some RNA viral infections including Ebola virus. In fact, the lipid moiety of brincidofovir was found to be required for in vitro antiviral activity against Ebola virus.17\n",

The synthesis of the prodrugs was rather complicated by a low solubility of the starting PMEO-DAPy; finally we managed to synthesize two biodegradable ester prodrugs \u2013 pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) and (isopropoxycarbonyl)oxymethyl (POC) esters and the amino acid phosphoramidate prodrug (Scheme 1\n). Pivaloyloxymethylation was performed by reaction of the starting phosphonic acid with chloromethyl pivalate using N,N\u2032-dicyclohexyl-4-morpholinecarboxamidine as a base. The reaction proceeded very slowly to give a mixture of bis(POM) and mono(POM) esters 2 and 3. After chromatographic separation, both compounds were isolated in acceptable yields. Alternative reaction conditions (e.g. reaction in dioxane with DBU) completely failed. Also for the introduction of POC groups, different attempts have been examined (various solvents, DBU or diisopropylethylamine as bases). The only way that led to the bis(POC) derivative 4 consisted in transformation of free PMEO-DAPy to its tetrabutylammonium salt, followed by heating with POC-chloride in dioxane. The bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrug 5 was prepared by the direct coupling of PMEO-DAPy with ethyl l-alaninate in pyridine and treatment with a premixed solution of triphenylphosphine and 2,2\u2032-dipyridyl disulfide (Aldrithiol).",

The principle of this method is the utilization of the intermediary bis(trimethylsilyl) ester of ANP directly for reaction with 2,2\u2032dithiodipyridine, triphenylphosphine and amino acid ester to obtain bis-amidates without the need of laborious procedures to isolate the free phosphonic acids. The selection of amino acid esters is directed especially to diethyl esters of l-alanine or l-phenylalanine leading to prodrugs with optimal pharmacokinetic profile.20 In our case, we selected the diethyl ester of l-phenylalanine (Scheme 3\n). Similarly as with the preparation of POM and POC esters, we obtained not only the desired symmetrical bis-amidate prodrug 12 but also mono-amidate 13 accompanied by a small amount of mono-methyl ester 14. Compound 14 was formed most probably during the chromatographic separation of the mono-amidate prodrug in a system containing high percentage of methanol.",

The compounds use the LPC natural uptake pathway in the small intestine to reach the target tissue and achieve oral bioavailability. The most important compound of this family is the hexadecyloxypropyl ester of cidofovir (brincidofovir, CMX-001), currently in Phase III clinical trials for use in humans against HCMV and adenovirus infections. This compound is also being investigated as an experimental drug against smallpox and ebolavirus infections.22 In our previous studies, we have successfully applied the alkoxyalkylester approach to 9-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine ((S)-HPMPDAP)23 within the search for new bioavailable anti-poxvirus agents and for the synthesis of the above mentioned HDE-cHPMP-5-azaC (Fig. 2).14 In our synthesis, the starting PME-azaC was transformed first to its tetrabutylammonium salt, which was subsequently treated with hexadecyloxypropyl bromide to give the mixture of diester and monoester (15, 17). The monoester 17 is predominant most probably for steric reasons. Besides, small amounts of N\n4-alkylated product 16 were isolated (Scheme 4\n).",

            "text": "The last type of prodrugs included in this study are amino acid ester prodrugs where esterification of the phosphonic acid residue is performed via the free hydroxyl group of the appropriate hydroxy amino acid (serine, valine, tyrosine). This concept has been originally developed by McKenna\u2019s group to improve the oral bioavailability of (S)-HPMPC and (S)-HPMPA.24, 25 Pharmacokinetic studies of various amino acid or dipeptide prodrugs of these ANPs finally revealed that the tyrosine single amino acid was the most favorable promoiety regarding prodrug plasma stability. It was also found that enzymatic stability of the tyrosine promoiety can be significantly increased by replacement of the carboxyl ester with an alkyl amide group. The highest increase in bioavailability and antiviral activity was observed when a long lipophilic alkyl chain was incorporated into the tyrosine amide group. A comprehensive review including synthesis, SAR studies and pharmacology of tyrosine N-alkyl amide ANP prodrugs has been published recently.26 Considering these findings, we decided to synthesize the symmetrical bis-tyrosine prodrug 23 whose carboxylic function is modified by the hexadecylamido group (Scheme 5\n). The compound can be prepared via alkylation of the 5-azacytosine sodium salt with the whole aliphatic moiety, i.e. BOC protected bis(hexadecylamido-l-tyrosyl) ester of 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl chloride (21) prepared previously and followed by acidic removal of the protecting BOC groups. The tyrosine synthon 21 can be obtained by multistep synthesis from diisopropyl 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl chloride (18) which is known as a common building block in the synthesis of diverse PME derivatives.27 Isopropyl groups in 18 were removed first by the action of bromotrimethylsilane followed by hydrolysis. The intermediary phosphonic acid 19 was then activated by reaction with oxalyl chloride in DMF forming a phosphorodichloridate28 whose further reaction with BOC-protected hexadecyl tyrosine amide 20 in a presence of triethylamine formed diester 21 in good preparative yield. Tyrosine amide precursor 20 was prepared from N-BOC-l-tyrosine by standard coupling procedure using EDC and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in CH2Cl2 (similarly as described for other alkylated l-tyrosine amides, e.g. octyl or octadecyl).26, 29\n",

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) and further incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds.
