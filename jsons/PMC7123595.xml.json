Many academic centers are recognizing the importance of global health and are creating programs to train students to meet this growing demand. Global health centers and institutes also are being created to focus on the research and programmatic efforts needed to understand the burden of disease worldwide, as well as the financial, political, medical, policy, workforce, and infrastructure issues surrounding any solutions. Due to this emerging interest by the public health community, we need to understand where the intersection between global health and informatics occurs. For many years, the promise of what technology can do to alleviate suffering and support disease surveillance and other public health activities took precedence over understanding the environment in which the technology has to function. People and their participation in the implementation of the technological solution are critical for success. In resource-poor environments, the deployment of technological solutions faces other challenges for success. Lack of stable electrical power, availability of Internet connections, and a workforce that can support the information technology remain barriers to successful implementation. Yet, through experiences in the implementation of information technology as supported by international donors and the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, lessons are being learned to move forward towards the benefits that global health informatics can bring.",

As times and situations in the world have evolved, the terms to reflect these global changes have become more refined. However, to date, no single definition of global health has been widely adopted. As often occurs in a relatively new field, there appears to be ambiguity and elusiveness about what the field is. Most of the literature about global health suggests that global health includes health-related issues that cross national boundaries, are common to all people, and for which solutions can be translated to many different communities.",

Often, the terms international health and global health have been considered to be synonyms, and many considered it unnecessary to differentiate between them [9]. Conversely, others believe that differentiating the two terms helps global health practitioners develop clearer policy and direction. Brown et al.\u2019s view is that the term international was meaningful in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century when the focus was \u201ccontrol of epidemics across boundaries between nations,\u201d and the relationships regarding policies and practices of public health between the sovereign nations were central to solving health problems [10]. As the focus developed into a consideration of health needs of people worldwide \u201cabove that of particular nations\u201d, with increasing involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the term global health better described the worldview. As part of an initiative from the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) Executive Board, an examination was made to highlight the fundamental similarities and differences between global, international, and public health [11]. They determined that attributes of geography, cooperation, populations, access, and disciplines offer the best insights. In global health, the health issues transcend national boundaries, solutions require worldwide cooperation and involve both prevention and clinical care, health equity is a necessary pursuit among all nations, and collaborations are developed within and among multiple disciplines (Table 31.1).\n",

Public health measures, new medical technologies that have been readily adopted, and improved health literacy have all played a role in this increase. Collective global health actions also have been central to increasing the standard of health for all people. The foundation for these changes can be traced back to two critical policy statements: the 1978 WHO Declaration of Alma-Ata, which called for urgent action by governments and the world community to promote health of all the people of the world, and the 2000 United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration, which built upon the ideas of the Alma-Ata Declaration more specifically by outlining eight goals, each with measureable objectives to be achieved by 2015 [13]. Of these eight goals, now known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), three are directly related to health \u2013 Goal 4: Reduce child mortality rate; Goal 5: Improve maternal health; and Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.",

The authorization was for 5 years and up to US$15 billion for HIV care, treatment, and prevention, and included support for capacity building and strategic information (i.e., surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation) in 15 focus countries, and for initiatives by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and UNAIDS. This initiative is considered to be the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in history [16]. The 15 focus countries were among the countries hardest hit by HIV disease: Botswana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Viet Nam, and Zambia. In 2008, US Public Law 110\u2013293, Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, re-authorized PEPFAR for an additional 5 years and up to US$48 billion to expand to 49 countries and regional programs. Building on the established prevention, care and treatment, capacity building, and strategic information programs, PEPFAR II emphasizes country partnership and ownership, and strengthening of health systems. PEPFAR remains the largest funder of global health initiatives and has many successes in reducing the burden of HIV/AIDS in the focus countries. In fiscal year 2011, PEPFAR directly supported HIV testing and counseling for more than 9.8 million pregnant women, and care and treatment for nearly 13 million people including more than 4.1 million orphans and vulnerable children [17].",

High-quality data are essential to HIV prevention, care and treatment, policy development, resource planning, and accountability. Understanding the burden of disease requires functioning surveillance and aggregate indicator monitoring systems. Providing effective patient treatment requires consistent and available patient, laboratory and pharmacy data. All of the PEPFAR focus countries had major deficiencies in their national health information systems. During the first years of PEPFAR, the aim was to assist countries in developing health information system infrastructure that would support the national and PEPFAR HIV/AIDS programs. Health management information systems (HMIS) were developed to help report the 41 core indicators that were required as a condition of funding. These indicators and other nationally-oriented indicators were also used for policy development, program planning, implementation, and identification of best practices. These systems frequently were paper-based at the facility and district-levels of a country, and then captured into an electronic system at or before arriving at the Ministry of Health. In the countries with electronic data systems in facilities or districts, the effort was placed on harmonizing data elements and core data sets. As health information infrastructure matured in countries, patient-level data collection systems were implemented to be used for both patient care and for routine health information for surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, and resource planning.",

Prior to 2000, the collection of morbidity and mortality data relied on the completion of pre-printed forms by clinicians, nurses, and clerks. Outpatient diagnoses were recorded on a monthly tally sheet, and inpatient data was abstracted from a three-part discharge form. A team of data entry clerks entered data from the paper forms into computers using custom-developed data entry software written in dBase IV. Following a national review in 2001, a series of paper-registers were introduced, replacing tally sheets and discharge forms as the primary form of data collection. This shift to using registers for data collection required that health facilities manually aggregate their own data before reporting it. Particularly at district and central hospitals, the registers were increasingly being completed by lay clerks with little or no training in health or medical terminology, rather than by clinicians and nurses. To produce district-level and national-level reports from the manually-aggregated totals derived from paper registers, the District Health Information System (DHIS) software was adopted [20].",

We started our investigations at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), a 700+ bed referral hospital located in Malawi\u2019s capital city of Lilongwe. We observed that ward clerks had no training in medical terminology, but were required to both transcribe medical data as well as map diagnoses into indicators (e.g., Diabetes was mapped into an indicator called Other Non-communicable Diseases of Public Health Importance), raising questions about the completeness and accuracy of the reported data. Clinicians were over-burdened with patient care, and perceived documentation for \u201cstatistical\u201d purposes as outside the scope of clinical work and therefore not part of their responsibilities. We hypothesized that an electronic information system designed to support the delivery of healthcare in a resource-poor setting may provide clinicians and nurses with tools that would augment their ability to efficiently and effectively deliver healthcare, while collecting data as a transparent byproduct of system use. We proposed the idea of a rudimentary electronic medical record (EMR) that would be used by clinicians in real-time at the point-of-care, and moved ahead with the development of a system to be piloted in the pediatric department at KCH.",

Recognizing that to develop computer literacy among the users would take time, we opted for an entirely touchscreen-driven user interface. Secondly, power outages at the hospital were frequent, and would be a significant threat to building a reliable system. To address this, we developed a power back-up solution around locally-available deep-cycle batteries used for solar power installations. However, rather than charging them from solar panels, we simply connected them to a charger powered by the national grid. This solution, combined with the efficient low-power touchscreen computers, allowed the system to run for 36\u201348 hrs. in the absence of power from the grid [23].",

This system was deployed at three VCT sites in Malawi, where it was used by dozens of counselors with no prior computer training. This apparent success increased our confidence that electronic systems, if appropriately designed, could be used in real-time in low-resource settings. In 2004, working with the Lighthouse Clinic, an HIV Center of Excellence in Malawi, our focus on HIV moved into the development of a prototype EMR for managing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). This was our first encounter with designing a system to accommodate multiple points of care (patient check-in, vital signs station, nurses exam room, clinicians exam room, and pharmacy), and multiple workflows. This was a large undertaking, and pushed the limits of both our capacity and our capabilities.

Overwhelmed with the challenges of generating quarterly and cumulative cohort reports for programmatic M&E, the Department of HIV and AIDS within the Ministry of Health issued a request for proposals for the development of an electronic system to automate the generation of reports at high-burden sites. Working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and through a cooperative agreement with the CDC, we created a prototype point-of-care EMR system informed by our previous experiences to manage patients receiving ART that was developed around newly-introduced clinical practice guidelines, and the newly introduced cohort reporting M&E framework, and using the Ruby on Rails open-source software stack with parts of the OpenMRS system, particularly the data model [27, 28]. The EMR was piloted at two district hospitals in 2007. Refining the system, and particularly creation of the detailed cohort reports, took much longer than anticipated and was complicated by changes in national guidelines and the introduction of new drug regimens. However, following a lengthy pilot period, the system was adopted by the Ministry of Health in 2010 for national scale-up to high burden sites pending the availability of funds. By the end of 2012, the national ART EMR was deployed at 21 high-burden ART clinics (including the Lighthouse Clinic) collectively managing care and treatment for roughly 98,000 patients [23].",

Using estimated costs for installing and maintaining a hospital-wide EMR system at KCH, and projected savings over a 5-year period, we constructed a financial model to determine the potential return on investment. Based on this model, we were able to demonstrate a complete recapture of the initial investment costs of a hospital-wide system in less than 3 years [30].

Once we recognized the poorness of fit, we discontinued the use of this module. The pediatric admission module was significantly more successful, running for more than 18 months before being discontinued. Despite the apparent goodness of fit, and the positive feedback from users, it was difficult to keep the system running. Unlike other systems we had developed, the pediatric admission module relied on the use of laser printers. At the time we had no technical solution to powering laser printers from a backup source of power (now solved). Consequently, during periods of power failure clinicians would have to complete the admission note by hand. Other problems arose when printers ran out of paper, and there was no paper available to refill the tray. These problems frustrated clinicians. The system was finally discontinued when both laser printers were damaged by a power surge and there was no funding to replace them. KCH pharmacy staff reported the ePICS system deployed in 2005 was greatly beneficial to the smooth running of the pharmacy. However, without a directive from hospital management, the pharmacy staff was unable to discontinue using the paper-based stock system, and doing both was far too time-consuming. Struggling with the burden of maintaining parallel systems in the absence of a strong champion, staff use of ePICS became inconsistent several months after the ePICS system went live. This resulted in inaccurate stock levels in the system, and a general agreement to terminate the pilot. Both the pediatric admission module and the ePICS module were essentially demonstration projects that had no clear strategy to sustain them.",

As we move ahead, we must go back to basics, leveraging the lessons we have learned and refocusing on the mechanisms through which EMR use at the point-of-care can both improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare delivery costs. This will require a strategic approach at the country level, with involvement and cooperation of the Ministry of Health, technical partners, and funding agencies.

A key requirement in the management of HIV is access to CD4 counts that indicate the status of the patient\u2019s immune system. At IMB, it was found that many CD4 counts in patients\u2019 charts were out of date. Amoroso and colleagues studied the impact of adding a module to OpenMRS to allow direct entry of CD4 counts in the laboratory [36]. The findings showed that the number of CD4 counts that were out of date fell from 25.7 to 16.7 % (p < 0.002). Were et al. [37] in Kenya studied the impact of giving clinicians access to printed clinical summaries from OpenMRS that contained warnings of low CD4 counts. Their results showed that ordering of repeat CD4 counts increased from 38 to 63 % (p < 0.0001). More extensive evaluation is planned of the clinical impact of the system.",

The first stage of implementation of this project is underway in the Rwamagana district in the south east of the country, to support maternal health care. Data are being collected by clinic and hospital-based staff using OpenMRS, as well as community healthcare workers using mobile phones and text messaging with RapidSMS software. An instance of OpenMRS is installed on a server in the national data center and functions as a shared health record, combining data from local OpenMRS installations as well as from RapidSMS. Three national registries provide shared resources for patients, providers, and facilities, and there is a terminology server. The goal is to roll this system out nationally and extend it to cover other disease areas including HIV, TB, and primary care. OpenMRS installations managed by MOH and IMB will be included over time. An additional project is using a data standard called SDMX-HD to send reports from OpenMRS to a web-based national reporting system called TRACnet.",

Other key initiatives have been direct clinician viewing of patient summaries and implementation of patient registration with barcoded IDs (building on the experience from Malawi). The MOH team has pioneered work on a broader national rollout of OpenMRS and initial use in hospitals. There is now a large and growing international community developing and implementing OpenMRS. More than 50 developing countries are currently using OpenMRS clinically; many are carrying out development of new modules or contributing to improving the core system. Key initiatives include the development of standard concept dictionaries shared between implementations and countries, and tools to standardize core dictionaries for maternal health care. Many projects are linking OpenMRS to a range of mobile phone-based software tools including ODK, CommCare, Sana, and OpenXdata. The Kenyan MOH is currently rolling out OpenMRS to 300 rural clinics, building on the experience in Rwanda with help from programmers at PIH. Going forward, top priorities for the OpenMRS project are to simplify the setup of OpenMRS in new projects and provide reusable tools for managing diseases like HIV, primary care, and maternal health, as has been done for MDR-TB. The core goal will continue to be the use of data from OpenMRS for clinical care, program management, forecasting of supplies, and clinical research.",
