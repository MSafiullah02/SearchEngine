However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases. Methods: We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed. Results: Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3% developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2% had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9%) and cough (21.9%). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1% were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3%) and diabetes (5.5%), 10.9% were current smokers, 30.1% had low white blood cell counts and 45.2% showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4% severe cases and 2.7% critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 x \uf031\uf030 \uf039 \uf02fL cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes. Conclusion: The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7%, which is lower than the 26.1% reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Shiyan is located in the northwest of Hubei province and is a regional central city adjacent to Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, and Chongqing with approximately 3.5 million people.

Among all patients, only 10.9% were smokers, but in the severe/critical group, 6.7% were smokers, which is not significantly lower than that of the ordinary group with 14.0%. This result indicated that smoking is not a protective factor for COVID-19 patients, consistent with the TH Rainer studies [15] . Currently, there are no confirmed cases of medical staff infection in our hospital, indicating that as long as the medical staff are properly protected, the chance of infection can be effectively blocked [16] ; 5) The majority of the patients present with fever and cough, and most patients have intermittent fever and low fever, but a subset are characterized by fatigue, sore throat, and hoarseness, and accompanying symptoms include one case diarrhoea and one case of headache, similar to that reported by Wuhan [9] . One patient had no abnormal clinical manifestation, but this patient was previously in close contact with a person from another confirmed case, indicating that these unidentified symptom-less patients are a potentially horrible source of chain infection. 6) The proportion of severe/critical cases accounted for 41.1%, and the severe cases accounted for 38.4%. The critical cases that required admission to the ICU accounted for 2.7%, which is lower than the 26% currently reported in Wuhan [17] . The difference could be based on the different diagnostic criteria used because the new diagnostic standard, respiratory failure, shock, and other functional failures are viewed as critical criteria [3] , which will significantly increase the proportion of severe cases. The proportion of patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.8 attributed to critical illness showed no significance difference compared with that of the ordinary group, and thus we could not only rely on low lymphocyte count as a single factor to predict progression risk factors for critical illness [17] .",

The reasons are considered as follows: 1) The viral pathogenicity and toxicity are slightly higher in the first-generation patients, whereas the second-generation and third-generation patients consist mostly of mild and moderate cases, indicating that the transmission and viability of COVID-19 is notably strong under specific circumstances, which is consistent with the report by Qun Li [23] . The pathogenicity gradually weakens during the transmission process, and the reason for this observation needs to be further investigated; 2) Beginning in mid-January, greater attention was focused nationwide on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Patients in the surrounding areas of Wuhan cooperated with the government and took the initiative to go to the hospital for early diagnosis and treatment. 3) Shiyan has sufficient medical facilities and medical staff, with 5 first-class hospitals at grade 3A, and the medical resources per capita are high. Patients receiving timely and proper treatment is one of the reasons. 4)Patients were given nebulized acetylcysteine to inhale as an expectorant to protect their airways. At the same time, for patients with a strong inflammatory response and acute progression as observed on pulmonary imaging, the short-term use of low-dose glucocorticoid for anti-inflammation might be one of the reasons for achievement of good treatment outcomes.",

As such, comorbidity of diabetes and the absolute number of lymphocytes cannot be separately used as risk factors for severe/critical outcomes at the initial diagnosis.",

Obviously, the virus incubation period is long, the virulence is relatively low, and the onset is relatively secretive. At initial diagnosis, most of patients are classified as ordinary patients, whereas the number of patients who become severe and critical are lower than that reported in Wuhan. Diabetes might be one of the risk factors for progression to severe and critical manifestations. However, multivariate regression analysis should be explored to predict the factors for development into severe and critical conditions and to guide the allocation of clinical resources.",
