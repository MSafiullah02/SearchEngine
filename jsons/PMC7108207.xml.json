This change simplified the workflow at each site laboratory performing CHAMPS TAC testing such that specimens from each patient are tested on the same set of 4 TACs (respiratory, enteric, blood/CSF tier 1, and blood/CSF tier 2) regardless of patient age. Each card configuration was designed to allow testing of 6 specimens along with negative and positive controls in each run to ensure data quality and integrity.",

We empirically evaluated assay performance in singleplex and multiplex reaction formats to ensure sensitivity and specificity were not negatively impacted by multiplexing. We also considered the optimal number of replicates; in brief, assays were spotted in 2 replicates on respiratory and enteric configurations and 4 replicates in most cases for blood and CSF configurations due to improved sensitivity with higher replicates for testing of whole blood specimens observed during earlier work [13]. Another consideration for organization of assays on blood tier 1 and tier 2 configurations was ensuring assays related by multitarget interpretation algorithms were included on the same card to simplify data management. In addition, a few targets previously restricted to other card configurations (Acinetobacter baumannii, respiratory; Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, enteric) were added to the blood/CSF TAC configurations to examine the impact of postmortem dissemination of organisms from respiratory or enteric tract niches.",

Subject matter experts from various divisions within CDC or other institutes were consulted to determine the best genetic targets to optimize sensitivity and specificity of detection of the desired microorganism(s). Oligonucleotides were designed using Primer Express version 3.0.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts), PrimerQuest Tool (Integrated DNA Technologies [IDT], Coralville, Iowa; www.idtdna.com/primerquest), or manually via sequence alignment of gene or target region using Clustal Omega (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo). In some cases, whole genome multiple sequence alignments were performed using the progressiveMauve algorithm [14] to confirm presence of target regions in targeted organisms and absence in closely related species. Each set of oligonucleotides was evaluated to ensure optimal melting temperature for the thermocycling conditions as well as to identify potential self-dimerization or intermolecular dimerization between selected oligonucleotide combinations. All oligonucleotides were assessed in silico by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis against the GenBank nt database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to assess specificity and inclusivity of selected target regions for detection of the appropriate group of organisms (genus, species, subtype, etc). When necessary, degenerate bases were included to ensure primer/probe binding in slightly variable target sequence regions. Probes incorporating a Minor Groove Binder moiety were used in some assays to increase the melting temperature of the probe when only a short stretch of nucleotides was identified to have sufficient sequence identity across variants available within public databases [15]. Oligonucleotides were manufactured by IDT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, or the Biotechnology Core Facility at CDC.",

This testing was performed to ensure no false amplification due to oligomerization of oligonucleotides, nonspecific priming events, or lack of specificity for target sequence within targeted genus, species, or strain type. Analytical sensitivity (determination of lower limit of detection) was independently determined for each assay in both singleplex and, when applicable, multiplex format by testing at least 8 replicates each of a 10-fold dilution series of specific total nucleic acid ranging from 0.1 fg/\u00b5L to 1 ng/\u00b5L. Inclusivity was assessed by testing representative isolates, including various subspecies, serotypes, or clonal groups, as appropriate.

            "text": "Performance characteristics for select duplex and triplex reactions were confirmed using a small batch of TACs manufactured for proof-of-concept testing of multiplex reactions on TAC. In particular, these TACs were used to assess the impact of reduced reaction volume (25\u00d7 smaller on TAC compared to 96-well plate format used for assay development), lyophilization of oligonucleotides on microfluidic array, and performance and compatibility of differentially labeled oligonucleotide probes. Initially, triplex reactions were evaluated with probes differentially labeled at the 5\u2032 position with FAM, HEX, and Cy5, all with 3\u2032 modification with a Black Hole Quencher (BHQ) fluorescent quencher molecule. Despite successful performance in 96-well plate format, Cy5-labeled probes performed poorly on TACs; in some cases these assays were unable to be interpreted. We evaluated a newer reporter dye (ABY, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to replace Cy5. ABY-labeled probes were modified with a different quencher molecule (QSY) and exhibited superior performance compared to 5\u2032Cy5/3\u2032BHQ both in 96-well and TAC microfluidic card formats. However, ABY-labeled probes were incompatible with HEX-labeled probes in multiplex format due to emission spectral overlap of the 2 fluorophores and inadequate quenching of signal using BHQ compared to QSY. Assay performance was improved by replacing 5\u2032HEX/3\u2032BHQ probes with 5\u2032VIC/3\u2032QSY versions, eliminating spectral cross-talk for multiplex reaction formats on TAC. We also evaluated probe concentrations using the optimal probe quencher modifications, including QSY and ZEN double-quenched probes (IDT). The amplification signal was substantially improved with both 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032QSY and 5\u2032FAM/ZEN/3\u2032IBQ probes compared to 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032BHQ probes; the intensity of FAM fluorescence was approximately 10-fold higher for QSY-quenched compared to BHQ-quenched probes (data not shown). Use of these quenchers allowed for a lower final concentration of probe to be used in multiplex reactions when using 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032QSY or 5\u2032FAM/ZEN/3\u2032IBQ, saving on cost. In addition to the evaluation in 96-well plate format, a batch of TACs was manufactured with varying permutations of probe modifications (reporters, quenchers, and reaction concentrations) to compare performance or 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032QSY, 5\u2032FAM/ZEN/3\u2032IBQ, and 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032BHQ in both singleplex and multiplex reaction formats on the TAC microfluidic system. For most assays, 5\u2032HEX/3\u2032BHQ was replaced with 5\u2032VIC/3\u2032QSY unless the assay required an internal quencher, in which case 5\u2032HEX/ZEN/3\u2032IBQ was used. Overall, the use of QSY and/or ZEN/IBQ quenchers and FAM, VIC, and ABY reporter dyes was identified as the optimal combination for reducing/removing fluorescence cross-talk between detection channels on TAC.",

In some cases, nucleic acids from a large number of potential pathogens are detected, particularly in nonsterile site specimens. Attributing detected organisms to cause of death is extremely complex as detection of pathogen nucleic acid does not necessarily indicate a contribution to disease state or to death. Many potentially pathogenic organisms may be present in a long-term carriage state, especially in upper respiratory and gastrointestinal specimens, yet it is nearly impossible to distinguish this status using molecular detection methods alone. In addition, microorganisms may disseminate from the original site of infection during the time leading up to and following death. However, TAC results are a highly valuable adjunct to postmortem tissue pathology studies helping to suggest the need for special stains and immunohistochemistry testing (see Martines et al in this supplement). Further evaluation will be performed to investigate the extent of perimortem dissemination to pathogen detection and cause of death determination, including the impact of time from death to completion of the MITS procedure.
