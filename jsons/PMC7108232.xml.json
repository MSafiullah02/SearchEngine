HCoV-HKU1 was detected in 19 of 645 (2.95%) children. 47.37% of them were coinfected with other respiratory viruses with RSV the most common coinfection virus. The most common symptom and clinical diagnoses with HCoV-HKU1 infection were crackles and acute asthmatic bronchopneumonia. A single HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating locally in the years 2007 and 2008. Our study indicated that patients with underlying disease may be more prone to HCoV-HKU1 infection with no impact on clinical symptoms, hospitalization rate or hospital stay duration.",
