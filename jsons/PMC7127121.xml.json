The sequencing of complete genomes, such as the human genome, has set the stage to address proteome-wide interaction studies, which have revealed that proteins do not typically exist as isolated entities 2, 3, 4. Rather, they are assembled in complex molecular machines consisting of numerous proteins and, often, other biomolecules (such as nucleic acids, sugars, lipids and small molecules), arranged into functional modules that catalyze essential cellular processes. This molecular organization has been recently termed \u2018protein sociology\u2019 [5].",

            "text": "Notwithstanding, our molecular understanding of the very large number of protein complexes in the cell remains limited to a handful of examples for which detailed near-atomic structures are known. This is mostly because of the difficulty in obtaining samples in sufficient quality and quantity for molecular studies. Many essential complexes remain intractable because they exist in very low amounts in their endogenous host, which hinders their purification from native source material. Recombinant overproduction can resolve this bottleneck, and numerous expression systems, mostly for heterologous protein expression in Escherichia coli, have been developed and refined over the past few decades. More recently, E. coli expression systems have been designed for coexpression of several proteins by using polycistronic mRNA transcripts, or two or more plasmids that coexist in the same cell 10, 11 (Box 1\n). However, many eukaryotic protein complexes cannot be produced efficiently in E. coli. They may contain subunits that are too large for the E. coli transcription and translation machinery, or may require either specific chaperone systems for proper folding or protein modifications (such as phosphorylation or acetylation) that E. coli cannot provide. Thus, the successful overproduction of these complexes, which is required to decipher their structure and function, depends on the availability of powerful eukaryotic expression technologies. In this review, we describe MultiBac, a recent eukaryotic expression system that is specifically designed to tackle and overcome this crucial production bottleneck 12, 13. We summarize the technology concepts underlying MultiBac and review its wide range of applications.Box 1Coexpression toolbox for production of protein complexesExpression systems for production of protein complexes in E. coli frequently make use of polycistronic expression cassettes with several genes of interest, spaced apart by ribosome binding sites (Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequences), placed under the control of a single promoter, and typically followed by a sequence for efficient termination of mRNA transcription 10, 11, 21, 60, 61, 62 (Figure I\na). In eukaryotic hosts, an analogous design can involve internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs), which are inserted between gene coding regions under control of a single promoter 24, 25, 26, 27 (Figure Ib). IRESs exist in the 5\u2032-untranslated regions of many viral and cellular mRNAs [24], and facilitate cap-independent translation by recruiting ribosomes for efficient protein production. IRES sequences differ greatly and exhibit species specificity [26]. For example, IRES elements from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) work well in mammalian cells, whereas IRESs from Perina nuda virus (PhV) and Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV) have been successfully used for protein complex production in insect cells [27].Polyproteins are long polypeptides containing individual proteins spaced by specific proteolytic cleavage sites. Certain viruses, such as coronavirus, produce their entire proteome by proteolytic processing of polyproteins encoded by a few open reading frames. Polyprotein approaches have proven to be particularly powerful for balancing the stoichiometry of coexpressed proteins 22, 28, 29, 30 (Figure Ic). Polyprotein constructions can involve self-cleaving peptides found in picornavirus (called P2A peptides) or variants thereof 28, 29. Alternatively, constructions can be used that mimic open reading frames in positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and provide a highly specific protease gene together with genes of interest arranged in a single large open reading frame 22, 30. Individual proteins are then liberated from the encoded polyprotein by the protease, which cleaves the proteolytic sites placed between the protein subunits (Figure Ic).The elucidation of protein\u2013protein interactions in complexes is of crucial importance for many applications including structural biology. A novel approach, CoESPRIT, utilizes library-based construct screening for the identification and expression of soluble protein complexes in E. coli\n[31]. In CoESPRIT, a subunit of a (putative) protein complex is provided as bait. The interacting partner is provided in the form of a random incremental library generated by exonuclease digestion of the full-length gene. Prior input from bioinformatics analyses such as homology alignments or domain identification is not required for this approach. Coexpression of the library with the bait protein allows identification of soluble complexes by immunofluorescence-assisted colony screening using labeled antibody markers against affinity tags present on the proteins screened. Production of protein complex from high-expressor colonies thus identified can then be scaled up to milligram amounts for high-resolution studies by NMR or X-ray crystallography [31].",

The presence of many subunits in a protein complex requires the assembly of many encoding genes and their integration into the baculovirus in a multicomponent co-production experiment. This process is laborious and technically challenging using conventional methods that typically involve serial insertion of genes into increasingly large and difficult-to-handle DNA plasmids. MultiBac applies a different concept for multigene assembly that relies on recombination of small, custom-designed, synthetic DNA plasmid molecules (< 3 kb) that are called \u2018acceptors\u2019 and \u2018donors\u2019 (Figure 1a).",

The resulting multigene expression constructs are characterized by the precise combinations of resistance markers present on the fusions, and this can be exploited for combinatorial assembly strategies based on multiple antibiotic selection [21].

Multigene acceptor\u2013donor fusion constructs are transformed into these bacterial cells, and the Tn7 transposon enzyme inserts the collection of expression cassettes present on the acceptor\u2013donor fusion in a single-step reaction into the Tn7 attachment site engineered into the baculoviral genome (Figure 1b). Productive transposition disrupts a LacZ\u03b1-encoding gene, which enables blue/white screening of colonies. The MultiBac baculoviral genome has been engineered for improved protein complex production by removing genes encoding viral protease and apoptotic activities, thereby reducing proteolytic breakdown of the heterologous gene products and delaying lysis of the infected cells 12, 13. As a second site of entry in addition to the Tn7 attachment site, the MultiBac genome contains also a distal LoxP site for adding further functionalities. For example, a gene encoding \u03bb-phosphatase was inserted into this site to remove phosphates from a coexpressed protein complex [23]. The composite MultiBac virus is then purified and used to transfect insect cells for protein production in Petri dishes containing cell monolayers or, for larger volumes, shaker flasks containing suspension cultures 13, 19, 20. MultiBac resolves several challenges encountered in protein complex production. These include constraints on handling many and often very large encoding DNAs and the necessity to revise expression experiments rapidly and flexibly if a subunit or purification tag needs to be altered or exchanged, by replacing the respective donor or acceptor with a modified version in the tandem recombineering pipeline.",

Many proteins and their complexes have been produced by MultiBac, often for the first time, for structure elucidation, providing important insight into their biological function (Figure 2). In some cases, for example for producing intact full-length protein kinase C\u03b2II, an existing transfer plasmid was combined with the optimized MultiBac baculovirus genome for protein production [32]. The modular concept of gene assembly by tandem recombineering has turned out to be instrumental for accelerating the process of obtaining high-quality samples for structural biology of numerous complexes 33, 34, 35, 36.Box 2Crystal structure of the Mediator head moduleMediator is a large multiprotein complex that is central to gene expression in eukaryotes and is organized into three modules termed head, middle or arm, and tail [63]. The size and complexity of Mediator has long posed a major challenge for structural studies. Mediator head (seven subunits, 223 kDa) was first successfully produced recombinantly by infecting insect cells with single baculoviruses, each encoding one subunit, opening the door for structural studies [36]. However, this procedure required lengthy optimization to indentify suitable, highly producing recombinant baculoviruses by repeated rounds of laborious screening \u2013 a process of 8 weeks or longer for each baculovirus. The demanding procedures constrained logistics and severely compromised attempts at structure determination of Mediator head by X-ray crystallography, which typically necessitates flexible, stream-lined and efficient production protocols for generating many variants of the protein specimen studied. The MultiBac system elegantly resolved this fundamental impediment [35]. All genes encoding the subunits of the Mediator head module were inserted into a single MultiBac baculovirus by using tandem recombineering 36, 64. Combinatorial assembly of the genes lead to a series of MultiBac baculoviruses encoding either full Mediator head (Med17, Med6, Med18, Med8, Med20, Med11 and Med22) or subcomplexes including core head (Med17, Med6, Med8, Med11 and Med22) and mini head (Med17, Med11 and Med22). Investigation of these complexes by EM allowed initial assignment of subunit positions [64]. Modification of Med17 and Med18 by eliminating flexible regions was crucial to obtain diffraction-quality head module crystals, and this was easily accomplished by simply exchanging the respective unmodified genes in the original MultiBac baculovirus expressing the full head [35]. The modular acceptor\u2013donor construction principle of MultiBac is crucial to facilitate this alteration, alleviating a need to assemble the entire multigene construct every time again de novo. The recombinant head module has been purified and crystallized, and the architecture of this 223-kDa complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography (Figure I\n). The crystal structure of the Mediator head reveals how this essential complex is built from its components to provide stability as well as flexibility for transcription regulation, resulting in a platform for other transcription factors [35]. Notably, a portion of the head named \u2018neck domain\u2019 confers stability and integrity of the complex by forming a striking, novel multihelical bundle, engaging five of the seven subunits of Mediator head.",

            "text": "Clearly, MultiBac is only one of many tools that bring such studies to fruition. Nonetheless, quality sample preparation is a crucial component of the structural determination pipeline. The studies already available exemplify the aptitude of the system, and hint at recurring challenges encountered when using MultiBac in multiprotein complex research (Box 3\n). The list of illuminating structures of complexes produced by using MultiBac can be expected to grow rapidly in the future.Box 3MultiBac debugged: challenges and solutionsA multitude of factors can compromise the production of multiprotein complexes. Among the major impediments are:\nInsufficient knowledge of the composition of the complex. Recombinant production of such a complex by coexpression will invariably fail if a subunit crucial for complex integrity has not been properly identified in original preparations. Although proteomics and genomics technologies increasingly contribute to improve and validate the data available (reviewed in [1]), protein complex coexpression can already reveal important information about interacting partners even if the (presumed) complete complex cannot be obtained.\nPost-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs such as phosphorylation and acetylation can be essential for proper assembly of a complex or for its activity. Thus, the modification activity needs to be either coexpressed or supplied during purification. An additional problem is that insect cells may decorate proteins with nonphysiological PTMs (frequently phosphorylation), which compromise complex formation or activity. Therefore, mutations that abolish the modification activity must be introduced in the host genome, or enzymes (such as \u03bb-phosphatase) that remove the modification have to be coexpressed or supplied [23]. Alternatively, inhibitors of the particular modifying enzyme (if known) can be added to the growth media if compatible with cell growth and protein production.\nComplex instability. Coexpression of an entire complex from a single virus may not be the ultimate solution. For example, a complex may dissociate during purification in a salt gradient. It may be worth identifying exactly what components dissociate during purification; stable subcomplexes may then be produced separately to reconstitute the complex in vitro by choosing proper conditions.\nEffort required to place all subunit genes on a single baculovirus. For very large complexes, this may be challenging, and applying co-infection with a small number (two or three) of multigene viruses instead may be a viable option.\nVirus instability. This is a drawback of every baculovirus expression system, because baculoviruses deteriorate during amplification and passaging. Gene deletions, notably affecting heterologous DNA inserts, can potentially abolish complex production. To minimize such deleterious events, specific protocols have been delineated 13, 20, and new approaches to overcome viral in stability by genome engineering are being developed [65].",

Coatomer consists of seven subunits and exists in four isoforms of different subunit composition. The four isoforms co-purify when extracted from animal tissue, which hampers their structural analysis and impedes attempts to understand the potentially different functions of the individual isoforms.

Originally, tandem recombineering was developed for generating multiexpression plasmids for production of protein complexes in E. coli to alleviate imbalances in expression levels observed with multiplasmid co-transformation [21]. Expression of protein complexes in mammalian cells can be achieved by transfection with multiple plasmids, in analogy to multiplasmid co-transformation in E. coli. However, this approach can lead to imbalanced production from the plasmids and to heterogeneous cell populations with differences in the ratio of plasmids incorporated. This impediment can be efficiently resolved by using a single plasmid that contains all the heterologous genes. This multigene plasmid can be conveniently generated by tandem recombineering of properly modified acceptors and donors, in which the baculoviral promoters are exchanged for mammalian promoters 22, 42. The resulting multigene plasmid is introduced into mammalian cells by using a transfection reagent [42].",

Further advantages are the ease of producing baculoviruses and the large tolerance for heterologous gene insertions into the viral genome without compromising virion integrity.

(a) MultiBac consists of an array of small (3 kb), synthetic DNA plasmids called acceptors and donors. Acceptors have a regular origin of replication (oriColE1), whereas donors have a conditional origin derived from R6K\u03b3 phage (oriR6k\u03b3) that requires special bacterial strains for their propagation. Donors and acceptors contain expression cassettes controlled by late baculoviral promoters (polh or p10) as well as strong eukaryotic polyadenylation signals (from SV40 or HSVtk). All plasmids contain the LoxP sequence (circles filled in red) for fusing donors to an acceptor by the Cre recombinase. Each plasmid has a different resistant marker: gentamycin resistance (GnR) for acceptors, and either chloramphenicol (CmR), kanamycin (KnR) or spectinomycin (SpR) resistance for donors. In addition, a \u2018multiplication\u2019 module is present to facilitate the assembly of several expression cassettes on a donor or acceptor based on specifically designed restriction sites (e.g. homing endonucleases and BstXI restriction endonuclease, shown as blue boxes flanking promoter and terminator, respectively) 18, 19, 21. Acceptors contain the DNA sequences (Tn7L and Tn7R) required for transposition by the Tn7 transposase. (b) The assembly of a composite MultiBac baculoviral genome for multigene expression. Genes are inserted into donors and acceptors by using either restriction endonucleases and ligase, or sequence-independent and ligation-independent cloning methods (bottom). Cre-mediated fusion produces a multigene construction that is inserted into the baculoviral genome by Tn7 transposition in specifically tailored E. coli cells that contain the viral DNA (also known as a bacmid). The DNA located between the Tn7R and Tn7L sequences in the multigene fusion construct is inserted by the transposase enzyme into the Tn7 attachment site (mini-attTn7). The MultiBac baculovirus was engineered for improved protein production and delayed host cell lysis by deleting specific genes [12]. The combination of sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) for gene insertion and Cre\u2013LoxP fusion for multigene construct generation is called tandem recombineering and can be performed in a parallelized mode on microtiter plates, optionally on a robot [21]. Further heterologous genes can be inserted into an additional LoxP site present on the bacmid. Composite baculoviral DNA is then purified from the bacteria and used to transfect insect cells. Virus is expanded by infecting small-volume (50\u2013100 ml) insect cell cultures and harvesting the budded virus particles released into the culture media. This virus is then used for protein complex expression in larger (typically one to several liters) insect cell cultures 13, 20.",

Leptin is a hormone that acts in the brain to reduce food intake and stimulate energy expenditure. Bac-VP produces the AAV virion coat proteins. Complete rAAV virions containing the leptin gene are produced in triply co-infected insect cells and purified 50, 52, and then administered to diet-induced obese rats. An obese rat is shown compared to a normal rat for illustration (bottom). Diet-induced obesity renders laboratory rats (and presumably other species) resistant to leptin treatment. Therefore, it is close to impossible to curtail diet-induced weight gain. This could be overcome by circumventing leptin resistance or restoring leptin actions in obese animals. The surprising outcome of the study involving baculovirus-produced leptin rAAV as a gene therapy vector was that exercise, in this study wheel-running, was required to prevent completely weight gain when combined with the leptin gene therapy intervention, leading to the conclusion that work-out, in tandem with leptin gene delivery, may actually develop into a potential antiobesity treatment [52].

            "text": "Figure I: Tools for expression of protein complexes. (a) Protein complexes can be produced efficiently in E. coli by using polycistrons. In polycistrons, genes of interest are spaced apart by ribosome binding sites (rbs) and placed under control of a single promoter (Prom). A sequence (Term) ensures termination of mRNA transcription. One or several polycistrons can be provided on one or more plasmids simultaneously in one cell. (b) The equivalent construction for eukaryotic expression provides IRESs instead of rbs, resulting also in polycistronic mRNAs. (c) Polyproteins are particularly useful to balance the stoichiometry of expressed proteins. Polyprotein constructions can provide self-cleaving peptides derived from picornavirus (2A) in between the individual proteins (top). A fluorescent protein (here CFP) can be included to facilitate tracking of heterologous expression from the respective promoter by fluorescence measurement. As an alternative, polyproteins can be used that contain a highly specific protease [here tobacco etch virus (TEV) Nla], which processes the polyprotein by cleaving corresponding cleavage sites (tcs), thus liberating the individual proteins including itself (bottom). Both polyprotein strategies have the drawback of decorating the C terminus of the preceding protein with overhanging residues that are part of the cleavage sequence (boxed). Asterisks denote sites of cleavage. Conserved residues defining the site are in bold. C-terminal overhangs are underlined.",
