In addition, preeclampsia occurs in approximately 5% of pregnant women, and is the major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide with an estimated 50,000 eclamptic deaths per year [1]. Despite the magnitude of these health related problems, and substantial advances in understanding their pathophysiology, insight concerning the biochemical mechanisms underlying essential hypertension and preeclampsia\u2013eclampsia remains incomplete. This review focuses on the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to hypertension and preeclampsia, and especially the role of aminopeptidase A (APA) in the maintenance of normal blood pressure and the development of hypertension. A key component of this process is the availability of sufficient levels of APA to facilitate conversion of the octapeptide angiotensin II (AngII), to the heptapeptide angiotensin III (AngIII). Much is known concerning the role of APA under both normotensive and hypertensive states, however gaps in our knowledge exist and will be noted.",

These processes are primarily mediated by the AT1 receptor subtype (AT1R; reviewed in [2\u20137]). A second subtype, the AT2 receptor (AT2R) is also involved in the mediation of blood pressure, renal function, and vascular growth [3, 8, 9]. AngII has been considered the end product of the peripheral RAS and acts as an agonist at these two receptor subtypes. Angiotensinogen serves as a precursor protein to all angiotensin peptides (Fig. 1). The decapeptide, angiotensin I (AngI), is formed by the protease renin (EC3.4.23.15) acting upon the N-terminal of angiotensinogen. In turn AngI is a substrate for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE: EC3.4.15.1), a zinc metalloprotease that hydrolizes the carboxyl terminal dipeptide histadine-leucine (His-Leu) to form AngII [10]. AngII is converted to AngIII by APA that cleaves the aspartic acid (Asp) residue at the N-terminal [11\u201314]. Membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N (APN: EC3.4.11.2) cleaves arginine (Arg) at the N-terminal of AngIII to form the hexapeptide, angiotensin IV (AngIV) [15].\n\n",

Thus, the angiotensin ligand binds to the AT1R and induces a conformational change in the receptor protein, thus activating G-proteins that mediate signal transduction. This transduction includes several plasma membrane mechanisms including phospholipase-C, phospholipase-A2, and phospholipase-D-adenylate cyclase, plus L-type and T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels [3, 16]. The AT1R (now designated AT1A) is also coupled to intracellular signaling cascades that regulate gene transcription and expression of proteins that mediate cellular proliferation and growth in many target tissues. The AT1B subtype is approximately 92\u201395% homologous with the amino acid sequence of the AT1A subtype [9, 17]. Out of these two isoforms the AT1A subtype appears to be responsible for the classic functions associated with the RAS (reviewed in [6, 18]). The AT2R subtype also evidences a 7-transmembrane domain characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors but shows only about 32\u201334% amino acid sequence identity with the AT1A receptor. The AT2R subtype appears to be maximally sensitive to AngIII, but AngII also serves as a ligand at this subtype.\n\n",

Each of these CVOs directly or indirectly projects to the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus to induce vasopressin release that acts as a potent vasoconstrictor (reviewed in [19, 20]). It has also been shown that microinjections of AngII into the SFO, OVLT, and PVN elicit elevations in blood pressure (reviewed in [20]).

Thus, circulating levels of AngII impact the baroreceptor reflex by a pathway from the AP to the NTS [22, 23].

The APA inhibitor 3-amino-4-thio-butyl-sulfonat (EC33) has been shown to increase the half-life of AngII by 2.6-fold as measured in hypothalamic homogenates, and completely blocks the formation of AngIII. An APN inhibitor 2-amino-pentane-1,5-dithiol (EC27) increased the half-life of AngIII by 2.3-fold. When AngII was icv injected in mice plasma vasopressin levels were increased 2-fold. The co-application of EC33 with AngII inhibited this AngII-induced vasopressin response in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, icv injection of EC27 increased plasma vasopressin levels in a dose-dependent fashion. This increase in vasopressin release following the application of EC27 could be blocked by the accompanying injection of the nonspecific angiotensin receptor antagonist saralasin (Sar1, Ale8-AngII). These results suggest that central angiotensin-induced vasopressin release is dependent upon the conversion of AngII to AngIII, and therefore AngIII may be the main effective peptide in the brain with respect to the mediation of vasopressin release. Consistent with these findings, Song and colleagues [29] developed an antiserum with anticatalytic activity against APA.

Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with EC33 blocked the pressor activity induced by the subsequent infusion of [D-Asp1]AngII; while EC33 had no effect on the pressor response induced by the subsequent infusion of [D-Arg1]AngIII. In contrast, pretreatment infusion with PC18 extended the duration of the [D-Asp1]AngII pressor effect by approximately 2\u20133 times and the duration of the [D-Arg1]AngIII effect by approximately 10\u201315 times. Pretreatment with the specific AT1R antagonist losartan blocked the pressor responses induced by the infusion of both analogs indicating they act via the AT1R subtype. These results suggest that the brain AT1R might be designed to preferentially bind AngIII, or an AngIII-like compound, in mediating blood pressure maintenance. Recent attempts to enhance the bioavailability and potency of EC33 have focused on the synthesis of non-peptidic inhibitors that interact at the S1 and S\u20321 subsites of aminopeptidase A [31].",

Autoregulatory mechanisms normally protect the microvasculature from temporary elevations in systemic blood pressure. However, if these mechanisms are compromised as in diabetes, arterial hypertension produces glomerulopathy. Early on this failure results in afferent arteriolar vasodilation accompanied by pressure-induced vasoconstriction [34]. With progression of renal disease hypertension predisposes proteinuria and progressive renal failure [35]. AngII plays an important role in this etiology by inducing both systemic and glomerular hypertension [34], and producing intrarenal vasoconstriction. Thus, decreased renal blood flow leads to ischemic-induced injuries, resulting in further renin release and the promotion of proteinuria that ultimately contributes to tubular injury [36].",

In agreement with essential hypertension the SHR evidences normal or decreased plasma renin activity and initially was considered to possess a renin-independent etiology. However, treatment with an ACE inhibitor, or an AT1R blocker (ARB), normalized blood pressure suggesting a role for the RAS in this model [38, 39]. Administration of APA plus APN (purified from human placenta) lowered AngII-induced blood pressure in rats [40]; while purified APA decreased SHR blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion ([41]; Fig. 2). Thus, an increase in APA activity may play a protective role in hypertension; whereas impairment of APA activity may contribute to the development of hypertension in the SHR by permitting increased levels of circulating AngII. Given that the kidney influences systemic blood pressure via its release of renin, and APA is highly expressed within the kidney [42], it appeared appropriate to measure APA activity in the renal cortex of SHRs as compared with that of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY; [43]). Renal APA activity in the SHR (12 weeks of age) was significantly lower than measured in WKY rats, supporting the notion that a reduced concentration of renal APA may facilitate the development of hypertension in this model. Along these lines, AngII intravascularly infused via osmotic pump during days 15\u201320 of gestation provoked significantly greater blood pressure increases in nonpregnant than pregnant SHR and WKY rats [43]. Renal APA activity was greater in pregnant than nonpregnant SHRs. In addition, renal APA activity was significantly lower in SHRs at 12 weeks than measured in WKYs. In contrast, Healy and Song [38] have reported major increases in renal APA activity in SHRs as compared with WKY rats at 4, 8, and 16 weeks of age.\n\n",

Song and Healy [38] have reported that although the level of APA in glomeruli was increased, there was APA decreases in kidney cortical membranes in both clipped and non-clipped kidneys at 4 weeks. Prieto and colleagues [46] have shown that clipped and non-clipped kidneys evidence reductions in APA expression in cortical homogenates. They speculated that this reduction might contribute to the maintenance of hypertension in this model by facilitating the tubular effects of AngII on sodium and water reabsorption. These investigators [47] also examined the influence of two kidney-one clip hypertension on the metabolism of AngIII to AngIV by aminopeptidase M (AlaAP) and AngI to Angiotensin(2\u201310) by aspartyl aminopeptidase (AspAP) in the renal cortex and medulla of rats. Cortical AlaAP levels were elevated in the nonclipped kidneys of the hypertensive rats, as compared with the clipped kidneys and normotensive rats, suggesting increased formation of AngIV.

Given these results it may be that APA-deficient mice have reduced AT2R expression that results in blood pressure elevations without cardiac hypertrophy. In this way AngII stimulation of the AT1R in APA-deficient mice could elevate blood pressure, but not cause renal and cardiac abnormalities via upregulation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2. Kagami et al. [57] have reported AngII-induced mesangial cell synthesis of matrix proteins and these effects were mediated by AngII induction of TGF-\u03b2 expression.

Although the cleavage of C-terminal phenylalanine from AngII by ACE2 to generate the vasodilator Angiotensin1\u20137, can influence both blood pressure and AngII concentrations, endogenous ACE2 activity is incapable of reversing the hypertensive effect of APA-deficiency. Compensatory increases in the activity of other APA-like aminopeptidases is unlikely given that APA-deficient mice evidence negligible APA-like activity [53].

            "text": "An understanding of the mechanisms underlying salt-induced hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat (DSS) is of considerable interest given the important role of sodium in hypertensive disorders [58]. Our laboratory has measured changes in renal APA activity and histological changes in the glomerulus of both DSS and Dahl salt-resistant (DSR) rats [59]. When low-(0.3%) or high-(8%) salt diets were administered to DSR and DSS rats, only high-salt DSS rats revealed systolic blood pressure increases that reached approximately 150 mm Hg by week 10, peaking at just under 250 mm Hg by week 18. Several mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this response by DSS rats including sympathetic arousal, deficiency in nitric oxide, increased plasma endothelin-1, an overactive RAS [59]. Although there is no evidence that the peripheral RAS is activated, the local renal RAS is stimulated in DSS rats suggesting a significant contribution by the RAS to the hypertension seen in this model [58]. Renal APA activity is elevated 3-fold at week 10 in high-salt DSR rats, similar to that seen in high-salt DSS rats. Thereafter it remained at this level (Fig. 5). This increase in renal APA may serve to metabolize AngII, thus protecting the high-salt DSR rat from hypertension in response to high salt intake. On the other hand, APA activity in low-salt DSR rats was unchanged. DSR rats on high-salt intake revealed lowered renal AngII levels at week 10 (305 \u00b1 15 fmol/g protein versus 212 \u00b1 16 fmol/mg protein) and they remained at this level accompanied by an increase in APA activity. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the decreases in AngII levels measured in DSR rats were due to increased degradation of AngII by APA, thus preventing elevations in blood pressure.\n\n",

This increase in renal APA at week 10 may serve to degrade AngII and temporarily protect this model. However, AngII levels in high-salt DSS rats at week 10 did not change despite increased APA activity. Since it is known that a high-salt diet increases intra-renal angiotensinogen levels in DSS rats, elevations in AngII levels would be anticipated [58]. Presumably these increases in AngII exceed the degradative capacity of APA and hypertension results. High-salt intake promotes glomerulosclerosis in the DSS rat with increased mesangial matrix including mild fibrosis or hyper-cellularity at week 10. Expansion of glomerular size and hyalinization are observed with advancing weeks. Severe tubulointerstitial damage with tubular dilation and arteriosclerosis with thrombi were also observed at week 18. There are a number of reports indicating increased glomerulosclerosis with advancing hypertension in DSS rats. The inhibition of RAS activity by ACE inhibitors or ARBs is known to reduce glomerular injury irrespective of the antihypertensive effects in DSS rats, suggesting that local AngII plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis [60]. The AngII produces glomerulosclerosis through various mechanisms including enhanced cellular proliferation and over expression of chemotactic factors and cell adhesion molecules. The low-salt DSS rat showed no histopathological renal injury.\n\n",

With advancing weeks APA staining decreased in the severely injured glomeruli and finally disappeared. Thus, sclerotic glomeruli progressively lose the ability to express APA. We also noted hyalinization of glomeruli in DSS rats over time that could have contributed to this failure to produce APA. The degree of APA immunostaining in the glomeruli, or elsewhere in low-salt DSS rats, did not change over weeks. As previously mentioned Kobori and colleagues [58] showed that high-salt diet increased intrarenal angiotensinogen levels in DSS rats. Taken together these reports suggest that over time this model suffers increased glomerular damage primarily due to progressive elevations in AngII levels that occur as the capacity to synthesize APA diminishes. Although this scenario appears to be unusually simple as an explanation it is a reasonable initial hypothesis that will hopefully encourage the additional investigations necessary to validate, modify, or reject this notion.",

Broughton-Pipkin and Symonds [62] compared AngII levels in umbilical arterial and venous blood, and maternal venous blood during normal pregnancy and preeclampsia. They showed that the level of AngII in umbilical venous blood is higher than that in umbilical arterial blood in both normal pregnancy and preeclampsia, and the levels in both umbilical venous and maternal venous blood in cases of severe preeclampsia were also much higher than those of normal pregnancy. The gradient of AngII between umbilical venous and arterial blood indicates the involvement of placental ACE in AngII production in the feto-placental unit.

Of note, maternal serum APA activity in early preeclampsia patients (mild preeclampsia) were higher than those seen in normal pregnancy patients [63]. However, as the severity of preeclampsia increased, APA activity decreased, ultimately becoming lower than that measured during normal pregnancy. It is likely that increased APA activity in maternal sera before, and immediately after, the appearance of preeclampsia is in response to increased production of AngII from the fetus, thus representing a response to counter such increases. If the APA levels of maternal serum reflect the production rate in the placenta, then the decreased serum APA levels noted during severe preeclampsia could signify placental damage due to angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction. Thus, the trophoblastic degeneration seen during severe preeclampsia may be due to a failure in APA production. In this way normal levels of APA activity could act to protect the mother; while the drop in APA activity during preeclampsia permits increased AngII levels in the feto-placental circulation that can leak into maternal circulation resulting in hypertension.",

            "text": "It is well established that treatment with ACE inhibitors, and/or an ARB, can be lethal to the fetus during human pregnancy given that molecules with molecular weights less than 5\u20138 kDa can pass through the feto-placental barrier. The mechanism of action appears to be the transfer of these drugs from the mother to the fetus resulting in profound hypotension in the feto-placental circulation, thus demonstrating a vital and necessary role for AngII in the feto-placental unit [66]. At present there is no adequate treatment for severe preeclampsia short of terminating the pregnancy. The ultimate goal concerning the control of preeclampsia is to focus treatment on maternal hypertension without influencing fetal blood pressure, and to avoid the fetal hypertension that occurs due to incremental AngII levels resulting from utero-placental hypoperfusion. Since APA has a molecular weight of 109 kDa and does not cross the placenta it may be a candidate for the treatment of preeclampsia. Along these lines, the intravenous administration of human recombinant APA decreased blood pressure in SHR at a dose similar to that conventionally used with sodium nitrate (unpublished data), supporting the argument that APA, or an APA-like compound, may be efficacious as an antihypertensive agent.",

Even higher elevations in serum APA have been reported if the woman is elderly, hypertensive, or receiving HRT [69]. Since plasma AngII levels appear to be unchanged [70], or reduced [71], with age in healthy women it could be that the elevated APA levels seen with hypertension are in response to increases in circulating AngII and represent an attempt to offset the resulting rise in blood pressure. This notion is supported by the observation that plasma AngII levels decline over time in hypertensive patients [71].",

[72] have shown that adult female normotensive DSS rats maintained on a low-salt diet become hypertensive after ovariectomy. Thus, the ovariectomized DSS rat shows promise as a useful model of postmenopausal hypertension. These investigators also reported that increased RAS activity contributed to the development of hypertension, and estrogen protects against this process. Thus, HRT enhanced APA activity might contribute to the observed reduction in circulating AngII levels. This hypothesis is in need of further testing.",

However, studies of this syndrome have failed to produce a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenesis and hence appropriate treatment. There is a need for appropriate animal models that develop HF based on the same cardiovascular dysfunctions seen in humans. Such models will greatly facilitate our understanding of disease progression and provide insights into appropriate treatment. Inoko et al. [73] reported a progression to HF due to severe renal dysfunction in DSS rats placed on an 8% NaCl diet for 6 weeks. Findings from our laboratory utilizing DSS rats suggest the likely involvement of APA as a mechanism of hypertension. Given that APA is a very potent hypotensive agent in SHRs, and is in fact comparable to nitroprusside in this regard (Ishii et al. submitted), [74], APA holds promise as a treatment for HF.",
