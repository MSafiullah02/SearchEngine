The common theme will be to minimize unnecessary interactions while maintaining high-quality treatment by integrating novel technologies such as telemedicine. Telemedicine was developed to allow health care professionals to treat patients in remote locations. Now it will have widespread use.(a)ImmediateiEnhancing a sense of security: It is essential that patients and staff feel safe. To this end, each clinic will need multiple hand sanitation booths, weekly staff testing for SARS-CoV-2, and identifiable signs (eg, SARS-CoV-2\u2013negative tested).iiMinimizing patient waiting times for physicians: Most centers now have electronic data and measurements for waiting times. We suggest personalization of physician\u2013patient time interactions on the basis of behavioral analyses.iiiTelemedicine: While the initial diagnosis needs to be in-person with protective measures, most follow-up visits could be performed via telemedicine. Medical insurers will need to consider reimbursement fees for this approach.ivPersonal protective equipment (PPE): Each facility will have to decide which invasive procedures require PPE and what kind of PPE to use.vAs there is some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted via the feco-oral route [5], we suggest performing prostate biopsies and urodynamics on a day surgery basis.\n(b)Intermediate term (1\u20132 yr)iIntegration of patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) with telemedicine: Telemedicine creates distance between the patient and physician. In urology, many issues are very intimate and it is vital to establish adequate doctor-patient rapport.iiTelemedicine communication skills: As telemedicine is a new tool we will have to master communication via video.iiiIntegrated practice units (IPUs): The world of medicine is moving towards value-based medicine. What this essentially means is shifting the focus from the volume and profitability of services provided\u2014physician visits, hospitalizations, and procedures\u2014to the patient outcomes achieved [6]. As a field, we should seize the opportunities provided by telecommunication and technology to transform our approach.At the core of value transformation is changing the way we are organized. In urology, this requires a shift from the current organization by service to organization around the patient\u2019s medical condition. This structure is termed an IPU. In an IPU, a dedicated team made up of clinical and nonclinical personnel provides the full care cycle for the patient\u2019s condition. Many institutes already have multidisciplinary uro-oncology clinics, so moving to IPUs would be an easy transition.\n(c)Long term (>2 yr)iCreating a physical barrier between the main hospital and clinics: We may have a second or third wave of infection and we need to think of how to move outpatient clinics away from the main hospital.iiConnected clinics: The COVID-19 pandemic will enhance the development of novel tools for monitoring patients at home. These will use technology to inform personalized medicine and care (eg, daily home urine tests to change nutrition for stone formers).\n\n",
