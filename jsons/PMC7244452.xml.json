Nine studies evaluated the effect of vaccination with MLV (8 studies) and KV (1 study) vaccines on the natural occurrence of BRD in beef calves after conventional (5\u20138 months) weaning age.13\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22 MLV and KV vaccines included at least one of the following agents: bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV 1), BVDV 2, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), and parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3V). In all studies, vaccination occurred in the transition from weaning to arrival at the stocker/feedlot operation. Significant reduction of morbidity was reported in 75% (6/8) of the studies using MLV vaccination. Further, significant reduction of mortality was observed in 67% (4/6) of studies using MLV vaccination that reported mortality rates. Only one study evaluating the efficacy of KV vaccines reported significant reduction of BRD-associated morbidity and mortality.21 The introduction of BVDV-2, BCV, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in combination with MLV, and early vaccination (before weaning, before arrival) increased vaccination efficacy.22\nThere is strong and high-quality evidence that vaccination of beef calves around the time of weaning with MLV vaccines alone or in combination with M haemolytica/P multocida bacterin/toxoids is superior to vaccination with KV vaccines in reducing naturally occurring BRD morbidity and mortality after weaning.\n",

Similarly, overall preweaning dairy heifer BRD-associated mortality is 19%.43 The level of interference of colostrum-derived immunity at the time of vaccination can similarly affect clinical protection and efficacy of vaccination in dairy calves. Two studies evaluated the effect of vaccination of dairy calves between 3 days and 6 weeks of age, with single or 2 doses of a multivalent MLV vaccine on the natural occurrence of BRD between 1 and 3 months of age.17\n,\n44\n,\n45 Vaccination did not result in significant reduction of naturally occurring BRD morbidity and mortality in any of the studies. One study reported that 21% of the risk of BRD in young dairy calves was the result of failure in the transfer of passive immunity.46 Calves with a higher colostrum-derived BRSV and IBR antibodies had lower odds of developing signs of BRD compared with calves with lower titers. In another study, calves vaccinated with 2 doses of an intranasal (IN) multivalent MLV vaccine between 3 to 6 days and at 6 weeks of age demonstrated no difference in BRD signs but had less lung consolidation compared with calves vaccinated at 6 weeks, with a single dose of a subcutaneous (SC) MLV vaccine or unvaccinated calves.45\nThere is limited moderate quality evidence indicating that vaccination of young dairy calves with multivalent MLV vaccines is ineffective for reducing naturally occurring BRD morbidity and mortality.\n",
