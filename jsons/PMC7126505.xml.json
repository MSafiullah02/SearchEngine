            "text": "Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) causes hundreds of millions of dollars per year in losses to the cattle industry (Bowland and Shewen, 2000). The disease is associated with multiple bacterial and viral pathogens including Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine herpes virus (BHV) (Caswell, 2014, Moore et al., 2015). The most important bacterial species associated with BRDC is Mannheimia haemolytica, a member of the family Pasteurellaceae. M. haemolytica exists as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract of healthy cattle, from where it can descend into the lungs to cause pneumonia (Frank and Smith, 1983, Frank et al., 1993). Previous studies have shown the ability of M. haemolytica to colonize bovine tonsils for extended periods (Frank et al., 1993). Severe BRDC is often preceded by infection of the respiratory epithelium with viruses like BVDV-1, BRSV, BHV-1, or bovine coronavirus (Frank et al., 1993). The mechanisms by which these viral infections predispose the host to M. haemolytica are unclear. One possibility is that viral infections alter the respiratory epithelial lining to favor bacterial colonization (Selinger et al., 1981).",

Other members of the family Pasteurellaceae have been shown to produce biofilms in vitro. For example, the closely related porcine respiratory pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae forms biofilms within 4 h, under static growth conditions in vitro (Tremblay et al., 2013). The bovine respiratory pathogen H. somni can form biofilms that are thought to allow this commensal to persist on the bovine mucosa (Sandal et al., 2011, Elswaifi et al., 2012). The EPS in H. somni biofilms was found to consist largely of polysaccharides, which contribute to persistence of the bacteria in its biofilm state during systemic infection (Elswaifi et al., 2012). In a previous study, we showed that M. haemolytica will form biofilm on plastic in vitro, and that protein is the major constituent in the EPS (Boukahil and Czuprynski, 2015).",

To propagate the virus, confluent BBEC in a T75 flask were infected with virus and subsequently the viruses were concentrated using a procedure described previously (Eisfeld et al., 2014). To initiate viral infection, uninfected BBEC were seeded at a density of 105 per well in a 24 well plate. After incubation for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2, the cells were infected with 105 PFU of virus (MOI of 1) in DMEM-F12 media containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Because viral infection of cells is based on a Poisson distribution we assume that at an MOI of 1 63% of the BBEC cells were virally infected (Knipe and Howley, 2013). A control group of uninfected BBEC was included as a control. BBEC were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 until the first signs of CPE were observed (i.e. 12 h for BHV-1, 60 h incubation for BVDV-1, 72 h for BRSV). The cells were then fixed and used for the biofilm assay described above.",

To answer this question, we performed a minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay to test the effects of chlortetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, tulathromycin, and florfenicol on M. haemolytica biofilms formed on plastic and BBEC. Chlortetracycline and erythromycin exhibited the biggest increases in MBEC on cells versus plastic (8 and 16 fold, respectively).

Florfenicol showed no difference in MBEC for biofilms on polystyrene and BBEC, although the concentration needed was much greater than the other antibiotics tested. For comparative purposes we include MIC values for planktonic cells in Table 1. The MIC value for all antibiotics tested (planktonic state) were several-fold less than their respective MBEC values.

As with other bacterial species, M. haemolytica requires 48 h to form a biofilm in vitro. This incubation period poses technical challenges associated with controlling numbers of planktonic bacterial cells and maintaining the integrity of the underlying epithelial cells. One group of investigators used a transwell membrane barrier between the biofilm being formed and the underlying epithelial cells (Tran et al., 2014). Although this approach allowed the epithelial cells to survive, the lack of direct contact between the biofilm cells and epithelial cells offers limited insights into the likely process of biofilm formation in vivo. Other investigators have reported model systems that allow for direct contact between the bacterial and epithelial cells, however these studies used bacterial species that rapidly formed biofilms (i.e. 9 h) (Anderson et al., 2008). Incubation beyond 12 h resulted in detachment of the underlying eukaryotic cells due to the toxicity of bacterial products in the culture system. Our model is the first to report biofilm formation directly on host cells during incubation periods of up to 72 h (Supplementary Fig. S3). To allow the underlying epithelial cells to support the growing biofilm, we gently fixed the epithelial cells with glutaraldehyde, which is reported to have limited effects on the tertiary structures of proteins (Chui and Wan, 1997). Indeed, others have shown that the protein trypsin retains catalytic activity after being similarly treated with glutaraldehyde (Chui and Wan, 1997). We confirmed fixation had limited effects on the epithelial cells by showing equivalent adhesion of M. haemolytica cells to fixed and living epithelial cells (Fig. 2).\n",

            "text": "Our finding that mucin decreases biofilm formation is consistent with studies, which showed that mucin significantly decreased biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans and P. aeruginosa (Haley et al., 2014, Frenkel and Ribbeck, 2015). It has been proposed that mucin, the main glycoprotein of mucus, acts as an anti-biofouling agent that impairs pathogen colonization of epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract (Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004, Linden et al., 2008). We found that at mucin concentrations similar to those reported in vivo, biofilm formation was nearly eliminated (Fig. 3). There are several possible mechanisms by which mucin protects the epithelium from bacterial colonization. Bergstrom et al. showed that mucin-deficient mice had a greater commensal bacterial load in the intestinal epithelium when infected with the pathogen Citrobacter rodentium than did wildtype mice (Bergstrom et al., 2010). Mucin prevented over-colonization of commensal and pathogenic organisms alike, by enabling cilia to sweep away the bacterial cells (Bergstrom et al., 2010). A similar mechanism of bacterial clearance is believed to occur in the upper respiratory tract (Thornton et al., 2008). In humans, chronic oral disease leads to increased mucin levels, which in turn are thought to contribute to inflammation during infection (Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004). As infection proceeds, the resulting inflammation stimulates overproduction of mucin (Thornton et al., 2008). Consistent with this finding, one of the characteristic signs of severe M. haemolytica respiratory infection is excess mucus emanating from the nostrils of cattle (Poulsen and McGuirk, 2009). If mucin has antimicrobial properties, then the question remains as to why commensal bacteria can colonize the respiratory tract in humans and animals. This apparent paradox may be explained by evidence that mucin helps to maintain consistent levels of commensal bacteria while suppressing colonization by pathogenic bacteria (Frenkel and Ribbeck, 2015). Because M. haemolytica is regarded as part of the microflora in the upper respiratory tract of healthy cattle, perhaps mucin allows M. haemolytica to colonize at low levels, as a commensal biofilm.",

Standard antibiotic susceptibility assays may not reflect the susceptibility of bacterial cells enmeshed in a biofilm (Olson et al., 2002). Furthermore, bacterial cells in biofilms may have an increased mutation rate, and the close proximity of bacterial cells can facilitate transfer of antibiotic resistance, allowing resistant cells to emerge (Driffield et al., 2008). Some research laboratories have investigated antibiotic resistance by biofilms formed on abiotic surfaces to predict antibiotic doses that are effective in vivo (Hengzhuang et al., 2011). Here we showed that biofilm formation by M. haemolytica on epithelial cells enhanced antibiotic resistance relative to biofilm formation on polystyrene. One simple explanation for the enhanced resistance is that M. haemolytica cells in the extracellular matrix exuded by both biofilm cells and BBEC are physically shielded from the antibiotic. Hence, a greater amount of antibiotic is needed to kill these embedded bacterial cells.",
