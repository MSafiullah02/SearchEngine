            "text": "capacities and a suboptimal level of public health preparedness system, 16 out of 22 countries Ministries of Health have developed a national action plan against COVID-19 with the support of the regional office of WHO and other United Nation agencies. Further support including financial, manpower and logistical guidance has been provided by WHO regional office to countries in need. An additional unique challenge for the RMR is the major religious mass gathering events taking place, which pose unique risks to public health security. These religious gatherings take place in Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As with any infectious disease outbreak, the early detection of infection is considered the highest priority in order to isolate and apply preventative measures. In the EMR overall capacity is inadequate to rapidly detect and respond to the potential importation or local transmission of COVID-2019 virus. In addition, the laboratory capacities are limited with only 20 out of the 22 countries in the Region having a functioning reference laboratory with the ability to detect and confirm MERS-CoV and other high threat pathogens. But when it comes to detection of newly emerging pathogen, a lot of training and guidance with the provision of diagnostic kits and lab supplies will be required. A lot of challenges are faced by many countries when it comes to the purchase of new equipment's, diagnostic kits, and training staff on biosafety and biosecurity. Many EMR countries have taken steps to repatriate their citizens from China very early on and isolated them for 14 days on arrival. To curtail the pandemic of COVID-19, many countries around the world including EMR countries had adopted variable strategies for such prevention. But some countries were more aggressive than others in taking bold proactive steps to prevent the entry and spread of COVID-19 in their countries. KSA has taken such major steps as There is currently no standard therapy for COVID-19. There are possible therapeutic options such as lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine [8, 9] . In a randomized study of patients with laboratoryconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 99 received lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 had standard-care [8] .",

This annual mass gathering is one of the largest recurring mass gathering in the world taking place in KSA and thus is widely studied [2,3]. The number of pilgrimage had increased from 58584 in 1920 to 3,161,573 in 2012 [4]. As such this annual mass gathering brings the possibility of the propagation of respiratory infections [5]. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had taken unprecedented measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and these measures were taken ahead of any other countries around the globe. On February 27, 2020 and for the first time in 80 years and in the history of Muslim pilgrimage to the holy sites, KSA placed restrictions on inbound Umrah pilgrimage [6,7]. The first case of COVID-19 was reported by the Saudi Ministry of Health on March 2, 2020 in a citizen returning from Iran in the Qatif region, Eastern KSA and 51 contacts tested negative. There were multiple steps taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and with the cancelation of many congregation events in KSA including the book Fair and the Saudi Arabian International festival for Arab horses on March 5, 2020. In addition, the KSA suspended e-Visa program, placed ban on inbound travel of persons from COVID-19 affected countries, and restrictions on travel from and to the neighboring gulf countries, and on March 7, 2020 KSA limited international flights to the three major airports within the Kingdom. On March 7, 2020, KSA required SARS-CoV-2 negative-certificate for any arriving travelers. Since the initial cases were reported from Qatif region, this area was put on lockdown on March 5, 2020.
