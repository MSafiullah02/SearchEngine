For instance, the number of sequences in GenBank increases exponentially and as of August 2003 (Release 137) it contained over 33.9 billion nucleotide bases from 27.2 million individual sequences [1]. To store, characterize, and mine such a large amount of data requires many databases and programs hosted in high-performance computers. Until now, there have been several databases, for example GenBank [1], Uniprot [2], PDB [3], KEGG [4], PubMed Medline, etc., covering not only nucleotide and protein sequences but also their annotations and related research publications. The programs include those for sequence alignment, prediction of genes, protein structures, and regulatory elements, etc., some of which are organized into packages such as EMBOSS [5], PHYLIP [6], and GCG Wisconsin (http://www.accelrys.com/products/gcg_wisconsin_package/program_list.html).",

The programs themselves are even more complex in that they are implemented using a variety of programming languages and on different operating systems, are operated in different ways using input and output data in a wide range of formats. Biologists try to discover biological functions from sequences using informatics techniques but are frequently frustrated by the processes of searching for suitable tools, learning how to use these tools, and translating data formats between them.",

To build such an integrative informatics platform, workflow is recognized as a potential solution. Some existing efforts include Biopipe [8], BioWBI [9], Taverna [10], Wildfire [11], etc. All of them provide mechanism to integrate bioinformatics programs into workflows. Biopipe is based on programming language perl. It looks lack of user-friendly interface for building workflow so far. BioWBI and Tarverna use Web-Services for components to construct workflows. However, to convert a 3rd-party program into Web-Services, they lack of integrative GUI environment. Wildfire aims at using workflow to provide huge computing capability to bioinformatics application. However, there is no integrative environment provided for multiple users to collaborate in the same large-scale bioinformatics project. In this paper, we present a significant integrative informatics platform, Knowledge Discovery Environment of Bioscience (KDE Bioscience), which is supposed to provide a solution of integration of biological data, algorithms, computing hardware, and biologist intelligence for bioinformatics.",

However, since current biological researches generate such a large amount of data, that are usually far from complete and well-structured, it can be better to store them in flat files with a semi-structured format that allows for errors and redundancies. Additionally, biologists have become used to publishing their data on web pages that are usually in unstructured formats. Providing biologists with an easy-to-use bioinformatics platform requires the integration of sequence and annotation data in different formats from DBMS, flat files, and web pages.",

Furthermore, the uniform interface of KDE Bioscience makes a variety of algorithms transparent to the biologist.

It provides a simple solution to the integration of distributed computing resources. To support collaborative work, user and user space management provide facilities for multiple users to share data and workflows. As a result, several biologists can work concurrently on the same bioinformatics project without data collision. Moreover, the use of J2EE allows flexibility of architecture and portability of applications. Several UIs\u2014Java GUI, web page, and SOAP application program interface\u2014are presented to fit for various users\u2019 requirements.

With workflows, not only the analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences but also other novel calculations and simulations can be integrated. In this sense, KDE Bioscience makes an ideal integrated informatics environment for bioinformatics or future systems biology research.",
