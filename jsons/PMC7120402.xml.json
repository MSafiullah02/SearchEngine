It has been a companion to the human species since our inception, before we started our long journey out of Africa 60.000 years ago, and has shaped our population, genetics, and behaviors like no other organism [1, 2]. Malaria presentation ranges from a mild febrile illness to a life-threatening disease with multisystem organ failure. Severe malaria belongs in the intensive care unit due to the multitude of potential complications, remaining a major cause of mortality worldwide. In the context of a globalized community and changing climate, borders\u2019 relevance is ever decreasing. Critical care providers familiar with this disease will be equipped to deliver timely and appropriate care in the face of this changing epidemiology.",

Wherever there is year-round transmission, P. falciparum is usually primarily involved, and, although adults are usually immune, children remain vulnerable and accumulate most of the mortality. This is the case in sub-Saharan Africa, where the World Health Organization reports 90% of malaria deaths occur [8]. In other regions of Asia and Central and South America, transmission is intense but concentrated over a few months out of the year. As such, people remain susceptible into their adulthood, but since both P. falciparum and P. vivax have similar incidence, mortality is lessened.

These motile sporozoites are inoculated, circulate to the liver, and actively infect hepatocytes, causing asymptomatic liver infection (Fig. 13.3). Once they invade hepatocytes, they will mature over 7\u201310 days to produce schizonts. These schizonts rupture, releasing thousands of merozoites into the bloodstream that quickly invade erythrocytes, beginning the asexual erythrocyte stage (Fig. 13.3). Merozoites develop into trophozoites that will become schizonts over a period of 48 h in the cases of P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale, 72 h in the cases of P. malariae, and 24 h in the case of P. knowlesi. Schizonts will then rupture, causing hemolysis and releasing many merozoites with every cycle causing clinical illness. Some erythrocytic parasites will develop into sexual gametocytes. When taken up by the mosquito, a female and a male gametocyte have the capability of fusing to produce a zygote. After multiple steps, sporozoites are generated in the anopheline salivary glands, completing the cycle. P. vivax and P. ovale generate hypnozoites in the liver that can lead to recurrent disease months or years after the initial infection (Fig. 13.3).\n",

Erythrocytes that are infected with more mature stages of this parasite remain within small tissue vessels, including the brain. This process is termed cytoadherence, and it is thought to be caused by the expression of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (Pfemp1) in the erythrocyte membrane. Parasites avoid passing through the spleen where abnormal erythrocytes would be cleared while also being more likely to cause local tissue damage. This protein is member of the var family and continuously changes among more than 60 subtypes, impairing antigen recognition and host response [23, 24]. Moreover, subtypes of Pfemp1 may confer tissue specificity, as is the case with the affinity to endothelial protein C receptor and cerebral malaria [25]. The severity of disease is associated with both the increased parasitemia and a higher biomass of sequestered parasites [26].",

However, thick blood smears do not allow identification of erythrocyte morphology, helpful in species diagnosis, and are difficult for those with limited training. Giemsa-stained thin blood smear offers an improved means of characterizing parasite morphology, but the process is much less efficient than for thick smears. As such, thick smear is standard of care in areas of high endemic burden, while thin are reserved for areas in which there is more trained personnel, with more time available to them.
