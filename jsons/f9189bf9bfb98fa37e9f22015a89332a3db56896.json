For example, H2 and H4 subgroups, which have been 296 detected for more than four months from December 24, 2019 to May 5, 2020 ( Figure  297 4A), have more mutations with higher frequencies, but the highest mutation frequency 298 is only 0.486 at the position of 11083 ( Figure 4B , Table S6 ). From these phenomena, 299 it can be inferred that it takes a long time for the specific sites of each major subgroup 300 to be fixed, but it may be faster if the early population is small. In addition, there is 301 also the possibility that an ancestor strain evolved in four directions by obtaining the 302 specific mutations directly and produced the four current major haplotypes, so the 303 evolution time may be shorter, which seems to be consistent with the phenomenon 304 that four major haplotypes can be detected in two months ( Figure 4A ).
