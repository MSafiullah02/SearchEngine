Our findings are in keeping with those reported by Yilmaz et al.,14 who also identified development of ascites prior to LT as an independent risk factor for CA. Nonetheless, a smaller study reported that children and young adult LT recipients with postoperative CA had similar rates of ascites on pretransplant radiological imaging as those without CA.8 The main difference between this study and ours lies in the timing of the identification of ascites (anytime preoperatively in the latter), without being clear whether LT recipients in the first study had previously developed ascites.",

Similarly, a lower height\u2010for\u2010age z score at LT, which generally implies failure to thrive and malnutrition, was also significantly associated with a higher risk of postoperative CA. These results support reports describing pretransplant malnutrition in children as a risk factor for posttransplant morbidity.17 Given that the weight\u2010for\u2010age z score may underestimate the degree of undernutrition in children with chronic liver disease because of the effects of organomegaly and/or ascites, it is not surprising that no association was found between weight\u2010for\u2010age z score at LT and postoperative CA.",

Detection of chylomicrons in peritoneal fluid, obtained either through the peritoneal drain or through paracentesis, is considered the gold standard test for the diagnosis of CA.",

We found the recently proposed triglyceride cutoff to be insufficiently sensitive (31.25%) as a diagnostic tool. These findings suggest that the triglyceride cutoff may not be a reliable criterion to exclude the diagnosis of CA in fasting or partially fed pediatric LT recipients. Maldonado et al. reported similar findings when determining the biochemical parameters of chylous pleural fluid in patients with chylothorax, particularly in those fasting in the postoperative state.9 Peritoneal fluid should also be sent for cell count (lymphocyte predominance) and culture (negative).",

Although CA after LT is relatively uncommon, it was associated with prolonged hospital LOS and immediate postoperative morbidity. CA should be sought in children with increased peritoneal drain losses or ascites after LT, particularly in the younger population with a history of ascites and/or malnutrition before LT. Chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid appears to be a more sensitive test that overran arbitrary triglyceride cutoff values in children undergoing LT. Symptomatic management of CA with peritoneal drains and dietary interventions are highly effective first\u2010line treatment modalities in the majority of patients. Routine use of octreotide is not recommended or required. Early recognition and treatment of this unusual complication will shorten hospital LOS and reduce the degree of postoperative morbidity.",
