We attributed the infections to contact with an infected but potentially presymptomatic traveler from the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province. Our epidemiologic investigation was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Zhoushan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",

A 45-year-old teacher from Wuhan (person W) arrived on January 5 for the conference and joined persons A and D on January 6 for dinner, where they ate from common serving plates. After returning to Wuhan on January 7, person W experienced the onset of fever, cough, sore throat, and malaise on January 8. He visited a local hospital where, according to the patient's self-report, he was confirmed to have COVID-19 by a local office of the Chinese CDC. For person A and D, the only known potential exposures for SARS-CoV-2 were their dinner and conference attendance with person W (Figure) .",

Laboratory tests at the hospital indicated leukopenia, and a real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) test for influenza A and B viruses was negative. The patient was given an antipyretic and some traditional medicines commonly used in China. After 3 days, his fever subsided, but his cough persisted. On January 15, the patient went to a different hospital, where routine blood test results were unremarkable but a chest radiograph revealed bilateral invasive lesions. He was prescribed amoxicillin and levofloxacin for 3 days. Because his cough did not improve, he was hospitalized for further evaluation. When the treating physician learned that the patient had had contact with a visitor from Wuhan before symptom onset, a throat swab specimen was sent for rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 (1). On January 19, SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed at the laboratory of the Zhoushan CDC.",

In Sanya, he used over-the-counter medications for his dry cough, which did not improve. On January 19, after returning to Zhoushan, he was informed that his colleague (person A) had been diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; person D was then transported by ambulance to the local infectious diseases hospital for isolation and specimen testing.
