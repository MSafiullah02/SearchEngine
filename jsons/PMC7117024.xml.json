            "text": "Online public sentiment refers to the sum of various attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed via the Internet within a certain time and space, reflecting social conditions (Cao, Liu, Fang, Duan, & Li, 2014; Zhang, & Li, 2016). Online public sentiment on emergencies refers to how netizens use a network platform to express their opinions and views on emergencies (Soffer & Gordoni, 2017). Our study categorizes these emergencies as natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events. The evolution of online public sentiment on emergencies is a dynamic process and involves three main bodies: a government, network media, and Internet users (Wang, Li, & Li, 2016). If emergencies themselves drive public sentiment, then Internet users are the producers, and online media drives the development of public sentiment. The government, meanwhile, regulates and guides public sentiment and attempts to understand how it evolves to play an active role in guiding future public sentiment (An, 2019; Lan & Zeng, 2013; Xia, 2019). This process is driven by the public need to know the truth about events and a general sentiment of social justice, both of which require that the public receive adequate information. However, public sentiment has become progressively more complicated and uncertain over time, arousing widespread concern in academic circles.",

            "text": "Government and public netizens coexist in a social network. When an emergency occurs, online rumors spread quickly and take diverse forms, thereby affecting decision making and information dissemination via official media (McGregor, 2019). Tang, Chow, Breen, and Prigerson (2019) argue that to understand the relationship between individuals and the media during the spread of online rumors, it is necessary to construct a simulation model of how public opinion develops. To this end, Lebensztayn and Rodriguez (2013) use a Markov chain to depict the interactions between the spread of online public sentiment and official activities in order to simulate the propagation of crisis information in online media. They accomplish this through the utilization of a multi-agent modeling method, guided by the theory of complex adaptive systems and Repast and Netlogo platforms. They found that the media's initial authoritative release of information after an emergency has a substantial influence on the behavioral decisions of all social groups, making media a powerful tool for official management over a situation. Zhu and Li (2012), meanwhile, established a new public opinion communication and control model that starts from the network public opinion communication environment, compared an intervention and control group at the initial stage of public opinion formation, and verified the effectiveness of the control method through simulation. Other scholars carry out simulations of the evolution of public opinion based on complex multi-agent networks in order to verify the influence of each factor on the overall transmission and effect of various public opinions. Such studies adjust the parameters of influencing factors, such as governmental credibility, and examine the differences between individuals and the media (Zhao et al., 2012). Hegselmann and Krause (2002) proposed a dynamic and bounded Deffuant model based on an analysis of the characteristics of public opinion transmission among netizens within social networks, and they analyzed the relationship between the number of netizens and the speed of consensus formation. Utilizing actual interactions between network users, they proposed a network evolution model that comprehensively considers the influence between users, the trust threshold, and an individual persistence strategy that better portrays the actual evolution of online public sentiment. Hu and Dong (2016) used Netlogo simulation software to simulate the behavior of the government, media, and netizens after China's Weng'an Riot. The riot involved a siege of government buildings in Weng'an County, Guizhou Province, following the tragic death of a female student, and resulted in fire damage and physical destruction. They discovered the value of network environment attributes of government, media, Internet users, and other Internet subjects as well as the weight of their respective influences. That is to say, by changing the relationship intensity among subjects, the influence of changes in network relations among government, media, and Internet users on the dynamic evolution of network public opinions can be measured and analyzed.",

            "text": "To the end of understanding the transmission of online public sentiment, social network analysis (SNA) allows researchers to analyze the comprehensive or interconnected space formed as a result of the interactions among individual users, at individual and systemic levels. Therefore, SNA better explains the change in main bodies and how these factors affect the relationship structure of the overall social network. The formation and evolution of online public sentiment are inseparable from communication relationships between people, the topological structure of public opinion networks, and the relationships among various public opinion participants. Hridoy, Ekram, Islam, Ahmed, and Rahman (2015) propose that social network data are one of the most effective and accurate indicators for studying public sentiment since platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites are filled with people's opinions and comments. Examples include Twitter users\u2019 views on Barack Obama's Nobel Peace Prize nomination (Urban & Bulkow, 2013) and comments on Instagram and Flickr mentioning the word \u201cEbola\u201d (Seltzer, Jean, Kramer-Golinkoff, Asch, & Merchant, 2015). SNA is also a valuable tool for understanding perceptions of emergencies, though Wei-Wei-Dong, Qian, and Jie (2018)) are among the few scholars who have carried out research on this topic. Because of the complexity of influencing factors and the difficulty of obtaining adequate data, developing an accurate model is a challenge, and few studies have attempted to verify the results of theoretical research through case studies. Too much emphasis has been placed on unilateral changes in government attitudes, and fewer studies have focused on the effect of multiple agents such as network media and netizens in addition to governments (Zeng & Chen, 2018).",

The interactive influence problem is simulated, and Baidu index data is used to obtain a number of statements expressing public sentiment from a particular period of time to apprehend both the evolution of public sentiment and the effect of governance on that evolution. Then, using the method by which Sina Weibo analyzes social networks, the characteristics of the key node and the important actors in the network during an emergency are analyzed spatially to provide a scientific basis for the government to respond effectively to online public opinion.",

This allowed us to analyze the spatial propagation effect between 75 nodes for each of the 101 emergencies studied. If one node forwards or comments content to another node, the relationship value between those two nodes is 1. If the two nodes have no forwarded comments, then the relationship value is 0.

As online media has grown over time, so has media coverage of crisis events and network enthusiasm for public opinion on these incidents. However, even today, the density of all 101 emergencies is very low, indicating that communication between users about emergencies remains low, and the dissemination of information is still slow. This may be because microblogs are mostly used for entertainment; user participation behavior is relatively random, unlike that of communication subjects with limited information dissemination capabilities.",

Rather, the media has a significant role in guiding nodes during these two types of emergencies: Netizens obtain news on an event directly from official media, such as the People's Daily, in the early stages of an incident. Since they trust this media source, they then quickly spread public opinion by forwarding, commenting upon, and paying attention to official media sources. There are not many intermediate links in the network. As a result, public opinion does not fluctuate very much. After accidents and social security incidents, however, media is not always at the center of a network. Instead, netizens are active in the communication process, and individuals are likely to be the center of networks. This suggests that in these two types of emergencies, netizens are vulnerable to misinformation.",

Governments must pass information disclosure laws to clarify their responsibility to provide information to the public in emergencies. Meanwhile, an information exchange system between the government and the media, netizens, and other social groups should be established to correct and adjust the government information reporting system.

Second, an SNA method is used to analyze the characteristics of key node structures and the important actors in the network of public opinion communication during an emergency. Because of the complex factors affecting emergencies and the difficulty in obtaining data, the construction of the model is inaccurate, and the four types of emergencies are analyzed from a time perspective. By enriching the data, we hope to find, through the model, the distribution characteristics of the four types of emergencies and find the root causes of the evolution of public sentiment during emergencies.",

This would be beneficial to netizens as it would reduce loss of interest and improve the comprehensive management of online public sentiment. However, because of the limited ability to acquire data, this paper extracted 75 individuals in the study of the spatial structure of public sentiment evolution, and the data is relatively poor. Moreover, the time evolution model assumed many parameters to be linear, rather than actual changes, which are nonlinear. The accuracy and depth of the research need to be improved.",
