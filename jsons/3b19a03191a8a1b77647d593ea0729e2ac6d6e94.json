What is more significant is the absent mortality rate among these persons and, to our knowledge, the absence of patients with serious consequences. In a transversal observation made in Alghero, Sardinia, one of the \"red counties\" of Italy and one with the greatest concentrations of type 1 diabetics in the world, there is just 1 case reported, easily healed. This has been recently confirmed by the ISPAD 1 But what could be the explanation for this strange phenomenon? Traditionally 2 , the human immunity to foreign antigens depends critically on the balance of the Th1 and Th2 immunity. The Th1 immunity is mostly proinflammatory, mediated by T-lymphocytes and modulated by IL-6 and Interferon Gamma among the other molecules, and its mode of action is against pathogens that require internalization, like is the case of the Coronavirus 3 . The Th1 immunity is prevalent in the younger age, and this may at least in part explain the milder course of this viral disease in the youth versus Th2 immunity mediated by B-Lymphocytes and antibodies 4 . Type 1 diabetes has a Th1 autoimmunity pathogenesis, as Hashimoto's Thyroiditis or Coeliac disease, which frequently coexist 3 . It has been demonstrated that the \"insulitis\" of Type 1 diabetes is due to a tip of the immunity towards Th1, unrestrained by the Th2 which is mainly anti-inflammatory 5 .",
