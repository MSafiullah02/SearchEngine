Despite the authors' cautious conclusion that ivermectin \"warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans,\" the paper has excited widespread interest on medical and veterinary websites, which often incorrectly describe the drug as a treatment or cure for COVID-19.

The ivermectin PBPK model was initially developed to facilitate drug development for parasitic diseases including onchocerciasis and is a full model that allows prediction of tissue drug concentrations. The model has been independently verified. The predicted versus observed plasma profiles for ivermectin across clinical studies in the Mectizan NDA were well aligned, [7] indicating the base model is well defined. Furthermore, the PBPK model was able to predict ivermectin exposures in plasma, adipose and skin to within 1.3-fold of observed data in patients infected with Onchocerca volvulus [8] Simulations were performed using the Simcyp Simulator Version 19 Release 1. Ten virtual trials of 10 subjects aged 18-75 years (50 % female) were simulated using the Sim-NEurCaucasion population. In the simulation, high dose ivermectin (600 \u00b5g/kg) was administered orally, daily for 3 days and the virtual study carried on to 9 days. Dosing was in the Fed state and fraction unbound was 0.07 (plasma) and 0.13 (lung). Simulations for mean systemic plasma and lung tissue concentrations are shown in Figure 1 . Pharmacodynamic response is generally achieved by ensuring an appropriate duration of exposure above the minimum therapeutic concentration at the site of action. Even with most generous assumptions for clinical translation, the in vitro IC50 is >9-fold and >21-fold higher than the day 3 plasma and lung tissue simulated Cmax respectively, following a high dose ivermectin regimen of 600 \u00b5g/kg dose daily for 3 days.",

Picking and supporting the best therapies and preventions to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic head on is one of the scientific community's most urgent priorities. To assist this process, the clinical pharmacological relevance of in vitro or in vivo findings should be included. In vitro promise leads to clinical failure in the vast majority of cases, and in the volatile environment of the current pandemic, it is critical that we are sensitive to the implications of our communication and apply our resources to compounds most likely to succeed. A small window exists for the current data to have relevance for humans: we need to confirm the effective concentrations, assess if the class of macrocyclic lactones has similar target interactions, and understand the relevance of the concentrations used in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 to those likely to be achieved at the site of action, within a dose range considered to be well tolerated. Alternative routes could also be considered, although these present new formulation and safety challenges. Modelling and simulation approaches integrate in vitro findings with the in vivo situation and may serve to prioritize existing drugs that are candidates for repurposing.

            "text": "To the Editor, Yeo et al. and No\u00ebl aptly point out that published studies show that blood levels of ivermectin achieved during standard therapy are much lower than the concentrations we reported as inhibitory for SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture . Yeo et al. (2020) further explore the question via pharmacokinetic modeling (from Certara Inc.), while Noel (2020) voices concern that if high concentrations of ivermectin could be achieved, this would likely be toxic. These points are well made, and we are in agreement, but they do not address the reported mechanism of action of ivermectin (Yang et al., 2020) , and thereby fail to highlight a further vitally important reason to be very cautious in considering ivermectin as a therapeutic for viral infection in human patients.Ivermectin's key direct target in mammalian cells is a not a viral component, but a host protein important in intracellular transport (Yang et al., 2020) ; the fact that it is a hostdirected agent (HDA) is almost certainly the basis of its broad-spectrum activity against a number of different RNA viruses in vitro (Tay et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2020) . The way a HDA can reduce viral load is by inhibiting a key cellular process that the virus hijacks to enhance infection by suppressing the host antiviral response. Reducing viral load by even a modest amount by using a HDA at low dose early in infection can be the key to enabling the body's immune system to begin to mount the full antiviral response before the infection takes control.Pharmaceutical research efforts are currently underway to refine liquid formulations for intravenous administration of long-acting ivermectin, develop aerosol administration, and consider using ivermectin in combination with other agents to enhance efficacy at low doses. However, it is important to urge great caution in approaching the use of ivermectin in this simplistic way, precisely because ivermectin is a HDA. Because it targets a host component, it cannot be assumed that even doses lower than those discussed by Yeo et al. (2020) and Noel (2020) are safe in the context of a burgeoning viral infection, where a measured immune response is key to recovery. Clinical testing of ivermectin at any dose in the fight against viral infection must include intensive monitoring of patient well-being, to pre-empt any immunosuppressive or other adverse reactions as early as possible.Finally, it is critically important to remember that ivermectin as an antiviral is in a very early phase -under no circumstances should self-medication be considered without the guidance of a qualified physician, and especially not using therapeutics designed for veterinary purposes!",
