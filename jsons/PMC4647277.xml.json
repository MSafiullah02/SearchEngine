Since it\u2019s first reported in 1987, PRRS has become a severe threat to the swine industry worldwide [2]. The causative agent of PRRS, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was successfully isolated in EU and USA in 1991 and 1992, respectively [3, 4]. Surprisingly, the two genotypes showed sequence identity of only 60 % and a high degree of antigenic variation [5, 6]. In June 2006, an unparalleled, large-scale, PRRS outbreak occurred in China, leading to widespread infection which continues to be a serious problem today. Several studies have confirmed that a unique highly pathogenic strain of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) was responsible for this outbreak [7\u20139].",

The genome contains a cap structure at the 5\u2032 end, a poly (A) tail at the 3\u2032 end, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 un-translated regions (UTRs). Two overlapping open reading frames (ORF 1a and ORF 1b) occupy two thirds of the genome at the 5\u2032 end. These ORFs encode two large polyproteins that undergoes co-translational and post-translational processing to give rise to at least 14 non-structural proteins (nsps). ORFs 2\u20137 code for viral structural proteins GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5a, GP5, M, and N, respectively [11\u201314]. According to the recently accepted replication model for viruses of the order Nidovirales , PRRSV and other arteriviruses synthesize a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs as a mechanism to regulate the expression of structural or accessory proteins [15]. Base pair interactions between the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) located at the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence and the complement of body TRSs presented upstream of each gene, have been shown to be essential for this process [16].",

            "text": "It is well recognized that due to the genetic diversity of the PRRSV strains, none of the current vaccines can completely protect against PRRSV infections. For PRRSV vaccines, the efficacy of protective immunity is usually assessed by the reduction in viremia after challenge with a virulent virus [17, 18]. Sufficient amount of neutralizing antibodies may prevent the infection, but cannot clear the virus in blood during the course of the infection. Therefore, vaccine immunity relies on the induction of the protective cell-medicated immune responses in prevention against PRRSV infection [19, 20]. CD4+CD8+ double positive T (DPT) cells are the main effectors of adaptive cellular immune response and essential to clear viral infection [21]. IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells are mainly DPT cells and whose levels are correlated with the host ability prevent PRRSV infection [22].",

In order to increase the efficacy of the vaccine, an alternative approach is to co-deliver cytokines to up-regulate the immune response of vaccine antigens. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine and has been used as an adjuvant to enhance immune response of PRRSV vaccines [23, 24]. In addition, IL-4 may positively modulate vaccination mediated clearance of PRRSV [22, 25]. In this study, porcine Interleukin-4 (pIL-4) gene was inserted between the N gene and the 3\u2032-UTR of a live attenuated PRRSV infectious clone, along with a copy of the transcription regulating sequence for ORF6 (TRS6), to create a recombinant PRRSV. The growth characterization and genetic stability of the recombinant virus was first analyzed in vitro. Further, recombinant virus was injected into piglets to evaluate its potential role for improving vaccine efficacy in protection against HP-PRRSV infection.",

This approach had particular advantage of minimizing the effects of expression and post-translational modification of viral proteins [33], and a series of recombinant PRRS viruses have been constructed using this approach [33\u201337]. In this study, the pIL-4 gene was inserted between N gene and 3\u2032-UTR of a live attenuated PRRSV infectious clone using a similar strategy.

Conversely, however, pigs that received PRRSV ORF7 DNA vaccine plus pIL-4-encoded plasmids did not develop any improved humoral and cellular immune responses [39]. In present study, recombinant virus expressing pIL-4 did not significantly enhance the protective immune response after vaccination. Thus, observations on the adjuvant effect of pIL-4 on PRRSV vaccine were inconsistent, which may be related to the species. Porcine IL-4 cannot be used as immunological adjuvant since it was reported that IL-4 plays a different role in pigs than in mice and humans, and porcine IL-4 blocks antibody production and also suppresses antigen-stimulated proliferation of B cells [40]. Another potential reason may be attributed to insufficient expression levels of IL-4 or inefficiency of IL-4 in potentiating anti-PRRSV immunity in vivo. In the absence of adequate amount, IL-4 cannot work efficiently as adjuvant to enhance immunity efficacy or prevent PRRSV infection [41]. Thus, additional studies on IL-4 as an adjuvant are required in different types of PRRSV vaccine as well as in other veterinary vaccines to evaluate its adjuvant property.",

Our data showed that the frequency of total CD3+ T subpopulations of pigs from all groups was relatively stable during experimental period (Table 2). Conversely, a rapid down-regulation of CD4+CD8+ double positive T (DPT) cells was observed in the challenged control group after HP-PRRSV (HuN4) infection, as previously reported [42, 43]. These results suggest one mechanism of the PRRSV-mediated delay in initiation of virus-specific adaptive immunity is by altering frequency of important lymphocytes early post-infection. In addition, we also observed that DPT cells in the recombinant virus group were markedly higher than the parental virus group at 3 and 7 DPC. Meanwhile, mean IL-4 level in the serum of group vaccinated with recombinant virus was significantly higher than that from parental virus group at 7DPC (Fig. 4b). IL-4 is a mediator of DPT cells cross-talk leading towards the development of immunity against an infectious pathogen [44], and IL-4 had a potent positive influence on the generation of DPT cells originally cloned from CD4+CD8\u2212 T lymphocytes [45, 46]. Our results also indicated that the higher level of IL-4 may be helpful to increase the DPT ratio in the serum.",

A live attenuated PRRSV vaccine that induced high IFN-\u03b3 secreting cell frequencies protected pigs against viremia [48, 49]. In this study, piglets immunized with CH-1R strain did not produce higher levels of IFN-\u03b3, conversely, higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 were found in piglets infected with HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain (Fig. 4a). Nonetheless, CH-1R strain can offer protection against clinical disease after HP-PRRSV HuN4 infection, and this observation is consistent with our previously published work [50, 51]. Therefore, the role of IFN-\u03b3 in the process of the immune protection to CH-1R vaccination is not clear and need further investigation.",
