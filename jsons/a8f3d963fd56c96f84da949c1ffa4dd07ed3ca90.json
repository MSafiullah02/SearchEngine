In this study, we found that high concentrations of MCP-1 and TGF-\u03b21 were produced in Figure 3 . Detection of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs and other organs and tissues by IHC. The MAbs against human MCP-1, TGF-\u03b21, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, respectively, were used to detect the expression of MCP-1 (a-i to a-viii), TGF-\u03b21 (b-i to b-viii), IL-1\u03b2 (c-i to c-viii), IL-6 (d-i to d-viii), and TNF-\u03b1 (e-i to e-viii) in monocytes/macrophages and pneumocytes (a-i to e-i), bronchial epithelial cells (a-ii to e-ii), bronchial serous gland epithelium (a-iii to e-iii), gastric parietal cells (a-iv to e-iv), myocardial cells (a-v to e-v), distal convoluted renal tubules (a-vi to e-vi), pancreatic islet (a-vii to e-vii), and sweat gland cells (a-viii to e-viii) in the SARS patients. All sections were counter-stained with haematoxylin the SARS-CoV-infected ACE2-expressing cells, suggesting that these two PICs may play major roles in the pathogenic mechanism of ALI. MCP-1 can act as a chemotactic factor to induce the migration of monocytes/macrophages from the bloodstream to the affected sites to combat the invading pathogens. However, these cells can also attack uninfected bystander cells. Microscopic examination of the SARS Under stimulation by some PICs (eg TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-\u03b1, etc), macrophages become proliferative and/or activated [30] , which in turn produces more PICs, leading to further immuno-mediated damage of the tissues in the host [31] .

SARS-CoV-infected cells produce high levels of PICs in order to combat the invading virus. However, the overproduced PICs may also attack the host cells, including both the infected and the uninfected cells, resulting in significant ALI and ARDS. The elevated levels of PICs in blood released from the SARS-CoV-infected cells and the uninfected cells stimulated by viral antigens or some PIC-regulatory factors, eg nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) and p38 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase) [39] [40] [41] , may damage the cells in the lungs and other organs, eg small intestine, kidney, adrenal gland, liver, and brain, etc. In addition, blood hypo-oxygenation due to ARDS and disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting from impairment of microvessel endothelial cells may further damage the structure and function of different PICs also damage the host cells. Some of the PICs, eg monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), attract monocytes in blood to migrate to the alveolar cavities, where the monocytes are stimulated by other PICs to become proliferative and/or activated macrophages (M ). The activated macrophages can produce more PICs and may transmit SARS-CoV to other sites. Some of the PICs, including TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-\u03b1, may induce apoptotic death of the epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and lymphocytes, or mediate pulmonary fibronosis, resulting in ALI and ARDS. The cell-free and M -associated SARS-CoV in the blood can be transmitted from the lung to other organs to infect the ACE2-expressing cells in the local sites. More PICs are produced and the level of PICs in the blood is rapidly elevated, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.

Human T lymphocytes lack ACE2 expression [18, 43] and therefore they may not be permissive to SARS-CoV replication. Furthermore, no significant CPE in T lymphocytes has been observed in the autopsy tissues of SARS patients [12] . We believe that the rapid depletion of T lymphocytes may be caused by overproduced PICs because the increase of blood PIC levels correlates with the decrease of T lymphocytes in the blood of SARS patients [22, 44] . As discussed above, some of the PICs may enhance T-lymphocyte apoptosis [32] [33] [34] .

However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV infection induces increased expression of PICs in the infected cells in SARS patients."}, {"text": "Moreover, immunodeficiency due to T-cell lymphopenia is unlikely to be the primary cause of acute syndrome and death. Unlike SARS-CoV, HIV can directly infect and replicate in CD4 + T lymphocytes, resulting in rapid death of these cells [46] . Even so, HIV infection does not cause acute disease. HIVinfected individuals take several years to progress to AIDS and opportunistic infection is the main cause of death in patients with HIV/AIDS [47] . Since the elevated levels of PICs may be the major mediators of the exaggerated immune responses that cause ALI and multi-organ dysfunction in SARS patients, the use of immunosuppressive agents may effectively inhibit the production and function of PICs and reduce the severity of ALI. Corticosteroids were the treatment of choice of SARS during 2003-2004. However, several groups reported that early application of large doses of corticosteroids with Ribavirin, a non-specific antiviral drug, for treating SARS patients did not show significant clinical benefits [48, 49] and even caused serious adverse effects, eg osteonecrosis [50] and aspergillosis [13] , though the data were not obtained from well-designed double-blind, randomized, and placebocontrolled clinical trials. One concern is that corticosteroids may non-specifically suppress the function of most immuno-modulators rather than specifically inhibit the activities of those causing harmful inflammation. Therefore, specific regimens may be designed to include antagonists specifically against the individual PICs, eg MCP-1 and TGF-\u03b2, that are highly expressed in the SARS-CoV-infected cells and in elevated levels in blood, plus antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients with SARS. Some drugs that selectively block pro-inflammatory cytokines or their cell receptors may also be used for SARS treatment [51] . The phenomenon of the rapidly increased levels of PICs in blood and their positive correlation with the severity of ALI has also been observed in patients who have been infected with other viruses, eg avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 [27, 28, 52] . This suggests that up-regulation of PIC expression induced in the virus-infected cells may be common mediators of ALI and ARDS in patients who have been infected with viruses via the respiratory pathway. Therefore the anti-PIC strategy may also be applied, in combination with the specific antiviral therapeutics against the corresponding viruses, for the early treatment of these infectious diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 241, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 441, "end": 445, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1016, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1020, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1106, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1826, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2069, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2073, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2074, "end": 2077, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ".
