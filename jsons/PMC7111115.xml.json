Many proteins are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane or the bacterial plasma membrane through a conserved channel, formed by a heterotrimeric protein complex (called the Sec61p complex in eukaryotes and the SecY complex in bacteria and archaea). The resting the channel is impermeable to ions and water (Saparov et al., 2007). Channel opening requires the insertion of the translocating polypeptide chain, with the signal sequence intercalated into the lateral gate. Structural rearrangements of the channel must occur before the translocation substrate can insert. Here we show that the energy required for these conformational changes may be provided by the binding of non-translating ribosomes or of the ATPase SecA. In their presence purified SecY complexes, reconstituted into planar membranes, exhibit massive ion channel activity, suggesting that channel partner binding prepares the channel for the subsequent insertion of a translocating chain. The ion flow is likely reduced when the translocating protein occludes the channel.",

The dimeric enzyme functions via a two domain sequential intramolecular electron transfer from a molybdoterin cofactor to a heme b5 type redox center followed by the subsequent intermolecular reduction of two equivalents of cytochrome c. We have previously shown the utility of electron transfer initiation via the photooxidation of Ru(bpz) labeled cytochrome c in reaction with cytochrome b5, and here extend this method to the electron transfer between sulfite oxidase and cytochrome c. Laser excitation of a complex between reduced sulfite oxidase and Ru-39-cyt c leads to rapid photooxidation of heme c, followed by intracomplex electron transfer from heme b of sulfite oxidase to heme c with a rate constant of 1.0 x 104 s-1. As the ionic strength is increased, the complex dissociates and a slower bimolecular reaction is observed.",

            "text": "Splice variation can modify Slo traffic by intracellular retention but splicing role in polarized targeting is unknown. In Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, expressed Slo is targeted to the apical surface, whereas in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE14o\u2212) cells channel activity was reported at the basolateral membrane. Here, we tested the hypothesis that splice variation can explain this difference. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy and specific antibodies, we confirmed that in MDCK cells endogenous Slo is mainly expressed at the apical surface; while 16HBE14o\u2212 cells showed expression at both apical and basolateral surfaces. RT-PCR demonstrated that 16HBE14o\u2212 cells have robust expression of a 29 amino acid spliced exon (SV29) but not MDCK cells where its expression was minimal. The role of this spliced exon was tested using viral constructs of Slo attached to EGFP with and without SV29 (Slo-EGFP and Slo-SV29-EGFP). After viral infection of MDCK cells under non-saturating conditions, Slo-EGFP showed apical expression, meanwhile, Slo-SV29-EGFP was also expressed in the basolateral surface suggesting an intrinsic basolateral signal in SV29. Furthermore, fusion of SV29 to a classical apically targeted protein -the non-related neurotrophin receptor p75- caused its targeting to both apical and basolateral surfaces of MDCK cells. Interestingly, expression of Slo-EGFP lacking SV29 in 16HBE14o\u2212 cells resulted in expression at both surfaces indicating that the particular cell machinery also plays a role in directing polarized targeting. Consistent with this view, deletion of the reported Slo apical signal analyzed in cortical collecting duct kidney cells did not result in loss of apical expression in MDCK cells. Thus, our data indicate that SV29 contains an intrinsic signal for Slo basolateral targeting in MDCK cells and that specific cell machinery also plays a role in targeting.",

Identifying more beta-barrels is of great interest because their myriad functions and accessibility make them tempting targets for novel vaccine and therapy development. We have predicted several genes that encode beta-barrel proteins in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 using a prediction algorithm developed in this lab. We are currently characterizing the gene product of one candidate, ompL, which was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). OmpL was found to be associated with the outer membrane fraction using differential solubilization to selectively isolate the proteins of the outer and inner membranes. OmpL was overexpressed into inclusion bodies, which were subsequently denatured with 8 M urea, and then purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). OmpL was refolded in a mixed detergent system of 3.5 mM SDS (sodium dodecyl-sulfate) and 30 mM DDM (n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltopyranoside). Changes in OmpL\u2019s mobility through SDS-PAGE suggest that the protein refolded into a native-like conformation as has been observed for other outer membrane proteins. We have determined, via spectropolarimetry, that this protein is beta-sheet rich when refolded. Refolding OmpL in SDS/DDM also caused the tryptophan fluorescence emission to blue-shift slightly and increased its intensity more than two-fold compared to OmpL in SDS alone. OmpL will be inserted into liposomes for further characterization which includes assessing binding to the bilayer via tryptophan fluorescence quenching and characterizing pore formation via liposome swelling assays; several other candidates will be cloned and similarly characterized. The results from this prediction and screening will then be used to generate a public database of outer membrane proteins and their properties.",

We use a thermodynamic approach to rationalize the effect of detergent on protein stability (see e.g. Josse et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2002).

Prestin is an important component of this motor and is a member of the SLC26A anion transporter family. Prestin greatly increases anion (mainly chloride) movement into and out of, as opposed to through, the membrane. The prestin-associated charge movement (q) can be monitored with voltage-clamp and is affected by membrane lipids. Increasing membrane cholesterol shifts the q/V function ~ 50 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, possibly related to increases in membrane stiffness. The voltage shift shows a saturating concentration dependence and, over time, there is a decrease in total charge moved (presumably from cholesterol induced increase in prestin endocytosis). Decreasing membrane cholesterol shifts the q/V function ~ 50 mV in the depolarizing direction with no effect on the amount of charge moved. Increasing membrane docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) shifts the q/V function in the hyperpolarizing direction < 15 mV. Intriguingly, DHA increases total charge moved (as opposed to decreasing it with cholesterol), raising the possibility that DHA promotes larger conformational changes allowing more chloride to move in and out of the membrane. The results demonstrate lipid-protein interactions are important for the functioning of the membrane-based motor. Similar lipid-protein interactions involving cholesterol and DHA have been observed for rhodopsin function.",

In the past penetration of water, metal ions, and protons into model unperturbed lipid bilayers have been accessed by X-ray, EPR, and NMR as well as by molecular dynamics simulations. However, these parameters are likely to be different in the vicinity of membrane proteins. Here we describe mapping of proton gradient and local dielectric properties along the single transmebrane \u03b1-helix formed by WALP peptide inserted into anionic DOPG (1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]) bilayers. A series of cysteine WALP mutants were modified with pH-sensitive thiol-specific spin label IMTSL that occupies the volume comparable to that of phenylalanine. This unnatural side chain exhibits pH-dependent EPR spectra allowing us to determine the probe pK\na and corresponding Gibbs free energies from a series of EPR titration experiments. The surface potential of DOPG was determined from titration of spin-labeled pH-sensitive phospholipids we have recently synthesized. Effects of solvent dielectric constant on Gibbs free energy of the label protonation were calibrated in a series of titration experiments in water/ iso-propanol mixtures. The combination of these data allowed for separating electrostatic and dielectric contributions to protonation of WALP side chains. Additional EPR oxygen accessibility measurements demonstrated that the position of the probe within the lipid bilayer is only slightly affected by the changes in its ionization state and is within 10% of the depth of the nonprotonated WALP side chain.",

The spike glycoprotein S from SARS-CoV is a surface glycoprotein that mediates viral entry by binding to the cellular receptors and induces membrane fusion, and has been classified as a Class I transmembrane glycoprotein. Class I viral proteins contain a hydrophobic region denominated as the fusion peptide and other hydrophobic region immediately adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain denominated as the pre-transmembrane domain. Although the exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV enters the host cell has not been elucidated, it is most likely similar to other coronaviruses. The fusion peptides interact with and insert into target membranes since this region represents a surface patch with high bilayer-to-water transfer free-energy values. Fusion peptides also participate in inducing lipid rearrangements giving place to hemifusion and pore formation and are also involved in pore enlargement. While much progress has been made in understanding the implication of fusion peptides in the membrane fusion process, available data concerning the fusion peptide of coronaviruses, particularly in the case of SARS-CoV, are scarce. In the present work we identify and report on the determination of the secondary structure and the interaction with model membranes of a peptide pertaining to the fusion domain of SARS-CoV, the structural changes which take place in both, the peptide and phospholipid molecules, induced by membrane binding and interaction with the lipid bilayer through a series of complementary experiments such as leakage, fusion and aggregation. Moreover, we show that SARS-CoV FP strongly partitions into phospholipids membranes and can be localized at different depths depending on the phospholipid composition of the vesicles.",

Those protein domains are capable of assembling in two strikingly different membranes: mammalian membranes that contain up to 40% of cholesterol and insects membranes that contain shorter unsaturated lipids and no cholesterol. Recently, it was shown that mutations in the transmembrane domain of the Sindbis virus E2 protein produce deferential alterations in the protein association with the lipid bilayer: some mutants were able to grow in insect cells, but not in mammalian cells [1,2]. The Sindbis virus with STM-16 deletion mutation of the E2 transmembrane domain shows the most pronounced differential growth in mammal and insect sells. In the attempt to understand constraints placed upon membrane spanning domains for correct integration into the bilayer we have investigated the interaction of synthetic peptides mimicking wild type transmembrane domain of the E2 glycoprotein and its mutants with lipid bilayers. The phospholipid composition was chosen to represent mammalian and insects\u2019 membranes. Results of EPR spin-labeling experiments show that STM-16 peptide adopts a transmembrane configuration in bilayers with lipid composition mimicking that of insects. In mammalian cell mimicking membranes that contain cholesterol the STM-16 peptide aggregates at the surface of the bilayer.",

The crystal structure of the ENTH domain showed that PIP2 helped the formation of helix 0 at the N terminus that was not present in the absence of PIP2. We used site-directed spin labeling EPR to determine the membrane-bound structure of the N terminus of the ENTH domain. Our data confirmed that the N terminus of the ENTH domain inserted into the membrane as an \u03b1-helix with an angle of degree 23. Very interestingly, the EPR results showed that helix 0 could oligomerize in the membrane in an anti-parallel fashion.

We have discovered a novel approach to target acidic tumors in vivo by employing the pH-selective insertion of a membrane peptide, pHLIP (pH (Low) Insertion Peptide). This 36 amino acid peptide is soluble at physiological pH, while at acidic pH, the transmembrane helix predominates, making the translocation of cell-impermeable molecules linked to its C-terminus through the membrane possible. Our goal is to define the properties of cell-impermeable cargo molecules linked to pHLIP that set the limits on the use of this novel delivery system. To accomplish our objective, we use the wide range of properties that can be obtained using peptides linked to or continuous with the C-terminus of pHLIP. These peptides follow a host-guest model where single amino acids are modified one at a time, allowing us to efficiently vary polarity, charge, shape and size. We have already successfully translocated such a polar cyclic peptide (LogP of ~3). The unique properties of pHLIP made it attractive for the development of a novel class of delivery peptides for the transport of therapeutic and diagnostic agents to acidic tissue sites associated with various pathological processes in vivo.",

Here we report a study of a hydrophobic peptide that contains either an asparagine (N) or a leucine (L) residue in the 12th position of an otherwise hydrophobic segment of 20 amino acids. These peptides are fully \u03b1-helical in detergents. In SDS polyacrylamide gels, several variants of the L12 peptide migrated as monomers of about 3\u20134, 000 Da. However, the N12 peptides always migrated at apparent molecular weights of 7\u201312, 000, suggesting dimers or trimers. In sharp contrast, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments in detergent solution showed little evidence of dimerization of N12 under any conditions. Experiments were performed with several variants of N12 and L12 labeled on their amino termini with the dyes fluorescein, TAMRA, Cy3 or Cy5. Experiments were done at concentrations ranging from 25 nM to 50 \u03bcM and at acceptor to donor ratios from 1:1 to 10:1. SDS concentrations ranged from 3 to 150 mM and experiments in a dozen other detergents were also done. We conclude that N12 is monomeric in all detergents, despite the fact that it appears to migrate as a dimer in SDS gels. Finally, we performed in situ FRET experiments on the bands in polyacrylamide gels. In the gel, there was no excess FRET observed for the slower N12 bands relative to L12 bands. The polar asparagine residue mimics dimerization by decreasing electrophoretic mobility. We hypothesize that the polar residue in the otherwise hydrophobic helix alters the interactions with detergent. Physical differences in the peptide-detergent micelles, such as shape and stoichiometry, are responsible for the altered migration of the N12 peptides.",

However, there are doubts and uncertainties of whether the micelle topology is altering the structure and interactions of membrane proteins, especially when these interactions are weak and can be modulated by different lipid or detergent environments. We used the TM domain of wild type and A391E mutant FGFR3 as an example of weak dimerizing peptides to study how their behavior would change in detergent (SDS). These peptides had been thoroughly characterized in liposomes and in surface supported bilayers. Hill coefficient analysis shows that the dimerization of WT and A391E TM domain in phospolipid bilayers follow the theoretical curve described by a single association constant, though different for WT and A391E. In detergent, both peptides form only dimers and no higher order oligomers, as probed by FRET analysis. However, Hill coefficient analysis indicates anti-cooperativity in WT dimer interactions, suggesting multiple dimer states with different binding constants. At the same time, the A391E mutant behavior is closer to the theoretical trend described by a single binding constant. The observed heterogeneity of the dimeric state can explain the broad peaks in the NMR spectra of those peptides.",

            "text": "The anisotropic environment of the lipid bilayer constraints the molecular position and orientation, allowing the use of minimalistic thermodynamic models for the structural characterization of peptide/membrane complexes. Based on the Wimley-White double scale of partition free energies, a landscape of positional and orientational states for monomeric peptides in membranes is be calculated, from which we select stability-based probability distributions. For the orientational angles (helix tilt and self-rotation) the distributions are broad and asymmetric, in excellent agreement with available molecular dynamics simulations and with important implications for the correct interpretation of experiments. Such distributions allow a close prediction of the experimental observables for a number of model and natural membrane peptides, whether amphipathic and bond parallel at the membrane interface or inserted across the membrane in a tilted configuration. Moreover, we show that the predicted distributions result from optimizing the position of peptide residues with respect to the hydrophobic, the interface and the bulk-water regions through a complex interplay of displacement along the membrane normal, tilt and rotation. This leads to a re-definition of the hydrophobic matching peptide adaptation, stressing its dynamic character and so far unconsidered roles of the membrane interface and peptide rotation.",
