One interpretation of these findings is that RSV infection in neonates suppresses the development of the Th1 immune response and a Th2 response occurs.

Further, respiratory viral infections lead to a marked expansion of mature DC in the lung [50] . These mature lung DC have a strong capacity to activate both na\u20ac \u0131ve and memory T cells and to induce their proliferation. In a model of influenza infection, maturation of lung DC resulted in strong immunogenicity of an otherwise non-immunogenic antigen [50] . Increases in numbers of lung DC, which arise from local precursors in the lung, outlast the resolution of disease in RSV infection [51] . Importantly, pulmonary DC can stimulate T-cell responses in the lung in situ without migration to the regional lymph nodes, favouring Th2 and Tc2 responses [52] .

Despite the need for anti-viral drugs as an adjunct to vaccines, few are available that are effective. Therefore, novel and new approaches are highly desirable. Recently, Mahalingam and Tindle have demonstrated the efficacy of an hMPV CTL epitope vaccine that triggers a strong Th1 immune response which was associated with accelerated viral clearance in a murine model [75] . In addition, RNA interference (RNAi), a naturally occurring process for controlling gene expression that occurs through a process mediated by short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, has been shown to have the remarkable ability to silence RSV replication both in vitro and in vivo (Tripp et al., unpublished data). These approaches can be used to target host cell genes to silence aspects of the inflammatory pathway that include Th1 or Th2 cytokines, chemokines or proteins that regulate their expression.

(A) During the early stages of a viral infection, antigen presenting cells (APCs: macrophages, DCs) become activated and secrete IL-12. Viral peptide is presented by APCs to na\u20ac \u0131ve T cells in association with MHC class I and co-stimulatory signals (B7 and CD28). The production of IL-12 and the binding of antigen-MHC molecules commit the differentiation of na\u20ac \u0131ve T cells to the Th1 cell subset that secretes Th1 cytokines including IFN-g. The cytokine contributes to the activation of macrophage (make more IL-12), B cells (make IgG2a) and cytotoxic T cell (kill infected cells). An IFN-g dominated microenvironment inhibits the development of a Th2 cell subset. Together, these responses result in the resolution of the infection in the airways. (B) In the early phase of allergen exposure, cross linking of antigen-specific IgE on the surface of mast cells results in the activation and release of mediators that cause bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Activated mast cells also produce IL-4 that commits na\u20ac \u0131ve T cells to the Th2 subset as well as B cell isotype class switching to IgE production. In addition, antigenic peptide is presented to na\u20ac \u0131ve T cells by APCs in the context of MHC class II and co-stimulatory signals. In an IL-4 dominated microenvironment, this triggers the differentiation of na\u20ac \u0131ve T cells to Th2 cell subset that generates Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13). These cytokines are responsible for orchestrating the late phase of the allergic response. IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to mast cell activation and the synthesis of IgE. IL-5 is implicated in eosinophilia and is known to stimulate these cells, resulting in degranulation and release of toxic basic proteins (e.g. ECP, MBP).
