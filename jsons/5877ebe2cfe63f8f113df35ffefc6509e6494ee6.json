            "text": "In this scenario, head and neck cancer (HNC) poses unique challenges in many respects. Patients are frequently frail, and at risk for treatment-related complications. In addition, some COVID-19 signs or symptoms can potentially mimic treatment-related toxicity or tumor recurrence. Furthermore, increasing evidence has emerged that otolaryngologists and head and neck surgeons are at high risk of infection during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures [4] . Certain HNCs (oral cavity cancer, advanced laryngeal cancer, salivary gland carcinoma) are typically managed by surgeons, and there is almost complete lack of level I evidence supporting the use of alternative radiation-based protocols [5] . HNC management requires a highly specialized (web-based) multidisciplinary team aimed to evaluate surgical risks and alternative therapeutic options, balancing the risks related to HNC progression and COVID-19 infection and/or complications [6] . Radiotherapy (RT) plays an essential role in management of HNCs, both in radical and postoperative settings. Therefore, RT departments have to continue their activity, although re-organized, to face the pandemic challenge. Recently, the American Society of Radiation Oncology and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology published recommendations for treatment of HNC, suggesting radical and postoperative RT for involved margins with higher priority compared to adjuvant RT for minor risk factors. Moreover, use of more hypofractionated RT schedules is encouraged (applying concomitant chemotherapy only with conventional or mildly hypofractionatied RT of \u22642.4 Gy/fraction) [7, 8] . Although these recommendations referred specifically to squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aereodigestive tract, it is our opinion that they should be extended even to rare HNC, including adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).",

Indeed, locally advanced diseases, in particular when developing in minor salivary glands of paranasal sinuses, can infiltrate the skull base, either directly or via perineural spread. In these cases, radical resection is extremely challenging, often requiring multi-speciality ablative and reconstructive approach, potentially prolonging surgical time and causing high patient morbidity. Generally, a tumor deemed nonresectable is treated with definitive RT [12] .",

Promising findings have been also confirmed by the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT) in Germany, exploring the combination of Intensity Modulated RT and dose escalated carbon ion boost [22] . Interestingly, a recent study on 227 sinonasal ACC patients showed no significative difference in LC for patients treated postoperatively (R2 in 63% of cases) or definitively after biopsy only (3 year LC rates of 82% and 79%, respectively), with a more favourable late toxicity profile in the latter [23] .",
