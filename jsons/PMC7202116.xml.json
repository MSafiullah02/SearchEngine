            "text": "Following publication of our recent clinical trial of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) in patients without flail chest (1), we wish to offer a consideration during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Ventilators have now become a most precious resource, and strategies to both adapt and conserve them are of the utmost urgency. Within trauma intensive care units, severe chest wall injury is one of the most common reasons for respiratory failure (2), and SSRF is increasingly considered as a management tool (3). Outcomes reported as improved following SSRF have ranged from outpatient quality of life (4) to mortality (5). However, we believe that a particular focus must be placed on ventilator-related outcomes during the current pandemic. Doing so results in two distinct patients: one with present or impending respiratory failure from rib fractures, and the other who, despite pain and splinting, will not require mechanical ventilation. For the former, SSRF will likely conserve ventilators; for the latter, it will consume them unnecessarily.",

In this patient group, the incidence of tracheostomy, as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation, were significantly decreased, as compared to non-operative management. By contrast, in our recent multicenter clinical trial of SSRF in the setting of displaced, non-flail fracture patterns, the incidence of respiratory failure was very low, and not influenced by surgery (1). In this latter group of non-flail patients, SSRF would consume OR resources (including staff, personal protective equipment, and a ventilator) without realizing the aforementioned respiratory benefits.",

The first group will have either impending or present ventilator-dependent respiratory failure due to their rib fractures (most commonly a flail segment), and should be considered for SSRF. Careful attention should be paid to the primary etiology of the patient\u2019s respiratory failure (i.e., pulmonary vs. neurologic). If indicated, SSRF should be performed within 48 hours of injury to maximize the likelihood of ventilator avoidance/liberation (8). The second group, while still demonstrating sequellae of multiple rib fractures, will likely not require intubation from their chest wall injuries. Radiographically, these patients may have displaced fractures without a flail segment. In this situation, the current risk:benefit calculation favors non-operative management with aggressive, multi-modality pain control.",
