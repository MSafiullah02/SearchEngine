            "text": "Transmissible vaccines have the potential to revolutionize infectious disease control by reducing the vaccination effort required to protect a population against a disease. Recent efforts to develop transmissible vaccines focus on recombinant transmissible vaccine designs (RTVs) because they pose reduced risk if intra-host evolution causes the vaccine to revert to its vector form. However, the shared antigenicity of the vaccine and vector may confer vaccine-immunity to hosts infected with the vector, thwarting the ability of the vaccine to spread through the population. We build a mathematical model to test whether a RTV can facilitate disease management in instances where reversion is likely to introduce the vector into the population or when the vector organism is already established in the host population, and the vector and vaccine share perfect crossimmunity. Our results show that a RTV can autonomously eradicate a pathogen, or protect a population from pathogen invasion, when cross-immunity between vaccine and vector is absent. If cross-immunity between vaccine and vector exists, however, our results show that a RTV can substantially reduce the vaccination effort necessary to control or eradicate a pathogen only when continuously augmented with direct manual vaccination. These results demonstrate that estimating the extent of cross-immunity between vector and vaccine is a critical step in RTV design, and that herpesvirus vectors showing facile reinfection and weak cross-immunity are promising.",

In many cases, however, the full potential of vaccination cannot be realized because it is difficult or impossible to vaccinate a substantial proportion of the host population. Particularly challenging scenarios for efficient vaccine delivery include human diseases in regions with poorly developed public health infrastructure and diseases of wild animal populations. An important consequence of the challenges associated with vaccinating large proportions of wild animal populations is that we may be missing opportunities to eliminate or reduce reservoir populations of diseases that occasionally spill over into human populations (e.g., Ebola, Rabies; [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] ), or that provide the raw material for full scale host shifts into the human population (e.g., SARS; [6] ). This problem is particularly pressing in light of evidence suggesting that the incidence of such host-shifts is increasing due to the greater prevalence of humans in regions with high levels of wildlife diversity [7] . One promising new technology for dealing with the challenges associated with these difficult-toimmunize animal populations is the development of transmissible vaccines.",

One way in which a transmissible vaccine can be developed is through the process of attenuation [8] . Although attenuation can be accomplished in many ways, the goal in all cases is the transformation of the original viral disease into a benign yet transmissible vaccine. This approach has been used to develop transmissible vaccines both unintentionally, as with the oral polio vaccine [8, 9] , and intentionally, as with myxoma virus in rabbits [10] [11] [12] . However, there are limitations and risks associated with transmissible vaccines produced through attenuation. For instance, because attenuated vaccines are built from the pathogen itself, the ability of the vaccine to spread between hosts is bounded by the transmissibility of the pathogen. More worrisome is the possibility of reversion to wild type virulence, as has been observed in the oral polio vaccine [9, 13, 14] . For this reason, and the constraints imposed by the process of attenuation itself, transmissible vaccines developed through attenuation will generally be only weakly transmissible. Despite these limitations, recent theoretical work has demonstrated that weakly transmissible attenuated vaccines could be highly effective tools, particularly against infectious diseases with relatively low transmission rates [15] .",

Specifically, rather than weakening the pathogen itself through a process of attenuation, recombinant transmissible vaccines (RTVs), also called transmissible recombinant vectored vaccines [16] , are developed by inserting one or more pathogen genes with antigenic activity into the genome of a benign but transmissible vector organism. Infection with the modified vector, now termed the vaccine, exposes the host immune system to pathogen antigens and prompts a pathogen-specific immune response (Fig. 1) . This approach has been used to develop a transmissible vaccine against Sin Nombre Virus within deer mice [17] , and is now being used to develop a transmissible vaccine against Ebola within mice and nonhuman primate models [18, 19] .",

            "text": "In principle, RTVs offer several advantages over vaccines produced by attenuation. For instance, evolutionary reversion in a RTV is likely to produce the benign vector organism rather than the virulent pathogen itself. Also, because the transmission rate of the vaccine is related to the transmission rate of the vector rather than the pathogen, there are fewer limitations on the vaccine transmission rate. However, because a RTV necessarily integrates components of both disease and vector, it may struggle to spread through a host population where substantial cross-immunity to either the disease or vector already exists [20, 21] . This reduction in effectiveness is important in cases where the vector organism is already present in the population, or where vaccine-reversion produces free vector. For these reasons, it is currently unclear whether RTVs that generate cross-immunity can serve as effective tools in the battle against infectious disease.",

Our goal is to establish bounds on the role of cross-immunity in hindering the effectiveness of a RTV. We begin by evaluating the ability of a RTV to facilitate pathogen control when the vector is absent from the host population. This first scenario also applies to the extreme case for which cross-immunity with the vector is absent. We compare this baseline case to the other extreme case where cross-immunity is perfect and the vector is circulating in the population or likely to be introduced through sporadic reversion. We direct part of our analysis towards current RTV designs which envision a vaccine that, when administered to a small number of 'founder' animals in a population, will spread autonomously and sufficiently to vaccinate the remaining population. We use a mathematical model to address the following specific questions: (1) can a RTV autonomously eradicate and/or protect a population that has previously experienced vector infection? and (2) if autonomous vaccination by a RTV is impossible, can augmenting the vaccine with direct, manual vaccinations make a RTV an effective tool for the control of infectious disease? Our results indicate that supplementation of a RTV through direct vaccination is critical for disease control if reversion to the vector form is likely and vector-vaccine cross-immunity is present. Our results identify key criteria that must be satisfied for a RTV to be an effective tool in infectious disease management, and outline quantities that must be estimated during the process of vaccine development to evaluate these criteria.",

Specifically, if vaccine-infected individuals transmit the vaccine to more than one additional unvaccinated individual (R 0,v > 1), and the vaccine's R 0 is larger than the pathogen's (R 0,v > R 0,w ), then a host population is cleared of an endemic pathogen and/or protected from future infection (SI, Section 2).",

This occurs regardless of the initial number of vaccinated individuals, and is a direct consequence of the cross-immunity between the vector and vaccine, and the vaccine's reduced rate of transmission relative to the vector (R 0,v < R 0,c , Fig. 1 ). The reduction in transmission of the vaccine relative to its vector renders the vaccine unable to repel the spread of its associated vector should reversion occur, while perfect cross-immunity ensures that the vector will drive the vaccine to extinction by imparting vaccine-immunity to a substantial portion of the population. These results suggest that the viability of autonomous vaccination depends critically on the degree of crossimmunity between the vector and vaccine. In light of this result, we next investigate the extent to which vaccine transmission, when coupled with a steady program of direct vaccination, can facilitate pathogen control even when the vaccine and vector share perfect cross-immunity.",

However, the predictions of such multi-strain models are highly sensitive to assumptions made regarding the presence of strain competition within a co-infected host, the rate of strain re-infection, as well as the level of cross-immunity between strains [28] . Once estimates of these specific parameters are found, our theory allows the potential advantage provided by vaccine transmission to be quantified. Because RTV's carry with them the risks associated with the release of any genetically modified organism [29, 30] , their use should only be entertained in cases where the advantages can be quantified and demonstrated to be substantial relative to a traditional, directly administered vaccine.",
