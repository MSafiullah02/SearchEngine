            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) is one of the major control mechanisms of gene expression in various metazoan viruses including retroviruses and also occurs more rarely in cellular genes of eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Farabaugh, 1996; Namy et al., 2004; Jacobs et al., 2007). During translation elongation, ribosomes change reading frame in a +1 or \u22121 direction relative to the start codon, resulting in the translation of a protein encoded in two reading frames in the mRNA. As the result of PRF, gag and pol proteins are synthesized at specific ratios in retroviruses and retroviral\u2010like elements (Jacks et al., 1988; Farabaugh, 1996; Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006). Even small changes in the PRF frequency results in the unbalanced production of gag and pol polypeptides, leading to the formation of non\u2010infective retroviral particles (Shehu\u2010Xhilaga et al., 2001). Hence strategies dealing with mutations that alter PRF rates in retroviruses have important clinical applications in the prevention of retroviral propagation (Dinman et al., 1997, 1998; Gareiss and Miller, 2009; Park et al., 2009).",

In viruses such as the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV\u20101) and the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), PRF occurs within the gag\u2010pol junction with a shift in the \u22121 direction on the mRNA. Efficient \u22121 PRF requires a heptameric slippery sequence and is stimulated by a downstream pseudoknot structure that causes pausing of the ribosome at the slippery heptamer (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Giedroc and Cornish, 2009; Plant and Dinman, 2008). +1 frameshifting also occurs at a heptameric frameshift site and its efficiency depends on the structure and abundance of tRNAs that decode the codons at the frameshift site (Farabaugh, 1996).",

            "text": "Ty3 is a retrovirus\u2010like element in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Clark et al., 1988; Hansen et al., 1988). It was classified in the Metaviridae group of the Retrovirales order due to structural and genetic similarities to animal retroviruses (Capy, 2005). In addition to structural similarities, Irwin et al. (2005) showed that Ty3 and animal retroviruses require similar sets of host genes for their cellular propagation. The Ty3 genome encodes two overlapping peptides, Gag3 and Pol3, which are functionally similar to the retroviral gag and pol polypeptides, respectively (Farabaugh, 1995). Peptides derived from Gag3, after proteolytic cleavage, function as viral nucleocapsid proteins for the formation of Ty3 virus\u2010like particles in the yeast cells. Proteolytic processing of Pol3 yields three enzymatic activities required for Ty3 transposition: protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase/RNaseH (Farabaugh, 1995; Kim et al., 1998). Translation of the Pol3 polypeptide requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift in the +1 direction by out\u2010of\u2010frame binding of a valyl\u2010tRNA at a GUU codon of the frameshift site (Farabaugh et al., 1993; Vimaladithan and Farabaugh, 1994).",

            "text": "Some cellular factors required for propagation of Ty3 element may regulate the efficiency of PRF. Because PRF occurs during the elongation stage of translation, it may be regulated by signalling pathways that target translation elongation factors (EF) or by ribosomal proteins. EF\u2010kinases, which are activated by a glucose pulse, are known to control the translation elongation process by acting on EF2 in human cells (Horman et al., 2002; Yan et al., 2003). Mutations in cellular genes such as ribosomal proteins and tRNAs, can perturb the PRF frequency in both bacteria and yeast (Atkins and Bj\u00f6rk, 2009). The function of these frameshift regulating factors may be controlled physiologically. For example, Stahl et al. (2004) also reported that the PRF frequency changes in Ty1 in a growth stage\u2010dependent manner in yeast; the growth stage effect may also function through frameshift\u2010regulating signalling pathways. In addition, we reported that the Ty1 type +1 PRF frequency decreases several fold in gycerol\u2013lactate\u2010grown S. cerevisiae cells (T\u00fcrkel et al., 2009); this carbon source regulation may function through one or more signalling pathways.",

High levels of glucose in the growth medium repress the genes required for the utilization of alternative carbon sources like glycerol, lactate, sucrose and galactose (Gancedo, 1998). Addition of glucose to yeast cultures growing in non\u2010fermentable carbon sources changes the expression patterns of approximately 30% of the S. cerevisiae genes (DeRisi et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2004). The cell membrane of S. cerevisiae contains low\u2010affinity glucose sensors Gpr1p and Rgt2p and the high\u2010affinity sensor Snf3p (Schneper et al., 2004; Santangelo, 2006). Activation of these glucose sensors leads to the transduction of the glucose signal to various cytoplasmic protein kinases, principally Snf1p, cAMP\u2010dependent protein kinase\u2010A (PKA), and TOR kinases in S. cerevisiae (Busti et al., 2010). Downstream targets of these protein kinases include transcriptional regulators, metabolic enzymes and structural proteins (Santangelo, 2006; Zaman et al., 2008; Busti et al., 2010). Snf1p and cAMP\u2010dependent PKA are especially important for the glucose response and are conserved throughout eukaryotes (Hong and Carlson, 2007; Smets et al., 2010).",

Snf1p becomes activated after autophosphorylation of its T210 residue in response to glucose limitation and certain stress conditions (Hong and Carlson, 2007; Hedbacker and Carlson 2008). However, the specific metabolites or signals that trigger the Snf1p activation are still unknown (Hedbacker and Carlson, 2008; Busti et al., 2010). The Snf1p complex can be found in various subcellular compartments depending on growth conditions. Snf1p localization depends on its association with three alternative \u03b2\u2010subunits: Sip1p, Sip2p and Gal83p (Hedbacker et al., 2004; Vincent et al., 2001). The Snf1p\u2010Sip2p complex remains in the cytoplasm when cells are grown either on glucose or alternative carbon sources. Growing yeast cells in alternative carbon sources causes Gal83 to displace Sip2p and the resulting Snf1p\u2010Gal83p kinase complex translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Moreover, in ethanol\u2010grown yeast cells Sip1p replaces Sip2p and the Snf1p\u2010Sip1p complex translocates from the cytoplasm to the vacuole. The nucleocytoplasmic distributions of active Snf1 complexes provide versatility to the physiological response and adaptation to alternative carbon sources.",

In the Ty3\u2010FS vector, the Ty3 frameshift site (GCG\u2010AGT\u2010T) is fused to the E. coli lacZ gene in the +1 reading frame. Therefore, the amount of translation of the lacZ fusion protein in this expression vector depends on the efficiency of the +1 frameshift event in the +1 direction at the Ty3 frameshift site. In the Ty3\u2010FF plasmid, the central nucleotide A of the frameshift site has been removed, putting the lacZ reporter gene into the zero reading frame. In this reporter vector, translation of the lacZ fusion protein does not require a frameshift (Farabaugh et al., 1993). Plasmid pLG\u2010\u0394312 is also a 2 \u00b5m\u2010URA3\u2010based shuttle vector, which contains a CYC1\u2010lacZ gene fusion (Guarente, 1983). It was used as the control gene fusion because the transcription of CYC1 is regulated by glucose signalling (Zitomer et al., 1979). Plasmids were transformed into competent yeast cells as described previously using the lithium accetate\u2010PEG method (Gietz and Schiestl, 1995).

The protein kinases Snf1p and cAMP\u2010PKA are known to be the major factors regulating diverse metabolic events by carbon sources in S. cerevisiae. Having shown that glucose signalling regulates the PRF frequency in Ty3, we tested whether Snf1p and PKA were involved in the regulation of the Ty3 frameshift frequency. First, we used mutant strains in which PKA or Snf1p is constitutively active. Reg1p is the negative regulator of Snf1p kinase responsible for reduced activity in glucose\u2010grown cells. In a reg1\u2206 mutant, Snf1p activity is constitutively high (Ludin et al., 1998) and we found that Ty3 PRF in a reg1\u2206 mutant was nearly 2\u2010fold higher than in wild\u2010type yeast grown in glucose medium (Table 3). The high\u2010affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase Pde2p is a negative regulator of PKA activity; the increased levels of cytoplasmic cAMP in a pde2\u2206 mutant cause elevated PKA activity (Park et al., 2005) and we found that Ty3 PRF in a pde2\u2206 mutant was nearly 2\u2010fold higher than wild type (Table 3). By contrast, a pde1\u2206 mutant lacking low\u2010affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase Pde1p has no effect on the cytoplasmic cAMP levels (Park et al., 2005) and we found that Ty3 PRF is unchanged from wild type (Table 3). As expected, expression of the control CYC1\u2010lacZ gene fusion was increased relative to wild type more than 3\u2010fold in the reg1\u2206 mutant strain grown in glucose, demonstrating that Snf1p is constitutively active in this mutant yeast strain. In addition, pde1\u2206 and pde2\u2206 caused no significant change in expression of the CYC1\u2010lacZ reporter.",

Furthermore, in cells grown in ethanol, which causes sequestration of Snf1p in the vacuole, Ty3 PRF frequency decreased 3\u2010fold. These results suggest that cytoplasmic Snf1 kinase may be necessary for stimulation of PRF in Ty3 in response to alternative carbon sources. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of snf1\u2206 and sip2\u2206 deletions on PRF efficiency. Sip2p, one of the \u03b2\u2010subunits of Snf1p, promotes cytoplasmic localization and stimulates the kinase activity of Snf1p (Vincent et al., 2001). snf1\u2206 and sip2\u2206 mutants are each viable; although sip2\u2206 cells grow in alternative carbon sources, snf1\u2206 cells do not. To test the effect of Snf1p on Ty3 PRF, snf1\u2206 or sip2\u2206 mutant yeast strain was grown in glucose medium to logarithmic stage and then shifted to glycerol\u2013lactate medium for 8 h. In wild\u2010type cells, this nutritional shift resulted in a 1.8\u2010fold increase in PRF (Table 2), but in snf1\u2206 or sip2\u2206 mutant cells there was no increase in the frameshift frequency when these strains were grown in glycerol and lactate medium (Table 4). However, when the sip2\u2206 mutant yeast strain was grown in ethanol medium, frameshift frequency decreased to 1.8%, as in the wild\u2010type strain. Ethanol\u2010induced localization of the Snf1p kinase to the vacuole, which occurs both in the wild\u2010type strain or a sip2\u2206 strain, should reduce cytoplasmic Snf1 activity and also reduces Ty3 PRF, consistent with our hypothesis (Table 4). The results obtained from reg1\u2206, snf1\u2206 and sip2\u2206 mutants strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic Snf1p\u2010Sip2p complex stimulates Ty3 PRF in response to alternative carbon sources (Table 4).",

In addition, increase in the Ty3 PRF frequency upon addition of glucose to ethanol\u2010grown yeast cells further supports the idea that activation of PKA and inactivation of Snf1p complex upon glucose addition regulates the PRF frequency in Ty3. Alternatively, it was possible that increased cAMP might regulate Ty3 PRF by a pathway not involving PKA. To test the role of cAMP\u2010dependent PKA in the activation of Ty3 frameshift, we quantified Ty3 PRF in a strain lacking the three PKA structural genes, tpk1\u2206, tpk2\u2206, and tpk3\u2206. Because PKA is essential, the triple deletion mutant is inviable; viability can be restored by deletion of the YAK1 gene, a non\u2010essential gene encoding another kinase involved in the glucose response. This mutant was derived from the S. cerevisiae strain \u03a31278b background, which has an intrinsically high level of cAMP and hence very high levels of PKA activity (Stanhill et al., 1999). This higher level may explain why the PRF frequency (14%) for the \u03a31278b strain grown in glucose is 3.1\u2010fold higher than in the S288c\u2010based BY4741 series of wild\u2010type yeast strains used in other experiments (Table 5).

Transcription of CYC1 is regulated by three distinct mechanisms. These are glucose repression, respiration status of the yeast cells and haem metabolism (H\u00f6rtner et al., 1982). The major transcriptional activators of CYC1 are the Hap activator complex (Hap2/3/4/5) and Hap1p. Genome\u2010wide analysis of \u03a31278b strain showed that many transcription factors (such as Hap4p, Snf11p, Spt6p) and CYC1 itself are overexpressed in this strain (Jin et al., 2008).

However, the effects of different signal transduction pathways on the PRF frequency have not been elucidated yet. In this study we have shown that glucose\u2010signalling regulates the PRF frequency in Ty3 in S. cerevisiae. Growth on several alternative carbon sources resulted in significant changes in PRF, consistent with the concept that PRF is regulated by one or more glucose\u2010dependent signalling systems. We provide genetic evidence indicating that activation of the protein kinases Snf1p and PKA controls the PRF frequency in Ty3. We also demonstrated that the ribosome\u2010associated Stm1 protein is necessary for stimulation of Ty3 PRF by alternative carbon sources.

We believe that the Snf1p kinase directly acts on the translation elongation complex in the cytoplasm. Our results clearly show that stimulation of PRF by Snf1p in alternative carbon sources requires the Sip2 protein. Snf1p is the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins that forms complexes with a single gamma subunit, Snf4p, and three alternative beta subunits, Sip1p, Sip2p and Gal83p. All three Snf1p complexes localize to the cytoplasm during growth on glucose as carbon source. During growth on alternative carbon sources two of the complexes shift to new cellular locations. Gal83p\u2010associated Snf1p shifts to the nucleus in alternative carbon sources and mediates its transcriptional effect (Vincent et al., 2001). Although overexpression of Sip1p can complement the transcriptional defect of a gal83\u2206 mutant (Mylin et al., 1994), Sip1p\u2010associated Snf1p is not normally nuclear but instead after a shift to ethanol medium it localizes to the vacuole (Vincent et al., 2001); the purpose of this localization is unclear. A significant decrease in the PRF frequency in ethanol\u2010grown yeast cells further supports the involvement of cytoplasmic Snf1p in the regulation of PRF in Ty3. The Snf1p\u2010Sip2p complex remains cytoplasmically localized in all carbon sources. We have demonstrated that, on alternative carbon sources, transcription of CYC1 is derepressed to nearly wild\u2010type levels in \u0394sip2 mutant, indicating that Sip2p\u2010associated Snf1p is not required for the nuclear functions of Snf1p.

Translation is reduced up to 95% in as little as 5 min following removal of glucose (Ashe et al., 2000) and is associated with mRNAs accumulating in P bodies (Ashe et al., 2000; Teixeira et al., 2005). This repression does not occur after withdrawal of alternative carbon sources like galactose or sucrose. Moreover, repression and P body association of mRNAs during glucose withdrawal do not occur in cells lacking Reg1p, PKA or Stm1p protein (Balagopal and Parker, 2009). Balagopal and Parker (2009) argue that the role of Stm1p in this response is, as a ribosome\u2010bound protein, to promote ribosomal stalling by blocking translation elongation at some specific step of the elongation cycle. Recently, they showed that Stm1p inhibits in vitro translation by blocking elongation by 80S ribosomes (Balagopal and Parker, 2011). However, glucose removal induces transient repression, lasting about 2 h after cells are transferred from glucose to an alternative carbon source (Ashe et al., 2000) whereas the Ty3 PRF effect is a long\u2010term response to glucose withdrawal after the cells have adapted to growth on the alternative carbon source. It is conceivable that Stm1 has different functional roles in the transient and long\u2010term response to the carbon source shift.",

            "text": "It is known that the frameshift efficiency and the synthesis of pol polypeptides are directly proportional to the formation of viral particles in retroviruses and retroviral\u2010like elements (Menees and Sandmeyer, 1996; Shehu\u2010Xhilaga et al., 2001; Gareiss and Miller, 2009). Menees and Sandmeyer (1996) also found that Ty3 transposition decreases dramatically in certain growth conditions such as high temperature and growth in ethanol and that, although the transcription of Ty3 mRNA is not affected, the synthesis of Pol3 polypeptides (integrase and reverse transcriptase) is undetectable in these conditions. Our demonstration that Ty3 PRF is drastically reduced when cells are transferred to ethanol suggests that this effect may be the cause of the decline in Pol3 expression and in Ty3 transposition. More generally, the response of PRF to changes in cellular physiology suggests that programmed frameshifting may be used as a sensor of the state of the host cell by retrotransposons in yeast and by extension by retroviruses and other metazoan viruses. Hence manipulation of signal transduction pathways that influence PRF could cause imbalances in Gag/Pol ratio and therefore interfere with viral propagation. Such signal transduction systems may provide targets for development of alternative strategies to interfere with propagation of retroviruses and retroviral\u2010like elements.",
