Clinical and pathological review of 53 cases suggested that accumulation of secretions rather than infection was responsible; histologically, inflammatory cells without bacteria were present in the alveoli. The authors presented a case in which bronchoscopic resection of an endobronchial lesion eliminated the obstruction and resulted in resolution of the pulmonary infiltrate as well as the patient's cough and sputum production. These authors stated that, while generally not infectious, the pneumonitis occasionally progressed to bacterial lung abscess. Nearly all of their cases were accrued in the preantibiotic era, so bacterial infection, had it been responsible, would likely have progressed and become easily recognizable. In a later histopathologic study of 50 patients with obstructive pneumonitis, Burke and Fraser [7] reported that the infiltrate was not due to bacteria in 42 cases (84%). These investigators concluded that an opacification distal to an obstructing tumor is caused by retained epithelial secretions, although, in some proportion of cases, secondary infection may occur. The term \"postobstructive pneumonia\" began to replace \"obstructive pneumonitis\" in the 1970s [18] . In more recent studies [8, 9] , ultrasound-guided aspiration of a cavity associated with a lung cancer yielded bacteria (generally mouth flora) in one-third of cases, but it is important to note that the aspiration was from a cavity, not from an infiltrate. Discordance between organisms identified by aspiration and those identified by sputum culture [8, 9, 19, 20] has led many investigators rightfully to question the value of sputum culture in PO-CAP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 24, "end": 27, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1006, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1374, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1403, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1406, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1732, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1735, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1739, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1743, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 172, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study systematically applied newly available techniques to search for a microbial cause, including PCR for viruses and enzyme immunoassay for detection of bacterial antigens in urine and PCT levels in serum. Several findings argue against a bacterial cause for most cases of PO-CAP. First, despite substantial overlap, the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in PO-CAP differ from those in B-CAP. PO-CAP is a more chronic condition with a substantially longer median duration of symptoms and a greater proportion with weight loss. Findings that are usually associated with a bacterial infection, such as a preceding upper respiratory infection, hyperacute presentation, fever, leukocytosis, leukopenia, or increased band forms [5] , are less prevalent in PO-CAP. All patients in our study received antibiotics, but fever was more likely to persist in patients with PO-CAP. Second, ours is the first systematic study of PCT levels in patients with PO-CAP. Despite problems with sensitivity and specificity [5, 21] , this test has been widely recommended to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial infections [22] [23] [24] [25] . In nearly two-thirds of PO-CAP cases, PCT was \u22640.25 ng/mL, which is thought to oppose the diagnosis of bacterial infection, and in 33% PCT was \u22640.1 ng/mL. Third, despite an intensive and systematic search for bacterial infection, only 3 (10%) PO-CAP patients had evidence of bacterial infection. No previous study has examined the role of viruses in PO-CAP. A respiratory virus was identified by PCR in 16.7% of patients with PO-CAP, similar to 18.4% in those without obstruction.

Data were collected at a single institution that treats predominately male patients; in addition, despite an intense search for an infectious cause, the possibility remains that patients in whom a bacterial etiology was not identified still had a bacterial infection.

Patients with PO-CAP have greater chronicity of disease, manifested by a longer duration of symptoms, greater weight loss, absence of symptoms of upper respiratory infection, lower WBC counts with fewer band forms, and higher platelet counts. They are less likely to have sputum production but more likely to have hemoptysis, fever, and a cavitary lesion on chest radiograph. Serum PCT at admission is lower than in bacterial pneumonia. PO-CAP patients defervesce more slowly in the hospital and have substantially higher 30-day mortality. Overlap with B-CAP, however, limits the possibility of making a clinical distinction at the time of admission in an individual case. Given the strong evidence against a role for bacterial pathogens, results of the present study should encourage more limited antibiotic use in patients with PO-CAP. Our experience has been that when patients fail to respond to a first course of antibiotics, physicians repeat sputum cultures, which now are contaminated with newly acquired gram-negative colonizing organisms, and then give additional antibiotics to \"cover\" these newly recognized bacteria. The results of our study strongly oppose this kind of medical management. If a patient fails to defervesce with a first course of antibiotics, full attention should be focused on treating the obstructing lesion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Financial support.
