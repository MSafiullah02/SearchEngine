            "text": "Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders including spongiform encephalopathies in cattle and sheeps and Creutzfeld-Jacob syndrome in humans. Although biological functioning of prion protein (PrP) is still unknown it seems to be generally accepted that it may play a critical role in copper homeostasis and copper based enzymatic activity. 1 Mammalian protein possesses two specific binding sites in the unstructured domain: i) octarepeat region 2 and ii) neurotoxic peptide fragment. 3 In all cases histidine residues play a basic role in the metal protein interactions. Avian proteins contain the hexapeptide repeats having also one His residue critical for Cu(II) binding. 4 Surprisingly the fish proteins e.g. that of Japanese pufferfish may be even more potent Cu(II) binder than those of mammalians and avian. 5 In the latter case the repeat domain is very different than those in human or chicken, but containing multihistidine region is very effective in the interactions with copper. The ability to control the coordination properties of metals (number of ligands, geometry, etc.) in proteins is an essential feature for the design of metalloenzymes. We will discuss the factors that allow us to differentiate the relative binding affinities of the same metal for apparently identical sites within moderately long peptides and discriminate between different metals for chemically identical sites. Using the designed -helical 3-stranded coiled coil peptides known as the TRI peptides (sequence G-(LKALEEK) 4 G in which one or two of the leucines (L) is substituted by cysteine (C)) we will describe the protein chemistry of toxic heavy metals such as Pb(II), As(III), Hg(II) and Cd(II) with thiolate rich protein sequences. We will show that Cd(II) can be controlled to bind as either a three or four coordinate structure in aqueous solution and we will show that individual peptides can be made that contain two 4-coordinate, two 3-coordinate or a mixed 3 and 4 coordinate peptides. We will also discuss site selective metal binding where Cd(II) can be forced to one site in this protein to the exclusion of a second identical binding site and when simultaneously challenged with both Pb(II) and Cd(II), one can selectively sequester metals into binding sites that again appear identical. This selectivity will be discussed using crystallographic studies of an As(III) peptide.",

            "text": "The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) forms the active site of all molybdenum enzymes, except nitrogenase. Molybdenum enzymes catalyze important redox reactions in global metabolic cycles. Moco consists of molybdenum covalently bound to one or two dithiolates attached to a unique tricyclic pterin moiety commonly referred to as molybdopterin (MPT). Moco is synthesized by an ancient and conserved biosynthetic pathway that can be divided into four major steps, according to the biosynthetic intermediates precursor Z (cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate), MPT, and adenylated MPT. Before molybdenum is inserted, a Cu(I) atom is bound via the MPT dithiolene sulfurs. In a fifth step modifications such as attachment of nucleotides, sulfuration, or bond formation between Molybdenum and the protein result in different catalytic centers formed by Moco. Upon completion of cofactor biosynthesis Moco can be bound to a carrier protein. A defect in any of the steps of Moco biosynthesis results in the pleiotropic loss of all molybdenum enzyme activities, causing the death of the organism. Human Moco deficiency is a hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by severe neurodegeneration resulting in early childhood death. Latest developments in the field of bacterial and eukarytic Moco biosynthesis will be presented. Finally, novel insights into the biosynthesis of related tungsten-containing pterin cofactors will be discussed.",

            "text": "Myoglobin (Mb) is a small (17 kDa), well characterized heme protein that is often used as a model system for other heme proteins and the reactions they catalyze. Very recently, we have designed a myoglobin mutant, F43W/H64D Mb, in which an aromatic substrate locates immediate above the heme as a model for a substrate bound form of cytochrome P450 and site specific aromatic hydroxylation was found to proceed by a stochiometric amount of H 2 O 2 in a few seconds. As an extension of our efforts for the construction of organometalloproteins, we have replaced the heme prosthetic group with a series of M(salophen) complexes. We have also applied this strategy to heme oxygenase (HO) which is known to catalyze the conversion of heme to biliverdin. In this particular case, we have introduced Fe III (Schiff-base) bearing a carboxylate group, instead of heme, located at the active site of HO. The crystal structure of an Fe(carboxylate-Schiff-base)/HO composite shows a hydrogen bond between propionic acid and Arg177 of HO. Due to the hydrogen bonding formation, the ET rate from NADPH/CPR to the composite is 3.5-fold faster than that of Fe(Schiff-base)/HO, though a redox potential of Fe(carboxylate-Schiff-base)/HO (-79 mV vs. NHE) is lower than that of Fe(Schiff-base)/HO (+15 mV vs. NHE). Instead of these small protein cavities, we have also employed a protein having a large cavity, i.e., ferritin (Fr). We have prepared a zero-valent palladium cluster by chemical reduction of palladium ions in the apo-ferritin cage and examined its catalytic reduction activity.",

            "text": "New fluorescent probes for Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Metallothioneins (MTs) are a class of small, cysteine-rich proteins ubiquitous all across the different kingdoms of life. Characteristic is also the pronounced affinity for metal ions with d 10 configuration, which are bound in form of metal-thiolate clusters using the deprotonated thiolate groups of the cysteine residues as ligands. Although the discovery of the first plant metallothionein reaches back more than 20 years, their characterization was paid little attention. This is even more surprising considering that the amino acid sequences and cysteine distribution patterns of plant MTs differ distinctively from the isoforms of other organisms. Plant MTs are sub-grouped into four families, whose members show a tremendously broader sequence variety than those of the mammalian subfamilies. Most striking are perhaps the differences in cysteine content ranging from 10-17 residues per protein, or 15-20% of total amino acids. The reason why plants display such sequence diversity is largely unknown so far. A spectroscopic investigation of the most peculiar metal ion binding abilities of a number of plant metallothioneins will be presented, also considering the redox state of the environment. In addition, I will elaborate shortly on our possibly most peculiar finding so far, the existence of a two-metal ion cluster, called the -domain, which was unreported of in the MT superfamily so far [1] . Financial support for this project comes from the Swiss National Science Foundation (200020-113728/1 to EF). The Na+ -translocating NADH dehydrogenase (Na+ -NQR) is a multisubunit respiratory complex containing one 2Fe-2S cluster and several flavins that couples the oxidation of NADH to the transport of Na+ across the inner bacterial membrane. The enzyme from Vibrio cholerae contributes to extracellular superoxide production which might augment the pathogenicity of the bacterium in the human host (Lin et al, 2007) . In our effort to assign electron transfer reactions to individual cofactors in the complex, we studied the redox properties of the individual NqrF subunit which contains one FAD and one [2Fe-2S] cluster. The FAD in subunit NqrF represents the flavin cofactor with the most negative midpoint potential in the Na+-NQR, according to its function as hydride acceptor from NADH and electron entry site into the complex. From there, electrons are transferred to the FeS cluster in subunit NqrF which represents the first example for a vertebrate-type [2Fe-2S] cluster in a respiratory complex (Lin et al., 2005) . The Na+ -NQR complex was overproduced in Vibrio cholerae and purified by affinity chromatography. Electron microscopic analysis of the Na+ -NQR complex stained with uranyl formate revealed particles with a larger elongated domain (11 x 6 mm) and a smaller globular protrusion with a diameter of 3-4 nm. Lin, P.-C., Puhar, A., T\u00fcrk, K., Piligkos, S., Bill, E., Neese, F., Molybdenum and tungsten are the only 4d (Mo) and 5d (W) transition metals that are required for the normal metabolism of biological systems. Mo enzymes are present in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans; their W counterparts occur less frequently. Virtually all the reactions catalysed by these enzymes involve the net transfer of an oxygen atom either to or from the substrate. The structures of several Mo-and W-enzymes have been determined by protein crystallography; in each case the metal is bound to the dithiolene group of one (or two) \"molybdopterin\" (MPT) cofactor(s). We have shown that Rhodobacter capsulatus DMSO reductase is active with either Mo or W as the catalytic centre. This W-DMSO reductase is the only isoenzyme for which structural, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and kinetic characterisation have been achieved thus allowing for direct comparisons with its Mo counterpart. In respect of catalytic activity, W-DMSOR >> Mo-DMSOR for the reduction of DMSO to DMS; however, unlike Mo-DMSOR, W-DMSOR shows (virtually) no ability to catalyse the oxidation of DMS to DMSO. Reasons for the significantly different activity of these equivalent Mo and W centres will be presented. The role of D145, a conserved active site residue of Rhodobacter sphaeroides DMSO reductase has been examined.The structure of the MPT is remarkably conserved in the Mo and W enzymes, but one crystallographic study has shown that the pyran ring can be closed or open. Possible roles for MPT in the catalysis accomplished by the Mo and W enzymes will be discussed.",

The Cu 2+ derivatives of thermolysin and carboxypeptidse A do not have enzyme activities. As reported previously (2) , the Cu 2+ derivative of DPP III has the high enzyme activity and we showed that the motif part of DPP III directly influences the expression of the enzyme activity in the copper derivative of DPP III. For Arg-Argnaphthylamide, the value of kcat/Km of Cu(II)-DPP III was 1/3 that of Zn(II)-DPP III. Lys-Ala-naphthylamide was also the good substrate for Cu(II)-DPP III but slowly digested at low temperature by Cu(II)-DPP III. The EPR spectra of Cu(II)-DPP III mixed with substrate(1-10 mM), Lys-Ala-naphthylamide, at low temperature and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen were measured and were different from that of Cu(II)-DPP III. The EPR spectra of the substrate-Cu(II)-DPP III complexes gradually change to original EPR spectrum of Cu(II)-DPP III when the substrate-Cu(II)-DPP III complexes were incubated at 10 o C. These results clearly indicated that the substrate-Cu(II)-DPP III complex could be measured as EPR spectrum. ",

Contact e-mail: hirota@ms.naist.jp Hemocyanins (Hcs) are cooperative oxygen carrier and storage proteins in molluscs and arthropods. In the latter, Hc is an oligomeric protein with a minimal functional subunit of 75 kDa designated as 5S. The subunits in Carcinus aestuarii Hc are arranged both as hexamers (16S, 10%) and dodecamers (24S, 90%) in the presence of 20 mM Ca 2+ at pH 7.5. The O 2 binding properties of Hc show strong pH-dependence (Bohr effect). The structures of oxy and deoxygenated Limulus polyphemus Hc have been shown to be different from the structure of Panulirus interruptus deoxyhemocyanin (deoxyHc) by X-ray crystallographic studies, and the former structures have been proposed to correspond to the low affinity (T state) form, whereas the latter structure to the high affinity (R state) form. Although type 3 copper proteins, in particular Hc, have been studied extensively in the bioinorganic field because of the unique reversible O 2 binding at the dicopper center, information on the O 2 -binding character of these proteins is limited. We have recently shown that O 2 dissociates from monomeric oxytyrosinase by 355-nm pulse irradiation and rebinds to the produced deoxytyrosinase [1] . In this study, we investigated the O 2 binding kinetics of Hc by flash photolysis and found the O 2binding properties related to both the Bohr effect and cooperativity. ",

Contact e-mail: zxhuang@fudan.edu.cn Various classes of natural hemoproteins perform a wide variety of biological activities, such as oxygen carrier, electron transfer, biochemical reaction catalyses, and signal transduction, although they share the same protoheme IX as prosthetic group. The artificial design of metalloproteins with desired or novel properties and reactivity is one of the challenges in chemical biology research. Hemoproteins are the excellent natural models and starting-molecules. In order further to convert an electron transfer hemoprotein into a catalytic metalloprotein molecular design based on cytochrome c has been employed. Compared to the heme active site of peroxidases a series single-, double-and triple-site mutant proteins of yeast iso-1cytochrome c were generated to eliminate the axial ligand and to introduce a distal histidine and arginine in the heme pocket at residue position Met80, Tyr67, Pro71. The obtained three variants, M80V, Y67H, and Y67H/M80V showed much higher peroxidase activity than the wild-type cytochrome protein. More interestingly, the Cyt c Y67H variant showed the k cat /K m value towards classical guaicol catalytic reaction not only the highest among the cytochrome c variants but also higher than that of native horseradish peroxidase under the same condition. A wide range of spectroscopic studies and biocatalytic activity assay provide important insight into the structureproperty-reactivity-function relationship of hemoproteins.

Contact e-mail: kohzuma@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp Weak non-covalent interactions in biological molecules including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids play important roles for expressing the specific functions and structures in many varieties of biological systems. Pseudoazurin (PAz) is a blue copper protein, which functions as the electron carrier in several microorganisms. The aromatic acid substitutants of PAz, Met16Phe, Met16Tyr, and Met16Trp were studied to elucidate the effect of weak indirect interactions involving pi-pi interaction on the active site structures and properties. Electronic absorption spectra of Met16X variants indicate the changes in the intensity of the two main LMCT transitions in the visible region. EPR spectra of Met16X variants at 77 K demonstrate that the copper site has two different conformers, characterized by rhombic and axial EPR signals. The EPR spectra indicate that the active structure is sufficiently flexible to be modulated by weak interactions between a ligand histidine imidazole ring and the newly introduced aromatic rings of Met16Phe, Met16Tyr, and Met16Trp. The spectroscopic and electrochemical results suggest the second shell weak interaction may have a role to modulate the structure and reactivity of blue copper protein active site. The fact that an object, for example, a protein, possesses a threedimensional structure seems an obvious concept. However, when the object is flexible, the concept is less obvious. Proteins are indeed not rigid, but may sample more or less wide ranges of different conformations. It has been recently proposed to call the range of sampled conformations the \"fourth dimension\" of a protein structure. 1 A particular, but quite common, case of conformational freedom is constituted by multidomain proteins, where two or more well structured and relatively rigid protein domains are tethered by linkers that are more or less flexible. In most cases, the function itself depends on flexibility. Static structural information from, e.g., X-ray, does not provide information on flexibility, and may even be misleading. Nuclear magnetic resonance is a better technique to detect dynamics and assess conformational heterogeneity. We have recently found that the presence of a paramagnetic metal in a metalloprotein permits the use of NMR in a novel way to describe the conformational freedom of protein domains 2 (i.e. their \"fourdimensional\" structure). A formally well defined way to define the reciprocal arrangements of the domains in terms of their Maximum Allowed Probability (MAP), is being proposed. Cytochrome oxidase forms the terminal step in the respiratory electron transfer chain. The dinuclear copper centre (CuA) at the subunit II of this enzyme is the electron entry site of the enzyme. The CuA site has been shown to exist in a charge-delocalised form or in a valance trapped form, and both of these two forms have been proposed to be important for the function of the enzyme. Studies on the CuA site from various sources have indicated that these two forms exist in a pH coupled equilibrium. The present talk will describe some of our recent studies on the stability of the CuA site and the role of proton transfer on the stability of the active conformation of the metal center. The results will be discussed in the light of understanding the possible role of these two forms on the biological electron transfer mediated by the CuA center. Contact e-mail: ortwin.meyer@uni-bayreuth.de CO dehydrogenase of Oligotropha carboxidovorans oxidises CO at a unique bimetallic [CuSMoO 2 ] cluster in its active site (1). Posttranslational cluster assembly involves the gene functions coxDEFG. Insertional mutagenesis of coxD had the following consequences: (i) The resulting mutant OM5D::km was unable to utilize CO under chemolithoautotrophic conditions, but (ii) retained the ability to utilize H 2 . (iii) When grown with H 2 and induced with CO, OM5D::km synthesized non-functional apo-CO dehydrogenase. (iv) EPR, EXAFS and crystallography revealed a [MoO 3 ] centre in the active site of the apo-enzyme, which (v) could be reconstituted to a functional [CuSMoO 2 ] cluster employing sulphide and Cu(I)-thiourea. CoxD is a MoxR-like AAA+ ATPase, enzymes involved in ATP dependent processes of protein refolding and degradation (2) and a member of the APE2220 phylogenetic subfamily of MoxR-proteins (3) . The coxD gene is adjacent to coxE which contains a Von Willebrand Factor Type A (VWA) domain, and both genes are part of a cox gene cluster (4). These features separate the APE2220 subfamily from the PA2707 subfamily of MoxR. We present evidence that CoxD operates as a molecular chaperone assisting CoxEFG and other essential functions to mediate the posttranslational insertion of sulphur and copper into the CO dehydrogenase active site and the subsequent assembly to a catalytically competent [CuSMoO 2 ] cluster. Nitrile hydratase (NHase) family proteins are Co-or Fe-containing enzymes having two post-translationally modified cysteine ligands, cysteine-sulfinic acid (Cys-SO 2 H) and cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). NHase family proteins require their specific activator proteins for the functional expression. Here, we show the function of the activator protein, P15K, for thiocyanate hydrolase (SCNase), a Co-type NHase family protein. When P15K was co-expressed with , or subunit of SCNase in Escherichia coli, only the subunit which contained all ligand residues formed a stable complex ( P15K) with a stoichiometry of : P15K = 1: 1. It is of interest that the subunit was expressed as inclusion bodies when it was expressed solely. Then, we studied the effect of Co ion on the expression of P15K. When P15K was expressed in the Coenriched medium, the isolated subunit as well as P15K was obtained. Both the isolated subunit and P15K incorporated significant amount of Co ions and possessed the Cys-SO 2 H modification like native SCNase. Considering that P15K has significant amino acid sequence similarity with the subunit and that the metal-binding site is located at the interface between and subunits, the function of P15K is to associate with the subunit and to assist the Co-incorporation as well as the generation of the cysteine modifications. We have been trying to reconstitute SCNase from P15K and the subunit. Based on the results obtained, we will discuss the maturation mechanism of the Co-type NHase family proteins.",

Contact e-mail: pierattelli@cerm.unifi.it Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy plays a prominent role in the characterization of proteins and their interactions with other molecules. Solution structures have been determined for several paramagnetic systems by using 1 H NMR-based experiments, and in several cases paramagnetic effects have been exploited to derive structural information useful for refinement of a structure. 1 The magnitude of paramagnetic effects on nuclear relaxation rates depends on the nature of the metal ion and its electronic relaxation rate. Depending on the metal-nucleus distance, electron-nucleus coupling effects may prevent the observation of the proton signals of residues close to the metal site, due to induced broadening of the NMR lines. This is the case for type II copper(II)-containing proteins, where protons close to the paramagnetic copper center are characterized by relaxation rates too large to be studied with a conventional NMR approach. 2 Carbon-13 direct-detection NMR offers advantages for the study of paramagnetic proteins because paramagnetic dipolar contributions to nuclear relaxation depend on the square of the gyromagnetic ratio of the observed nucleus; thus, a switch from 1 H to 13 C detection guarantees a sizable decrease in relaxation rates. 3;4 This is demonstrated in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, where 13 C directdetection NMR experiments enable detection of resonances as close as 6 \u00c5 from the metal ion, and allow determination of structural restraints necessary for structure refinement. 5 Solid-state NMR, that is developed on 13 C direct-detection, provides an additional tool for the NMR investigation of Cu(II)-containing proteins. 6 NMR experiments have been used to investigate s-ms motions in heme oxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa-HO) in its ferric state, inhibited by CN\u00af (pa-HO-CN) and N 3\u00af (pa-HO-N 3 ), and in its ferrous state, inhibited by CO (pa-HO-CO). Comparative analysis of the data indicates that the distal ligand affects the conformational freedom of the polypeptide in regions removed from the heme. Interpretation of the dynamical information in the context of the structure of pa-HO shows that secondary structure harboring residues involved in the network of structural H-bonded waters undergo s-ms motions in pa-HO-CN, which was studied as a model of the resting state form. In comparison, similar motions are suppressed in the pa-HO-CO and pa-HO-N 3 complexes, which were studied as mimics of the oxyferrous and ferric hydroperoxide intermediates. These findings suggest that in addition to proton delivery to the nascent Fe III -OO\u00af, the H-bonding network serves two additional roles: (i) propagate the electronic state in each of the catalytic cycle steps to key but remote sections of the polypeptide via small rearrangements and (ii) modulate the conformational freedom of the enzyme, thus allowing it to adapt to the demanding changes in axial coordination and substrate transformations taking place during a catalytic cycle. This idea was probed by disrupting the H-bonding network by replacing R80 for L. rc-CPMG studies revealed that the mutant exhibits nearly global conformational motions that are absent in wild type pa-HO-N 3 . These \"chaotic\" motions in R80L-pa-HO-N 3 are likely related to its significantly lower efficiency to hydroxylate heme. We have also found that the peptide is able to bind manganese in a specific metal binding site, which could be a binding site for calcium. The structure is deposited in PDB as 1JJZ.",

Multi-heme proteins and enzymes are important constituents of bacterial electron transfer chains and are involved in many respiratory processes. In sulfate-reducing bacteria the tetraheme protein cytochrome c 3 and the nonaheme cytchrome c play important roles in transferring electrons between the [Ni,Fe]hydrogenase and membrane-bound respiratory complexes [1]. In nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, a multi-heme PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-ADH) may also serve as a protectant for the oxygen-labile nitrogenase [2] . The PQQ-ADH of G. diazotrophicus is a heterodimer composed of SU I (PQQ cofactor and one c-type cytochrome) and SU II (three ctype cytochromes). This latter PQQ-ADH is rather unique in the sense that the heme centers remain in the reduced Fe(II) state even when isolated in the presence of dioxygen. We will describe the redox properties of the four different c-type cytochromes in the ADH from G. diazotrophicus by applying UV/Vis-and EPR spectroscopy-monitored redox titrations. Preliminary electrochemistry measurements are also included. An intramolecular electron transfer (IET) pathway between the c-type heme centers within subunits I and II, and to the ubiquinone is proposed.",

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a Gram-negative, and spiral-shaped bacterium, has been known to be the causative agent of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers. The organism produces a large amount of a nickel-containing enzyme urease, which is believed to neutralize gastric acid by producing ammonia for the survival of the bacteria. [1, 2] A constant supply of nickel is therefore essential for the synthesis and activity of nickel-containing enzymes. Several histidine-rich proteins and domains have been found in H. pylori. [2] Hpn (28 His-residues out of 60 aa) is a small cytoplasmic protein and is present as a multimer with 20-mer being the predominant species in solution and binds to five Ni 2+ and four Bi 3+ per monomer moderately (K d of 7.1 and 11.1 M respectively). [3] Although in vitro, it binds to Cu 2+ stronger than Ni 2+ and Bi 3+ , the in vivo protection by the protein is in the order of Ni 2+ > Bi 3+ > Cu 2+ . [4] Hpn may therefore serve to buffer intracellular Ni 2+ in much the same way as that the small and cysteine-rich protein, metallothionein interacts with Zn 2+ /Cu + . [ The formation of the hyponitrite species from two NO molecules is the key intermediate in the reduction of NO to N 2 O in denitrification. The reaction is used by bacteria as an alternative to oxygen-based respiration. The bacterial Nitric oxide reductase (Nor) and the ba 3 -oxidoreductase from Thermus thermophilus catalyze the reduction of NO to N 2 O. Here we report on the formation of the hyponitrite species in the heme a 3 Fe/Cu B binuclear center of ba 3oxidoreductase from T. thermophilus. The N-N bond ( N-N = 1334 cm -1 ) of the hyponitrite-bound to the heme Fe is detected only under 244 nm Raman excitation, and the bending vibration of heme Fe-N-OH at 624 cm -1 under 428 nm Raman excitation. The N-N is sensitive to pH and pD exchanges indicating the interaction of the hyponitrite species with a H 2 O molecule. We propose a mechanism for the formation of the hyponitrite species that is initiated by the reduction of Cu B by NO. With the identification of the hyponitrite species the hypothesis of a common phylogeny of aerobic respiration and bacterial denitrification is fully supported and the mechanism for the 2e -/2H + reduction of NO to N 2 O can be described with more certainty. The thermodynamics of the one-electron reduction of the ferric heme in wild-type and mutated heme Synechocystis catalaseperoxidase and human myeloperoxidase were determined through spectro-electrochemical experiments [1, 2] . The data are interpreted in terms of ligand binding features, electrostatic effects and solvation properties of the heme environment. Reduction-induced solvent reorganization effects turn out to be the major effectors of reduction entropy and influence reduction enthalpy, which mainly depends on the anionic character of the proximal histidine and the polarity of the heme environment. The [NiFe]-hydrogenase protein expressed in many bacteria such as E. coli and H. pylori is a protein that contains an intricate metal core required for the reversible production of two protons and two electrons from hydrogen gas. It is known that the assembly of the hydrogenase metal cluster involves the coordinated activity of a number of helper proteins to deliver all of the correct components and assemble the metallocenter correctly (1). However, very little is known about the mechanisms of action of the specific components, how they interrelate or interact with each other, or how metal selectivity is achieved. The accessory protein, HypB, is necessary for Ni(II) insertion in to the NiFe cluster of hydrogenase in E. coli. By using XAS data and mutagenic studies we have been able to form a structural picture of the high and low-affinity metal sites present in the HypB protein (2) . We have determined the amino acid ligands in addition to the geometry around the Ni(II) ion in both the high-affinity and lowaffinity metal site. The low-affinity site, a possible structural site, has a stronger preference for Zn(II) and the ligands and geometry for this metal were also resolved. Further analysis also indicates that there may be communication between the two metal domains. These data provides valuable insight into the structural configuration of HypB and the mechanism of Ni(II) delivery into hydrogenase. Iron is an essential element for living organisms. Ironically, iron is highly toxic to cells since free iron can promote the production of hydroxyl free radicals via the Fenton Reaction. Here we reported the interplay of the iron binding between the iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein IscA and the Friedreich's ataxia protein frataxin, under physiological and oxidative stress conditions. Previous studies indicated that both IscA and frataxin are able to bind iron. However, their iron binding mechanisms are very different. In IscA, the invariant three cysteine resideus are required for the iron binding. On the other hand, the carboxyl groups of the highly conserved aspartate and glutamate residues in frataxin are essential for the iron binding. In this study, we have shown that in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system which emulates intracellular redox potential, frataxin fails to bind any iron even at a 10-fold excess of iron. IscA, on the other hand, can efficiently recruit iron and transfers the iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, however, IscA completely loses its iron binding activity due to the oxidation of the thiol groups, whereas frataxin becomes a competent ironbinding protein and attenuates the iron-mediated production of hydroxyl free radicals. The results suggest that IscA is capable of recruiting intracellular iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly under normal physiological conditions, whereas frataxin may serve as an iron chaperon to sequester redox active free iron and alleviate cellular oxidative damage under oxidative stress conditions.",

X-ray data are routinely collected at or around absorption edge in order to exploit anomalous scattering for phase determination, but the additional information contained in these edges -as used in X-ray absorption spectroscopy -is commonly not utilized in crystallography. We have established a method for refining anomalous scattering contributions for individual atoms within a crystal structure for multiple data sets collected along an absorption edge [1], yielding information on redox state and electron distribution at each atom. This allows for the detailed analysis of redox events and the tracing of electron flow within protein systems. The test case of an antiferromagnetically coupled [2Fe:2S] cluster is presented, where a mixed-valence reduced state with localized charges confirms the reliability of the approach, and implications for highly complex metal clusters are discussed. Sulfite oxidizing enzymes (SOEs) are physiologically vital and occur in all forms of life. During the catalytic cycle the fivecoordinate square-pyramidal oxo-molybdenum active site passes through the Mo(V) state, and intimate details of the structure can be obtained from pulsed EPR spectroscopy through the hyperfine interactions (hfi) and nuclear quadrupole interactions (nqi) of nearby magnetic nuclei (e.g., 1 H, 2 H, 17 O, 31 P, 33 S). By employing spectrometer operational frequencies ranging from ~4 to ~32 GHz, it is possible to make the nuclear Zeeman interaction significantly greater than the hfi and nqi, and thereby simplify the interpretations of the spectra. The SOEs exhibit three general types of Mo(V) structures which differ in the number of nearby exchangeable protons (one, two or zero). The CW-EPR and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) data for sulfite oxidase from Arabidopsis thaliana (At-SO) that has been reduced to Mo(V) at pH = 6 with sulfite labeled with 33 S (I = 3/2) show no exchangeable protons and a 33 S hyperfine interaction whose magnitude (a iso = 4.8 MHz) demonstrates the presence of coordinated sulfate, a postulated intermediate in the catalytic cycle of sulfite oxidizing enzymes. The fatal R160Q mutant of human sulfite oxidase also shows 33 S couplings from bound sulfate. These are the first examples of direct detection of coordinated sulfate in molybdenum enzymes and only the second case of pulsed EPR detection of a 33 S -metal ion interaction in metalloenzymes.",

Contact e-mail: hiro@ims.ac.jp Denitrification is an important component of the global nitrogen cycle that is responsible for regulating the amount of fixed nitrogen available for plant growth. In denitrification process, the reduction of NO2-to NO is catalyzed by nitrite reductase, containing either heme cd1 or copper. The x-ray crystal structures of coppercontaining nitrite reductases (Cu-NiRs) show a common reaction center, containing a pair of copper ions, type-1 Cu and type-2 Cu. The type-1 Cu site has (His)2-Cys-Met donor set, which is typical for electron-transfer copper proteins. On the other hand, the type-2 Cu site has three histidine ligands, (His)3, and a water as the fourth ligand in the resting state. The type-2 Cu site has been suggested to be a reaction center where nitrite is reduced to NO with an electron transferred from the type-1 Cu site. The (His)3 coordination environment is highly conserved in all Cu-NiRs. In order to investigate the functional role of the (His)3 coordination environment in the type-2 Cu site, we set out to prepare copper(I)nitrite complexes from sterically hindered tris(4-imidazolyl)carbinol (TIC) and tris(pyrazolyl)methane (TPM) ligands to mimic the (His)3 coordination environment in the type-2 Cu site of CuNiR. Particularly, the copper(I) nitrite complex having sterically hindered tris(4-imidazolyl)carbinol is expected to be the best model complex for the copper(I) nitrite complex in Cu-NiR. We report here synthesis, structural features, spectroscopic properties, and reactivity of copper(I) nitrite complexes with sterically hindered TIC and TPM ligands.",

Contact e-mail: Reza_Ghiladi@NCSU.edu Catalase-peroxidases (KatG) are bifunctional hemoproteins possessing both catalase and peroxidase activities. The crystal structures of different KatGs each revealed the presence of a novel active site modification comprised of two covalent bonds between three amino acid side chains: Trp107, Tyr229, and Met255 (Mycobacterium tuberculosis numbering). Absent from the peroxidases, this Met-Tyr-Trp 'crosslink' has been suggested to impart catalase activity to the KatGs, although how it carries out this function has been the subject of recent debate. To better understand the role which the crosslink plays in enzyme catalysis, we have expressed several KatG(Tyr229UAA) mutants, where UAA represents the following unnatural amino acids: p-Ac, p-NH 2 , p-N 3 , p-Br, p-I, and p-OMe derivatives of phenylalanine. Notably, these mutants exhibit up to a 300-fold increase in peroxidase catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) compared to the WT enzyme (see Table) . Specifically, k cat was enhanced by ~20-60 fold, whereas K m was improved slightly (~1-8 fold), indicating that the gain in catalytic efficiency is mainly from increasing the rate of the peroxidase reaction, with only a minor contribution from improving substrate binding. While these KatG mutants were unable to form Met-UAA-Trp crosslinks, resulting in loss of catalase activity, they nevertheless represent one of the first examples in hemoprotein engineering where an enzymatic activity has been enhanced through the use of UAAs. Details of these and our complementary stoppedflow UV-visible spectroscopic studies will be presented.",

Adamantane analogs linked through hydrocarbon or polyether linkers bind in the active site channel of P450cam, inducing a large range of conformational changes in the F and G helix regions. Benzimidazole analogs attached to peptide linkers bind to an engineered channel in place of the electron transfer pathway of CcP, allowing the electron transfer to be probed though an electrode interface.

            "text": "Recently convincing evidence has emerged of involvement of the S.cerevisiae Narf-family member, Nar1, in cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis [2] . In order to study the iron-sulfur clusters of Nar1 we have cloned and over-expressed the protein in S.cerevisiae and E.coli. EPR monitored redox titrations were performed to characterize the iron-sulfur cluster(s) and additional paramagnetic centers in the protein. The hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus has a highly specific ABC transporter for the internalization of tungstate [1], which it uses to make five tungstoenzymes with a wide range of aldehyde oxidizing activities [2] . One of the enzymes, formaldehyde : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (FOR) activates free (i.e. non-hydrated) formaldehyde [3] . In addition to a tungsto-bispterin cofactor these enzymes contain an electron transferring iron-sulfur cubane that heavily dominates the optical spectra making mechanistic studies through optical monitoring difficult. EPR monitoring of paramagnetic W(V) intermediates is not a viable alternative since substrate oxidation is essentially an electron pair reaction coupled to the one-step reduction of W(VI) to W(IV) [3] . However, molybdopterin and tungstopterin cofactors do exhibit relatively weak optical absorptions, typically visible 2 cm -1 mM -1 , and this property has been used previously in a pre steady state kinetics study on DMSO reductase, an enzyme that has a single molybdopterin cofactor only. We have now identified substrateinduced weak optical changes of the tungstopterin in P. furiosus FOR, and we have used these for monitoring pre-steady state kinetics employing stopped-flow absorption spectrometry. Nitrate reductase A from Escherichia coli is a membrane-bound molybdoenzyme which catalyses the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. This respiratory complex is composed of a catalytic subunit (NarG) containing a Mo-bisMGD cofactor (Moco), an electron transfer subunit (NarH) carrying four FeS clusters, and a membrane subunit (NarI) with two b-type hemes (1). The resolution of the 3D structure of NarGHI has revealed the existence of a fifth FeS cluster (FeS0) with a His-(Cys)3 coordination located close to the Moco (2). In the first EPR studies this cluster had escaped detection but recently, low intensity EPR lines around g = 5 and typical of a S = 3/2 species were proposed to arise from it (3) . A detailed analysis of the EPR signal of this S = 3/2 species enabled us to quantify accurately its stoichiometry. In addition, by mutating its amino acid ligands we assigned definitively the S = 3/2 signal to the FeS0 center. Moreover we have taken advantage of its peculiar characteristics to show that the FeS0 cluster and the Moco are strongly related during the metal insertion processes occurring in the biogenesis pathway of the enzyme (4). In particular, we demonstrate that the sequential insertion of these two metal centers is orchestrated by a single accessory protein. Nitric oxide (NO) is a major biological mediator generated in mammals exclusively by proteins from the NO-Synthase family (NOS). To explain their implication in both processes of signalling and cytotoxicity, it has been proposed that after NO biosynthesis, NOSs can partition in two distinct catalytic cycles via two different complexes: i) Fe III NO complex whose dissociation leads to NO (signalling) ii) Fe II NO complex, whose oxidation produces other reactive nitrogen species (toxicity) with transient formation of peroxynitrite (PN).",

This PN activation led to iNOS self-inhibition which could serve as a physiological feedback regulation 1 . Lately we investigated the activation of PN by other NOS isoforms, involved in different physiological pathways. Each isoform displays a distinct PN activation mechanism ranging from toxicity enhancement to detoxification. Finally, we have been investigating the structure-reactivity relationship of NOS Fe II NO complex by combining spectroelectrochemistry, pulsed and classic EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. We focus on parameters such as the heme structure and environment. Correlated with the kinetic analysis of Fe II NO oxidation, these results will lead us to suggest parameters that could promote in situ PN production. This work open new perspectives for the study and the understanding of NOSs functioning and biological role. Our studies have focused on 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase, an ascorbate-dependent non-heme iron enzyme that produces the plant hormone ethylene, important in many aspects of plant growth and development (i.e. germination, fruit ripening, and senescence). 1 In order to study the mode of O 2 activation by ACC oxidase, steady-and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses and 18 O kinetic isotope effect measurements were employed to determine the order of substrates binding, the nature of the activated iron-oxygen species involved in substrate oxidation, and to characterize the intermediates that accumulate during catalytic turnover. Several ACC substrate analogues that can inhibit ethylene production have been kinetically investigated with the goal of designing a mechanism-based inhibitor. 2 The use of radioactively labeled analogues has been employed to determine the fate of substrate breakdown products. Recent detection of radioactive labeling of specific residues in the active site and subsequent enzyme inactivation suggests an alternative mechanism for substrate oxidation in ACC oxidase. ",

Previous studies revealed several properties of VnfA based on in vivo activity assays, while investigation on the molecular structure including a sensing mechanism of an effector molecule was thwarted due to difficulty to purify VnfA. In the present study, we have achieved purification of wild type VnfA and preparation of the variants where Cys residues are replaced to alanine to inspect the role of Cys residues since Cys rich sequences in N-terminus of VnfA, Cys8-X-Cys10-XXXX-Cys15 has been suggested to bind any metals or metal clusters to form the sensory part. Superoxide reductases (SORs) are antioxidant enzymes that eliminate the toxic superoxide anion solely by the reductive pathway in contrast with their counterparts, superoxide dismutases (SODs) that catalyze both reduction and oxidation of this radical. In this reaction SOR utilize cellular reductants to convert superoxide into hydrogen peroxide without forming molecular oxygen. These proteins are associated with anaerobic lifestyle since they are found only in anaerobic or microaerophilic prokaryotes, and, in many cases where the canonical SODs are absent, they constitute the only known protecting system against superoxide. The reaction mechanism of SOR from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus was previously studied by pulse radiolysis, allowing the observation of a putative ferrichydroperoxide intermediate, which decayed upon protonation to produce hydrogen peroxide. We also demonstrated the role of glutamate (E12) in the protonation of the Fe 3+ -OOH intermediate; this residue also functions as the sixth ligand to the oxidized iron center. The glutamate ligand is highly conserved among known SORs with only a few exceptions. Here we study by pulse radiolysis the reduction of superoxide by a natural glutamate-lacking \"mutant\", and show that this enzyme is fully functional. This suggests that the enzyme has evolved divergently to be able to efficiently protonate the intermediate in the absence of a glutamate.",

We have demonstrated that a recombinant NOS from Bacillus subtilis catalyses the transformation of several hydroxyguanidines to the corresponding ureas and cyanamides and the nitration of phenol in a peroxydase catalytic pathway. Cytochromes c are essential metalloproteins found in virtually all organisms and are involved in many fundamental processes including electron transfer in respiratory chains. In E. coli the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes depends on a complex, multicomponent post-translational system expressed from the cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) operon ccmABCDEFGH. Central to this system is the heme chaperone CcmE which binds heme in the bacterial periplasm before transferring the cofactor for covalent attachment to apocytochromes c. CcmE has been found to have unusual properties including covalent binding via a histidine residue to a heme vinyl group [1,2], tyrosine ligation of the heme iron [3] , a change in coordination depending on the iron oxidation state [4] involving residues in the flexible C-terminal domain of the protein [5]. We present results on these phenomena and discuss their implications. Diketone cleaving dioxygenase Dke1, which has been isolated from Acinetobacter johnsonii, shows unique catalytic properties, oxygenatively cleaving the C-C bond of enolizable beta-diketones to the corresponding acid and alpha-oxo aldehyde. Its active site shows an atypical nonheme Fe(II) centre, which is not ligated via the 'classical' 2-His-1-carboxylate motif but via a facial triad of three histidines (1). The substrate's electronic properties govern the rate of dioxygen reduction and results from quantitative structureactivity relationship analysis lead to the proposal of a chemical mechanism of diketone cleavage in Dke1 (2). But what role does the protein environment play in catalysis? Investigating the impact of the metal's second coordination sphere on particular steps of catalysis by mutational and kinetic analysis, we identified a gate constituted of three amino acid residues that promotes diketone binding and oxidation. A basal reactivity of the metallocentre towards 'alien' (non-beta-dicarbonyl) substrates, on the other hand, is apparently insensitve towards alterations in the metal's second sphere, and demonstrates the intrinsic reactivity of the 3-His metallocentre towards 'typical' dioxygenase substrates. Taken together, our findings give interesting insights into the interplay of metallocentre, protein environment and substrate structure in Dke1. ",

For this reason, UV-Vis spectroscopy is a principal technique in studying the structure and function of redox proteins. Its downsides are the low sensitivity and selectivity. To circumvent these problems, we have used fluorescent labeling to translate these absorption changes into a fluorescence signal with the benefits of enhanced selectivity combined with single-molecule sensitivity 1 . Here we report on an extension of this methodology to study redox processes in SLAC, a multicopper laccase from S. coelicolor. It couples the four electron reduction of dioxygen with the oxidation of small organic substrates. Laccases contain two chromophores: a blue type-1 copper site, which accepts electrons from reducing substrate, as well as a green trinuclear Cu 3 copper cluster, which is the site of O 2 reduction (see figure) . The optical absorption of these centers depends on their oxidation state. We show that the redox-state of the type-1 site and the Cu 3 cluster can be simultaneously and independently monitored by following the emission of two different fluorescent reporters. Several examples illustrating the technique as well as potential applications will be discussed. We have determined the 1.8 \u00c5 X-ray crystal structure of a monoheme c-type cytochrome, cytochrome P460, from Nitrosomonas europea. The chromophore possesses unusual spectral properties analogous to those of the catalytic heme P460 of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), the only known heme in biology to withdraw electrons from substrate coordinated to the iron. The analysis reveals a homodimeric structure and elucidates a new ctype cytochrome fold that is predominantly -sheet. In addition to the two cysteine thioether links to the porphyrin typical of c-type hemes, there is a third proteinaceous link involving a conserved lysine. The covalent bond is between the lysine side-chain nitrogen and the 13'-meso carbon of the heme, which following cross-link formation is sp 3 hybridized demonstrating loss of conjugation at this position within the porphyrin. The structure has implications for the analogous tyrosine-heme meso carbon cross-link observed in HAO.",

The assembly of the hydrogenase metallocenters requires SlyD and the proteins encoded by the hyp genes (hypABCDEF) [1, 2]. SlyD is a member of the FK-506 binding protein family of Peptidyl-prolyl Isomerase (PPIase) [3] . In addition to its PPIase domain, SlyD is composed of a molecular chaperone domain and a C-terminal tail rich in potential metal binding residues. SlyD directly interacts with HypB and the disruption of the SlyD-HypB complex results in deficient hydrogenase production in vivo [2, 4] . To examine the role of SlyD in hydrogenase biosynthesis, mutations that disrupt the PPIase activity were prepared. SlyD(I42S, F132Y) and SlyD(I42S), which displayed 1% and 40% of wild-type levels of PPIase activity respectively, could restore 61% \u00b110 and 41% \u00b19 of total hydrogenase activity in vivo. Both mutants interacted with HypB in vitro and accumulated the same level of cellular nickel under anaerobic growth condition. These results suggest that the PPIase activity of SlyD does not contribute to cellular nickel accumulation or hydrogenase activity. Additional in vivo experiments suggest that the SlyD-HypB complex may play a role in nickel storage in E.coli. Laccase (EC 1.10.3.1) is a four copper oxidase that catalyze the oxidation by molecular oxygen of phenols up to phenoxyl radicals, which can evolve up to quinones. These are reduced by ascorbic acid (vitamin C) which oxidizes to dehydroascorbic acid. The spectrophotometric assays of laccase oxidizing ABTS in presence of ascorbic acid, they show a lag period proportional to the concentration of this vitamin. The assay conditions, reaction medium, concentration of enzyme and of chromogenic substrate have been optimized. A broad linear range with submicromolar limits of detection and of quantitation of ascorbic acid has been reached. The sensitivity of the method was higher for Trametes versicolor than for Agaricus bisporus laccase. The test is sensitive, precise and quick and requires low quantities of sample. The method has been applied to assays of quality control in drugs that contain vitamin C as active ingredient. Furthermore, the method is useful to evaluate the antioxidant activity of ascorbic acid. The assay does not require electrochemical neither spectrofluorimetric instruments. The method is applicable on spectrophotometers (1mL cuvette) and on multiwell microplate readers, which favours its mechanization for high throughput screen assays. Rubredoxin (Rd) is a small protein (~5 kDa), containing a simple redox centre (one iron atom coordinated to four cysteinyl residues), present in all species of the Desulfovibrio genus. Rd has been assigned to play an important role in the oxygen detoxification pathway, donating electrons to enzymes such as superoxide reductase and rubredoxin:oxygen oxido-reductase. In the oxidized form, the inherent high-spin of the Fe(III) ion can be used to probe the interaction site of other metalloproteins, in particular using NMR methods, due to the induced pseudocontact shift and linewidth broadening. In this study, we used Desulfovibrio gigas Rd (both Fe and Zn-substituted forms) and cytochrome c 3 , a tetraheme containing protein, isolated from the same organism, as a model of a transient electron transfer complex. In order to determine these effects we have used 1 H NMR titrations. We have observed that increasing amounts of rubredoxin induce selective heme methyl shifts and linewidth broadenings (only with the Fe form), and an apparent Kd of ~10 M was determined. These results are in agreement with the higher ranked complexes obtained using a softdocking algorithm program, BiGGER 1 , that predicted a cluster of solutions with Rd binding near the heme IV of cytochrome c 3 . Thanks to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, sulfur dioxide and sulfites have been used as food additives for many years. However, sulfites have been occasionally implicated as asthma triggers [1]. As a consequence, the EC Directive 95/2/EC includes sulfites in the list of preservatives and antioxidants endorsed in specified products with a Maximum Permitted Level [2] . The classical methods for sulfite determination in food products are time consuming and have a low sensitivity. Therefore, is very important to develop a new analytical tool capable of easily quantifying sulfites in complex samples. With the aim of constructing an electrochemical sulfite biosensor based on a selective enzyme, we have been studying and characterizing the dissimilatory sulfite reductase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 -Desulfoviridin (Dsv) The enzyme is composed by three subunits of ca. 50, 40 and 11 kDa, all of them showing a strong homology to Dsv from Desulfovibrio vulgaris at the Nterminal. The iron content, as determined by ICP-AES was slightly lower than expected (17\u00b14). From the biosensor point-of-view, the low specific activity of Dsv (nmolmg -1 min -1 range) and the instability of sulfites in solution constitute important drawbacks that should be overcome. In this regard, we also examined by cyclic voltammetry the ability of a set of electronic mediators alternative to methyl viologen (phenosafranine, meldola blue/NADH, neutral red, benzyl viologen and bromophenol blue) to efficiently shuttle electrons to Dsv. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of structurally related nonheme iron containing dioxygenases. They catalyse the insertion of molecular oxygen into polyunsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more 1,4 pentadiene moieties to give the corresponding hydroperoxides. LOX products can be further metabolized to yield signaling molecules such as aldehydes and jasmonate. The insertion of oxygen exhibits high regio-and stereo-specificity. This specificity is dependent on the primary sequence of the enzyme, which is predicted to determine the orientation and depth of substrate penetration into the active site. Although there is an abundance of information on plant and animal LOXs, the number of prokaryotic LOXs that have been described is limited. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae are known as sources of biologically active compounds among which are alcohols, alkanes, aldehydes and branched hydrocarbons, which may derive from primary LOX products. Analysis of the genomic sequence of the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 revealed two genes with homology to the LOX of the prokaryotic organism Pseudomonas aerigunosa. The two enzymes, NpLOX1 and NpLOX2, were isolated and tested for catalytic activity against linoleic and -linolenic acid. Both proteins were identified as linoleate 13-LOXs by expression in E. coli. Interestingly, at the position of the postulated determinants of regiospecificity within the active site, the two enzymes contain different amino acids in comparison to known 13-LOXs. NpLOX1 was further characterized: It showed a broad pH optimum ranging from pH 4.5 to pH 8.5 with a maximum at pH 8.0 and -linolenic acid was the preferred substrate. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a gram-negative -proteobacterium isolated from the freshwater Lake Oneida, USA. Genomic analysis of this metal-reducing bacterium has identified 39 genes encoding c-type cytochromes[1] (determined using the c-type heme attachment motif, CXXCH), a large proportion of which contain multiple heme groups. This profusion of cytochromes confers upon the organism a wide respiratory flexibility and the ability to utilise a diverse range of electron acceptors, including Fe(III) and Mn(IV), nitrite, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfate and fumarate. A putative octaheme cytochrome, containing eight CXXCH motifs, with no homologs of known function has been identified and overexpressed. This protein has been purified and identified as a tetrathionate reductase, and the structure has been solved to 2.2 \u00c5. [2] , [3] Despite the presence of eight conventional hemeattachment motifs, the protein structure revealed the presence of seven normally ligated c-type heme groups and one unusual lysineligated CXXCK heme at the active site. This unconventional lysine heme ligation has been previously observed only in the pentaheme nitrite reductases, however in these cases lysine ligation was predicted by a CXXCK motif. Assays to determine potential substrates for this enzyme have shown activity with a range of nitrogen-containing compounds, including nitrite, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and hydroxylamine. Additionally, a mutant of the ligating lysine has been prepared and work is currently underway to determine its structure and kinetics. Laccases are four-copper containing enzymes exhibiting dual reactivity. Their ability to oxidize a large panel of substrates including recalcitrant environmental pollutants and to reduce molecular dioxygen into water makes them promising enzymes for the development of biosensors and biofuel cells, respectively. However, these applications require the challenging preparation of stable enzymes-coated electrodes with well-defined catalytic properties toward both substrates and dioxygen. We report the immobilization of a recombinant Trametes C30 LAC3[1] using the nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)/histidine-tag technology that requires mild protein modification. Analysis of the his-tagged LAC3 in solution indicates that addition of the polyhistidine moiety does not strongly affect its catalytic activity. Moreover, it allows formation of a stable enzyme monolayer on gold electrodes. The catalytic cycle of immobilized LAC3 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and analysed using available theory for ping-pong mechanisms and immobilized enzymes. [2] To achieve a complete analysis of LAC3, the kinetic characteristics of the immobilized enzyme were compared with their homogeneous counterparts. Our results indicate that high surface coverage of fully functional LAC3 can be obtained by using this immobilization procedure. COX11 is a copper-binding protein, which plays a crucial role in the incorporation of copper into the Cu B site of cytochrome c oxidase. In this study, we carried out the expression and characterization of human COX11 (hCOX11). The gene of hCOX11 codes 276 amino acids, parts of which are predicted to be present as trans-membrane helices. We cloned C-terminal soluble domain, Cys121-Asn276, in pPICZ B vector. The expression plasmid was used to transform into the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) X-33. The hCOX11 was expressed as a soluble form in P. pastoris under control of the inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promoter. The purified hCOX11 was observed at ~ 18 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This result is consistent with the molecular weight calculated from the translated cDNA sequence. The far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of hCOX11 showed characteristic features of a folded protein with beta-strands and alpha-helical structures. Analytical gel filtration showed that hCOX11 was eluted as dimmer with no effect induced by the reducing agent DTT. This behavior suggests that the dimerization would not involve formation of disulfide bonds. The mechanisms responsible of the dimerization and the interaction with copper are under study. The results will be present and discussed. Lactoperoxidase (LPO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) belong to the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily. Both enzymes are critical elements of the innate, i.e. nonantigenic immune system. Lactoperoxidase is a monomeric protein consisting of a single polypeptide that binds a modified heme via two ester linkages. By contrast, MPO is a dimeric protein with a single disulfide bridge between symmetry-related halves, each of which contains two polypeptides. In MPO the heme is also covalently attached to the protein via two ester bonds, but it is the only heme protein with an additional sulfonium ion linkage. The mode of heme binding strongly affects the biophysical and biochemical properties of these metalloproteins. In order to elucidate the effect of heme to protein linkages on the thermal and conformational stability of LPO and MPO in their ferric forms, we have performed comparative electronic absorbance, electronic circular dichroism and intrinsic steady-state fluorescence studies on protein unfolding by urea and guanidine hydrochloride as well as with increasing temperature both in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol. Determination of thermodynamic (free enthalpies, enthalpies and entropies) as well as kinetic parameters of denaturation revealed differences between LPO and MPO, which will be discussed with respect to the known structures of human MPO and bovine LPO. However, an accessory protein (MMOB) is required to regulate the reaction of substrates with Q. MMOB forms a specific complex with MMOH that controls access to Q on the basis of substrate size. This allows MMO to preferentially oxidize methane in the presence of other potential substrates with weaker C-H bonds. The binding of MMOB perturbs the spectroscopic characteristics of the diiron cluster as well as the extent to which the C-H bond breaking reaction proceeds by quantum tunneling. Thus, the effects of the surface interaction are transmitted to the MMOH active site. Using NMR relaxation and site directed spin-labeling, we have mapped the interface between the MMOH and MMOB components [1]. There are clear solvent exposed and buried MMOB surfaces in the complex, but the relative orientation of the two components could not be determined by these approaches. In current studies, fluorescence donor-acceptor pairs are placed on MMOH and MMOB so that the specific orientation of the two components can be mapped using FRET techniques. Supported by NIHGM40466. Complex I, NADH:quinone oxidoreductase, is the first and the biggest complex of all that constitute respiratory chain. This enzyme couples electron transfer from NADH to quinone to the proton translocation across the membrane, which contributes to the membrane electrochemical potential that is the driving force for ATP synthesis. Complex I is composed of multiple polypeptide subunits and contains several prosthetic groups involved in its activity. The fact that many mitochondrial diseases are related to complex I defects shows the need to know more about the structure and function of this large respiratory chain complex. Rhodothermus marinus complex I, our model system, is a NADH:menaquinone oxidoreductase and has been extensively characterized [1, 2] . The genes coding for R. marinus Nqo subunits are clustering in two operons, nqo1-7 (nqo A ) and nqo10-14 (nqo B ) and two independent genes, nqo8 and nqo9. [3] Our recent results concerning the identification of the subunits are reported. By mass spectrometry, of the complex in solution, was possible identified all the subunits of the complex. Using this same technique, with digest SDS-PAGE bands, were identified just the subunits that constitute the peripheral part of the complex, Nqo1-5 and Nqo9. The subunits Nqo1, Nqo3 and Nqo9 were also identified by immunoblotting with antibodies against subunits of Neurospora crassa Complex I. Photosynthetic (PET) and respiratory electron transport (RET) are physically separated in eukaryotic cells but share common components (e.g. plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f, cytochrome c6, plastocyanin etc.) in cyanobacteria. As in most other phototrophic prokaryotes, the intracytoplasmic membrane contains a dualfunction PET-RET system, whereas the cytoplasmic membrane contains only RET without photosynthetic reaction centres. In RET terminal respiratory oxidases (TROs) function as the final electron acceptor (\"electron sink\") reducing O2 to water in a concerted fourelectron transfer reaction. Genome and expression analysis suggest that cyanobacteria can contain one or more representatives of TROs from both the heme-copper oxidase superfamily and the non-copper or bd-type oxidase superfamily. A detailed genomic (29 strains, 19 completely sequenced genomes), sequence and structural (subunits I & II) analysis of cyanobacterial heme-copper oxidases and their putative electron donor proteins (cytochrome c6, plastocyanin and cytochrome cM) revealed that heterocyst-forming nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria usually have more than one gene for obligatory cytochrome c oxidase (aa3-type) and cytochrome c6. Many cyanobacterial strains lack genes encoding heme copper quinol oxidases. All cyanobacteria have a single-copy gene for cytochrome cM and plastocyanin (exceptions Gloebacter violaceus & Thermosynechococcus elongatus). These data are discussed with respect to known in vitro interactions between these metalloproteins and to physiological relevance. The S100 proteins are small, dimeric Ca 2+ -binding proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and cell growth, differentiation and mobility in vertebrates. Several studies indicate expression misregulation of these proteins in a number of cancers. The Ca 2+ binding sites are EF-hands. As in other EF-hand proteins, Ca 2+ binding to S100A2 elicits the displacement of an helix exposing a hydrophobic patch which is the docking site for proteins involved in downstream signalling. The most studied one is transcription factor p53. Besides binding Ca 2+ , S100A2 also binds Zn 2+ with high affinity. Each S100A2 monomer binds two Zn 2+ ions in sites different from the Ca 2+ ones. The physiological role of Zn 2+ seems to be the modulation of the Ca 2+ affinity, as Zn 2+ binding to one of the sites decreases the binding affinity of the Ca 2+ , a unique mechanism in the S100 family so far. Our current research goal is to characterize the conformational and stability properties of S100A2 discriminating the effect of the binding of each metal to its cognate site. To accomplish this, engineered forms of S100A2 with mutated Zn 2+ cysteine ligands were used. Biophysical and biochemical techniques such as circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies have been employed in assessing conformational changes dependent of temperature, chemical denaturant concentration and metal loading status. Here we report the effects of Zn 2+ binding to the high affinity site and discuss its repercussions in the physiology and conformational tuning of S100A2. ",

            "text": "In mammalian cells, L-arginine is metabolized by two major pathways: arginases catalyze its hydrolysis to L-ornithine and urea, whereas NO synthases (NOSs) catalyze its oxidation to L-citrulline and nitric oxide, NO. NO is an important biological molecule involved in vasodilation, neurotransmission and immune responses. Recent studies support the hypothesis that arginases may be essential in the regulation of NOSs activities by modulating local Larginine concentration and it is observed that inhibition of arginases led to an enhancement of NO production. The search for potent inhibitors of arginases is thus the focus of active studies. L-Arginine hydrolysis by arginases is achieved by a metal-activated water molecule that bridges a (Mn II ) 2 cluster at their active site. The hydrolysis is postulated to proceed through a tetrahedral intermediate resulting from nucleophilic attack of a (Mn II ) 2 -bound hydroxide ion at the guanidinium carbon of L-arginine. Using X-ray data and a model proposed to explain the inhibitory effects of Larginine analogues, we have synthesized and tested new aminoacids as putative inhibitors of rat liver arginase. EPR spectroscopy has been used to study their positionings at the (Mn II ) 2 active site. The present poster will resume results obtained in our search for arginase inhibitors. Bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) are bacterial photoreceptors that sense red/far-red light and bind a biliverdin chromophore, an immediate breakdown product of heme (1). Bacteriophytochromes are known to regulate the biosynthesis of photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic pigments and motility, but have a wider array of functions, only partially known. Here we describe the biochemical and spectroscopic analysis of a novel bacteriophytochrome, PA5442, from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The protein is composed of a PAS domain linked to a GGDEF and EAL output module that is involved respectively in synthesis (diguanylate cyclase) and degradation (phosphodiesterase) of the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP. GGDEF-EAL-containing proteins studied to date displayed either diguanylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase activity, but not both. To get insight into the function of PA5442, the protein was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and purified in the dark using affinity chromatography. Recombinant PA5442 has an apparent molecular mass of 106 kDa and shows the characteristic red/far-red-lightinduced photoreversibility of bonafide phytochromes. Steady-state absorption spectroscopy possibly indicates a bound heme, although to date it is not known if it is an intrinsic component of PA5442 and essential for its role in vivo. In this study, we focused on inhibition by CO of the NiFe active site by using EPR spectroscopy. From the so-called paramagnetic Ni-C species corresponding to an intermediate state on the catalytic mechanism, a paramagnetic CO-inhibited species can be trapped by incubation of hydrogenase under a controlled CO atmosphere. The resulting Ni-CO species displays light-sensitivity properties, as observed for the Ni-C species (2) . Upon irradiation monitored by EPR, we carefully explored the photosensitivity of the Ni-CO species and subsequent thermal recombination processes. This relates to the photodissociation of the Ni-bound CO and the concomitant proton transfer between terminal cysteine ligands of the Ni ion. This strategy has been used with hydrogenase mutants for which intramolecular gas diffusion was hampered by mutating residues in the channel close to the active site. (1).The protein is a monomer of 11.8 kDa and the cofactor contributes to a characteristic Uv-visible spectra with maximum absorption peaks at 480 and 338 nm (2) . The ORP was heterologously expressed in E. coli as an apo-protein. In this work we report the reconstitution of the Mo-Cu cluster using [MoS 4 ] 2and CuCl 2 in the over-expressed apo-protein. Biochemical characterization of the reconstituted protein was performed including Uv-visible spectra, metal content and EPR spectroscopy and the results were compared with the native protein. We are also presenting a preliminary biochemical characterization of an orange protein isolated from Desulfovibrio alaskensis. The metal content ratio determined by ICP for this protein is 2 Mo to a 1 Cu as found for D.gigas. The protein is also a monomer of approximately 12.8 kDa. The N-terminal of the D. alaskensis ORP was chemically sequenced and the NCBI alignment revealed an identity of 90 % homology with a MTH1175-like domain family protein predicted by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20 complete genome sequencing and annotation. The bacterial metabolism of aromatic compounds often proceeds via an initial dioxygenase-catalyzed dihydroxylation to yield cisdihydrodiol derivatives. A large range of mono-and polycyclic substrates have been reported to produce the corresponding enantiopure cis-dihydrodiol metabolites. However, to date, only a few data have been reported about the cis-dihydroxylation of compounds derived from heterocyclic arenes. In the recent years, direct evidence for the cis-dihydroxylation of N-methyl-2-pyridone by NDOS has been reported in our laboratory 1,2 ; a major dihydroxylated metabolite, N-methyl-cis-5,6-dihydro-5,6dihydroxy-2-pyridone was obtained from this substrate.",

The -hyroxo--carboxylato-dimetal core is a common structural feature in metallohydrolase active sites such as aminopeptidase and glycerophosphodiesterase. An interesting feature of the Co(II)substituted enzymes is the extent of magnetic exchange coupling between two high-spin Co(II) ions. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) can be used to measure the magnitude of exchange coupling between Co(II) ions. To demonstrate the principle, a study of two isostructural dicobalt complexes, [Co II Co II ( -O 2 CCH 3 ) 2 ( -OH)L 2 ]PF 6 (1) and [Co II Co III ( -O 2 CCH 3 ) 2 ( -OH)L 2 ](PF 6 ) 2 (2) (L = N , N , N -triazacyclononane), was conducted. In 1 both Co(II) ions are high-spin while in 2 the Co(III) is diamagnetic; there is no possibility of coupling in 2. The low temperature MCD spectra of 1 and 2 are nearly identical having peaks at 483, 506 and 535 nm which arise from the 4 T 1g 4 T 1g (P) d-d transition in Co(II). The MCD spectrum of 1 is twice as intense as that of 2 because diamagnetic Co(III) is MCD silent. The magnetization plots for 1 and 2 are very different, indicating that the ground states are different. Spin-orbit coupling and low symmetry combine to create a pseudo-Kramer's doublet ground state in single-ion 6-coordinate Co(II), and the magnetization data from 2 fit this model very well with g= 4.8. In coupled binuclear Co(II), spin-orbit coupling and low symmetry lead to a ground state manifold of two singlets and a doublet, separated by energies, E 1 and E 2 . The doublet is lower in energy for ferromagnetic coupling. The magnetization data for 1 fit well to the ferromagnetically coupled model with a g=9.6, E 1 =4.2 cm -1 and E 2 =8.5 cm -1 . Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough cytochrome c3 contains four hemes in a low-spin state with bis-histidinyl coordination. Highspin forms of cytochrome c3 can be generated by protonation of the axial ligands [1, 2] . In this work, high-spin forms of cytochrome c3 were generated by protonation of the axial histidine ligands in order to probe spin equilibrium (high/low), and to generate putative reactive species towards external ligands. The spin alterations occurring at extreme pH, the associated changes in redox potentials, as well as the reactivity towards external ligands (NO) were complementary studied by the conjunction of UV-visible, CD, NMR and EPR spectroscopies and electrochemistry. Since the square wave voltammograms obtained correspond to four successive oneelectron processes, the experimental data were fitted to the theoretical predictions for four similar but non-equivalent redox sites. The binding of NO to the high-spin forms of D.vulgaris Hildenborough cytochrome c3 indicates that low-spin/high-spin equilibrium may enhance the reactivity of the hemes towards the binding and eventually catalysis of small molecules [3] .

The EPR spectra of cryoreduced deoxyhemoglobin and deoxymyoglobin reveal three spectroscopically distinct low-valent species, which indicates that the deoxy precursors adopt different conformational substates. Reduction products of hexacoordinate ferrous cytochrome c and b 5 as well as those of Fe(II)-CO globins are Fe(II) porphyrin -anion radical species. The data thus show that the presence of the 6-th axial ligand in the low-valent intermediates favors localization of an unpaired electron in the porphyrin e g * orbitals, consistent with previous results for low-valent iron porphyrins models. The cryogenerated low-valent hemoprotein intermediates relax to the ferrous states at T > 200K. The spectroscopic properties of cryogenerated ferric cytochrome C and b 5 are similar to these for the resting ferric states. The products of cryooxidation of pentacoordinate ferrous globins and peroxidases as well as of the low-spin complexes of the ferrous globins with CO show EPR spectra with g eff < 6 characteristic of the quantum-mechanically admixed S=3/2, 5/2 ground states. The trapped species relax to the equilibrium ferric states upon annealing at T > 190K. and Paracoccus denitrificans revealed the presence of a functional homodimer containing two different multicopper sites: CuA and CuZ. CuA is a binuclear copper site that transfers electrons to the catalytic CuZ site, a novel mixed valence compound with a sulfide ion bridging a distorted tetrahedron of copper atoms. In order to clarify the complex mechanism of activation and catalysis of this enzyme we studied the interaction with the probable physiological electron donor: cytochrome c 552 from Pn. Activity tests show that the reduced cyt c 552 is able to transfer electrons to CuA promoting the catalysis of N 2 O. The nature of the short-lived ET complex is investigated using docking analysis performed with BiGGER 1 . This study shows a strong affinity of this cytochrome to a hydrophobic patch located near CuA centre and putative complexes involving a small group of key residues are proposed. The recognition of the two partners is driven by electrostatic interaction, while hydrophobic contacts produce the fine orientation at short distances. In comparison, horse heart cytochrome c isn't able to transfer electrons to N 2 OR from Pn and the docking analysis of this nonphysiological electrostatic ET complex doesn't point to a specific interaction. Kinetic studies and protein-protein 1 H-NMR titrations are in progress to completely characterize this ET complex. Human metallothionein-3 (hMT3), also named human neuronal growth inhibitory factor (hGIF), can inhibit the outgrowth of neuronal cells in the presence of brain extracts, a property not shared by MT-1/-2. In order to study the structure-property-reactivity-function relationship, including the roles played by the particular residues and by particular structural elements and to illustrate the possible molecular mechanism of the bioactivity of hGIF a systematic sitedirect mutagenesis on hGIF has been done. The structure ofdomain of hGIF, which was mainly responsible for the bioactivity of the entire protein, was predicted by the molecular dynamics simulation for the first time. The properties of hGIF and its mutants were characterized by a series of spectroscopy, the reactions of hGIF and its variants with DTNB, EDTA and SNOC were examined, and finally the bioactivity of hGIF variants were assayed by neuron culture experiments. From these studies we conclude that the bioactivity of hGIF is regulated by various factors, including the TCPCP motif, domaindomain interactions, the structure and stability of the metal-thiolate cluster and other unknown factors. The interaction between hGIF and amyloid beta peptide (A ) is another part of our research. It was reported that the level of hGIF mRNA was down-regulated in AD brains and hGIF could inhibit the aggregation of A in vitro. However, no detailed mechanism analysis has been carried out till now. The aim of our research is to explore the mechanism how hGIF inhibits the aggregation of A and provide information for potential drugs design for AD therapy. Copper is a micronutrient required for correct cellular functions but is toxic in excess. However, a strain of E. coli isolated from the faeces of copper-fed pigs can survive in copper-rich environments (up to 10 mM CuSO 4 ). This resistance is attributed to a plasmidborne pco operon. High copper levels induce expression of the operon proteins PcoABCDERS that interact in the periplasm to confer copper resistance. Both PcoA and PcoC are soluble proteins. We have demonstrated recently that PcoC (10.5 kDa) features two separate binding sites (K d ~ 10 -13 ) specific for Cu(I) and Cu(II) and effects intermolecular transfers of bound Cu(I) and Cu(II) with or without a change in oxidation state. Apoand Cu(I)Cu(II)-forms are intermediates in the two-step redox transfer processes. 1 We have also expressed and isolated PcoA (63.7 Da). Preliminary data suggest that it is a laccase-type multicopper oxidase that binds multiple copper ions, including a T1 blue copper and a trinuclear copper cluster at the active site. 2 It catalyses the oxidation of common laccase substrates, including para-phenylenediamine and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and requires excess copper for activity. Interactions between PcoA and PcoC under various conditions provide insight into how these two members of the pco operon proteins function cooperatively in the periplasm and contribute to this copper resistance in E. coli. Details of the expression, isolation and interaction study will be provided and discussed. Alkane monooxygenase (AlkB) is a membrane-spanning diiron alkane hydoxylase that is widely contained in bacteria that catalyze the oxidation of alkanes in the environment. Single mutations in a residue located in the presumed membrane-spanning substrate channel alter the substrate specificity of alkane monooxygenase (AlkB) and point to a key role for a substrate channel. Difficulties maintaining activity through purification have limited studies on this important metalloenzyme. Results presented include procedures for generating and characterizing stable cell free extracts from several different sources of AlkB, including those with mutations that alter substrate specificity. These stable cell free extracts enabled characterization of reaction mechanisms using diagnostic substrates. Three diagnostic substrates -norcarane, bicyclohexane, and bicyclopentane -were used. These substrates differ in size and rearrangement rate, facilitating a thorough characterization of reaction mechanism. Evidence for a long-lived substrate radical is very clear in all three substrates. assistance with mass spectrometry and Charlotte Lehmann for technical assistance with cell culturing and experiments.",

Contact e-mail: rod@dq.fct.unl.pt Fuscoredoxin is an unusual Fe-S protein from D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774. This protein contains two types of Fe-S clusters: a [4Fe-4S] cubane cluster and a novel one, [4Fe-2S-2O], which can attain four redox states. EPR and M\u00f6ssbauer data reported some of the magnetic and redox properties, but they are still far from being understood. We cloned the gene in an expression vector (pGEX-6P-1) and performed site-directed mutagenesis aiming to correlate the biochemical properties of the aminoacid involved in the metal center coordination with the spectroscopic data obtained for the protein, in particular the data on the iron related the atypical center. We also have made a mutant consisting in the deletion of the first 25 amino acids residues (from the N-terminal) to result in the specific loss of the [4Fe-4S], simplifying the data analysis. EPR and M\u00f6ssbauer studies are in progress to clarify the redox properties of this mutant. These studies will also be an important tool for revealing the biological function of fuscoredoxin. Myeloperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7, MPO) is involved in several pathologies, especially in atherosclerosis through its binding to LDL and lipoproteins oxidation. Attention has been focused on the development of MPO inhibitors with no success so far. Flufenamic acid (1) has been reported as an in vitro MPO inhibitor. As a substrate of MPO compound I, it prevents the formation of HOCl from the MPO/H 2 O 2 /Clsystem. It is metabolized into 5-chloro-and 5-hydroxyflufenamic acids (2 and 3). Molecular docking predicts that (1) interacts with the enzyme through aromatic stacking with the heme and electrostatic bonds with binding site residues. A series of inhibitor candidates were synthesized, based on the structure of (1) with these expected characteristics: -no or little HOCl scavenging, -enhanced interaction with the heme and/or binding site residues, -penetration into MPO when enzyme is bound to LDL. These compounds have been designed following a molecular docking analysis and included diacids (4), 4-substituted-and 5substituted derivatives (5 and 6). Evaluation of these molecules shows that MPO inhibition is not improved. Compounds 2 and 6 (X = Br) have a slightly higher inhibitory effect. However, all the new synthesized compounds and, particularly those with an additional acidic group, are weaker inhibitors of LDL oxidation. This could originate from electrostatic repulsion between the acid groups of the ligands and negatively charged LDLs or from steric hindrance.",

Contact e-mail: aelghazouani@cea.fr Oxidative stress is generated by exposure to elevated levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide. To avoid or counter the harmful effects of ROS, cells constitutively express proteins to protect themselves and repair the damages. These proteins are under negative control of specific regulators which are the central pieces of the inducible response to oxidative stress present in cells. In Bacillus subtilis the zinc protein PerR, a peroxide sensor that binds DNA in the presence of a regulatory metal Mn 2+ or Fe 2+ , mediates the adaptive response to H 2 O 2 . It has been shown that Fe 2+ or Mn 2+ is essential for DNA binding and that inactivation of PerR-Zn-Fe in the presence of H 2 O 2 proceeds via the metal catalyzed oxidation of at least 2 histidine residues that are supposed to coordinate the Fe 2+ ion. The present study reports the crystal structure of the PerR-Zn protein without its regulatory metal. Molecular modelling of the PerR-Zn structure led us to propose a potential binding site for the regulatory metal. The structural model for the active PerR protein suggests a conformational change of the protein upon metallation. Taking advantage of the PerR-Zn structure, several mutations were carried out in order to introduce tryptophan residues as fluorescent probes to monitor the dynamics of the protein. The results obtained with the PerR-Y77W mutant are described. Recent work on the PerR-DNA interaction, in order to identify the components of the highly specific recognition is also presented in light of protein-DNA cross-linking experiments and site-directed mutagenesis studies.",

However, FRET generally requires the specific attachment of at least two dyes (a donor and an acceptor) to the protein; in practice, producing pure samples with two dyes attached to specific sites has proved to be challenging. 2 In order to eliminate the need to attach two dyes to perform FRET experiments, we have chosen to study protein folding using horse cyt c in which the heme iron is replaced with Zn 2+ (Zn-cyt c) . Significantly, zinc porphyrin is an intrinsic fluorophore which can act as an acceptor of energy from a dye attached to the protein surface in FRET studies, eliminating the need to doubly label the protein and minimizing perturbation to the system. The present study examines folding probed by dyes attached to six different sites on Zn-cyt c. This study confirms that the folding of horse cyt c deviates from a two state folding model while making use of a novel fluorophore pair. 1. Dobson, C. M. Trends Biochem. Sci 1999, 24, 329- . This protein is often linked to electron transfer in biologic systems, working as an electron donor to other proteins in many different pathways, like cellular detoxification for example [1, 2] . Electron transfer studies between rubredoxin and superoxide reductases (SOR) were recently published [3] .To be able to accomplish these functions the presence of the iron atom is fundamental. However, it is possible to reconstitute Rd with different metals [4]. Our present work is focused in the mechanism of metal incorporation. Several metals, like cobalt, zinc and iron, were used in the reconstitution of Desulfovibrio gigas Rd. All the studies were preformed with overexpressed and purified protein. , in the absence of hydrogen peroxide to catalyze chlorination reactions.* We show that chlorite acts both as oxidant (mediating the oxidation of ferric enzymes to compound I) as well as one electron reductant (mediating the transformation compound I -> compound II -> ferric peroxidase) and that all rates of these reactions increase with decreasing pH. The corresponding reaction products, hypochlorite (ClO -) and chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 ), mediate the chlorination of monochlorodimedone, with ClO 2 being much more effective than hypochlorite. Enzymes of both peroxidase superfamilies (myeloperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase and catalase-peroxidase) have been investigated in their reaction with chlorite by using the sequential-mixing stopped-flow technique. Bimolecular rate constants at various pH values and a general reaction scheme are presented and discussed with respect to known reduction potentials of enzyme intermediates (compound I/ferric peroxidase, compound I/compound II, compound II/ferric peroxidase) and of the couples Characterization of the recombinant protein will be presented.

However, at physiological pH and under oxidizing conditions, the predominant form is Fe 3+ , which is highly insoluble. In the presence of O 2 , free Fe 2+ ions are extremely toxic. Ferritins are a broad superfamily of iron storage proteins present in all type of organisms. Ferritin (Ft) and bacterioferritin (Bfr) are unique in the sense that they perform dual functions of iron detoxification, by oxidizing the Fe 2+ ions in solution and iron sequestration by storing the oxidized Fe 3+ ions in its inner protein cavity in the form of ferrihydrate mineral (1,2). They are large spherical proteins composed of 24 subunits with a nanocavity of about 80 \u00c5. Bfrs are heme containing proteins with a b-type heme per dimer. A Bfr encoding gene was isolated from the Desulfovibrio vulgaris genome and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical, kinetic and spectroscopic studies on the recombinant D. vulgaris Bfr and a variant (E59A) will be presented. The binuclear metalloenzyme glycerophosphodiesterase (GpdQ) is the only enzyme known that is capable of catalysing the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds in mono-, di-and triesters. The protein binds one metal tightly and one loosely in the active site and thus activity is dependent on the concentration and identity of metals in the local environment. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) was used to probe the binding and coordination of cobalt(II) in the active site. The spectra reveal that addition of two equivalents of cobalt to the apo-enzyme gives rise to only one protein MCD transition corresponding to a six-coordinate site. Addition of a further 48 equivalents leads to a second transition, corresponding to a partially occupied 5-coordinate site. The observed transitions and coordination number were verified by angular overlap model (AOM) calculations. MCD of the phosphate inhibited species allows visualisation of the transition state involved in catalysis. Analysis of these spectra indicates that the coordination of each metal is conserved, supporting the proposal that the phosphate displaces the bridging hydroxide during the phosphorolysis. In addition, intensification of the 5-coordinate transition suggests that the phosphate aids in assembly of the catalytic centre by anchoring the loosely bound metal in the second site. Magnetisation behaviour of the cobalt ions were studied and indicates an uncoupled system with an isolated pseudo-Kramer doublet ground state in all species. Nitrile hydratase (NHase) from Rhodococcus sp. N771 is a nonheme iron enzyme having post-translationally modified cysteine ligands, Cys112-SO 2 -and Cys114-SO-. NHase is widely used for industrial production of acrylamide, but its catalytic mechanism is very limited. tert-butylisocyanide (t-BuNC) is a strong competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 5 uM. Recently, we found that NHase catalyzes the conversion of t-BuNC to tert-butylamine. Since the turnover rate for t-BuNC is much lower than that for nitriles, t-BuNC is likely to be a good substrate for studying the reaction mechanism of NHase. Here, we performed the time-resolved crystal structure analysis of NHase using t-BuNC as a substrate. t-BuNC was soaked to crystals of the nitrosylated inactive NHase. The catalytic reaction was started by photo-induced denitrosylation. At the reaction-elasped times of 0, 18, 70, 120, 340 and 440 mins, the reaction was stopped by flash-cooling of nitrogen gas and the X-ray diffraction data set were collected. At 0 min, a t-BuNC molecule was located in the reaction cavity but its -NC group was not interacted with NHase. At 70 and 120 mins, the carbon atom of the NC group in t-BuNC was coordinated to the iron at a distance of 2.07 \u00c5. Interestingly, two electron densities maps were appeared at a distance of 1.26 \u00c5 from the carbon atom of the -NC group in the 440 min complex. The structure is likely to represent the enzymereaction intermediate complex. Based on the results obtained, the catalytic mechanism of NHase will be discussed.",

In our previous study, we have reported that myoglobin reconstituted with FePc had extremely high O 2 affinity, whereas unfavorable autoxidation was remarkably slow due to the small rate constant of O 2 dissociation. The interesting behavior may be due to the decrease of the macrocyclic ligand framework. Recently, we also focused on the peroxidase and peroxygenase activities of the hemoproteins reconstituted with FePc. The H 2 O 2 -dependent oxidations of guaiacol, thioanisole and styrene catalyzed by myoglobin reconstituted with FePc gave the corresponding oxidation and/or oxygenation products with ca. 10-fold acceleration compared to the native protein. In addition, the large amounts of H 2 O 2 led to the conversion of compound II-like species of FePc into the compound III-like species, oxygenated FePc, in the myoglobin heme pocket. Furthermore, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reconstituted with FePc was also prepared by the conventional method. The peroxygenase activity of the reconstituted protein toward thioanisole oxidation was larger than that of native HRP by 10-fold. The highly oxidative intermediates, compound I and II of FePc were successively detected by stopped-flow technique. In this presentation, we will discuss the reactivity of FePc in the hemoprotein pocket. Heme-regulated eIF2 kinase (heme-regulated inhibitor [HRI]) plays a critical role in the regulation of protein synthesis by heme iron. HRI senses and mediates responses to changes in the heme concentration. However, little is known regarding how heme binds to the catalytic domain and regulates catalysis, the stoichiometry of heme binding, and which residues are axial ligands for the heme iron. From our spectroscopic studies of an N-terminal truncated mutant lacking the first 145 amino acids, it was suggested that one of the heme axial ligands should be a Cys residue located in the Cterminal catalytic domain. To determine which Cys residue is responsible for the heme binding, we generated site-directed mutants at six Cys residues. Heme binding abilities of the Cys mutants were clearly different from that of the wild-type protein.",

The structure has been solved with molecular replacement using the [3Fe-4S] ferredoxin from P. furiosus [1] as a search model. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are different. The A molecule contains a double conformation of the disulfide bond which exists in a 60 % occupancy of the left-handed and a 40 % occupancy of the right-handed spiral conformation, while molecule B has a disulfide bond only in the right-handed spiral conformation. Furthermore, the A molecules create dimers through a -sheet interaction, while the B molecules are packed as monomers in a less rigid position. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that results in death within two to five years. The homodimeric antioxidant enzyme Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been implicated in two percent of ALS cases. Over 100 mutations leading to ALS have been documented in SOD1. Our laboratory has characterized biophysically a number of these mutant proteins and found that they fall into two general classes, pseudowild type or metal-binding region mutants. We have found that many of the pseudo-wild type ALS mutations destabilize the apoprotein. Previous studies have indicated that major structural rearrangements occur upon the binding of one zinc to the wild type apo protein dimer. Here we extend our studies of the ALS mutant proteins to include the thermal stability of the zinc bound forms using differential scanning calorimetry. Surprisingly, the mutant proteins with one zinc bound have similar stability to wild type, despite their differing (lower) stability in the apo form. With two zinc ions bound, the ALS mutant proteins once again exhibit a wider range of thermal stability. Identifying causes of the differing thermal stabilities of the apo and metallated forms of the proteins will help us better understand the nature of the toxicity of the mutant proteins.",

The gold electrode was immersed into 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), and then, immersed in CEPG solution including NHS and EDC. The modified electrodes were soaked in the protein solution. The redox responses using ME-Ami and ME/CEPG-Ami electrodes were observed by cyclic voltammetry. This result suggests that Ami adsorbed nonspecifically on the ME-modified electrode. Therefore, to remove the nonspecifically absorbed Ami, Ami-immobilized electrodes were immersed in phosphate buffer containing 1 M NaCl. As a result, the redox response using the ME-Ami electrode was diminished. When the ME/CEPG-Ami electrode was used, the redox response was still observed.

Contact e-mail: k-kiyota@phs.osaka-u.ac.jp Porcine myoglobin (Mb) mutants having a ligand binding pocket in the heme proximal side was investigated by absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopic methods. Mb is an oxygen storage protein which has been the subject of intense research over the last few decades. The heme iron in wildtype (WT) Mb is coordinated to the protein through the proximal His93, and exogenous small ligands including oxygen molecule bind to the distal iron coordination site. We focused on a quadruple mutant, H64V/V68H/H93A/H97F (VHAF), which uniquely has an endogenous distal His68 ligand and a binding pocket for an exogenous ligand in the iron proximal side 1) . In order to make the proximal pocket for exogenous ligands to access easily, we further constructed a quadruple mutant, H64V/V68H/H93A/H97A (VHAA), in which the proximal Phe97 in VHAF is replaced by less bulky Ala. Stability of the bound heme, pH dependence, and ligand (CN -, CO) affinity to VHAA were studied using UV-vis absorption technique, and the heme structure as well as its environment was investigated by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The VHAA mutant was revealed to be a six-coordinate high-spin species in the ferric state and five-coordinate high-spin species in the ferrous state. The Fe-CO stretching frequency of VHAA was higher than that of VHAF, suggesting more polar proximal environment similar to that in WT Mb. The pH dependence of VHAA, however, differed substantially from that of WT. Thus, VHAA was revealed to have a unique binding pocket for exogenous ligands. Homogeneous AKs with the ratio metal/protein equal 1/1 (where metals were Co 2+ , Zn 2+ , Fe 2+ ) were obtained. Apo-AK was obtained in vivo conditions in inclusion bodies by following refolding in presence of detergent NDSB256 as well as in vitro conditions using phenylmercurihydroxyde as substituted agent and DTT and TCEP as reducing agents. Metal chelated and apo-AK forms were spectroscopically (UV/Visible, EPR) and kinetically characterized and compared. For metal containing forms V max for ADP and MgADP can be represented in following order Zn-AK > Co-AK = Fe-AK. In the same time K M values for MgADP for all metal chelated forms are the same but K M values for ADP are vary (Co-AK > Zn-AK > Fe-AK). The kinetic properties of apo-AK are different with comparison to metal chelated forms. Thus specific activity of it is only 20% from metal chelated forms.This work was supported by POCI/QUI ). A part of our effort to elucidate details of the catalytic mechanisms of molybdoenzymes, particularly that of SO, includes the study of well-defined model complexes that can provide a means of interpreting specific spectroscopic features of enzymes and their proposed reaction intermediates. The coordination of chloride ( 35,37 Cl, I = 3/2) to Mo(V) in the low pH form of SO, for example, has been proposed based on indirect EPR and X-ray absorption evidence, and chloride coordination has also been invoked to explain some of the recurring features in the electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectra of SO. However, the unambiguous identification of this ligand and a complete description of its interaction with Mo in the SO active site have remained elusive. Here, the ESEEM of oxomolybdenum(V) complexes that have chlorine nuclei in either the first or second coordination sphere will be presented. The ESEEM of 17 O (I = 5/2) labeled Mo(V) oxo/hydroxo complexes will also be presented, allowing benchmark hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole interaction parameters for Mo= 17 O and Mo-17 OH species to be determined and compared to similarly labeled SO. Finally, using 17 O-NMR, model studies relevant to the mechanism of oxygen atom transfer in the fully oxidized Mo(VI)O 2 SO state will be discussed. The biological insertion of Fe-S involves the interaction of (metallo) chaperons with a partly folded target polypeptide. In this respect, the study of non-native protein conformations in iron-sulfur proteins is relevant for the understanding of the folding process and cofactor assembly [1-6]. We have investigated the formation of a molten globule state in a prokaryotic [3Fe4S][4Fe4S] ferredoxin which also contains a structural Zn 2+ centre [6] . Biophysical studies have allowed to dissect the sequence of thermal unfolding events: Fe-S disassembly, loss of tertiary contacts and dissociation of the Zn 2+ site which is simultaneous to alterations on the secondary structure. Upon cooling, an apo-ferredoxin state is obtained, with characteristics of a molten globule: compactness identical to the native form; similar secondary structure evidenced by far-UV CD; no near-UV CD detected tertiary contacts; and an exposure of the hydrophobic surface [6]. Diketone cleaving enzyme (Dke1) from Acinetobacter johnsonii is a non-heme iron dependent dioxygenase that degrades its natural substrate acetylacetone by oxygenative C-C bond cleavage. The metal binding site of this enzyme is similar to other dioxygenases that show a cupin fold and consists of three histidine-residues. Since the majority of analogous non-heme metal-dependent dioxygenases possess a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad we performed mutagenesis experiments to replace the first-coordination sphere histidine residues by carboxylate and carboxylamine residues to investigate the effects on activity and metal binding. Microdialysis equilibrium experiments combined with fluorescence titrations showed the removal of a high affinity iron binding site in Dke1, consistent with the loss of diketone-cleaving activity. A second, low-affinity, iron binding site was identified that is not relevant for catalysis. In contrast, the other divalent ions that were tested in terms of binding -Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ -only showed minor effects upon exchange of the first coordination sphere residues. We therefore found that by disrupting the 3-histidine coordination motif in Dke1 we could selectively lower the enzymes affinity for Fe2+.",

Blindauer, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom. Contact e-mail: o.leszczyszyn@warwick.ac.uk Gene mining and expression studies have shown that plant metallothionein-like proteins display significant variation in sequence and biological function. However, information about their biochemical properties, metal-binding interactions and solution structure is considerably underrepresented in metallothionein research. 1 We present a comprehensive characterisation of one plant MT exclusively expressed in the embryos of pre-germinating wheat seeds (E C ). 2 Unlike other metallothioneins, the CXC motifs of E C are arranged into three regions along the primary sequence, and as such the E C sequence cannot be aligned with those of mammalian origin. In addition, E C has two histidine residues, which are not present in mammalian metallothioneins, but have been shown to coordinate metal ions in bacterial metallothioneins. 3 It is therefore not surprising that the solution properties and structure differ from previously characterised metallothioneins. Using various multinuclear and multidimensional NMR experiments, we demonstrate the involvement of histidine residues in zinc ion coordination and their likely modes of binding, together with analysis of backbone dynamics and support for a novel cluster composition. 111 Cd NMR and [ 1 H, 1 H] TOCSY spectra reveal interesting exchange behaviour in one of the clusters and also offer structural insights. 1 O.I. Leszczyszyn, R. Schmid, C.A. Blindauer, 2007, Proteins: Struct., Func., Bioinf., Accepted manuscript SHP (Sphaeroides Heme Protein) is an oxygen-binding cytochrome, typically found in photosynthetic and metal-reducing bacteria. Like other oxygen-binding cytochromes, it not only binds oxygen but also nitric oxide, with similar \"on-rates\". SHP is found in 16 different species of bacteria and, exceptionally, is the only known ctype cytochrome to have asparagine as a heme ligand. The 3dimensional structure of SHP was solved in 2000 [1] . The redox partner for SHP is thought to be another cytochrome known as DHC (DiHeme Cytochrome c) [2] . In previous studies, we have shown that DHC transfers electrons efficiently to SHP. DHC also binds tightly to SHP under low ionic strength conditions. However, the biological function of SHP is not clear. An investigation of the Integrated Microbial Genomes data base revealed that the genes for SHP/DHC/Cyt b are side by side in a gene neighbourhood, and their mRNAs are up-regulated when nitrite is the electron acceptor. Using biochemical methods, we have demonstrated that the oxyferrous form of SHP can react rapidly with nitric oxide to form nitrate. Therefore, we propose that one function for SHP is as a nitric oxide dioxygenase. The Heat-Shock Protein A (HspA) is a member of GroES chaperonin family, and it consists of 118 amino acids with a unique histidine/cystein-rich C-terminus, which is completely absent from most other GroES members. When being introduced into Escherichia coli with urease gene cluster together, HspA has been observed to be able to increase urease activity greatly [1] , indicating that the protein may play an important role for the process of nickel transportation. Histidine-rich proteins are known for their abilities to bind to nickel [2, 3] although their biological functions are not well understood.",

The aggregation behavior was studied via gel filtration chromatography. The metal binding properties of both HspA and its C-termini histidine/cystein rich peptide were examined using UV-vis spectroscopy and the results showed that HspA binds to nickel and bismuth with a stoichiometry of 2:1, similar to that of nickel binding to the peptide. Binding of both Ni 2+ and Bi 3+ to the protein is reversible and can be released either by chelate ligands such as EDTA or by lowing pH. Tyrosinase holds great potential for the bioremediation of phenols in wastewater, since it reacts with such compound to form minimally soluble pigments that can be removed readily. It is unique in being capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation and subsequent oxidation of phenols using only O 2 and substrate without additional reducing equivalents or co-substrates. We have developed an expression system for Streptomyces gluacescens tyrosinase that produces enzyme that is active in vivo in high yield, and have designed a strategy for the directed evolution of tyrosinase mutants with improved activities towards non-native phenol substrates. This approached yielded a series of mutants of tyrosinase with improved activity towards chlorinated phenols, specifically 4-chlorophenol. The first round of directed evolution yielded 25 mutants that were 50-150% more active towards 4chlorophenol. A second round of directed evolution yielded two double-mutants with an approximately 5-fold increase in k cat towards 4-chlorophenol. Detailed steady-state kinetic studies also showed modest improvements in k cat towards other chlorophenols, and decreased activity towards methylphenols. The mutations identified are mostly in the second-coordination sphere, and provide an interesting basis for future studies of structure-function correlations in this enzyme.",

Contact e-mail: ornella.maglio@unina.it A major objective in protein science is the design of novel enzymes with properties tailored to specific applications. This goal is becoming increasingly possible: the growing number of protein sequences and known three-dimensional structures are providing essential information, which contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function. In this perspective, metalloprotein design provides a powerful approach, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the way metalloproteins function in biology, with the ultimate goal of developing novel biocatalysts and sensing devices 1 . We approached the challenge of reproducing metalloprotein activesites through the de novo protein-design. We centered our attention on iron-containing proteins, and we developed the DF (Due Ferri) family of artificial proteins, as models of di-iron proteins 2 . A first subset of the DF family, DF1, consisted of two noncovalently associated helix-loop-helix motifs, which bound the dimetal cofactor near the center of the structure. DF1 analogues showed limited solubility in aqueous solution, probably due to an inter-helical turn with strained conformation, and an active site relatively inaccessible. To enhance the properties of this subset, we refined the structure by designing a new symmetric helix-loop-helix dimer, DF3. DF3 contains changes into the sequence to improve metal ion access, and a new inter-helical loop. It shows improved solubility and active site accessibility, while retaining the unique native-like structure. The role of the Thr101 residue in the conformational property and the stability of the active site of cytochrome P450cam were studied using site-directed mutagenesis and multi-wavelength circular dichroism (CD) techniques. The T101V mutation did not change the substrate binding affinity of the enzyme but it was associated with subtle changes in the conformational anisotropy around the heme active site. Thermostability of the mutant and the wild type enzyme have been studied by temperature dependence of the far-UV CD as well as that of the visible CD bands that arise from the heme moiety along with differential scanning calorimetry. The analysis of the thermal unfolding data showed that the thermal stability of the secondary structure of the enzyme was unaffected by the mutation. But the mutation was found to decrease the thermostability of the active site in presence of the substrate. On the other hand, this mutation had no apparent effect on the thermostability of the substrate-free enzyme. These results suggested that the threonine residue stabilizes the heme centre in case of the substrate-bound species, possibly by hydrogen bonding with one of the hemepropionate side chains. Such hydrogen bonding of the hemepropionate with threonine is absent in the substrate-free enzyme.",

            "text": "Nitric Oxide Reductase (NOR) from Pseudomonas (Ps.) nautica 617 is a membrane bound enzyme which belongs to the cNOR class. The as-isolated form is a heterodimer with a ~17 kDa (NORC) and a ~54 kDa (NORB) subunits. While NORC is a c-type monohemic subunit, NORB contains two b-type hemes and a nonheme iron atom. The protein can be stabilized in three different redox forms: the asisolated, ascorbate reduced and dithionite reduced, that exhibit different spectroscopic and kinetic behavior. The application of an array of spectroscopic (UV/Visible, EPR and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopies) in conjugation with visible stopped-flow and electrochemistry to the study of the different redox forms, allowed the identification of the active form. Cytochrome c 552 from the same organism was, also, identified as the putative physiologic electron donor in the nitric oxide reduction reaction catalyzed by NOR. Data will be shown on the bifunctionallity of Ps. nautica NOR, capable of NO reduction, as well as O 2 reduction. Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes catabolism of heme to biliverdin, CO and a free iron through three successive oxygenation steps. The third oxygenation, ring opening of verdoheme to yield biliverdin, has been the least understood step in spite of its importance in regulating the HO activity. In this study, we have performed reactions of a verdoheme-HO complex with alkyl hydroperoxides to assess three possible pathways previously proposed for the verdoheme opening (Fig.) . The reaction with ethyl hydroperoxide, but not t-butyl and cumyl hydroperoxides, under reducing conditions afforded two linear tetrapyrroles without forming significant amount of biliverdin. The new products could also be prepared by chemical opening of verdoheme with sodium ethoxide, and were identified by HPLC and ESI-MS analysis as 1-ethoxy-and 19-ethoxy-deoxybiliverdins. The formation of the ethoxybiliverdins unambiguously identifies the Fe-OOR species as a key intermediate in the EtOOH reaction, and strongly suggests the corresponding Fe-OOH mechanism for the physiologically relevant O 2 -and H 2 O 2 -dependent biliverdin production. This is similar to the well-established mechanism of the first oxygenation, mesohydroxylation of heme. HO appears to be evolved to control the reactivity of the Fe-OOH complexes to allow addition of their terminal oxygen moieties to the porphyrin macrocycle.",

The enzymes mainly catalyze the monooxygenation of a variety of hydrophobic substrates. We reported overexpression and purification of cytochrome P450 from a thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon, Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7 (P450st), previously. 1 It has been reported that the electronic environment around the heme group moiety and proximal heme ligand, Cys, affects the redox potential of cytochrome P450s. 2 In this study, we have constructed the P450st mutants substituted Phe310 to Ala and Ala320 to Gln, respectively. The double-point mutant changed at both F310A and A320Q has also been constructed. Phe310 and Ala320 in P450st reside closely at the conserved cysteine ligand, Cys317 in P450st, which coordinates to heme iron (Fig. 1) . We have been investigated the effects of the substitutes on the electrochemical properties and thermostability. The reduction potential and the catalytic activity with shunt pathway of P450st and mutants have also been investigated. One-and two-dimensional Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) experiments have been used to study the coordination chemistry at the Fe(II) site of two non-heme Fe(II) Hydroxylases, taurine/2-ketoglutarate (2KG) dioxygenase (TauD) and xanthine hydroxylase (XanA). For both systems, Fe(II)-NO derivatives of the enzymes were studied. The 4-pulse HYSCORE method was used to resolve contributions from bound histidine nitrogens, coordinated H2O, and ambient H2O. For TauD, HYSCORE spectra collected for samples in aqueous buffer and 60% D2O-buffer showed changes in H2O and histidyl coordination as co-substrates, 2KG and taurine, were added to the enzyme. Prior to co-substrate addition, HYSCORE spectra show a substantial distribution of exchangeable, 1H hyperfine couplings. When 2KG is added, the 1H HYSCORE is considerably altered with the dominant hyperfine coupling arising from an exchangeable, strong-coupled proton of rhombic symmetry. Subsequent addition of substrate taurine to yield the ternary, Fe(II)-NO/2KG/taurine, complex at the active site showed a new, 1H hyperfine interaction that was not exchangeable in D2O. The HYSCORE cross-peaks from this 1H show a hyperfine tensor of axial symmetry characterized by a dipole-dipole distance of 3.2A and an isotropic contribution of 1.1 MHz. Comparison of these data with the X-ray crystal structure of TauD and the results of parallel studies of TauD variants, may provide important information on how active site protein residues work in concert with the Fe(II) center to catalyze the specific hydroxylation of taurine. Parallel studies on XanA will be presented and the results compared to our findings for TauD.",

Two subunits form a minimal structural unit; in one subunit, Cys 122 , Cys 124 , and Cys 132 near a catalytic sites coordinate a proximal zinc ion, which is catalytically essential, and in the other subunit, Cys 223 at the orifice of the active center coordinates a reservoir distal zinc ion. We elucidated that, in enzymatic activation by 2-mercaptoethanol, the distal zinc ion was transferred, and bound to the proximal bindingsite (1). In this study, analytical ultracentrifugation, negative staining electron microscopy, and native PAGE were performed to determine the oligomeric state of PBGS under physiologic conditions. Furthermore enzyme activity staining and enzyme kinetic study were also carried out to investigate the structural change in enzymatic activation. It is concluded that PBGS exists in octamer under physiological conditions, and that the metamorphosis of the four sets of dimer units, resulting from the decrease in the Stokes radius of the oligomer, occurs in enzymatic activation. Metal-and redox-regulated metamorphosis of the oligomer is an essential process for PBGS activation. Iron-sulfur proteins are found in virtually all life forms including archaebacteria, eubacteria, plants, and animals, and play various important physiological roles in electron transport, enzyme reactions, gene regulation, and DNA/RNA metabolisms. While a number of factors involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis in bacteria and in yeast have been identified and characterized extensively, molecular mechanism of iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and delivery in the plant cell still remains poorly understood. In Arabidopsis thaliana, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthetic machineries have shown to be present both in the mitochondrion and in the chloroplast. In the chloroplast, two essential factors have already been identified as important participants, namely CnfU and Hcf101. Previously we identified and characterized the chloroplastlocalized iron-sulfur cluster biosynthetic scaffold named CnfU whose function is essential for biogenesis of ferredoxin and photosystem I in Arabidopsis. We have now determined the crystal structure of CnfU and also gained the precise Fe-S cluster structure assembled on this scaffold protein in order to elucidate detailed molecular mechanisms of CnfU-involved Fe-S cluster assembly and delivery. Moreover, we have been characterizing several additional Arabidopsis proteins which are likely involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis in the chloroplast or outside the chloroplast, the cytosol. We are now studying their detailed in vivo functions by analyzing Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants and by using yeast complementation assay. Biochemical characterization of respective recombinant proteins purified from E.coli cells is also underway.",

The NAD-or NADP-dependent ADH can be divided into three groups according to their structures. Group I is a zinc-dependent, long-chain ADH family. Group II is a zinc-independent short-chain ADH. Group III is an iron-activated ADHs. The iron-activated ADHs have been little studied due to their structural instability. In this study, we have constructed the overexpression system of iron containing ADH derived from hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhADH) with Escherichia coli. The catalytic activity and thermostability of PhADH have been investigated. PhADH gene was amplified by PCR using P. horikoshii OT3 genomic DNA. The gene subcloned into the pET23d was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in LB medium containing ampicillin and FeSO 4 . After centrifugation and sonication, the supernatant was heated to 80 \u00b0C for 30 min. Objective protein was isolated via cation-exchange, hydrophobic, and gel filtration chromatographies. The purified recombinant enzyme migrated as a single band with apparent molecular mass about 43 kDa on SDS-PAGE, in good agreement with that deduced from the gene sequence The substrate specificity of PhADH in the oxidation reaction was analyzed using a range of primary alcohols. As a result, the highest catalytic activity of PhADH using 1-butanol and NAD + as a cofactor was obtained. The catalytic activity of PhADH was maintained after pre-incubation at 90 \u00b0C.",

The active site of NiSOD contains the nickel ion with the equatorial plane of monoaminemonoamide-dithiolate type coordination, and such a planar N2S2 coordination geometry is necessary for the most suitable redox reaction of superoxide-dismutation. The crystal structural analysis of NiSOD has showed that the central nickel ion is changed from the square-planar Ni(II) to square pyramidal Ni(III) by coordination of axial imidazole of His1. In this study, we focused on the axial coordination behavior in NiSOD, so three types of Ni(II) complexes with N2S2 squareplanar coordinations (Figure) as active site models of NiSOD were synthesized. Addition of imidazoles to the acetone solution of Ni(II) complexes, 1 and 2, showed absorption spectral changes due to their axial coordination, but, in the case of Ni(II) complex 3, no spectral changes were observed under the same condition. EPR studies of an oxidized Ni (III) complex of 3 revealed that an imidazole molecule bound to the axial position of the Ni(III) center, judging from the appearance of hyperfine-splitting of its axially coordinating nitrogen atom in the parallel region. Based on these spectroscopic analysis data of these model systems, we will discuss about relationships between the axial coordination behaviors and electrochemical properties of the nickel center of NiSOD.",

The two-domain mammalian protein binds divalent metals (M) into two metal-thiolate clusters with stoichiometries of M 3 S cys9 ( ) and M 4 S cys11 ( ).

            "text": "HemAT is a heme-containing signal transducer protein that functions as an O 2 sensor in aerotaxis control system in some bacteria and archaea. HemAT should discriminate its physiological effecter O 2 from other gas molecules, for which the specific interaction between the heme-bound ligands and the surrounding amino acid residues play an important role. Resonance Raman spectroscopy and mutagenesis studies reveal that HemAT from Bacillus subtilis (HemAT-Bs) has three conformers in O 2 -bound form with different hydrogen bonding pattern on the O 2 , where Thr95 is involved in the hydrogen bonding interaction. Recently, it is reported that HemAT homologues exist in some bacteria. In some HemAT homologues, Thr residue is not conserved at the corresponding position to Thr95 in HemAT-Bs in the distal heme pocket. This suggests that the hydrogen bonding interaction between Thr residue and the heme bound O 2 is not a mandatory requirement for the selective O 2 sensing mechanism. Essential factors for O 2 sensing by HemAT would be clarified by comparing the detail properties including the hydrogen bonding pattern on the heme-bound ligand among HemAT homologues. In this study, we characterized the hydrogen bonding pattern on the heme-bound O 2 in HemAT from Halobacterium salinarum (HemAT-Hs) and Rhodospirillum rubrum (HemAT-Rr) by using resonance Raman spectroscopy. O 2 -bound HemAT-Hs and HemAT-Rr have three conformers but the hydrogen-bonding pattern in the distal heme pocket is different from HemAT-Bs. Based on these results, we will discuss the essential factors for the selective O 2 sensing by HemAT Reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxide are toxic compounds leading to cell damage or death. Peroxidases reduce peroxide to H 2 O using a variety of oxidisable substrates, small mono haem c type cytochromes and/or copper proteins, like pseudoazurin [1,2]. As to the catalytic mechanism, with the exception of Nitrosomonas europaea, all bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases (CCP) are isolated in a resting state. The high potential haem needs to be reduced by one electron to allow the conversion from resting to active protein, triggering the loss of one of the coordinants from the low potential haem allowing the hydrogen peroxide to bind. We report on the direct electrochemistry of Paracoccus pantotrophus CCP in non turnover and catalytic conditions at a pyrolytic graphite membrane electrode. The results show that the enzymatic activity is mediated and limited by the structural and spin state changes, following the electron transferring haem reduction. The estimated turnover number is in clear agreement with the rate constant determined for the rate limiting step. Incorporation of metallocenes into biological molecules has attracted the attention of several researchers. Thus, steroids, penicillin antibiotics, and saccharides have been functionalized with metallocenes. The rationale to prepare such bioconjugates lies in the increased lipophilicity brought by the metallocene structure and the use of the covalently bound metal-label for sensing applications. Despite many advances in peptide chemistry and the synthesis of peptide-metallocene bioconjugates, cymantrene derivatives have received relatively little attention so far. In this work, the neuropeptide pseudoneurotensin H-Lys-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH, a 99mTc-labelled analogue of which shows enhanced tumor uptake, was chosen to be part of metal-peptide bioconjugates. We report on the microwave-assisted solid phase conjugation between cymantrene carboxylic acid and the biologically active neuropeptide part (Scheme). Microwave irradiation was applied at different stages of the synthesis, including amide bond formation, removal of Fmoc protective groups, and acidolytic release of the metal-bioconjugate from the resin. The use of microwave irradiation in all steps of the solid-phase peptide synthesis and for coupling of cymantrene allows to significantly reduce reaction times while leading to high purity of the crude product. The resulting metal-peptide bioconjugate (1) was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized with ESI mass spectrometry. Additionally, the biological activity of this new cymantrene-peptide will be reported.

Contact e-mail: peroza@aci.unizh.ch Metallothioneins (MTs) are small proteins found in a wide range of living organisms with a characteristic high cysteine content and affinity for d 10 metals ions. There is evidence supporting their participation in the homeostasis of essential metal ions, e.g. Zn II and Cu I , sequestration of toxic elements (Cd II or Hg II ) and in the protection against oxidative damage. Additionally, the mobility of metabolic zinc has been linked to the cellular redox state and thus also to the redox state of MTs [1]. The early cysteine-labelled protein (E c -1) from wheat is a member of the plant MT pec sub-family and was the first MT identified in higher plants [2] . In our past work we showed that wheat E c -1 binds up to 6 Zn II or Cd II ions. These metal ions are most likely arranged in two separate metal clusters, one binding four metal ions ( -E c -1) and another binding two ( -E c -1) [3] . In our contribution we will present a more detailed view of the metal cluster characteristics. Rhodothermus marinus is a thermohalophic bacterium, whose respiratory chain has been extensively studied. The biochemical, spectroscopic and genetic search for a bc 1 complex was always fruitless; however a functional equivalent complex was purified from the membranes and characterized 1 . Now, with the sequencing of R. marinus genome it was possible to assign the N-terminal sequences from several proteins of this complex to its coding genes. It was observed that the bc complex has the same genomic organisation of the so called MFIcc complexes 2 , which have been proposed to be oxidoreductases participating in the respiratory and in the photosynthetic electron transfer chains. Furthermore it was observed the presence of this complex in several genomes in which the genes coding for the bc 1 complex are absent and in which a quinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase has to be present. R. marinus bc complex is coded by a six gene cluster. Three of these genes codify for peripheral proteins; two cytochromes c, a pentahaemic and a monohaemic, and a large protein containing iron sulphur centres. The other three genes code for transmembrane proteins: two are predicted to have ten transmembrane helices with putative quinone binding sites motifs and are homologous to membrane subunits present in several members of the DMSO reductase family; the third gene codifies a two transmembrane helices protein. Despite numerous studies, the molecular mechanism of cadmium (Cd) toxicity in cells is not totally understood. Our aim is to detect protein targets of Cd at low Cd doses (10 \u03bcM) to unravel some aspects of cadmium toxicity. Although Cd-protein interactions have been evidenced in vitro, only few data are available concerning these interactions in vivo, at low Cd doses. To identify Cd protein targets in vivo, cells were grown in the presence of radiolabeled 109 Cd. Two successive native electrophoreses were performed to separate solubles proteins of the cell extract. This method preserves metal-protein interactions established in vivo. Autoradiography revealed fourteen soluble protein targets for cells cultured in the presence of 10 \u03bcM Cd. Proteins were then identified using mass spectrometry. Mutants deleted for some these proteins were constructed which confirmed the identified protein targets. Overexpression of some of the target proteins confirmed their role in Cd-binding in the cellular context. This work validates our new global approach for protein metal targets identification. Analysis of the consequence of Cd binding on the proteins structure and function has been initiated. In particular, Cd substitution of endogenous metals (Fe/Zn) is being analyzed using FTIR difference spectroscopy (see poster by L. Guilloreau et al.).",

Barr The heme-scavenging plasma protein hemopexin (Hx) binds a variety of divalent metal ions 1 and may, therefore, participate in metal ion homeostasis in vivo. Recently, we used homology modeling to propose a structure for human Hx based on the structure reported for rabbit Hx, and we identified several putative metal ion binding sites. 2 Here, we use thermally-induced near-UV difference spectroscopy to study human Hx lacking bound heme (the form normally in circulation) in the presence and absence of bound metal ions. The results are interpreted in light of the metal ion binding sites proposed in our model. 2 We also consider the effects of increasing temperature and metal ion binding on the far-UV CD spectrum of Hx and find that Zn 2+ and Cu 2+ influence the tertiary structure of the protein the most by reducing the T m by 4 and 5 \u00b0C, respectively. Because these metal ions also destabilize the structure of the Hx-heme complex, 3 Cytochrome c (Cyt c) is a key electron mediator between Cytochrome bc 1 complex and Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO) in the respiratory chain. To properly transfer electrons from Cyt c to CcO for the oxygen reduction in CcO, the specific and effective electron transfer mechanism is required. The detailed mechanism is, however, still unclear due to lack of the structural characterization of the electron transfer complex between Cyt c and CcO. In this study, 1 H-15 N HSQC NMR spectra of ferrous and ferric 15 N-labeled Cyt c were measured in the absence and presence of unlabeled CcO to examine the CcO binding site on Cyt c. Based on the chemical shift changes and line broadening of the NMR signals, we successfully determined that the CcO binding site is located near heme vinyl group and showed the possibility that, in addition to electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions are also involved in the specific binding with CcO. Upon oxidation of ferrous Cyt c to ferric Cyt c, the signal perturbation by binding CcO is reduced for some NMR signals from polar residues such as Glu4 and Lys8, suggesting that the electrostatic interactions with CcO would be weakened to facilitate the replacement of ferric Cyt c with ferrous Cyt c. Thus, our NMR analysis for the Cyt c-CcO complex clearly identified the CcO binding site on Cyt c and we can propose a mechanism for the redox-dependent affinity change of Cyt c to CcO, leading to the specific and effective electron transfer between Cyt c and CcO. Inhibitors of Zinc-containing enzymes, including Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and some tumor-associated Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) isoenzymes are attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of numerous diseases. Therefore their inhibition is supposed to slow down or prevent disease progression. The inhibition of each of these enzymes needs special structural requirements, not only in corresponding zinc-binding groups but also in the different scaffolds to assure strong interaction within the cofactor-binding region of the enzymes. A series of new compounds, based on iminodiacetic (IDA) scaffolds with different sets of alkylaryl and sulfonylaryl groups as well as two types of zinc binding groups, namely hydroxamate and primary sulfonamides have been designed, developed and tested in vitro, with the aim of improving potency and selectivity for the inhibition of some tumor-associated MMPs and some CA isoenzymes. These non-peptidic compounds were easily prepared, mostly from IDA, and they were assayed as inhibitors of seven MMPs (MMP1, MMP2, MMP7-9, MMP14, and MMP16 and three CAs (hCA I, II and IX). Some of the compounds show excellent specificity for the CA IX as well as MMP2, MMP9 and MMP13 with IC 50 values in nanomolar order.",

Despite low overall sequence homology between kingdoms structural conservation in their active sites is observed. The seven metal-coordinating residues are invariant. The precise details of the catalytic mechanism employed by PAPs remains subject to debate. 1 Here, we investigate the mode of substrate binding in pig PAP (uteroferrin) using stopped-flow spectroscopy, and we demonstrate, for the first time, that PAPs are also effective diesterases. Specifically, interactions between the leaving group and residues in the second coordination sphere are essential for the rapid and efficient binding of the substrate to both metal ions in the active site. Furthermore, using a diester substrate we demonstrate that PAP sequentially hydrolyses both ester bonds without releasing the initially formed monoester. The most likely mechanism is initial attack by a terminal Fe(III)-bound hydroxide and then a metalbridging hydroxide as nucleophile. A similar mechanism has also been proposed for the [L( Hemocyanin and tyrosinase are the members of type-3 copper proteins, which involve a common side-on peroxo species at their dinuclear copper reaction center (Chart 1). Despite having the same side-on peroxo dicopper(II) complex, these copper proteins exhibit different chemical reactivity toward external substrates. Namely, tyrosinase catalyzes the o-hydroxylation of phenols to catechols (phenolase activity) as well as the oxidation of catechols to oquinones (catecholase activity). In contrast, hemocyanin has essentially no redox reactivity toward external substrates, but exhibits only reversible dioxygen binding ability. We have recently found that octopus hemocyanin exhibits efficient monooxygenase activity (phenolase activity) when it is treated with 8 M urea (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 6788-6789) . In order to get more detailed insight into the monooxygenase activity of octopus hemocyanin, we herein examined the reactivity of the minimal functional unit, containing a single dicopper active site, existed at the C-terminal domain of the large subunit (~350 kDa). The expected minimal functional unit with 47 kDa molecular weight was obtained by the treatment of native octopus hemocyanin with V8-protease and following column chromatographic treatments using Sephacryl S-100 HR.

Cyt c' showed a well defined quasi-reversible faradaic response at a 6-mercaptopurin/Au electrode, and the redox potential of cyt c' was evaluated to be 184 mV [1]. The pH and ionic strength dependency of the structure and properties of cyt c' has been reported. UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopic measurements of cyt c' (ex. at 244 nm) were performed to elucidate the pH and ionic strength effect on the structural transition of cyt c'. Most of prominent Raman bands are readily assigned based on the previous paper [2] . The Raman bands at 1621 (Y8a), 1208 (Y7a), and 1175 (Y9a) cm-1 are contributed from tyrosine residues, and the Raman bands at 1551(W3) and 1343/1358(W7; Fermi doublet) cm-1 are contributed from tryptophan residues [3] . UVRR spectra of cyt c' at different pH values indicated that the environment of tryptophan residues was affected by pH. The effect of ionic strength on the UVRR of cyt c' will be reported and discussed.

Contact e-mail: osami@mbox.chem.nagoya-u.ac.jp Cytochrome P450 BS (P450 BS ) isolated from Bacillus subtilis utilizes hydrogen peroxide to catalyze exclusively the hydroxylation of long alkyl-chain fatty acid such as myristic acid. The X-ray crystal structure shows that the interaction of the terminal carboxyl group of the fatty acid with Arg 242 located nearby the heme is indispensable for the generation of the active species. Owing to this unique catalytic mechanism, P450 BS never oxidizes substrates except for the natural substrate. However, the substrate specificity of P450 BS was altered drastically by the misrecognition of the substrate induced by a decoy molecule having the structural similarity to that of the natural substrate such as heptanoic acid. In the presence of the decoy molecule, P450 BS started to catalyze oxidation reactions of non natural substrates including hydroxylation of ethylbenzene (Scheme 1). 1 The X-ray crystal structure of P450 BS including heptanoic acid showed that heptanoic acid are located in the heme pocket with the interaction between its carboxyl group and Arg 242 similarly to the natural substrate and it keeps the substrate access channel open for the access of nonnatural substrates. Bilophila wadsworthia is a Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the human gut microbial ecosystem. This bacterium is isolated from a variety of pathogenic infections, being the third most common anaerobe present in patients with perforated and gangrenous appendicitis. Although related to Desulfovibrio organisms, which are sulfate reducers, it has a particular metabolism adapted to the human body since it uses taurine, an organosulfonate that is one of the major solutes in mammals. Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough is an environmental bacterium that is a model organism for sulfate reducers. Its genome, which was recently sequenced, codes for several hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases, which are enzymes that play an important role in Desulfovibrio energy metabolism. Since Bilophila wadsworthia is a pathogen whose physiology is still poorly understood, we performed a comparative activity study of these enzymes in both organisms to achieve a better understanding of the energy metabolism of B. wadsworthia.",

Ferritin, an essential protein in humans, plants, bacteria, and other animals, is able to concentrate large amounts of iron as hydrated ferric oxides for iron-protein synthesis and minimize free radical generation with dioxygen/peroxide. Relatively little is known about the electronic and geometric structure of the biferrous oxidase sites that form ferric mineral precursors in maxi-ferritins, 24 subunit protein nanocages, or mini-ferritins (Dps, DNA protection during starvation, proteins), 12-subunit protein nanocages. Maxi-ferritin ferroxidase site ligands for bi-iron substrates are A: E, ExxH; B: E, QxxD/S/A (Liu and Theil, PNAS 101: 8557, 2004). We have studied the ferroxidase sites of frog m-ferritin (mFr) maxi-ferritin and paired Bacilli, Dps 1 and 2 mini-ferritins, with a combination of circular dichroism (CD), magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and variable-temperature, variable-field MCD (VTVH MCD) to probe Fe (II) binding to the active sites, as well as their excited and ground states reflecting their coordination environment and bridging ligation. CD spectra of the paired Bacilli Dps mini-ferritins indicate similar protein environments, however large differences in the MCD and VTVH MCD show changes in the geometry and ground states of the maxi versus mini ferritin ferroxidase sites. Oxidant preferences in maxi-and mini-ferritins also differ: dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The well-characterized intermediate, diferric peroxo, of maxi-ferritins appeared to form anerobically in mini-ferritin Dps 2 (Liu et al, JBC, 281: 27827,  2006) , although the putative iron ligands are very different. These data provide new insight into the structure/reactivity of di-iron oxidase sites and formation of ferric mineral precursors. During this past decade, heme-based sensor proteins have been discovered in all kingdoms of life at a very fast pace. These sensors usually bind O 2 , CO and NO while engaging in signal transduction with one of these gases. FixL was the first heme-based sensor discovered and represents a paradigm. Symbiotic rhizobia, upon invasion of the plant root, face much lower oxygen tensions. FixL-FixJ are responsible for sensing oxygen levels and promoting gene expression for bacterial adaptation. Similar behavior could be assumed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb entrance into latency is thought to be linked to hypoxia in the granuloma, and also, recently, to NO. Genetic and biochemical experiments have supported that the main regulator of hypoxia-induced genes of Mtb is the response regulator DevR. Two histidine kinases called DosT and DevS are responsible for DevR activation. In 2005, DevS was shown to contain heme, but there was no characterization or functional investigation of the holo protein. We have expressed and characterized full-length holo DosT and DevS proteins. DosT is also a heme containing protein. Both proteins present very similar electronic spectra but quite distinct heme properties. Kinetic experiments for binding of O 2 , CO and NO were carried out by flash-photolysis, along with K d measurements. DosT and DevS autophosphorylation reactions were clearly inhibited by O 2 while NO and CO did not alter the initial rates. Our results show DosT and DevS are oxygen sensors and explain why NO was mistakenly assumed as signal. We present our working model for this system. In mammalian peroxidases the heme is covalently attached to the protein via two ester linkages between the carboxyl groups of conserved glutamate and aspartate residues. This interaction of the protein matrix with the chromophore is responsible for the extraordinary spectral, redox and enzymatic features of these metalloproteins. In the present study, recombinant MPO and the variants Asp94Asn, Asp94Val and Glu242Gln were investigated in a comparative biophysical and biochemical study. We report the consequences of mutations on the spectral features, redox thermodynamics of the ferric/ferrous couple and inter-conversion of redox intermediates of the halogenation cycle. Disruption of the Asp ester bond had no effect on the kinetics of binding of low spin ligands (cyanide and nitrite) as well as on the formation of compound I mediated by either hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorous acid. Additionally, its impact on the reduction of compound I by iodide and thiocyanate was negligible. By contrast, rates of compound I reduction by chloride and bromide were substantially decreased compared with the wild-type protein. Disruption of the Glu ester bond significantly increased heme flexibility, blue-shifted the UV-Vis spectrum decelerated both cyanide binding and compound I formation. The apparent bimolecular rate constants at pH 7.0 of compound I reduction by chloride, bromide, iodide and thiocyanate were 500-, 25-, 21-and 63-times decreased compared with recombinant wild-type MPO. The effects of exchange of Asp94 and Glu242 on electron transfer reactions are discussed with respect to the known structures of MPO and the MPO-cyanide and MPO-halide complexes. (2) . Such cluster fragments constitute a fundamental building block of all higher nuclearity Fe-S clusters and understanding the origin of valence-delocalization is central to the understanding of biophysical properties of Fe-S clusters in general. In this work, the spectroscopic properties of the [2Fe-2S] 2+,+ center in WT and the C55S, C59S, C55S/R13E and C59S/R13E mutant forms of AaeFd4 have been studied by UV-Visible absorption, EPR, resonance Raman, and variable temperature MCD spectroscopies in an effort to understand the origin of valence delocalization. Valence delocalized species with ferromagnetically coupled S = 9/2 ground states were found to exist as minority species in frozen samples of each of the dithionitereduced AaeFd4 mutants at pH 11. However, variable temperature UV-visible absorption and MCD studies at pH 11 indicate that the mutants exclusively contain valence-delocalized [2Fe-2S] + centers with S = 9/2 ground states at room temperature and only become valence-localized with antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 ground states on freezing. The origin of valence-delocalization in [2Fe-2S] + centers will be discussed in light of these results.",

The compound I in Cytochrome P450 can catalyze alkene epoxidation and hydrocarbon hydroxylation. Interestingly, cyclohexene, which contains the C=C and allylic C-H functionalities in one molecular, is converted to cyclohexene oxide (epoxidation product) and cyclohexen-3-ol (hydroxylation product) by the compound I in cytochrome P450. It is reported that the chemoselectivity of epoxidation versus allylic hydroxylation of cyclohexene oxygenation are controlled by various factors such as reaction temperature, solvent, electronic nature and axial ligand of iron porphyrin. At present, however, it remain unclear how these factors control the chemoselectivity of cyclohexen oxygenation. In this study, we carried out that detailed kinetic analysis of C=C epoxidation and allylic C-H hydroxylation of cyclohexene. Herein, we reveal that entropy of activation, S \u2021 , is more important thermodynamic factor to control the chemoselectivity than activation energy, E a .

Our previous study suggested that the steric interaction mediated by the side chain of Leu-358 plays a key role in the propagation of the structural change from the Pdx binding site to the heme moiety, but details of this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we newly prepared a mutant, L358A, in which Ala is introduced into the position of 358 to perturb the steric interaction with heme, and examined the heme environmental structure by using the resonance Raman spectroscopy. The Fe-C stretching ( Fe-CO ) and C-O stretching ( C-O ) modes in carbonmonoxy L358A, which serve as the sensitive markers for the heme environment, were observed at 481 cm -1 and 1940 cm -1 , respectively. In addition, the binding of Pdx to L358A upshifted Fe-CO by 2 cm -1 and downshifted C-O by 8 cm -1 as found for wild type P450cam. Based on these results, we can conclude that the L358-mediated steric interaction would not be so crucial for the effector functions of Pdx, which allows us to speculate that the Pdx binding induces the conformational change of the main chain rather than the side chain of Leu358 which enables P450cam to accept electrons for the catalytic reaction.",

TDO is a homotetrameric enzyme and has a high specificity for L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and related derivatives such as 6-F-Trp. IDO is monomeric, and shows activity toward a range of substrates, including L-Trp, D-tryptophan and tryptamine. TDO and IDO have been implicated in a number of physiological conditions, including suppression of T cell proliferation and the immune escape of cancers, making them attractive targets for drug discovery. To provide insight into substrate recognition and catalysis we have solved the structure of TDO from Xanthomonus campestris, complexed with L-Trp and 6-F-Trp, to a resolution of 1.6\u00c5 and 1.9\u00c5 respectively. Both are in the catalytically active, ferrous heme state. These show that TDO is an induced-fit enzyme with significant structural changes on binding of substrate. They also define the structural basis for the stereospecificity of TDO. It is also shown that a L-Trp residue binds to an allosteric site at the interface between each monomer, offering a possible effector site for allosteric activation of TDO by L-Trp. Biochemical studies also provide direct evidence for the induced-fit behaviour -electrochemical and kinetic studies show that there is a significant stabilization of the ferrous form when substrate is bound. This stabilization could play a physiological role keeping the protein reduced, and therefore active.",

Unsaturated fat acids are obtained through a desaturation reaction, a process in which a single bond between two carbon atoms is converted in a double bond. This can be an oxygen dependent process, catalyzed by an enzyme named desaturase. From an evolutionary point of view, there are two classes of desaturases: soluble and membrane bound. Both classes are capable of 9 -desaturation of the acyl 18:0 chains, and require two electrons for each double bond formed. The presence of an iron centre in the soluble desaturases was revealed for the first time through M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. Previous studies indicate that this centre is absent in the membrane bound enzymes. A membrane bound desaturase from Arabidopsis thaliana, was cloned and overexpressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Biochemical and spectroscopic studies will be presented which establish the presence of an iron centre in this enzyme.

FprAs have no detectable amino acid sequence homology to any other class of nonheme iron proteins. Some FprAs clearly function as scavenging nitric oxide reductases (S-NORs) under anaerobic growth conditions. In vitro, however, some FprAs are reported to have dioxygen reductase (O2R) activity, either instead of or in addition to NOR activity. We are undertaking a systematic survey of these two activities, both in vivo and in vitro, of FprAs from various bacteria and archaea. Attempts to correlate the relative levels of these two activities with spectroscopic and structural differences among the FprAs will be described, as will progress in understanding the catalytic mechanisms.",

Structural analyses of sensor domain of FixL revealed the intra-domain conformational change upon oxygen binding. However, it is still unknown how the signal is transferred to the downstream domains, because no full-length structure of FixL is available. Then, we determined the crystal structure of the structural homolog of FixL/FixJ, ThkA/TrrA from hyperthermophile. The structures of sensor, dimerization, and catalytic domains and TrrA were determined at 1.6-1.9 \u00c5 resolution. The determined structures were fitted into the ThkA/TrrA complex obtained at 3.7 \u00c5 resolution. The determined structure revealed new insights as follows: (1) the interdomain interaction between sensor and catalytic domain regulates the kinase activity, (2) the ATP binding site of catalytic domain changes the conformation after the kinase reaction, and (3) the interdomain interaction between sensor and FixJ regulates the ligand affinity in the sensor domain. FixL and Dos are bacterial heme-based oxygen sensor proteins, in which binding/release of O 2 to/from the heme in a heme-binding PAS-domain leads to changes in the activity of an associated enzymatic (kinase or phosphodiesterase) domain. The structures of the PAS domains FixLH (red) and DosH (blue) have been solved and are generally similar (Figure) , but the heme coordination is markedly different: the unliganded heme is 5-coordinated in FixLH, like in myoglobin, but in DosH O 2 replaces an internal ligand (Met 95 in E. coli). Heme-ligand photodissociation can in principle be used to trigger 'switching' of the sensor and identify intermediates in the intra-protein signaling pathway. Ultrafast spectroscopic experiments indicate that unusual heme-ligand interactions are maintained after dissociation and that the heme pocket acts as an oxygen trap (1,2). With the aim of exploring the role of specific heme-ligand-residue interactions in functional motions, we have constructed mutants proteins (in particular with modified Met 95 in DosH and Arg 206 in FixLH from B. japonicum, that interacts with the propionates), and observed substantial changes in early hemeligand interactions. Interpretations are aided by molecular modeling. As one of the widely used elements in clinic for centuries, [1] the application of bismuth-based drugs was extended in medical and health purposes, e.g., anticancer, antimicrobial, and antivirus. [2, 3] SARS-CoV (SCV) was first recognized in late 2002 and its main proteinase, cysteine proteinases, NTPase/helicase and RNA polymerase have been identified as potential anti-viral targets, and have already undergone preliminary characterization. [4] Our research found that bismuth complexes exhibit effective inhibition to SCV helicase both ATPase and duplex-unwinding activities, probably due to the binding of Bi 3+ to the metal binding domain, a Cys-rich and Zn 2+ -bound region in the N-terminus of the enzyme. Our cell culture experiments also show the inhibition of Bi 3+ to SCV, revealing that Bi 3+ plays the inhibitory role during later stages of virus replicative cycle.

Contact e-mail: marcel.zamocky@boku.ac.at Catalase-peroxidases (KatGs) are bifunctional heme b containing oxidoreductases exhibiting catalase (2 H 2 O 2 ---> 2 H 2 O + O 2 ) and peroxidase activity (H 2 O 2 + 2 AH 2 --> 2 H 2 O + 2 \u2022 AH). All known catalase-peroxidases belong to class I of the superfamily of bacterial, fungal, and plant heme peroxidases. Four crystal structures of prokaryotic KatGs are known revealing several peculiar structural features. Sequence similarity searches and phylogenetic analysis of 134 eukaryotic genomes revealed the presence of 23 fungal and 3 protist katG genes that form a novel and distinct group within the abundant catalase-peroxidase protein family. Mainly in the catalytic domain their sequence similarity with bacterial KatGs is rather high but multiple sequence alignments clearly suggest differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. In phytopathogenic fungi KatGs are probably involved in hostpathogen interactions. Thus, investigations of fungal KatGs have a great practical impact for developing tools that prevent plant affection by these pathogens.Here, we focus on the cloning and heterologous expression of catalase-peroxidases from the two phytopathogenic fungi Gibberella zeae and Magnaporthe grisea both having two katG paralogs. In the case of Gibberella zeae katG1 a rare fusion of katG gene with a region coding for a cytochrome P450-like domain was detected thus forming a putative unique trifunctional multidomain heme containing oxidoreductase.

The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation by hydrogen peroxide of reductant substrates to radicals, which decompose by means of non-enzymatic reactions up to polymers. POD has great affinity towards hydrogen peroxide, thus it may be difficult to determine the value of its Michaelis constant using steady state rate assays. An alternative method consists of the use of progress curves of assays with hydrogen peroxide depletion. The analysis of the data points of a progress curve needs its complex fitting by non-linear regression to an implicit equation, the integrated equation of Michaelis. A simpler method is based on the derivation of the analytical expressions of the conversion time. ",

Contact e-mail: g.zauner@chem.leidenuniv.nl A fluorescence-based system to sense oxygen is described. The method exploits the sensitivity of the fluorescence of type-3 copper proteins towards oxygen by translating the near-UV emission of the protein to label fluorescence in the visible range through a FRET mechanism (Figure 1 ). The main protein in this study, a recombinant tyrosinase from the soil bacterium Streptomyces antibioticus, has been covalently labeled with a variety of fluorescent dye molecules with emission maxima spanning the visible wavelength range. The emission of the label varied considerably between O 2 -bound and O 2 -free protein with a contrast exceeding that of the Trp emission for some labels. Different constructs may be simultaneously observed using a single excitation wavelength. Next to oxygen sensing, the method may be applicable to any protein showing variations in tryptophan fluorescence, for example as a function of ligand binding or catalysis. ",

Crystals of the E114A mutant were reacted with H 2 O 2 in order to trap Fe 3+ -(hydro)peroxo species in the crystals. The structure of the Fe 3+ -(hydro)peroxo species in the SOR active site was determined at 1.95 \u00c5 resolution. Three different conformations around the Fe 3+ -(hydro)peroxo intermediates were characterized.

Contact e-mail: raquel.grazina@dq.fct.unl.pt Ferredoxins are simple iron-sulphur proteins that contain prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulphur atoms and they play a functional role in electron transfer processes relevant for sulphatereducing bacteria (SRB) metabolism. Four distinct types of ferredoxins are found in SRB, containing [3Fe-4S], [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S] plus [4Fe-4S] and 2\u00d7[4Fe-4S] clusters. Desulfovibrio gigas ferredoxin II (DgFdII) is a small tetrameric protein of 58 amino acids, which contains a single [3Fe-4S] cluster and a redox active internal disulfide bridge. DgFdII gene was cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), inserted in the expression vector pET-21c and over expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli). Electrochemical tools can provide important information for the understanding of the redox and mechanistic/structural role of Fe-S clusters and to the interconversion process occurring between 3 Fe and 4 Fe clusters, as well as to the effect of the addition of an extra metal to form heterometal clusters of the type [M3Fe-4S].",

Rosenzweig 1 , 1 Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA; 2 Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; monooxygenase (pMMO) catalyzes the conversion of methane to methanol in methanotrophic bacteria. The crystal structure of pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) revealed three metal centers: a dinuclear copper center and a mononuclear copper center in the soluble portion of the protein and a zinc center in the transmembrane region. 1 The zinc in the transmembrane site was derived from the crystallization buffer, and the physiological occupant of this site was not identified. To address this issue and other questions left unanswered by the M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO structure, we have characterized pMMO from a related organism, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. pMMO from M. trichosporium OB3b has been crystallized and a low resolution structure determined. The structure is similar to that of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO. Anomalous Fourier maps calculated using data collected near the Cu, Zn and Fe absorption edges provide new insight into the identities and functional relevance of the metal ions. According to Cu XAS data, the dinuclear copper center found in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO is also present in M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO. The EPR spectrum of purified M. trichosporium OB3b is similar to that of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO, with a typical type 2 signal and no evidence for a trinuclear cluster. 1 Lieberman, R.

Very recently, we reported the spectroscopic and electrochemical studies of M16F, M16Y, and M16W mutants of blue copper protein, pseudoazurin (PAz) to investigate the effects of the -interaction on the active site structure [1]. The Met16 substituted mutants of PAz, in which several alkyl group has been introduced in the vicinity of the His81 imidazole ligand, have been constructed and characterized in order to elucidate the effects of the indirect weak interaction on the structure and function of the active site. Electronic absorption spectra of M16I, M16V, M16A, M16L mutants and WT showed the absorbance ratio, A~4 60 /A~6 00 were 0.70, 0.61, 0.60, 0.43, and 0.46 respectively. The ratio values except M16L variant are significantly higher than that of WT PAz. The higher value suggests the increasing of rhombic structure population.

Contact e-mail: Punnagai.Munusami@uni-bayreuth.deRecent studies on the cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) CuB center suggested that the deprotonation of the CuB bound imidazole ring of histidine (His291 in mammalian CcO or His284 in Rhodobacter sphaeroides CcO) as a key element in the proton pumping mechanism. The central feature of the proposed mechanism is that pKa values of the imidazole vary significantly depending on the redox state of the metals in the binuclear center. We report the pKa values of the His291, His290 and water molecules both in the oxidized and reduced state of CuB center, where the the pKa values of the His291 was considered to play a significant role in the reaction mechanism of cytochrome c oxidase. We use hydrid density functional theory in combination with continuum electrostatics to calculate the pKa values, successively with aqueous solution and with in the protein, of the Cu-bound imidazoles in oxidized and reduced states respectively. In the present study we considered all the possible protonation equilibrium reactions in the CuB center to understand the deprotonation reactions of His290, His291 and water. The pKa shifts are calculated in protein environment.1. D. M. Popovic, J. Quenneville, A. A. Stuchebrukhov, J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 3616-3626. 2. E. Fadda, N. Chakrabarthi, R. Pom\u00e8s, J.

Contact e-mail: gelascop@cofc.edu The enzyme CytC3 from Streptomyces halogenates the -methyl group of L-aminobutyric acid to produce 4-chloro and 4, 4dichloroaminobutyric acids, of which the latter shows antibacterial activity.(1) To achieve halogenation of the unactivated methyl carbon, CytC3 and other non-heme iron halogenases utilizeketoglutarate in an O 2 dependent reaction to generate a high-valent Fe(IV)-oxo species. The intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, allowing the incorporation of a metal-bound halide into the substrate radical.(2,3) We describe here the structural characterization of the CytC3 Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate that was generated in the presence of bromide rather than chloride using xray absorption and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopies. Iron x-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates an Fe-Br interaction in the reactant CytC3:Fe(II): KG:Br -:L-Aba-S-CytC2 complex of 2.51 \u00c5. When this complex is reacted with oxygen for 2 s, a reaction intermediate is formed in high yield (80%). M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy demonstrates that the novel species contains a high-spin Fe(IV) center. The enhanced preedge feature in the Fe-X-ray absorption spectra and the short Fe-oxygen and Fe-Br interactions of 1.62 \u00c5 and 2.43 \u00c5, respectively, support the formulation of this intermediate as a Br-Fe(IV)-oxo complex.

Contact e-mail: rehab.abdelhamid@gmail.com Several blue copper proteins involving pseudoazurin (PAz) shows a structural transition at alkaline pH. The spectroscopic and electrochemical studies of the alkaline transition of PAz were reported[1,2]. Very recently the effect of the second sphere interaction in the vicinity of the active site of PAz M16X variants, M16Y, M16F, M16W, and M16V has been reported[3]. Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopic studies of wild-type and the M16X variants were performed to know the details of the effect of second sphere interaction on the alkaline transition of pseudoazurin. RR spectra of wild-type and M16X mutants at pH 7.2 and 10.2 were measured in the frequency region of 200-550 cm -1 . The RR spectra of the wild-type and the M16X spectra at pH 7.2 showed five intense Raman bands at 418, 398, 381, 367, and 355 cm -1 and shoulder bands at 335, 439, and 454 cm -1 except M16Val. The RR spectra of wild-type and M16X variants indicated the disappearance of several Raman bands at pH10.2.

Contact e-mail: k.k.andersson@imbv.uio.no High resolution crystal structure of myoglobin in the pH range 5.2-8.7 [1-4] have been used as models for the peroxide-derived compound II intermediates in haem peroxidases and oxygenases. The observed Fe-O bond length (1.86-1.90\u00c5) is consistent with a single bond. This finding is supported by observation of a new low energy 18 O-peroxide-sensitive resonance Raman Fe-O mode at 687 cm -1 [4]. We observe some radiation-induced changes in both compound II (forming a novel semi-stable intermediate H) and in the resting ferric state of myoglobin by single-crystal microspectrophotometry [4]. Our data suggest for myoglobin the compound II intermediate consists of a Fe IV -O species with a single bond. The presence of Fe IV is indicated by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy [4], and quantum refinements and DFT-calculations suggest that this species is protonated[2,3]. The presence of a Fe IV -OH state seems to be general for compound II intermediates. Additionally, an isoelectronic form of the compound 0 intermediate has been generated by radiation-induced changes (to be submitted J. Am. Chem. Soc).[1] Hersleth, H.-P., Dalhus, B., G\u00f6rbitz, C.

            "text": "Ferritin initiates iron mineralization by catalytic coupling of ferrous iron and molecular oxygen at multiple, di-iron sites A and B containing some of ligands common to diiron oxygenases where iron is a cofactor, in contrast to ferritin where iron is a substrate. Site A, Glu, Glu-x-x-His is common to all the di-iron proteins (eg. methane monooxygenase, ribonucleotide reductase, ferritins) but site B, Glu, Gln-x-x-Asp/Ser/Ala is ferritin-specific.. Here we report the catalytic effects of engineering ferritin site B to mimic the oxygenase sites with the following changes: Site B: EED-Gln137Glu, site B-EQH-Asp140His, and site B-EEH-Gln137Glu/Asp140His). Substitution of His for Asp, whether in B site EQH or EEH mutant, inactivated catalysis with the initial rates of the ferrous oxidation decreased to 1.0-2.0% of WT ferritin. However, for B-site EED, with the conservative Gln137Glu substitution, catalysis was only slightly inhibited (73% of that of WT). In spite of the similar initial rates, the reaction pathway was altered by the Gln/Glu mutation in Site B-EED since the di-ferric peroxo intermediate was undetectable and, using entry into the slower phases of mineral formation as a reporter, dissociation of the diferric oxy (hydroxyo) product and mineral precursor appeared to be inhibited. These results indicate that ferritin-specific Site B iron ligands control the reaction pathway for rapid iron oxidation/coupling and release of diferric oxo/hydroxo mineral precursors in rapid iron mineralization of ferritin. Part support DK20251 (ECT and TT) and the JSPS (TT). c-type cytochromes are electron transfer proteins that are essential for the life of virtually all organisms. They characteristically carry covalently-bound heme via thioether bonds to two cysteines in the protein. In Gram-negative bacteria, biogenesis of c-type cytochrome is conducted by a multiprotein complex system known as a cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) system. This system consists of 8 gene products (ccmA-ccmH). CcmE, which binds heme and delivers it to apocytochrome c, is called as a heme chaperonE. In the previous study, covalent attachment of heme to cytochrome c was achieved in the presence of only CcmE, heme, and dithiothreitol. However, the precise mechanism remains to be clarified. In this study, we applied UV/vis absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies to the reaction of CcmE with apocytochrome c to understand the mechanism of heme transfer and covalent bond formation. After addition of apocytochrome c into CcmE in the presence of sodium dithionite and dithiothreitol, the Soret maximum shifted to 417 nm from 400 nm, and two new bands appeared at 527 and 533 nm. The positions of these bands were different from those of neither CcmE nor cytochrome c in the reduced form. Unfortunately, resonance Raman spectrum of the mixture of CcmE and apocytochrome c under the same condition was hindered by strong fluorescence probably caused by the dissociated heme. The results of the absorption spectral changes suggest that heme is not transferred from CcmE to apocytochrome c simultaneously, but an unspecified transient form is formed during the heme transfer.",

Contact e-mail: unno19@tagen.tohoku.ac.jp Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the O 2 -dependent conversion of heme to biliverdin, Fe, and CO through three successive oxygenation steps in which the heme participates both as a substrate and as a cofactor. The first oxygenation of heme occurs regiospecifically at the -meso position to afford -mesohydroxyheme. A ferric hydroperoxo intermediate (Fe III -OOH) has been identified as the meso-hydroxylating species, different from other heme enzymes which employ compound I as their reactive species. To gain further insight into the HO catalytic mechanism, we determined the crystal structures of the hydroperoxo heme-and the -meso-hydroxyheme intermediates of HmuO, a bacterial HO, at 1.9 \u00c5 and 1.5 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively. The hydroperoxo intermediate was generated by X-ray-induced photoreduction of the oxy crystal at cryogenic temperature. This intermediate was highly susceptible to the incident X-ray radiation, and only merging the independent diffraction data from 20 crystals attained successful structure determination. The Fe-O distance is slightly longer and Fe-O-O angle is smaller by 5 \u00b0 than those found in the oxy structure. The diffraction data set for the hydroxyheme intermediate was collected after brief annealing the crystal of the hydroperoxo intermediate near room temperature. The hydroxyheme shifts along the heme -axis, and the distal helix moves in the opposite direction compared with the hydroperoxo heme complex. The proton, required for activation of hydroperoxo, could be delivered to the proximal oxygen from nearby water through this rearrangement of the active site. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative disease of motor neurons. The inherited form of the disease, familial ALS, represents almost 10% of the cases reported and there is strong evidence that these are due to the mutations in the gene encoding copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Recent studies showed that SOD1 mutations, more than the loss of normal function, induce gain of a toxic function. The finding of proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions containing SOD1 in motor neurons of postmortem familial ALS patients, suggests that aggregation of mutant SOD1 produces a pathogenic species, and the insoluble aggregates may represent only the final form of a previous pathological state, which is eliminated by cells inducing its aggregation.We have characterized the WT SOD1 protein in the apo and metallated states with respect to its ability to form aggregates. Fluorescence studies using the Thioflavin T probe, coupled with gel chromatography, show that a soluble aggregate forms in vitro during incubation at 37 \u00baC of an apo sample of SOD1 at physiological conditions (pH 7, 100 M). We have further characterized this aggregate. This species might constitute the first seed for a subsequent insoluble aggregate formation. Further studies will focus on investigating the propensity of a selected set of pathogenic SOD1 mutants to form soluble aggregates.",

Contact e-mail: jutta.vlasits@boku.ac.at Catalase-peroxidases (KatGs) exhibit peroxidase and substantial catalase activities similar to monofunctional catalases. Crystal structures of four different prokaryotic KatGs reveal the presence of a peroxidase-conserved proximal and distal heme pocket together with features unique to KatG. Marked differences in the structural role of conserved amino acids and hydrogen-bond networks in KatG with respect to other plant-type heme peroxidases were found.* Typically, the catalatic but not the peroxidatic activity was very sensitive to mutations that disrupted the KatG-typical extensive hydrogen-bonding network.* By contrast, the endogenous peroxidase substrate(s) and binding site(s) in KatG are unknown. Typical for KatG is a unique distal Trp-Tyr-Met adduct with a joining arginine that can move between two conformations. The side-chain of this Arg is located on the surface of a cleft with a well-defined U-shaped region. Structural analysis and sequence alignment revealed the presence of several highly conserved residues in this region that could play a role in binding and oxidation of one-electron donors. Here, we present data on Synechocystis KatG and the effect of exchange of R509, W459, K435, N278 and E281 on the bifunctional activity and interconversion and spectral properties of redox intermediates. *Smulevich, G., Jakopitsch, G., Droghetti, E., Obinger, C. Aminopeptidase from Aeromonas proteolytica (AAP) serves as an example of a metallohydrolase in which the active site structure has a -hydroxo--carboxylato-dimetal core. This core is a common structural motif in many metallohydrolases which are active in the dicobalt(II) forms including methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) and glycerophosphodiesterase (GpdQ). One interesting feature of the dicobalt(II) active site is the extent of magnetic exchange coupling between the Co(II) ions. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) can be used to determine magnetic exchange coupling, and the AAP active site is particularly well suited for MCD study because three different metal-substituted forms, Helicobacter pylori is a micro-aerophilic, Gram-negative, spiralshaped organism. [1] [2] Similar to Hpn, Hpn-like (Hpnl), a histidineand glutamine-rich (25% and 40%) protein in H. pylori, may play a putative role in nickel detoxification and influence the active levels of Ni-activated urease. [3] [4] We cloned gene from H. pylori 11637 strains, over-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and purified the protein. Our UV-vis spectra reveals Hpnl binds 2 nickel ions per monomer at pH 7.5. This binding was reversible: metal could be released from Hpnl in the presence of the chelating ligand EDTA. Ni 2+ also induced conformation changes of the protein, with -helix content decrease from 26% to 20% and -sheet increase from 14% to 22%. Growth curves of E. coli BL21 both with and without hpnl gene implied a role for Hpnl to protect the cells from higher concentrations of outside Ni 2+ Fourteen metals are known to be essential for plants and animals. However, their concentrations in cells have to be strictly regulated at their optimum levels, since too much or too little is often lethal. The molecular details of these control mechanisms are poorly understood in most cases. The simple plant Arabidopsis thaliana has eight P1B-type ATPase (HMA 1-8) responsible for uptake and elimination of various metals. Phylogenetic analysis shows that HMA 1-4 are likely to transport divalent cations and that HMA 5-8 are likely to transport monovalent cations. However, the molecular basis of such metal transporting specificity is not known. The N-terminus of each HMA protein, HMAn comprises one or more metal binding domains that may contribute to the metal specificity. For example, a metal binding motif (CXXC; C, cysteine; X, another amino acid) typical for Cu(I) was present in HMA7n while a cysteine pair (CC) was found in both HMA2n and HMA4n and may promote Zn(II) binding. To understand the possible roles of the N-terminus in metal binding and selection, we have cloned, expressed and purified the N-terminal domains of the HMA4 and HMA7 with selected mutants. Metal binding affinity and specificity have been studied, together with structural aspects. The results will be presented and discussed.",
