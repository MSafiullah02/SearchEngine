Patients were characterized by fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, and hypoxemia; and death could be a result of progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage. The syndrome was designated \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2019 (SARS). The identification of the etiologic agent, a novel coronavirus, as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was quickly made by international collaboration [1], [2]. By 31 July 2003, when the pandemic terminated, 8096 people in 26 countries had been diagnosed with probable SARS, 774 of whom died [http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html]. In the winter of 2003\u20132004, sporadic cases were reported, including four cases in Guangdong province, and laboratory acquired SARS from Singapore, Taiwan and Beijing [http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome/en/index.html]. Although the death rate is low in comparison with fatalities during previous pandemics, the rapidity of spread due to air travel, the coverage in the media and the enormous economic and social impacts, the fear of renewed outbreaks as well as the potential misuse of the virus as a biological weapon all contribute to the far more pronounced impact of SARS-CoV. Since the identification of the etiological agent, rapid progress has been made towards understanding this newly emerged pathogen. Most previously published reviews focused on the epidemiology, clinical presentation and potential treatment of SARS-CoV infection; this review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of SARS pathogenesis.",

However, it should be noted that colonic enterocytes as well as the liver tissue were largely negative for ACE2 protein expression, while SARS-CoV replication does occur therein. In contrast, whereas ACE2 is strongly expressed on the endothelial cells of arteries and veins of all tissues and the smooth muscle cells of the intestinal tract, there is no evidence of virus infection at any of these sites [10].

Another study proved that L-SIGN is a receptor for SARS-CoV with the expression cloning method [12]. This study also indicated that cells expressing L-SIGN became susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, but L-SIGN was a less efficient receptor when compared with ACE2 [12]. L-SIGN also is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein in the C-type lectin family. It has a structure similar to that of DC-SIGN, except that L-SIGN has considerable polymorphism in the tandem repeat domain. Since L-SIGN has much higher polymorphism, there must exist different combinations in the population. Chan et al. found that homozygous expression of polymorphic variants of L-SIGN plays a protective role in SARS-CoV infection, because cells homozygous for L-SIGN show higher binding capacity for SARS-CoV, higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a low capacity for trans infection [13].",

In the native state, spike proteins on the virus surface could be in oligomeric form and form the stems of the spikes on SARS-CoV; HR1 regions may be in random coil conformation covered by the S1 domain. After binding to ACE2 on the target cells, the S2 domain changes conformation by forming \u03b1-helices, extending and inserting its inert fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, and exposing HR1 and HR2 regions. Then the HR1 and HR2 regions form a six-helix oligomeric complex, with the HR2 trimer as a core. This fusion-active core structure brings the viral and target cell membranes into close proximity, resulting in fusion between the membranes and formation of fusion pores, which allows the virus genome to enter the target cell [14].",

The spike glycoproteins of most of the enveloped RNA viruses can mediate the attachment, fusion and entry of the virus. However, an activating trigger, which can result in a conformational change, is usually required to make the spike glycoproteins fulfill their functions. For example, binding to specific receptors/coreceptors is the activating trigger for MLV and HIV, while the influenza virus requires only an acidic milieu. However, this is different in the case of SARS-CoV, as some groups have found that a special endosomal protease, cathepsin L, was crucial in the activation of viral infectivity; inhibitors of cathepsin L can prevent SARS-CoV entry [15]. So SARS-CoV may first bind to ACE2 on the cell surface and be taken up into a vesicle (endocytosis). Later, cleavage of spike protein or ACE2 by cathepsin L facilitates fusion of the viral membrane and the vesicle membrane. These results are consistent with previous findings showing that the inhibitors of vacuolar acidification could block infection by S-bearing pseudotypes in a dose-dependent manner [5], as cathepsin L is a pH-dependent cysteine protease with its maximal activity in an acidic milieu and may lose its activity with increasing pH.",

The increasing viral load during this phase suggests that the symptoms are largely related to the effect of viral replication and cytolysis; however, this may also be due to antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies. In phase 2, which begins about 8 days after onset of fever, patients frequently had recurrence of fever, onset of diarrhea, and oxygen desaturation. The timing of IgG seroconversion, which starts on day 10, seems to correlate with falls in viral load, which occurs between days 10 and 15. Severe clinical worsening also occurs at this time.

The immune-related genes that were overexpressed after the onset of SARS are usually associated with the innate immune response against bacterial infection and not against a viral infection. For example, the expression of lactoferrin is upregulated [23]. In addition, other innate immune defenses, such as the collectins, which can bind the glycosylated SARS-CoV S protein, may play an important role in host defense. This suggests that the response of SARS affected patients is mainly an innate inflammatory response rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection [23]. Besides the function of limiting virus spread, the immunological response against viral infection can also cause pathological damage to the host tissues. This is especially a concern in the case of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nicholls and colleagues suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines released by activated macrophages in alveoli could have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of SARS [24].",

SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells can lead to apoptosis. Further studies showed that a variety of signaling pathways were phosphorylated or dephosphorylated when the cells were infected with SARS-CoV. Specifically, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is thought to be involved in induction of apoptosis, since Mizutani et al. found that the p38 MAPK and its downstream targets, MAPKAPK-2 and HSP-27 were activated during viral replication [28]. A p38 inhibitor was able to partially prevent cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV infection. The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, which is usually constitutively phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue (705), is dephosphorylated by SARS-CoV-induced activation of p38 [28]. Although Akt, an inhibitor of apoptosis, was also partially activated, this weak activation cannot prevent SARS-CoV infection-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. And recently, research on the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (p90RSKs), an important substrate of the ERK, showed that the specific serine residue (380) of p90RSKs, that has been reported to be involved in autophosphorylation by activation of the C-terminal kinase domain, was phosphorylated in confluent SARS-CoV infected cells, and this phosphorylation can be inhibited by an inhibitor of p38 MAPK [29].

First we found that experimental infections of SARS-CoV in wild-type mice resulted in considerably reduced ACE2 expression in the lungs, while ACE expression was not changed. To further test our hypothesis, we established a defined model system using recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein. This model system allowed us to avoid possible secondary effects resulting from viral replication or infections in vivo and to directly test whether SARS-CoV spike protein might adversely affect acute lung injury through modulation of ACE2. With this system we found that binding of spike to endogenous ACE2 in Vero E6 cells also resulted in downregulation of ACE2 surface expression. Further studies showed that treatment with spike protein worsened the lung function in wild-type mice. Moreover, spike treatment of acid-challenged wild-type mice augmented the pathological changes in the lung parenchyma and increased lung edema, while in vivo spike protein administration did not affect the severity of lung failure in ACE2 knockout mice, indicating that the effect of spike protein on acute lung injury is ACE2 specific. Thus we hypothesize that infection with SARS-CoV can result in ACE2 downregulation through binding of SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2. Given that ACE2 is a key negative regulatory factor for severity of lung edema and acute lung failure, SARS-CoV spike protein-mediated ACE2 downregulation then contributes to the severity of lung pathologies [8] (Fig. 1).",

The latter has lower affinity to human ACE2, mainly due to an alteration of amino acid residues at sites 479 and 487 [35].

ACE can cleave angiotensin I to produce angiotensin II, which can then either bind to AT1aR leading to lung injury, or bind to AT2R reducing the severity of lung injury. ACE2, on the contrary, can counteract ACE by converting the angiotensin II to a less damaging molecule. SARS-CoV infection or spike protein treatment can down-regulate the expression of ACE2, and thus aggravate lung injury. Based on these findings, ACE inhibitor (such as lisinopri, captopri), AT1aR inhibitor (such as losartan, valsartan) as well as recombinant human ACE2 (rhuACE2), are all potential drugs for this kind of acute lung injury.",
