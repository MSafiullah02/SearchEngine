Due to the severity of disease and slow recovery, the LNB diagnosis was questioned and another lumbar puncture was performed. Both serum and CSF were screened for antibodies associated with AIE and paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS). When testing for AIE (using NMDAR, CASPR2, AMPAR1/2, LGI1 and GABAB-R fixed transfected HEK293 cells (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany)), an unspecific spherical reaction with NMDAR transfected cells was seen in serum and CSF (Fig. 1a, b). These reactions did not resemble the characteristic fluorescence pattern of the anti-NMDAR positive control and hence, both samples were considered negative (Fig. 1c). In the meantime, samples had also been sent to another laboratory, which now reported anti-NMDAR antibodies strongly positive in serum and CSF. Due to this discrepancy, the patients planned discharge was delayed, and samples were re-evaluated at a reference laboratory. They confirmed that both samples were negative for anti-NMDAR antibodies. Screening for anti-neural antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence test (IFT) using primate cerebellum as substrate (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) was negative in serum. In CSF, a weak, unspecific reaction was seen, not indicative of anti-NMDAR antibodies (Fig. 1d). Immunoblotting for PNS antibodies was negative (Euroline Neuronal Antigens Profile 12 Ag (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany)).",

An unspecific spherical reaction, not resembling the characteristic pattern of the anti-NMDAR positive control, was seen with NMDAR transfected cells.

In their case, the clinical picture was in line with the well-known disease course of anti-NMDAR-encephalitis. In our case, the initial anti-NMDAR result was mistakenly reported as positive; however, the clinical picture was not compatible with anti-NMDAR AIE but with severe LNB. At no time during the patient\u2019s admittance did she have signs of impaired cognitive function. The initial report of a positive anti-NMDAR test complicated the patient\u2019s course of admittance, but was questioned, and samples were re-evaluated at a reference laboratory. Finally, the reactions were considered unspecific and concluded negative. Furthermore, screening for anti-neural antibodies by IFT on primate cerebellum was not indicative of anti-NMDAR. Cell surface neuronal antibodies, like anti-NMDAR antibodies, can react with cells in the cerebellar granular layer, giving a blotchy fluorescence on IFT. Performing IFT on cerebellar sections is informative, when suspecting both AIE and PNS. Later re-testing of the patient for anti-NMDAR was again negative.",
