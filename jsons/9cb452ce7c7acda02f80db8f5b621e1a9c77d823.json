When tales of heroism were supplanted, temporarily, by fears of bioterrorism as the ominously numbered room 911 of the Metropole Hotel accommodated the first case to come to widespread attention in the West? The true origin turned out to be nature, not man, acting as a malign force to create a novel pathogen. And now, we have another virus from the same family affecting the same body system as the one from a decade ago. Will it stay localised to small pockets of infection or cause another pandemic like its cousin?",

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent [2] and the palm civit the offending mammal vector that facilitated transfer from bats [1] . The cellular receptor was identified as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [3] .",

SARS-CoV was not highly contagious early in the disease course but, once the viral load peaked around day 10 of illness, the scene was set for transmission, especially when respiratory secretions were manipulated during clinical care. Standard precautions for control of infection, coupled with restrictions on international travel, were effective at terminating transmission and ending the pandemic, but left behind a case fatality rate of approximately 10% among the more than 8000 people affected [1] . Many treatments were tried in sick patients but without the controls necessary to determine if any intervention had beneficial or detrimental effects. Indeed, a systematic review, requested by WHO, commented that there was no evidence of efficacy, whereas several studies showed possible evidence of harm from the treatments offered, including ribavirin and steroids [5] .",

Interestingly, in organ cultures, nCoV infected endothelial cells, type II pneumocytes and non-ciliated bronchial epithelium as well as the ciliated cells that respiratory viruses normally prefer [12] . In epithelial cell cultures, the nCoV disrupted the host transcriptome more than did SARS-CoV; specifically, nCoV downregulated both Class I and Class II major histocompatibility complex genes [13] . These components of the antigen presentation system were targeted by known inhibitors of signalling pathways, with corresponding reductions in viral titres shown for at least one compound [13] . In Vero and rhesus monkey kidney cell cultures, virus replication was inhibited by ribavirin and interferon, with evidence of an additive effect of the combination [14] . Genetic studies point to a bat origin for the virus [7] with speculation that animals found in the Gulf, such as camels and goats, might provide the link to humans [15] . As of 25 April 2013, there have been 17 cases with 11 deaths [8] . The median age of the patients has been 45, with an excess of males. They are grouped into four clusters; a healthcare facility in Jordan, two separate families in Saudi Arabia and a family in the UK with a member who had travelled from Saudi Arabia [8] . So far, there is only limited evidence of person-to-person transmission [16, 17] .",
