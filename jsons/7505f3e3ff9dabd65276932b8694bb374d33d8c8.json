The effects on cellular aging processes are incompletely understood. METHODS: Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by qPCR in this longitudinal cohort study with blood samples taken at birth and at 2 years of age from 60 children (16 preterm and 44 term). Viral respiratory infections the first year were evaluated. Epigenetic biological DNA methylation (DNAm) age was predicted based on methylation array data in 23 children (11 preterm and 12 term). RTL change/year and DNAm age change/year was compared in preterm and term during the 2 first years of life. RESULTS: Preterm infants had longer telomeres than term born at birth and at 2 years of age, but no difference in telomere attrition rate could be detected. Predicted epigenetic DNAm age was younger in preterm infants, but rate of DNAm aging was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite early exposure to risk factors for accelerated cellular aging, children born preterm exhibited preserved telomeres. Stress during the neonatal intensive care period did not reflect accelerated epigenetic DNAm aging. Early-life aging was not explained by preterm birth.",

            "text": "Telomere length, a marker of cellular replicative history, is negatively influenced by infections, inflammation, and oxidative stress, 5, 6 and there is an aging process due to oxidative stress starting already in the perinatal period in life. 7, 8 Diseases such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer's disease are oxidative stress related and have been associated with shorter leukocyte telomeres. 9 Telomere attrition can be slowed down by activation of the enzyme telomerase, adding telomeric repeats to the telomere ends, and telomerase activity is highly regulated and not expressed in most somatic cells. 10 Children have a faster telomere attrition rate compared to adults, shortening with 1000 base pair per year (bp/year) up to 4 years of age compared to 30 bp/year in adults. 11 In preterm infants, an even faster telomere attrition rate has been reported, with a shortening of 230 bp/week. 12, 13 A faster telomere attrition rate for males compared to females have also been observed. 14 The faster telomere attrition rate measured in blood cells during childhood may be explained by the active cell expansion and renewal of the hematopoietic precursors. 13 In addition, the white blood cell composition changes during life, especially in infancy, 15 which may influence cellular aging measurements made on whole blood. One challenge is to achieve longitudinal studies in newborn infants, especially if born preterm, due to the need of repeated blood sampling over a short period of time in infants already at risk of being compromised and with a low circulating total blood volume. A study of preterm baboons showed rapid telomere attrition rate during the first year of life and measured in parallel the turnover of hematopoietic stem cell types and found longer telomere length in T cells compared to granulocytes and B cells at birth. This difference disappeared at 2 years of age. They concluded that there was a biphasic pattern of stem cell turnover with an initially rapid cell division that declined during the second year of life and similarly a rapid telomere attrition during the first year of life that subsequently slowed down. 16 Infants born preterm are reported to have longer telomeres at birth than those born term; 12,17,18 however, being born smaller than expected for the gestational age (small for gestational age (SGA)) was not associated with shorter telomere length at birth. 19 Data on the development of telomere length over time in newborn infants, telomere attrition, is scarce, especially for preterm infants. Cross-sectional measurements in adolescents show similar telomere length for preterm born and healthy term born children, with longer telomeres in girls irrespective of prematurity and a negative correlation to lung function, that could not be explained by perinatal events. 3 We have previously reported a study of 10-year-old preterm born children with a history of BPD compared to a group of term born children with asthma showing that the strongest predictors for short telomeres at age 10 years were impaired lung function and male sex, rather than prematurity alone. 20 Epigenetic modifications are dynamic cellular responses to the environment that can silence or activate genes without altering the DNA sequence. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one epigenetic mechanism where a methyl group is added to a carbon atom on a cytosine followed by a guanine (called CpG sites). DNAm is not only an important regulator of cell function and development and for maintaining chromosome stability but can also function as a marker of cellular aging (epigenetic DNAm age). 21 Understanding the role of hypermethylated or hypomethylated genomic regions in disease development and progression in relation to prematurity is a rapidly growing field of research, mainly in relation to stressful exposures during neonatal intensive care, and was recently reviewed by Casavant et al. 22 It is important to further elucidate telomere biology in relation to preterm birth as it may provide both prognostic markers and effect measures for future disease. We hypothesize that telomere attrition rate would be accelerated in children born preterm and that this would be reflected in faster biological aging. Therefore, the objective of this cohort study was to longitudinally investigate leukocyte cellular aging measured by telomere length and attrition rate and estimate epigenetic biological DNAm age during the first 2 years of life in relation to preterm birth, perinatal factors, and postnatal viral infections.",

Eligible for inclusion in the LUFT study were infants born preterm (before gestational week 36 +6 ) during January 2009 to March 2011 and admitted to one neonatal unit at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. Exclusion criteria were children with major malformations or neurological impairment preventing later lung function testing. The control group were healthy children born at term (gestational week 37 +0 -41 +6 ) on the same day as the index child and matched for sex and maternal smoking. The protocol included blood sampling at two time points: cord blood at birth and peripheral blood at follow-up at 2 years of age. Respiratory infections during the first year of life were monitored. Parents kept a diary and were instructed to report to the hospital for clinical evaluation when their child showed symptoms of infection. Nasopharyngeal sampling for viral infections (adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus (Oc 43, 229 E, NL 63, HKU1), enterovirus, rhinovirus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydia pneumoniae) was performed at every infection episode and analyzed by routine PCR methods at Karolinska University Hospital Laboratory.

            "text": "Interestingly, we found that exposure of viral infection during the first year of life resulted in significantly longer telomeres at 2 years of age and a trend toward slower telomere attrition rate (Supplementary Table S2 ). Respiratory infections during the first year were common in both preterm and term born children (overall 88%), although more severe in the preterm group with more bronchiolitis or hospital admissions. The hypothesis that infections will increase oxidative stress and thereby result in faster telomere attrition could not be confirmed in our cohort. As previously reported, preterm children in our study had longer telomeres compared to term born children 17, 26 both at birth and at 2 years of age. The longer telomeres at 2 years of age in children with infections found in our study could not be explained by preterm having more viral infections during the first year of life since preterm and term born children were exposed to infections to the same extent (Supplementary Table S2 ). Another reason explaining preserved telomeres could be that we measured telomere length in a different subset of white blood cells, in which the cell composition had been changed after an infection. Telomere length is known to be longer in naive T lymphocytes compared to granulocytes 27 but not in memory T and B cells. 28 Rufer et al. showed that telomere attrition rate was faster in lymphocytes compared to granulocytes in 500 individuals between 0 and 90 years of age suggesting that a rapid hematopoietic turnover in early childhood results in increased telomere attrition and then a shift with aging from naive to memory T cells 29 and thereby a slower attrition rate. In a recent publication by Olin et al. we showed that preterm infants have higher levels of CD4+ T cells and lower levels of neutrophils compared to term born infants at birth but these differences normalize early in life. 30 We still do not know exactly how cell composition develops and affect telomere length and within what time frame from a viral infection a change in telomere length could be detected. Therefore, we cannot be sure if this will reflect how viral infections during the first year of life will affect telomere length at 2 years of age that we measured in our cohort.",

            "text": "Provenzi et al. suggested stress-related telomere erosion in children needing neonatal intensive care. 18 Our cohort of sixteen preterm infants was rather mature and had little neonatal morbidity. Standard of care for extremely preterm born infants in Sweden include management for pain relief, parental involvement with both skin-to-skin care and supporting parental-infant bonding from the moment of birth as well as having the parents stay at the ward together with their infants around the clock, from admission to discharge from the hospital. Breastfeeding is also promoted and all infants born preterm in our cohort received bank milk if mother's own milk was not available. More than half of the infants born term were exclusively breastfed at 4 months of chronological age. Wojcicki et al. showed in 4-year-old children that exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of age was correlated to longer telomeres. 31 In our study, breast milk was highly available for both term and preterm born infants early in life and do not explain the longer telomeres we found in preterm infants. Wojcicki et al. also measured change in telomere length from birth to 2.4 years of age with a yearly change of \u22120.08 \u00b1 0.6, 32 which correspond to the same telomere attrition rate for term infants that we found in our study. Despite spending 5-10 weeks after birth at the hospital and being exposed to more severe respiratory tract infections during the first year of life, preterm infants in our cohort had longer telomeres than term born infants and cellular aging was not accelerated. The low neonatal morbidity and very close parental involvement might elude some of that stress-related telomere erosion described by Provenzi et al. in infants in need of neonatal intensive care.",

Despite that, we think the evidence in our study suggests that preterm infants do not have accelerated cellular aging.

To conclude, despite early exposure to risk factors for accelerated aging, children born preterm exhibited preserved telomeres and did not show accelerated epigenetic DNAm aging. The stress of neonatal intensive care and the added stress following exposure to respiratory viral infections during the first year of life did not lead to accelerated biological aging. Cellular aging is faster early in life compared to later in childhood or in adulthood, and we still do not fully understand why.
