Today, smart technology applications have become more and more prevalent in mobile health care [2, 3]. For example, Baek et al. [4] designed a smart diagnostic chair that could measure unconstrained heart rate and blood pressure without the direct contact between embedded instruments and bare skin of the users. According to the survey by Baig and Gholamhosseini [5], no less than fifty smart health monitoring systems have since been invented at the time of their survey. These smart health monitoring systems automate patient monitoring tasks and facilitate workflow management. A smart surveillance system to detect abnormal motions of a user in emergency situations has been devised by Jung and Chung [6]. As noted by Natarajan et al. [7], smart sensors adopted by a mobile health care system could be connected via an Internet of things (IoT), thereby facilitating the aggregation of various information sources to judge the health problem of a user accurately.",

So far, most applications of smart technologies to mobile health care have been intended to improve disease management (such as monitoring the health/disease status, adjusting the medication dosage, and increasing adherence to prescribed medication) and to change health behaviors [3, 12]. For a mobile health care service to be successful, five tasks need to be fulfilled, including allocation concealment, allocation sequence determination, blinding, complete follow-up, and the measurement of effects [3].",

This is an urgent and critical topic for the following reasons. First, the worldwide market for mobile health care is predicted to grow from an estimated 134 billion in 2016 to 280 billion by 2021 [13]. The market scale is large with numerous opportunities for related industries and companies. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related efforts in the United States are moving health services from fee-for-service (FFS) models to managed care, value-added payment or value-based (VB) models that may be built on smart technology applications [14]. More recently, advances in cloud computing and big data analytics [15] have enabled the analysis of massive data collected from mobile users via smart technologies in real time. With use of earlier technological applications quickly becoming obsolete, this is a critical step to achieve more precise recommendations for individualized care services.",

To this end, the fuzzy geometric mean-fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FGM-FAHP) approach is proposed. The FGM-FAHP approach aggregates multiple experts\u2019 judgments on the relative importance levels of critical factors and derives the weight for each. These weights provide valuable information to manage activities on the realization of the critical factors under limited resources [16]. In addition, a judgment modification mechanism is also incorporated in the FGM-FAHP approach, so that an expert can modify his/her judgment subjectively if that deviates considerably from the consensus, which was not considered in [17]. Further, experts can be of unequal authority levels, so that the decision-making process can be led by an authoritative professional, which is another novelty of this study when compared to earlier studies [17], [18], [19].",

Some of these apps are based on the co-work of participants, while others are peer-led (i.e., led by people who have more experience or professional knowledge). In contrast, some apps for online social networking, such as Facebook and Line, have been applied to support mobile health care. People share health care related information and discuss with each other in such online social networks. In addition, rich multimedia, virtual reality, and augmented reality are also incorporated into a mobile health care app to provide vivid experiences of distant health care delivery [39]. In the past, it was pads or smart glasses that were usually adopted to support such functions [40, 41]. However, advances in smart phone technologies and the several advantages of a smart phone (e.g., light weight, unobtrusiveness, etc.) have made it a more suitable alternative in recent years.",

When the smart watch detects a gesture made by the user, it will then transmit a signal to the smart phone to activate certain devices such as the screen or a camera. Where the camera is used to capture an image, the image could then be compared with several predefined images, representing certain risk, a specific location, or a facility.

The robot can deliver food or drinks, assist with cooking, and clean [45]. Instead of developing a more sophisticated service robot, Linner et al. [44] employed multiple cooperating service robots (i.e., a service robot system). Various types of service robots were selected to fit the layout and furniture of a room and to compensate for each other. Moreover, sensors were installed throughout the room to detect signals for activating these service robots. Advantages of applying robotic technologies to health care in serving as flexible physical assistant substitutes have been summarized in Linner et al. [44].

However, the upper bound of the fuzzy consistency index was high, showing that there was considerable uncertainty behind such a judgement. Given that smart technology applications to mobile health care are still in their infancy, this finding was not surprising.\u2022A parametric analysis was conducted to assess the effect of the number of experts (P) on the fuzzy consistency ratio (CR\u02dc). The results are shown in Fig. 5\n. In this experiment, two experts were sufficient to minimize (or optimize) CR\u02dc. However, such a conclusion was based on consistency only. Involving more experts, so as to consider diversified viewpoints, was also meaningful to the practice.\u2022Two existing methods, FGM-fuzzy extent analysis (FEA) [57] and the FGM-alpha cut operations (ACO)-FWA method [17], were also applied to the collected data for comparison. In the FGM-FEA method, experts\u2019 judgments were aggregated using FGM. Then, the weight of a critical factor was set to its minimal degree of being the maximum. As a result, the weight of a critical factor was estimated in a crisp value and did not need to be defuzzified. In the FGM-ACO-FWA method, experts\u2019 judgments were also aggregated using FGM. Then, the weight of a critical factor was derived using ACO. The results of applying various methods are compared in Table 9\n. The results using the FGM-ACO-FWA method were close to those using the proposed methodology. However, the FGM-ACO-FWA method was not able to consider experts\u2019 unequal authority levels. In addition, it was possible to obtain weights with zero values using the FGM-FEA method.\u2022The execution time of the proposed methodology using MATLAB on a personal computer (PC) with an i7-7700 CPU of 3.6 GHz and 8 GB RAM was less than 1 s, while that of the FGM-ACO-FWA method was up to 21 s, which showed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In addition, experts were allowed to modify their judgments in the proposed methodology, but were not allowed in the FGM-ACO-FWA method.\n",

First, a mobile health care system should support users in an unobtrusive, interconnected, adaptable, dynamic, embedded, and intelligent manner [24].

Although a number of smart technologies can be applied to assist mobile health care delivery, tools specifically devised for implementing mobile health care are still lacking [35]. In addition, the real-time availability information of a service facility is critical to the effectiveness of a mobile healthcare service.

First, using a smart phone actively or passively (e.g., hearing an alert without picking up the smart phone) affects the concentration of a user and may cause safety problems while walking, driving, or working [59]. It is even more difficult for people with low or impaired vision to use smart phones, which prevents them from using the related applications [42]. This difficulty can be resolved by providing them with screen readers or allowing them to give voice or gesture commands (with the aid of a smart watch) [42]. Even when a smart phone is used safely, detecting the location of the user by using the GPS module on his/her smart phone is subject to imprecision [29], which affects the quality of inputs to a health care app. Existing health care apps are also subjected to several difficulties [60]. For example, answering numerous questions is not always convenient to a mobile user. To address this problem, a \u201cshort-form\u201d survey is usually adopted to assess the functional health and well-being of a mobile user [59]. However, addressing all the concerns of a mobile user by applying this method is impossible. This leads to misjudgment by the system server [60]. Other problems include the breach of a user's confidentiality, the conflicts of interests, malfunction, the lack of business models, and privacy issues [33].",

Augusto and Xie [65] formulated and solved a mixed-integer linear programming problem for planning the transportation and replenishment of medicine for the pharmacy of a hospital. Alfonso et al. [66] constructed a Petri net for modeling the mobile behaviors of blood donors. However, a Petri net is based on numerous assumptions on probability distributions and parameter independence. Chen [27] solved a fuzzy integer nonlinear programming problem to determine the no-wait path to each nearby clinic for a patient. Then, he applied OWA to determine the clinic that was most suitable for the patient. However, the method was either too theoretical or not adequately efficient for real-time applications. To solve this problem, a recent study proposed a heuristic that could be easily implemented for online applications [67].

Some cloud service providers such as Google Cloud can help develop system servers that support mobile apps. In addition, new techniques for balancing the loads on health care facilities and resources have been proposed in the recent years. Health care facilities and resources in a mobile health care system are recommended and allocated to users through the intervention of the system server, which attempts to balance the loads on health care facilities and resources to prevent them from congestion or underuse, thereby providing opportunities to improve their performance. For example, the average waiting time in a crowded clinic can be reduced, whereas the utilization of an infrequently visited clinic can be improved. In light of this, users\u2019 requirements can be more effectively mapped to the capabilities of clinics and hospitals.",
