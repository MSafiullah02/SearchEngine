Cells maintain protein homeostasis via evolutionarily conserved protective mechanism called protein quality control (PQC), involving extensive chaperones and degradative pathways. When PQC encounters misfolded protein it is either repaired or disposed via the ubiquitin proteasomal system 1. When this quality control fails, proteins can clump to form aggregates, which then undergo autophagic degradation 2. Although vast amount of information regarding the cellular mechanism of soluble protein quality control is available, membrane proteins PQC process is poorly understood, especially in the context of how quality control factors coordinate to rectify the misfolded or aggregated membrane protein problem.",

The viruses, on the other hand trick these cues by either tuning or reprogramming their cellular role 3. Detailed understanding of these cues have paved way for the development of crucial antiviral targets and also helped us understand the basic cellular processes 4.

PQC pathway deploys powerful molecular chaperones that recognize and triage misfolded clients (Fig. 1, Step 1). Different chaperones possess distinct modes of substrate recognition that determine their substrate range and specificity 6. Among them the ubiquitous 70\u2010kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family of chaperones is shown to be associated with plethora of misfolded and aggregated substrates, possibly selecting their targets for proteasomal or autophagy degradation. The Hsp70's activity, in turn, is regulated by a number of cofactors and cochaperones, together functioning as a \u2018machine\u2019 7. For instance, J\u2010proteins prime the Hsp70's folding property by selecting and supplying the substrate to Hsp70 and also stimulate the Hsp70's ATPase activity, whereas nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) promote the exchange of ADP with ATP, to accelerate the cyclic reaction 8.

For instance, the ATP\u2010dependent refolding by chaperone binding and release involving Hsp70, a J\u2010protein, and a NEF is well defined for several soluble proteins 7. Among them the mostly widely understood are the model substrates processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. The cellular organelle ER is the most crowed environment in the cell performing diverse cellular roles. Any dysfunction in the ER activity leads to accumulation of misfolded and/or unfolded proteins. Cells maintain ER proteostasis by deploying diverse array of ER\u2010resident chaperones and enzymes, which process their client by correcting or priming them to degradative pathways. For example, in the case of misfolded secretory protein carboxypeptidase mutant CPY* and nonglycosylated pro\u2010\u03b1\u2010factor, the ER lumen Hsp70 called binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and its associated cochaperones efficiently process the misfolded proteins for ER\u2010associated degradation (ERAD) (Fig. 1, Step 3 & 4) 9.

Cells counteract these aggregates by sequestering them in special cytoplasmic quality control compartment (Fig. 1, Step 6) for refolding or autophagic degradation (Fig. 1, Step 7) 12. Partitioning of misfolded proteins into compartments is an organized process that appears to be conserved from yeast to mammalian cells.

For example, Hsp110 is shown to stabilize Apolipoprotein from undergoing ERAD 15; Hsp70 has been demonstrated to be transiently associated with polyQ protein aggregates, raising the possibility that it may be involved in disaggregating polyQ aggregates 16. Similarly, overexpression of several Hsp40 family proteins along with Hsp70 has been shown to prevent accumulation of polyQ ataxia\u20101/3 in inclusions 17. In the ER lumen, BiP prevents aggregation of a misfolded client by binding to its exposed hydrophobic patches until the client is delivered to the ERAD machinery 18.

Synthesis of the membrane proteins is a highly complex and error\u2010prone process, which includes insertion of membrane domain into the bilayer and organizing domains on either side of the membrane. Unsurprisingly, due to its complex organization, error in membrane protein synthesis, assembly, and delivery is associated with several diseases such as cystic fibrosis, retinitis pigmentosa, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, etc. Cells counteract this problem by deploying powerful PQC machineries analogous to soluble proteins with overlapping components and mechanisms. For instance, the ER\u2010resident ATP\u2010dependent quality control involving Hsp70/BiP, a J\u2010protein, and a NEF is defined for several membrane protein clients, such as rhodopsin 19, surfactant C 20, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), etc. In the case of \u0394F508 mutant of CFTR and gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone receptor, the ER membrane chaperone BAP31 21 and DnaJ B12 22 associate with their respective clients and promote its retrotranslocation and clearance from the ER.

Similar to soluble PQC compartments, increasing evidence indicates the existence of quality control structures for membrane proteins 24, but the formation and composition of these structures are poorly characterized. Recent studies have implicated requirement of certain PQC factors for the formation of these structures, including chaperones (Hsp70, DnaJB, Bag3), molecular motors, microtubules, and microtubule\u2010associated factors (histone deacetylase; HDAC6) 25, 26. However, the basic formation mechanism of these structures is vague. Moreover, the manners in which substrates are recognized and targeted to aggresomes leading to autophagy are not known. Recent studies have supported the notion of ER membrane chaperones playing pivotal role in recognition and fate of aberrant clients. For instance, membrane\u2010localized J\u2010protein B12 along with cytosolic Hsp70 is reported as a potential factor for membrane client recognition 27, 28. Another Hsp70 cochaperone, Bag3, was also reported to be involved in targeting misfolded client to the quality control sites for further processing 26. Also, an unbiased RNAi screening analysis toward aggresome substrate (synphilin\u20101) has identified RuvbL proteins as aggresome\u2010forming proteins with disaggregase activity 29. In addition, little is understood about the underlying mechanism of retrotranslocation of membrane clients during ERAD, with several groups suggesting direct interplay of membrane channels Hrd1 and Derlin\u20101 in client selection and retrotranslocation 30, 31.",

Specifically, the PDI family of enzymes reduces and isomerizes the viral disulfide bonds that often expose hydrophobic epitopes 32, 33. These changes partially disassemble the virus and the particle now mimics a giant misfolded protein aggregate, which now recruits Hsp70 homolog BiP and its luminal cochaperones 34, 35. The restructured, hydrophobic virus is primed for membrane penetration, by exploiting molecular motor kinesin\u20101 to drive the reorganization of ER membrane chaperone B14 to form the virus membrane penetration site, called \u2018focus\u2019 36. The focus\u2010localized virus is then extracted from the membrane by a B14\u2010tethered cytosolic disaggregation machinery (B14, Hsc70, and Hsp110), consequently reaching the cytosol 37.

Another example of an enveloped virus taking advantage of host PQC factors is in the case of Vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypic poxvirus. VACV has evolved a complex multistep core disassembly and genome release process due to its shape and structure. After \u2018core activation\u2019, host proteasome activity is required for core degradation and genome release 41.

Numerous viruses exploit host PQC factors to build site of replication and promote assembly. Several members of Flaviviridae family are reported to indirectly utilize ER membrane chaperones to build and sustain their replication site. For instance, during Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, virus induces ER membrane rearrangement to form a viral replication factory. Although, several chaperones (Hsp70, Hsp90, and calnexin) are implicated to play a role in virus replication, the exact composition and mechanism of replication factory formation is poorly defined and proposed to be closely related to PQC 42. Similarly, recent study on Dengue virus (DENV) has illuminated the requirement of Hsp70 chaperone network that are required at distinct steps of the viral cycle, including entry, RNA replication, and virion biogenesis. More importantly, the role of Hsp70 at each step is specified by nine distinct DNAJ cofactors 43. Of these, DnaJB11 relocalizes to virus\u2010induced replication complex, while DnaJB6 facilitates virion biogenesis. Studies on recently emerged Zika virus (ZIKV) has demonstrated widespread remodeling of intracellular membrane and formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles. Several ER and cytosolic chaperones are implicated in formation of these vacuoles, but a thorough understanding is needed to reveal the importance and formation of these vacuoles 44.
