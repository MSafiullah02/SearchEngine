The COVID-19 epidemic is a public-health emergency, and has spread rapidly and widely. Being highly contagious, SARS-CoV-2 has many transmission routes. A specific treatment for COVID-2 is lacking. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 poses a huge threat to life and health, and can lead to tension and anxiety. During the COVID-19 epidemic, if children must be hospitalized when they are sick, a densely populated hospital is a high-risk area for virus-borne infections. Simultaneously, children's immunity is low, so the possibility of infection is greater than that for adults. Parents will also worry that they may get infected in hospital. Also, children are curious about life. During hospitalization, if parents or physicians do not pay sufficient attention, children may touch various items randomly, leading to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Therefore, the parents of children hospitalized during the COVID-19 epidemic face huge pressure and anxiety. Post-traumatic stress disorder and mental-health problems may occur in parents, which may affect the child's recovery. Hence, early detection of the mental health of such parents, and timely provision of certain psychologic interventions, will help parents take better care of their children in hospital, and help children recover and be discharged from hospital as soon as possible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dear editor,"}, {"text": "I have made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112953", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Author statement"}, {"text": "Psychiatry Research 288 (2020) 112953 Available online 13 April 2020 0165-1781/ \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
