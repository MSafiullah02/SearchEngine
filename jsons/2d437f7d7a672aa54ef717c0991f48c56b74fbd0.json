This article reviews information linking HRV infection to illness in the lower respiratory tract. HRVs are capable of efficient replication in vitro at temperatures present in the tracheobronchial tree and have been shown to cause productive infection, elaboration of cytokines and chemokines, and upregulation of cell surface markers in human bronchial epithelial cells. In situ hybridisation studies have proven that HRV infection occurs in the tracheobronchial tree following experimental infection. Clinical studies report that HRV infection is the second most frequently recognised agent associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children and commonly causes exacerbations of pre-existing airways disease in those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis. HRV infection is associated with one-third to one-half of asthma exacerbations depending on age and is linked to asthma hospitalisations in both adults and children. Limited information implicates HRV infection as a cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in older adults and in highly immunocompromised hosts, particularly bone marrow transplant recipients. More information is needed about the pathogenesis of HRV infection with regard to lower respiratory tract complications in these diverse patient groups. Given the large unmet medical need associated with HRV infections, safe and effective antiviral agents are needed for both prevention and treatment of these infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infections in both adults and children. In adults, HRV infections account for approximately 50% of common colds on an annual basis and up to 80% or more during the high prevalence autumn period in the northern hemisphere [1, 2] . Large epidemiological studies report a higher incidence of infections in children than adults [3] and almost all children have experienced at least one HRV infection by age 2 years [4] . Reports from the 1960s associated HRV infections with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (Table 1) and also described croup, bronchitis and bronchopneumonia in children with HRV infection. One early report suggested that HRVs could cause atypical pneumonia in young adults [5] . More recent evidence increasingly indicates that HRV infections are important causes of exacerbations of multiple types of pre-existing airways disorders and can directly invade the lower respiratory tract to cause disease.

The illness manifested as tracheobronchitis in six (75%) with frequent coughing, substernal chest pain, tracheal tenderness, and in two instances, wheezing. In comparison, coryzal illness was common but tracheobronchitis occurred in only two (7%) of 31 volunteers after intranasal inocula-tion by coarse spray or drops. Other early clinical observations linked rhinovirus infections to exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults [7] and acute wheezy bronchitis in children [8] . These studies [72] (43%) also documented recovery of rhinovirus from sputum samples more often than from upper respiratory tract samples. For example, one prospective 30-month study of 15 chronic bronchitis patients found that one-half of colds were preceded or followed by exacerbations [7] . Rhinoviruses were recovered from nasal washings, throat swabs and/or sputum in 23% of 47 illnesses affecting the chest; they were isolated from sputum in five instances, including three for which throat swab samples were negative, and in titres as high as 10 4 TCID 50 /ml [7] .

During quiet breathing of room air (26.7 C), the mean inspiratory temperatures gradually increased from 33.2 C at the carina to 35.5 C distally. High levels of ventilation or quiet breathing of very cold air (\u00c018.6 C) were associated with up to approximately 3 -4 C decreases in temperatures at proximal sites.

Exposure of the human respiratory epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (derived from bronchial epithelium transformed by an adenovirus 12-SV40 hybrid virus), to rhinovirus 14 resulted in productive viral replication for at least 72 h and increased production of IL-8, IL-6 and GM-CSF without effects on cell viability [12] . IL-8 elaboration was maximal at 24 h, about 3-fold higher than in controls, and correlated with viral titres. Cytokine release required active replication, in that inhibition of viral infection by antibody to ICAM-1 or use of UV light-inactivated virus blocked IL-8 increases. Infection was inefficient, not associated with changes in ICAM-1 expression, enhanced by pre-exposure to TNF-alpha and decreased by exposure to IFN-alpha or gamma. Exposure of A549 cells (a transformed human alveolar cell line) to rhinovirus 9 resulted in noncytolytic, productive infection and prolonged increases in IL-8 release [13] . Replication was nonsustained with peak titres of <2 log 10 TCID 50 at Rhinovirus and lower respiratory tract Rhinovirus and lower respiratory tract 19 19 24 h, but IL-8 release continued up to 5 days after infection. Prevention of HRV receptor binding with soluble ICAM-1 completely blocked replication and cytokine release, whereas exposure to UV light-inactivated virus decreased release by about 50%. Several HRV serotypes have been shown to replicate in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, to cause cytopathic effect under certain conditions, and to induce production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, GM-CSF and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted) [11, 14] . For HRV type 16, the magnitude and kinetics of ex vivo replication were found to be similar in primary adenoidal and bronchial epithelial cells, although infection occurred much less often in both cell types compared with HeLa cells [15] . Consistent with the finding of scanty foci of replication in nasal mucosal biopsies by in situ hybridisation following experimental infection of humans [16] , viral infection was documented by infectious center and immunohistochemical assays in less than 10% of exposed cells, despite the use of very high viral inocula. One explanation for this low proportion of infected cells may be the finding of a less efficient eclipse mechanism, that is less uncoating of attached virus, perhaps due to a paucity of ICAM-1 receptors on the surface of bronchial epithelial cells [15] . Inflammatory conditions, including HRV infection itself [17] which up-regulate ICAM-1 expression could theoretically enhance the likelihood of lower respiratory tract replication or perhaps even foster initial infection following inhalation of droplets into the lower respiratory tract.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1147, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1303, "text": "19 19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1837, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1841, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2081, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2240, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2657, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2716, "end": 2720, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Replication in respiratory cells in vitro"}, {"text": "During naturally occurring colds it is likely that the lower respiratory tract is inoculated with infectious droplets from the upper airway possibly during bouts of coughing or sneezing and during sleep. Studies of experimentally infected volunteers suggest that HRV replicates in the lower airways, usually without visible changes in the bronchial mucosa. The possibility of contamination from the upper airway cannot be excluded in some studies. Following experimental infection by intranasal instillation of virus, HRV was cultured from protected bronchial brush samples of 5 of 13 (38%) subjects who had positive nasal samples [18] . All five had clinical illness including cough and the bronchoscopy specimen titres were similar to those observed in nasal brush samples; virus was not recovered at bronchoscopy from five infected volunteers without illness. Following inoculation by both intranasal instillation and large particle aerosols, HRV RNA has been detected in lower airway secretions and cells by RT-PCR [19] and directly by in situ hybridisation [14] . In eight allergic volunteers inoculated intranasally and by coarse aerosol with HRV 16, viral RNA was detected in nasal lavages and lower airway cells at 2-4 days after infection in all subjects [19] . RNA was detected by the RT-PCR assay in only three of eight acellular BAL samples in comparison to 21 of 26 airway cellular samples, which suggested that HRV16 was largely cell-associated and that the positive results were less likely to be due to contamination from the upper airway. In ten adults experimentally inoculated with HRV by intranasal drops and aerosols, the replicative form of viral RNA was detected in bronchial epithelial biopsies of four subjects [14] . Such findings establish that HRV replication can occur in the lower airways, although the frequency, duration and extent of direct viral involvement and its pathogenetic consequences remain to be defined under natural circumstances. Whether rhinoviruses can replicate in alveolar pneumocytes also remains to be established. However, in 9 experimentally infected healthy volunteers, bronchial biopsy specimens showed 9-fold increases in 5-lipoxygenase positive cells, increased numbers of cyclooxygenase positive cells, and 3-4fold increases in macrophages and mast cells, as well as doubling of BAL fluid cysteinyl leukotriene levels [20] .

For example, one prospective 4year study including 1068 children and adults hospitalised with various acute respiratory illnesses found HRV infection by virus isolation from nose and/or throat swabs in 4.3% of children <5 years, 6.0% of those aged 5-35 years and 2.4% of adults aged >35 years [21] . The most common diagnoses in young children were asthma, bronchiolitis, possible sepsis and pneumonia. Asthma was the principal reason for admission in those aged 5-35 years, whereas pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD) exacerbation and asthma were the admitting diagnoses in the older adults, in whom the average length of hospital stay was 6 days. This and many other studies utilised virus isolation for detection of HRV infections and thus underestimated their contribution. The impact of HRV infections has also been underestimated because many studies were conducted outside high HRV prevalence periods or for short periods of observation. Although HRVs cause infections year-round, the peak prevalence periods are the early fall and late spring months in the northern hemisphere [3] . Consequently, studies focusing on the winter months do not accurately reflect the relative contribution of HRVs to illness on an annual basis. For example, HRV RNA was detected in only 1.9% of 719 adults presenting with influenza-like illness (fever and respiratory plus systemic symptoms) during one influenza season, although it was found in 19% of such illnesses among a subset of 78 persons in whom no other aetiology was established by standard methods [22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 412, "end": 416, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1257, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1722, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF LOWER AIRWAYS DISEASE"}, {"text": "Appreciation of the epidemiological and clinical importance of HRV infections has been enhanced by more sensitive viral diagnostic tests, specifically application of RT-PCR testing.

A single winter season study (November-April) of elderly adults (aged ! 65 years) hospitalised with a clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory illness including pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, bronchitis or CHF found evidence of HRV infection by RT-PCR in five of 100 randomly selected nasopharyngeal samples from patients who were negative for influenza or RSV infection [44] . Two of the five had radiographically proven pneumonia, but all recovered and were discharged after an average 8-day hospitalisation. All patients had significant underlying medical problems, principally severe COPD and CHF. However, a prospective 4-year study of 417 adults aged !45 years who were hospitalised with acute respiratory illness in association with various underlying conditions found culture-positive HRV infection in only 2.2% [45] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 448, "end": 452, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 802, "end": 806, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1446, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1822, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2271, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adult bronchitis and pneumonia"}, {"text": "Many studies of both children and adults have linked HRV infection to exacerbations of asthma (Table 1) , although the frequency of HRV detection has depended heavily on the sensitivity of the laboratory methods [46] . One longitudinal 13month study of 108 children aged 9-11 years examining the relationship between exacerbations of asthma and viral infection found 292 reported respiratory illness episodes (mean, 2.5 per childyear), in which picornavirus infection was detected in 147 (50%) [26] . Most were detected by RT-PCR and were proven or likely to be HRVs. Overall a virus infection was found in about 80% of reported illnesses with lower respiratory manifestations (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath) or falls in peak expiratory flow rates. The median delay between onset of respiratory symptoms and decreases in peak expiratory flow rates was only 1 day; the delay was 2 or more days in 46% of those presenting with upper respiratory symptoms. Such findings indicate that the time window for therapeutic intervention to prevent exacerbations after the onset of respiratory symptoms is narrow. A follow-up analysis documented strong correlations between the seasonal patterns of viral respiratory infections and asthma hospitalisations for both children and adults [47] . Upper respiratory illnesses and asthma admissions were both more common during school attendance than during breaks; peaks were associated with new school terms and HRV infections were associated with all of the four peaks in admissions identified during this 1-year study. A recent study of 179 asthmatic children hospitalized with exacerbations during two winter and two spring/summer seasons detected HRV RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates in 79%, a significantly greater proportion than the observed frequencies of 17% in 29 asymptomatic asthmatic children and 52% in 50 nonasthmatic ambulatory children with upper respiratory tract illness [27] . Another study of 81 children less than 2 years of age who were hospitalised with wheezing found HRV RNA in 33% and enterovirus RNA in 12%; HRV was the sole pathogen in 81% of 27 positive patients, and it was most common in those aged 12-17 months (65% of children) [48] . HRV infection was associated with atopic dermatitis in infancy, and follow-up at approximately 6 years found a possible association between HRV infection at the initial admission and subsequent diagnosis of early school-age asthma.

In contrast to healthy subjects, those with asthma continued to show eosinophilic infiltration on repeat biopsies 6-8 weeks after infection. The chemokine IL-8 may play a critical role in both eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment and activation in HRV-associated asthma exacerbations. In asthmatic children with virus-induced exacerbations predominately due to HRV infection, increased nasal lavage levels of IL-8 and neutrophil myeloperoxidase are correlated with each other and with the severity of upper respiratory symptoms [58] . Similarly, increased nasal lavage levels of IL-8 were correlated with bronchial hyper-reactivity in experimental HRV infections of asthmatic adults [59] . Such observations suggest that IL-8 might be a target for therapeutic intervention. Viral infections also potentiate the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictive responses to inhaled allergens. Allergic subjects experimentally infected with HRV develop both immediate and late allergic responses with increased BAL histamine concentrations after segmental allergen challenge, in contrast to uninfected subjects or those without allergy [60] . Bronchoconstriction can also follow altered neural control including enhanced parasympathetic responses and other mechanisms [55] . Viral infections may cause reduced activity of the enzyme-neutral endopeptidase that inactivates tachykinins, a group of peptide transmitters produced in sensory nerves that result in bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, glandular secretion and leukocyte influx [56] . Airway parasympathetic neurons also produce eotaxin which attracts eosinophils. Infections can augment vagally mediated bronchoconstriction through multiple mechanisms including inhibition of the expression and action of the M2 muscarinic receptors inhibitory for M3 receptor mediated constriction. Major basic protein from eosinophils also blocks the function of M2 receptors. With respect to treatment, corticosteroids can increase M2 receptor activity, and topical anticholinergics, specifically ipratropium bromide, can provide therapeutic benefit in acute exacerbations [56] . However, one placebo-controlled study in 104 school-aged asthmatic or atopic children found no prophylactic benefit of inhaled corticosteroids in ameliorating episodes of reduced expiratory flow or of lower respiratory tract illness during 6 months of dosing [61] . Viral aetiology studies were not determined in this study. Another placebo-controlled study of inhaled corticosteroid prophylaxis in a small number of atopic adults found no significant effects on the number of inflammatory cells in bronchial biopsy specimens following experimental HRV infection [62] .

Wide disparities exist in HRV detection rates among studies examining acute respiratory illness and exacerbations of COPD; the differences relate in part to differences in virologic methods and the populations studied. Older prospective studies of COPD patients, which employed virus culture as the means for HRV detection, found that approximately 14%-43% of exacerbations were associated with HRV infection [63] . One 10-month trial [64] collected nasal washings and throat swabs monthly and at the time of respiratory illness from 34 chronic bronchitis patients and from 19 control subjects. HRV infection was found in 14.3% and 19.0% of samples during acute respiratory illnesses, respectively, in each group and in 2.1% and 1.1% of samples during periods of quiescence, respectively. Exacerbations occurred in about 90% of the bronchitics with respiratory illness, and 68% of 56 exacerbations were associated with upper respiratory symptoms. Such results indicate that patients with chronic bronchitis are not more susceptible to HRV infection but that such infections are more likely to be associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms, a conclusion supported by comparable findings in COPD [65] and asthma patients (discussed above). A similar study of patients with moderate to severe obstructive airway disease employed prospective cultures of throat samples during clinic visits and Rhinovirus and lower respiratory tract Rhinovirus and lower respiratory tract 25 25 found that HRVs were recovered in 43% of exacerbations and that 78% of HRV isolations were associated with an exacerbation [63] . Another 3-year prospective study in patients with COPD cultured rhinoviruses from 6.1% of illnesses studied, making it the most common virus identified, and found that 88% of HRV isolations were associated with illness [66] . HRV infections were associated with cough (71% of episodes) but, unlike influenza, not with deterioration in forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ) measurements [67] . A more recent study in adults with COPD utilised serology and culture for virus over an average 26 month follow-up period and found that respiratory illnesses were more common in those with COPD but that such illnesses were less often associated with proven viral infections (19%) than in controls with ARI (39%) [65] . Picornaviruses accounted for 23% and 31% of the documented viral infections in the COPD and controls, respectively. Only one hospitalisation was associated with HRV infection. One 2.5 year prospective study of 101 moderatesevere COPD patients found that 35% of 504 exacerbations were associated with common colds and 12% with sore throat at onset [69] . The presence of cold symptoms at the onset of exacerbations was associated with both significant decreases in PEFR and more protracted recovery. Only 75% of all exacerbations had returned to baseline lung function by 5 weeks follow-up. Corticosteroids but not antibiotic therapy appeared to benefit the rate of PEFR recovery; neither significantly affected symptom recovery. A follow-up study utilising RT-PCR for HRV detection found that 64% of exacerbations were associated with colds occurring up to 18 days beforehand and that HRV was detected in 23% of 168 exacerbations and in 58% of identified viral infections [25] . Viral infections were associated with slower recovery time (median, 13 versus 6 days) and higher plasma fibrinogen and IL-6 levels than episodes without virus detected. Because colds have been associated with more protracted recovery, corticosteroids have been proposed as early treatment of COPD exacerbations associated with colds [69] . However, corticosteroids have also been shown to enhance HRV replication in the upper respiratory tract during colds [70, 71] , so that it will be important to assess whether their use affects HRV replication in the lower airways during exacerbations of preexisting airways disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 504, "end": 508, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 530, "end": 534, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1299, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1574, "text": "25 25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1702, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1928, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2091, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2411, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2761, "end": 2765, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3386, "end": 3390, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3726, "end": 3730, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3850, "end": 3854, "text": "[70,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 3855, "end": 3858, "text": "71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}, {"text": "Studies relying on cell culture isolation have detected low frequencies of viral infection in cystic fibrosis patients, possibly related to technical difficulties in recovering virus from tenacious mucoid secretions.

Our retrospective analysis of 431 virus-positive BAL or bronchial biopsy cultures over a 10-year period at an academic medical centre identified 28 (7%) that were HRV-positive; HRV represented the third most common virus detected after CMV (64% of positive samples) and HSV (21%) [74] . These positives occurred in 20 hospitalised patients aged 2.5-86 years, all of whom had acute respiratory illness, abnormal chest radiographs, and the presence of an immunosuppressing condition (including solid organ transplantation in 35%, malignancy in 20% and AIDS in 10%) and/or immunosuppressive therapy (90%). Leukopenia was present in 30%. One lung transplant recipient had intermittent recovery of HRV from respiratory samples over a 15-week period, although attempts to detect HRV RNA in 26 26 F. G. Hayden F. G. Hayden bronchial biopsies were unsuccessful [74] . Other pathogens were detected in 70% of patients including fungi in 45%, bacteria in 40%, and other viruses in 25%. Histopathologic abnormalities were found in seven of 13 biopsies, and two biopsies from patients without other recognised infections showed acute inflammation with fibropurulent debris in alveoli. Detection of HRV was associated with a poor prognosis; 60% of the patients were cared for in an intensive care unit and 25% died during that hospitalisation. The findings suggested that HRV infection could be associated with severe lower respiratory tract disease in some highly immunocompromised patients. The frequency of HRV infections and risk factors for lower respiratory tract disease in transplant recipients have not been well characterised. An 8-year prospective study of marrow and stem cell transplant patients identified 31 patients with HRV infection, representing one-quarter of community respiratory viral infections [75] . BAL was performed routinely for radiographic evidence of pneumonia. In 28 of 29 instances (97%) the isolate was obtained from the upper respiratory tract, and only one BAL was positive for HRV. These findings suggested that HRV infections rarely caused lower respiratory tract disease, although the timing of these infections in relation to transplantation was not delineated [75] . A 7-year study of lung transplant recipients which obtained routine BAL specimens after transplantation found that six of seven patients with HRV detection were symptom free, although three had evidence for rejection or organising pneumonia [68] . In contrast, another prospective 5-year study in adult blood and marrow transplant recipients who were undergoing conditioning or were myelosuppressed before engraftment identified 22 HRV infections among approximately 2000 persons ($ 1%) undergoing transplantation [76] . HRV infections accounted for about 8% of persons with acute respiratory illness. All presented with manifestations of upper respiratory illness within 10 days after transplantation, and 64% of infections were nosocomially acquired following 7-22 days of hospitalisation. These illnesses occurred sporadically throughout the year without seasonal predominance. In 15 patients the illness remained uncomplicated, although associated with a high frequency of fever (47%), and lasted an average of 14 days. In seven (34%) patients the infection was complicated by pneumonia and death due to progressive respiratory failure. Fever (86%), wheezing (57%), and dyspnoea (71%) were common in these patients. The mean time from onset of respiratory symptoms until ventilatory support was 12 days (range, 3-21 days), and HRV was cultured from antemortem BAL or tracheal aspirate in six of seven patients. In five autopsies, four showed findings consistent with viral pneumonia, including interstitial pneumonitis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome with diffuse alveolar damage, congestion and hyaline membranes. One autopsy revealed invasive aspergillosis but the other four found no other pathogens in the lung, although three of four had other serious infections antemortem. An important issue in these patients was the extent to which chemotherapy-or radiationinduced pulmonary damage and/or myelosuppression might have predisposed to the development of pneumonia [76] , although the findings suggested that infection early post-transplant had increased risk of an unfavourable outcome. A recent retrospective analysis of 77 marrow transplant recipients with pneumonia during one respiratory season identified eight BAL samples (6% of 122 tested) in six patients (8%) that were positive for HRV RNA by RT-PCR [77] . The samples were collected an average of 151 days posttransplant, indicating that almost all were community acquired infections. In two patients repeat BAL samples were positive at intervals of 31 and 44 days after the initial positive one, which raised the possibility of prolonged lower respiratory tract replication. The fatality rate in HRV-infected patients was 83% but all of them had significant co-infections. The mean time from respiratory illness onset to death was 54 days; no autopsy data were obtained. The available evidence indicates that HRV may be associated with lower respiratory tract disease in highly immunocompromised marrow transplant recipients, frequent co-infections and often poor prognosis. However, the contribution of HRV to overall pathogenesis remains uncertain with regard to causing direct viral damage or predisposition to secondary invaders. The timing of infection in relation to transplantation and type of transplant may be an important variable with regard to severity of disease, and more data are needed from both HSCT and solid organ, particularly lung transplant recipients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 493, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 993, "end": 998, "text": "26 26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2019, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2398, "end": 2402, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2646, "end": 2650, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2919, "end": 2923, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 4390, "end": 4394, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 4735, "end": 4739, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunocompromised hosts"}, {"text": "Rhinovirus and lower respiratory tract Rhinovirus and lower respiratory tract 27 27 Implications for antiviral use", "cite_spans": [{"start": 78, "end": 83, "text": "27 27", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunocompromised hosts"}, {"text": "The considerable burden of HRV infections with respect to both upper and lower respiratory tract disorders highlights the medical need for effective interventions. Unfortunately, no safe and effective HRV-specific antiviral agents are currently available for treatment or prevention of HRV illness. An important limitation of the available data regarding HRV infection in most target populations is the lack of information regarding viral dynamics, specifically quantitative infectious viral levels at different sites (upper versus lower respiratory tract) and time points in illness. Consequently, the importance of ongoing viral replication in disease pathogenesis has not been defined for most of the lower respiratory syndromes associated with HRV. In this regard, controlled studies with selective antiviral agents would be helpful in assessing the contribution of HRV infections to lower respiratory tract disease in many target groups. Prevention of HRV infections by antiviral chemoprophylaxis or other control measures (e.g. handwashing) would be expected to reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract illness, particularly in those with underlying conditions. In contrast, given the short time between onset of colds and exacerbation of pre-existing airways diseases, it is unclear whether early treatment could prevent such exacerbations. Whether antiviral treatment might modify an established exacerbation of asthma or COPD would depend heavily on the extent of HRV replication and its role in promoting deleterious host responses. Combinations of antiviral and interventions directed at such host responses would seem to offer the highest likelihood of therapeutic success.

While nasal application of antivirals is protective in immunocompetent adults, it remains to be determined whether delivery to the lower respiratory tract is important for prophylactic efficacy in those with pre-existing airways disorders.
