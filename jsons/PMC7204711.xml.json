            "text": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been widely used in clinics for a variety of pathologies, such as dermatological and ophthalmic diseases and cancers. According to the \u201cWorld Cancer Report 2014\u201d, the number of cancer cases in 2025 will increase to 19 million per year and 24 million by 2030, while the number of deaths will increase from 8.2 to 13 million per year [1]. Therefore, it is crucial to search for new materials and methods that can contribute to cancer treatment. PDT usually reveals fewer side effects than standard therapies. Moreover, this kind of therapy is accompanied by a lesser amount of resistance expressed by cancer cells [2]. Similarly, PDT used against microorganisms also constitutes a prospective for antimicrobial therapy. So far, no specific microbial resistance has been reported for antimicrobial PDT, even after repeated treatments with low doses of photosensitizers [3], [4]. The basis for PDT is a photodynamic reaction, which requires three essential factors: the photosensitizer, oxygen, and light. The photodynamic effect is triggered by the excitation of the photosensitizer with light. The excited photosensitizer reacts with oxygen thus generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2), free radicals, and peroxides. ROS appearing in the tissue in a controlled way during PDT can be applied in the treatment of certain types of cancers and precancerous lesions [5], [6].",

            "text": "Although photodynamic therapy has been used for years, there is still a demand for novel, useful and safe photosensitizers. The most studied photosensitizers for medical applications are porphyrinoids with zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) being an example [7]. ZnPc, although a 1st generation photosensitizer, has been widely studied in PDT due to its high quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation, low toxicity, and a strong absorbance in the red light region allowing for a deeper tissue permeability [8], [9]. Despite some success in the treatment of cancer, ZnPc reveals some limitations, most notably related to its hydrophobic nature. This property leads to poor solubility of the photosensitizer molecules and causes aggregation in the biological media. Another limitation pertains to the partial retention of the photosensitizer in healthy cells or difficult excretion of the photosensitizer from normal tissues [10]. All the aspects mentioned above lead to a significant decrease in PDT efficiency. This issue can be solved by the application of magnetic nanoparticles, which offer many advantages allowing for the optimization of photosensitizer administration and, thus, improvement of PDT protocol [11].",

            "text": "The last decade has witnessed an extremely rapid development of nanotechnology in various branches of science, especially in medicine and pharmacy, including pharmaceutical technology and medicinal chemistry [12]. The so-called nanomedicine is based on the use of nanomaterials, mainly nanoparticles, in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Nanomaterials have been studied for these particular therapeutic and diagnostic applications due to their possessing some specific properties, such as small size, biocompatibility, wide chemical affinity, non-toxicity, and also a broad range of prospective modifications, which would allow a further increase in their desired functionality [13]. In PDT, the magnetic properties of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles can be applied for the improvement to the localization of the therapeutic agents in tumor cells [14]. A combined therapy, using photoactive compounds and non-toxic nanoparticles, can be considered as interesting modality aiming to meet this challenge. According to literature reports, the combination of PDT and magnetic hyperthermia is an effective approach and may enhance the therapeutic effect, therefore enabling significant tumor regression [15], [16], [17]. It should also be noted that magnetic nanoparticles based on magnetite, that present superparamagnetic properties, constitute a particular class of nanomaterials. Pure magnetite, however, reveals colloidal instability, especially in neutral pH; thus, its suspensions require a specific stabilization and surface modification [18].",

            "text": "That being said, the coating of magnetite with macromolecules, in particular with polymers, allows for easy surface design. Such modification triggers its further utility, especially in comparison with the coatings of a low molecular weight [19]. It goes without saying the materials applied in biomedicine and pharmacy should express good biocompatibility and be non-toxic. Therefore, it is worth noting that these criteria are fulfilled by some polysaccharide polymers, such as chitosan, starch, or dextran [10]. Polysaccharides comprise a large family of naturally occurring polymeric carbohydrates. Their high chemical reactivity, as well as easy modification, are among the desired features of these molecules. Polysaccharide-based coatings offer many advantages, such as high biocompatibility with human body fluids. According to the latest reports, materials based on polysaccharides can also be utilized in the fight against viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 coronavirus disease responsible for the global pandemic outbreak in 2020 [20]. Levan (Lev), a natural polysaccharide, is a promising material for use in pharmaceutical technology due to its outstanding physicochemical properties, like low viscosity, compatibility with salts and surfactants, and high loading capacity for water and chemicals [21], [22]. Furthermore, this type of fructan exhibits a strong antioxidant effect and offers protection against oxidative stress associated with atherosclerosis. In addition, it is biodegradable, non-toxic, and presents the ability to form adhesion bonds with various compounds due to a large number of hydroxyl groups in the structure. Lev (Fig.1\n) appears in several microorganisms and consists of glycosidic \u03b2-(2,6) major and \u03b2-(1,2) minor linkages. The isolated microbial levan has a molecular weight of less than 100 million Da [23], [24]. Interestingly, Lev was also studied as an antitumor agent [22]. In the literature, various polysaccharides coating magnetic nanoparticles have been so far described, such as chitosan, starch, dextran, and sodium alginate [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], but to our best knowledge, there have been no reports presenting the surface modification of magnetic nanoparticles with levan [30].",

Grafting ZnPc on the levan-coated nanoparticles surface (Lev-Fe3O4), thus forming Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4, allows the understanding of the nature of the surface covering the magnetic core of the Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This specific step being essential to further facilitate the improvement of PDT. Structure and morphology of the Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4 nanoparticles were studied with the Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR), Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM, TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis-differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA) methods. The size of nanomaterials was studied using TEM and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method. The properties of the nanoparticles were examined in terms of magnetization and the ability to produce singlet oxygen in an aqueous medium, which are necessary for the effectiveness of PDT-hyperthermia combined therapy. Finally, the preliminary toxicity of neat levan and all prepared nanoparticles were studied both under and without light irradiation using Microtox\u00ae test, which has been so far applied for the toxicity assessment of many porphyrazine and phthalocyanine photosensitizers [4], [31], [32], [33], [34].",

In the Scopus database, the data concerning \u201cmagnetic nanoparticles coated with levan\u201d did not yield any results as for 29th February 2020 [30]. It is worth noting that levan-coated magnetic nanoparticles (Lev-Fe3O4) were obtained as a new magnetic material for the first time in the herein presented study. The Lev-Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation of ferric and ferrous ions in the alkaline solution (pH=14). For Lev coating, the epichlorohydrin was selected as a crosslinking agent due to the hydroxyl groups present in levan molecules. Initial research indicated that the obtained levan-coated magnetic nanoparticles might become the basis of a new system for binary selective anticancer therapy. Next, the levan-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were combined with zinc(II) phthalocyanine (Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4) to give a complex system. Due to the presence of zinc(II) phthalocyanine photosensitizer, the deposition of ZnPc on Lev-Fe3O4 nanoparticles was carried out in the absence of light. The synthetic strategy for the preparation of the Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4 nanoparticles is presented in Figure 2\n. It seemed that it would be possible to strengthen the antitumor effect by the combination of magnetic hyperthermia and clinically approved photodynamic therapy (PDT), which are known to induce a relatively good anticancer response independently.",

The absorption bands appearing at 1123 cm-1, 1012 cm-1 and 925 cm-1, represent the C\u2212O\u2212C symmetric bending vibrations of fructofuranose rings and glycosidic linkages [42]. In the ZnPc spectrum, the characteristic bands over the region 430\u20131600 cm\u22121 were revealed. The bands at 1283 cm-1, 1162 cm-1, 1058 cm-1, and 748 cm-1 were assigned to the stretching vibrations within ZnPc macrocycle. A band at 1114 cm\u22121 corresponds to the in-phase stretching of Zn-N bond coupled with benzene ring expansion, whereas a band at 1328 cm\u22121 is due to in-phase Zn-N stretching coupled with benzene ring deformation. The band at 1482 cm\u22121 is the result of the C-N-C bridge stretching [43], [44]. For Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, there were observed O-H vibration bands from the fructofuranose rings at 3257 cm-1 and C-H stretching vibration at 2878 cm-1 from the fructose rings. Furthermore, the bands observed at 1383 cm-1 and 1414 cm-1 were assigned to the C-N-C groups of the photosensitizer. All these bands confirmed the presence of the levan and zinc(II) phthalocyanine in the hybrid material. Moreover, the signal at 574 cm-1 corresponds to the Fe-O group of magnetite [45].",

The nitrogen isotherms only for Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4 sample resulted in type-IV shape. The hysteresis loop in the range of 0.4\u20130.98 relative pressure represents the H2 type (according to IUPAC classification). The H2 hysteresis contains more complex pore networks consisting of pores with ill-defined shape and wide pore size distribution. The specific surface areas were calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface adsorption method and were 2.5 m2 g-1\n, 5.6 m2 g-1, 9.5 m2 g-1, and 93.2 m2 g-1 for Lev, Lev-ZnPc, Lev-Fe3O4, and Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4, respectively. Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4 presents the highest surface area as compared to other nonporous materials. The pore size distribution curve was calculated using a non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) method and was depicted in Fig. 6b.

The results obtained for levan, ZnPc, and the magnetic nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 8\nand listed in Table 1\n. As shown in Fig. 8, levan, and zinc(II) phthalocyanine underwent two degradation stages. At the first stage of levan degradation, approximately 9% of the initial weight loss occurred between 20 and 115\u00b0C, due to the loss of moisture content. The main decomposition of Lev was observed between 190\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C, with 69% weight loss. It is probably caused by the breaking of the main chain linkages, as well as the breaking of bonds in the ring units. The first step in the decomposition of the zinc(II) phthalocyanine started in the range between 20-470\u00b0C and was associated with about 10% weight loss. The second stage related to the main decomposition of ZnPc appeared about 470\u00b0C. The 45% weight loss in this stage corresponds to the loss and fragmentation of the one unit present in the peripheral environment of the phthalocyanine molecule. The results obtained for both compounds are well-correlated with the literature data [51], [52], [53], [54].",

The obtained results indicated that the deposition of photosensitizer in levan layer increases the tensile strength, Young\u2019s modulus, and elongation compared with pure levan film. The Young\u2019s modulus of Lev-ZnPc composite is 25% greater than that of neat levan, the elongation is 61% greater, and the tensile strength is approximately doubled. According to X. Chen [54], the neat levan films revealed poor mechanical properties, with toughness lower than 2 MPa and elongation of 2.21%, due to a highly branched and compact structure of levan that prevented significant intermolecular entanglement. The addition of zinc (II) phthalocyanine to the levan layer had a positive effect on levan\u2019s mechanical properties. Therefore, despite the previously proposed application of such kind of hybrid material for anticancer PDT, it can also be applied for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. Especially in dentistry, it can be relevant to endodontic treatment, where temporary dressings are used to disinfect dentine tubules [57]. Another possible application of the hybrid material concerns pharmaceutical technology and the preparation of dressings for the treatment of skin lesions [58].",

The UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 10b) of the sample and DPBF blank in DMF solution were measured at ten-seconds intervals under a LED irradiation. The absorbance of the applied quencher at 409 nm decreased almost to zero in the presence of the prepared magnetic nanoparticles under irradiation. In comparison, the absorbance band at 670 nm remained unchanged, thus indicating the photostability and effective mediation of singlet oxygen generation by Lev-ZnPc-Fe3O4. The singlet oxygen quantum yield of the reference ZnPc is \u0278\u0394=0.56 [39]. The singlet oxygen quantum yield measured for the obtained nanomaterial is \u0278\u0394=0.41, which is 71% the value obtained for the standard. The quantum yields vary in the range of 0.3\u20130.8 for most photosensitizers, which means that the obtained value of \u0278\u0394 is relatively high. Moreover, the nature of the resulting Lev-ZnPc connection does not modify the photodynamic reaction of the hybrid material, which explains its photosensitizing activity. In addition, the obtained material combines the features of both the photosensitizer and the nanomaterial intended for hyperthermia (see magnetization study).",
