            "text": "The International Consensus Report on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma defines asthma as \u201ca chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells play a role, including mast cells and eosinophils. In susceptible individuals this inflammation causes symptoms which are usually associated with widespread, but variable, airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment, and causes an associated increase in airway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli.\u201d The interaction of these features determines the clinical manifestations and severity of the disease and the response to treatment [3]. How these features relate to each other, how they are best measured, and how they contribute to clinical manifestations of the disease remains unclear. Age of disease onset also complicates understanding, although there are many shared features in the diagnosis of asthma in children and in adults, there are also important differences. The differential diagnosis, the natural history of wheezing illnesses, and the ability to perform certain investigations are all influenced by age [4].",

Worldwide, deaths from asthma have reached more than 180,000 annually. Overall, asthma affects 5\u201310% of the population in many developed countries. One study found that the annual estimated incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma ranged from 0.6\u201329.5 per 1000 persons. Risk factors for incident asthma among children include male gender, atopic sensitization, parental history of asthma, early-life stressors and infections, obesity, and exposure to indoor allergens, tobacco smoke, and outdoor pollutants.

Although the costs of asthma care vary by country, it is estimated that worldwide the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from asthma is about 15 million per year. Worldwide asthma accounts for around 1% of all DALYs lost, which reflects the high prevalence and severity of asthma. The number of asthma-caused lost DALYs is similar to that for diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, and schizophrenia. Costs are related to other factors, including asthma control, demographics, medical history, and doses of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) prescribed [6]. Improving asthma control is associated with decreased cost.",

It estimated the resulting net benefit associated with compliance to be \u00a32250 per patient, with a reduction in expected annual treatment costs of approximately \u00a375 per patient per year. Based on an asthma point prevalence of 5.8%, the findings suggest that there are almost 1.8 million asthmatics in the United Kingdom who are noncompliant. If interventions were available to change the behavior of all partially compliant medicine users to raise the percentage to 80% or more, the report estimated that over \u00a3130 million in treatment cost savings could be realized in the United Kingdom alone.

Similarly, a study of 176 families showed a very high concordance of asthma, hayfever, and eczema in parents and children [40]. Twin studies have been useful in identifying a significant concordance of asthma that is higher in monozygotic twins (identical genotype) versus dizygotic twins (on average sharing half of their genes). In the largest study to date, using 11,688 Danish twin pairs, it was suggested that 73% of susceptibility to asthma was genetic, with a substantial environmental component [41]. More recent studies suggest hereditability estimates of 35\u201395% for asthma [42].",

Multiple environmental factors are important in asthma development, including tobacco smoke exposure, respiratory viral infections, antibiotic use, diet, and allergen exposure. Gender and ethnic background also make a significant contribution. This complex mode of inheritance combined with the heterogeneity in the presentation of the disease has made gene discovery a challenge. Early studies investigated inheritance through families containing multiple affected children, using linkage analyses and candidate gene approaches based on biology or location in the genome. However, the reproducibility of these findings was disappointing primarily because of inadequate power, subject heterogeneity (different phenotype definition), population stratification, and multiple testing without correction.",

Although these early studies were performed in different parts of the world and had statistical variations, their results were similar. Age at disease onset was found to be a key differentiating factor; early-onset disease was associated with more atopic and allergic conditions, whereas later-onset disease was associated with eosinophilic inflammation and obesity.

Airway responsiveness is usually measured as the provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 by linear interpolation of the log dose\u2013response curve (PC20). In the general population, the distribution of airway hyper-responsiveness follows a continuous unimodal log-normal distribution, with asthma sufferers representing the hyper-responsive part of the distribution curve.

In the same study, a post hoc multilocus analysis discovered that a combination of rs1154400 with ADRB2 Arg16Gly, Gly27Glu, and the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS1) SNP rs2230739 gave a 70% predictive value for lack of response to therapy [93], implying that pharmacogenetic regulation of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor\u2013agonist therapy may depend on several loci acting together via gene\u2013gene interactions. In confirmation, 4/5 SNPs tested in GSNOR were associated with asthma patient responses to salbutamol in 168 Puerto Rican asthma patients [94]. These SNPs were also associated with asthma susceptibility, and the key risk haplotype was associated with increased transcriptional activity based on promoter-reporter studies [94]. GSNOR is an alcohol dehydrogenase that breaks down GSNO, an endogenous bronchodilator [95]. In addition, GSNO regulates nitrosylation of proteins, leading to alterations in function, including G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which phosphorylates and desensitizes the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor [96].",

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) and dihydroxy leukotriene (LTB4) contribute to the inflammatory process in asthma and are synthesized from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (Figure 28.7\n). Cysteinyl leukotrienes have been implicated in bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, vascular permeability, inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine production. Arachidonic acid is converted to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene A4 (LTA4) by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO/ALOX5) and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP/ALOX5AP), which acts as an adaptor protein for this reaction. LTA4 is then converted to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H) or, alternatively, is conjugated with reduced glutathione to form LTC4 via the actions of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase (LTC4S). LTC4 is next transported to the extracellular space via the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) (Figure 28.7). Leukotriene modifiers include LTSIs, which act by targeting 5-LO (e.g., zileuton), resulting in a decrease in all leukotriene biosynthesis (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTB4) or LTRAs, which act by specifically blocking cysteinyl leukotrienes from binding to their primary receptor, CYSLTR1, which is found on many cell types including inflammatory cells and airway smooth-muscle cells, (e.g., montelukast and zafirlukast).",

The lack of association for the rs892690, and rs2029253 SNPs in the montelukast study may be due to the reduced power of this study compared to the zileuton study.

Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 is thought to be the main receptor mediating cysteinyl leukotriene receptor smooth-muscle contraction and inflammatory cell cytokine production in asthma. Again, genetic variation in the target receptor for these compounds may influence how effective they are in carriers of these alleles by regulating receptor function/expression. The cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 gene, CYSLTR1, is intronless and found on chromosome Xq13-21; it generates a 337 amino acid G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).",

This activates the T-lymphocytes to produce cytokines that regulate immunoglobulin E (IgE) production by the B-lymphocytes. Bound IgE activates mast cells in the airways. Activated mast cells initially release a number of factors, including IL4, leukotrienes, and histamine, that cause airway hyper-responsiveness and result in an early response to allergen stimulus via bronchoconstriction. The concurrent release of cytokines and chemokines from the mast cell recruits eosinophils, basophils, and T-lymphocytes to the airway. These cells, in association with T cell-activated neutrophils and with antigen stimulated macrophages, release chemokines and leukotrienes over an extended period of time, resulting in a late response to allergen stimulus via bronchoconstriction.
