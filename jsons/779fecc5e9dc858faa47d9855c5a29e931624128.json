            "text": "In this paper, we develop a framework to classify the Global supply chain risk management problems and present an approach for the solution of these problems. The risk management problems need to be handled at three levels strategic, operational and tactical. In addition, risk within the supply chain might manifest itself in the form of deviations, disruptions and disasters. To handle unforeseen events in the supply chain there are two obvious approaches: (1) to design chains with built in risk-tolerance and (2) to contain the damage once the undesirable event has occurred. Both of these approaches require a clear understanding of undesirable events that may take place in the supply chain and also the associated consequences and impacts from these events. We focus our efforts on mapping out the propagation of events in the supply chain due to supplier non-performance, and employ our insight to develop a mathematical programming based model for strategic level deviation and disruption management. The first model, a simple integer quadratic optimization model, adapted from the Markowitz model, determines optimal partner selection with the objective of minimizing both the operational cost and the variability of total operational cost. This model offers a possible approach to robust supply chain design.",

            "text": "Supply chain networks are global in nature, comprising of complex interactions and flows of goods, information and funds between companies and facilities geographically distributed across countries and continents. Such chains are currently in operation in a variety of industries such as consumer electronics, automotive, pharmaceutical, aerospace, etc. Despite their complexity, most manufacturing supply chains are structurally similar. The member companies in a typical manufacturing supply chain network include the suppliers and their suppliers, assembly plants, distributors, retailers, inbound and outbound logistics providers and financing institutions. Many factors impact efficient trade in global supply chain networks: inventory visibility, late shipments, transaction costs, import and export laws compliance, customs delays, quality control problems, logistics and transport breakdowns and duplications are just a few. As China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe continue to grow as important economic powerhouses -with other countries becoming key second level suppliers, the cross border issues tend to dominate the supply chain management. Regulatory and compliance complexity as well as infrastructure challenges in those markets create critical supply chain and trade issues (e.g. Anti-terrorism, secure supply chain initiatives, trade facilitation etc). In fact under the intense competitive scenario prevalent today, competition is no longer between companies but between global supply chain networks with similar product offerings, serving the same global customer. The location of the supply chain constituents and the ecosystem in those countries determine the competitiveness of the supply chain. The less studied subject in the supply chain risk field is the Government risk. The antidumping duties, voluntary export restrictions are the means by which Governments would like to protect themselves against the WTO mandates and also the multilateral free trade agreements.",

Significant efforts are expended to expedite orders, to check order status at frequent intervals, to deploy inventory \"justin-case\" and to add safety margins to lead times. These are some of the creative ways employed to counter the occurrence of unforeseen events. These time and material inventories along with limited communications among supply chain partners hide the problems until they lead to serious consequences. Whilst risk has always been present in the process of reconciling supply with demand, there are a number of factors, which have emerged in the last decade or so, which might be considered to have increased the level of risk. These include -a focus on efficiency rather than effectiveness; the globalization of supply chains; focused factories and centralized distribution; the trend towards outsourcing; reduction of the supplier base; volatility of demand; lack of visibility and control procedures. As a result, it has become extremely important for channel masters to employ risk management tools in the management of their supply chains.",

Supply chain risks comprise risks due to variations in information, material and product flows, which originate at the original supplier and lead to the delivery of the final product to the end user. Thus supply chain risks refer to the possibility and effect of a mismatch between supply and demand. Furthermore, risk consequences can also be associated with specific supply chain outcomes like supply chain costs or quality. Within this context, we can identify the following basic constructs of supply chain risk management:",

Hence, supply chains are subjected to internal risks resulting from the interaction between firms within the supply chain and to external risks that are felt by all supply chain networks in the industry, and within the same environment. Consequentially supply chain risks can arise at four levels: organizational, network level, industry level and environmental level, as elaborated in Sect. 2.1. An excellent discussion on this topic may be found in Miller (1992) .",

Furthermore, each of these end states may result in different levels of supply shortfalls and financial cost. Hence, given the probability of each end state and the supply shortfall or financial cost for each end state, we can calculate the expected shortfall or financial risk for the non-performance of a given supplier.

This distinction between the influence of the causal events also results in certain modeling differences between the deviation management models and the disruption management models. In a deviation management model the risk-parameter to be minimized (typically a performance metric such as cost, time or demand) will invariably be modeled as a continuous variable, possibly defined by its mean and average. On the other hand, in a disruption management model the linkage impacting the supply chain network will typically be model as discrete 0 or 1 model representing the existence or absence of the linkage.

The probabilities of supplier disruption for all the suppliers (individually and in various combination) were considered as given. The relation cost was taken as $5,000 and the quantity required by the manufacturer was 520 units. The location, capacities and risks faced for each of the suppliers is listed below in Table 4 . As may be seen from Table 5 , the third supplier is a non-reliable supplier based in Malaysia and the fourth a reliable supplier in Singapore, both of whom are susceptible to the risk resulting from closure of US ports. The fifth supplier is assumed to be a local supplier and is exposed to relatively insignificant risks as compared to the other four overseas-based suppliers. Based on the above characteristics of the various suppliers, the probabilities for various disruption scenarios were calculated in Table 5 . Due to the lack of real-world data, our calculations are based on simulated data. However, it should be possible to perform the same analysis with detailed practical data such a country risk index and supplier rating data. The model was solved with the above data. The optimal selection of suppliers included Suppliers 4 and 5, with an objective value of 10,017. It might be noticed that these two suppliers are the most reliable suppliers.",

In the examples, we focus on the design of robust inbound supply chains, at the strategic level, that are resilient to deviations and disruptions that may occur at the supplier end. Our analysis is based on the identification of unforeseen events that may occur at the supplier end propagate down the supply chain leading to cost variability and supply shortfalls. Robustness is build into our supply chain design by selecting a portfolio of suppliers that minimize the variability of supply chain performance in terms of cost and output. This analysis can be extended to include other exceptions such as import and export compliance. Finally we may mention that our approach of mapping of exceptions and consequences using fault trees and event trees can form the foundation for building decision support systems for exception management in global supply chain networks. 12 Suppliers 2 and 5 disrupted 0.0008",
