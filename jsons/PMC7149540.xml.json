            "text": "\nThe Coronaviridae are a family of enveloped viruses with a single positive-strand RNA genome, and belong to the order Nidovirales. This order was first introduced by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV; Pringle, 1996) in 1996, and comprises the families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae. The designation is derived from the Latin term nidus and reflects the large nested arrangements of subgenomic (sg) messenger RNA (mRNA) (Cavanagh, 1997). The morphological and molecular structures of nidoviruses differ widely, and so the viruses were assigned to the families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Roniviridae and Mesoniviridae, according to their ultrastructural and genomic characteristics (de Groot et al., 2012a, Lauber et al., 2012, Nga et al., 2011, Zirkel et al., 2013). Nidovirales have a unique set of genetic markers: a putative multinuclear zinc-binding domain (ZBD) and a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). The classification of Nidovirales, including the type species, is summarized in Table 20.1\n.",

            "text": "The first step of the infection cycle is attachment of a virion to its cognate cellular receptor. This step is mediated by the S glycoprotein. The conformation of the S glycoprotein changes upon binding, thereby promoting fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane (Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002, Belouzard et al., 2012). Some coronaviruses require cleavage of the\nS glycoprotein for optimal fusion; however, noncleavage does not prevent fusion (Cavanagh, 2005). After fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane, the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm. Virus replication takes place entirely within the cytoplasm of the infected cell. The first step involves attachment of the genomic RNA to ribosomes to facilitate synthesis of viral RdRp, which is encoded by ORF 1b. Structural proteins are produced from sg mRNAs. The viral replicase is encoded by two large ORFs, which overlap at the end of ORF 1a and the beginning of ORF 1b. A conserved \u201cslippery\u201d sequence comprising seven nucleotides is located upstream of a pseudoknot structure at the end of ORF 1a. This specific structure facilitates a ribosomal frame shift, resulting in the translation of two long polyproteins named pp1a and pp1ab. These large nonstructural proteins have never been observed in infected cells (de Groot et al., 2012a). Co- and post-translational processing by viral proteinases generates a range of mature nonstructural proteins, including the replicative proteins. These enzymes and proteins are conserved within coronaviruses and are typical features of nidoviruses. The replicase complex produces complementary copies of the genome. The resulting negative-stranded RNA intermediates serve as template for the generation of positive-stranded viral RNA (genome replication) and for the synthesis of a 3\u02b9 co-terminal nested set of sg mRNAs (transcription) (Sawicki, 2009). The latter are polyadenylated at the 3\u02b9 terminus. With the exception of toroviruses, each sg mRNA carries a short 5\u02b9 leader sequence, which is identical to the 5\u02b9 end of the viral genome. In coronaviruses and bafiniviruses, transcription of genome templates is regulated by a short AU-rich sequence (transcription regulating sequence; TRS); however, in toroviruses, the process is regulated by putative terminator/promoter elements (TPs). The TRS and TPs are not equivalent in terms of function (de Groot et al., 2012a). Coronaviruses and bafiniviruses generate mRNA via discontinuous synthesis, whereas toroviruses employ a mixed transcription procedure (Cavanagh, 2005, de Groot et al., 2012a, de Groot et al., 2012b).",

Envelope formation and recruitment of the M homomultimers is promoted by the integral membrane protein E (Ruch and Machamer, 2012, Ye and Hogue, 2007). The viral RNA combines with the N protein to form the RNP; meanwhile, the M and E proteins distort the membrane to form a sphere around the nucleocapsid. The M proteins then recruit the viral core and spike proteins. The newly formed virions bud into the lumen of the ERGIC. Virus containing Golgi vesicles move to the plasma membrane, where virions exit the cell via exocytosis (Siu et al., 2008, Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994).",

Two of the seals died without showing any clinical signs; however, the third exhibited marked leukocytosis, dehydration, hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. Pathological sections from all three seals revealed extensive focal bronchoalveolar hemorrhage and edema, with severe diffuse pulmonary congestion. Moderate-to-severe lymphoid depletion was detected in the spleen and in visceral and peripheral lymphnodes. Coronavirus-specific antigens were detected in the intestinal mucosa. Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against TGEV, FIPV and canine coronavirus (CCoV) (all alphacoronaviruses) yielded positive results, whereas immunofluorescence staining for bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (a betacoronavirus) was negative. Cross-reactivity among coronaviruses is limited to closely related species (de Groot et al., 2012b). Based on antigenic cross-reactivity, the coronavirus infecting the harbor seals most probably belonged to the genus Alphacoronavirus. However, because none of the ICTV demarcation criteria were met, the pathogen was not assigned to the genus.",

A captive-born beluga whale died from acute liver failure after suffering a short generalized pulmonary disease. Histological examination confirmed acute hepatic necrosis. Electron microscopic examination of liver tissue revealed a great number of round viral particles in the cytoplasm of hepatic cells. The estimated particle size (60\u201380 nm in diameter, with a core of 45\u201350 nm) differed markedly from that of known coronaviruses. Attempts to isolate the pathogen in noncongeneric cell lines failed, indicating that the virus had a specific host tropism. The viral genome was approximately 31.7 kb in size and encoded nonstructural (replicase; ORF 1a and 1b) and structural (S (ORF 2), E (ORF 3), M (ORF 4) and N (ORF 11)) proteins, which were flanked by UTRs. In addition, eight putative ORFs were localized between the genes coding the M and N proteins. The deduced amino acid sequences showed no similarity to proteins from known coronaviruses. Nevertheless, characteristic molecular features were identified: that is, transmembrane domains (ORFs 5 and 9), putative secretion signal sequences (ORFs 7 and 8) and a uridine kinase motif (ORF 10). Phylogenetic analyses of the structural and replicase proteins revealed that the virus was most closely related to avian coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus and turkey coronavirus. Although the homology of the conserved replicase domain (<67%) was markedly lower than the species demarcation threshold (90%), BWCoV SW1 was characterized as a species belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus (de Groot et al., 2012b). Woo et al. (2014) suggested that BWCoV SW1, along with bottlenose dolphin coronaviruses, be listed as a distinct species, Cetacean coronavirus, within the genus Gammacoronavirus.",

            "text": "A marine surveillance study conducted in the Ocean Park in Hong Kong between 2008 and 2010 identified a coronavirus in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Woo et al., 2014). The coronavirus genome was detected in fecal samples from three apparently healthy animals. In contrast to the isolate from beluga whale, which caused liver damage, the BdCoV did not induce any clinical signs/symptoms, indicating an asymptomatic or mild infection. The viral genome was detected during the infectious stage, whereas N-specific antibodies were detected in serum samples at 4\u20138 weeks postinfection. The nearly identical viral genomes isolated from the three bottlenose dolphins belonged to the genus Gammacoronavirus. Attempts to replicate the viruses in several nonhost-specific cell lines were unsuccessful and information about the ultrastructure of the pathogen is lacking. Therefore, the evidence for BdCoV is based on characterization of the viral genome. Genetic analyses suggested that BdCoV was closely related to BWCoV SW1. Both viruses possess a genome of approximately 31.7 kb and both genomes show similar organization. The N protein and conserved domains within replicase polyprotein pp1ab of BdCoV and BWCoV SW1 show 99.6\u201399.3% homology; however, they are less homologous with avian coronaviruses (35.4\u201374.9%). The major difference between the two viruses was detected in the spike protein. Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise amino acid alignments indicated that BWCoV and BdCoV clustered separately within the genus Gammacoronavirus. This finding is consistent with the close genetic relationship between the respective hosts, both of whom belong to the order Cetacea. Therefore, Woo et al. (2014) proposed a new viral species: Cetacean coronavirus.",

            "text": "White bream virus (WBV) is the type species of the genus Bafinivirus within the subfamily Torovirinae. The name bafinivirus was coined because the virus shows bacilliform morphology (ba-) and is a fish (fi-) nidovirus (ni-). The pathogen was isolated from a healthy white bream (B. bjoerkna L.) caught in the Federal State of Saxonia-Anhalt in Germany during a program designed to monitor pathogens in wild freshwater fish (Granzow et al., 2001). The virus replicates at 20\u201326\u00b0C in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC; CCLV Rie 173), Blue gill fry (BF-2; CCLV Rie 290), fathead minnow (FHM; CCLV Rie 057) and carp pituitary (CaPi; CCLV Rie 112) cells and induces cytopathic effects. The pathogen is sensitive to chloroform. Viral particles exhibit ultrastructural features similar to those described for Roniviridae [eg, gill-associated virus (GAV-AUS) and yellow head virus (YHV)] isolated from prawns (Chantanachookin et al., 1993, Spann et al., 1997). The mature enveloped virions measure 170\u2013200 nm in length and 75\u201388 nm in diameter and are surrounded by fuzzy spikes approximately 20\u201325 nm long. The rigid rod-shaped nucleocapsid measures 120\u2013150 \u00d7 19\u201322 nm and the buoyant density of the virus in sucrose is 1.17\u20131.19 g/cm3. The viral genome is 26.6 kb in length and encodes five ORFs, representing the large replicase gene and the structural proteins S, M and N. The virus does not encode a hemagglutinin esterase protein or a homolog of the coronavirus E protein. WBV exhibits molecular features typical of nidoviruses, including a polycistronic genome, the production of sg RNAs during transcription, RFS to express the replicase core domains at the translational level, and post-translational proteolytic processing of viral proteins (Schuetze et al., 2006). Comparative sequence analyses showed that WBV is more closely related to toroviruses than to the other members of the order Nidovirales. Although WBV is related to toroviruses, it is different in several important aspects. First, WBV does not encode the structural gene HE. Second, all WBV sg RNAs possess a 5\u02b9 leader sequence, whereas three out of the four equine torovirus (strain Berne) sg RNAs lack a 5\u02b9 leader. Third, Bafinivirus does not encode cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which is conserved in bovine and equine toroviruses. Fourth, the nonstructural gene products and the structural proteins M, N and S of WBV and torovirus are poorly conserved (Schuetze et al., 2006). Finally, cyprinids are the natural hosts of WBV, whereas mammals are the natural hosts of toroviruses.",

Some fish suffer hemorrhage on the gills and skin, or ulceration of the skin. Cross-reactivity between anti-WBV antibodies and viral isolates from goldfish, tench and grass carp confirms a relationship between these pathogens. Other WBV-like pathogens were isolated from tench and carp after clinical events and fatalities in Germany in 2007 (Fichtner et al., 2009). Infection of specific pathogen-free carp, goldfish and crucian carp (Carassius carassius) with a WBV-like pathogen isolated from a dead carp caused nonspecific clinical signs such as exhaustion, reduced food intake, increased mucus production, pseudofeces and petechiae. No mortalities were recorded (Fichtner et al., 2009). Thus coronaviruses appear to be prevalent in cyprinids.

            "text": "Fathead Minnow Virus (FHMNV) was first isolated from moribund fathead minnows (P. promelas) on a baitfish farm in central Arkansas in 1997 (Iwanowicz and Goodwin, 2002). Affected fish exhibited hemorrhage of the skin and eyes, as well as hepatic, splenic and renal lesions. The virus replicates in EPC, FHM and RTG (rainbow trout gonad) cells between 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. A unique feature of this pathogen is the production of syncytia in both tissues and cell culture. The bacilliform particles measure 130\u2013185\u00d731\u201347 nm. The complete genome sequence suggests that the virus belongs to the genus Torovirus (Batts et al., 2012). The viral ssRNA is approximately 27 kb in length and displays the same genome organization as WBV, with molecular features typical of a nidovirus genome. Comparison of FHMNV helicase (pp1ab domain), S, M, N and ORF 1ab gene products with those of WBV reveals differing levels of homology, ranging from 15% (S protein) to 70% (helicase). The FHMNV pp1ab sequence is 11% homologous with that of equine arteritis virus, whereas the FHMNV helicase is 35% homologous with that of Equine torovirus (EToV). Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved helicase domain revealed that, although FHMNV is a distinct virus, it is the closest relative of WBV identified to date (Batts et al., 2012).",
