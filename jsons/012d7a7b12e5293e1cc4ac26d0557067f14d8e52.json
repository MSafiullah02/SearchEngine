Mutation of 34 PRRT2, a regulator of neurotransmitter release, at glycine-305 was previously linked to 35 paroxysmal neurological disorders in humans. Here, we show that glycine-305 and the 36 homologous site in IFITM3, glycine-95, drive protein oligomerization from within a GxxxG 37 motif. Mutation of glycine-95 in IFITM3 disrupted its oligomerization and reduced its antiviral 38 activity against Influenza A and HIV-1. The oligomerization-defective variant was used to reveal 39 that IFITM3 promotes membrane rigidity in a glycine-95-dependent manner. Furthermore, a 40 compound which counteracts virus inhibition by IFITM3, amphotericin B, prevented the 41 IFITM3-mediated rigidification of membranes. Overall, these data suggest that IFITM3 42 oligomers inhibit virus-cell fusion by promoting membrane rigidity. 43 44 Introduction 45 46",

Cytokines including interferons signal the presence of 48 invading viruses and induce an \"antiviral state\" via the expression of hundreds of antiviral genes 49 [1, 2]. This arsenal of antiviral proteins converges on many steps of the virus life cycle in order 50 to collectively inhibit infection of cells and prevent virus spread. In addition, certain \"front-line\" 51 antiviral proteins impose a constant barrier to infection because they are expressed constitutively 52 and are further upregulated by interferons. The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) 53 proteins are the earliest acting restriction factors known, inhibiting the entry of diverse viruses 54 into cells by restricting fusion pore formation during virus-cell membrane fusion [3-6]. Among 55 the growing list of viruses shown to be inhibited by IFITM proteins in cell culture and in vivo are 56 orthomyxoviruses, flaviviruses, filoviruses, alphaviruses, and coronaviruses [3].

We constructed IFITM3 fused with 192 yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or mCherry to create FRET pairs and to perform FLIM. The 193 measurement of fluorescence lifetimes allows for measurements that are independent of 194 fluorophore expression level or diffusion rate [62]. In this framework, excitation of YFP (donor) 195 results in energy transfer to mCherry (acceptor) when a molecular interaction brings the pair into 196 close proximity. Co-transfection of mCherry and IFITM3-YFP served to establish background 197 FRET values. By comparison, WT IFITM3-YFP and WT IFITM3-mCherry co-transfection 198 resulted in high levels of detectable FRET (Figure 3A and 3B). However, introduction of the 199 G95L mutation significantly reduced FRET, suggesting that glycine-95 is important for 200 oligomerization. FRET was also measured for heterologous pairs (combining WT IFITM3-YFP 201 and G95L-mCherry, and vice versa) and the results were indicative of an intermediate degree of 202 oligomerization (Figure 3B). To complement our FRET analysis, we also analyzed fluorescence 203 lifetimes of the donor (YFP). Co-transfection of WT IFITM3-YFP and WT IFITM3-mCherry 204 resulted in significant decreases in YFP lifetimes, consistent with IFITM3 oligomerization 205",

Supplemental Figure 3: Antiviral activity of differentially-tagged IFITM3 and effect of 624 glycine-91 on IFITM3 oligomerization. 625 (A) HEK293T were transiently transfected with 1.5 micrograms of empty pQCXIP, FLAG-, 626 YFP-, or mCherry-tagged IFITM3 (either WT or G95L) and, 48 hours later, challenged with 627 IAV PR8 strain at a MOI of 0.1. Cells were fixed, stained with an anti-nucleoprotein antibody, 628 and assessed by flow cytometry at 18 hours post-infection. Results represent the mean of three 629 independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard error. (B) HEK293T were transiently co-630 transfected with IFITM3-YFP and mCherry or IFITM3-YFP and IFITM3-mCherry. Constructs 631 encoded WT IFITM3 or IFITM3 G95L. Whole-cell YFP lifetimes were measured on a minimum 632 of 50 cells per condition and the results of three independent experiments were pooled. Dots 633 correspond to individual cells. Empty red circles are used to depict mCherry, filled red circles are 634",
