The case numbers up to April 5 can be found in the supplemental data (Appendix A). As at the point of writing this brief, the dataset contains 39 time-series data points. For forecasting purposes, earlier days with zero incidences of COVID-19 were filtered for building the forecast models. This is presented in tabular form in Table 1 -2 and visual form in Fig. 1 while the number of new cases per day is shown in Fig. 2 . Seven successive daily forecasts by the ensemble, starting from March 29, 2020, to April 5, 2020, are presented in Table 3 . The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation behavior of the dataset of Fig. 3 aids in developing ARIMA modeling insights.

            "text": "In this paper, we present the application of ensemble forecasting models in a data constrained environment. The objective is to establish the lower and upper bounds on the possible number of COVID-19 cases per day using a framework that automatically streams web data in real-time from reliable sources. This data is used for retraining and adapting the parameters of an ensemble of three models which in turn updates its forecast prediction for the following day. Each of the three models provides an estimated lower bound and upper bound for the number of cases. The Ensemble forecast is achieved by taking the minimum of the lower bounds and the maximum of the upper bounds. Due to limited sources of data (the only available information is a single variable, \"number of COVID-19 cases per day\"), it makes it difficult to implement specialized, advanced, and more generalizable methods that often require a variety of features and bigger datasets. It is also important to highlight that there are only a few samples (22) represents the series of differences, are the coefficients, the and are the lagged predictors for the model [2] . The ARIMA model is a generalization of many sub-models and characterized by three parameters: order of autoregressive observations , degree of differencing , and number of moving average terms . The foundations of ARIMA lie on the fact that nonstationary time-series can be made stationary by through differencing. The verification of stationarity can be achieved using autocorrelation plots and unit root tests such as the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test [3] . For this model, we are interested in non-seasonal phenomena. Using brute search and inspection of the autocorrelation function ACF and partial autocorrelation function PACF plots (Figure 3) , an ARIMA (2,1,0) model was chosen.",

Figure 5 presents the comparison of COVID 19 cases in South Africa (SA) with Nigeria (NG). The figure shows that the number of confirmed cases of the infection in SA in geometrically higher than NG. This observation could be explained from two perspectives: (i) SA either has much more people infected with COVID-19 than NG; (ii) or there is wider coverage in the number of people test per day among the population. The latter reason may probably be stronger than the former as there is corroboratory evidence for the later. As of the 20th March 2020, SA had conducted 6,438 tests [10] while Nigeria only performed 69 tests [11] .",

We find evidence that this strategy is effective in the containment of the infection in SA. SA declared a National lockdown on the 26th of March, 2020 [12] to tame the spread of infection. As shown in Figure 5 , there was a kink in the progression of confirmed cases on March 27, 2020. The steepness of the curve was relatively flattened and steady for a few days thereafter. The steep upward trend of the infections was stemmed the same day the national lockdown policy was announced. The fact that those that have been infected before the lockdown will be presenting themselves for tests and treatment could have accounted for a slight rise in cases within 2 weeks of lockdown. The full compliance with the policy and number of new cases in post-2-weeks lockdown policy are scenarios that would guide further actions in SA.",
