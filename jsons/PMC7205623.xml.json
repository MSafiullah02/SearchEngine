            "text": "Every infectious disease outbreak exhibits certain patterns and such patterns needed to be identified based on transmission dynamics of such outbreaks. Intervening measures to eradicate such infectious diseases rely on the methods used to evaluate the outbreak when it occurs. Any outbreak in a country or province usually occurs at different levels of magnitude with respect to time i.e. seasonal changes, adaptation of virus over time. Usually patterns exhibited in such scenarios are non-linear in nature and this motivates us to design the system that can capture such non-linear dynamic changes. With the help of these non-linear systems, we can describe the transmission of such infectious diseases. In [1]\n[2] a transmission model for malaria and in [3] a mathematical model for analysing dynamics of tuberculosis has been developed to study the transmission using mathematical models. In [4] a laplacian based decomposition is used to solve the non-linear parameters in a Pine Witt disease. A modified SIRS model in [5] successfully helped to control the syncytial virus in infants. Similarly mathematical models presented in [6], [7] helped clinicians to better understand the characteristics of human liver and transmission of dengue outbreak.",

In this model, an extra weight is applied to the person who never infected the current disease nor vaccinated.

In the world of smart devices, data is being generated in the unprecedented way than ever before and promoted the role of machine learning in healthcare [16]. The world today is more connected than ever before this helped to share the real time infectious data between the countries. The distinctive feature of artificial intelligence is its flexibility, domain adaptation and economical to integrate with existing systems. Over the last few weeks, many researchers came up with several mathematical models to predict the transmission of novel corona virus [17]\n[18]. The major drawbacks of the existing models are linear, non-temporal and several assumptions while modelling the network. First of all, the covid-19 is a time series data set and it is highly recommended to use the sequential networks to extract the patterns from it. Second of all, the data we are dealing with is dynamic in nature so by using statistical and epidemiological models, results are often vague [19]\n[20]. In [21], [22], [23], [24] researchers used deep learning based LSTM networks to forecast COVID-19 infections. The LSTM models used in the above networks could not able to represent the spatio-temporal components simultaneously. In this paper we addressed the above problem by modifying the internal connections. In our modified LSTM cells, We have established the alternative connections between the input and output cells. This type of connections not only helps the networks to preserve spatio-temporal components, but also to transfer the historical information to the next units.",

After selecting the key parameters of the network, several experiments was conducted to find the optimal model that can predict future infections with minimum error. Previous studies on COVID-19 predictions, did not considered the recovery rate while developing the model. In this research, we considered the recovery rate as one of the features while building our model. From the design point of view, when a crisis occurs, algorithms tend to assign high probability and completely neglects the previous information which leads to biased predictions.

A trend in TS can be observed when a certain pattern repeats on regular intervals of time due to external factors like lockdown of country, mandatory social distancing, quarantines etc. In many real-world scenarios, either of trend or seasonality are absent.

Gates in LSTM helps in processing the information with the help of activation function (sigmoid) and output is in between 0 or 1. Reason behind using sigmoid activation function is because, we need to pass only positive values to the next gates for getting a clear output.
