Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosite occupancy by different glycoforms exhibited remarkable heterogeneity in human cell-expressed protein subunits, including up to 157 N-glycans, mainly of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.",

            "text": "low-frequency glycosylation may occur, because our integrated methods, including glycopeptide enrichment and deglycosylation, failed to improve the spectra. Apart from the canonical N-glycosylation sequons, three non-canonical motifs of N-glycosites (N164, N334, and N536) involving N-X-C sequons were not glycosylated. Before enrichment, an average of 15 N-glycosites from trypsin-digested peptides and 13 N-glycosites from Glu-C-digested peptides were assigned. In contrast, hydrophilic enrichment resulted in a significant increase of these glycosites to 18 and 16, respectively (Table S1 ). To further assess the necessity for enrichment, we compared the representative spectra of one intact N-glycopeptide (N149) before and after enrichment. Without interference from the non-glycosylated peptides, the intact N-glycopeptide had more fragmented ions assigned to N-glycosites after enrichment ( Fig. S3 ). Complementary digestion with trypsin and Glu-C promoted the confident identification of four N-glycosites (N603, N616, N709 and N717) on two intact N-glycopeptides (Table S1 and Fig. S1C ). The introduction of Glu-C digestion resulted in the production of two short intact N-glycopeptides containing 23 and 36 amino acids, respectively. These peptides are more suitable for achieving better ionization and fragmentation than the long peptide of 48 and 57 amino acids obtained from trypsin digestion (Fig. S4 ). Deglycopeptides are suitable for verifying glycosylation sites (Fig. S5) . Unexpectedly, deglycopeptide peptides led to the loss of a few glycosites, presumably because of peptide loss during deglycosylation procedures. However, almost all glycosites were confidently confirmed using trypsin and Glu-C dual digestion (Table S1 ).",

These sites were preferentially distributed in the S1 subunit of the N-terminus and the S2 subunit of the C-terminus, including two sites in the RBD ( Fig. 2A and 2B ). To visualize the N-glycosylation on the protein structure, all of the experimentally determined N-glycosites were hand-marked on the surface of the trimeric S protein following refinement of the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 S protein Cryo-EM structure (PDB: 6VSB) ( Based on these findings, we further analyzed the conservation of glycosites among 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. After the removal of redundant sequences of the S protein at the amino acid residue level, we refined 145 S protein variants. A very low frequency of alterations in 38 residue sites was found, uniformly spanning the full length of the S protein among all S variants, except for the substitution G614D, which was identified at a relatively high frequency in 47 variants (Table S5) . However, nearly all of the 22 N-glycosylated sequons were conserved in the S protein, except for the loss of the N717 glycosite due to the T719A substitution in only one S variant.",

Four newly arisen N-glycosites (N17, N74, N149, and N657) are located in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S1 subunit away from the RBD. Moreover, four previously confirmed N-glycosites (N29, N73, N109, and N357) in the SARS-CoV S protein were missing in SARS-CoV-2 S, one of which (N357) lies in the RBD (Fig. S6 ). Additionally, two N-glycosites (N1158 and N1173) identified in SARS-CoV-2 S in this study were not detected in SARS-CoV S (N1140 and N1155) in previous studies (5, 21) .

Moreover, more than 80% of glycan compositions are identical at each site among different lengths of insect cell-expressed proteins (Fig. 4D) . Similarly, over 75% of the glycan compositions at each site were found to be shared by human cell-produced products (Fig. 4E ). The N-glycosylation of RBDs was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig.S9) . These results suggest that the N-glycan compositions are conserved among different sizes of RBD proteins.

The development of preventative vaccines and neutralizing antibodies remains a chief goal in the efforts to control viral spread and stockpile candidates for future use. However, this work greatly relies on the understanding of the antigen structure and state of glycosylation for the rational determination of accessible epitopes. The S protein is posited to be the main or even the only antigen on viral surfaces for priming the immune system to produce an effective response (15, 18). Previous studies have revealed the structural information of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found the coverage of N-glycans (4, 10) . In this study, we profiled the site-specific N-glycosylation of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein. All potential N-glycosites on the S protein were identified experimentally. The N-glycan compositions and types on S protein subunits were revealed among different host cells. Our data provide a large-scale N-glycosylation information of the S protein and present a promising prospect for developing a vaccine and therapeutic antibodies.",

In this study, all 22 N-glycosites of the S protein were identified ( Fig. 2A and 2B ). By comparison, the alteration of N-glycosites among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins focused on glycosites in the S1 subunit (Fig. S6 ). The N-glycosites located in the S2 subunit are completely conserved, and seven out of nine sites, along with glycans have been disclosed by previous studies (4, 5) . Moreover, we found that N-glycosites in the S protein were highly preserved among 145 SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants (Table S5) , which is advantageous for circumventing potential viral immune evasion from the vaccines and neutralizing antibodies currently being developed.",

Our findings are in line with those of previous studies, that demonstrated the predominant complex of N-glycans attached to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV proteins (4, 5, 28) . Moreover, two recent preprint studies have revealed that the complex N-glycans dominate the glycosites on human cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein (29, 30) . In contrast, S protein expression in insect cells led to a high ratio of high-mannose N-glycans ( Fig. 3C and 3E ), which has also been found in the insect cell-produced HCoV-NL63 S protein, despite expression in a different insect cell, the Drosophila S2 cell, in the previous study(15).",

These features may provide a promising landscape on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for immune recognition. This potential is bolstered by the findings that the convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients contains antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (7) . A previous study on SARS-CoV has revealed that the oligomannose on the S protein can be recognized by The remarkable heterogeneity of N-glycosylation in the S protein subunit expressed in human cells was revealed in our study (Fig. 3F ). By contrast, the N-glycosylation of the S protein subunit in insect cells showed less heterogeneity and complexity than that of human cell-derived proteins (Fig. 3E) . Moreover, the site-specific glycan occupancy tended to be identical in the same host cell, regardless of protein length ( Fig. 4D and 4E) . These results indicate the N-glycan compositions and types on S protein largely attribute to different host cells with the differential processing pathways of glycosylation. We can expect that the native N-glycosylation profile of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in humans tends to be consistent with that of the recombinant protein expressed in human cells, unless the virus buds off early in the glycosylation processing pathway and produces immature glycans (19, 27, 35) .",

Meanwhile, the subunit vaccines are posited to minimize the potentially undesired immunopotentiation of the full-length S protein, which might induce severe acute injury in the lungs(41). Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 is missing one N-glycosite in RBD compared to SARS-CoV. The remaining two N-glycosites were outside of the motifs essential for direct interaction with the ACE2 receptor(11) (Fig. 2C) . The glycan compositions of RBD are highly identical in the same host cell, regardless of the length of the RBD-containing proteins (Fig. 4B-4E ). These features of the RBD, along with its highly exposed structure, endow more antigens and accessible epitopes for vaccine design and immune recognition. The RBD-containing proteins, especially the insect cell-expressed products, could become promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.

The average occupancies of all glycosites presented as an overwhelming proportion (~75%) of complex N-glycans and a small proportion of hybrid (~13%) or high-mannose (~12%) N-glycans(Fig. 3F). The glycan occupancy on two N-glycosites (N331 and N343) of RBD were identified (Fig. 3E and 3F). The high occupancy of RBD glycosites by various N-glycan compositions implies that N-glycosylation might be associated with the recognition of RBD to ACE2 receptor, since the interaction between RBD and ACE2 mainly depends on polar residue interactions(11). Our results suggest that S proteins expressed in different cells display distinct N-glycosylation patterns. In particular, the glycosylation of the S protein in human cells exhibits remarkable heterogeneity on N-glycosites. However, the N-glycan types on each glycosite is primarily determined by the host cells rather than the location of different glycosites (Fig. 3E-3F, Fig. S8).",

Besides the direct neutralization effect, MBL, as a serum complement protein, can initiate the complement cascade. Complement hyper activation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients has been revealed by a recent preprint study(32). However, it remains unknown whether MBL can bind to oligomannose on SARS-CoV-2 S protein to impact the viral spread or initiate complement activation in patients. Glycans also play crucial and multifaceted roles in B cell and T cell differentiation via cell-surface or secreted proteins, including selectins, galectins, and siglecs, which can further connect SARS-CoV-2 to immune response and immune regulation(27). In particular, the complex N-glycans are ligands for galectins, which are able to engage different glycoproteins to regulate immune cell infiltration and activation upon virus infection(33, 34). These mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread are worth further clarification based on a detailed analysis of clinical characteristics in humoral and cellular immunity.",

In contrast, the vaccine antigens produced from mammalian cells do not always induce a strong humoral immune response in mice, because of the complex-type N-glycans(39). To prime strong humoral immunity upon vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, insect cell-produced antigens with less complex N-glycans could be one of the candidates for the development of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Apart from amino acid epitopes, the glycopeptide can be presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and recognized by a CD4+T-cell population to help B cells produce antibodies against glycans. The glycoconjugate has been used to boost the immune response against infections(23, 24).",
