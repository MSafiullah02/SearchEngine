Assessing the impact of such openings in relation to the risk of a resumption of the spread of the disease is an extremely difficult problem due to the many unknowns concerning the actual number of people infected, the actual reproduction number and infection fatality rate of the disease. In this work, starting from a compartmental model with a social structure, we derive models with multiple feedback controls depending on the social activities that allow to assess the impact of a selective relaxation of the containment measures in the presence of uncertain",

The end of the pandemic will not immediately correspond to the disappearance of SARS-CoV2. This is why an intermediate phase is being carefully considered, with some activities that can be resumed immediately, regulating the reintegration of workers, for example through indicators measuring the impact of work activities on potential infections, increasing prevention measures, or through so-called immunity passports. Several question marks over convalescence times and the real extent of the contagion also raise fears of a second wave. It is essential to build scenarios that will help us understand how the situation might evolve in the future.",

It is therefore of primary importance to analyze the possibility of relaxing the control measures put in place by many countries in order to make them more sustainable on the socio-economic front, keeping the reproductive rate of the epidemic under control and without incurring health risks [23, 16, 19] .",

At this stage the estimation mainly serves to calibrate the model parameters and its variability will then be considered in the intrinsic uncertainty of these values. On the contrary, the control action is estimated in the first lockdown phase using the data available to date. Phase two, therefore, on the modelling front is characterized by a third temporal region following the first lockdown period, in which social characteristics become essential to quantify the impact of possible decisions of the various governments.",

As a function of the penalization introduced on the curve of the infected or recovered we have a better adaptation of the model to the respective curves thus obtaining a range for the reproduction number R 0 . We observed that, in general, fitting the curve of infectious yields a larger estimated reproduction number compared to fitting the curve of recovered. On the other hand, the lack of reliable informations concerning the recovered in early stages of the disease suggests to adapt the model mainly to the curve of infectious and to introduce the uncertainty in the reproductive number using this estimated value as an upper bound of the reproduction number. Due to the heterogeneity of the data between the different countries, in order to have comparable results with reproduction numbers R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 \u2208 (4.5, 9.5) we constrained the value of \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 0.6) and the value of \u03b3 \u2208 (0.04, 0.06).

The trends have been computed using a weighted least square fitting with the model function k(t) = ae bt (1 \u2212 e ct ). For some countries, like France, Spain and Italy after an initial adjustment phase the penalty term converges towards a peak and has just started to decrease. This is consistent with a situation in which data concerning the number of reported infectious needs a certain period of time before being affected by the lockdown policy and can also be considered as an indicator of an unstable situation where reducing control may lead to a potential restart of the infectious curve. The penalty terms for the US and the UK clearly indicates that the pandemic is still in its growing phase and the situation is far from a controlled equilibrium state. The only exception is represented by Germany where the dynamic corresponds to a significative decrease in the penalization term as a result of a timely implementation of social distancing measures.",

According to recent results on the diffusion of COVID-19 in many countries the number of infected, and therefore recovered, is largely underestimated on the official reports, see e.g. [28, 33] . One possible way to understand this is based on a renormalization process of the reported data based on the estimated infection fatality rate (IFR) of Covid-19. Although estimating the true IFR is generally hazardous while an epidemic is underway, some studies have estimated an overall IFR around 1.3% with an age dependent credible interval [41, 39] . In the sequel we consider a range spanning between 0.9% \u2212 2.0%. On the contrary the current fatality rate (CFR) may vary strongly from country to country accordingly to the differences in the number of people tested, demographics, health care system. One way to have in insight in the uncertainty of data is to use the estimated IFR ranges as normalization factors for the current data reported of total cases I tot . This is done computing an estimated number of total confirmed cases as\u00ce tot = 100 \u00d7 D r /IFR, where D r is the total number of confirmed deaths. The results of the variations\u00ce tot /I tot for the various countries are summarized in Figure 2 and are directly proportional to the CFR of the country. We are aware that the estimate obtained is certainly coarse, nevertheless it allows to get an idea of the disagreement between the data observed and expected in the various countries and therefore to be able to define a common scenario between the various countries.",

Work and other activities are equally impacted by the lockdown. In particular, these initial lockdown choices make it possible to have a good correspondence between the infectivity curves expected in the age dependent case and in the homogeneous mixing case. Therefore, these values have been set homogeneously for each country and correspond to the situation in the first lockdown period. We will discuss possible changes to these choices following a relaxation of the lockdown in the different scenarios presented below. We divided the computation time frame into two zones and used different models in each zone, in accordance with the policy adopted by the various countries. The first time interval defines the period without any form of containment, the second the lockdown period. In the first zone we adopted the uncontrolled model with homogeneous mixing for the estimation of epidemiological parameters. Hence, in the second zone we compute the evolution of the feedback controlled age dependent model (11) with matching (on average) interaction and recovery rates (17) and with the estimated control penalization \u03ba(t). The initial values for the age distributions of susceptible have been taken from the specific demographic distribution of each country. More difficult is to get the same informations for the infected, since reported data are rather heterogeneous for the various country and the initial number of individuals is very small (we selected a time frame where the reported number of infectious is larger than 200). Therefore, we tested the available data against a uniform distribution. As there were no particular differences in the results, we decided to adopt a uniform initial distribution of the infected for all countries. In Figure 6 we report the age distribution of infected computed for each country at the end of the lockdown period using an age dependent recovery and a constant recovery. The differences in the resulting age distributions are evident. In subsequent simulations, to avoid an unrealistic peak of infection among young people, we decided to adopt an age-dependent recovery [42] .",

The results of the previous scenarios have shown that it may be possible for some countries, like Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, to relax the lockdown measures albeit with some risk of an increase in the contagion curve. On the contrary, in all scenarios considered, the situation in the UK and the US suggests that any loosening of containment measures should be postponed.

In the second phase only productive activities are restarted and partially home interactions and other activities. In a third phase school activities are also partially reopened (see Table 2 ). on a two-stage opening of the blocking measures with a progressive approach. This possibility is analysed for the four countries where it might be possible to partially reopen production activities without restarting the contagion curve. For each country we have selected a progressive lockdown relaxation focused mainly on the opening of productive activities in the second phase and with a partial reprise of school activities in the third phase. The reduction of the controls are now country specific and the values are reported in Table 2 . In Figure 10 we plot the resulting behavior for the expected number of current infectious. The simulations show that for all these countries, it is possible to relax the containment measures in a progressive way by keeping the infection curve under control. However, timing and intensity of the relaxation choices play a fundamental rule in the process.",

The simulation parameters have been obtained using data coming from several countries with\"comparable situations\" in terms of epidemic progress, such as Italy, France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
