Strain-specific PCR was performed using saved BAL samples as described previously [19]. We performed RT-PCR to detect HCoV RNA in frozen serum samples that were drawn between 23 days before and 23 days after the BAL. When adequate lung tissue was available, curls were cut from fresh frozen tissue or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks for RT-PCR. FFPE samples and frozen samples were extracted using RNAeasy FFPE kit and RNAeasy mini kit, respectively (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All samples underwent fragment size analysis for quality with RT-PCR targeting amplicons from housekeeping genes with sizes ranging from 100 to 600 base pairs (bp).",

HCoV was considered the sole respiratory pathogen if all above-mentioned microbiological test results on BAL specimens were negative. Pulmonary bacterial coinfection was defined as bacterial load of >103 colony-forming units per milliliter of BAL specimen with compatible radiological findings and clinical course. Any virus or fungus detected in BAL samples was considered a respiratory copathogen. Highest steroid doses in the 2 weeks prior to HCoV LRTD and cell counts most immediately prior to HCoV LRTD were recorded. Oxygen-free days and ventilator-free days are defined as days alive and free from oxygen support and mechanical ventilation, respectively [16]. Respiratory death was defined as any death occurring as a consequence of respiratory failure.",

We also excluded 2 HCT recipients with a history of lung transplantation for outcome analyses except for evaluation of risk factors for mortality following HCoV LRTD. Univariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate risk factors for overall mortality by day 90 after the diagnosis of HCoV LRTD. Variables with a P value \u2264.2 in the univariable models were candidates for multivariable models. A multivariable Cox regression model adjusted for respiratory viruses (HCoV, RSV, influenza, and PIV), cell source, neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, monocyte counts, presence of copathogens, steroid dosage, and oxygen use at diagnosis was performed. Patients with any respiratory viral copathogens were excluded for this analysis. The probability of overall mortality in HCT recipients by day 90 following the diagnosis of LRTD was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare mortality curves among subgroups. Two-sided P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.

Two HCT recipients had a history of lung transplantation: 1 underwent lung transplantation for bronchiolitis obliterans related to previous HCT and the other received lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis before HCT. Only 1 pediatric patient (8-year-old male) was identified in this cohort.

All but 1 of the 20 patients with HCoV LRTD >100 days following transplant received either immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy to control their underlying disorders (eg, relapse of hematologic malignancy, graft-vs-host disease) prior to diagnosis of LRTD. Twenty-three recipients were transplanted after 1 May 2006 when respiratory viral PCR panel testing became routine. The median time to HCoV LRTD after HCT in these 23 patients was 340 days (range, 8\u20133618 days), which was similar to that of entire cohort. At the time of BAL, acute respiratory symptoms and new pulmonary infiltrates were present in the majority of episodes (Table 2). Among 23 available frozen BAL samples, 11 (48%) were identified as OC43, 5 (22%) as NL63, 4 (17%) as 229E, and 3 (13%) as HKU1.

Although 4 other strains of HCoV (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are also human pathogens, the clinical impact of HCoV LRTD remains unclear, especially in immunocompromised patients [4, 14, 23]. A previous prospective study with weekly nasal surveillance sampling during the first 100 days after HCT demonstrated prolonged HCoV shedding in the upper respiratory tract (>3 weeks) in half of subjects including asymptomatic patients [8]. In addition, respiratory copathogens were identified in more than half the episodes in this study (57%). Given the prolonged asymptomatic shedding and frequent detection of respiratory copathogens, attributing poor clinical outcomes to HCoV in the lower respiratory tract may be difficult. In the current study, follow-up BAL procedures were not performed to assess prolonged shedding in the lower respiratory tract; however, a prior study that included only 4 patients with cancer demonstrated that only 1 of 10 cases had HCoV detected in follow-up BAL specimens, arguing against asymptomatic prolonged shedding in the lower respiratory tract [14]. More data are needed to define shedding duration in the immunocompromised population. In our study, clinical outcomes including intensity of respiratory support, days alive without hospitalization, and mortality were not significantly different between patients with and without other copathogens, suggesting that HCoV in the lower respiratory tract can contribute to severity of LRTD regardless of copathogens. Lung tissue from 1 patient was positive for HCoV by RT-PCR. This patient subsequently developed prolonged oxygen requirement, which also supports the potential pathogenicity of HCoV.",

Given the common perception of HCoV as a relatively benign pathogen based on limited data [5, 8], our data are somewhat surprising. The adverse impact of oxygen requirement at the time of diagnosis on subsequent clinical outcome has been suggested [16, 24]. Once substantial acute lung injury occurs, clinical outcome can potentially be affected by inflammation rather than virus itself. Therefore, mortality rates by day 90 following LRTD caused by HCoV, RSV, influenza virus, and PIV were also compared according to oxygen requirement at the time of LRTD diagnosis; no statistically significant difference was found. These data combined suggest that HCoV LRTD is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome in this immunocompromised population.",

This is the first study to describe that all 4 HCoV strains can be detected in BAL samples with and without any other respiratory copathogens in a large immunocompromised population.

The median time to HCoV LRTD following HCT was 302 days, which was longer than median days to LRTD caused by RSV (52.5 days), PIV (78 days), and influenza (95 days) [16, 17, 30]. Because this may in part be due to the fact our cohort included some patients who were transplanted prior to the introduction of routine HCoV PCR testing, we separately analyzed patients who underwent transplantation after introduction of a respiratory viral PCR panel in 2006 and determined the median time of diagnosis remained similar (340 days). The majority of patients who developed HCoV LRTD >100 days following transplant had received either chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy as predisposing factors. This does not explain why there is a relatively lower incidence of HCoV LRTD early after transplant. Differences in infection control practices early after transplant and factors that affect progression to LRTD early vs late after transplant may play a role. Further studies are needed to determine why HCoV often causes LRTD late after transplant.",

In addition, RT-PCR was performed on serum specimens, lung biopsy samples, and autopsy samples. The main limitation of this study was the relatively small sample size, which prevented us from detecting small differences and performing multivariable analyses to evaluate risk factors for mortality in patients with HCoV LRTD. Another limitation is the fact that BAL samples were available in only two-thirds of the patients for strain identification, which limited our ability to compare clinical and virological differences among each HCoV strain. Among a total of 9 lung biopsy and autopsy samples, only 1 lung biopsy sample, which was taken on the same day as the BAL, was positive for HCoV by RT-PCR. The lower rate of detection may be due to the fact that the negative samples were obtained from 19 days to 67 days after the diagnosis of LRTD, suggesting that the timing of collecting samples may have been too late to identify HCoV in lung specimens. Furthermore, not all samples were optimally preserved for RT-PCR, and thus the sensitivity for HCoV may have been suboptimal.",

Thus, we conclude that HCoV appears to be a significant respiratory pathogen in the populations studied. This is an important observation because HCoVs are highly prevalent in immunocompromised hosts. The appreciation of HCoV as an important lower respiratory tract pathogen could impact clinical management including risk stratification in future studies and provide a rationale to develop antiviral therapies.
