SARS has dramatically demonstrated the wide-ranging impact on a highly mobile world. In response to the SARS outbreak, delegates of the 56th World Health Assembly, organized by WHO in May 2003, unanimously adopted a resolution authorizing WHO to act on information arising from sources other than official government notifications. In addition, WHO was asked to conduct on-the-spot investigations to ensure that an affected country has sufficient control to prevent international spread.",

SARS-CoV as a novel coronavirus (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Yount et al., 2003) is an infectious respiratory disease. It starts with a fever, chills, headache and body aches, followed by a dry cough within 2\u20137 days. The most distinguishing feature is breathing difficulty. In severe cases, radiography can provide corroborative evidence of SARS by diagnosing pneumonia. The virus has a spherical enveloped virion. The size is between 80 and 160 nm diameters with a single stranded RNA of about 30 kb, which is the largest genome of all single stranded RNA viruses (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2002). In the electron micrograph image, glycoproteins on the virus' surface give the virions a halo or crown-like appearance, and hence the name coronavirus.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses with exceptionally large genome sizes (Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002). The replication and transcription of coronaviruses are encoded by the replicase genes (Thiel et al., 2001a,b). In many studies, 15-mers (P8P7P6P5P4P3P2P1P1\u2032P2\u2032P3\u2032P4\u2032P5\u2032P6\u2032P7\u2032) were used to represent corresponding 3CLpro cleavage sites in the replicase polyproteins (Merrifield, 1965). It was indicated in Hegyi and Ziebuhr (2002) and Pallai et al. (1989) that the conserved prototypic viruses suggest that the order of cleavage events may occur in all coronaviruses. The structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV protease have been analysed using a molecular dynamics simulation technique (Lee et al., 2003), where molecular docking has been carried out in order to search for potential SARS-CoV protease inhibitors. Previously characterized coronaviruses encode two papain-like cysteine proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro), which cleave the N-proximal polyprotein regions at three sites (Bonilla et al., 1997; Gorbalenya et al., 1991; Herold et al., 1998; Thiel et al., 2001b; Ziebuhr et al., 2001). The recent studies show that 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) cleaves the central and C-proximal regions at 11 conserved sites (Hardy et al., 2002; Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002; Tibbles et al., 1999; Ziebuhr et al., 2000).",

Besides, all the SARS-CoV genomes sequenced to date demonstrate surprisingly little variation with mutations at only \u223c30 nucleotides. Based on this, Scientists suggest that the virus entered the human population recently from a single point source through mutation. The study has also shown that the SARS-CoV is similar to a civet CoV. It is then hypothesized that the virus could have jumped the species barrier from civets to humans and the SARS-CoV was mutated from non-human coronavirus (Hu et al., 2003).",

It has been indicated that although vaccines are available for some animal coronaviruses, some of them can promote the disease when vaccinated animals are exposed to the wild-type virus. Moreover, antibody enhancement of disease is a potential risk of SARS vaccines in humans (Holmes, 2003; Lee et al., 2003). This means that it will take many years to develop a good preventive vaccine against SARS-CoV. It was suggested by Lee et al. (2003) to optimize the use of available drugs as inhibitors through studying the enzyme conformation. A recent study used a frequency estimation method to detect the cleavage sites within a specified region based on the knowledge of average length of cleavage products. (Gao et al., 2003). In that study, 12-mers P6P5P4P3P2P1P1\u2032P2\u2032P3\u2032P4\u2032P5\u2032P6\u2032 and 8-mers P4P3P2P1P1\u2032P2\u2032P3\u2032P4\u2032 were used for PLpro and 3CLpro cleavage sites, respectively.",

            "text": "According to our previous experience in analysing protein sequences, the prediction capability of the functional sites (cleavage sites in this study) depends on the inherent patterns in sub-sequences. If the patterns are not complicated (i.e., the sites in the sub-sequences are orthogonal to each other), simple rules can be explored by using inductive programming methods; the prediction of phosphorylation sites in proteins is such a case (Berry et al., 2004). However, most cases are not simple. The success of prediction of the functional sites needs more advanced investigation (Thomson et al., 2003; Yang and Chou, 2004a,b). A novel method is therefore proposed in this study for mining sub-sequence data. Instead of using the sites in k-mers as the inputs to an inductive programming model, it is proposed to transform k-mers to a high-dimensional numerical space through a mapping. An inductive programming method is then used in this high-dimensional space. The transform of k-mers needs a proper function to ensure the biological content in the k-mers can be maintained for data mining. In this study, the bio-basis function proposed in Thomson et al. (2003) is used for this mapping, referred to as a bio-mapping. With the bio-mapping, each k-mer is represented using a vector denoting its position in this high-dimensional space. After the mapping, an inductive programming is employed regarding the mapping vectors as the inputs. The modelling process itself will select the most informative and decisive k-mers to construct a non-orthogonal decision tree. These selected k-mers are then regarded as the templates for decision-making. Importantly, these templates are the representatives for the training k-mers, and hence the knowledge hidden in the training k-mers. Instead of resulting in rules like \u2018if P1 = Q, then the k-mer cleaved\u2019, non-orthogonal decision trees will have rules like \u2018if a query k-mer is similar to a cleaved template, then the k-mer is cleaved\u2019.",

            "text": "Decision trees are a kind of inductive programming algorithms (Breiman et al., 1984; Quinlan, 1988). They select a hyper-plane orthogonal to an axis of a variable through maximizing its \u2018purity\u2019. If a hyper-plane can make 100% separation between patterns from two classes with respect to a certain threshold value, its purity is 1. Otherwise, the purity value will be <1. Each hyper-plane divides a given region into two disjoint sub-regions. If each sub-region only comprises one class of patterns, the hyper-plane has a purity value as 1. The process of selecting hyper-planes continues till each resulting sub-region is pure for one class. The node which is pure for one class is referred to as a leaf. In terms of this, each leaf has an associated class label. From this, an inductive model is constructed and the training stage is completed. Various tree-pruning methods can be used to prevent over-fitting. In the testing stage, the hyper-planes will progressively lead a novel pattern into a leaf. Up to this end the classification of this novel pattern is completed through assigning the class label associated with the leaf to the novel pattern. Figure 1 shows a decision tree model, where there are two variables and the whole region is divided into six sub-regions. The first hyper-plane makes a separation using the threshold value a for the variable x. Both resulting sub-regions on the left and right of the hyper-plane are not pure. The second hyper-plane divides the left sub-region generated by the first hyper-plane into two smaller sub-regions using the threshold value b for the variable y. The upper sub-region has been pure for one class while the lower sub-region is still not pure and needs more separation.",

In Kretschmann et al. (2001) C4.5 was used for protein annotation through aligning novel proteins with SWISS-PROT databank. C4.5 was also used for the prediction of phenotypes associated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes on the basis of gene ontology functional annotations from the relevant databanks (King et al., 2003). Decision trees were compared with support vector machines for the prediction of the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphisms on protein function (Krishnan and Westhead, 2003). The study shows that the decision trees have the advantage of generating interpreting rules although they have a lower prediction accuracy than support vector machines. In Li et al. (2003) decision trees were used for identifying genes related with cancer, and hence they provided knowledge for cancer diagnosis. King and his colleague studied the use of C4.5 for discovering rules for the prediction of the ORFs whose function is unknown (Clare and King, 2003). The alternative decision tree (Freund and Mason, 1999) was used for predicting the genetic regulatory response (Middendorf et al., 2004). In Selbig et al. (1999) decision trees were used for the prediction of secondary structures. Decision trees were also used in searching short and statistically significant emerging patterns for cancer diagnosis using gene expression profiles (Boulesteix et al., 2003).",

It will be illustrated later in this paper that LQSK and LQSE are cleaved 4-mers. The values 56, 48, 40, 32, 28 and 36 are obtained from the Dayhoff matrix (Johnson and Overington, 1993).

This may result from the inclusion of long non-cleaved k-mers which disrupted the modelling performance in BM1 models.",

Bio-mapping maps k-mers to a numerical space. In this numerical space, decision trees are used for mining protease data. The method has been applied to the prediction of the SARS-CoV protease cleavage sites. It has been found in the simulation that this novel method showed great success in two aspects: success in improving the prediction accuracy and success in extracting the most important k-mers as templates for decision-making. Two strategies were introduced for bio-mapping. The first strategy referred to as \u2018BM1\u2019 selects templates from all the k-mers. The second strategy referred to as \u2018BM2\u2019 selects templates only from the cleaved k-mers based on the observation made in our earlier study that most non-cleaved k-mers do not show conserved patterns. It has been found through computer simulation that the second strategy performed better.",

The most interesting work described in Hegyi and Ziebuhr (2002) has found two templates (3-mers P2P1P1\u2032) through experiments, i.e. LQS and LQA. This has also been confirmed by other researchers (Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999; Gao et al., 2003; Thiel et al., 2003; Kiemer et al., 2004).
