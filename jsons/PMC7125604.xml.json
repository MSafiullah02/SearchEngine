            "text": "There is still a need for well-designed nationwide epidemiologic studies of COPD in China. A population-based, cross-sectional survey of COPD conducted between 2002 and 2004 showed that the overall prevalence of the disease in people aged > 40 years was 8.2%,5 which would result in a COPD patient population of > 43 million in that time period. It was reported that the prevalence of COPD varied widely among locations across the country, from 5% to 13% (Table 1\n).6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Most locations had a higher prevalence of COPD than the World Health Organization model-estimated prevalence for China (6.7%)20 and the reported prevalence rates in Western countries (4%-10%).21 But the cross-sectional survey of COPD results were consistent with the pooled prevalence (meta-analysis) of the Western Pacific Region (9.0%).3 The crude prevalence of COPD was significantly higher in men than in women (8.3%-18.9% vs 3.8%-7.1%), in rural areas than in urban areas (4.4%-16.7% vs 6.7%-8.3%), in the elderly, and in nonsmoking rural women. These differences were associated with gender, smoking status, biomass fuel use, occupational dust exposure, socioeconomic status, and availability of health-care resources. It was reported that approximately two-thirds of the patients were underdiagnosed, and the prevalence of diagnosed COPD in rural areas was apparently lower than that in urban areas,21 suggesting an inferior diagnostic rate in rural areas.",

Another finding showed that COPD-related mortality in northern China was higher than in other locations;24 the higher mortality rate in the north might be associated with a colder climate, more use of biomass fuel, heavier outdoor air pollution, and lower socioeconomic status. Although mortality rates fell, hospitalization rates continued to rise in the last decade. Hospitalization rates for COPD jumped from 1.0% in 1998 (urban vs rural was 1.4% vs 0.8%) to 1.6% in 2008 (urban vs rural was 1.5% vs 1.6%). Correspondingly, the gap between rural and urban areas narrowed (Fig 1B).22 This is partially a result of the increase in incidence but it also indicates that patients in rural areas are more aware of COPD, and that resources for rural residents have been increasing. The hospitalization rate trend is consistent with that of other Asian countries.26\n",

Health-care expenses were investigated with person-to-person interviews in a cross-sectional survey conducted among 723 COPD outpatients in six large cities in China.27 It was found that the annual direct medical expense for urban patients in 2006 was $1732.24 per patient, whereas the estimated indirect expense spent on nutraceutics, transportation, and end-of-life care was $231.6 per patient. Total expense for one COPD patient ($1963.8) accounted for 40% of the average family's total income ($4849.8). Evidence showed that the cost of COPD was strongly correlated with the severity of disease and that hospitalization acted as a major contributor to total cost.26, 28 It was suggested that reducing hospitalization frequency through better management could result in a crucial decrease in health-care expenses. Moreover, the burden of COPD has been underestimated consistently because of premature mortality and impaired productivity of patients and their family members. The overall disease burden, measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was predicted to double over the next 2.5 decades worldwide, at which point COPD would move from the 13th-highest cause of DALYs worldwide to the seventh-highest by 2030. The burden of COPD in China was greater than that in developed Western countries, and it ranked second among chronic diseases as a leading cause of DALYs lost in 2001 (Fig 2\n).29\n",

Smoking the Chinese pipe was once prevalent in rural areas, but only a minority of people do it today. Smokers consumed cheaper cigarettes but spent a larger proportion of their personal income on smoking. (The cost of cigarettes per pack varied from $0.294 to $33.971 in China37). Smoking has been recognized as the most important causative factor in the pathogenesis of COPD.38 In 2005, a total of 673,000 deaths were attributed to smoking in China, whereas 268,000, 146,200, and 66,800 deaths were attributed to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, respectively.39 In another case-control study, conducted from 2000 to 2001 in Nanjing, a significant dose-response relationship between COPD and total amount of cigarettes smoked was detected after adjusting for other risk factors. The study further showed that women smokers were more susceptible to COPD.21, 40\n",

Univariate analysis showed a significant association between COPD and exposure to biomass fuel for cooking.50 In a retrospective cohort study, installation of chimneys on household coal stoves led to a substantial reduction in COPD incidence.53 Other evidence showed that when biomass fuel was used in cooking and/or heating, the exposure time and ventilation status in the kitchen/living room were associated with COPD prevalence.5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 52 Biomass smoke may interact with cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis of COPD, with ORs of 4.39 and 2.55 for cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, respectively.51 A meta-analysis of many epidemiologic studies demonstrated that if the status of smoking and solid-fuel use persists, then 65 million deaths from COPD can be expected, and 82% of COPD deaths between now and 2033 will be attributed to the combined effect of smoking and solid-fuel use, whereas 26 million deaths from COPD will be avoided by reducing smoking and solid-fuel use with intermediate magnitude. Halving solid-fuel use would lower the annual number of COPD cases by 2.2 million in men and by 4.3 million in women.45, 54 Along with rapid development of the economy and urbanization in most rural areas, indoor air pollution and ventilation in the kitchen would be gradually improved and the negative influence of biomass fuel use on health would be expected to decrease.",

There is an urgent need to understand the present and future burden of COPD in China from well-designed epidemiologic studies on its prevalence and morbidity. Because of ethnic differences, studies on genetic susceptibility to COPD among the Chinese population should be carried out to improve prevention and lead to early diagnosis. Because China is the world's largest cigarette manufacturer and because it is the world's largest consumer of cigarettes, there is a great challenge to restrict and regulate smoking in China with an intent to reduce the burden of COPD. During the last decade, smoking prevention and cessation programs have been implemented widely and preliminary results have been observed (Tables 2\n, 3\n).29, 99, 100 However, there are many factors affecting the execution of smoking laws and regulations by the government. Rural workers, teenagers, and women with high or rising rates of smoking need to be targeted specifically for tobacco-control measures. The existing public health policies should be strengthened and new strategies, including raising taxes and the price of cigarettes, should be put into effect. On the other hand, physicians should take the leading role in the fight against smoking. It has been found that about 40% of male physicians are current smokers,101 which adds to the difficulty of smoking control.",

Screening by spirometry is impractical in most primary care settings and rural areas, indicating the urgent need for disease-specific biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis and identify high-risk populations.102, 103 Management techniques of COPD should take into consideration cultural variations and mental and physical comorbidities, such as psychologic depression. Comorbidities could influence patients' quality of life, increase hospitalization, and reduce survival. The role played by finances should also be taken into account to improve the poor management of COPD. For example, the cost for drug therapy ($443-$738 per year) in the maintenance phase is a huge economic burden for families and individuals, especially for rural residents. Less than 40% of patients with chronic hypoxemia use oxygen therapy because the cost ($517 per year) is too high. It is necessary to implement a community-based comprehensive intervention, which requires support from national polices, to ensure the availability of medical resources, such as essential drugs, equipment, and human resources, and to improve the affordability of COPD therapy for patients. Continuous educational programs on quality-improving skills and management strategies should be more effective and comprehensive in China to improve health-care quality and physicians' clinical practice skills and to reduce health-care disparities among regions and economic groups.",
