Bioaerosols can be comprised of bacterial cells and cellular fragments, fungal spores and fungal hyphae, viruses, and by-products of microbial metabolism. Pollen grains and other biological material can also be airborne as a bioaerosol. Microbial aerosols are generated in outdoor and indoor environments as a result of a variety of natural and anthroprogenic activities. Wind, rain and wave splash, spray irrigation, wastewater treatment activity, cooling towers and air handling water spray systems, and agricultural processes such as harvesting and tilling are examples of activities that generate bioaerosols outdoors. Indoors bioaerosols are generated and dispersed by mechanical and human activity. Industrial and manufacturing practices and biofermentation procedures can generate high concentrations of microbial aerosols. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, water spray devices (e.g., showerheads and humidifiers), and cleaning (e.g., dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping) result in the transport of microbial materials in the air. Talking and coughing generate bioaerosols from individuals, some of which may be infectious. Facilities with medical, dental, or animal care practices can generate infectious microbial aerosols.",

Virus particles are nanometer in size, bacterial cells are approximately 1 \u00b5m in diameter, and fungal spores are >1 \u00b5m. These microorganisms can be dispersed in the air as single units, but are often present as aggregate formations. The larger aggregates have different aerodynamic properties than single-cell units; therefore their dispersal may be different than single-unit particles. Aggregates of biological material also afford protection from environmental stresses such as desiccation, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation ozone and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Often bacterial cells and virus particles are associated with skin cells, dust, and other organic or inorganic material. During agricultural practices (e.g., during harvesting, and tilling), fungus spores are released from plant surfaces and the soil and raft on other particulate matter. This \u201crafting\u201d affects the aerodynamic characteristics and the survival of the cells in the bioaerosol. When biological material is dispersed from water sources (e.g., splash, rainfall, or cooling towers and fountains), it is generally surrounded by a thin layer of water. This moisture layer also changes the aerodynamic properties and aids in the survivability of the microorganisms while airborne.",

            "text": "Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses A, B, and C. There are subtypes of influenza type A viruses based on two proteins on the surface proteins of the virus, hemaglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Many animals carry influenza A viruses, while influenza B viruses circulate among humans. Both influenza types A and B viruses cause epidemics of disease almost every winter. Influenza type C infections cause a mild respiratory illness and are not thought to cause epidemics. While symptoms can be mild, influenza may result in severe illness and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there are more than 200,000 hospital admissions and 36,000 deaths per year in the United States due to influenza. All ages can have serious illness from influenza, but those more likely to have complications are people aged 65 years and older, people with chronic medical conditions, and very young children. Transmission of influenza viruses is from person to person in respiratory droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing. The droplets are propelled usually less than 3 feet through the air and deposited on people in close proximity. The presence of the virus has been confirmed in aerosol particles within the breathable fraction in a study performed in a hospital emergency room (Blachere et al., 2009). Fomites contaminated with settled infectious droplets can also serve as a vehicle for transmission of influenza.",

Illness caused by several strains of avian influenza A viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N2, H9N2, and H7N3) have been reported since 2004. The majority of human avian influenza infections have resulted from inhalation during direct contact with infected poultry or contaminated surfaces such as avian cages, or from the ingestion of uncooked blood of infected birds. Therefore, this influenza has been popularized as \u201cbird flu.\u201d The illnesses resulting from avian influenza infection in humans range from typical mild influenza-like symptoms (e.g., fever, sore throat, cough, and muscle aches) and conjunctivitis to more serious cases of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and other severe and life-threatening complications. To date, there have been no sustained human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A viruses, but because of the potential for these viruses to gain the ability to spread easily between people, monitoring for human infection and person-to-person transmission is important. In addition, recent studies have addressed the possibility of long-range transport of both, Influenza and Avian influenza viruses, using dust storms as a vehicle to be dispersed at farther distances (Chen et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2010).",

Since then, it has also been reported in North America and Europe. It is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Exposure to SARS-CoV results from close personal contact with infected individuals. Transmission is generally the result of touching the skin of an infected person or objects contaminated with infectious droplets and then transferring the virus to the new host's eyes, nose, or mouth. Coughing or sneezing by an infected individual also releases droplets into the air that are propelled a short distance (<1 m) and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. It is possible that SARS can be spread further through the air by very small particles, and although it may be unusual, it has been confirmed in different environments (housing complex, aircraft, hospital facilities) (Wong et al., 2004, Olsen et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2004). Hand hygiene, use of gown, gloves, and eye protection when in contact with an infected individual, and use of an appropriate respirator minimizes the spread of SARS.",

Since then, a major outbreak occurred in 2015 in the Republic of Korea, and many other countries have reported positive cases (WHO, 2015). Human-to-human contact seem to be the principal way of transmission, however, its survival in aerosols has been positively tested, pointing to the airborne route as an alternative form of dispersal (van Doremalen et al., 2013). Genetic analyses of patients\u2019 specimens showed similarities between MERS-CoV and other coronavirus isolated from hedgehogs, bats and camels, suggesting their possible role as reservoirs (WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013). Despite all these data, the exact way of transmission remains on debate. Pathology may vary from asymptomatic to have a fatal outcome. It starts with mild symptoms (fever, cough, etc.) followed by pneumonia with acute respiratory distress and multi-organ failure that may lead to death in 60% of the cases (WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013, de Groot et al., 2013).",

Obstruction of airflow and exacerbation of asthma has been related to airborne endotoxin concentrations, and atopic and nonatopic asthma have been associated with endotoxin exposure because of its ability to induce inflammatory reactions. Repeated inhalation exposure has been shown to induce allergen-specific airway inflammation.

Histoplasmosis primarily affects a person's lungs, and its symptoms vary greatly. Infected people are generally asymptomatic or they experience mild flu-like symptoms not requiring medical attention. Chronic lung disease resulting from infection with H. capsulatum resembles tuberculosis, and can worsen over months or years. The most severe and rarest form of histoplasmosis occurs when it is disseminated involving spreading outside the lungs. If untreated, disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal and has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) positive people (Cano and Hajjeh, 2001).",

Continued researches and awareness by public health professionals are needed to recognize these diseases and minimize the risk of exposure of the population.
