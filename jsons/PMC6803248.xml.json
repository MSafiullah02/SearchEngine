Unlike type II FCoV infections, type I FCoV infections occur predominantly in felids worldwide (12\u201314). Furthermore, their virological features differ, including growth characteristics in cell culture and receptor usage (7, 15). Type II FCoV shows better growth kinetics than type I FCoV and can more easily induce FIP in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats. Despite the fact that type II FCoV infections occur with low frequency, many researchers employ type II FCoVs to analyze FIP pathogenesis. Therefore, a type I FCoV strain that can induce FIP is needed to fully understand FIP pathogenesis.",

This hypothesis is known as the \u201cinternal mutation theory\u201d (16\u201318) and is supported by the proposal of the presence of virulent FIP markers. On the basis of epidemiological studies, spike (S) and/or open reading frame (ORF) 3c genes of type I FCoV are thought to be virulence markers (18\u201320). However, none of the proposed markers have been proven virulent owing to the lack of feasible FIP cat models with type I FCoV. It is difficult for researchers using most type I FCoVs isolated from FIP cats to induce FIP in experimental settings using SPF cats. It is thought that adaptation of type I FCoV in tissue culture results in a loss of pathogenicity (21, 22).",

Low levels of cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed at 2 days posttransfection (dpt), and the levels became higher by 3 dpt. To determine the rates of rC3663 virus recovery, we employed reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) on isolated RNA from rC3663 and the parental strain. We further confirmed the \u0394EcoRI genetic maker by analyzing EcoRI digestion and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1C and D). Next, we analyzed the virological features of the rC3663 virus by comparing the growth kinetics of rC3663 and parental C3663 in Fcwf-4 cells after inoculating them with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The results showed that the growth kinetics of rC3663 was similar to that of the parental C3663 (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we compared levels of viral RNA replication in parental C3663-infected and rC3663-infected Fcwf-4 cells by Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 1F) and found that the amounts of genomic RNA (gRNA) and of sg mRNAs in rC3663-infected Fcwf-4 cells were similar to those seen with the parental C3663-infected cells (Fig. 1F). Taking the results together, we were able to successfully generate infectious cDNA clones derived from type I FCoV strain C3663 using the BAC system. Our results indicate that the recovered rC3663 virus possesses virological features identical to those possessed by the parental C3663 virus (Fig. 1E and F).",

Using an anti-FCoV N monoclonal antibody (MAb), N protein expression in A72 cells was observed by IFA, and the A72 cells exhibited small foci at 48 hpi compared with those exhibited by Fcwf-4 cells (Fig. 3F). Therefore, infectious particles were found to have been generated in A72 cells at a low efficiency of infection expansion by progeny particles to neighboring cells. We also examined N protein expression levels using immunoblotting. As expected, N protein expression levels in rC3663 virus-infected A72 cells were significantly low (Fig. 3G). Although the levels of production of progeny virus and N protein were low, our results suggest that canine-derived A72 cells represent a permissive cell line for type I FCoV infections without cytotoxic effects.",

These results led us to speculate that the entry receptor for type I FCoV is perhaps not expressed in MDCK and DH82 cells or that viral RNA replication of type I FCoV is not permitted in these cell lines. Unfortunately, the type I FCoV receptor remains unknown. Thus, we examined viral replication levels in cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc. As a negative control, we generated pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead by mutating the active site of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; nsp12) from SDD to SAA (Fig. 4A) and confirmed that virus rescue did not occur in Fcwf-4 cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead because of disrupted RdRp activity (data not shown). After transfecting MDCK cells with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc or pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead together with pcDNA3.1-fluc, we determined the levels of luciferase activity in cell lysates at 24, 48, and 72 h posttransfection (Fig. 4B, with firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pcDNA3.1-fluc (32) used as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 4B, Nluc expression levels in cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc were comparable to those in cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead. Consistent with the luciferase assay results (Fig. 4B), no progeny virus was produced in MDCK cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc (Fig. 4C). In addition, no increases in the levels of viral RNA (Fig. 4D) or N protein expression (Fig. 4E) were observed in MDCK cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc. Thus, our results indicate that MDCK cells do not permit replication of C3663 virus RNA.",

Recently, we found that type I FCoV strain C3663 has the ability to induce FIP in SPF cats (9). Thus, in the present study, we constructed an infectious cDNA clone derived from the virulence-retaining type I FCoV strain C3663 by utilizing the BAC system. As a result, we successfully rescued recombinant type I FCoV by transfection of the BAC cDNA clone into Fcwf-4 cells, where the recovered rC3663 showed growth kinetics similar to that of the parental virus (Fig. 1). In addition, we generated recombinant type I FCoV carrying Nluc as a reporter gene and applied our reporter rC3663 virus to drug screening (Fig. 2).",

Yamamoto et al. showed that nafamostat inhibited Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection by inhibiting TMPRSS2 (34). Consistent with these findings, we identified nafamostat mesylate (compound 38) as an FCoV inhibitor that shows no cytotoxic effects, suggesting that FCoV utilizes the host protease TMPRSS2 for entry. Another compound, lopinavir, is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease and is used for AIDS treatment (35). In coronavirus infections, lopinavir inhibits MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and human CoV (HCoV) 229E infection by inhibiting the CoV 3C-like protease (29). HCoV-229E belongs to the same genus as FCoV\u2014Alphacoronavirus (3). Unsurprisingly, we identified lopinavir (compound 31) as an FCoV inhibitor that does not exhibit cytotoxicity. Our results suggest nafamostat and lopinavir as potential therapeutic agents against FCoV infection.",

If chemical compounds can suppress the viral load of type I FCoV in kittens, then the probability of disease onset should be reduced.

Feline aminopeptidase N (APN) works as a viral receptor for type II CCoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (15, 49), suggesting that cats, and especially kittens, play an important role in producing new chimeric viruses. However, the possibility of recombination in other animals, such as dogs, has not been well-studied. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no reports have shown type I FCoV induction of apparent CPE in cell culture except for Fcwf-4 cells. Indeed, the C3663 strain of type I FCoV did not exhibit CPE in canine-derived cells (Fig. 3C). However, the level of luciferase activity in A72 cells infected with the rC3663-Nluc virus was significantly increased without concomitant CPE (Fig. 3A and C), and although the progeny virus production levels were low, A72 cells permitted type I FCoV replication (Fig. 3D). We reasoned that investigations of type I FCoV infectivity in other cell lines should not rely solely on CPE-based assays. Furthermore, our findings indicate that events of recombination between type I FCoV and CCoV may occur in dogs. Specifically, type I FCoV may be transmitted from cats to dogs and a new CoV may emerge in dogs through recombination events. In fact, CCoV replicates in A72 cells (50).",

However, other animal species are also potential novel virus reservoirs; for example, Lau et al. reported that the Deltacoronavirus porcine CoV HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) can be transmitted from birds to pigs (57). In addition, HCoV OC43 is known to originate from bovine CoV (58). Therefore, not only bats but also other animal species should be investigated for their potential as reservoirs or sources of emerging viruses.

Therefore, the increase in viral RNA in A72 cells (Fig. 3D) was possibly caused by the synthesis of sg mRNA6 (Fig. 5A). To our knowledge, there are no reports on aberrant RNA transcription of CoVs in infected cells, such as in A72 cells. Several host proteins, such as members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family or the DEAD box RNA helicase family, interact with the TRS of CoV RNA and regulate transcription/replication (60). Thus, our data indicate that a host factor(s) present in Fcwf-4 cells, but not in A72 cells, regulates viral RNA transcription. On the basis of the aberrant expression of viral mRNA seen in rC3663 virus-infected A72 cells, further studies are required for uncovering the CoV RNA transcription mechanisms in A72 cells.",

Our recombinant virus can potentially be used to expand research on type I FCoV-induced FIP. Furthermore, infection of the A72 cells with the rC3663 virus revealed unusual viral mRNA expression patterns that may provide novel insights into the mechanisms of CoV transcription. Although further study is required to test whether the recombinant virus can induce FIP in vivo, our established type I FCoV clone has the potential to be a powerful tool for understanding FIP pathogenesis. For example, because the S gene is a candidate for FCoV pathogenesis (19, 20), a chimeric S gene virus corresponding to our recombinant virus may provide novel insights into type I FCoV pathogenesis. Additionally, other groups have previously established type I FCoV reverse genetics using the Black strain (26) and type I field virus (61); thus, exploiting multiple approaches can synergistically further our understanding of FIP.",

The full-length genomic sequence of C3663 was divided into 11 fragments that were then assembled into pBeloBAC11 plasmids in sequential order (Fig. 1A). Fragments Fr1, Fr2, Fr3, Fr4, Fr5, Fr6, Fr7, Fr8, Fr9, Fr10, and Fr11 correspond to nt 11218 to 13811, nt 13812 to 16360, nt 16361 to 18675, nt 18676 to 20998, nt 20999 to 23400, nt 23401 to 26227, nt 9210 to 11217, nt 26228 to 28545, nt 1 to 2069, nt 2070 to 5152, and nt 5153 to 9834, respectively. Red/ET recombination was employed for fragment integration with a Red/ET recombination system counterselection BAC modification kit (Gene Bridges, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (32). The cDNA corresponding to the 3\u02b9 end of the genomic RNA between nt 28046 and 28545 with 25 nt of adenine (pA) and a partial HDV ribozyme (Rz) sequence was generated by chemical synthesis (Eurofins, Brussels, Belgium); this cDNA was used as a PCR template for synthesizing Fr8 (Fig. 1A). For synthesizing other fragments, RT-PCR was carried out using genomic RNA of the C3663 strain as described under \u201cRNA extraction and RT-PCR\u201d (see below). For Fr11 amplification, reverse primer YT648 (5\u02b9-TTTGCCTTATAACTTCCGTAGGTGTAAACTCATCACATAATGAGCCATAAGACA-3\u02b9) was designed to disrupt the EcoRI site of C3663 between nt 9829 and nt 9834 (Fig. 1B). The cDNA clone carrying the full-length C3663 sequence was designated pBAC-FCoV-C3663. Sequence analysis of the full-genome sequence of C3663 in pBAC-FCoV-C3663 was carried out by Eurofins. For construction of reporter rC3663, we replaced the ORF 3abc genes of pBAC-FCoV-C3663 with Nluc (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) using the recombination method described above (Fig. 2A) and designated the infectious cDNA clone pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc. The same recombination method was applied for the construction of pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead, which possesses amino acid substitutions (SDD to SAA) at the active site of RdRp (nsp12; Fig. 4A).",
