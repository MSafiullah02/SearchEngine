However, their effectiveness is heavily dependent on their installation rate, which may be influenced by people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential privacy risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user identity and location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, N = 208). The six app designs covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals.",

We also found that the majority of our sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations in public places to show hotspots of infection. Our results suggest that apps using a centralized architecture with strong security protection to do basic contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the U.S. We also offer some recommendations on how to communicate the risks and benefits of contact tracing apps with the general public.",

Given the high adoption rate of smartphones (currently over 80% in the U.S. in 2020 [4] ) and their rich sensing capabilities (e.g., BLE-based proximity sensing and location-based tracking), these apps can automate the laborious work of tracing back users' contact history to help find who an infected person has been in contact with recently (e.g., in the last 14 days.) These apps can provide notice to users of their potential exposure to the virus and guide them to take tests and to self-quarantine. They can also gather information to help epidemiologists monitor the spread of the disease, discover disease hotspots, and contact exposed individuals. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the adoption rate, which has been demonstrated to be challenging due to people's concerns about issues such as privacy [5, 6, 7] . Ferretti et al.

Also, the app may require users to provide their real identity information to better integrate the tool into part of the normal workflow of contact tracers. However, the more information that is disclosed to the app, the greater the privacy risks that users of the app can be exposed to. This involves a classic problem in privacy, namely how people manage tradeoffs between privacy and utility.

However, none of them has connected these abstract factors to concrete app-design choices to provide guidelines on designing and deploying COVID-19 apps that can achieve optimal adoption rates. There is a large design space for contact-tracing apps, each with different functionality as well as implications for privacy. Evaluating these differences can help us better understand how people view the privacy-utility trade-offs, and lead to better designs that more people are likely to adopt.",

In both architectures, users' phones can generate many ephemeral identifiers based on user identifiers, broadcast them using a channel (BLE or ultrasound), and record the broadcasted identifiers they have received. In a centralized architecture, contact tracing is done on centralized servers that ask infected users to upload all the broadcasted identifiers they have received. Then they can decode them to the identities of exposed users, which allows health authorities to notify these users. In this setup, users will only know one bit of information: whether they were recently exposed to an infected user or not. Note that we only discuss centralized architecture that requires user's identity in this paper (e.g., phone number in BlueTrace [13] ), since the other alternatives (such as ROBERT [14, 15] ) provide few additional utility benefits while introducing more privacy risks (see Section 3.1). Therefore, for centralized contact-tracing apps, the identity information of app users and their status (infected, exposed, or other) may be accessible by health workers, app developers, and state/federal-level health authorities (depending on at what level the app is deployed).",

However, if different apps are going to be deployed for different states, then the varying preferences in states with different partisan leanings should be taken into account. If centralized solutions are adopted, the app should verify every user's identity to prevent malicious users from identifying infected users by signing up multiple accounts. Also it will be especially important to apply strong security protections to prevent data breaches, and make sure the collected data is only used for the purposes specified to users when requesting consent to access the data. \u2022 App Design: Location Sharing: In addition to supporting basic contact-tracing functionality, providing users with more useful information may nudge more people to install the app. For example, releasing the aggregated whereabouts of infected users has been suggested as a useful feature with acceptable privacy risks and considerable utility benefits. Due to the different levels of acceptance to sharing location history, as suggested by our clustering analysis results in Section 4.3, the app should request the location collection in a progressive way, and provide users with sufficient control regarding to what extent their location could be released to the public (e.g., sharing all location, sharing location in public areas only, not sharing location, etc.) \u2022 Design of Privacy Notices: These apps should be transparent about the risks of disclosing personal information, both to governments (for centralized designs) and to tech-savvy users (for decentralized designs). Decentralized solutions should not be posited as a risk-free solution, since people seem to have more problem with tech-savvy users identifying them (as in decentralized designs) than health workers and health authorities doing so (as in centralized designs).",

However, details of their algorithm have not been released. TraceTogether and its BLE-based protocol BlueTrace [13] , made by the Singapore government, supports contact tracing by collecting IDs of exposed users and mapping the IDs to their phone numbers on a centralized server. PEPP-PT [27] , a joint effort between France, Germany, and Italy, proposed a centralized design using BLE-based proximity sensing. South Korea's contact tracing solution [22] uses the location history of infected patients as collected from cell towers to inform people that have potentially been in high-risk areas. India's contact-tracing app CoWin-20 [28] requires a user's position and BLE-based proximity data, but the details of their algorithm has not yet been released.

In this paper we focused on apps that support proximity-based contact tracing and location-based hotspot reporting. These contact-tracing apps can generally be divided by whether the contact tracing is done on a centralized server [13, 27] or done on every user's phone in a decentralized way [10, 20, 29, 30, 16, 31, 33] . Our survey investigates app designs for both types of apps, with the exception that we only consider centralized contact-tracing apps that require user's identity when signing-up.

These questions have only one correct answer, and are a common technique in survey studies to check whether the respondents are paying attention to the Table 2 : The six app design options abstracted based on design choices from the two design dimensions presented in Table 1 . App 1-2 and 4-5 only collect coarse-grained location history (e.g.,~1000m/3000ft accuracy), and release infected users' location history to the public. Note that not all six app designs can match exactly with a real world app. Some may follow a similar design (e.g., the Germany contact-tracing app that used a centralized design), but had certain flaws in their implementation which could cause more data to be leaked [10]. While stay-at-home orders slow down the spread of the disease, they also impose a lot of restrictions on our everyday life and severely impact the economy. Digital contact tracing technologies provide a potential solution that may better balance the need to control the disease and re-open the economy.",

A recent study by the Washington Post suggested that one's partisan leaning could affect people's willingness to install contact-tracing apps in general, and identified that people who self-identified as Republicans were less amenable to install contact-tracing apps [11] . In a similar spirit, we separate our responses into two groups based on the 2016 United States presidential election results of the states they currently reside in. Although centralized designs and public location only achieved significant positive effect on willingness to install the app, the corresponding effect sizes (odds ratio, abbreviated as OR in Table 4 ) of the Blue states are consistently larger than the Red states, which suggests that the most suitable app design in different states may vary according to partisan leanings. Odds ratio (OR) quantifies the strength of the association between the dependent variable (willingness to install) and the independent variable (design choices). If OR is larger than 1, it means there is a positive effect on willingness to install of this design choice, and the larger the OR the greater the effect; If OR is smaller than 1, it means there is a negative effect on willingness to install of this design choice, and the smaller the OR the greater the effect.

            "text": "Although previous results have suggested that people prefer centralized solutions and prefer apps that provide them with hotspot information despite the cost of location privacy, we do not yet fully understand what factors contribute to this difference. This section aims to answer this question by analyzing the ratings of individual factors and the free-form explanations for pairwise app design comparisons. Table 4 : Logistic regression between app install preferences and app design choices. The dependent variable is whether to install the app (Strongly agree or agree = 1, Other = 0), and the independent variables are the app choices (e.g., centralized vs. decentralized, collect all location vs. collect location in public areas vs. do not collect location.) The first two models suggest that centralized designs and collecting location in public areas are better choices at country level that can result in higher installation rates. We then separate participants into two groups based on who their states voted for in the 2016 United States presidential election. Although centralized designs and public location only achieved significant positive effect on willingness to install the app, the corresponding effect sizes (OR) of the Blue state group are consistently larger than the Red states, which suggests that the most suitable app design at state level may vary according to the partisan leanings. We first analyzed the sensitivity of different sharing targets. Figure 5 shows a trend that people are generally more comfortable with having their location data and identity information accessible by health workers, state-level health authorities, and federal-level health authorities (with more than half agreed to share), and less comfortable with having the same data accessible by app developers, tech-savvy users and the public (with more than half disagree to share). We also conducted statistical analysis to verify the above observations. Specifically, we tested the difference between ratings related to sharing data with tech-savvy users and ratings related to sharing data with state/federal-level health authorities, and observed a significant difference (U = 1556559.5, p < .001.) This shows that our participants were generally more concerned about tech-savvy users inferring their identities (happens in a decentralized solution [10]) than health authorities (happens in a centralized solution), which explains why more people preferred to install apps that followed centralized design. We also tested the difference between ratings related to sharing data with state-level health authorities and ratings related to sharing data with federal-level authorities, and did not get a statistically significant result (U = 527568.5, p = 0.32.)",

The second one \"Toss-up condition\" shows that sometimes people find two conditions to be equally good or bad. The last code \"No matching explanation\" is used when the responses are too vague to be understood (no information) or seem to convey ideas that seem to contradict the design choices (mismatch). There were 3% (22 out of 750) mismatched responses in total and some reflect misconceptions about the app designs. This will be further discussed in the limitations.
