Feline osteoclastic resorptive lesions (FORL) involve extensive resorption of the tooth leaving it liable to root fracture and subsequent tooth loss. The aetio-pathogenesis of FORL is not known. Recent work has shown that systemic acidosis causes increased osteoclast activation and that loci of infection or inflammation in cat mouth are likely to be acidotic. To investigate this, we generated osteoclasts from cat blood and found that they formed in large numbers ($400) in cultures on bovine cortical bone slices. Acidosis caused an increase in the size of cells-in cultures maintained up to 14 days at basal pH 7.25, mean osteoclast area was 0.01 AE 0.003 mm 2 , whereas an 8.6-fold increase was observed in cells cultured between 11 and 14 days at pH 7.15 (0.086 AE 0.004 mm 2 ). Acidosis caused a modest increase in the number of osteoclasts. Exposure to pH 6.92 exhibited a 5-fold increase in the area of bone slices covered by resorption lacunae ($70% bone slice resorbed). In line with this finding, significant increases were observed in the expression of cathepsin K and proton pump enzymes (both approximately 3-fold) that are key enzymes reflective of resorptive activity in osteoclasts. These results demonstrate that acidosis is a major regulator of osteoclast formation and functional activation in the cat, and suggest that local pH changes may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of FORL.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "As veterinary science has developed, it has been realized that musculo-skeletal diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality (Leonard and Tillson, 2001) , and several conditions involve increased bone resorption by osteoclasts. These include; metabolic bone diseases (e.g., hypervitaminosis A, nutritional, and secondary hyperparathyroidism) (Clark, 1970; Barber and Elliott, 1998) , neoplasia (Heldmann et al., 2000) , arthritis (Bennett, 1995) , disuse osteopenia and nonunion fractures (Hill, 1977) . ''Feline osteoclastic resorption lesions'' (FORL) (Okuda and Harvey, 1992; Reiter, 1998; Lommer and Verstraete, 2000 )-external resorptive lesions or ''neck'' lesions of the tooth-are common in domestic cats. The characteristic lesions leave an ''apple core'' shape that is liable to root fracture and tooth loss with subsequent pain and morbidity (Lyon, 1992; Gengler et al., 1995; Heaton et al., 2004) . Epidemiological studies have shown that up to 75% of cats are affected with at least one lesion during life, and there appears to be an increased incidence of disease after 4 years of age. FORL initiate on the external surface of the root, and extend to involve dentine and enamel and rarely involve the pulp, except in advanced stages of the disease (Okuda and Harvey, 1992) . At early stages of FORL, lesions appear as small, localized pits at the gingival margin of the crown of the tooth (Okuda and Harvey, 1992; DeLaurier et al., 2005) . Resorption is associated with gingival inflammation and proliferation, which may involve the presence of extensive dental plaque, and the formation of vascular granulation tissue filling the expanding lesion. At advanced stages of disease, the lesion extends into the underlying dentine, and the tooth structure is significantly resorbed. Ultimately, the crown fractures, and the remaining fragments of root are resorbed (Okuda and Harvey, 1992; Reiter, 1998; DeLaurier et al., 2005) . Histological studies have demonstrated the presence of large numbers of osteoclasts on the external surface of the tooth root at early stages of the disease, whereas few are detected at advanced stages of disease and during the initiation of repair response (Okuda and Harvey, 1992) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 167, "text": "(Leonard and Tillson, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 357, "end": 370, "text": "(Clark, 1970;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 371, "end": 396, "text": "Barber and Elliott, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 409, "end": 432, "text": "(Heldmann et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 445, "end": 460, "text": "(Bennett, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 504, "end": 516, "text": "(Hill, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 569, "end": 593, "text": "(Okuda and Harvey, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 594, "end": 607, "text": "Reiter, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 608, "end": 635, "text": "Lommer and Verstraete, 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 867, "end": 879, "text": "(Lyon, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 880, "end": 901, "text": "Gengler et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 902, "end": 922, "text": "Heaton et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1300, "text": "(Okuda and Harvey, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1441, "text": "(Okuda and Harvey, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1465, "text": "DeLaurier et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1913, "text": "(Okuda and Harvey, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1927, "text": "Reiter, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1928, "end": 1951, "text": "DeLaurier et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2236, "text": "(Okuda and Harvey, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The consensus is that FORL is not related to caries lesions or to periodontal diseases.

Osteoclasts are known to be formed from cells of the ''monocytoid lineage,'' and precursors have been shown to reside in both the immature colony forming unit population and more mature CD14 \u00fe monocytes; a distinct osteoclast lineage precursor, CFU-O, has been proposed to be capable of responding rapidly to RANKL (Atkins et al., 2006) . Cell-to-cell contact is also necessary for osteoclast formation since they form by cell fusion rather than endomitosis (Suda et al., 1992) . Currently, several cell surface molecules have been reported to be involved in this process and it had been established that RANK signaling together with additional signaling through c-Fms, the receptor for M-CSF, promotes survival, proliferation, and fusion of mononuclear osteoclast precursors (Boyle et al., 2003; Ross and Teitelbaum, 2005; Vignery, 2005) . In both co-cultures and M-CSF/RANKL stimulated systems, osteoclast formation proceeds in stages (Quinn and Gillespie, 2005) , and at least 20 genes have been shown to regulate osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. Some act during the formation and/or survival of the osteoclast precursor cell (e.g., PU.1, op/CSF-1), whereas others mediate either the ability of the precursor cell to undergo differentiation (e.g., RANK, fos) or the adherence and lytic function of mature osteoclasts (e.g., src, CATK) (reviewed in Boyle et al., 2003) . Furthermore, the interaction between RANKL, produced by osteoblasts, and its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclast precursors, leads to activation of at least five signaling cascades (inhibitor of NF-kB kinase (IKK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Src) that culminate in activation of transcription factors NF-kB and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT-2) (reviewed in Boyle et al., 2003) . Additionally, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is a chemokine highly expressed by bone endothelium, marrow stromal cells, and immature osteoblasts and directly promotes early osteoclast development by stimulating precursor proliferation, fusion, TRAP activity, and cell survival by induction of anti-apoptotic transcription factors (Wright et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 463, "end": 484, "text": "(Atkins et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 606, "end": 625, "text": "(Suda et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 924, "end": 944, "text": "(Boyle et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 945, "end": 971, "text": "Ross and Teitelbaum, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 972, "end": 986, "text": "Vignery, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1112, "text": "(Quinn and Gillespie, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1531, "text": "Boyle et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1990, "text": "Boyle et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2340, "end": 2361, "text": "(Wright et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Relatively little research has been carried out on osteoclast development and regulation of bone resorption in the domestic cat.

In contrast, osteoclasts isolated from neonatal mouse bone or grown in vitro are small and frequently have less than five nuclei. These observations are in line with our culture experiments where the largest osteoclasts that we observed had a maximum cell area of up to $13 mm 2 after 14 days of culture and often contained several hundred nuclei. These gigantic osteoclasts were functionally highly active, each associated with numerous F-actin rings and resorption lacunae, and frequently resorbed the entire surface of bone slices (the mean area resorbed at pH <7.1 after 14 days culture being greater than 60%). Osteoclasts even formed at the extremes of culture pH studied, especially when ''mature'' osteoclast cultures had their pH modified; these still resorbed bone though to a diminished extent compared with basal conditions.

In the diseased oral cavity, pH is likely to be even lower and this raises the question of how ''acidosis'' impacts the levels of control of osteoclast development and function, the available data only rarely coming from felines. Frick and Bushinsky (2003) found that metabolic acidosis significantly increased the expression of RANKL RNA, correlating with calcium efflux from bone; indomethacin blocked this effect, indicating a role for prostaglandins. Acidosis also increases osteoblastic secretion of PGE2, which is known to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption (Krieger et al., 2000) . Several classes of protein could function as extra-cellular pH sensor(s) within the pH range at which extra-cellular acidification activates and stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone, but they are yet to be studied in cat osteoclasts. They include the H \u00fe -sensing G-protein-coupled receptor, OGR1, which is expressed by osteoclasts and osteoblasts (Ludwig et al., 2003) ; the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICS), several of which are expressed in bone (Jahr et al., 2005) ; the P2X2 receptor for extra-cellular ATP (North, 2002) , also present in osteoclasts; and the TRP cation channel (van der Eerden et al., 2005) . Although the mechanism by which osteoclasts detect pH changes is still elusive, progress has been made in understanding the response of the key resorptive enzymes to extra-cellular acidification, reflected in the data from this study. Acidosis rapidly stimulates the activity of the vacuolar-type H \u00fe -ATPase in osteoclasts (Nordstrom et al., 1997) and induces mRNA for carbonic anhydrase II (Biskobing and Fan, 2000) . Furthermore, a recent study by Brandao-Burch et al.
