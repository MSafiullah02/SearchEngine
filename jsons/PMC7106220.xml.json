The cellular and molecular mechanisms of DTH reactions have been intensively studied. During the lymphocyte localization and infiltration to inflammatory locus, lymphocytes should interact with endothelial cells and the underlying basement membrane and extracellular matrix [2], [3]. In the process of these immune responses, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to degrade basement membrane and extracellular matrix and to enhance the inflammatory infiltration of T lymphocytes into target tissues [4]. Furthermore, there are increasing evidences that some kinds of monoclonal antibodies and synthetic peptides could ameliorate inflammation via inhibiting lymphocyte adhesion to extracellular matrix [3], [5], [6]. These findings demonstrated that inhibition on T cell adhesion and interference with the activities of the proteinases including MMPs may represent a useful approach to the treatment of T cell-mediated immune diseases.",

            "text": "To find such an approach, in addition to the immunosuppressants and anti-inflammatory agents, research has also been focused on the effect of various traditional Chinese medicines. Many extracts from Chinese herbs and their principles have been evidenced to improve T cell-mediated diseases, such as hepatitis and arthritis, via inhibiting the T cell function [7], [8], [9], [10]. Our group has also found the strong effect of a traditional Chinese prescription, Si-Ni-San, in treating immunological liver injury and contact sensitivity [11], [12]. These effects of the prescription have also been recognized to be related to the inhibition on the T cell functions. Si-Ni-San written in the Treatise on Febrile diseases, a medical classic by Zhongjing Zhang in East Han Dynasty, comprises an equal ratio of four Chinese medicines: Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri Chinensis), Shaoyao (Radix Paeoniae Alba), Zhishi (Fructus Citri Aurantii) and Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis). This ancient prescription has been believed to be effective in curing some inflammatory diseases and widely used as a mediation recipe to treat hepatitis, gastritis, neuralgia, appendagitis during the long history of China [13], [14], [15]. Among the herbal drugs composed in the prescription, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis Fisch (licorice) is a common medicinal herb in traditional Chinese medicine. In clinics, it is used to treat hepatitis, diabetes, and peptic ulcer [16]. As a major component of licorice root, glycyrrhizin, consists of glycyrrhetic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid (Fig. 1\n). So far, glycyrrhizin exhibits a number of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammation, anti-ulcer, anti-allergy, anti-carcinogenesis, and immunomodulation [17], [18], [19], [20]. The compound is also used as a potential therapeutic agent for several virus diseases, including chronic hepatitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and herpes infection [21], [22], [23], [24]. Recently glycyrrhizin was also proved to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [25]. Taking these reports into consideration, we presumed that glycyrrhizin might make an important contribution to the pharmacological efficacy of Si-Ni-San. Although Si-Ni-San has been widely used in clinics and its action mechanisms have been partially elucidated [11], [12], the active constituents and the pharmacological properties of their potency are not sufficiently clarified yet. For exploring the active principles of a Chinese herb and its blended prescription, a common method is to isolate the compounds contained by a chemical purification or the activity-guided purification [26]. Such assay is usually based on the activity of purified compounds but difficult to reflect the actual contribution of the compound in total prescription.",

Its selectivity is derived from the use of an immobilized specific biomolecule, such as antibodies, receptors and specific proteins. In the aspect of traditional Chinese medicines, antibodies to the chemical principles contained in the crude materials have been made and applied to the quantitative determination of some active compounds in various traditional Chinese prescriptions or herbs by using ELISA [28]. In order to obtain antibodies against the components, the compounds are usually bound with a protein, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the complex is then used as an antigen. According to these findings, in the present study, we designed to make the antibody vs glycyrrhizin, and then we tried to selectively deplete glycyrrhizin from Si-Ni-San to define the role of the compound in the whole Si-Ni-San in inhibiting ear contact sensitivity, a typical delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, with regard to lymphocyte adhesion and MMP production.",

They were mixed in an equal ratio (25 g of each drug; in total 100 g) to make up Si-Ni-San, a mixed powder of material crude drugs. These materials were used for making 70% ethanol extracts as reported with small modification. Briefly, the materials (100 g) were extracted twice with 5-fold volumes of 70% ethanol (500 mL) at 70 \u00b0C for 1 h each time. Then the supernatant, after centrifuging at 2000 \u00d7g, was pooled and lyophilized to make a powder with 23.2% yields for Si-Ni-San. The dosages of these extracts were indicated as the powders. The contents of main components in the 70% ethanol extracts of Si-Ni-San were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as 0.25% of saikosaponin a, 1.0% of paeoniflorin, 2.7% of naringin and 4.6% of glycyrrhizin.

Since Si-Ni-San contains high content of glycyrrhizin, which possesses a wide range of pharmacological properties including strong anti-inflammatory activity, the activity of Si-Ni-San at 200 mg/kg was compared with this major component according to its amount (10 mg/kg) contained in 200 mg/kg Si-Ni-San. As the result, both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin showed a significant inhibition on the ear swelling though the inhibition intensity by glycyrrhizin was less than that by Si-Ni-San at the used doses (Table 1). This finding suggests that glycyrrhizin, at least, is one of the main components contained in Si-Ni-San to interfere with the activation of T lymphocytes involved in the ear inflammation.",

Immunorecognition methods carried out in chromatographic columns can be used for both isolation and analysis [34]. It has been reported that some monoclonal or polyconal antibodies against various bioactive natural products have been made to develop new ELISA methods for the quantification of principles in crude drugs or prescription samples [28]. However, using these antibodies to deplete specific component in traditional Chinese prescription has not been reported yet. In the present study, the antibody raised against glycyrrhizin was covalently bound to the chromatographic packing. The coupling efficiency defined as the percentage of immobilized antibody accounted for the original amount, was observed to be 87%. Then Si-Ni-San extract was passed through this imunoaffinity column, where glycyrrhizin was captured and concentrated by the glycyrrhizin antibody while the rest of components of the samples were eluted. In Fig. 4, we observed the content of glycyrrhizin in Si-Ni-San decreased greatly after passed through the column, accounting for about 95.5% of the original amount. This result indicated that glycyrrhizin has been selectively depleted from Si-Ni-San by this approach.",

The adhesion activity of the spleen cells was significantly enhanced when the cells were stimulated by protein kinase C (PKC) activator, PMA in vitro. Against the increase, the pretreatment with Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin significantly inhibited the adhesion almost to the normal level. However, the glycyrrhizin-depleted sample of Si-Ni-San only showed a slight inhibition. In other words, the depletion of glycyrrhizin significantly blocked the inhibition of Si-Ni-San on the lymphocyte adhesion (Fig. 5).

As many reports indicated, MMPs that can degrade extracellular matrix is indispensable for the adhesion of lymphocytes to extracellular matrix. Excretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 conspicuously increases when the integrins on T cell surface bind to their ligands in extracellular matrix [35]. In Fig. 6, we observed the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 produced by spleen lymphocytes from antigen-sensitized mice. Such production of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was remarkably inhibited by Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin. However, once glycyrrhizin was depleted from Si-Ni-San, the extract only showed a slight inhibition. These results suggested that glycyrrhizin also plays an important role in the inhibition efficacy of Si-Ni-San on MMPs production.",

For instance, saikosaponins from Radix Bupleuri were well known to have excellent anti-inflammatory activity [36]; paeoniflorin from Radix Paeoniae showed a potent analgesic action [37]; and naringin from Fructus Citri Aurantii had antioxidant effects in cholesterol-fed rabbits [38]. All these findings as well as those on the biological activities of glycyrrhizin so far, were obtained by pharmacological assays using the purified compounds. However, in these investigations, it is usually difficult to know whether the compounds actually act in the total prescription. On the other hand, our previous study focused on the effect of Si-Ni-San and its effective constituents on T cell-mediated disease models. Our data demonstrated that the activities of Si-Ni-San were better than its single herbs on the animal inflammation. By analyzing the composition of Si-Ni-San, we found that the effect of this prescription was mainly contributed by the combination of Chaihu and Shaoyao, as well as Shaoyao and Gancao [12]. We also found that saikosaponin mainly inhibited T lymphocyte activation and proliferation (unpublished data), while glycyrrhizin showed strong inhibition on T lymphocyte adhesion to extracellular matrix and MMPs secretion (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). These data indicated a fact that Si-Ni-San showed an integrated effect from many components contained and there still remain a lot of questions. From this view, the attempt to specifically deplete one or more components from a traditional Chinese prescription as used in the present study may be helpful for the elucidation of the activity of traditional Chinese medicines. Overall, glycyrrhizin may act as an active constituent of Si-Ni-San in inhibiting DTH reaction involving down-regulation of MMPs production and the cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. A further study of the detailed mechanisms is now in progress.",
