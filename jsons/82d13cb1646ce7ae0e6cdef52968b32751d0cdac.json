            "text": "Background: Inconsistencies exist regarding the severity of illness caused by different influenza strains. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adults and adolescents with influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p) from type A and type B strains in China. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from Flu-p patients in five hospitals in China from January 2013 to May 2019. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of influenza virus subtypes on clinical outcomes, and to explore the risk factors of 30-day mortality for Flu-p patients. Results: In total, 963 laboratory-confirmed influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) and 386 influenza B-related pneumonia (FluB-p) patients were included. Upon adjustment for confounders, multivariate logistic regression models showed that FluA-p was associated with an increased risk of invasive ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.824, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.279-6.414; P < 0.001), admittance to intensive care unit (aOR: 1.630, 95% CI: 1.074-2.473, P = 0.022) and 30-day mortality (aOR: 2.427, 95% CI: 1.568-3.756, P < 0.001) compared to FluB-p. Multivariate Cox regression models confirmed that influenza A virus infection (hazard ratio: 2.637, 95% CI: 1.134-6.131, P = 0.024) was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality in Flu-p patients. Conclusions: The severity of illness and clinical outcomes of FluA-p patients are more severe than FluB-p. This highlights the importance of identifying the virus strain during the management of severe influenza.",

            "text": "Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that is widespread across the globe. Despite advances in medical technology, influenza causes considerable hospitalizations and mortality [1, 2] . It is estimated that each year, 1 billion cases of symptomatic influenza infection have occurred across the globe, including 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 290 000-650 000 cases of influenzarelated respiratory deaths [3] . From 2010 to 2018, approximately 4.3-23 million medical visits, 140 000-960 000 hospitalizations, 18 000-96 000 influenza-related intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and 12 000-79 000 deaths were associated with influenza per year in the United States of America [4] . The disease burden of influenza in Asia is similar to that of western countries [5, 6] . Influenza infection also poses an economic burden. Recent estimates place the economic burden of a moderately severe to severe pandemic at approximately USD 500 billion, or 0.6% of the global income [7] . For these reasons, influenza epidemics are regarded as the greatest threat to the public health in the twenty-first century.",

Kilbourne suggested that the disease features caused by different influenza virus subtypes are clinically indistinguishable [8] . Several studies have examined the hypothesis that the severity of illness caused by influenza is associated with causal virus types. For example, Mosnier & Irving found that the clinical symptoms and outcomes for patients with influenza A and B infections were comparable [9, 10] . Studies by Kaji and colleagues showed that influenza A infection was more severe than influenza B [11] . The outcomes of different studies have been variable in terms of sample size, study settings, populations, and the ability to control potential confounders. Despite inconsistent findings, to understand the differences of the severity and outcomes between specific influenza virus types is of great significance to arrange rational diagnositic testings, carry out prompt antiviral treatment and make other clinical decisions in the management of severe influenza.",

After adjustment for age, sex, heart disease, malignancies and time from illness onset to antiviral In ferret models, A (H1N1) pdm09 strains led to more severe clinical symptoms and histopathology, followed by A (H3N2) strains, whilst Flu B strains had a milder illness [22] . Although the specific pathogenesis governing these effects has not been elucidated, some mechanisms have been postulated. Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza B virus strains is heavily glycosylated [23] . Since glycosylated HA binds collagenous lectins in lung surfactants, it is easily cleared from the lungs. HA of human influenza B viruses also preferentially bind to \u03b1-2,6linked sialic acids present in the human upper respiratory tract, whilst A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses bind both \u03b1-2,6-linked and \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acids [24] . Influenza B viruses are therefore restricted to the upper respiratory tract, whilst A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses are more prevalent in the lower respiratory tract [25] . Compared to influenza A viruses, influenza B has lower receptor-binding affinity due to the presence of a Phe-95 versus a Tyr-98 in the HA protein, resulting in a loss of hydrogen bonds [26] . The innate IFN response is also more rapidly initiated following influenza B as opposed to influenza A virus infection. This leads to more rapid viral clearance and lower viral titers [27] . In vivo, both influenza A and B viruses downregulate the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). A more pronounced reduction in surface MHC-I expression was observed in influenza B patients, leading to milder immunologic reactions, followed by significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and lung tissue injury [28] .",

Methods were taken to reduce selection bias and control confounders, but some limitations should be noted. First, due to the retrospective nature of the study, potential selection bias may have influenced the data. For example, during each influenza season, patients with influenza-like illness (such as fever, sore throat or cough) were assessed through influenza RNA tests by the subjective judgement of attending physicians in the five hospitals. It was possible that more severe (or milder) patients were tested for influenza. Not all respiratory cases were eligible for swabbing and some selection bias occurred. Secondly, due to the retrospective design, the impact of vaccination on disease severity could not be evaluated, and the inclusion of incomplete data may have lowered the accuracy of our results. Thirdly, there is evidence of different severities of influenza A virus subtypes [11, 32] . However, over 50% of patients were not tested for subtypes in our study. Further work is required to compare the clinical features according to subtype. Finally, our study population were immunocompetent, adolescent and adult hospitalized patients. The conclusions should be assessed prudently prior to similar assessments in immunocompromised patients, pediatrics and outpatients.",
