            "text": "Oxidative stress, which is caused by an imbalance between reactive species and antioxidative stress defense systems in cells, plays a key role in many diseases, including cancers (Reuter et al., 2010), cardiovascular diseases (Anatoliotakis et al., 2013), neurodegenerative diseases (Emerit et al., 2004) et al. The nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2212related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway is the major pathway that responds to reactive species and redox potentials, and Nrf2 activation is a key defense mechanism against oxidative stress (H et al., 2012). However, under physiological conditions, repressor Kelch\u2212like ECH\u2212associated protein 1 (Keap1) holds Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and promotes its ubiquitination (Mcmahon et al., 2003). By contrast, under pathological conditions, Nrf2 is released from Keap1, translocates to the nucleus, and triggers the transcriptional activation of ARE\u2212dependent genes and antioxidative enzymes (Dhakshinamoorthy and Jaiswal, 2001). Thus, targeting the Nrf2\u2013ARE signaling pathway is a logical strategy to discover therapeutic agents for diseases and conditions induced by oxidative stress. The direct inhibition of the Keap1\u2013Nrf2 protein\u2013protein interaction is an alternative for the discovery of small\u2212molecule Nrf2 activators (Magesh et al., 2012). Compounds that interact with Keap1 and occupy the Nrf2 binding site in the protein can cause the dissociation of Keap1 from Nrf2 and finally induce the transcriptional activation of Nrf2 (Pang et al., 2016).",

Many studies have shown that phytochemicals in edible flowers, vegetables, and fruits prevent or mitigate chronic diseases in humans (Kumar et al., 2012; Steinmetz and Potter, 1996). Studies in the last few decades have demonstrated the benefits of phytochemicals counteracting oxidative stress. Phenolic compounds as primary antioxidants can scavenge free radicals, thereby delaying or inhibiting the initiation step and interrupting the propagation step of lipid oxidation (Kiokias et al., 2008). Vitamin E functions as a peroxyl radical\u2212scavenging antioxidant and as an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in vitro and in vivo (Niki, 2014). Carotenoids can act as chemical quenchers undergoing irreversible oxygenation. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials showed that adequate carotenoid supplementation may significantly reduce the risk of several disorders mediated by reactive oxygen species (Fiedor and Burda, 2014). Natural alkaloids are effective under oxidative stress in DPPH, FRAP, and TEAC assays (Rehman and Khan, 2017). Some of these natural compounds exhibit antioxidant effects through activating the Nrf2 pathway; however, details on this finding are few.",
