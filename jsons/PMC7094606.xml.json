This approach represents a limited code status for patients with confirmed or suspected EVD. Code blue refers to paging the code team to come to the patient's bedside and provide emergency medical care; it summons emergency responders throughout the hospital who are not properly donned with PPE and may not have received safety training related to caring for individuals with EVD.2Resuscitation will not be attempted for patients with advanced EVD if resuscitation would be medically futile, put treating clinicians at unreasonably high risk of infection, or both. However, all patients with EVD will receive ongoing support and appropriate medical and comfort care.3Providers caring for or having contact with patients with confirmed or suspected EVD will be properly protected and trained, including training in the proper use of PPE.4The treating team will anticipate, treat, and/or prepare for likely causes of cardiac and respiratory arrest to minimize the need for emergency response. Goals of care will be evaluated on an ongoing basis.5Patients with EVD and their families or proxies will be involved in goals of care discussions throughout hospitalization and will be made aware of limitations of care as they apply. Discussion will include notification of the patient's code status and its rationale. Although neither consent nor assent of the patient, family, or both is ethically required for limited resuscitation status, patients and families are ethically entitled to full disclosure.6Care team discretion will guide general management of patients with EVD. Responding providers will exercise discretion regarding which medical interventions, including resuscitative efforts, can be safely and effectively delivered to patients with EVD. Identified ethics consultants will be available on an ongoing basis to members of the health-care team.\n",

The alternative of a standard DNAR order carries the following disadvantages: (1) DNAR may be misinterpreted to mean that providers have no obligation to assume reasonable risk when caring for patients with EVD. (2) It is easier to justify limited resuscitation for patients with suspected, but not confirmed, EVD than it is to justify DNAR, because limited resuscitation leaves open the possibility of providing certain resuscitative measures. (3) A limited resuscitation status for patients with EVD maintains a patient-centered focus better than a standard DNAR status. A DNAR order may be understood by some providers to preclude what, in some cases, would be helpful interventions.",

Because of the uncertainty surrounding diagnosis and associated risk, the ethical justification for following the proposed policy is weaker in suspected EVD than it is in confirmed EVD. We err on the side of minimizing risk to health professionals during the limited time period in which EVD is reasonably suspected but not confirmed. EVD can be reasonably suspected in situations where individuals present with early symptoms of EVD and have had exposure to the Ebola virus (ie, contact with the blood or bodily fluids of a person with EVD, contact with objects contaminated with the blood or bodily fluids of a person with EVD, or contact with animals infected with EVD).6\n",

Yet, patient advocacy is ethically limited under circumstances where it poses a serious threat to the health or life of others, including health-care professionals.7 Although clinicians should generally put self-regarding interests aside to serve those in need, this obligation is not absolute. The obligation to assist may be overridden when there is an unacceptably high risk to health-care professionals.

In early-stage EVD, the predominant clinical symptoms are GI.8 Early life-threatening situations, such as electrolyte abnormalities, especially sodium and potassium, may result from profuse vomiting and diarrhea, potentially leading to complications, such as cardiac arrhythmia. These complications might be reversible if aggressive life-saving interventions are used. For example, patients with an arrhythmia may benefit from resuscitation measures, such as administration of medication through an existing line or the use of external pacing or a defibrillator. These procedures should be performed by a health-care professional already in the patient's room and properly donned with PPE at time of the event. By contrast, in late-stage EVD, shock and severe metabolic disturbances occur, resulting in multiorgan failure, which is much less likely to respond to resuscitative measures.8\n",

Under these circumstances, resuscitative efforts may be withheld from patients with EVD on grounds of medical futility. The logic of this approach is that the mere fact that a patient is imminently dying does not suffice to show that there is a duty to attempt rescue.20After all, if the patient is actively dying, then any attempt to rescue the patient would fail and should not be instituted. If the likelihood or quality of benefit falls well below a threshold considered minimal, the intervention should not be offered or continued.21 This approach applies to all patients, regardless of diagnosis. For both patients with and patients without EVD, the best available evidence shows that CPR and associated resuscitative measures are ineffective and offer no benefit in the setting of progressive multiorgan failure in a patient already receiving maximal supportive care. Medical futility also justifies withholding other emergent invasive procedures, such as endotracheal intubation or vascular access, in the context of an arrest or other precipitous decline for patients with end-stage EVD. What is unique in the case of patients with EVD is that the medical futility of CPR may arise as a direct result of the delay in responding to the patient's emergency medical needs due to the requirement that all providers be properly donned with PPE. With current donning procedures, the time to prepare providers to respond to patient emergencies renders a standard resuscitation response impractical because of the rapid response required to help an acutely decompensated patient.",

The CDC recommended heightened surveillance for unusual disease occurrence or increased numbers of illnesses following the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, identifying the following biologic agents as being of highest concern: anthrax, plague, smallpox, botulism, tularemia, filoviruses (Ebola virus, Marburg hemorrhagic feverand arenaviruses (Lassa fever, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and related viruses).38 In response to the threat of bioterrorism, the US government continues to take precautions against infectious disease outbreaks, such as smallpox, even though the variola virus that causes smallpox disease was eliminated and no naturally occurring cases have been reported since 1977.39\n",
