Over 2000 infections have been confirmed in 27 countries, and 800 deaths have occurred (WHO, 2019). MERS-CoV is a single positive-stranded RNA virus and belongs to the group C species of beta-coronavirus (Chan et al., 2012). Bats are the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, and camels are its intermediate host (Memish et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). MERS-CoV may spread to humans through camels and may be transmitted from human to human (Health Protection Agency (HPA) and UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation team, 2013).",

The S protein, which is a class I fusion protein, is responsible for viral entry into target cells through receptor binding. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) is known to be its receptor. During viral infection, S protein is processed into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain, and the S2 subunit is required for the membrane fusion of MERS-CoV. Therefore, the S protein is one of the targets for the development of MERS-CoV therapeutics (Du et al., 2017). Some neutralizing antibodies have been developed against the receptor-binding domain of S protein, which blocks the interaction of S protein with DDP4, to inhibit the infection of cells by MERS-CoV (Corti et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2014). In addition, the S protein and its receptor-binding domain are regarded as promising targets for the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV, even though no vaccine against MERS-CoV is yet commercially available (Ma et al., 2014a, b).",

Likewise, VLPs of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-LPs) were produced in insect cells by the coexpression of the S, E and M proteins (Wang et al., 2017). The immunization Rhesus macaques with S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs induced the production of receptor-binding domain-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies, leading to Th1-mediated immunity. This result indicates that S protein-displaying VLPs are a promising tool for vaccination against MERS-CoV.",

To connect the tag sequences, genes encoding the E and M proteins were amplified using the E and M primer sets (Table 1\n), respectively. The genes encoding the E and M proteins had FLAG tag and PA tag sequences at the 3\u2032-end. The gene encoding the S protein was amplified by PCR using Bx-myc-S-F and the S-R primer set (Table 1). The S protein gene had sequences encoding the bombyxin signal peptide and c-Myc tag instead of that encoding its native signal peptide. To express S\u0394TM, which does not have its native transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, the gene encoding S\u0394TM was amplified by PCR using the bx-myc-S-F and S\u0394TM-R primer set (Table 1). The gene encoding S\u0394TM also had the sequence encoding the bombyxin signal peptide and c-Myc tag instead of that encoding its native signal peptide. The gene encoding the E protein was amplified by PCR using the E-F and E-FLAG-R primer set (Table 1). The gene encoding the M protein was amplified by PCR using the M-F and M-PA-R primer set (Table 1). Each amplified gene was inserted into the pFastbac1 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific K. K.). Each resulting recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BmDH10Bac bacmid (Motohashi et al., 2005), and white colonies were selected. A recombinant BmNPV bacmid (BmNPV/S or BmNPV/S\u0394TM) containing each gene was extracted from a white colony, and the insertion of each gene into the BmNPV bacmid was checked by PCR using the M13-F and M13-R primer set (Table 1). Each recombinant BmNPV was prepared by the transfection of each constructed BmNPV bacmid into Bm5 cells. For transfection, several micrograms of recombinant BmNPV bacmid was transfected into Bm5 cells with Jet PEI reagent (Polyplus Transfection, New York, NY, USA). After several days, the culture supernatant was collected, followed by titer-up. To express recombinant proteins in Bm5 cells, Bm5 cells were infected with recombinant BmNPVs at an M.O.I. of 1. The titers of recombinant BmNPVs were determined by the protocol described previously (Kato et al., 2009).",

This result indicates that S\u0394TM was secreted into the hemolymph because of the removal of its C-terminal domains. S\u0394TM was purified from the hemolymph using affinity chromatography. Three main bands were observed in the elution fraction by CBB staining and by western blotting (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that these three bands came from expressed S\u0394TM. The estimated molecular weight of expressed S\u0394TM is approximately 141.9 kDa, and S\u0394TM has 25 putative N-glycosylation sites. However, how many N-glycosylation sites in the S protein are N-glycosylated is unknown. These results suggest that one band over 150 kDa may be intact S\u03bfTM and that two bands below 150 kDa may be processed S\u0394TM. From a larva, 8.3 \u03bcg of S\u0394TM was purified. Small particles were observed in the elution fraction by TEM in Fig. 2C, indicating that S\u0394TM can form such small particles even in the absence of its C-terminal domains. Using Sf-9 cells Coleman et al. (2014) also reported the formation of the particles consisting of the expressed S proteins. The purified S\u0394TM showed specific binding to human DPP4 (Fig. 2D) by ELISA, not to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is a receptor for S protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

The SNVs were broken and shapeless (Fig. 5A and B), while the ENVs were clear and round (Fig. 5C and D). SNVs had a broad peak distribution (Fig. 5E), but ENVs showed a sharp peak at approximately 140 nm (Fig. 5F). This result indicates that ENVs were more uniform than SNVs and that the mechanical extrusion method is favorable for the preparation of nanovesicles displaying the S protein from insect cells. In addition, the coexpression of the M and E proteins with the S protein did not have any influence on the morphology and size of SNVs and ENVs.",

            "text": "In this study, S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs composed of the S, E and M proteins were not generated in Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. The S protein was expressed by the fusion of the bombyxin signal peptide from B. mori instead of its native peptide (Fig. 1). Therefore, we tried to express full-length S protein with its native signal peptide for the preparation of S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs but failed. In mammalian cells, the endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal (ERRS) of the S protein of coronaviruses, which occurs in the cytoplasmic domain at the C-terminus of the protein, is required for the accumulation of S protein in the postmedial Golgi compartment and its return to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), followed by the budding of coronaviruses and VLPs (McBride et al., 2007; Ujike et al., 2016). We also coexpressed the S protein fused with the signal peptide and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of ERGIC-53 from B. mori, which is a non-glycosylated type I membrane protein of 53 kDa resided in ERGIC, instead of its native domains with the E and M proteins in Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. However, S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs were not produced. On the other hands, it was previously reported by Wang et al. that the successful production of S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs composed of the S, E and M proteins in Sf-9 cells (Wang et al., 2017). It is unknown why Bm5 cells and silkworms cannot produce S protein-displaying MERS-CoV-LPs by the coexpression of S, E and M proteins. The localization of S protein in Bm5 cells may clarify why S protein was not displayed on particles composing of M and E proteins.",

These methods allow the easy and efficient production of virus-like nanovesicles and exosome-mimic vesicles from mammalian cells for vaccine development and drug delivery systems. In this study, we successfully produced three recombinant proteins, S, E and M, of MERS-CoV-displaying SNVs and ENVs by surfactant treatment or mechanical extrusion, respectively, which were VLP mimetic nanovesicles. For the application of these VLP mimetic nanovesicles composed of multiple structural proteins of viruses, their properties, including stability, morphology and functionality, should be investigated in detail.",
