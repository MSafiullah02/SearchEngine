These machines must be thoroughly sterilized after each use to prevent the spread of infection. Meanwhile, portable ultrasounds are available for between $2000 and $2500.14 A single handheld probe can be easily sterilized, while complete sterilization of the knobs, buttons, screens, and carts of traditional machines can be difficult and time consuming, if not impossible.

For example, detection of a new consolidation with dynamic air bronchograms may suggest the development of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. In addition to other clinical parameters, such ultrasound findings would support a decision to initiate antibiotics.15 Consolidations that are more posterior may advocate for early prone positioning in the appropriate clinical context. Similarly, increasing B lines suggests a trend toward deterioration in a patient who may benefit from titration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve aeration. Atelectasis on lung ultrasound may suggest the need for additional PEEP and recruitment maneuvers. Although less common in viral pneumonia, the size, location, and appearance of any pleural effusions can be assessed by lung ultrasound to determine the need for drainage.",

In this way, ultrasound can help predict responders and nonresponders to interventions, such as prone positioning and ventilation changes.17,18 Reduction in B lines, the reappearance of A lines, and the resolution of consolidations suggest recovery and would support a decision to wean respiratory support. Although beyond the scope of this article, it is important to note that cardiac ultrasound can also play a major role in optimizing the management of COVID-19 patients who may develop postviral cardiomyopathy19 and who may have weaning failure that is of cardiovascular origin.20",
