We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a \"brief reactive psychosis (298.8)\" under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.",

However, mental health-centered support strategies in such extraordinary settings are often overlooked and poorly coordinated, with controversies on the most effective approach . Addressing the priority of mental health in the general population as well as in healthcare professionals is essential in addition to the infection medical care. Trained staff should identify healthcare professionals at-risk to develop psychiatric symptomatology and timely refer them to specialists for diagnosis and intervention (Pfefferbaum and North, 2020) . Healthcare working teams should be reinforced providing regular contact to discuss decisions and, once the crisis begins to recede, active monitoring, support, and, if necessary, evidence-based treatments should be provided (Greenberg et al., 2020) .",
