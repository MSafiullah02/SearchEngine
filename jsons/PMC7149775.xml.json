Canis familiaris is subdivided into approximately 400 breeds, ranging in size and shape from the teacup chihuahua to the large Irish wolfhound. The domesticated dog is thought to have descended from a Eurasian subspecies of the gray wolf, possibly either the Indian wolf (C. lupus pallipes) or the Chinese wolf (C. lupus chanco). Wolf\u2013dog hybrids have been produced when the species are brought together in captivity (Nowak, 1999).",

A colony of gray collies is maintained at the University of Washington (Seattle) for the study of cyclic hematopoiesis. This condition is manifested by periodic fluctuations of the cellular components of blood, most notably the neutrophil population. These dogs are used to study the basic regulatory mechanisms involved with hematopoiesis, as well as possible treatments for both the human and the canine conditions (Brabb et al., 1995). Golden retrievers affected with muscular dystrophy have been used as models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in human children. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by an absence of the muscle protein dystrophin, inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The dystrophy in golden retrievers is caused by absence of the same protein and is inherited in the same way. The clinical signs (such as debilitating limb contracture) are also similar between the canine and human conditions (Kornegay et al., 1994). Bedlington terriers have been used to study copper storage diseases (such as Wilson's disease), and the development of spontaneous diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism in a variety of dogs has also been studied for comparisons with the human conditions.",

Usually these dogs are either beagles or mongrel foxhounds, although other breeds may be available. Purpose-bred dogs typically receive veterinary care throughout their stay at the breeding facility. They are usually vaccinated against canine distemper virus, parvovirus, adenovirus type 2, parainfluenza virus, Leptospira serovars canicola and icterohemorrhagiae, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Rabies virus vaccination may also be included. Purpose-bred dogs are also usually treated prophylactically for helminths and ectoparasites, intestinal coccidia, and bacterial ear infections (R. Scipioni and J. Ball, personal communication, 1999).",

Random-source dogs that have been treated and vaccinated in preparation for use in research are termed conditioned dogs. These dogs are then suitable for long-term studies or terminal preparations that require unperturbed physiologic parameters. Conditioned dogs are often tested for heartworm antigen because of the implications that infestations can have on cardiovascular status and surgical risk.

Class B licensees purchase the dogs from other individuals (including unadopted animals from municipal pounds) and then resell them to research facilities. There are additional regulations that apply to Class B dealers (such as holding periods and record-keeping documentation) because of the public concern that stolen pets could enter biomedical research facilities in this manner.

The maintenance energy requirement (MER) is the amount of energy used by a moderately active adult animal in a thermoneutral environment, which in the dog is approximately twice the BER (Lewis et al., 1987). For dogs weighing greater than 2 kg, the MER may be calculated using this simplified linear equation: MER (metabolizable kcal/day) = 2(30 weightkg + 70) (National Research Council, 1985; Lewis et al., 1987). The quantity of a correctly balanced diet to be fed to each dog can then be determined by dividing the MER by the energy density of the diet.",

Based on vaginal cytology, the estrous cycle is classified as follows:\nProestrus, early: intermediate and superficial cells, red blood cells, and neutrophils.\nProestrus, late: superficial cells, anuclear squames, and red blood cells.\nEstrus: more than 50% anuclear squames, superficial cells, with or without red blood cells.\nDiestrus: more than 50% intermediate cells, superficial cells and squames early, but becoming completely noncornified with neutrophils present as diestrus proceeds.\nAnestrus: small numbers of parabasal cells and intermediate cells, with or without neutrophils.\n",

Ticks become infected by feeding on an infected dog that is in the first 10\u201315 days of an acute infection (Lewis et al., 1977), and ticks can shed the organisms for up to 5 months.

Cross-reaction may occur between E. canis, E. chaffeensis, and E. ewingii. Titers greater than 1:10 are considered positive and indicative of infection and may persist for up to 1 year. Effective treatment typically produces seronegative results in 6\u20139 months. In some cases, asymptomatic dogs may remain seropositive for years after treatment or may be seropositive with a persistent hematologic abnormality (Bartsch and Greene, 1996). The exact mechanism for this finding has not been elucidated. Ehrlichia canis morulae can be demonstrated in circulating monocytes of Giemsa-stained blood smears. However, this method is labor-intensive and has low sensitivity, as morulae are present transiently and in low numbers. Using buffy coat smears from capillary blood may increase the diagnostic yield.

IFA or ELISA tests for Borrelia antibodies are the assays of choice. It should be remembered, however, that a positive titer in an endemic area indicates exposure and not necessarily disease and that vaccinated dogs will also have a positive titer. Responses to vaccine versus infection may be distinguished by Western blot. Culture or identification of the organism provides a definitive diagnosis but is very difficult to perform. Differential diagnoses include immune-mediated polyarthritis and septic arthritis from other etiologic agents.",

Young dogs who have not received routine immunoprophylaxis (or similarly, mature dogs with a questionable vaccination history) and present with rhinitis, mucopurulent oculonasal discharge, plus or minus hyperkeratosis of the footpads and neurologic signs, are highly likely to have CDV. Ophthalmologic examination may reveal chorioretinitis with acute disease or retinal atrophy in chronic cases. Definitive diagnosis of acute infection can be made by fluorescent antibody testing of intact epithelial cells from conjunctival and mucous membranes. Attenuated strains of CDV, found in modified live vaccines, are not disseminated from lymphoid tissue to epithelial cells and thus are not detected by the fluorescent antibody. Serologic testing is usually not useful, because dogs frequently fail to mount a measurable immunologic response. Because of the variety of clinical signs, there are many differential diagnoses for canine distemper. An important differential diagnosis for respiratory illness is infectious tracheobronchitis (kennel cough). Bacterial, viral, and protozoal causes of gastroenteritis must be considered for cases presenting with vomiting and diarrhea, and rabies, Pseudorabies, bacterial meningitis, and poisonings are differential diagnoses for dogs with central nervous system disorder.",

These changes lead to thrombosis of these vessels and the arterial truncation that can be seen radiographically in severe infestations. The heartworms also release circulating factors that affect vascular tone and can promote bronchoconstriction (Dillon, 2000).

Use of adult heartworm antigen tests has virtually eliminated the historical status of \u201coccult\u201d heartworm disease, which was caused by infestation of adult worms without corresponding microfilarial circulation. Commercial test kits that assay for the presence of adult heartworm antigens, and designed for use by veterinary practitioners, are readily available. False-negative results can occur during the prepatent period after initial infection (first 6\u20137 months), and when the adult worm burden is light or predominantly male. Infections consisting of more than three mature female worms are usually detected by antigenic serology (Knight, 2000). A significant feature of these tests for circulating antigen is that they have a very high specificity (low rate of false-positive results). If a dog were negative on initial testing because of prepatency or small worm burden, it will more than likely be detected on a follow-up test 7 months later.",

Such studies have looked at factors released by adult heartworms, as well as changes in the function of host tissues in response to the worm presence. Probably the most consistent finding is that endothelial cell\u2013dependent relaxation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle is depressed in heartworm-infected dogs as compared with control dogs, indicative of alterations in local endothelial cell behavior (Maksimowich et al., 1997; Matsukura et al., 1997; Mupanomunda et al., 1997). The extension of this effect on peripheral arteries (in vivo and in vitro) has been supported in some studies (Kaiser et al., 1992) but refuted in others (Tithof et al., 1994). It is thought that the endothelium is perturbed by a factor released from the adult Dirofilaria, possibly a cyclooxygenase product such as prostaglandin D2 (Kaiser et al., 1990, Kaiser et al., 1992). These products have also been demonstrated to cause constriction in in vitro rat tracheal ring preparations (Collins et al., 1994), suggesting that bronchoconstriction could be an aspect of the pathogenesis of the infestation. Platelet reactivity was also been found to be enhanced in dogs naturally infected with Dirofilaria, when compared with uninfected controls (Boudreaux and Dillon, 1991). Based on these data, dogs that are positive for adult heartworm antigen should be considered inappropriate for use as research subjects and, if used, should be restricted to nonsurvival preparations that do not require physiological measurements.",

            "text": "Because it affects metabolism in general, hypothyroidism can produce a large number of clinical signs referable to many organ systems. An individual dog with hypothyroidism may have one or any combination of clinical signs. Hypothyroidism reduces the dog's metabolic rate, which then produces such signs as obesity, lethargy, cold intolerance, and constipation. Additionally, hypothyroidism can produce several dermatologic abnormalities, including alopecia, hyperpigmentation, seborrhea, and pyoderma (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera, 1994). Several clinicopathologic abnormalities have also been reported in a large percentage of hypothyroid dogs. These aberrations include increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides due to a decrease in lipolysis and decreased numbers of low-density lipopolysaccharide receptors (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera, 1994). Normocytic normochromic nonregenerative anemia and increased serum alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase have also been reported in a significant number of hypothyroid dogs (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera 1994). Neurologic signs of hypothyroidism, which include lameness, foot dragging, and paresis, may be caused by several mechanisms such as segmental nerve demyelination or nerve entrapment secondary to myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Mental impairment and dullness have also been reported in hypothyroid dogs, secondary to atherosclerosis and cerebral myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Hypothyroidism has been implicated in other neurological abnormalities such as Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, megaesophagus, and laryngeal paralysis; however, these conditions do not always resolve with treatment (Bischel et al., 1988; Panciera, 1994), and so the relationship between hypothyroidism and these problems has not been completely defined (Panciera, 1994). Myopathies associated with hypothyroidism are caused by metabolic dysfunction and atrophy of type II muscle fibers and can present with signs similar to neurological disease (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Hypothyroidism can also cause bradycardia as a result of decreased myocardial conductivity. Abnormalities that may be detected by ECG include a decrease in P and R wave amplitude (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) and inverted T waves (Panciera, 1994). These electrocardiographic abnormalities are caused by lowered activity of ATPases and calcium channel function. Several reports have suggested that hypothyroidism is associated with von Willebrand's disease and bleeding abnormalities. However, the relationship is probably one of shared breed predilection and not a true correlation. It has been demonstrated that dogs with hypothyroidism are not deficient in von Willebrand's factor when compared with other dogs. In addition, the replacement of thyroid hormone in dogs did not increase the levels of vWF:Ag in naturally occurring (Panciera and Johnson, 1994) or experimentally induced (Panciera and Johnson, 1996) hypothyroidism.",

            "text": "Currently, the ability to diagnose hypothyroidism relies heavily on the measurement of serum total T4 (thyroxine) and free T4 (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994). T4 serves primarily as a precursor for T3 in the body and is heavily protein-bound. Free T4 represents the unbound fraction that is available to the tissues (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Using the measurement of serum total T4 and free T4, hypothyroidism can usually be ruled out if the values are within the normal range or higher. If both hormone concentrations are low, it is highly likely that the patient has hypothyroidism, and a therapeutic trial is in order (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). However, it must be noted that nonthyroidal illnesses and some drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, phenylbutazone, salicylates) can falsely lower these values (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994). Therefore, low values do not always indicate that hypothyroidism is present, and animals should not be treated solely on the basis of serum hormone levels if clinical signs are absent. If the clinical signs are equivocal or if only total T4 or free T4 is decreased, further diagnostic testing is warranted (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). Although T3 is the most biologically active form of thyroid hormone in the body, the measurement of serum T3 levels is an unreliable indicator of hypothyroidism (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994). Like T4, serum T3 can be falsely lowered by many nonthyroidal illnesses and many drugs (see above). In addition, T3 may be preferentially released, and conversion of T4 to T3 may be enhanced in the hypothyroid dog (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994). T3 was within normal limits in 15% of the hypothyroid dogs in one study (Panciera, 1994). Autoantibodies can be responsible for false elevations in the concentrations of T3 and T4 found in these respective assays. It has been recommended that free T4, measured by equilibrium dialysis, be assayed in dogs that are suspected of hypothyroidism and have autoantibodies with normal or high T3 and T4. Autoantibodies have been found in less than 1% of the samples submitted to one laboratory (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000).",

            "text": "Other means of diagnosing hypothyroidism have been described. In humans, endogenous TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels provide reliable information on thyroid status, and an assay for endogenous TSH is now available in dogs. However, TSH levels can be normal in some dogs with hypothyroidism, and high TSH levels have been noted in normal dogs. Therefore, it is recommended that TSH levels be considered along with other information (clinical signs, T4) prior to diagnosis and treatment (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000). TSH stimulation testing using exogenous bovine TSH provides a good and reliable method for establishing a diagnosis. Unfortunately, the availability and expense of TSH limit the use of this diagnostic tool (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994). Another drawback of TSH testing is that the test must be postponed for 4 weeks if thyroid supplementation has been given (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989). When TSH is available for testing, there are several recommendations for dosage, routes of administration, and sampling times. One recommendation is 0.045 U of TSH per pound of body weight (up to a maximum of 5 U) to be administered IV. For this protocol, blood samples are taken prior to administration of TSH and 6 hours after. A normal response to the administration of TSH should create an increase of T4 levels at least 2 \u03bcg/dl above the baseline levels or an absolute level that exceeds 3 \u03bcg/dl (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Wheeler et al., 1985).",

            "text": "Obesity is defined as a body weight 20\u201325% over the ideal. In general, obesity occurs when the intake of calories exceeds the expenditure of energy. Excessive caloric intake results from overeating or eating an unbalanced diet. Overeating is a common cause of obesity in pet dogs and may be triggered by boredom, nervousness, or conditioning (MacEwen, 1992). In addition, pet animals are often subjected to unbalanced diets supplemented with high-fat treats. In the laboratory animal setting, overeating is less likely than in a household, because access to food is more restricted and diets are usually a commercially prepared balanced ration. However, obesity can still be a problem if specific guidelines for energy requirements are not followed. In addition, the necessary caging of dogs in the research environment and thus the limitation to exercise reduces energy expenditure and predisposes dogs to weight gain. It is also important to realize that other factors may predispose dogs to obesity, even when guidelines for caloric intake and energy expenditure are followed (Butterwick and Hawthorne,. 1998). As in humans, genetics plays an important role in the development of obesity in dogs. It has been established that certain breeds are more predisposed toward obesity. In a study of dogs visiting veterinary clinics in the United Kingdom, Labrador retrievers were most likely to be obese. Other breeds affected included Cairn terriers, dachshunds, basset hounds, golden retrievers, and cocker spaniels. The beagle was also listed as a breed predisposed to obesity in the household environment (Edney and Smith, 1986).",

There are few objective, quantifiable methods for establishing this diagnosis. Ultrasound has been evaluated for measurement of subcutaneous fat in dogs, and measurements taken from the lumbar area can be used to reliably predict total body fat (Wilkinson and McEwan, 1991). After a diagnosis of obesity has been made, additional diagnostic tests should be performed to determine if there is an underlying cause for the problem. A complete physical exam should be performed to look for signs of concurrent disease and to establish if obesity has adversely affected the individual. Serum thyroid hormones should be evaluated (see Section III,B,1,a), and serum chemistry may reveal an increased alkaline phosphatase associated with hyperadrenocorticism.",

As mentioned above, the restriction of calories is most important, and feeding less of an existing diet can do this. Alternatively, several diet dog foods are available, and there is some evidence that these diets are superior to simple volume restriction (MacEwen, 1992). There has been much concern about the addition of fiber to the diet in both humans and animals as a method for reducing caloric intake while maintaining the volume fed. Studies in dogs have examined the addition of both soluble and insoluble fibers to calorie-restricted diets. These studies have shown that the addition of fiber does not have an effect on satiety in dogs and therefore does not have a beneficial effect in weight loss protocols (Butterwick and Thome, 1994; Butterwick and Thorne, 1997).",

Joint problems including osteoarthritis and hip dysplasia have also been related to obesity (MacEwen, 1992; Kealy et al., 1997).

If the wound is contaminated or dirty, bacterial cultures, both aerobic and anaerobic, should be performed at this time. Then a water-soluble lubricant gel may be applied directly to the wound. A wide margin of hair should then be clipped from around the wound, using a #40 blade. After the clipping, a surgical scrub is performed around the edges of the wound. Povidone-iodine alternating with alcohol or chlorhexidine gluconate scrub alternating with water is most often recommended for surgical preparation of the skin surface (Osuna et al., 1990a,Osuna et al., 1990b). Simple abrasions that involve only a partial thickness of the skin do not generally require further treatment. Full-thickness wounds require further attention, including irrigation with large quantities of a solution delivered under pressure. Two solutions, 0.05% chlorhexidine diacetate in water (Lozier et al., 1992) and 1% povidone-iodine in saline, are most often recommended for wound lavage (Waldron and Trevor, 1993). The chlorhexidine solution may offer the advantage of greater bactericidal activity but does not significantly alter wound healing when compared with povidone-iodine (Sanchez et al., 1988). Actually, the type of solution chosen may not be as important to wound care as the volume and pressure at which the solution is delivered. It has been suggested that 8 psi is required to obtain adequate tissue irrigation, and this may be achieved by using a 35 ml syringe and an 18- or 19-gauge needle (Waldron and Trevor, 1993).",

In addition, other factors such as edema or hypovolemia may reduce bleeding in otherwise viable skin (Waldron and Trevor, 1993). If one is unsure about tissue viability in areas that are devoid of extra skin, the tissue may be left (Swaim, 1980; Waldron and Trevor, 1993), and nonviable areas will demarcate within 2\u20133 days (Waldron and Trevor, 1993). Necrotic fat should be resected liberally, because it does not have a large blood supply and will provide an environment for infection. Often, resection of subcutaneous fat is necessary to remove debris and hair that could not be removed during wound irrigation. Damaged muscle should also be liberally resected (Swaim, 1980).

The principles of basic surgery are discussed in several good texts, and readers are encouraged to pursue additional information. Primary wound closure is defined as closure of the wound at the time of initial wound therapy and is the treatment of choice for clean and clean-contaminated wounds. Closure is performed in two or more layers, carefully apposing tissues and obliterating dead space. If dead space will remain in the wound, a drain should be placed. Subcutaneous closure should be performed with absorbable suture such as polydioxanone (PDS), polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), or polyglycolic acid (Dexon). It is best to use interrupted sutures and avoid leaving excess suture material in the wound. It may be necessary to choose tension-relieving suture patterns, such as horizontal mattress. Skin closure is generally performed with nylon (3-0 or 4-0).",

After debridement and irrigation, the wound should be bandaged. Initially, the wound can be covered by gauze sponges soaked in saline or chlorhexidine to create a wet-to-dry bandage. When the sponges are later pulled from the wound, dried exudates will also be removed. When the wound appears clean, the layer in contact with the wound may be changed to a nonadherent dressing such as vaseline-impregnated gauze (Swaim, 1980). The contact layer is covered by cotton padding, and the entire bandage is covered by a supportive and protective layer. The bandages should be changed once or twice daily, depending upon the amount of discharge coming from the wound. Wound closure within 3\u20135 days of wounding (prior to the formation of granulation tissue) is considered delayed primary closure. When the wound is closed after 5 days, this is considered secondary closure (Waldron and Trevor, 1993). Second-intention healing involves allowing the wound to heal without surgical intervention. This type of healing is often used on limbs when there is an insufficient amount of skin to allow complete closure (Swaim, 1980). It is important to note that second-intention healing will take longer than surgical repair of a wound, and in the case of large wounds it will be more expensive because of the cost of bandaging materials.",

Decubital ulcers usually develop due to continuous pressure from a hard surface contacting a bony prominence such as the elbow, the tuber ischii, tarsus, or carpus. The compression of the soft tissues between the hard surfaces results in vascular occlusion, ischemia, and ultimately tissue death (Swaim and Angarano, 1990). Several factors that increase pressure at the site and/or affect the integrity of the skin will predispose an individual to develop pressure sores. These factors include poor hygiene, self-trauma, low-protein diet, preexisting tissue damage, muscle wasting, inadequate bedding, and ill-fitting casts or bandages (Swaim and Angarano, 1990).",

When wounds involve deeper tissues, including fat, fascia, or bone, more aggressive therapy must be performed.

All of the damaged tissue should be debrided, and wound management guidelines should be followed (see Section III,C,1).

Conservative management of the elbow hygroma is aimed at relieving pressure at the point of the elbow by providing a padded cage surface and/or bandaging the elbow in a manner similar to that used to treat pressure sores (see Section III,C,2). More aggressive therapy, including needle drainage and the injection of corticosteroid into the hygroma, has been described but is not recommended, because infection is a serious complication of this treatment (Johnston, 1975). Likewise, simple surgical excision of elbow hygromas can be associated with complications such as wound dehiscence and ulceration (Johnston, 1975). A technique that has been used successfully involves placement of multiple Penrose drains. The drains are kept in place for 2\u20133 weeks, and the limb remains bandaged for 4 weeks with this technique (Bellah, 1993). Another technique has been described that involves the removal of a crescent-shaped piece of the skin and capsule. The remaining dead space is closed with mattress sutures over stents, and then the wound is closed in a routine fashion. The stents are removed in 5\u20137 days, and the wound is bandaged until suture removal in 10\u201314 days (Newton et al., 1974). Regardless of the method used to treat an elbow hygroma, recurrence of the problem is likely unless the predisposing factors are identified and relieved.",

The catheter should be made of nonthrombogenic material. In addition, it is recommended that catheters be as simple as possible. A catheter with extra ports or multiple lumens requires additional management and supplies more routes for infection. The use of vascular access ports that lie entirely under the skin eliminates many problems with infection. It has also been found that a long extension of tubing connected to the port may actually reduce the potential for infection of the catheter (Ringler and Peter, 1984). The initial placement of an indwelling catheter must be done under aseptic conditions by individuals who are familiar with the procedure. The placement of the catheter should be verified by radiography. Catheters that are used for delivery of drugs or blood sampling should be positioned in the vena cava and not in the right atrium, thereby minimizing trauma to the tricuspid valve. After catheter placement, the animals should be observed daily for signs of either local or systemic infection. The catheter entry site should be disinfected, coated with antibiotic ointment, and rebandaged every other day. Once a month, the catheter line may be disinfected with chlorine dioxide, as described below (see \u201cTreatment\u201d). Throughout the life of the catheter, injections into and withdrawals from the catheter should be done in a sterile manner, and the number of breaks in the line should be kept to a minimum.",

Systemic antibiotic therapy should be initiated for a 10-day period. The choice of drug will ultimately be based on previous experience and culture results. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of blood and locally infected sites should be performed (Ringler and Peter, 1984). Localized abscesses or sinus tracts may be managed by establishing drainage and flushing with chlorhexidine. Again, the catheter should be removed. If retention of a catheter is important, the catheter lumen may be disinfected by filling with chlorine dioxide solution. It has been shown that there are no adverse effects from the use of chlorine dioxide in catheters (Dennis et al., 1989). The solution is removed after 15 min and replaced with heparinized saline. All of the extension lines and fluids used in the catheter should be discarded. The blood cultures should be repeated 3 days after the antibiotic therapy has ceased.

However, extreme inflammation without infection (e.g., pancreatitis, trauma) may create similar signs. One study examined the diagnosis of sepsis in canine patients at a veterinary hospital based on easily obtainable physical and laboratory findings. That study found that septic individuals had higher temperatures, WBC counts, and percentage of bands than non-septic individuals, whereas platelet counts were lower in the septic dogs. There were no differences in respiratory rate or glucose levels between the groups. Using these criteria, the results had a high sensitivity and a tendency to overdiagnose sepsis (Hauptman et al., 1997). Ultimately, the presence of a septic focus simplifies diagnosis greatly; however, the focus may not be obvious. If the signs of sepsis are evident but the focus is not, several systems should be evaluated for infection, including urinary tract, reproductive tract, abdominal cavity, respiratory tract, teeth, and heart valves (Kirby, 1995).",

The inflammation leads to increased vascular permeability with leakage of fluid into the alveolar spaces and can eventually lead to alveolar collapse. If the condition is severe, it may result in adult respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure.

Support of the cardiovascular system should be performed judiciously; fluid overload could lead to an increase in pulmonary edema. The use of colloids is controversial because of the increase in vascular permeability that occurs in the lungs. Oxygen therapy is also controversial, because it may increase lung injury if administered at high concentrations for long periods of time (Nader-Djahal et al., 1997). Several studies have addressed the use of anti-inflammatory agents to reduce lung injury associated with aspiration; however, none are used clinically in human or veterinary medicine at this time.",

Because protein metabolism is a major source of ammonia, all oral food intake should cease until the signs of hepatic encephalopathy have abated. Because gastrointestinal bleeding may occur in individuals with liver failure and this is also a source of protein, the use of H2 blockers such as cimetidine or ranitidine is suggested (Swalec, 1993). In addition, lactulose retention enemas should be performed (10\u201315 ml/lb of a 30% solution in water, retained for 20\u201330 min) (Hardy, 1989). Lactulose is an indigestible semisynthetic sugar that is metabolized in the gut to lactic and other acids. The decrease in colonic pH reduces ammonia levels in the bloodstream by converting intestinal ammonia into less diffusible ammonium ions. Lactulose will also cause an osmotic diarrhea. Antibiotics such as neomycin (10 mg/lb, 3\u20134 times/day) or metronidazole (9 mg/lb, 3 times/day) should also be used to reduce the intestinal load of urease-producing bacteria responsible for splitting urea into ammonia (Hardy, 1989).",

These requirements may be met by slowly increasing protein in the diet as long as signs of hepatic encephalopathy do not recur. To maintain the appropriate balance of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids, the diet should be based on vegetable and dairy protein instead of meat or fish protein (Center, 1998).

The nuclei are regular, the cytoplasm is packed with large granules that stain deeply, and mitotic figures are rare to absent. Grade II (intermediately differentiated) mast cell tumors have indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries with higher nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios, fewer granules, and occasional mitotic figures. Grade III (anaplastic or undifferentiated) mast cell tumors have large, irregular nuclei with multiple prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasmic granules are few, but mitotic figures are much more frequent. In addition to skin lesions, mast cell tumors have been associated with gastric ulcers. These lesions are most likely secondary to tumor production of histamine. Histamine stimulates the H2 receptors of the gastric parietal cells, causing increased acid secretion. Gastric ulcers have been observed in large numbers (>75%) of dogs with mast cell tumors (Howard et al., 1969). The ulcers can be found in the fundus, pylorus, and/or proximal duodenum.",
