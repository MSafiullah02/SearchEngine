CoVs encode an endoribonuclease designated EndoU that facilitates evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, but the target of EndoU activity was not known. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves the 5\u2032-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA, which is the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis. Using a virus containing an EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation, we detected a higher abundance of PUN RNA in the cytoplasm compared to wildtype\u2212infected cells. Furthermore, we found that transfecting PUN RNA into cells stimulates a robust, MDA5-dependent interferon response, and that removal of the polyuridine extension on the RNA dampens the response. Overall, the results of this study reveal the PUN RNA to be a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). We also establish a mechanism for EndoU activity to cleave and limit the accumulation of this PAMP. Since EndoU activity is highly conserved in all CoVs, inhibiting this activity may serve as an approach for therapeutic interventions against existing and emerging CoV infections.",

The positivesense virion RNA is translated to generate the viral replication machinery, which then replicates the positive-sense RNA into negative-sense, genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). The negative-sense RNAs then function as templates for synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA and sgRNA (1, 2). This replication strategy can generate long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates (3), that may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (4, 5). The specific PRR that recognizes CoV RNA is MDA5, which can activate the type I interferon (IFN) response in macrophages (6). Other host dsRNA PRRs, such as PKR and OAS, are also activated and operate to limit CoV replication (7-11). CoVs encode multiple proteins that antagonize these innate immune responses, particularly the activation of the IFN response (9, 12-16), ultimately leading to a dysregulated immune response and increased immunopathogenesis (17, 18). Understanding the mechanisms used by CoVs to delay IFN signaling may provide opportunities for the development of antivirals and live-attenuated vaccines to limit CoV infections.",

            "text": "Here, we investigate the mechanism used by one CoV IFN antagonist, the nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), which is an endoribonuclease designated EndoU. EndoU is highly conserved in all known CoVs (19, 20) . EndoU is similar to the cellular endoribonuclease XendoU, as revealed by bioinformatic analysis of the amino acid sequence (21). X-ray structures of EndoU revealed conserved endoribonuclease folds with catalytic histidine residues required for endoribonuclease activity (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Purified EndoU was shown to cleave single-stranded RNA and dsRNA at uridine residues in in vitro assays (22, 25, (27) (28) (29) (30) . However, the target of EndoU activity during viral infection was unknown. Initial studies revealed that EndoU colocalizes with the viral replication complex (31, 32), and it was suggested that EndoU was necessary for efficient virus RNA replication in cell culture (28, 29) . More recent findings, however, revealed that EndoU catalytic mutant (EndoUmut) viruses replicate as well as wild-type virus in IFN-nonresponsive cells, but are severely impaired for replication in IFN-responsive macrophages (10, 11). These recent results revealed that EndoU activity is important for limiting the sensing of viral RNA by host dsRNA sensors such as MDA5, PKR, and OAS/RNaseL. Limiting viral RNA recognition contributes to delayed type I IFN responses; thus viruses with intact EndoU activity are more virulent than their EndoU-mutant counterparts (10, 11, 20) .",

            "text": "Here, we investigate the mechanism used by one CoV IFN antagonist, the nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), which is an endoribonuclease designated EndoU. EndoU is highly conserved in all known CoVs (19, 20) . EndoU is similar to the cellular endoribonuclease XendoU, as revealed by bioinformatic analysis of the amino acid sequence (21) . X-ray structures of EndoU revealed conserved endoribonuclease folds with catalytic histidine residues required for endoribonuclease activity (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Purified EndoU was shown to cleave single-stranded RNA and dsRNA at uridine residues in in vitro assays (22, 25, (27) (28) (29) (30) . However, the target of EndoU activity during viral infection was unknown. Initial studies revealed that EndoU colocalizes with the viral replication complex (31, 32) , and it was suggested that EndoU was necessary for efficient virus RNA replication in cell culture (28, 29) . More recent findings, however, revealed that EndoU catalytic mutant (EndoUmut) viruses replicate as well as wild-type virus in IFN-nonresponsive cells, but are severely impaired for replication in IFN-responsive macrophages (10, 11) . These recent results revealed that EndoU activity is important for limiting the sensing of viral RNA by host dsRNA sensors such as MDA5, PKR, and OAS/RNaseL. Limiting viral RNA recognition contributes to delayed type I IFN responses; thus viruses with intact EndoU activity are more virulent than their EndoU-mutant counterparts (10, 11, 20) .",

Previous studies showed that the 5\u2032 end of the CoV negative-sense RNA contains polyU extensions (35) , and that EndoU cleaves at uridine residues (22, 25, (27) (28) (29) (30) . Therefore, we considered the PUN RNA as a potential target for EndoU activity. We hypothesized that PUN RNAs accumulate in the absence of EndoU activity. To quantitate the PUN RNAs, we generated cDNA from the negative-sense RNA using a strand-specific primer and performed a series of qPCRs with primers shown in Fig. 4A . Primer set 1 flanks a taqman probe and provides a measurement of total negative-sense RNA. Primer set 2 measures the PUN RNA. By normalizing set 2 to set 1, we can compare relative proportions of the negative-sense RNA that contain polyU sequences. To control for potential \"self-priming\" of the viral RNA during cDNA synthesis, we performed cDNA synthesis in the presence or absence of the negative-sense cDNA primer and quantified RNA expression by qPCR (Fig. 4B ). For both set 1 and set 2 qPCRs, we detected a significantly higher signal with the negative-sense primer compared to no primer. When comparing wildtype\u2212 and EndoUmut-infected cells, we detected a 10-fold increase in PUN RNAs from EndoUmut-infected cells as compared to wild-type virus-infected AML12 cells (Fig. 4C , Left) and detected a 60-fold increase in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Fig. 4D, Left) .",

We detected PCR species of \u223c100 bp from both wild-type\u2212 and EndoUmutinfected cells, and detected a smear of larger PCR species unique to EndoUmut virus-infected cells (Fig. 5B ). To determine whether the length of polyA tails on the positive-sense RNA was affected by EndoU activity, we generated cDNA with oligo-dT primers to select for polyA-containing RNAs and performed the nested PCR reactions. We found that the products generated from positive-sense RNA were similar between wild-type and EndoUmut viruses, consistent with our previous results indicating that the polyA tail is not cleaved by EndoU activity (Fig.  5C ). To determine whether the smear of PCR amplicons represents extended polyU sequences, we sequenced the amplicons with next-generation sequencing and found that EndoUmut PCR amplicons had an increase in the number of reads and proportion of products with extended polyU sequences (Fig.  5D ). The most striking feature of the sequencing results is the bimodal distribution of the polyU extensions present in the EndoUmut-infected cell samples. We found that the majority (65%) of the reads from wild-type virus infection contained 10 uridine residues. In contrast, only 35% of the reads from the EndoUmut virus-infected sample contained 10 uridine residues. This was not due to a difference in the number of reads with 10 uridines but to an increase in longer polyU extensions detected in EndoUmut-infected cells. We detected variability in the polyU extensions in the EndoUmut virus-infected sample, with 65% of the reads containing from 11 to 17 uridine residues. We note that, while PUN RNAs in EndoUmut-infected cells are only a few uridines longer than the PUN RNAs from wild-type virusinfected cells, the PUN RNAs are 10-fold more abundant in EndoUmut virus-infected cells (Fig. 4) . Overall, these experiments revealed that EndoU activity reduces the abundance and length of polyU extensions on PUN RNAs, consistent with our hypothesis that EndoU cleaves the PUN RNAs during virus replication.",

RNA 4 was not cleaved, consistent with the requirement of uridine residues for EndoU recognition and cleavage. To determine whether EndoU cleavage can decrease the ability of PUN RNA to stimulate IFN, we cleaved the PUN RNA with EndoU (Fig.  8D ). In the presence of EndoU and MnCl 2 , the PUN RNA was degraded into smaller RNA fragments. After EndoU treatment, we transfected the PUN RNAs into AML12 cells and measured IFN stimulation (Fig. 8E) . We found that transfecting the RNA treated with EndoU decreased the IFN stimulation activity. We note that the PUN RNA with MnCl 2 migrated faster in the agarose gel, likely due to the addition of the Mn 2+ cation (36), but we do not observe a difference in IFN stimulation in the presence of MnCl 2 alone. Overall, EndoU is capable of cleaving and degrading PUN RNA, which then reduces the ability of PUN RNA to stimulate IFN. ",

EndoU cleaves the polyU sequence on the PUN RNA, limiting the length and abundance of the polyU extension. This reduces the IFN-stimulating effect of PUN RNA, which, without EndoU digestion, activates host sensor MDA5. The fact that EndoU is highly conserved in all CoVs suggests that EndoU activity is important for sustained replication in the host (19, 37) . Our study reveals that the PUN RNA is a PAMP and that EndoU activity is essential for limiting the accumulation of PUN RNA. We developed a model consistent with our findings (Fig. 9 ). We hypothesize that, during the synthesis of negative-sense RNA, the CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase uses the polyA tail as a template to generate negative-sense RNAs with variable lengths of polyU extensions. EndoU can recognize and cleave the polyU extensions, which limits the ability of the negative-sense RNA to form a viral PAMP. In the absence of EndoU activity, the polyU extension on the PUN RNA enhances the interactions of the PUN RNA with a complementary region of the viral genome to form an epitope recognized by MDA5 and the K1 anti-dsRNA antibody.",

Our immunofluorescence studies showed that the epitope recognized by K1 accumulates in EndoUmut-infected cells. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we determined that the RNA bound by K1 was negative-sense RNA. We speculate that CoV negative-sense RNA forms a higher-order RNA structure recognized by the K1 antibody, and that this RNA is also recognized by host sensors. Supporting this idea, a previous study showed that the viral RNA recognized by the K1 antibody during encephalomyocarditis virus infection formed a higher-order RNA structure and could activate MDA5 (39) . Our approach using RNA-seq analysis of immunoprecipitated RNA could be widely used to determine whether other unique dsRNA epitopes are generated during viral infections. Sch\u00f6nborn et al. developed four anti-dsRNA antibodies: J2, J5, K1, and K2 (38) . These antibodies were generated against the L species of dsRNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and each antibody has unique binding specificities to different dsRNA species. For example, the K1 antibody was reported to be highly specific to poly I:C, whereas the J2 antibody is specific to the L species of dsRNA (38, 40) . The differing specificities suggest that each anti-dsRNA antibody recognizes unique dsRNA structures or sequences. Ultimately, structural studies are needed to fully elucidate the higher-order RNA structures that these dsRNA antibodies are recognizing during CoV infection.",

Consistent with these studies, we report that the PUN RNA acts as a PAMP, recognized by MDA5 (Fig. 7) . We show that knocking down MDA5 by CRISPR-Cas9 limits the IFN stimulation by PUN RNA. Canonically, MDA5 binds to long dsRNA species, such as poly I:C, to induce IFN signaling (4). Our study suggests that the negative-sense RNA may form a higher-order RNA structure that can bind and activate MDA5. Interestingly, a longer polyU extension (>12 uridines) on the RNA drives a heightened IFN response. Currently, many studies utilize nucleic acid as an adjuvant to stimulate innate immune responses (41) . With the PUN RNA forming an MDA5-recognized structure, it RNA treated by EndoU cleavage was transfected in AML12 cells, and, at 8 hpt, RNA was purified from cell lysates, and IFN\u03b21 gene expression was measured by qPCR.

Furthermore, the HCV replication complexes may hide the viral RNA from recognition by host sensors (43) . Polioviruses prime replication of the negative-sense RNA with a polyU sequence attached to VPg (44) . The VPg linkage may prevent the exposure of a polyU structure to host sensors, thus preventing the polyU sequence from acting as a PAMP. For influenza viruses, the polyU sequence on negative-sense RNA is essential for polyadenylation, because it is part of a unique stem\u2212 loop structure (45) . However, this RNA structure is localized to the nucleus and not exposed to cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors. These examples illustrate that many viruses have polyU sequences that may act as PAMPs, and that each virus may have evolved unique mechanisms or structures that limit their detection.",

They identified a conserved viral sequence on the positive-sense RNA that could be bound by host proteins, including cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1) (47), a protein that mediates polyadenylation. In addition, CoV nsp8 has been demonstrated to contain 3\u2032 terminal adenylyltransferase (TAT) activity (48) . Nsp8 can synthesize the polyA tail on the positive-sense RNA, and having a complement negative-sense RNA with a polyU extension greater than five uridines enhances the TAT activity. Since we observe EndoU controlling the abundance of longer polyU sequences which stimulate IFN, it would be interesting to determine whether there is an \"ideal length\" of polyU sequences that lack immune stimulation by MDA5, but promote TAT activity during addition of the polyA tail. One caveat of these in vitro studies is that the assays are performed in the absence of other viral replication complex proteins that may alter the binding, recognition, and activity of the RNA processing proteins. Studies have shown protein\u2212protein interactions between nsp12, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp15, which may alter the activities of these proteins (31, 49) . While EndoU can fully degrade PUN RNAs in vitro, the cleavage activity may be more specific during viral infection, due to interactions with other viral proteins in the membrane-associated replicase complex (50, 51) . While EndoU can cleave PUN RNA, there may also be other EndoU cleavage sites during CoV infection that were not detected in this study. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms CoVs use to alter and process viral RNAs.",

Influenza PA-X is an endoribonuclease that selectively degrades host mRNA by hijacking host RNA splicing machinery (52) . PA-X inhibits the translation of host proteins to perturb the cell functions. Pestivirus RNase E(rns) is an endoribonuclease that is secreted outside infected cells and degrades extracellular viral RNAs to block innate immune activation (53) . Lassa virus encodes an exonuclease that will specifically degrade intracellular dsRNA (54) . Both RNase E(rns) and Lassa virus exonuclease cleave viral RNAs thought to be PAMPs. Our study reveals an additional mechanism for a viral endoribonuclease to degrade a viral PAMP. We found that PUN RNAs with variable lengths of polyU sequences are generated in the absence of EndoU activity. We predict that these PUN RNAs can fold back and generate stem\u2212loop structures by hybridizing with an A/G-rich domain located within the PUN RNA or on adjacent RNAs. This stem\u2212loop structure may be recognized as dsRNA by host PRRs, thus stimulating the host innate immune response. The function of EndoU during replication is to reduce the length of polyU sequences, thus limiting the potential for generating PAMPs.",

One vaccine strategy is to generate attenuated viruses that can efficiently be produced and signal for robust, protective, antiviral immune responses. EndoU is not necessary for viral replication, and EndoUmut CoVs are attenuated in vivo while still eliciting a protective immune response (11, 20) . Therefore, EndoU may be one of several immune antagonists targeted for generating an attenuated and recombinationresistant CoV vaccine (58, 59) . Ideally the IFN antagonist mutations would be conserved so they can be applied to any current or emergent CoV, including the 2019-nCoV.

Puromycin-selected cells were then grown and cloned into a monoclonal population. Knockdown of MDA5 was determined by Western blot using rabbit anti-MDA5 (SAB3500356; Sigma) and mouse anti-actin (A00702-40; Genscript).",

Briefly, 1 \u03bcM RNA was mixed with EndoU in Cleavage Buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol) with or without 5 mM MnCl 2 . Reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for indicated time, and reactions were stopped by addition of RNA Gel Loading Buffer (B0363S; NEB) and incubation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. Reaction products were immediately loaded into a 10% polyacrylamide gel with Tris-Borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer or a 1% agarose gel with Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer, and bands were separated by electrophoresis. Gels were then stained with SYBR Green II dye and visualized with a ChemiDoc XRS+ imager (Bio-Rad), and processed with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).",
