            "text": "Viruses infect millions of individuals each year resulting in serious morbidity (Hutchinson, 2018), birth defects (Rasmussen et al., 2016), and mortality (Campos et al., 2015). Viruses have the ability to rapidly evolve and transmit through multiple modes such as the respiratory tract (Mazur et al., 2015; Young et al., 2015), digestive tract (Ferrari et al., 2017) and skin (Hamel et al., 2015). Despite many discoveries related to the understanding of different aspects in virology, viruses are still a major cause of disease (Suratanee et al., 2010). In recent years, life-threatening viruses such as COVID-19 (Corman et al., 2020; Lorusso et al., 2020), Zika virus (ZIKV) (He et al., 2017; Petersen et al., 2016) and Ebola virus (EBOV) (Baize et al., 2014; Gire et al., 2014) have unexpectedly emerged and were difficult to tackle since there were no approved vaccines or effective treatments for the treatment of these viruses. In general, viruses cause significant economic burden to society and most are recognized as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Gostin et al., 2014; Gulland, 2016; Patel and Jernigan, 2020).",

These methods, especially for nucleic acid detection methods, require expensive equipment and well-trained operators (Eivazzadeh-Keihan et al., 2019; Yeh et al., 2020). Moreover, these methods are unable to meet the needs of clinical diagnosis as well as provide timely details necessary for large viral outbreaks. Point of care (POC) enables simple, fast, autonomous and sensitive virus detection (Gervais et al., 2011; Gubala et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2019; Yetisen et al., 2013). The POC device is currently available in the market (Chin et al., 2012), which is expected to reach USD 52.6 BN by 2025 and will experience a robust compound annual growth rate of 9.75% from 2019 to 2026. In response to viral outbreaks, advanced POC diagnostic technology must be equipped for both the home and clinical use.",

This advanced technology has both integrated and miniaturized characteristics, which can integrate a traditional laboratory into a small chip. It uses a small amount of detection reagents and samples to obtain accurate test results in a short period of time, which is especially suitable for POC. Recently, dramatic paper-based microfluidics (Ahn et al., 2018; Reboud et al., 2019), centrifugal chips (Lee et al., 2006; Li et al., 2019a), wearable microfluidic devices (Gao et al., 2017; Koh et al., 2016; Nyein et al., 2018), digital nucleic acid detection chips (Song et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2014) and others have been proposed for pathogen detection (Tsougeni et al., 2019) as well as disease screenings (Shuler, 2019) and additional applications (Yin et al., 2019). These microfluidic technologies have been systematically classified and summarized by lots of reviews (Bruijns et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2019; Reinholt and Baeumner, 2014) to promote technological innovation of microfluidic systems.",

In addition, in response to virus detection, it is also necessary to have a full understanding of the virus including its subtypes, genotypes and other notable characteristics. In this review, we summarize viruses that have been of concern over recent years (Fig. 2\n) and discuss the application and performance of microfluidics for their detection. Moreover, we summarize the current shortcomings of microfluidics in viral detection and pave ideas for future development. We aim to promote technological innovations of microfluidic chips so they exert maximal effects for future virus outbreaks.",

It is known as the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and has a high mortality (Broadhurst et al., 2016). EBOV causes damage to blood vessels, the liver, spleen, kidney and immune system (Malvy et al., 2019). EVD symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, vomiting, and diarrhea can occur within 2\u201321 days after a person is infected with EBOV (Martines et al., 2015; Richards et al., 2018). The EVD is mainly prominent in West Africa, where the major 2014 outbreak infected a total of 28,646 people and led to the death of 11,323 individuals (Kinsman et al., 2017). This outbreak was the largest EVD epidemic since the discovery of EBOV in 1976 (Wang et al., 2016). During the outbreak, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), the gold standard method, was used to detect the virus (Broadhurst et al., 2016), but was found to be time-consuming as well as expensive (Kaushik et al., 2016; Pinsky et al., 2015).",

Four (EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, TAFV) of the five subtypes are extremely severe and detrimental to humans (Khan et al., 2015). It is necessary to study microfluidic system capabilities for the detection of various EBOV types. Magro et al. also developed a multiplex paper chip to detect three types of EBOV based on RPA (Magro et al., 2017) (Fig. 3 B). Piraino et al., (2016) developed a microfluidic chip that combined digital and analog technologies. This chip contains a high dynamic range and can simultaneously detect three types of EBOV with a LOD of 1pM from 5 \u03bcL of serum. Brangel et al. (Brangel et al., 2018) reported a paper and smartphone-based platform to detect IgG antibodies against the virus in sera. Detection results testing 90 survivors and 31 uninfected individuals revealed 100% sensitivity (Fig. 3 C). Moreover, this platform was able to detect three types of EBOV. More recently, Lin et al.

More than 37 million people live with HIV and infect about 2 million more every year (Anampa et al., 2020). This has been occurring since the first case of HIV infection in the early 1980s (Bao and Shao, 2018). Early HIV diagnosis can reduce transmission through behavioral preventive measures and aid in the treatment of infected individuals through treatment strategies such as anti-retroviral therapies (ART) (Choi et al., 2014). However, only 10%\u201351% of infected individuals are aware they are infected, most of who live in resource-limited areas where they are not able to readily be tested (WHO, 2010).

The virulence of the influenza virus is reflected in the immunogen of its enveloped protein (Kaiser, 2006). Infected individuals suffer from severe viral pneumonia and acute lung injury (Guo and Thomas, 2017). The WHO estimates that influenza viruses infect approximately 5\u201315% of the world population and cause 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths each year (Vemula et al., 2016). There are four types of influenza viruses including influenzas A, B, C and D. Among these, influenza virus A infects humans and other animals such as pigs and birds. Influenza viruses B and C only infects humans. Influenza virus A can be presented in 144 various subtypes based on combinations of 18 hemagglutinin (HA,H1\u2013H18) and neuraminidase (NA,N1\u2013N11) (Petrova and Russell, 2018; Tewawong et al., 2017). To prevent the spread of influenza and reduce economic and health burdens, accurate and rapid detection methods for the virus are necessary.",

In 2016, Lee's group developed an integrated microfluidic method based on the sandwich-based aptamer that could detect H1N1 at a LOD of 0.032 hemagglutination units (HAU) within 30 min (Tseng et al., 2016). In 2020, their group (Lu et al., 2020) also proposed a more automated digital microfluidic platform to detect H1N1 (Fig. 5\nA). This method utilizes electromagnetically-driven magnetic beads and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA)-like assays on the platform to detect H1N1 viruses. This system can also reach a LOD of 0.032 HAU within 40 min. Ma et al., (2019) proposed a simple self-driven microfluidic chip to detect H1N1 (Fig. 5 B). This system integrated nucleic acid extraction and RT-LAMP and was able to detect 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 HAU units/reaction in 40 min through colorimetric detection.

More recently, Han et al., (2016) reported a microfluidic electrochemical system to multiplex detect the influenza A virus. This group established the electrochemical immunosensor through three electrodes arrangements and ZnO nanorods (NRs) on the inner surface of PDMS. This system can simultaneously detect the H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in the 1 pg/ml - 10 ng/ml range. Wang et al., (2020) developed a microfluidic system based on magnetism mediated separation and size mediated signal detection to multiplex detect influenza A (Fig. 5 C). The LOD of this system reaches 3.4 ng/mL for H7N9 HA and 4.5 ng/mL for H9N2 HA. The disc chip proposed by Liu et al., (2018) can detect three avian influenza viruses and two influenza viruses on a single chip within 70 min. Shen et al., (2019) also proposed an integrated microfluidic system that contains sample preparation and a RT-PCR module (Fig. 5 D). This system uses glycan-coated magnetic beads to capture all influenza viruses in samples and can simultaneously detect twelve influenza subtypes with LODs ranging from 40 to 3000 copies within 100 min. Wu et al., (2019) developed a digital microarray system to multiplex detect H9N2, H1N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses. This system uses antibodies to modify the microarray fluorescent magnetic nanospheres to achieve multiplex detection with a LOD of 0.02 pg/mL. The commercial product Cobas\u00ae has been used for the detection of influenza. This instrument uses qRT-PCR detection, which can detect and distinguish between influenza A and influenza B viruses within 20 min using RNA detection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens.",

The WHO has announced that ZIKV is a PHEIC (Xu et al., 2016). ZIKV can be transmitted through human contact and has been detected in urine, blood, semen, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva and even tears (Paixao et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018). ZIKV infection is generally asymptomatic. A small number of people will have mild clinical symptoms such as mild fever, fatigue, headache, joint pain and a rash, which will rarely lead to serious illness or complications. In recent years, it has been found that the virus can cause teratogenicity and Guillain-Barre syndrome (Cugola et al., 2016; van den Berg et al., 2014). The high contagious rate of the virus led to over 2 million humans being infected globally (Santiago et al., 2018). The most recent outbreak (Petersen et al., 2016) highlights that early diagnosis of ZIKV is extremely important to control epidemic situations, which is extremely challenging (Janahi et al., 2017; Ricotta et al., 2019).",

            "text": "In recent years, microfluidics has also shown to be an effective tool for the early diagnosis of ZIKV. Microfluidic chips based on nucleic acid detection have important applications in ZIKV detection (Pardee et al., 2016). For example, Song et al., (2016) reported a cassette microfluidic system based on RT-LAMP (Fig. 6\nA). This chip is chemically heated to eliminate the need for electricity. Moreover, it uses a visualization method to observe the virus. These characteristics make this system extremely suitable for POC. This system also achieved detection of 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 40 min. Ganguli et al., (2017) generated a microfluidic chip based on a RT-LAMP and smartphone combination. This chip has the ability to multiplex detect ZIKV and other viruses for precise results. The LOD of this system is 1.56e5 PFU/mL in blood under 35 min. Kaarj et al., (2018) developed a paper microfluidic chip combined with RT-LAMP and a smartphone to detect ZIKV RNA. This system is sensitive and can detect 1 copy/\u03bcL in 15 min with high specificity. However, this system requires additional purification steps. Yang et al., (2019) proposed a wearable microfluidic system to detect the Zika virus (Fig. 6 B). This system integrates RPA on a bandage-like sensor. Body heat can activate the sensor since the RPA can react at room temperature. It has also been demonstrated that the wearable biosensor reaches a detection limit of 10 copies/\u03bcL within 10 min. This method has proven to be very convenient, low-cost and easy-to-receive. If equipped with a sample preparation function in the future, it will have very broad application value. More recently, Batule et al. (Batule et al., 2020) reported a two-step paper chip strategy used for RNA extraction and RT-LAMP. This method can detect 10 copies in the serum within 1 h.",

However, to date, ZIKV infection is still difficult to diagnose because of its cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (Wu et al., 2018).

SARS-CoV-2 is believed to infect host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger transmission capacity compared to SARS and has a similar pathogenicity compared to MERS-COV(Zheng et al., 2020). COVID-19 symptoms include a dry cough, fatigue and fever that is followed by anorexia, myalgia and dyspnea. In addition, COVID-19 can also cause damage to the myocardium, resulting in chronic cardiovascular issues (Li et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). The WHO has declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a PHEIC on January 31, 2020. This virus has infected millions of people worldwide in just a few months. Nucleic acid detection has been used to detect the virus during this outbreak. The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) announced nucleic acid testing as the gold standard for virus detection. Antibody testing is used as a supplementary test for suspected cases where nucleic acid detection was negative and is not used as a basis for initial diagnosis or exclusion of new coronavirus infection.",

However, due to the rapid development of the epidemic, qRT-PCR can no longer meet the demands associated with needed testing. POC instruments that based on the microfluidic technology play important roles in diagnosing the virus during this epidemic. For example, The ID NOW\u00ae instrument proposed by Abbott\u2122 in USA can detect positive samples in 5 min and negative results in 13 min. This product has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The detection principle is based on the RPA technology and the instrument only weighs 3 kg, which is very suitable for POC. Filmarray\u00ae, a product of BioFire\u2122, uses microfluidic technology that integrates nucleic acid extraction, purification and PCR amplification into a single chip and results in sequential and accurate detection. This instrument has been previously used for the detection of EBOV. Currently, the COVID-19 test kit has been approved by the FDA for EUA based on this system and can be used for rapid detection. The test is specifically designed and ran on existing Filmarray\u00ae 2.0 and Filmarray\u00ae Torch platforms. GeneXpert\u00ae developed by Cepheid\u2122 can integrate sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and detection into a small detection kit, where even those without professional skills can perform complex molecular detection analyses. This system has been used for the detection of HIV. In response to COVID-19, Xpert SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection reagent has obtained EVA from FDA for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RTisochip\u00ae proposed by CapitalBio\u2122 in China can detect 6 common respiratory viruses including COVID-19 in a single chip within 1.5 h. This system not only detects SARS-CoV-2, but also effectively identifies patients with influenza and COVID-19. The POC instrument developed by Cannon\u2122 in Japan can detect the SARS-CoV-2 in 35 min. The instrument only weighs 2.4 kg and DNA can be amplified in as little as 10 min using respiratory samples.",

HBV infection can cause cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (Estevez et al., 2017; Lavanchy, 2004; Sarrazin, 2016).Investigators also use microfluidics to perform convenient and accurate diagnoses for these viruses (Chang et al., 2015; Vaghi et al., 2016). Li et al. (Li et al., 2019b) described a disc chip to detect HBV in whole blood. This disc chip integrated sample preparation and qRT-PCR. Detection reagents were prestored into the chip and the freeze-dried reagents were kept in 2\u20138 \u00b0C for 6 months in the disc chip. Moreover, the separation step of plasma or serum is avoided since it is directly detected from whole blood. This system can detect 102 copies/mL HBV DNA in \u223c48 min from 500 \u03bcL of whole blood. Our group also proposed a digital isothermal chip for the quantitative detection of HBV. This chip has 120576 reaction chambers and the dynamic range of the detection template is up to 6 orders of magnitude. The maximum detectable template amount is 1.13 \u00d7 106 copy numbers in 36 \u03bcL (Wu et al., 2017). Hepatitis C (HCV) is the major cause of chronic liver disease and is often associated with the development of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure and death (Pawlotsky, 2016; Petruzziello et al.). Mu et al., (2014) developed a paper chip to detect HCV(Fig. 8\nA).

In recent years, virus sample preparation has also attracted more attention and there have been different proposals for viral sample preparation strategies. For different detection methods, sample preparation have different meanings such as sample enrichment (Surawathanawises et al., 2016) or nucleic acid extraction (Chen et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Recently, Du et al. (Du et al., 2017a) proposed an automated sample preparation microfluidic system that utilized air bubbles and magnetic beads to achieve efficient capture of the Ebola virus. Vaghi et al., (2016) reported a PDMS chip for HCV RNA purification and detection from plasma. Capture efficiency was improved with two orders of magnitude and LOD was improved 10-fold using this system. Kim et al., (2019) proposed a microfluidic system to concentrate viral particles. In this system, the poly (ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) membrane was integrated into the chip and the virus was concentrated through autonomous and continuous perfusion. Yeh et al. (Yeh et al., 2020)developed a microfluidic chip for rapid virus capture and in situ detection. This chip uses carbon nanotube arrays with differential filtration porosity to concentrate the virus and uses surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to detect the virus.

However, many studies have ignored the fact that there are virus subtypes and only target one or more subtypes, which affects accuracy in practical applications. For example, some viruses such as influenza virus have nearly 200 subtypes, which poses a great challenge for microfluidic chip. To achieve multiple detection in chips, multiple colors or different division areas are used (Gu et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016). However, these methods generally need expensive instrument and reagents, which limit the application of the chip. Therefore, multiple detection capabilities are challenges in the clinical application of microfluidic chip.",

Digital quantitative methods such as digital PCR and digital LAMP can achieve absolute quantification and do not depend on the standard curve to obtain high sensitivity (Sreejith et al., 2018). Recently, studies have shown the accuracy of digital quantitative methods and this emerged technology has been widely used in clinical diagnoses (Salipante and Jerome, 2019; Tian et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2019). However, due to limitations related to instruments, costs and sample preparation, it is difficult to apply this quantitative method in POCT.
