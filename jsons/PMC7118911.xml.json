The same situation applies to coliforms (Enterobacteriaceae), which probably account for no more than 1% to 2% of CAP cases, but are relatively easy to recover from expectorated sputum on MacConkey agar; negative cultures usually exclude their presence. Haemophilus influenzae is the second most common bacterial pathogen, but it is also a common contaminant and almost always is treated with empiric regimens other than amoxicillin.

            "text": "The future of diagnostic testing is somewhat optimistic because of the events of the past 3 years, which have emphasized the need for better diagnostics in pulmonary infections. The anthrax epidemic of 2001 brought reality to the concern for bioterrorism and carried new demands for better detection methods, including diagnostic studies of patients with enigmatic pulmonary infections. The SARS epidemic of 2003 was associated with about 916 deaths, a small fraction of the annual mortality attributed to influenza and S pneumoniae, but it was devastating to global economies and brought about incredible demands for infection control, including hospital closures, quarantines, the introduction of respiratory etiquette for disease control and extensive temperature monitoring. This made detection one of the highest priorities. The threat of avian influenza has refocused the need for detection of this specific agent because of the potential for a major global epidemic and the high-mortality rate (60%) among the 55 reported cases in Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Thailand [12]. These agents are on the must-know list and are rare, but their combined effects have refocused attention on the relatively poor status of detection methods forthe etiologic agent of CAP. The emphasis is pathogen specific, but these experiences are likely to help launch microbiology into the 21st century with respect to use of modern molecular techniques to detect agents of pneumonia.",

            "text": "Sputum purulence is an important factor in the accuracy of sputum bacteriology. Early investigators emphasized the importance of specimen collection by the physician and fleck picking by the microbiologist. These points were formalized in the analysis of cellular constituents of the sputum sample by microscopic analysis in the oft-quoted report by Murray and Washington in 1975 [29]. The report emphasized cellular analysis as a criterion for discarding specimens containing more than 10 squamous epithelial cells/low power field (LPF; 100 times the magnification on the gram-stain smear). This conclusion was based on the observation that cultures of such specimens yielded an average of more than four bacterial species, and potential pathogens were found in less than 15% [29]. Two years later, however, one of their colleagues from the Mayo Clinic, Robert Van Scoy, expressed his frustration as a clinician who had discarded most of the specimens from his patients with pneumonia [30]. He pleaded for acceptance of any specimen that showed more than 25 PMN cells/LPF, regardless of the number of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) based on reanalysis of the original data. There has been widespread acceptance of this concept for screening specimens but also substantial variation in the criteria used (\nTable 1) [1], [29], [30], [31], [32]. One of the best studies to determine appropriate screening criteria was by Geckler et al [1], who compared results of various criteria from expectorated sputa with results from a transtracheal aspiration. This study showed the best agreement with the criterion of less than 25 SECs/LPF. There was agreement between sputa samples and TTA results in 79% of specimens with less than 25 SECs, compared with 27% in specimens showing more than 25 SECs (a total of 96 specimens were examined). In a subsequent report [33], gram stains of sputum and transtracheal aspirate (TTA) specimens from 100 patients with acute pneumonia were interpreted by laboratory staff and house staff. A predicted pathogen grew in the TTA culture in 36% to 62% of cases based on sputum gram stain and in 37% to 62% of cases based on gram stain of the TTA. These results demonstrate good correlation between gram-stain results with expectorated sputum and TTA, but there was also enormous variation in the interpretations of the same gram stains from either source.",

Two caveats regarding the use of these criteria are that cytologic screening is not appropriate for studies of Legionella spp [34] or acid-fast bacilli, and specimens obtained using hypertonic saline (induced sputum) generally provide inadequate specimens because of high concentrations of SECs [35].",

            "text": "Routine cultures of expectorated sputum have received mixed reviews that are analogous in some ways to review of gram stain. Some studies have shown that these specimens have good correlations with more reliable specimens, such as blood cultures or transtracheal aspirates [36], [37], and some studies have shown that they are of little or no value [38], [39], [40], [41]. Limitations imposed by the reality of clinical practice are that up to 40% of patients with pneumonia fail to produce adequate specimens for any diagnostic studies, and many patients have received antecedent treatment with antimicrobial agents that precludes meaningful culture, especially for recovery of fragile common pathogens such as S pneumoniae and H influenzae. Another major problem concerns the adequate implementation of quality assurance, especially at a time when resources for microbiology studies are limited and many or most hospitals outsource this service. Issues that are important components of quality control include the following:\u2022Cultures should be performed rapidly after collection if they are retained at room temperature, although this requirement is disputed by some investigators. The standard in microbiology laboratories is to plate within 2 hours or to retain the sputum at 4\u00b0C if the length of the delay is 2 to 24 hours [42]. This practice prevents overgrowth of contaminants or minority species.\u2022Cytologic screening should be done as a contingency for acceptability for culture, although the specific criteria are variable (see earlier discussion).\u2022Standard laboratory media for respiratory secretions are 5% sheep blood agar, MacConkey agar, and chocolate agar. The chocolate agar generally is incubated in 5% carbon dioxide to facilitate recovery of H influenzae. Legionella spp and Bordetella pertussis require specialized media.\u2022Potential pathogens that should be identified and reported include S pneumoniae, S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, H influenzae, Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria meningitidis. The only reportable yeast is Cryptococcus neoformans.\u2022The concentration of bacteria is an important but often neglected aspect of interpretation. This facet of analysis is formalized with quantitative cultures of bronchoscopy specimens and can be applied conceptually to expectorated sputum culture. Most true pathogens are recovered in moderate or heavy growth, meaning that recovery occurs in the third or fourth streak using a standard plating procedure.\u2022There should be correlation with the gram-stain results. Some laboratory protocols are gram-stain directed, meaning that the extent of microbiology studies is determined by the gram-stain results [42], [43], [44]. Sampling errors with fleck picking can introduce errors [45].\n",

            "text": "Transtracheal aspiration originally was described by Pecora and Yegian in 1959 as a method to obtain specimens from the lower airways that are free of contamination from the upper airways [47]. The procedure is performed using a 14-gauge needle with an intermediate-sized Intracath, which is inserted through the cricoid membrane. The catheter is passed to its full extent, the needle is withdrawn, and aspiration is performed with a 20- to 30-mL syringe. Saline may be instilled to facilitate specimen collection, but this step is infrequently necessary and should be avoided when possible, because dilution of the specimen makes semiquantitative culture results less meaningful. Only a few drops of secretions are necessary for microbiology studies. This procedure was used extensively by several investigators during the 1970s [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], but it fell into disfavor in the 1980s as a result of patient nonacceptance, concern for complications, and arguments that it was unnecessary for optimal care given the adequacy of empiric antibiotic treatment for most patients. The major complications were bleeding at the site of needle insertion; coughing paroxysms that could compromise air exchange when the catheter was placed in the lower airways; and the profound irritation of the foreign body in the trachea, which was the most unacceptable facet of the procedure for patients [48], [55]. Serious complications were rare if the operator was skilled and the patient had no contraindications. Numerous reports of results with this technique were uniformly favorable in terms of the diagnostic results, provided that the specimen was obtained before antibiotic treatment. Use of the technique in healthy medical students established the microbiologic principle that justified this approach, showing that the tracheobronchial tree is normally sterile below the larynx in healthy persons [49]. Studies of patients were uniformly favorable in terms of diagnostic yield. The largest published report included 383 patients who had satisfied criteria for probable bacterial pneumonia based on fever, pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph, and clinical response to antibiotic treatment [50]. Of these 383 patients, 335 had a likely pulmonary pathogen recovered in the transtracheal aspiration (TTA); of the 48 patients with false-negative cultures, 44 had received previous antibiotic treatment. The major cause of false-positive cultures is presumably the presence of chronic lung disease with colonization of the lower airways [54]. The technique was useful in studies of pulmonary infections involving anaerobic bacteria, because meaningful cultures for anaerobes require uncontaminated specimens [55]. Even patients with chronic lung disease do not have anaerobes in the lower airways (with the occasional exception of patients with bronchiectasis) [55].",

For detecting conventional bacteria, this technique is no better than expectorated sputum because of the inevitable contamination of the inner channel during passage to the airways. Alternative methods that now are used extensively and have better results employ quantitative cultures of BAL specimens or specimens collected with the double lumen brush catheter. This technique first was described by Wimberly et al [56] in 1979, and it has become a popular, though controversial, method to study patients with nosocomial pneumonia in ICUs, particularly in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. It occasionally is used for patients with CAP who have enigmatic pneumonia, but the requirement for technical expertise, the need to collect specimens before institution of antibiotic therapy, and the effectiveness of empiric antibiotics that is given rapidly generally preclude practical use for patients with acute pulmonary infections [57]. Among patients with CAP, bronchoscopy most commonly is used for patients with more chronic and enigmatic pulmonary infections in which empiric antibiotics are difficult to select and rapid institution of treatment is not mandated by the clinical presentation. The use of quantitative cultures is based on the principle that pulmonary infections by bacteria almost always are associated with bacteria in concentrations exceeding 106/mL. The concentration that is considered significant with the brush catheter is usually 103/mL and with BAL is usually 104/mL; these concentrations reflect the dilutional effect of the procedure and the processing [55].",

The procedure initially was introduced in 1882 [58]. It can be done with CT guidance to permit sampling of small lesions. It usually is performed with an 18- to 22-gauge, thin-walled spinal needle. There is an extensive reported experience with this technique for detection of conventional bacteria from 20 to 50 years ago, but the technique rarely is performed, except in patients with usual lesions at the present time. The most extensive experience from the earlier period was reported by Bullowa [2], who examined lung aspirates in 1467 patients with suspected pneumococcal pneumonia. Positive results were obtained in 510 patients (diagnostic yield, 35%). Among 211 patients with bacteremic pneumonia, the yield of S pneumoniae was 165 (78%). The presumed explanation for these false-negative results was improper placement of the needle or nonviable organisms (136 patients). A review of 23 published reports on this technique from 1922 through 1994 showed that the yield of microbial pathogens ranged from 37% to 94%, and the rate of false-positive results was virtually nil [55].",

In the pre-penicillin era, S pneumoniae accounted for more than 80% of all pneumonias and 96% of lobar pneumonias [1], [2]. There has been a continuing reduction in the yield of the pneumococcus, so studies in the past decade generally show that these organisms account for only 10% to 20% of cases [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. This decline often is regarded as an artifact of microbiology, reflecting the diminished quality and interest in laboratory diagnosis that result in the nondetection of a bacterial pathogen in most cases. A meta-analysis of 122 reports in the English-language literature on CAP for 1966 through 1995 showed that approximately 6000 of 33,000 patients (18%) had a defined bacterial pathogen. S pneumoniae accounted for 73% of all cases in this category and 66% of cases with a lethal outcome [46]. S pneumoniae accounted for approximately 65% of all patients with bacteremic CAP [46] and had a much higher frequency in cases in which more aggressive diagnostic methods, such as transtracheal aspiration, were used [47]. The British Thoracic Society Pneumonia Research Committee reviewed 148 cases with CAP and no identifiable pathogen and concluded that most of these cases probably were caused by S pneumoniae\n[59].",

            "text": "An established diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia requires recovery of this organism from an uncontaminated specimen source, such as blood, pleural fluid, transtracheal aspirate, or transthoracic needle aspirate. As noted, this organism accounts for about 65% of bacteremic CAP cases, and these cases account for 5% to 12% of hospitalized patients with CAP [46]. Because most patients do not have empyema, have bacteremia, or undergo invasive diagnostic testing, this diagnosis is pursued only with gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum. As noted, gram stain is subject to substantial subjective variation depending on the quality of the specimen and expertise of the observer. Culture is problematic and produces false-positive and false-negative results; false-positive results occur as a result of the 5% to 10% of adult patients who are colonized with S pneumoniae in the pharynx, and false-negatives results occur because of the imperfection of sputum bacteriology and multiple studies showing a diagnostic yield of 50% or less in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia [41]. Specialized techniques to improve this yield of false-negative results include stains of expectorated sputum with specialized methods to detect pneumococcal polysaccharide, including the Quellung test, latex agglutination, and counterimmunoelectrophoresis in urine or respiratory secretions. A potentially important development is the commercial availability of a urinary antigen test using a rapid immunochromatographic assay. One prospective, controlled trial showed positive results in 88 of 107 adults with pneumococcal bacteremia and 3 of 106 (3%) adults with septicemia caused by other microbes [60]. This study, which showed a 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity, is at least as good as gram stain or culture, and it has the advantages of rapid results, diagnostic usefulness after antibiotic treatment, and specimen availability in patients who have no expectorated sputum. The disadvantages are that the sensitivity is less in children who have higher courage rates for S pneumoniae, the sensitivity may be less in adults with nonbacteremic pneumonia, and there is no pathogen for sensitivity testing.",

            "text": "The estimated frequency with which C pneumoniae is responsible for hospitalized cases of CAP ranges from 10% to 20% [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. When this organism is found, there are often questions regarding relevance because of inadequacies in testing and the frequency of copathogens that seem to dictate the course [61]. Detection methods include culture for C pneumoniae, PCR, and serology. Culture requires the use of cell cultures and is not generally available, except in research laboratories. PCR techniques may be used, but the reagents are not cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are poorly standardized [62]. The most frequently used assay is the microimmunofluorescene (MIF) assay for detection of IgM or a fourfold increase in IgG titer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed these diagnostic methods and concluded that only 4 of 16 PCR assays are adequate and that all are \u201chome grown\u201d (meaning that they are not commercially available). With regard to the MIF assay, the diagnostic criteria were an IgM titer exceeding 1:16 or a fourfold increase in the IgG titer [62]. Most reports of the cause of CAP have not obliged these criteria, so reliable incidence data are not available Studies have shown poor interobserver consistency in the interpretation of the MIF assay [63]. Interpretation by two experts of specimens from 392 patients showed poor correlation (\u03ba-value for dichotomous titers, 0.53 [<1:16 versus \u226516]). The conclusions are that the gold-standard method is culture, which is not routinely available; the laboratory standard is the MIF assay, which is poorly standardized; and the most promising test is PCR.",

Some authorities consider PCR to be promising [42], [65], but there is substantial variation in specimen collection, sample preparation, amplification procedures, and reagents. No reagents for PCR detection have been approved by the FDA. In one report of 27 patients with atypical pathogens, including 19 patients with M pneumoniae infection, the atypical pathogens occurred more frequently in patients with typical pneumonia than in those with atypical pneumonia (as determined by clinical features) [64].

            "text": "\nLegionella spp are implicated in 2% to 6% of CAP cases; may cause epidemics, including nosocomial epidemics; and result in a substantial mortality rate even when treated with the appropriate antibiotics. Laboratory methods for detection include culture, serology, direct immunofluorescent antibody staining, the urinary antigen assay, and PCR. The relative merits of these tests are outlined in\nTable 2\n[66]. A confounding issue in noncultural assays is that there are more than 40 Legionella spp and a total of 64 serogroups [67]. L pneumophila causes about 90% of cases, and serogroups 1, 4, and 6 account for most within species. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [5], [68] recommend two tests: (1) culture, which detects all of the species but is technically demanding (ie, large numbers of false-negative results by many or most laboratories); and (2) the urinary antigen assay, which is easy to perform and provides rapid results. The main limitation of the urinary antigen assay is that it detects only L pneumophila (serogroup 1), but this organism accounts for about 80% of sporadic cases of Legionnaires' disease. The diagnostic usefulness of the assay is summarized in the report by Helbig et al [69]. Among 472 patients with culture-proven Legionella spp infections, the urinary antigen assay had a sensitivity exceeding 80% in patients with community-acquired or hotel-associated Legionnaires' disease, but only 45% in patients with nosocomial disease (\nTable 3). The inference is that L pneumophila may occur less frequently in hospital-acquired cases, which has important implications for test secretions. The FDA has approved a PCR method that detects L pneumophilia, including all serotypes, using respiratory tract secretions.",

The major mechanisms to establish this diagnosis requires specimens that are devoid of upper airway flora, such as transtracheal aspirates, pleural fluid, transthoracic needle aspirates, or uncontaminated specimens from metastatic sites [70], [71]. Most studies of anaerobic pulmonary infections were done with TTA from 1970 to 1980; this procedure is no longer common, and anaerobic lung infections are almost never proved unless an empyema is present. There is a limited experience with bronchoscopy specimens using BAL [56], [57] or the protected brush catheter [4]; the total experience is sparse and is limited to laboratories with the specialized skills necessary to successfully culture anaerobes. Anaerobic infections of the lung now rarely are confirmed by bacteriologic studies in the absence of empyema. Clinical suspicion of these infections is often helpful, however. Putrid sputum or empyema fluid is considered diagnostic of anaerobic infection, aspiration pneumonia with typical predisposing conditions usually is caused by anaerobes, and necrosis of tissue with lung abscess or a bronchoplural fistula strongly suggests this cause [71].",

Most of the experience with inhalation anthrax comes from the 2001 epidemic attributed to bioterrorism, in which 11 patients developed this disease. Before this event, no cases of inhalation anthrax had occurred in the United States since 1976 [73], [74]. The diagnosis of inhalation anthrax is made on the basis of clinical and laboratory observations, including several clinical clues that distinguish this disease from common forms of CAP [74]. Some laboratory tests are particularly suggestive: a wide mediastinum on chest radiograph, hyperdense mediastinal nodes on chest CT scan, and bloody pleural effusions. The best method to confirm the diagnosis is with blood cultures, which were positive in all eight patients who had specimens collected before antibiotic therapy; these cultures were positive within 18 hours [72]. With tularemia, the putative agent may be cultured from blood, sputum, or pharyngeal exudates, but only with difficulty and with the use of specialized media containing cysteine or other sulfa-hydroxyl compounds, such as thioglycolate broth or charcoal-yeast agar [75]. This organism can be a hazard to laboratory personnel and should be cultured only in a biologic safety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. Diagnostic methods include PCR, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), immunoblot, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. These tests are generally available only in research or public health laboratories. Y testis is cultured from sputum or blood [76]. On gram stain, it typically appears as a safety-pin\u2013shaped, bipolar-staining, gram-negative coccobacillus. When this diagnosis is suspected, the specimen should be divided for incubation at 28\u00b0C (for rapid growth) and at 37\u00b0C (for identification of the capsular antigen).",

For hospitalized patients, a pre-treatment blood culture and an expectorated sputum gram stain and culture should be done. Testing for Legionella spp is appropriate in hospitalized patients, especially those who are seriously ill. New tests that merit use in selected patients are the urinary antigen assay for S pneumoniae and the PCR test for L pneumophila. Anticipated developments in the near future are PCR tests for detection of C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae.\n",
