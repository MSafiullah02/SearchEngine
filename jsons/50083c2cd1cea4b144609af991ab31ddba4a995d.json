Linnaeus The Swedish naturalist, Carolus Linnaeus, is credited with introducing the earliest organized classification of living things in his Systema Naturae or natural system. He divided living things into plants and ani mals. Based on morphology and motility, the dis tinction between the two groups of organisms was clear: plants were green and did not move; on the other hand, animals were not green, but moved. Soon after the discovery of the microscope, previ ously invisible microscopic organisms were observed, some of which had properties common to both plants and animals. Some such as Euglena were green like, but they also moved about like animals. Because the clearcut criteria which separated plants from animals were absent in these \"new\" organisms, the German biologist who was a contemporary of Charles Darwin, in 1866 coined the name Protista for a third kingdom, in addition to the Plant and Animal Kingdoms. 3. Robert Harding Whittaker (1920 -1980 Whittaker was an American. Born in Wichita, Kansas, he worked in various places including the University of California, Irvine, and Cornell University. In 1968, he proposed the fivekingdom taxonomic classifica tion of living things into the Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista (Algae and Protozoa), and Monera (Bacteria). His categorization of living things was based on three criteria: celltype (whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic); organizational level (unicellular or multicellular); nutritional type (autotrophy or heterotrophy). 4. Carl R. Woese (1928-) The current classification of living things is based on the work of Carl Robert Woese of the University of Illinois. While earlier classifications were based mainly on morphological characteristics and cell type, following our greater understanding of living things at the molecular level, Woese's classification is based on the sequence of the gene of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 16S of the small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, or the 18S of the small subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome (Petti et al. 2006) . The sequence of the rRNA in the 16S or 18S of the small subunit of the ribosome is used for the following reasons: (a) The ribosome is an important organelle in all living things where it is used for a basic function for the support of life, namely, protein synthesis. From parent to offspring (vertical gene transfer), or by horizontal or lateral gene transfer, in which genes jump between unrelated organisms, a common phenomenon in prokaryotes. There is little or no lateral gene transfer in the sequences in the 16S or 18 S RNA of the ribosomal small units. All the above properties make the sequence of the rRNA in the 16S or 18S of the small subunit of the ribosome useful as molecular chronometers for mea suring evolutionary changes among organisms. Using this method, living things are now divided into three domains: Archae, Bacteria, and Eukarya. A diagram matic representation of the three domains is given in Fig. 4 .1, and their distinguishing properties are given in Table 4 .1 (Woese 1987 (Woese , 2000 (Woese , 2002 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1050, "end": 1093, "text": "Kingdoms. 3.

(a) G + C ratio The G + C ratio is the percentage of guanine + cyto sine in an organism's DNA. Several methods exist for determining this ratio. One method is to deter mine the Tm or temperature of melting of the DNA. At room temperature, DNA is double stranded. However, as its temperature is raised gradually, the two strands separate and the rapidity of separa tion with increasing temperature depends on the amount of G and C in the organism's DNA.

These include CO 2 , alcohols, methyl substrates, methanol (CH 3 OH), methylamine (CH 3 NH 3+ ), and trimethylamine ((CH 3 ) 3 NH + ) and acetic compounds such as acetate (CH 3 COO \u2212 ) and pyruvate. 3.

They containing four species in two genera, they are unusual in their ability to toler ate acid conditions. The two Picrophilus species are the most acidophilic organisms known.

Thermoplasma spp. are also very unusual in that they do not have a cell wall. T. volcanium has been isolated from a number of solfatoras around the world. The cell membrane of Thermoplasma is composed of a lipopolysaccha ridelike compound consisting of lipid with man nose and glucose units and called a lipoglycan. Examples of this group are Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma. These Archae lack cellwalls and in this regard are like Mycoplasmas. They not only survive without cellwalls but they also survive high temperatures and low acid conditions. For these conditions, these organisms have special polysaccaride structures in their cell membranes, a lipopolyssacharide. 4. Hyperthermophilic Archae: Well-known members of this group are Thermococcus, Pyrococcus, and Methanopyrus. Members of this group have optimal temperatures of 80\u00b0C and many grow at tempera tures higher than that of boiling water. Thus Thermococcus and Pyrococcus (cocci with a tuft of flagella on one side) grow at between 70\u00b0c and 106\u00b0C with an optimum at 100\u00b0C (Pyrococcus).
