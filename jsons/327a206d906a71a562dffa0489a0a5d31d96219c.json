Dengue virus, HCV, and rhinovirus all remodel the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate sites for their replication using mechanisms that rely on host lipid biosynthesis. The dengue virus NSP3 protein specifically recruits fatty acid synthase to viral replication sites, which is critical for dengue replication [31, 36] .

Despite arising from diverse tissue types, cancerous cells display relatively similar metabolic programs that include activation of glycolysis, induction of nucleotide biosynthesis, and activation of fatty acid biosynthesis [87] [88] [89] . Many viruses, including HBV [90] , HPV [91] [92] [93] , HCV [11, 15, 94] , and KSHV [6, 95, 96] play direct causal roles in human tumorigenesis induce these various metabolic activities. The contributions that these metabolic changes make towards oncogenesis, regardless of any infectious etiology, have become a major focus in cancer biology research (reviewed in [97] ). To some extent, the shared metabolic phenotypes associated with oncogenesis and viral infection likely reflect common proliferative goals between cancer cells and viruses, i.e., creation of large amounts of energy and biomass for the production of progeny. However, common metabolic phenotypes between infected cells and cancer-derived cell lines also present challenges. The study of viral infection occurs predominately in the context of cancer-derived cell lines. Given their metabolic similarities, it is perhaps unsurprising that transformed cell lines produce higher viral titers relative to nontransformed tissue. However, in studying viral replication in these cells, viral metabolic phenotypes become difficult to discern from the underlying metabolic contributions associated with oncogenesis. Further, important contributions of specific viral factors responsible for driving viral metabolic reprogramming would likely be missed when studied in a cancer-cell background which already exhibits these metabolic changes. In more physiologically relevant systems, the contributions made by these factors would be evident, and could be studied with an eye towards therapeutic intervention.

In doing so, viruses usurp the host's small molecule resources to provide energy and molecular building blocks to support infection. Viruses also target small molecule metabolism to organize viral maturation compartments and to modulate immune responses. The host, however, is not a passive bystander with respect to viral metabolic manipulation. Rather, the host responds at various levels, including innate mechanisms to limit viral metabolic modulation in individually infected cells as well as metabolic immunosurveillance by the immune system. As such, control of the small molecule network continues to emerge as a core host-pathogen interaction that can determine the outcome of viral infection, making it a worthwhile goal to target viral-host metabolic regulation as a means to limit viral infection. Achieving this goal will be aided by a number of factors. First, continued elucidation of small molecule metabolic activities that are important for viral infection, as well as the mechanisms through which they contribute to infection, will broaden the number of candidate therapeutic targets. Further, successful therapeutic development requires a sufficiently wide therapeutic window to limit viral replication without inducing toxicity. Targeting virally-encoded metabolic activities has been a successful clinical strategy, e.g., various nucleotide analogs. However, viral enzymes can quickly evolve resistance to these targeted therapeutics, which necessitates cocktail-type therapies increasing concerns about toxicity. Targeting host-cell metabolic activities would largely limit the ability for viruses to evolutionarily acquire resistance, but targeting host enzymes also raises concerns about potential toxicity. With these concerns in mind, virallyinduced host lipid metabolic activities appear particularly attractive as candidates for therapeutic targeting, as a number of inhibitors of this type are already FDA approved and widely prescribed, such as the cholesterol-lowering statins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we are at the very initial stages of understanding the mechanisms of virushost metabolic interplay and how they contribute to infectious outcomes.
