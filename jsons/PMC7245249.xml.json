To control this disease, effective treatments, including SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, are being actively pursued [1]. One potentially efficient approach is the repurposing of drugs previously approved to treat other diseases, since they are immediately available for use in clinical trials with COVID-19 patients and have known safety profiles.",

Animal CoVs cause persistent enzootic infections that inevitably infect new host species and become zoonotic, as happened for SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Due to the diversity and relentlessness of these viruses, their individual mitigation is difficult [4]; and therefore broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are needed, especially for those prone to be periodically cycling in and out of humans and livestock. Therefore, the small molecule inhibitors, either old drugs or new chemical entities, were actively pursued and developed aiming to prevent or cure the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. Previous work established the clinical efficacy of pegylated interferon-\u03b1-2a, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of the MERS-CoV [15, 16]. Therefore, the strategy of repurposing existing drugs to treat patients infected with novel or zoonotic CoV has been validated and merits consideration in the contest of tackling the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 pandemic.",

The serotype \u2161 FIPV Taiwan isolate NTU156 strain, a kind gift from National Taiwan University, was propagated and titrated in Fcwf-4 cells [26]. Confluent Fcwf-4 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with various concentrations of testing compounds of up to 100 \u03bcM at 37\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 48 h. Sixteen h post inoculation, cells were infected with FIPV NTU156 strain at 300 TCID50 per well and incubated at 37oC. After 1 h, the supernatant was discarded and a series of 7 concentrations at different dilution of testing compounds in DMEM containing 2% FBS added. Plates were incubated at 37oC under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for additional 48 h; then, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the virus was assumed to correlate with the intensity of the crystal violet staining and measured visually for determination of the 50% effective concentrations (EC50). Cell cytotoxicity was also measured by crystal violet staining. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) was calculated according a Reed and Muench method [27].",

HCoV-OC43 (ATCC\u00aeVR1558\u2122) was grown and propagated in HCT-8 ells cultured with DMEM and 2% FBS. EC50 was measured using an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). HCT-8 cells were deposited in 96-well plates, pre-treated with solutions of the compounds to be tested for 30 minutes, and then infected with HCoV-OC43 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05, and incubated at 37oC (see above) for 72 h. For the IFA assay, HCT-8 cells were fixed with 80% acetone and subjected to IFA with (i) an antibody against nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-OC43 (Mab9013; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and (ii) antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (#55499; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA). After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with the FITC-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and the fluorescence intensities measured using either a SpectraMax\u00ae Paradigm\u00ae system (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) (excitation and emission wavelengths, 485 and 535 nm, respectively) to determine the EC50 for inhibiting nucleocapsid protein expression; or viewed by a fluorescence microscopy. Hoechst 33258 dye (H3569, Invitrogen\u2122, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to stain the nuclear DNA of live cells. Images of the cells after IFA or Hoechst 33258 staining were captured using a charge-coupled device linked to a Nikon Image-Pro Express. The cells were treated with a series of 5 concentrations of the test compounds at 5-fold dilution; and the results of these assays used to obtain concentration-response curves from which EC50 values were determined. The % area of immunofluorescent staining of the cells was used to correct for EC50 values since the fluorescence intensity was disproportionately higher when only small portion of the cells were infected. For the cytotoxicity assay, HCT-8 cells cultured in DMEM and 10% FBS in 96-well plates were treated with a designed series of 5 concentrations at 5-fold dilution of the test compounds for 72 h. The results of these assays were used to obtain the concentration-response curves from which the CC50 concentrations were obtained.",
