This suggests that most macaque protein-coding genes have been reliably identified by sequence homology-based approaches, whereas non-coding RNAs are less likely to be identified by such approaches due to their weaker sequence conservation [14] . The biological relevance of ncRNAs is rapidly emerging in many research areas, including in HIV/AIDS research. For example, our recent RNAseq studies have found the expression of many ncRNAs is related to virus infection, including mice infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [15] and human CD4 + T cells infected by HIV-1 [16] . Zhang et al. [17] reported that the knockdown of the long ncRNA NEAT1 enhances HIV-1 production by increasing the export of Rev-dependent instability element-containing HIV-1 mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here we also showed that many newly identified intergenic transcripts were differentially expressed during SIV infection of rhesus macaques or during Ebola virus infection of cynomolgus macaques. Not only do these results convincingly argue that many of novel transcripts identified in this study are biologically relevant but also that this collection of novel transcripts can serve as a resource for future macaque studies due to its more complete coverage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 137, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 380, "end": 384, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 693, "end": 697, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 740, "end": 744, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 760, "end": 764, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "By de novo assembly of un-mapped RNAseq reads, we also identified many macaque transcripts which are missing from existing macaque genome assembles. Our analyses both locate the specific genomic regions which need to be revised and provide the exact sequences for filling those gaps or correcting the errors. We found that the majority of these missing macaque transcripts only partially cover homologous human genes, based on their placement on the macaque-human genome alignments. This suggests that the current rhesus macaque genome assembly has already covered most macaque genes, but likely with relatively small 'holes' for many genes, mainly due to its draft quality. As currently most sequenced genomes are of draft quality, there is a great need for systematic and continuous improvements of these genome assemblies. Here we demonstrated that many of these 'missing' fragments could be readily identified by de novo assembly of un-mapped RNAseq reads. Because species-specific RNAseq data are becoming more readily available, new computational strategies are needed to harness this sequence information to improve reference genome assemblies in parallel to individual studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, we used ultra-deep transcriptome sequencing data to systematically derive more complete genome annotations for the two macaque species most commonly used in research applications.
