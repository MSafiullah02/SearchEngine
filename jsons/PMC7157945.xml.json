Among the drugs currently tested in vitro and in vivo, remdesivir, ribavirin, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown promising clinical results in inhibiting the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al. 2020). However, while the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic actions and clinical benefits remain to still be explored, the search for information regarding CQ and HCQ toxicity is a priority, since it can directly contribute to the design of randomized clinical trials (Cabral et al. 2019; Jorge et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2020; Stokkermans and Trichonas 2019; Yam and Kwok 2006; Zhang et al. 2015).",

In addition, there is a growing trend of preference for HCQ, which is a less toxic derivative of CQ, and was found to yield better results in inhibiting proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 (Liu et al. 2020).",

More specifically, the retinal pigmented cells react to the accumulation of external segments of the photoreceptors triggered by CQ and HCQ resulting in a decrease in phagocytic activity of lysosomes on the external segments of the photoreceptor, migrating to central and peripheral regions of the tissue and inducing epithelial atrophy with irreversible changes in its photoreceptors (Yam and Kwok 2006).",
