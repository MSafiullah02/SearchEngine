The overall number of deaths is 228 [6] (Table 1) . This value includes cases for which the regional health authorities have confirmed the finding of infection by new viruses A/H1N1. The Italian Government has faced the spread of new flu by providing a vaccine strategy and by promoting the Regions and Autonomous Provinces to identify the reference centers for patients suffering from acute respiratory failure.

An ECMO machine, in addition to remove CO 2 and add O 2 to blood, regulates the blood temperature with a heat exchanger, removes air bubbles via drip chambers and checks incoming and return pressures. Moreover, the system is equipped with safety devices and monitors: Air bubble detectors can identify microscopic air bubbles in the arterialized blood; Arterial line filters between the heat exchanger and the arterial cannula are used to trap air and trombi; Pressure monitors, which are placed, measure the pressure of the circulating blood and are used to monitor for a dangerous rise in circuit pressure.",

            "text": "Novalung technology: The Novalung Interventional Lung Assist (iLA) device is a membrane ventilator that allows for oxygen and carbon dioxide gas exchange to occur by simple diffusion. It has been used in patients with severe acute lung failure due to ARDS, inhalation injury, severe pneumonia, chest injury, foreign body aspiration, and after thoracic surgical interventions [12] . Novalung system is a pump-less IFMBE Proceedings Vol. 29 extracorporeal system to remove carbon dioxide (iLA -Novalung\u00ae GmbH, Germany) during the secondary transfer for higher level of care of patients with severe hypoxemichypercarbic respiratory failure (ARDS, ALI, other interstitial disease but also in patients who require immediate and emergent management of CO 2 levels (severe respiratory insufficiency, intracranial hypertension). This device is attached to the systemic circulation and receives only part of the cardiac output (1-2 L/min) for extracorporeal gas exchange The iLA consists of a plastic gas exchange module with diffusion membranes made from polymethylpentene (PMP). Gas transfer takes place without the direct contact with blood and the PMP membrane surface in contact with blood is treated with a heparin coating to provide non-thrombogenic surface. Blood flows over the exterior surface of the device's fibers so the ventilating gas (commonly O2) flows inside these fibers. In this way the Novalung iLA mimics the native lung. This allows for the blood exiting the device to have the normal amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide that exits the normal lung [13] .",

All the machines have been bought by the Clinical Engineering Department and installed into the selected hospital of the region. This Department, using the Hospital-based Health Technology Assessment methodology, has performed an evaluation of commercially available alternative technologies (Maquet, Decapsmart and Novalung). The evaluation found that Decapsmart and Novalung systems are more similar respectively to a dialysis system and to a kind of artificial lung while the best results in terms of effectiveness of removal of CO 2 are provided by the ECMO technique achieved by Maquet technology. Thanks to ECMO technology, in Pavia, in patients with A/H1N1 flu, the survival was 100% in 7 patients. During the pandemic peak, the A/H1N1 flu sufferers have occupied from 20% to 30% beds in ICU of San Matteo Polyclinic Hospital.",
