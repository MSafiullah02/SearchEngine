While every occurrence deserves a proper epidemiological investigation, several constraints such as limited resources, political considerations, and an assumed familiarity with the pathogen may hinder the process [1], [2]. This may result in what are known as \u201chidden outbreaks\u201d in which spread is known to transpire in a localized environment (such as an endemic pathogen) but inquiries are not considered to be worthwhile in the larger context of global human health. This practice may be considered sound, however there is the potential an outbreak may expand to become an epidemic such that both caseload and costs are significantly increased [3], [4].",

Genetic analysis revealed the isolate was a new species which was named C. auris. The species was closely associated with C. ruelliae and C. haemulonii, the latter of which had been known to cause fungemia [32]. C. auris was later isolated in other South Korean patients with otitis media [33]. The discovery was concerning yet assessing the significance in terms of risk for an epidemic was difficult at best. Two years later, the first cases of C. auris fungemia in South Korea [34] were detected, including one from an isolate taken 15 years earlier in 1996. The findings suggested the species already could possibly be endemic in the country. Moreover, an increased tolerance to fluconazole was identified suggesting future cases could be more difficult to control. Over the next three years, antimicrobial resistant strains of C. auris healthcare-acquired infections were observed in Kuwait [35] India [36], and South Africa [37]. In 2017, the yeast was discovered in the United Kingdom [38], South America [39], Europe [36] and Canada [40]. Genetic rDNA analysis of 24 isolates in the UK demonstrated several geographic origins [38] highlighting the importance of human travel in the spread of the species.",

While there is increasing attention in the healthcare field to the risk of this pathogen [41], the international surveillance program SENTRY has demonstrated the contribution of C. auris to the overall burden of Candida species remains small and limited to healthcare facilities. However, the nearly simultaneous emergence of the species across several continents suggests the yeast is ubiquitous in the environment and may pose a threat to an increasingly immunocompromised population [42]. Additionally, the increase in antimicrobial resistance seen in numerous isolates confers significant hurdles to combat fungemia [43]. Guidelines to deal with C. auris are either in place [44] or in development [45] but as seen in the case of C. difficile, this may only have a limited effect in controlling its spread in the community and through travel. Public surveillance is necessary to determine the as of yet unknown prevalence of the yeast in the community and potential routes of transmission should also be examined to determine whether preventative strategies such as hygiene measures in the community may help to reduce the burden.",

Moreover, the ability of the fungus to infect animals, such as dogs, cats, bats, rodents, and armadillos [48], potentiates even greater spread via domesticated and possibly feral reservoirs.

Other diseases were eventually associated with this virus including adult T-cell leukemia, HTLV-1 associated myelopathy, tropical spastic paraparesis, uveitis, dermatitis, psychological disorders, and general immunosuppression [61]. Though the virus was detected worldwide, until recently, it was considered sporadic. That view has changed due to epidemics in several regions including Brazil, Spain, Sub-Saharan West Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Japan, and Australia [62]. Due to the bloodborne nature of the virus, which can only be transmitted efficiently through unprotected sexual contact [63], [64], [65], the virus typically remains endemic to a region without significant geographic spread. However, historical analyses of HTLV-1 reveal the virus can be introduced into another area through large scale population movements from endemic regions [66], [67]. For example, Trevino et al. [68] examined HTLV in Spain and discovered HTLV-1 has entered the country as a result of migration. While the virus has yet to become endemic in the Spanish population, the authors suggest this will occur in time.",

The virulent strain is known to cause painful skin lesions known as Buruli ulcers, named after the Ugandan region where this infection was first described [70]. The bacterium and associated disease has subsequently been found in several other areas of Africa including Angola [71], Benin [72], the Democratic Republic of the Congo [71], C\u00f4te D'Ivoire [73], Ghana [74], Nigeria [75], and Togo [76]. The infection also has been identified in Australia [77], and most recently Jordan [78]. While the association between the bacterium and the symptoms are well established, the mode of transmission has yet to be elucidated. The infection is self-limiting and several reports suggest the highest risk is associated with living in a riverine region [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]. As to the potential route for inoculation, several theories have been suggested such as bites from water bugs [84], [85] and the potential for colonization with the bacterium through contact with soil [86] and watersheds [87], [88].",

In a genetic analysis of the spread of the pathogenic branch in Africa, Vandelannoote et al. [89] suggested the bacterium spread at the same time as populations were divided by European colonial rule. Infected individuals contaminated pristine water sources allowing for the growth and dissemination of the species. In this regard, the potential for spread of the bacterium relies on migration of those who are infected. While the morbidity associated with this disease should prevent such movements by those infected, political and socioeconomic strife may lead to forced travel during infection. Surveillance for ulcers should be conducted in healthcare facilities to identify new cases in non-endemic regions. In the event a case is discovered, efforts to minimize the potential spread to watersheds need to be in place to prevent the development of endemicity.",

In addition, promotion of vaccination will help to reduce the likelihood of infection in travelers. While human to human transmission has not been demonstrated for this virus, the virus may be brought into a region where competent mosquitoes thrive allowing for the initiation of the sylvatic and/or urban transmission cycles.",

Developing these decision-based policies require the use of advanced methods to improve confidence in results. The use of advanced molecular analysis techniques such as whole genome sequencing may provide a wider perspective on the nature of the outbreak and whether it truly is isolated or is a part of a larger problem. Molecular and syndromic surveillance in at-risk areas can provide real time assessments and provide predictive information. The latter may be aided through the use of social media, which is currently being examined for its power in identifying and predicting outbreaks [109], [110], [111], [112]. Mathematical modeling of anthropogenic effects apart from travel and trade, such as climate change, urbanization, and food supply and demand can enhance the fidelity and accuracy of these calculations. Finally, the appreciation of social and cultural practices can offer valuable insight into how healthcare workers and the community may react in the event of pathogen detection. This information also can offer best practices for collaborative efforts to reduce the chances for amplification and spread to wider areas.",

However, this situation quickly can change and lead to an expansion into a larger public space. While we may be able to vaguely predict how such escapes may occur, they are only guesses with little contributory value to policy and health systems development. For this to occur, appropriate algorithms need to be put in place and used to assess each outbreak as it happens. This may require valuable resources and could be met with resistance from numerous levels of government and the public in general. However, in light of the economic burden already seen with what amount to preventable epidemics, the cost may be fully justified.",
