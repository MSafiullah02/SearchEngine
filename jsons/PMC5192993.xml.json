As a result, vaccine design initiatives aim at targeting the pre\u2010fusion state of viral fusion proteins, which correspond to the conformation that could be detected by the immune system before infection. The intrinsic metastability of viral fusion proteins is usually associated with challenges to preserve the pre\u2010fusion state during purification. This is illustrated by the case of the respiratory syncytial virus (paramyxovirus) F protein which required co\u2010expression of the ectodomain (fused to a T4 foldon motif) with a pre\u2010fusion specific Fab to enable isolation of this conformation.27, 28, 29\n",

After cleavage, the S1 and S2 subunits remain non\u2010covalently associated in the metastable pre\u2010fusion S trimer. In the case of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, S2 processing has also been suggested to promote subsequent cleavage at a second site located just upstream of the fusion peptide (S2\u2032 cleavage site) to allow the fusion reaction to proceed upon virion uptake by a target cell.4, 5 We engineered a construct featuring a single amino acid substitution in the S2 cleavage site to prevent furin processing and enhance the stability of the MHV S ectodomain pre\u2010fusion structure. Substitution of an arginine residue present at position 717 by a serine residue at the site of cleavage (from RAHR\u2193 to RAHS) resulted in the purification of a homogeneous uncleaved protein product as confirmed by SDS\u2010PAGE analysis [Fig. 2(B)].",

To promote oligomerization, an engineered trimerization motif based on the transcription factor GCN431, 32 was C\u2010terminally fused to the MHV S ectodomain in frame with the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) motif helix [Fig. 2(A)]. Biophysical analyses using analytical size exclusion chromatography coupled online to multi\u2010angle light scattering33 (SEC\u2010MALS) as well as native mass spectrometry confirmed the trimeric organization of the GCN4 stabilized MHV S ectodomain [Fig. 2(C)]. Proper folding of the purified MHV S ectodomain was confirmed by analyzing its binding affinity to the CEACAM1a ectodomain (the viral receptor) using microscale thermophoresis [Fig. 2(D)]. We determined a dissociation equilibrium constant of 48.5 \u00b1 3.8 nM which is in good agreement with the value of 21.4 \u00b1 4.2 nM reported by Peng et al.12 for the isolated receptor\u2010binding domain.

Ideally, the vitreous ice should be as thin as possible to still accommodate the particles of interest while maximizing Thon ring intensity at high spatial frequencies.34 Imaging was completed on a Titan Krios 300 kV microscope equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector operated in counting mode.18 Similarly to our previous work on the Thermoplasma acidophilum 20S proteasome, we initially sought to acquire data from holes having the thinnest possible vitreous ice.35 However, the MHV S protein clearly showed signs of denaturation when images where acquired in such conditions [Fig. 3(A)]. We interpret this observation as resulting from the surface tension exerted on the S trimers in thin vitreous ice. Hence, we targeted holes with slightly thicker ice than desired in which we could observe compact well\u2010folded MHV S trimers, similar to what was observed using negative staining EM [Fig. 3(B)]. We collected a large dataset (1,600 micrographs) at high defocus (2.0\u20135.0 \u00b5m) to maximize the low\u2010resolution contrast and our ability to align the particle images during subsequent processing. This example illustrates that although it is not always possible to acquire data in the thinnest possible areas of ice (especially for fragile protein complexes), near\u2010atomic resolution reconstructions can still be obtained by tailoring the imaging conditions appropriately.",

If left untreated, this heterogeneity can limit the resolution and compromise the quality of the final map. 3D classification has emerged as an extraordinarily powerful tool to deal with structural heterogeneity in allowing to computationally isolate homogeneous subsets of the data.36, 37, 38\n",

(B) SDS\u2010PAGE analysis of the secreted MHV S ectodomain confirms the lack of proteolytic processing during biogenesis. (C) Size exclusion chromatography coupled on line with multi\u2010angle light scattering (SEC\u2010MALS) showed the expressed protein forms a homotrimer. The deviation of the estimated molecular weight (463.2 \u00b1 0.3 kDa) from the theoretical one (418.9 kDa) likely corresponds to N\u2010linked glycans. The red line represents the molecular mass (left axis, Da) while the blue line represents the normalized refractive index (right axis, arbitrary units). (D) The MHV S ectodomain binds with high affinity to soluble CEACAM1a (the host receptor). We determined a dissociation equilibrium constant of 48.5 \u00b1 3.8 nM using microscale thermophoresis suggesting the protein is properly folded.
