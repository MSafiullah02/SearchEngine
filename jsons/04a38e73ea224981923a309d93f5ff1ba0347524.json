            "text": "Political trolls initiate online discord not only for the lulz (laughs), but also for ideological reasons, such as promoting their desired political candidates. Political troll groups recently gained spotlight because they were considered central in helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election, which involved difficult mass mobilizations. Political trolls face unique challenges as they must build their own communities while simultaneously disrupting others. However, little is known about how political trolls mobilize sufficient participation to suddenly become problems for others. We performed a quantitative longitudinal analysis of more than 16 million comments from one of the most popular and disruptive political trolling communities, the subreddit /r/The Donald (T D). We use T D as a lens to understand participation and collective action within these deviant spaces. In specific, we first study the characteristics of the most active participants to uncover what might drive their sustained participation. Next, we investigate how these active individuals mobilize their community to action. Through our analysis we uncover that the most active employed distinct discursive strategies to mobilize participation, and deployed technical tools like bots to create a shared identity and sustain engagement. We conclude by providing data-backed design implications for designers of civic media.",

The web existed in 1996, but did not become relevant until the 2000 campaign; blogs existed in 2000; but were not influential until 2004; Facebook existed in 2004, but only made a splash in 2008; Twitter existed in 2008, but did not become essential until 2012. What then should we make of the 2016 presidential campaign and the 2012-era technologies they adopted? We argue that information filtering platforms like reddit, which demonstrated their capabilities for coordinating influential collective action before 2012, were politically weaponized in 2016 in the form of trolling communities like /r/The Donald (T D). Trolling is hardly a new phenomenon (Phillips 2015) .",

We lack an understanding how these communities \"successfully\" self-organize to cause harm. We argue troll communities manage the same fundamental challenges faced by other online communities, especially sustaining participation and initiating collective action (Kraut et al. 2012 ). The success of troll communities allows them to become problems for other online communities by undermining generalized norms of credibility, trust, and respect, which are essential for democratic self-governance. A deeper understanding of how political trolls mobilize will enable better preparations for when 2016 socio-technical capabilities are applied in 2020 elections.",

T D received significant media coverage due to its coordinated trolling efforts intended to disrupt and harass Trump's opponents (MSNBC 2016; The-New-Yorker 2017) . Participants of T D trolled in various ways: they organized Netflix boycotts after Netflix promoted TV shows opposing their political views (Rare 2017; Decider 2017), orchestrated one-star Amazon reviews for Megyn Kelly's book (Huffington-Post 2016; Fortune 2016) . Members of T D also organized the \"Great Meme War\" to harass Trump's detractors and flood the Internet with pro-Trump, anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda (Politico 2017) . Participants of T D also actively promoted the use of satirical hashtags, such as #DraftOurDaughters to troll Hillary Clinton's initiative about supporting women to register for the military draft (Politico 2018) or #ShariaOur-Daughters to take Islam ideologies to an absurd extreme (Reddit 2016b).",

We considered that these were potentially bots or at least humans pretending to be bots. Their top 20 words with highest TF-IDF scores (for both potential bots and humans) corresponded to pro-Trump slang, such as: \"MAGA\" or \"Centipedes\". We also observed that the humans in this group constantly shared the same YouTube videos, usually whimsical videos promoting Trump.

Given the importance of slang among these most active users, we refined our analysis of their jargon. Figure 2 visualizes the relationships between the most active users' number of comments (X axis) against the number of comments they generated with slang (Y axis). Some of the accounts using the most slang were bots (they appear higher in the Y axis). Although bots were not a majority among the most active users (only 1% of all accounts), they produced the majority of the content with pro-Trump slang. However, these bots do appear to have been successful in engaging the community: the bots only generated content if people replied to them or if someone mentioned pro-Trump slang. If we see that the bots are among the most active it is because people were actively interacting with them or using their related slang words. The humans and the bots in T D constantly engaged with each other by commenting on each others' posts. Humans engaged with the bots to play games with them. The most active bots ( Figure 2 ) had a gamification component and were activated when participants used certain slang words or mentioned the bot. For example, in the \"TrumpTrainBot\" users are in charge of \"moving forward\" the \"Trump Train.\" This bot increases its speed each time people use pro-Trump slang or reply to the bot.

We used lists of action verbs to flag posts with possible calls to action. Through this process we identified 5,603 posts. Next, we hired three Englishspeaking college educated crowd workers from Upwork to categorize whether each of the posts made a call to action or not (it could be that the post had action verbs, but did not try to mobilize others.) The two coders agreed on 3,274 posts (Cohen's kappa: 0.58: Moderate agreement). We then asked a third coder to label the remaining posts upon which the first two coders disagreed. We used a \"majority rule\" approach to determine the category for those remaining posts. Once we had the posts categorized into \"call to action\" and \"non call to action\" posts, we identified the authors of the posts and characterized them based on their \"style\" for making calls to action. We considered each individual had a particular style for mobilizing others. Our goal was to cluster together the individuals that used the same style. For this purpose we represented each individual, as a vector where the components of the vector were: (1) the likelihood of making a call to action with a link attached: number of calls to action the person made with a link over their total number of calls to action; (2) likelihood of mentioning a public figure or organization: number of times public figures or organizations were mentioned over the total number of words in her calls to action (notice that similar procedure was followed for slang and profanity); (3) likelihood of using slang; and (4) likelihood of using profanity, (5) the median number of words in the call to action over the median number of words the person used in general in her posts.",

In general, the style of these calls to action appear to be based on creating a collective identity by utilizing slang supporting their political believes and promoting causes or stories that their opposition deems to be unreal. The creation of such collective identity might facilitate driving people to action, as language and the use of slang solidifies the identity of a group (Sarabia and Shriver 2004) . However, this style was in general the one that received the lowest engagement from the community (this style received the smallest median number of comments and upvotes). The slang and \"conspiracy theories\" might have been difficult for newcomers or less committed community members to follow, and hence their participation was more limited. However, we did observe that this call to action style was able to generate the largest number of upvotes for one post that called the community to take action and report an NBC employee that mocked Trump's 10-year old child, Barron:",

The profanity used was against political situations and was rarely used to attack political opponents). This style did not directly give people orders, but rather suggested which actions were needed. Suggestions to take action were also frequently followed by the assertion that said action was already performed by others, including the person that made the suggestion in the first place. For instance, the following post explains to people why they should eliminate their Netflix account (as it supports the opposition's ideology), and showcases that the poster has herself already cancelled her account: \"...All the more reason that we should dump Netflix. Their \"Dear White People Show\" they released is a bit too preachy. If Soros is funding, hell yes, I'm done.

To determine whether there are significant differences between the three datasets (i.e., between the number of comments and upvotes that a type of call to action style receives), we used a Kruskal-Wallis H test to investigate the similarities/differences between the number of comments and upvotes across call to action styles. The test statistic for the number of upvotes was H = 23.066 with p-value <.001. The test statistics for the comments was H = 33.587 with p-value <.001. Therefore, the median number of comments that each style received was significantly different. Overall, the community's engagement with each call to action style was different. We believe that the \"Historian\" style helped to maintain the community continuously engaged and on the same page about what was occurring in the political ecosystem.

In T D to mobilize others it was most important to explain in detail the political ecosystem and educate the public about the meaning of certain events. This was the most effective strategy in mobilizing other T D participants long term (highest retention). The individuals with most sustained participation used socio-technical tools, such as bots, to maintain themselves engaged and entertained. Our findings can help to design novel civic media and troll moderation strategies.",
