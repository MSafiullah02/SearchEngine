Care must be taken not to damage the underlying structures.Locate the trachea and, using small scissors and forceps, dissect it away from the surrounding tissues (see\nNote 6).Cut the trachea at the levels of the carina and larynx and remove it from the embryo, placing the tissue in a Bijou bottle containing culture medium (see\nNote 7).Repeat steps 3\u20137 for all available embryos.Place one trachea at a time on a disc of filter paper and, using two pairs of fine forceps, gently remove as much fat as possible (see\nNote 8).Place the cleaned tracheas in a 100-mm Petri dish containing culture medium.Swab the McIlwain tissue chopper with 70% IMS.Place two filter paper discs on top of the PVC cutting table disc and slide the assembled discs under the cutting table clips on the tissue chopper.Raise the chopping arm of the tissue chopper and attach the razor blade.Position the arm over the center of the cutting table (see\nNote 9).Place tracheas on to the filter paper under, and perpendicular to, the raised blade (see\nNote 10).Adjust the machine to cut sections 0.5\u20131.0 mm thick and activate the chopping arm.Once the arm has stopped moving, discard the first few rings from each end of the cut tracheas; then, with a scalpel, scrape the remaining rings into a 150-mm Petri dish containing culture medium.With a large-bore glass Pasteur pipette gently aspirate the medium to disperse the cut tissue into individual rings.Repeat steps 12\u201318 until all the tracheas have been sectioned (see\nNote 11).\n",

Wrap the dish in aluminum foil and sterilize in a hot air oven (160\u00b0C for 1 h).Batches of sterile tubes can be prepared by placing them, open end down, in suitable sized lidded tins lined with aluminum foil. Sterilize in a hot air oven as above.Batches of sterile silicone rubber bungs can be prepared by placing them, narrow end down, in shallow, lidded tins. Sterilize by autoclaving.Preparation of TOCs can be performed on the open laboratory bench after cleaning the surfaces with 70% IMS or any other suitable disinfectant.Care must be taken at this stage not to damage the trachea.The trachea can be identified by the presence of transverse ridges seen down its length owing to the underlying rings of cartilage.The carina and larynx can be identified by the increased diameter at the ends of the trachea.To avoid damage to the trachea hold it as close to one end as possible with the first pair of forceps and use the second pair to strip away the fatty tissue.At this stage gently lower the arm onto the cutting area disc, loosen the screw holding the blade slightly, check that the blade is aligned correctly (the full length of the blade must be in contact with cutting area), tighten the screw again, and raise the arm.A maximum of five tracheas can be laid side by side on the cutting bed at any one time. Gently stretch each trachea as it is placed on the cutting area, and when all five are in the correct position, wet them with a few drops of culture medium.It is important to use a fresh blade edge and paper discs for each set of five tracheas to be sectioned.Check for damaged glass tubes at this stage, particularly around the rims. Discard any with cracks as these can fail when bungs are inserted, leading to injured fingers.Make sure the tracheal rings are fully submerged in culture medium and not stuck on the wall of the tube. Discard any that appear ragged or incomplete.The speed of the roller apparatus is quite slow. Check that the tube roller is actually moving before leaving the cultures to incubate.A simple quantal assay for infectivity of IBV has been described by Cook et al. (7) and used extensively in our Institute. Five tubes of TOCs per tenfold serial dilution of virus gives sufficiently accurate results for most purposes. A simplification of the method of Cook et al. (1976), used for many years by Cavanagh and colleagues, is to add 0.5 ml of diluted virus per TOC tube without prior removal of the medium already in the tube. TOCs are scored as positive for virus when ciliary activity is completely abrogated. If a virus is poorly ciliostatic, its presence can be demonstrated using indirect immunofluorescence, with the TOCs conveniently not fixed (8).\n",
