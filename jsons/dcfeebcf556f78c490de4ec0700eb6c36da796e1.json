These each plasmid solution were 10-fold diluted with nucleic acids extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs from non-COVID19 patients (n=9). RT-PCR analysis have already validated there are no amplification was observed in non-COVID-19 patients in advance. RT-PCR analysis were conducted using serial dilution solution with final input copies numbers (ranged 10 to 10,000). (B) Average threshold cycle (Ct) were determined by RT-PCR. Two sets of primers and probes (pink, NIID-N1; blue, NIID-N2) were used according to NIID, Japan. The experiment was conducted three times in duplicate.",
