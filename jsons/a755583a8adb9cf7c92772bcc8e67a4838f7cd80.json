Fever, cough, fatigue, and myalgia are usually the main symptoms. The expression of COVID-19 ILI seems non-specific; no specific symptom can lead to suspecting a case without any notion of exposure [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . A major French cluster of COVID-19 began on March 1, 2020 in the city of Mulhouse, France (less than 30 miles from our hospital). After clinical examination of the first patients, we noticed that many cases reported anosmia. The description of anosmia and other ENT symptoms is scarce with COVID- 19 . For instance, a recent review on COVID-19 by ENT specialists on March 26 emphasized that ENT symptoms were uncommon with COVID-19 as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were observed in less than 5% of cases. However, they noticed that there were few reports of anosmia and dysgeusia with no real description of symptoms [8] . Recently, in April, descriptions of cases of anosmia in a multicentric cohort have been associated with COVID-19 [9] [10] [11] . We aimed to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia in COVID-19 patients.",

However, 54 (47%) of our 114 COVID-19 patients reported anosmia. Lechien et al. reported anosmia in 86% (n=357/417) of their patients. This higher frequency may be explained by their population profile which were ambulatory cases who consulted at ENT consultations (patients with a mean age of 37 [\u00b1 11.4] years without cardiovascular comorbidities) and for whom it is probably easier to relate functional symptoms than patients with oxygen therapy or critical patients. Anosmia was therefore a frequent symptom in COVID-19 patients in our French study and in this European study.",

On the other hand, it is difficult to precisely report ENT symptoms of critical patients. These symptoms may seem of less importance when considering the potential severity of the disease [15] . Anosmia was associated with dysgeusia in 85% of cases and in more than half of cases with rhinorrhea (57%). However, 70% of our patients with anosmia did not present with nasal obstruction. This leads to suspecting another pathogenesis for anosmia than mechanical nasal obstruction. In addition, anosmia during viral rhinitis with nasal obstruction usually resolves within three days [16], while we observed a mean duration of anosmia of nine days. The concept of anosmia after viral infection is known as post-infectious/post-viral olfactory loss (POL). Different kind of viruses can induce POL, including coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E [17] . However, medical literature data indicates that the duration of POL can be long: a study of 63 patients with POL reported that after one year 80% of patients had subjective recovery [18] . In our study, only one patient did not recover at the end of the study follow-up (after a follow-up of 28 days); 80% of our patients recovered within 14 days. Compared with POL, the outcome of COVID-19-related acute anosmia most frequently seems favorable in the short term.",
