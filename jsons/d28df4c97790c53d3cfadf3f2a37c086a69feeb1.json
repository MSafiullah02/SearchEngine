Llnle evidence of epithelial cell staining for collagenase was seen !n any tissue. In carcinomas. both slromal flbrotlasts and collagen fibres stained strongly and stromal staining was stronger close to neoplastic glands. Vascular staining was more prominent in neoplastic than normal tlswes. perhaps reflecting the increased proteolytic activity dunng tumour angiogeness. The pattern of TIMP immunostainlng was smilar to that of collagenase, although basement membrane staining for TIMP was generally more marked.

It has been suggested that these vanant lines might be the equlvalent of the large cell bronchial endocrine carcinomas sometimes seen I \" YIYO, but this is not proven. We have used th0 Myc 1 -9E10 monoclonal antibody and the avidin-biotin technique to study the panem of expression of the p62 oncoprotein product of the c-myc gene in turnour deposits of twelve subjects coming to necropsy with disseminated small cell carcinoma in an attempt to relate 11 l o morphological vanablity and metastatic site. Anhough expression bore no relationship to morphological vanation. it ohen differed markedly horn site to slte. Whereas parts of the primary t m w r strongly overexpressed the protein ~n all but one wbfect, there was considerable vanability between secondary deposits.

In addition to being of biological interest, such molecules may prove useful as operatcanal mahers of quiescent cell populationS in histological material and allow the further characterisation of cellular subpopulations. One such molecule IS statin. a 57kD protein previously reported to be expressed only by cells ~n Go. We have shown bylaserconfocalfluarescence microscopythat thestatin antigen is associated with the nuclear envelope with a dstnbution 51m1l ar to that of nuclear lamins. Using a monoclonal antibody (5-44) that recognises slatin we have defined the tissue distribution of statin immunoreactivlty in a range of ContinUOUSly renewing, conditionaily renewing and non-renewing tissues. The distribution Of immunoreactivlty 1s essentially as would be expected of a maher of quiescent ceils. In contrast. in established pancreatic Carcinoma and other epithelial ceil lines. we have found $latin immunoreactivity ~n cycling cells using biotinylated K67 Slatin double labelling techniques. In ConcIusion. statin lmmunoreactivitv in normal tissues Correlates with auiescence but this realtionship IS lost, at least in vifro. 10 Loss of cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion are imponantfactors during turnourprogression. Tumour promoten are Compounds Which although not carcinogenic themsews increase the frequency of turnour development in animals previously exposed to carcinogens. We have used the turnour promoter TPA on cultured human renal epithelia ~ells10 mimic nwplastlc transformation. Following TPA treatment we haveexamined thedistribution of vlnculin, B1 integrin and actin within thetreatedcells byfluorescencemicroscopy.Treatment of therenal epithelium by TPAcauses arounding up of the cells and a loss of adhesion toeither laminin Or fibronecttn substrata Fiuorescent microscopic examination reveals a progressive loss of reactivity for vinculin and B1 inlegrin within local Conlacts. These changes are accompanied by a redistribution of the actin microfilaments from Orientated bundles of Stress fibres to a circumferential arrangement These Changesofareduction in focal contact componentsand disarganised actin cytoskeietan mimic the changes we have previously described in renal Carcinoma. Glutathione s-transferases are a diverse group Of enzymes with an important role !n the metabolism 01 faelgn compounds including Some carcinogens and Cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

This almost certainly reflects the tendency of pathologists to lump together different lesions under the broad heading 'haemangioma', sometimes with capillarylcavernous subtyping. Twelve cases of a distinctive subset of cavernous haemangiomas, to be known as sinusoidai haemangioma, are presented. These presented in adWs (8 female. 4 male. mean age 49 years. range 2&77). Five arose in the upper limb and five an the trunk (of which two developed in mammary subcutis). All were solitary and presented as a bluish cutanmus swelling up to 3.5 cm in diameter of variable duration. One case was associated with ipsilateral gynaecomastia. Average foiiow-up of 5.6 years has revealed no tendency far local recurrence or metastasis. Histologically these were subCutaneouS/deep dermal lesions with a lobular, sieve-like appearance and focally ill-defined margins. They were composed of dilated. thin-walled interwmmunicating vascular channels with a pseudopapillary architecture. Thrombi were common and two cases showed central infarction. Vascular spaces were lined by monolayered endothelium Which was often plump and hyperchromatic but n d mitotic. Distinction from wnventional cavernous haemangioma and angiosarcoma (particularly in breast lesions) is discussed. Current methods forthe identification of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSVJ may fail to identity the presence ofthe Virus in biopsy or autopsy material. We have investigated 2 autopsy cases and 3 neurosurgical biopsy cases of clinically suspected Herpes Simplex Encephalitis by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA was extracted from routineiyprocessedand paraffin embedded material byproteinase K incubation, phenol chloroform extractionand ethanol precipitation. Nested PCR was performed using known oligonmlaotide primers designed from the HSVtype 1 giywprotein D gene from an area with the lowest homology with HSV type 2. Two of 2 autopsy c a w and 2 of 3 neurosurgical biopsy cases ware PCR positive for HSV. The third neurosurgical biopsy case was not confirmed by PCR as being due to HSV. Such primers lo HSV allow the rapid retraspeaive diagnosis of Herpes Simplex Encephaliis and Should be of value to neurapathologists.

It is well recognised that morphology and optical reSOiution are vastly improved with resin as opposed to paraffin embedding of tissue. However, difficulties in producing consistent immunopetoxidase reactions on resin sections have caused many departments to abandon thetechnique. Although antigenicity is preserved the low optical density of Diaminobenzidine (DAE) means that the reaction product is barely visible in thin resin Sections.

Well dmerentiated liposarcoma IS one of the most common Sarcomas accuning m late adult life. Characteristically affecting the deep muScleSaftheextremities, theretropentonealspace. and the groin, this tumor ischaractenzed by varying amounts of mature fat interspersed with fibrous bands, atypical hyperchromaric spmdledceiis, and lipoblasts. These lesions are considered low grade Sarcomas having a high rate of local recurrence but no abilny to metastaslze. Recently Evans and Ammi eial Suggested that well-differentiated liposarcomas occurring m the wbcutaneous tissue and muxles of the extremity cause so hnle morbidity that the use of the term \"atypical lipma\" Should be used rather than Ihposarcoma. in contrast. well-differentiated liposarcomas in the retropentoneum cause significant morbidihl and pose a significant risk of death from local disease. Thus. nearly all pathologists agree that the term \"weii differentiated lipasarcoma\" Should be retained for these tumors ~n the retroperitoneum. However. none of these recent studies have followed a large number of these tumors for a proianged period at time m order to assess the long term behavior and specihcalty risk that such 1es1ons may progresswith time to a higher grade lesions (1.9 dedifferentiate).
