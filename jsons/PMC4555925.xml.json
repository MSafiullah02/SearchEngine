            "text": "Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) family and are expressed differentially on the surfaces of cells (Gray-Owen & Blumberg, 2006 \u25b8; Tchoupa et al., 2014 \u25b8). There are 12 CEACAMs found in humans: CEACAM1, CEACAM3\u2013CEACAM8, CEACAM16 and CEACAM18\u2013CEACAM21 (Beauchemin & Arabzadeh, 2013 \u25b8; Tchoupa et al., 2014 \u25b8). Their functions and roles in cellular processes are diverse and include roles in phagocytosis, hearing, proliferation, signaling, tumor suppression and cell adhesion (Oikawa et al., 1989 \u25b8, 1991 \u25b8; Benchimol et al., 1989 \u25b8; Streichert et al., 2001 \u25b8; Pils et al., 2008 \u25b8; Singer et al., 2010 \u25b8; Zheng et al., 2011 \u25b8). CEACAMs are typically dysregulated in cancer and are found to be parasitized by bacteria (e.g.\nNeisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae) and viruses in mice (e.g. coronavirus) during infection (Dveksler et al., 1991 \u25b8; Leusch et al., 1991 \u25b8; Bos et al., 1997 \u25b8; Sch\u00f6lzel et al., 2000 \u25b8; Virji et al., 2000 \u25b8; Duxbury et al., 2004 \u25b8; Litkouhi et al., 2008 \u25b8; Obrink, 2008 \u25b8; Singer et al., 2010 \u25b8). CEACAMs contain an N-terminal immunoglobulin variable domain (IgV), a variable number of immuno\u00adglobulin constant domains (IgC2) and either a C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain or a glycophos\u00adphatidyl-inositol (GPI) moiety by which they are anchored to the plasma membrane (Tchoupa et al., 2014 \u25b8). Cell adhesion is achieved through the N-terminal domain of CEACAMs, which can undergo heterodimerization and homodimerization in a cis (on the same cell) or trans (across different cells) fashion (Taheri et al., 2000 \u25b8; Kuroki et al., 2001 \u25b8; Watt et al., 2001 \u25b8).",

            "text": "CEACAM7 is expressed on highly differentiated epithelial cells of the colon and rectum and on the epithelial cells within the ducts of the pancreas (Sch\u00f6lzel et al., 2000 \u25b8). The expression pattern of CEACAM7 suggests a specialized function. In fetal tissues of the colon, CEACAM7 is located at the base of epithelial cells and has been found to migrate to the apical surface a few days after birth (Sch\u00f6lzel et al., 2000 \u25b8). CEACAM7 contains three domains: an N-terminal IgV domain, a single IgC2 domain and a cell-surface GPI anchor domain (Tchoupa et al., 2014 \u25b8). CEACAM7 expression is downregulated during the early development of colorectal tumors, unlike CEACAM5 or CEACAM6, which are typically upregulated, suggesting a tumor-suppression function (Sch\u00f6lzel et al., 2000 \u25b8). Currently, it is unknown whether CEACAM7 is involved in cell adhesion through homodimerization or if any structural differences exist that could potentially allow CEACAM7 to function as a tumor-suppression molecule when compared with the two known structures of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 (Fedarovich et al., 2006 \u25b8; Korotkova et al., 2008 \u25b8). Here, we report the 1.47 \u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of CEACAM7 and have characterized its oligomeric state in solution.",

CEACAM7 was expressed in inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Briefly, 1 l of cells were grown in LB Miller at 310 K until an OD600 nm of \u223c0.6 was attained, prior to induction with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were grown for a further 4 h before harvesting (5000g for 15 min at 277 K). The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100 pH 7.5] and lysed by sonication. Inclusion bodies were isolated (20 000g for 20 min at 277 K), resuspended in lysis buffer, sonicated and isolated by centrifugation (20 000g for 20 min at 277 K). Inclusion bodies were washed with a high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 1.0 M NaCl pH 8.0) to remove DNA, followed by lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Inclusion bodies were dissolved in 30 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 8.0 M urea pH 8.3 (\u223c5 ml per litre of grown cells), refolded by rapid dilution (1:12 ratio) at 277 K into 50 mM CHES\u2013HCl, 500 mM\nl-arginine pH 9.2 and left for 24 h. Refolded CEACAM7 was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0 and concentrated by anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q, GE Healthcare). A linear salt gradient from 0 to 1000 mM was run at 1 ml min\u22121 over 15 min, with CEACAM7 eluting at between 50 and 100 mM NaCl. CEACAM7 was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 and fractions were stored at 277 K.

The overall fold of CEACAM7 is similar to those of the other CEACAMs that have been determined previously. The overall topology is that of the V-set fold of the immunoglobulin superfamily, comprised of two \u03b2-sheets labeled ABED and A\u2032GFCC\u2032C\u2032\u2032. The sheets are connected by the BC, EF, C\u2032\u2032D and AA\u2032 loops (Fig. 1 \u25b8\nb). The r.m.s.d.s of the CEACAM7 molecules to each other are low (\u223c0.30 \u00c5), showing no structural differences within the asymmetric unit. The four molecules of CEACAM7 form two pairs of dimers (Fig. 1 \u25b8\nc). The dimer interface is formed from the second \u03b2-sheet, A\u2032GFCC\u2032C\u2032\u2032, specifically the GFCC\u2032C\u2032\u2032 strands and the CC\u2032, C\u2032C\u2032\u2032 and FG loops (Fig. 1 \u25b8\nc). Dimerization buries 1610 \u00c52 of solvent-accessible surface area as calculated by PISA (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007 \u25b8). This is similar to the CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 homodimers, which bury 1600 and 1460 \u00c52 of solvent-accessible surface area, respectively. The shape-complementarity value (Sc; Lawrence & Colman, 1993 \u25b8) is 0.68, which is smaller than those for the other CEACAMs, with values of 0.81 and 0.72 for CEACAM1 and CEACAM5, respectively. CEACAM7 forms nine hydrogen bonds in the dimerization interface. This is more than CEACAM5 (six hydrogen bonds) but less than CEACAM1 (16 hydrogen bonds). Of the 38 residues in CEACAM7 that differ from CEACAM1 and CEACAM5, eight are found in the dimerization interface.",

Superposition of CEACAM7 onto the CEACAM1 dimer using the same method reveals similar r.m.s.d.s of 0.83 \u00c5 for molecule A and 2.26 \u00c5 for molecule B (Fig. 2 \u25b8\nb). Closer comparison of CEACAM7 with CEACAM5 and CEACAM1 shows two major regions of deviation. The first is the BC loop (residues 23\u201329), which is not involved in the dimerization interface (Fig. 2 \u25b8\nc). This region is highly conserved among members of the CEACAM family; however, positions 25\u201326 of CEACAM7 differ from those of the other CEACAMs. In all other CEACAMs these residues are Leu25 and Pro26. However, in CEACAM7 they are Glu25 and Ser26. The loss of Pro26 is likely to reduce the rigidity of the loop. The r.m.s.d. of this loop in CEACAM7 is 3.10 \u00c5 relative to CEACAM5 and the displacement of this loop causes a slight movement of the N-terminal \u03b2-strand. Notably, the preceding residue is Asn24, a unique N-linked glycosylation site found only in CEACAM7 and CEACAM4. Three other glycosylation sites are present in CEACAM7 (Asn52, Asn72 and Asn79). These are highlighted in Fig. 2 \u25b8(d), showing that none are found in the dimerization interface. Glycosylation of CEACAM5 has been shown to be important for interaction with CD8\u03b1 (Roda et al., 2014 \u25b8) and therefore may also be important for CEACAM7 function.",

CEACAM7 is unique compared with other CEACAMs, as the C\u2032C\u2032\u2032 loop contains a single amino-acid insertion (isoleucine) between residues 52 and 53. To accommodate the insertion in the C\u2032C\u2032\u2032 loop without altering the length of the C\u2032C\u2032\u2032 or the C\u2032\u2032D loops, the C\u2032\u2032 strand is found to be distorted relative to CEACAM5 (Fig. 3 \u25b8\na) and CEACAM1 (Fig. 3 \u25b8\nb). The C\u2032\u2032 strand bulges in the center (residues 56\u201360), causing breakages of hydrogen bonds in the antiparallel \u03b2-sheet between the C\u2032 and C\u2032\u2032 strands. The C\u2032\u2032 strand of CEACAM7 is held in place through a hydrogen bond from the O\u220a2 atom of Asn57 to the N atom of Gly48 (Fig. 3 \u25b8\nc). In CEACAM5 the carbonyl group of Thr57 forms the hydrogen bond to Gly48 (Fig. 3 \u25b8\nd). Although the C\u2032\u2032 strand does not buckle in CEACAM1, as in CEACAM5, it is found that Thr57 does form a hydrogen bond across the dimerization interface to Asp95 (Fig. 3 \u25b8\ne). This buckling of the C\u2032\u2032 strand creates an extra interaction in the dimerization interface, potentially explaining why CEACAM7 forms such tight dimers and has not been found to form heterodimeric CEACAM complexes such as CEACAM6\u2013CEACAM8, CEACAM1\u2013CEACAM8, CEACAM1\u2013CEACAM6, CEACAM3\u2013CEACAM6 and CEACAM5\u2013CEACAM6 (Oikawa et al., 1991 \u25b8; Kuroki et al., 2001 \u25b8; Skubitz & Skubitz, 2008 \u25b8; Singer et al., 2014 \u25b8). Although CEACAM1 does not buckle, it too creates an extra interaction across the dimerization through reorientation of Asp95. This also suggests that this hydrogen bond is important for a higher affinity interaction.",
