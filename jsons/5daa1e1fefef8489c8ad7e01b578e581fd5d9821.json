In other species, ronidazole and its metabolites are excreted in urine and feces. 8, 9 It is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and biodegraded, and is found in its intact form only in muscle. 10, 11 The primary mechanism of action of most nitroimidazoles (including ronidazole) is thought to be related to production of nitro anion radicals, 12, 13 leading to destabilization of deoxyribonucleic acid. Hydrogenosomes are specialized double-membrane-bound organelles responsible for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a process that involves generating hydrogen and are found in some eukaryotic microbes that inhabit oxygen-deficient environments. Within hydrogenosomes, an electron transport system using ferredoxin oxidoreductase and the electron carrier ferredoxin transfers electrons to the nitro group of 5-nitroimidazoles. 14 However, ferredoxin oxidoreductase is absent in T foetus organisms that are resistant to metronidazole, 15, 16 suggesting that ronidazole may have other mechanisms of action and is likely cidal to Trichomonas via other unknown reductive pathways.",

These signs were first observed in the dogs within 1-2 weeks of therapy at high doses (100-200 mg/kg/d), and after 5-8 weeks with a dose of 50 mg/kg/d. A dose of 25 mg/kg/d 5 days per week was well tolerated for up to 17 weeks (the duration of the study). Long-term studies also revealed neurologic effects at much lower doses. At 10 mg/kg/d occasional fine tremors were noted; dogs administered 20 mg/kg/d were hyperreactive; and dogs administered 30 mg/kg/d suffered anorexia, weight loss, ataxia, and clonic-tonic seizures. At postmortem examination, all dogs receiving $20 mg/kg/ d, 5 days a week for 1 to 2 years had gross lesions, including slight hydrocephalus; subdural hemorrhage; and pale yellowish coloration of the brain, and histopathologic lesions, including focal hemorrhage of the cerebellum, leukomalacia, vascularization, and neurophagia. Other findings included cardiac hemorrhage, testicular atrophy, aspermatogenesis, and oligos-permia. Similar testicular changes have been noted in rats receiving similar doses for 2 years. No neurologic changes were reported in rodents; however, a significant decrease in survival of rats at $20 mg/kg/d was reported.",

Ronidazole levels were not measured, and other potential concurrent diseases were not completely ruled out. However, resolution of signs with discontinuation of ronidazole, as well as a recurrence of the same signs with the reintroduction of the drug in the first case lends support to the hypothesis that ronidazole was responsible for these cats' neurologic signs. Neurologic signs were consistent with those reported in other species and were similar to adverse effects reported with use of other medications within the same drug class. These 4 cats received no other medications during the ronidazole treatment period, and there were no other obvious causes for the signs.",

It is not possible to determine from these cases whether the toxicity of ronidazole in cats might be dose-dependent as suggested by experimental studies involving dogs and rats.

Although all cats had complete resolution of their neurologic signs, it may be prudent to discontinue use of ronidazole even if only mild neurologic abnormalities are seen. Clearly, further investigation of ronidazole activity and side effects in felines is necessary. At present, we recommend that the use of ronidazole be limited to confirmed cases of T foetus infection and that owners be educated about the potential adverse effects of this medication. ",
