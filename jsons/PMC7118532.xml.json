The disease rapidly spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency (WHO, 2020). The mental health of medical and nursing staff has been greatly challenged during the immediate wake of the viral epidemic (Chong et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2009). In battling the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), psychological distress among medical staff appeared gradually: fear and anxiety appeared immediately and decreased in the early stages of the epidemic, but depression, psychophysiological symptoms and posttraumatic stress symptoms appeared later and lasted for a long time, leading to profound impacts (Chong et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2009). Being isolated, working in high-risk positions, and having contact with infected people are common causes of trauma (Wu et al., 2009, Maunder et al., 2003). These factors may have impacted medical and nursing staff in Wuhan, leading to mental health problems.",

Efficient and comprehensive actions should be taken in a timely fashion to protect the mental health of medical staff. The Chinese government has made various efforts to reduce the pressure on medical and nursing staff in China, such as sending more medical and nursing staff to reduce work intensity, adopting strict infection control, providing personal protective equipment and offering practical guidance. Based on previous responses to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), medical staff tend to believe that such measures help protect their mental health (Khalid et al., 2016). In addition, to reduce the psychological damage of COVID-19 among medical and nursing staff, mental health workers in Wuhan are also taking action by establishing psychological intervention teams and providing a range of psychological services, including providing psychological brochures, counseling and psychotherapy (Kang et al., 2020). At the same time, television news and online media are also disseminating information about coping strategies for psychological self-help. However, evidence-based mental health services are preferable, and it is necessary to assess the quality of mental health services (Aarons et al., 2012). Therefore, we explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan, the efficacy of the psychological care accessed, and their psychological care needs.",

The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used to evaluate depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress, respectively. The PHQ-9 is a self-report measure used to assess the severity of depression, with the total scores categorized as follows: minimal/no depression (0\u20134), mild depression (5\u20139), moderate depression (10\u201314), or severe depression (15\u201321) (Kocalevent et al., 2013). The GAD-7 is a self-rated scale to evaluate the severity of anxiety and has good reliability and validity. The total scores are categorized as follows: minimal/no anxiety (0\u20134), mild anxiety (5\u20139), moderate anxiety (10\u201314), or severe anxiety (15\u201321) (L\u00f6we et al., 2008). The ISI is a measure of insomnia severity that has been shown to be valid and reliable. The total scores are categorized as follows: normal (0\u20137), subthreshold (8\u201314), moderate insomnia (15\u201321), or severe insomnia (22\u201328) (Morin et al., 2011). The IES-R is a self-report measure used to assess the response to a specific stressful life event and has extensive reliability and validity. The event used for this questionnaire was the occurrence of COVID-19. The total scores are categorized as follows: subclinical (0\u20138), mild distress (9\u201325), moderate distress (26\u201343), and severe distress (44\u201388) (Daniel and Weiss, 2007).",

Descriptive analysis was used to describe the general data and currently accessed psychological services. For count data, frequencies and percentages were used. The k-means clustering method was used to cluster the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores (Ball, 1967). With the Euclidean square root distance as the measurement index, the patients were divided into 4 groups by the Ward method. According to this grouping, exposure to COVID-19 and the current state of mental healthcare services were compared. The chi-square test was used to compare the data for different categorical variables. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed via Mplus to explore the relationship among the four components, namely, exposure, accessed mental healthcare services, mental health status (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R scores) and self-perceived health status compared to that before the COVID-19 outbreak. The estimation method used weighted least squares with mean and variance adjustment test statistics (Distefano and Morgan, 2014). We used a Monte Carlo method with 1000 guided resamplings to construct a confidence interval for the estimation effect (Bauer et al., 2006). In SEM, several criteria, such as root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) values < 0.08 and comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) values >0.90, indicate acceptable models (Hu and Bentler, 1998). P values < 0.05 indicated that a difference was statistically significant.",

These skills have been shown in previous retrospective studies to be protective for later mental health (Maunder et al., 2006). In addition, we note that people with subthreshold and mild mental health disturbances want to find ways to better help others, which is beneficial for health care teams. In terms of physiology, positive coping has been seen to increase immune function when victimized subjects report high mental demands, leading to a better state of response (Sakami et al., 2004). However, there are negative consequences of stimulation caused by pressure, as acute psychological stress is known to activate the sympathetic adrenal medulla system and hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis, and this two-component stress response impacts physical and mental health and has disease consequences (Turner et al., 2020). In summary, continuous mental healthcare services are necessary even for subthreshold and mild psychological reactions during this epidemic to attenuate the possibility of escalating complications.",

Our data are consistent with a model in which psychological advice and guidance in print resources and disseminated in the media can provide a level of protection for medical and nursing staff, improving mental health by reducing the stress impacts caused by high risk of infection. Clearly, there is a role, nonetheless, for therapist-driven sessions, as previous research showed that a convenient group course intervention for doctors reduced depersonalization, improved views on the meaning of work, and achieved sustained results (West et al., 2014).

Health care workers with professional knowledge about differences in the relative exposure patterns and transmission of different infectious diseases could gain some degree of comfort and control over their situations (Chowell et al., 2015). For example, over the decades, although hepatitis viruses and HIV have often caused lethal infections, radiologists, pathologists and nurses knew that their risk of exposure was low as long as they exercised caution in their contact with bodily fluids. The situation has been different in Wuhan due to the pernicious characteristics of COVID-19. Many infected individuals exhibit minimal or no symptoms while contagious, for example, early in the course of infection (Bai et al., 2020). These individuals may thus visit a variety of different hospital departments in an infectious but asymptomatic state, unknowingly spreading the disease directly through aerosolized droplets or indirectly through skin contact with handled surfaces. These features of the infectivity of coronavirus involve a substantial risk of exposure for medical workers, regardless of their hospital department, job title or building location; thus, any worker \u2013 whether doctor or nurse, specialist or generalist \u2013 is at substantial risk.
