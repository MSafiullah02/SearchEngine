Vaccination has been a strategy to protect against viral diseases in adults, such as influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, shingles and hepatitis A/B. Successful prophylactic vaccination mechanisms provide protection through eliciting neutralizing antibodies to prevent viral entry into cells. However, this strategy does not provide protection against antigenic shift or drift variants of the original virus [1, 2]. Currently, there are at least three known variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [3].",

In essence, an elderly immune system modulated by allo-priming would potentially respond to viral infection in a similar manner to the immune response of younger individuals, resulting in less serious disease. The immunomodulation of the elderly immune system to function more like a youthful immune system should also restore responsiveness to any current or future viral-specific vaccines.

IL-12 production acts to further increases IFN-\u03d2, sustaining the anti-viral state and upregulating MHCI, MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules on APC [24, 25]. The mature DC migrate to regional lymph nodes and display viral antigens on MHC I and MHC II with co-stimulator CD80/86 expression, leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL expansion. The IFN-\u03d2 upregulates MHCI on viral infected cells so these cells can be recognized and killed by viral-specific CTL [26].

To assure the injected cells are activated when administered, they are prepared with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated microbeads attached. The activated AlloStim\u00ae cells are formulated as a frozen dosage form at 1 \u00d7 107 cells/ml in PlasmaLyte A containing 1% human serum albumin and 2% DSMO. Individual doses of 0.5 ml are thawed and administered intradermally every 3\u20134 days for up to five total doses. This priming schedule is sufficient to provide high titers of circulating allo-specific Th1/CTL. AlloStim\u00ae has been evaluated in Phase I/II, Phase II and Phase IIA clinical trials in USA and Thailand in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic solid tumor patients. Phase IIB pre-registration and Phase IIB/III randomized, controlled registration clinical trials are currently being prepared for launch in third line metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in USA and Asia, respectively. In these human clinical trials, AlloStim\u00ae has demonstrated ability to down-regulate checkpoint molecules in the tumor microenvironment, cause system-wide infiltration of effector T-cells and NK cells into metastatic lesions (conversion from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d) and has consistently demonstrated a tail of between 20 and 35% of long-term survivors in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic disease with a good safety profile [32, 33].",

Modulating the immune system of elderly individuals through alloantigen priming to provide high titers of non-exhausted Th1/CTL memory cells that can be non-specifically activated upon encounter with any virus to cause release type 1 cytokines may provide an immediate anti-viral immune response upon viral exposure and could also reinstate responsiveness to viral vaccines [85]. The delay in IFN responses to virus infection in the elderly is due to active suppression by viral proteins and immunosenescence [86], which allows virus to reach high titers early in infection, leading to immunopathology, T-cell apoptosis and progression to lethal pneumonia [87, 88].",

Establishment of the anti-viral state with early release of IFN-\u03d2 provides a crucial initial line of defense against viral infection [91]. The anti-viral state is normally induced through early release of type I/III IFN from viral infected cells [92]. However, many viruses, including coronavirus, can suppress production of type I/III IFN as an immune avoidance mechanism [93\u201396]. The strategy of providing a pool of non-exhausted memory cells which produce Type II IFN (IFN-\u03d2) upon viral encounter, overcomes the viral escape. IFN-\u03d2 creates an anti-viral state even in type I/III IFN resistant cells [97]. Further, IFN-\u03d2 mobilizes innate effector cells that can respond rapidly to eliminate viral infection [98] and also produce IFN-\u03d2. Thus, early IFN-\u03d2 response to viral infection through allo-priming provides a rapid means of control over viral infection in the elderly.",

The features of sepsis-induced immunosuppression, independent of age, share many of the same characteristics of immunosenescence. During the last decades, there has been a significant increase in incidence of sepsis in patients over 65 years of age [112]. Many respiratory virus patients that progress to develop pneumonia and ARDS [113, 114] later die due to sepsis.",
