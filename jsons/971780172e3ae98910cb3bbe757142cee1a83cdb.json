Of the infected healthcare workers, 31 (77.5%) worked in the general wards, 7 (17.5%) in the emergency department, and 2 (5%) in the ICU [15] . More than 10 healthcare workers in the surgical department were presumed to have been infected by the first COVID-19 patient. Patient-to-patient and healthcare-worker-to-healthcare-worker transmission was presumed to have occurred. Therefore, the general department, especially the surgical department, is a department with high incidence of infection among healthcare worker in 476 medical institutions in China were reported, of which 25 died [6] . As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO [7] .These data show that COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speed, and can cause serious infection among healthcare worker. The lack of COVID-19 research in the early stages of the disease is one reason for healthcare worker to have neglected protection. In the middle stage of the disease, it was confirmed that COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, close contact, and aerosol transmission. However, due to a large number of patients beyond Wuhan's urban medical allocation, the supply of medical protective materials is seriously insufficient, which leads to the continuous occurrence of nosocomial infections [17] . In fact, a large number of healthcare worker infected in a short period easily increase the work pressure and psychological pressures on other healthcare worker. Therefore, it is very important to identify the risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection of healthcare worker, and develop a standard protocol for the diagnosis and treatment.",

In our study, 100% (169/169) of the patients underwent establishment of venous-access channels, of which 28.40% (48/169) simultaneously received a central venous catheter. At this time, burn patients could not have been quickly screened for COVID-19 infection. When performing a peripheral or a central venipuncture to establish a fluid replacement channel, healthcare worker need J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to have close contact with the patient. In fact, close contact is one of the main routes of transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, the process of establishing venous access channels is the earliest point of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the early treatment of burn patients.4.1.2. Endotracheal intubation or tracheotomyPatients with extensive burns are prone to systemic edema, and neck edema causes narrowing of the trachea. When combined with respiratory burns, the airway mucosa is damaged, and throat edema increases the possibility of asphyxia. Early treatment often requires endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy, and if necessary, ventilator-assisted breathing. In the process of endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy, healthcare worker must have come into contact with the patient's respiratory droplets.However, droplet transmission is the main mode of transmission of COVID-19. After endotracheal intubation or tracheal intubation, sputum aspiration and other related operations are easy routes to contact aerosols. In our study, 18.93% (32/169) of severely burned patients underwent endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy. Because most of the patients with severe burns are treated in the burns ICU, the more difficult tracheotomy is undertaken at the bedside. Compared with the operating conditions and equipment in the operating room, bedside procedures are deficient in terms of safety protocols, and the neck of patients often has tissue edema, which necessitates longer tracheostomy times than in normal procedures. The risk of exposure to infection is thus increased. Therefore, the establishment of endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy is the highest risk-exposure point for COVID-19 infection in the early treatment of burn patients.",

In our study, 100% (169/169) of the patients underwent wound management. Early burn escharectomy and skin grafting are also common operations for burn patients. When general anesthesia with tracheal intubation is needed, medical staff come into contact not only with patients, but also with patients' respiratory droplets and aerosols. In our study, 63.31%% (107/169) patients underwent surgical treatment within 14 days after injury, of which 82.24% (88/107) underwent general anesthesia through tracheal intubation. In the process of wound treatment and operation, healthcare worker would not only operate in a relatively closed environment, but also closely experience contact with the patient's body fluids, droplets, and aerosols. In the process of wound treatment and operation, healthcare worker not only need to operate in a relatively closed environment, but also closely contact with the patient's body fluids. Both intimate contact with patients' body fluids and long-time exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment are routes of transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, the process of wound treatment and surgery is the highest risk point of COVID-19 infection exposure in the early treatment of burn patients.",

Thereafter, strict adherence to emergency protocols for patients withsuspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be enforced. Relevant protective tasks should be carried out during the perioperative period and intraoperatively, and all items and surfaces should be disinfected and sterilized in strict adherence to the disinfection protocol. Patients should be isolated in a single room during hospitalization. During dressing change and ward rounds, attention is needed toward the implementation of a series of protective measures against nosocomial infections. For patients who are not confirmed to be free of COVID-19 infection, emergency procedures such as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f general anesthesia of endotracheal intubation should be undertaken in the negative-pressure operating room, and the healthcare worker need to establish tertiary protective measures (Figure 2). In general, COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease with diverse transmission routes and a high transmission rate. During the epidemic period, the treatment of burns patients not confirmed to be free of COVID-19 infection, the processes of establishing intravenous access, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are risk points of infection exposure. The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and development of practical treatment procedures will increase the protection levels for healthcare worker and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.",
