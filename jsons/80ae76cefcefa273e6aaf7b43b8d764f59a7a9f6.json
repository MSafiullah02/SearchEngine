As 36 of March 31 st , 2020, 857,165 COVID-19 cases were confirmed around the world, and more 37 than 42,100 people have died. The death rate is estimated at 5%, with older adults making up 38 the vast majority of cases (>80%). Not surprisingly, studies show a decline in the number of pedometer steps taken per week by 50 adults due to restrictions put in place to mitigate COVID-19. European countries showed the 51 most dramatic decline, ranging from a 7% to 38% reduction in steps between March 15 to 22, 52 2020. 1 Hence, it is also important to keep in mind that inactivity is the fourth leading cause of 53 mortality according to the World Health Organization 2 . 54 55 Maintaining functional ability and coping with functional limitations for as long as possible are 56 key healthcare challenges for independent living institutionalized and hospitalized older 57 adults. Thus, although COVID-19 restrictions aim to protect older adults, such social and 58 physical distancing is also likely to negatively impact the physical and mental health of older 59",

Older hospitalized patients are often on confined to bed for 17 hours per day 70 According to WHO, healthy aging is largely determined by the ability to maintain both mental 85 and physical capacities 13 . No medications currently exist that help maintain physical capacity, 86 nor will any be commercialized in the foreseeable future. However, physical capacity can be 87 maintained through physical stimulus via adapted physical activity. It is well-known that 88 physical activity is key for the health and well-being of people over age 85 14 . 89 90 Physical activity has been shown to protect against the incidence of activities of daily living 91 disability, but also disability progression or severity 15 Each physical activity color program included 2 specific and adapted exercises (e.g.: seated 156 knee extension; sit to stand; step aside; chair forward bend; bipodal or unipodal static 157 balance; wall squat) and a walking time (Figure 1 ). All programs have been created to 158 improve or at least maintain balance, strength but also mobility and cardio-pulmonary function 159 (aerobic capacities). All program are realized unsupervised, without materials (except room 160 equipment: chair or wall) between 2 to 3 times per day, in seated or standing position. adapted physical activity programs without specific materials and using notebook, TV-screen, 164 video or internet live video can be implement to avoid bed rest and immobilization effects 165 during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g: SPRINT; MATCH Vivifrail; LaterLifeTraining; Go4Life, 166 MOVE etc.; see Table 1 ). In conclusion, to our knowledge, daily simple, adapted and specific physical activities 177 including strength, balance and walk exercises (see figure 1 & 2 or vivifrail\u00a9) should be 178 considered as the best solution to care for frail older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. 179 ",

A meta-analysis in hospitalized older 92 adults concluded that only supervised physical interventions, including those in continuous 93 adaptation to the patient's capabilities, showed positive results on the patient's physical 94 performance 16 ]. Nevertheless, the solution to this problem requires pragmatism and an 95 ecological approach, as healthcare resources are limited and made available by priority basis. previous research showed that Jintronix\u00a9 an interactive exergames program is feasible, 100 acceptable and improves functional capacities, including walking speed, in older adults in 101 long-term cares or post-hospitalization 18 . Interestingly, Barbosa Neves et al. observed that the 102 use of technology increased also perceived social interaction with family and friends in 103 participants with geographically distant relatives 19 . Thus technology can be used to avoid 104 physical decline, as well as decrease isolation and loneliness. Overall, exergames using: 1) 105 video consoles (e.g.: Wii, Wii-Fit, Xbox or PlayStation fitness games); 2) interactive 106 rehabilitation technologies (e.g.: Jintronix\u00a9 software); 3) Tablet or Smartphone (e.g.: Vivifrail 107 application); 4) wearable sensor-based (e.g.: FallSensing Exergames: OTAGO) or; 4) virtual 108 reality (e.g.: Box, Rendever, Sea Hero Quest using Oculus Go, HTC Vive; Samsung Gear) ) 109 should be brought forward to alleviate some of the challenges caused by COVID-19 110 restrictions, namely physical distancing and isolation. Nevertheless, many components of this 111 technology (internet or materials or licenses access) are not yet available at hospital or long-112 term care. Thus, other solutions need to be find. 113 114 DVD delivered physical activity intervention (e.g FlextoBa; OTAGO) is another efficient 115 method to improve physical performance (flexibility, strength) or functional capacities (SPPB; 116 balance) in older adults since this technology can be used unsupervised and without 117 individual internet access. For example, Wojcicki et al. concluded that physical activity 118 program using DVD (no internet need), specifically designed to target functional fitness in 119 sedentary older adults, can produce clinically meaningful gains in physical function that are 120 maintained beyond intervention cessation 20 . Nevertheless, this method requests individuals 121 DVD disc and DVD reader. In addition, those scientifically validated are not all adapted to frail 122 population such as older adults living in long-term care or hospitalized. 123 Recently, Ortiz-Alonso et al. showed that simple supervised exercises (walking and rising 124 from a chair for \u223c20 minutes/day) decreased hospitalization-associated disability in very old 125 hospitalized patients 21 . However, even if this study demonstrated that simple exercises can 126 improved functional capacities, this intervention has been done with supervision and can't be 127 replicated during covid-19. 128 specific physical activity programs are efficient and safe (no fall reported) to improve 132 functional capacity in older adults post-hospitalization 22 (Figure 1). But compared to previous 133 studies, the novelty that facilitate its implantation is that the 27 specific programs are 134 prescribe based on a pragmatic decisional tree 22 . 135 136 In addition, a pilot study tested unsupervised simple exercises in hospitalized older adults and 137 demonstrated that it was not only feasible and acceptable 23 but also an efficient way to 138 improve a patient's functional capacity and physical activity practice (length of stay and 139 discharge orientation) 24 . 140 This simple physical activity program has been recently improved to be easily and 141 automatically prescribe using a pragmatic decisional tree (adapted from Carvalho et al. 22 ) 24 , 142 and; by adjusting simple unsupervised adapted physical activity programs (5 colors levels) 143 according to patient and clinician feedbacks 24 . This new physical activity program (MATCH: 144 Maintenance of Autonomy Through exercise Care during Hospitalization) available in 145 notebook with optional and additional training video is already tested and implemented during 146 the covid-19 to geriatric hospital unit and long-term care with no individual internet access. 147 Regarding this program, the healthcare teams need first to complete the decisional tree . This 148 decisional tree includes 3 simple tests: 1) 30-sec chair test (numbers and used of arms); 2) 149 SPPB balance (side by side & semi-tandem) tests (yes or no) and 3) SPPB 4-m walking 150 speed 22;24 . These 3 tests have been chosen as there are already implemented in geriatric 151 practice, easy to do (space and time) and do not request any specific materials. The score 152 obtained using the 2 first tests prescribe the adapted and specific color physical activity 153 program 22;24 . The third test (walking speed) determined the walking time since the corridors, 154 common or free-spaces are very different in each structure 24 . 155",
