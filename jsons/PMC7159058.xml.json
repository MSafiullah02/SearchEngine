In another related study in 2016, Majumder et al [15] used HealthMap surveillance data and Google Trends to predict cases of Zika virus in Colombia [15] and showed that digital surveillance data could be useful for the prediction of Zika cases. Further, in 2017, Teng et al [16] proposed a prediction model for Zika virus using search data from Google Trends and built the model using an autoregressive integrated moving average. They found a strong correlation between Zika-related searches and Zika cases. For the incidence prediction of influenza, socioenvironmental factors were considered when developing an epidemiological model named Susceptible Exposed to Infectious Recovered (SEIR) [17]. The model supports decision makers to factor the mass media and climate factors into the classical epidemic models. Another study emphasized the importance of environmental factors for the development of an influenza prediction model [18]. The findings of these studies along with our study show that internet resources could be helpful in pandemic forecasting.",

It is worth mentioning that we used some of the keywords related to COVID-19 for extracting Google search frequencies; the selected keywords may have been incomplete and further research could aim to identify the most relevant set of keywords. In addition, future research should combine other data sources such as social media information, people\u2019s contacts with the special call center for COVID-19, mass media, environmental and climate factors, and screening registries.
