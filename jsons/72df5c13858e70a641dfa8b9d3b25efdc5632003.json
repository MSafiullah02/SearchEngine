This study aimed to use the metagenomic sequencing approach to characterize the viral diversity in respiratory samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. We have investigated 86 respiratory samples received from various hospitals in Kuwait between 2015 and 2016 for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. A metagenomic approach using the next-generation sequencer to characterize viruses was used. According to the metagenomic analysis, an average of 145, 019 reads were identified, and 2% of these reads were of viral origin. Also, metagenomic analysis of the viral sequences revealed many known respiratory viruses, which were detected in 30.2% of the clinical samples. Also, sequences of nonrespiratory viruses were detected in 14% of the clinical samples, while sequences of non-human viruses were detected in 55.8% of the clinical samples. The average genome coverage of the viruses was 12% with the highest genome coverage of 99.2% for respiratory syncytial virus, and the lowest was 1% for torque teno midi virus 2. Our results showed 47.7% agreement between multiplex Real-Time PCR and metagenomics sequencing in the detection of respiratory viruses in the clinical samples.",

            "text": "However, it is often difficult to standardize the assay by using various primers. Hence, novel approaches that overcome the difficulties of viral detection with the conventional molecular methods are needed to discover novel human viruses. 13 Not surprisingly, virologists were the first to explore the use of sequence-independent, a metagenomic approach using Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) to detect humanassociated viruses. The genome of DNA and RNA viruses can be detected directly after extraction from samples through metagenomic sequencing. 14 Worldwide, respiratory tract infection (RTI) is an important cause of hospitalization among young children and elderly, with significantly high mortality and morbidity. 15 RTI is a group of diseases of both upper or lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include laryngitis, common cold, rhinitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, otitis media and rhinosinusitis/sinusitis. On the other hand, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) include bronchitis, bronchiolitis, tracheitis and pneumonia. These respiratory tract infections increase the extent of the problem in patients with chronic comorbidities and asthma, 16 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 17 very young, elderly, 17 and immunocompromized patients. Respiratory viruses account for over 65% of all respiratory infections and 90% of URTIs. 18, 19 Bacteria, however, only represent 10% of all URTIs. 19 Despite the improvement in the molecular techniques for viral discovery, the viral aetiology of RTI is still unknown in a high number of cases either because the tests are ineffective or the virus is unrelated to any of the currently known respiratory viruses. Current diagnostic methods to detect respiratory viruses are mainly based on sequence-dependent molecular amplification techniques such as PCR, which identify a panel of known viruses, and therefore, new respiratory viruses are missed. To overcome the pitfalls associated with PCR approaches based on NGS techniques such as viral metagenomic will become a logical step as routine viral diagnostics on clinical samples. Broaden not only the detection range of viruses but also provide an additional characterization of the detected viruses such as genotypes and subtypes of viruses. However, the efficiency and viability of using such techniques in diagnostic setting require further study.",

The results presented in this study demonstrated that metagenomic approach is a promising diagnostic tool in clinical virology in which RT-Real-Time PCR couldn't detect many respiratory viruses that were detected by metagenomic approaches. Such sequence independent detection method will increase the chance to detect the causative agent of viral RTI and to gain information of the viruses that cannot be obtained by the current diagnostic tool. Although many obstacles to the routine use of metagenomic approaches do exist, which include cost, labor intensity and turnover time, it was proved to be highly sensitive in many studies,",

The question is probably when metagenomics sequencing will become a routine test for detecting infectious viruses? This approach requires improvement in sample preparation, validated pipelines for read sorting and taxonomic assignation and soon will substitute the current diagnostic tools. Indeed, this novel study provided outstanding information on the association of different viruses with RTIs in Kuwait.",

High-quality paired-end sequences were retained for downstream analysis. Host and bacterial sequences were removed from these sequences by mapping them to a database containing all human and bacterial DNA/RNA sequences. A database of references containing about 5800 strains available on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was created by merging all sequence into one FASTA file. The host removed reads were aligned against a viral reference using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and sam files were created. Option samtools flagstat provided the percentage of host and viral reads in sam files. A statistic summary providing the information regarding some reads corresponding to the individual viral strain and the percentage of viral genome covered for all viruses was extracted from sam files using pileup option in bb map program (http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-userguide/bbmap-guide/).",

The two-tailed probability value \"p\" <0.05 was considered statistically significant.3 | RESULTS3.1 | Virus detection by multiplex real-time PCREighty-six respiratory samples from patients with URTIs and LRTIs who visited different hospitals in Kuwait between 2015 and 2016 were analyzed for respiratory viruses by multiplex Real-Time PCR assay. The results showed that 65 out of 86 samples (75.6%) were positive for respiratory viruses. Among the positive samples, 23 (35.4%) were positive for RSV, 12 (18.5%) samples were positive for HRV, eight (12.3%) samples were positive for influenza A, four (6.2%) samples were positive for AdV, four (6.2%) samples were positive for HMPV, two (3%) samples were positive for bocavirus, two (3%) samples were positive for enterovirus, one (1.5%) sample was positive for influenza B, one (1.5%) sample was positive for PIV, one (1.5%) sample was positive for HCoV-OC43, and seven (10.7%) samples were positive for dual viruses (Figure 1). The combinations of dual virus samples were as follow: adenovirus and human bocavirus; human bocavirus and influenza A virus; RSV and AdV; AdV and PIV-A virus; RSV and PIV-3; HRV and HMPV; RSV and influenza B virus. The remaining 21 (24.4%) samples were negative for any respiratory viruses (Figure 1).",

Analysis of the sequencing reads revealed that over half of the reads (64%) were host-derived reads, however, only 2% of the reads derived from viruses. The residual of the reads (34%) included bacterial reads and other reads that did not have any significant match in the database. Other researchers have also reported high percentage (90%) of human-derived sequence in nasal specimens analyzed by metagenomics sequencing.[31][32][33] Therefore, it appears that the presence of human-derived reads is an intrinsic problem when nucleic acids are extracted directly from respiratory samples.

The patients were admitted to different hospitals in Kuwait including Al-Sabah Hospital, Al-Farwaniya Hospital, Al-Adan Hospital, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital, Infectious Diseases Hospital, and Al-Amiri Hospital. The respiratory diseases of the patients were pharyngitis/tonsillitis, rhinitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. The patients ranged in age from one day to 89 years, with a median age of two years. Summary of clinical samples is shown in Table 1. The respiratory samples included nasopharyngeal aspirates/wash, nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirates, sputum, throat swabs, and nasal swabs. They were collected in the hospital and processed at the Virology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University for the presence of viral nucleic acids using multiplex Real-Time PCR and metagenomic analysis based on next-generation sequencing.2.2 | Nucleic acids extraction and multiplex real-time PCR assayTotal nucleic acids were isolated from clinical samples using Roche\u00aeMagNA Pure LC system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further processing. Multiplex Real-Time PCR assay using Fast Track Kit (Fast \u2212Track Diagnostic, Luxembourg, Germany) was used to detect common respiratory viruses from the extracted RNA according to manufacturers' instructions. This assay is Multiplex Real-Time PCR for detection of 21 respiratory viruses by TaqMan\u00ae technology. It required five tube multiplex for detection of influenza A, influenza A (H1N1) swl, influenza B, human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, pararespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, bocavirus, adenovirus (AdV), parechovirus, enterovirus, mycoplasma pneumonia, and internal control.

It should be noted that two nucleic acid extracts for each clinical sample were prepared. The first extract was used to perform RT-PCR and the second extract was used to perform metagenomics sequencing using NGS. This, in turn, will generate differences in nucleic acid concentration and quality which may further affect the results.The analytical sensitivity of metagenomics sequencing is highly influenced by the quality of the samples. To improve the sensitivity of this approach is by increasing the depth of sequencing, which in turn can be overcome by improving the sample preparation.43 One of the solutions is to perform additional steps of ample-filtering before sequencing to eliminate host cells and enhance the microbial genome to ensure more efficient microbial pathogen detection. Some studies employed a pre-treatment step before nucleic acid extraction which required a combination of filtration and density-dependent centrifugation to enhance the majority of viruses.4,44,45 Others used an enzyme cocktail containing DNasI, RNaseI, and benzonase to digest naked host nucleic acid.46 One of the limitations of pre-treatment step to remove host DNA contents from clinical samples is the possibility to introduce a bias and decrease the sensitivity for DNA viruses such as adenovirus which considered as vital virus causing respiratory diseases. Also, filtering steps may reduce significantly the quality of DNA/RNA produced, which may further effect metagenomics sequencing results. Therefore, it is recommended to keep pretreatment steps to a minimum to avoid any particular bias. We have used a virus identification algorithm, BWA and BLAST from NCBI for the identification, clustering and read removal. One noticeable step for future improvement lies in the treatment of the BLAST undefined reads. BLAST search did not classify a large portion of the sequence data generated here. Future efforts will include an emphasis on alternative virus identification to characterize these novel sequences.Massive sequencing projects and databases based on NGS technologies are not safe from contamination issues.47,48 It is problematic when contaminant sequence reads being lost in the numerous of reads from the target sample, and consequently difficult to detect and clean out. In NGS library assembly protocols, it is essential to have one or multiple PCR amplification steps that could elevate the concentrations of DNA, thereby increasing the risk of contamination.Also, cross-contamination of starting material is a devastating issue.There is a chance that samples may contaminate each other when they are prepared at the same time, or multiple libraries are produced in parallel. To avoid this type of contamination is to perform all sample and library preparations individually. If it is not feasible to do all sample and library preps separately, then strict measures are needed to be employed to keep samples pure. Certainly, it is essential to identify at which steps of the experimental protocol the contaminations are most often happening, and to deliver guidelines on how to avoid it.",
