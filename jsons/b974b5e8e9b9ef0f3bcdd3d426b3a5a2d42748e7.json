During the 3 years analyzed (1985-19871, a total of 1,993 positive detections of astroviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, and small round structured viruses (SRSVs) were reported. In 1 year of this period, 8,210 rotaviruses were reported. More than 90% of the astroviruses and caliciviruses were detected in children under 5 years of age, while coronaviruses and SRSVs were detected in adults as well as children. Detections of astroviruses increased in the winter and were infrequent during the summer, a seasonal pattern similar to that observed for rotaviruses. There was some variability between reporting regions in rates of detection of fecal viruses. We have attempted to identify the reasons for this. We make suggestions for improving the detection of human fecal viruses, and we recognize the need for continued surveillance of these agents.",

Those implicated include rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, small round featureless viruses (SRVs), small round structured viruses (SRSVs), and coronaviruses. The SRSVs are a morphological group that includes those viruses most frequently associated with outbreaks: the Norwalk virus and other similar viruses [Caul and Appleton, 1982; Kapikian and Chanock, 0 1991 WILEY-LISS, INC. 19901. The routine technique for diagnosing these infections is electron microscopy (EM), but the capital cost and technical difficulties have limited the availability of EM to comparatively few diagnostic laboratories. Alternative tests for two viruses (group A rotaviruses and adenoviruses of types 40 and 41) are now available, but EM remains the only catchall technique at present. Not surprisingly, epidemiologic data on most of these viruses are scanty and no national data have been published hitherto.",

We have analyzed the reports to CDSC, which do not include results from Scotland, for the period 1985-1987, to identify any apparent epidemiological trends. Data on rotaviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, SRSVs, and coronaviruses have been included in the analysis. The compilation of these data, resulting from more than 50,000 EM observations annually, allowed a unique opportunity to examine aspects of the epidemiology of viral agents of gastroenteritis on a large scale. Observations from the U.K. experience have formed the basis for a system about to be introduced in North America [Lew et al., 19901 .

The specimens were stools from sporadic cases of gastrointestinal illness and from commonsource outbreaks. There was no selection by age. The laboratories used a standardized nomenclature based on morphology (Fig. 1) to identify enteric viruses. Small round fecal viruses present particular problems of identification and were classified as astrovirus, calicivirus, or SRSV when compatible morphology was present (Table I ). These viruses were distinguishable from other small round viruses, present in human fecal samples, which lacked identifiable surface morphology and were termed small round featureless viruses (SRVs). The featureless viruses have not been monitored in the U.K. reporting system. The PHLS EM Committee monitored the accuracy of the reports by reviewing micrographs submitted by the laboratories and by offering help and advice when it was sought. The same committee has an advisory role in the annual distribution of coded reference specimens provided by the PHLS as part of a national scheme (NEQAS).",

No attempt was made to allow for severity of illness, asymptomatic excretion, or variations in interest and technique between laboratories.

This may have occurred for several reasons: differences in disease incidence; different research interests; variable commitment to, and facilities for, EM; variable interest and commitment of the clinicians, and the length of the lines of communication. It would therefore be unwise to speculate further. Moreover, it is inappropriate to Caul and Appleton [1982] . aBD, buoyant density in cesium chloride. (1985) (1986) (1987) . Those detections for which a Datient age was unknown are not included. The total number of' compare these data in detail with Grohmann's [19851 proportional detection rates in Australia, in a study conducted by a single laboratory with standardized techniques. While EM remains the \"gold standard' for detecting all fecal viruses, other techniques have recently been shown to detect viruses in EM-negative specimens. A study of diarrhea among children in Arizona day-care centers showed that although 11 of 375 specimens (2.9%) contained calicivirus detectable by ELISA and confirmed by immune electron microscopy (IEM), no particles were observed by direct EM [Matson et al., 19891. Similarly, Grohmann [1985] used IEM to examine 800 specimens that were initially negative by direct EM and detected a virus in 205 cases (25.6%). In particular, of the 300 EM-negative samples from adults (aged 15-59 years), 125 (42%) contained \"Norwalklike\" ke., SRSV) particles detectable by IEM. These results suggest that antibody-enhanced EM methods (IEM) increase sensitivitiy and should be more widely applied, particularly for the examination of outbreaks.",

            "text": "Astrovirus, like rotavirus, occurred more commonly during the winter months, while calicivirus, SRSV, and coronavirus did not exhibit obvious seasonal patterns. A winter increase in astrovirus detections was also observed in the 6-year Australian study [Grohmann, 19851. Whether this pattern is related to serotypic variations in pathogenicity, seasonal differences in host susceptibility, modes of transmission, or some other environmental factors remains to be determined. Astrovirus and calicivirus were found almost exclusively in samples from young children, specifically in those under 1 year of age. This finding is consistent with observations that acquisition of antibodies to these agents occurs in early childhood [Kurtz and Lee, 1978; Grohmann, 1985; Kurtz and Lee, 1987; Nakata et al., 19881 . By contrast, SRSV and coronavirus were frequently found in adults as well as children. In the case of SRSV, the observed age distribution was consistent with these agents being frequently associated with community outbreaks of gastroenteritis among adults [Kapikian et al., 19901. In such outbreaks in the United Kingdom, it is normal that only a small number of samples is examined and, of these, only a small proportion (1040%) is positive [Caul, 19881;  consequently, there will be considerable underreporting. A further problem is that many laboratories do not investigate outbreaks but concentrate on childhood diarrhea. It follows that the age incidence of SRSVs plotted in Figure 3 should not be overinterpreted.",

A more complete understanding of the true incidence of these viruses, particularly in asymptomatic excretion, would require expensive and time-consuming prospective studies. These should include collection of data to define the age-specific incidence of infection, with or without disease, and to establish the common signs and symptoms associated with infection. Progress in enhancing the sensitivity of EM detection of these agents, particularly of SRSVs, depends on the application of immune techniques. The collection of paired serum and stool samples will be essential in establishing standardized protocols for immune-enhanced detection and for the development of new assays. Ultimately, more sensitive diagnostic tests based on immunoassays will be required for the diagnostic clinical laboratories whilst molecular techniques such as hybridization probes or the polymerase chain reaction will be needed as research tools to permit studies on the etiology of gastroenteritis.",
