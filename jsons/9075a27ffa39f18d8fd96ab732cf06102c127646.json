An adult falls ill with acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) 2.5 times a year on average, and children under four, four to five times a year [1] . ARD induced mortality due to sequelae is 1-2%. Children, elderly people, and HIV patients are susceptible to the highest risk of mor bidity and sequelae [2] . Acute respiratory diseases lead to substantial economic loss because of temporary incapacity [3] . In recent years, specialists have largely focused on possible epidemics related to the new flu virus variants (\"bird flu,\" \"swine flu,\" etc.). The importance of the ARD and flu problem is widely acknowledged. However, despite considerable efforts to reduce morbidity, population data do not show a positive decrease in ARD frequency. In the search for the possible causes of the current situation, let us con sider factors that determine the dynamics of ARD morbidity.",

This approach to the suppression of a certain agent is efficient to control smallpox, hepatitides, roseola, and other viral infections. In the case of respi ratory diseases, this task is complicated by the variabil ity of viruses. The picture is distorted even more by the fact that ARDs include more than 200 etiologically independent diseases that are united in one group by three characters: the agent transfer mode (airborne, contact), the localization of the main pathological process (breathing passages), and the clinical charac ter. Some respiratory viruses can stay in latency or keep up an asymptomatic chronic infection. When immunity flags or external conditions change, chronic and latent infections can wake up and cause ARDs. All these infections localize in breathing passages; conse quently, resistance and immunity to them are based on the general local structures and resources of nonspe cific and immune protection. The described facts give reasons to consider all ARDs as a complex of related diseases.",

The probability of conta gion increases in crowded places, like public transpor tation and cultural and educational establishments. Another condition for the development of an epi demic is a large quantity of the population. The point is that a patient radiates viruses for only a few days; then the patient's immune system eliminates the virus and forms immune memory for it. During the infectiv ity period, one patient must infect several people to create the right number of patients after several infec tivity cycles to call it an epidemic. If the population is partitioned, for example, includes several cities, the picture becomes distorted not only because of delays in agent transfer but also because of local differences, for example, in weather. Consequently, it is easier to study the development of an epidemic from the exam ple of one city.",

The ACF for weekly ARD morbidity data looks like an oscillating curve with a period of 52 weeks (Fig. 3) . The smoothness of the curve obtained shows regularity in annual morbidity cycles. It is interesting that the ACF has a local maximum equal to 0.52 with a lag of four years (207 weeks); this value is 15% higher than with a lag of one year and 8.9% higher with a lag of two years. This effect may be related to the fact that immunity to certain agents weakens in four years. The effect increases after deducting the linear dependence of morbidity on air temperature; the correlation value decreases; but the expression of growth increases under a lag divisible by four years. This shows the independence of the four year morbidity cycle from temperature cycles.",

At the same time, it is known that in different seasons res piratory infections are caused by agents with different epidemiological characteristics (the spread rate, the duration of latent and contagious periods, etc.). In addition, in winter the agent propagation process involves the majority of the population, and in sum mer morbidity is 20-30 times lower. Consequently, we may expect that correlation between the morbidity levels of neighboring weeks will differ. Figure 4 shows curves that describe the sequences of correlation coef ficients for the fifth and 22nd weeks. We see that the morbidity level of the 22nd week (end of May) corre lates with the morbidity levels of the following 15th-20th weeks. The morbidity of the fifth week (end of January) has a significant correlation only with the morbidity of the following five weeks. If we plot the dependence of the length of the cor relation period for morbidity levels on the week num ber, the graph will show a characteristic pattern: from week 20 through week 36 (mid May through early September), a monotonous decrease in the length of the correlation period occurs from 22 to four weeks (according to the data with a 95% confidence level) (Fig. 5) . The rest of the graph is characterized by irreg ular fluctuations of the correlation period length from four to eight weeks. Note also a less pronounced fea ture at the end of September (week 38 through week 41) with a correlation period of about 20 weeks. Although the confidence level here is slightly lower, this dependence is interesting because it implies a pos sible relation between morbidity levels at the end of September and during the winter epidemic rise between the end of January and the beginning of Feb ruary the next year. If this relation reflects a functional dependence, it is critical in terms of predicting and controlling the morbidity level during winter epidemi ological rises [2] .",

To exclude them from analysis, we can use the notion of an epidemic threshold (a norm that medical admin istrations determine annually on the basis of the epi demic situation analysis).
