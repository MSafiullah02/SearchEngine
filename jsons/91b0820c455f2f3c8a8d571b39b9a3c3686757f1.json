As we progress through the conditions-based transition, with the riskassessed limitations on AGPs, we will need to support our patients in understanding the rationale behind the alternative management options and in appreciating the benefits of minimally invasive oral care (MIOC). Armed with the MIOC philosophy, with patients fully engaged in the shared decision-making, the opportunity to actively apply MIOC in the post-pandemic era brings us all a step closer to breaking the 'repeat restoration cycle' . 1 The",

With technology being used to minimise footfall into our hospitals, could it be exploited effectively in the oral healthcare sector? Our post-pandemic care model could be complemented with virtual oral healthcare at scale. Limitations in face-to-face care may well be surmounted with innovative augmentation of recall/review periodicity and online video communication services as an intrinsic element of engaging with patients to deliver prevention, reinforcing good oral health habits as patients stabilise ahead of any surgical intervention.",
