Thus, there has been an increasing interest in identifying important prognostic factors for vvECMO. Published work includes two risk scores designed for pre-ECMO mortality prediction in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the ECMOnet score [6] and the PRESERVE score [7]. Presently, it is thought that multi-organ failure and sepsis play a more important role than the patient\u2019s hemodynamic and respiratory state in the acute situation [6,8,9]. However, findings have been inconsistent. Limitations of previous studies include changes in ECMO technology and procedure over time, small study populations, large patient heterogeneity, limited registration of potentially important factors related to outcome, and application of statistical methods which may not take into account the random variability of patients, thus leading to results that have not been reproducible.",

Based on prospectively collected data from an institution where different forms of ECMO are now performed more than 100 times per year, we validated the existing risk scores and compared their predictive ability with the more general Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score frequently used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Furthermore, in accordance with the hypothesis that ECMO outcome is largely dependent on the patient\u2019s extra-pulmonary status and general health condition, our aim was to examine data regarding clinical characteristics, respiratory and laboratory parameters, to develop two novel risk scores: one designed for pre-ECMO mortality prediction and one including parameters measured one day after ECMO implantation. We compared the different pre-ECMO mortality prediction models and investigated whether day 1 parameters could enhance predictive ability.",

SOFA was scored for each patient during data collection and stored in the database. ECMOnet and PRESERVE scores were calculated retrospectively. We found matching definitions for all variables except plateau pressure, which was not registered in our database due to the mode of mechanical ventilation used. Peak inspiratory pressure was used as a substitute. The discriminative abilities of the external risk scores were assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC). Since poor fit may be explained by substantial differences in the study populations, predictors identified by the two scores were recalibrated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The original estimates for the linear predictor variables, on which the additive ECMOnet and PRESERVE scores were based, were compared with the recalibrated coefficients and odds ratios, respectively. Clinical usefulness was evaluated using information from the original studies. For the ECMOnet score, we compared the sensitivity and specificity in our population using the authors\u2019 proposed cut-off score for mortality of >4.5 as well as the estimated optimal cut-off in our population, calculated by the Youden index [10]. For the PRESERVE score, we compared mortality rates across groups of PRESERVE scores as described in the original study. We used a simple prognostic separation index (PSEP) to estimate the ability of the score to separate individuals into prognostic groups and compared the index across the cohorts to evaluate the reproducibility in new patients [11].",

In accordance with previous findings, we found the necessity of high minute ventilation before ECMO to be an important predictor of mortality [9]. A high pre-ECMO serum lactate concentration could indicate tissue hypoxia with subsequent metabolic acidosis and severe organ injury. Parallel to reduced hematocrit described in the ECMOnet study, low pre-ECMO hemoglobin concentrations were associated with an increased mortality risk. Possible causes of pre-ECMO anemia include hospital-acquired anemia, iron deficiency anemia or chronic disease. Preoperative anemia has repeatedly been described as an independent risk factor for increased mortality in cardiac as well as noncardiac surgery [19,20].

The usefulness of a prediction model rather lies in the assistance it may provide for the discrimination between higher- and lower-risk patients in order to help identify potential candidates for ECMO support and give guidance for rational and ethical resource utilization [6,11]. We, therefore, categorized patients into three groups with significantly different probabilities of survival. It may be argued that our defined high-risk group was very small, but we kept this cut-off because of its potential clinical usefulness. Categorization of patients may also be helpful for future external and internal validations in order to compare institutional variations in indications and practice of ECMO.
