            "text": "With the rapidly worldwide spread of Coronavirus disease , it is of great importance to conduct early diagnosis of COVID-19 and predict the time that patients might convert to the severe stage, for designing effective treatment plan and reducing the clinicians' workloads. In this study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict the possible conversion time that the patient would spend to convert to the severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity regularization term to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across the classification task and the regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to predict the disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients' lives. Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with * X. Zhu (seanzhuxf@gmail.com) and B. Song (anicesong@vip.sina.com) contributed equally to this work. 422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all comparison methods. Moreover, our proposed method yields 76.97% of accuracy for predicting the severe cases, 0.524 of the correlation coefficient, and 0.55 days difference for the converted time.",

            "text": "The increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases results in the lack of the clinicians and the increase of the clinicians' workloads. Many laboratory techniques have been used to confirm the suspected COVID-19 cases by clinicians Jung et al. (2020) , including real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Corman et al. (2020) ; Ai et al. (2020) , non-PCR tests (e.g., isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology Craw and Balachandran (2012) ), noncontrast chest computed tomography (CT) and radiographs Lee et al. (2020) , and so on. It is well known that manually detection is time-consuming and increases the infection risk of the clinicians Kong and Agarwal (2020) . Moreover, laboratory tests are usually prohibited for all suspected cases due to the limitation of the test kits Kong and Agarwal (2020) ; Ng et al. (2020) . Also, RT-PCR has been widely used to confirm COVID-19, but easily results in low sensitivity Chaganti et al. (2020) . As a good alternative, artificial intelligence techniques on available data from laboratory tests have been playing important roles on the confirmation and follow-up of COVID-19 cases. For example, Alom et al. employed the inception residual recurrent convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning on X-ray and CT scan images to detect COVID-19 and segment the infected regions of COVID-19 Alom et al. (2020) . Ozkaya et al. first applied CNN to fuse and rank deep features for the early detection of COVID-19, and then used support vector machine (SVM) to conduct binary classification using the obtained deep features Ozkaya et al.

Given the early stage of COVID-19 with minor imaging signs, it is difficult to predict its future progression status. Conventional severity assessment methods can easily distinguish a severe sign of the image from the mild sign, since the changes of CT data are correlated with disease severity, e.g., the lung involvement and abnormalities increase while the symptoms become severe. However, the infected volume of the non-severe COVID-19 cases is usually mild. For example, Guan et al. showed that 84.4% of non-severe patients had mild symptoms and more than 95% severe cases had severe symptoms on CT changes Guan et al. (2020) . On the other hand, the clinicians have few prior knowledge about whether or when the non-severe cases convert to severe cases, so early diagnosis and conversion time prediction could reduce the clinicians' workloads or even save patients' levies.",

Specifically, we employ the logistic regression for the binary classification task and the linear regression for the regression task. Moreover, we employ an \u2113 2,1 -norm regularization term on both the classification coefficient matrix and the regression coefficient matrix to consider the correlation between the two tasks as well as select the useful features for disease diagnosis and conversion time prediction. We further design a novel method to learn the weights of the samples, i.e., automatically learning the weight of each sample so that the important samples have large weights and the unimportant samples have small or even zero weights. Moreover, the samples with zero weights in both the majority class and the minority class are excluded to the process of the construction of the joint classification and regression, thus the problem of imbalance classification can be solved.",

As a result, SFS beats MSFS a little bit, i.e., 1.26% improvement in terms of all evaluation metrics. Second, in Figure 2 , the sensitivities of the methods (e.g., SVM, L1SVM, and MSFS) are low, e.g., 23.86%, 26.73%, and 47.45% respectively.

To do this, we first obtained the totally selected number for each feature across 100 experiments, i.e., repeating the 5-fold cross validation scheme 20 times, and then reported top Tang et al. (2020) . Second, the region number in the right lung is larger than the number in the left lung, i.e., 16 vs. 6. The possible reason is that the virus might easily infect the regions in the right lung Shi et al. (2020b) . Third, we extracted 3 kinds of handcrafted features, i.e., density, mass, and volume, from each part. Moreover, the mass feature is related to both the density feature and the volume feature. Based on the results, our method selected 4 and 7 density features, respectively, from the left lung and the right lung, and 2 and 6 mass features, respectively, from the left lung and the right lung.

However, the task in this paper tried to solve is quite different, as we predict whether the patient would develop severe symptom in the later time. This would result in the problem of imbalance classification since only a small portion of patients would convert severe based on the prevalence rate. First, the problem of imbalance classification of our data set is bias, i.e., 86 severe cases vs. 322 non-severe cases. This makes difficult to construct effective classification models. Second, the difference of infected volumes between the severe cases and the non-severe cases is small, as shown in Figure 4 , while the corresponding difference is distinguished in Tang et al. (2020) , thus the latter can easily conduct classification. With the increase of available the data of severe cases, the accuracy of our method could be further improved. In our future work, we plan to generate new samples for the minority class to lessen the problem of imbalance classification, as well as design new deep transfer learning methods using other data sources (e.g., X-ray data) to solve the issue of small-sized sample and high-dimensional features.",
