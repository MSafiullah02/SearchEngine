The priorities following the peak of infections will follow the usual treatment schedule, considering the risk classes highlighted for urological pediatric patients, while maintaining a state of alert. Moreover, during the emergency period the optimal surgical timepoint will be passed over for some diseases (hypospadias, cryptorchidism) with possible risk for suboptimal outcome or increased social embarrassment and should be prioritized in the waiting list after going through the peak of infections [2] . Furthermore, ordinary radiology service is stopped; intervention as nephrostomy placement should be adopted only for emergency and minimized also for possible domiciliary management problems.",
