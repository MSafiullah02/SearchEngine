            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has created an unprecedented need for breathing assistance devices. Since the demand for commercial, full-featured ventilators is far higher than the supply capacity, many rapid-response ventilators are being developed for invasive mechanical ventilation of patients. Most of these emergency ventilators utilize mechanical squeezing of bag-valve-masks or Ambu-bags. These \"bag squeezer\" designs are bulky and heavy, depends on many moving parts, and difficulty to assemble and use. Also, invasive ventilation requires intensive care unit support, which may be unavailable to a vast majority of patients, especially in developing countries. In this work, we present a low-cost (<$200), portable (fits in an 8\"x8\"x4\" box), non-invasive ventilator (NIV), designed to provide relief to early-stage COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings. We used a high-pressure blower fan for providing noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Our design supports continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) modes. A common concern of using CPAP or BiPAP for treating COVID-19 patients is the aerosolization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used a helmet-based solution that contains the spread of the virus. Our end-to-end solution is compact, low-cost (<$400 including the helmet, viral filters, and a valve), and easy-to-use. Our NIV provides 0-20 cmH2O pressure with flow rates of 60-180 Lmin -1 . We hope that our report will encourage implementations and further studies on helmet-based NIV for treating COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings.",

Initial reports from China suggested approximately 15% of individuals with COVID-19 develop moderate to severe disease and require hospitalization and oxygen support, with a further 5% who require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and supportive therapies including intubation and mechanical ventilation [3] . But mortality rates were found to be high among hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring intubation [4] . On the other hand, early interventions with oxygen therapies and breathing supports have shown to reduce the need for intubation and complications in respiratory failure patients while increasing survival rates [5] . In this scenario, non-invasive ventilation becomes a viable measure for managing COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), early in the disease.",

The control electronics for the NIV incorporate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for control, sensing, and actuation and can operate in either CPAP or BiPAP mode. An Arduino Due microcontroller is at the heart of the system which controls a 12 V DC air blower to deliver pressurized air to the patient helmet. The blower used here is a 50W air pump that can generate a maximum static pressure of 28 cmH 2 O and a maximum flow rate of 240 Lmin -1 at a current draw of 4 A. The blower speed/pressure is controlled by Arduino enabled pulse width modulation (PWM) at 1 kHz and a high power motor driver capable of providing at least 4 A of DC. A 2.8\" touch-screen provides a simple and intuitive user interface to the system, where clinically important parameters such as pressure, inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio, breaths per minute (BPM) can be set and monitored. This touch-screen also comes integrated with a secure digital (SD) card reader, providing the option for data collection during patient treatment. The blower pressure is monitored using a board mount COTS sensor with a -50 kPa to 50 kPa operating range and a sensitivity of 1 kPa\u00b7mV -1 . Additionally, this pressure sensor is also used to detect leaks and tubing disconnects. A board mount differential pressure sensor with a operating range of -6 kPa to 6 kPa is used to measure the compressed air flow rate. An additional function of this differential pressure sensor is in the automatic triggering of inspiration and expiration to enable patient-system synchronization in the BiPAP operating mode. To indicate potential system or user faults such as pressure leaks or accidental tubing disconnections, a magnetic DC buzzer is used to generate an audible alarm. Figure 1c shows a person hooked up to the helmet-based NIV. The filters and the PEEP valve are also shown in the photograph. The entire NIV system is integrated onto a custom printed circuit board (PCB) and housed inside an 8\"x8\"x4\" polyvinyl chloride (PVC) enclosure, as depicted in Figure 2a -c. The touch-screen display and the buzzer are placed on the top of the casing, while Air outlet from the NIV, the oxygen inlet, and the oximeter connection are located on the right-side of the casing. One oxygen cylinder with a flow rate up to 15 Lmin -1 can be connected to the oxygen inlet, while it is possible to connect two oxygen cylinders with a flow rate up to 30 Lmin -1 . A wired custom oximeter can be used with the NIV. On the left-side, universal serial bus (USB) port for programming the Arduino, DC power jack (12 V), and the power switch are located.",

The pressure dropped from 5 to 3 cmH 2 O, which was detectable by the pressure sensor. This drop in pressure is used to trigger the leak alarm.

These sets of experiments provided insight into the pressure and flow settings required for helmet-based NIV. We used CPAP pressure of 5, 7, and 9 cmH 2 O to test the low and medium flow regimes of the NIV ( Figure 5) . The volunteer wore a pulse oximeter for continuous monitoring of pulse oxygenation (SpO 2 ) and heart rate (HR). The PEEP valve was set to 5 cmH 2 O. In the low flow regime, <30 Lmin -1 , helmet-based ventilation is uncomfortable as indicated by the volunteer -rated 5 on a 0-10 comfort scale (Figure 5b) . We also observed fogging of the helmet, which indicated inadequate flow. The pulse oximeter was used to monitor the SpO 2 level of the volunteer. SpO 2 went down slightly from 99% to 97% during the 7 min of testing. Then, low to moderate pressure settings of 7 and 9 cmH 2 O were used. The volunteer reported much higher comfort levels (Figure 5c-e) . Also, we did not observe fogging of the helmet during the tests, which is a potential indicator for CO 2 re-breathing and insufficient flow. SpO 2 levels fluctuated between 99% and 97%, without any evident trend. These experiments verify that a minimum flow of 60Lmin -1 is required for helmet-based ventilation.",

With growing evidence that noninvasive positive pressure ventilation results in a significant reduction in endotracheal intubation [14] , it is a promising low-resource treatment plan for treating COVID-19 patients in developing countries. To facilitate this treatment approach, we presented an end-to-end, low-cost, helmet-based ventilator. Our device moves away from the bulky, heavy, difficulty to assemble and use bag-squeezer-ventilators by using a compact design that is portable and easy-to-use. Also, we mitigate the aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 with a helmet-based approach. We hope we presented a compelling case for our NIV for use in medium to low-tomedium income countries. Nonetheless, further studies and randomized clinical trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and the benefits of helmet-based NIV in treating COVID-19.",
