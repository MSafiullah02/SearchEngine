In reality, one might anticipate that in only a small minority of instances will a sufficient number of civil society actors in multiple locations respond to modern risks as anticipated by reflexive modernization proponents. Reflexive modernization demands first and foremost discursive attention to the nature of crisis\u2014its causes, avenues for amelioration, and at a deeper level, whether the risk issue is in fact a \u201ccrisis.\u201d Given that social understandings of both risk and safety are constructed and evolve through discursive negotiation, several agents may serve to facilitate or hinder the potential for reflexive modernization simply by influencing this discursive process, described by Beck (1995, 1997) as the \u201crelations of definition.\u201d This is particularly the case for invisible risks, such as BSE, that can only be made \u201cvisible\u201d when socially defined. In these instances, the role of the mass media is central to definitional struggles regarding crisis (Cottle 1998; Short 1984). While media actors do not directly control public discourse, their accounts have long been recognized as a primary source of raw material for such discourse (Gans 1979; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1944; Tuchman 1978). \u201cNews stories not only lend occurrences their existence as public events, but also impart character to them, for news reports help to shape the public definition of happenings by selectively attributing to them specific details or \u2018particulars\u2019\u201d (Tuchman 1978:190).",

Media actors do not simply inject content onto a cognitively vacuous audience; however, the process of discursive uptake and processing is a complex, dialectical affair. The individual recipients of mass media themselves filter information through preexisting and enduring schemes of interpretation, which serve to reject or embrace a given media frame. Media frames must thus resonate at some level with the reader for there to be attitudinal uptake, a constraint of which professional media actors are acutely aware (Goffman 1974).",

As the central filter through which risk discourse flows, mass media plays a crucial role in \u201cprocesses of risk revelation, the social contestation that surrounds scientific knowledge of risks, and also processes of social challenge to \u2018risk society\u2019\u201d (Cottle 1998:5\u20136). Mass media comes to serve not only as the modern\u2010day town crier (Park, Burgess, and McKenzie 1967), but the guard in the watchtower as well. As such, it represents an \u201camplification station,\u201d which serves to amplify or attenuate public reactions to risk by filtering and decoding risk event signals, and attaching social values to such information (Kasperson et al. 1988).",

Media is a consumer product, after all (Tuchman 1978), and the construction of newsworthy events can contribute to the amplification or attenuation of risk concern purely as an outcome of media actors' strategic efforts to maximize readership. Strategies to maximize readership, furthermore, may be interpreted differently by different media institutions, as expectations regarding professionalism, resources, and audience characteristics can all vary. While one media agent may attempt to maximize readership with stories designed to shock and awe, another may do so by selecting content designed to reassure. Variations in media institutions and their audiences may help to explain the means by which responses to Beck's \u201ccivilization of threat\u201d are locally and culturally contingent (Cottle 1998).",

Once media has established a particular framing of an issue, policymakers have limited ability to introduce alternatives (Linsky 1986; Schon and Rein 1994), narrowing prospects for institutional reform. A focus on the role of media in risk conflicts \u201cmakes it possible to relate the specifics of the policy process to questions about the rise and fall of public issues and about the wider interests involved in and affected by policy making\u201d (Miller 1999:1241).",

According to Dornbusch (1998), the British media shaped BSE perception by serving as both \u201cinformation disseminator\u201d and \u201crisk assessor.\u201d The British BSE issue was defined in expert and policy discourse as an animal health problem (Miller 1999), but despite the various attempts by key actors to control the media, the British mass media was able to preserve a certain degree of freedom and redefined BSE in terms of food safety (Bauer et al. 2007). News stories evolved over time, reframing BSE from a health crisis into a story of national identity (Brookes 1999). Media actors emphasized the conflicting scientific theories used to explain the BSE\u2010vCJD link, and encouraged readers to question expert discourses, contributing to the disintegration of public trust in science (Mythen 2004). Mass media also highlighted policy failures, extending public skepticism (Miller 1999). Ultimately, the media were blamed for a drop in meat consumption in Britain of 40 percent from pre\u2010BSE levels by 1996 (Linsky 1986; Miller 1999).",

Editorial use of \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d to refer to readers and media agents collectively, while using \u201cthey\u201d to refer to government officials\u2014who insisted that British beef was safe, served to heighten negative feelings and distrust toward government.",

The role of the print media in rural communities is also unique, for a very different set of reasons. The relationship between media institution and audience for a rural news agent differs markedly from the U.K. context, or from virtually any urban regional context, for that matter. First, because the journalist faces a comparatively homogenous audience characterized by distinct boundaries between local and nonlocal entities (Hindman 1996), the motive of the journalist is not necessarily to attract new readers, but rather to maintain the support of the current readership by avoiding offense toward the local cultural milieu. On the other hand, the audience itself could be seen as \u201ccaptive\u201d in certain respects, suggesting a relationship of mutual reinforcement between media and readership. Local newspapers might well be considered an important symbol of local community identity, toward which community members turn out of loyalty to their community, rather than strictly out of preference among multiple choices of media outlet.",

In comparison with other print media, newspapers in rural communities act to reproduce local culture and identity, and facilitate social, bureaucratic, market, and communal processes in ways that nonlocal media do not. Local media has a unique ability to reflect local cultures and needs and promote community integration, despite the emergence of new communications technologies (Bell 2005). Local journalists contribute to community solidarity by selecting content that depicts differences or conflicts between the community and outside groups, and downplaying conflicts within the community (Hindman 1996).",

Given the incentive to resonate with the predilections of a relatively homogenous readership, rural journalists may be far more disposed to select content and frame news stories in a manner that is designed to maintain stability and build consensus (Kim et al. 2002). Rural news agents are less likely to challenge their readers by introducing uncertainty, or disrupting the local power structure for fear of potential sanction (Donohue, Olien, and Tichenor 1989; Donohue, Tichenor, and Olien 1995). The fact that local journalists are themselves members of local communities, and thus identify on a personal level with local culture serves as further reinforcement. According to Crawley (2007:320) \u201cin these situations, journalists often face one dominant, preferred meaning shared by both the community power structure and its media organizations.\u201d",

            "text": "One means of forecasting whether a local newspaper might facilitate or hinder prospects for reflexive modernization among its rural readership might be the extent to which a given risk issue can be interpreted as threatening to local cultural identity. For some risk issues, the relationship between risk and identity is not clear\u2010cut. In a study of local coverage of biotechnology in two agricultural regions, Crawley (2007) found local (although urban) papers were more complex and expressive of a wider diversity of views than national papers. Such a diversity of views has been similarly identified within the agricultural sector itself, as has been the case in regard to genetically modified wheat in Canada (Magnan 2007). This finding may reflect a lack of consensus among farmers regarding biotechnology, with some agricultural producers readily adopting biotechnology, and others expressing greater caution. BSE, on the other hand, could be seen as a clear and direct threat to farming identity, against which agricultural producers might well react in unison. Farmers see themselves as playing a fundamental role in society by providing an essential human need\u2014food. To be faced with the possibility that what is being produced is not an essential human need but rather a serious health threat would be a hard pill to swallow indeed, and liable to be acknowledged only with the greatest hesitancy. The high likelihood for such cultural consensus describes the latter of two communicative amplification stations mentioned above\u2014informal personal networks\u2014which \u201cprovide reference points for validating perceptions but are also likely to share a more general cultural view or bias\u201d (Kasperson et al. 1988:185).",

            "text": "In this study, we analyzed content of local newspapers between May 2003 and April 2006 in two rural, beef\u2010producing regions in the Province of Alberta: the Peace Municipal District (MD) and Barrhead County. Newspapers from Barrhead County include the locally owned Barrhead Leader and a supplemental weekly produced by the same news organization, Town and Country, which is also distributed to several other rural communities in Alberta. The third is from Peace MD, the Peace River Gazette, run by a parent media corporation, Sun Media. Although stories about BSE occurred far more frequently in the Barrhead papers, the results for each region in terms of content are strikingly similar, so we treat this as a single case study representing beef\u2010producing regions in Alberta. A total of 400 articles on BSE were identified, from which we selected for further analysis a representative sample of 35 percent from the first six\u2010month period (May\u2013October 2003), and 20 percent of the remaining time period. The final sample consisted of 10 articles from the Peace River Record Gazette; 17 from the Barrhead Leader; and 73 from Town and Country, for a total of 100 articles (the latter paper being a larger paper and the source of the majority of news on BSE). Of these, eight were editorial or opinion articles, and the remainder were news articles. Articles were categorized according to: (1) definition of crisis; (2) experts cited; (3) expressions of local cohesion/division; (4) attribution of blame; (5) risk acceptance/denial; and (6) prescriptions for response. A reader interreliability test among the two primary researchers produced a 99 percent result.",

After the first reported case in Alberta, then\u2010Minister of Alberta's Agriculture, Food and Rural Development proposed that Alberta work with Ottawa to meet a national goal of testing 65,000 head of cattle every year. As of 2007, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (2008) had not reached this goal, having tested just over 58,000 cattle. Given that, at the time of the outbreak, over 2 million cattle were slaughtered in Canada annually, even the not\u2010yet\u2010attained goal of 65,000 tests represents a testing rate of .03 (Japan, by contrast, admittedly with a much smaller beef industry, tests every slaughtered head of cattle).

If reflexive modernization were to occur, the dominant discourse would necessarily be about how to prevent additional cases of BSE, and further, how to recreate a food production system that is safe for humans, animals, and environment. The absence of such discussions in the local newspapers of these rural, beef\u2010producing regions is not sufficient to conclude that no such reflexivity is present in the beef industry in Canada, or even in beef\u2010producing communities in Alberta. But it does serve as a key indicator of constraint. Local newspapers in places like Barrhead and Peace River enjoy a prominent position in those discursive fields in which beef producers and their families and friends are located, and the likelihood is slim for reflexive transformation of agriculture without the engagement of these crucial actors. Of course, many reflexive modernizationists point to emerging information technologies, such as the World Wide Web, as primary sites for the fostering of \u201csubpolitics\u201d (Bentivegna 2006), which may call into question the continued relevance of the print media as a dominant discursive venue. While digital communications technologies certainly give voice to many corners of civil society, two counter\u2010points are worthy of mention here. First, the blogs, chat rooms, and related communication outlets tend to cater to the expression of particular views, and attract readers who must actively seek such content. Regional print media, by contrast continues to enjoy a \u201ccaptive audience\u201d of sorts, and access to this communication outlet tends to be reserved for the privileged (van Dijk 1993), all of which amounts to a dominant place in political discourse. Second, while internet use in rural communities is growing, it remains well below rates exhibited in urban regions\u2014according to the 2006 Census 58 percent of rural residents in Canada accessed the World Wide Web, compared with over 70 percent of urban Canadians (Statistics Canada 2006)\u2014and consequently the dominant position enjoyed by print media is only further elevated in these domains.",

Having said this, the large economic role played by beef in Alberta was quite possibly a factor in the resistance of local media to a more critical discourse. Canada is the third largest beef producer in the world, and nearly half of the national herd of 13.5 million is located in Alberta. Estimates of the cost of the export quarantines on Canadian beef have been pegged at approximately $2.5 billion for 2003 (Mitura and Di Pietro 2004). The very advantage of large\u2010scale intensive livestock operations is of course cost efficiency, so consideration of alternative models would certainly have economic implications. Testing of cattle for BSE, which must be conducted after slaughter, implies a significant commitment of public revenues. On the other hand, rigorous testing as well as alternative agricultural models are used elsewhere across the globe, suggesting the economic viability of doing so.",

While one should not overstate the degree of ideological consensus in rural communities, by all accounts Peace River and Barrhead are relatively stable, homogenous communities steeped in Alberta's ranching history. Both communities were settled around the turn of the twentieth century as agricultural communities, and despite the rapid capitalization of agriculture since that time, in many respects little has changed. As is typical of many rural agricultural communities in Canada, according to the 2006 Census, 76 percent of residents in both Peace MD and in Barrhead County lived at the same address five years prior (the equivalent Provincial figure is 52 percent). The local populations of both regions are completely devoid of people of color, have lower percentages of residents with university degrees, and higher percentages of married couples, than the Province as a whole. More to the point, even if there does exist a degree of local contention regarding the need for reflexive changes in the beef industry, the lack of representation of such alternative views in local print media would very likely have aided in the marginalization of those views. That said, researchers should not presume that community responses to agricultural risks to be uniform, but rather contingent on particular cultural and historical contexts. Indeed, one recent study of intensive hog farming operations highlighted the heated community\u2010level conflicts that such operations can generate (Novek 2003). Unlike cattle ranching in Alberta, which enjoys a lengthy history and cultural niche, intensive hog farms are a recent incursion in many communities, and this may well contribute to the differences in response.",

This is by no means a one\u2010way process, however. Rural communities also appear to express a much greater loyalty to their local newspaper, possibly as a symbol of community identity. The Barrhead Leader/Town and Country has a weekly circulation of 3,919 (ComBase 2005), in a County with a total of 2,090 households as of the 2006 Census. Similarly, the Peace River Gazette has a weekly circulation of 2,638 (ComBase 2005), serving just 515 households in the Peace MD. By contrast, the Edmonton Journal, which serves the Edmonton metropolitan area with over 405,000 households, has a seven\u2010day weekly average circulation of just 145,000 (Edmonton Journal n.d.), with many of these being delivered outside the Edmonton region. Further research on newsprint readership in Alberta found 77 percent of an interview sample of 10,000 indicating they read the last issue of their local community paper, whereas only 40 percent indicated they read either of the Province's urban dailies or national daily papers (ComBase 2006).",

Far less evidence has emerged of critical reflection of the modern agricultural industry in Canada. While this case study is by no means conclusive, it raises the question as to whether media framing of regional BSE events played a part.
