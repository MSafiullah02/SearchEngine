It has been speculated that the tetravirus capsid might have evolved from a nodavirus-like ancestor through a process that included insertion of an immunoglobulin-like protein domain coding sequence (either acquired or evolved through sequence duplication) within the CP gene. This hypothesis is supported by structural studies that show that the PrV and N\u03c9V capsids are structurally conserved with respect to their jelly-roll folds and Ig-like domains, but not with respect to the structure and function of their N and C-termini. These domains, which form the molecular switch determining the T=4 architecture of PrV capsid, are closely related to those of nodaviruses that possess a T=3 capsid architecture.",

The replicases of TaV and EeV lack both nmT and HEL1 domains. Furthermore, their pRdRp domain has a unique C-A-B motif arrangement in the palm subdomain of the active site that differs from the canonical A-B-C arrangement found in the other tetraviruses, all \u201calphavirus-like\u201d viruses and indeed almost all known template-dependent polynucleotide polymerases (viral and cellular) carrying the palm sub-domain. Interestingly, the same C-A-B permutation of the three motifs is also found in replicases of all dsRNA birnaviruses. This rearrangement is a result of migration of about 22 aa residues encompassing motif C between two internal positions, separated by about 110 aa, in a conserved region of about 400 aa. The permuted TaV, EeV and birnavirus enzymes form a minor, deeply separated cluster in the RdRp tree that also includes viruses of the \u201cpicornavirus-like supercluster\u201d and the order Nidovirales. The pRdRp domains of these viruses are also flanked by the uniquely conserved VPg signal and another poorly characterized domain from the N-terminus. A similar arrangement is also found in DAV.
