The main transmission routes are through respiratory droplets Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and close contact; transmission is also possible when individuals are exposed to high concentrations of aerosols in a sealed environment, while faecal-oral transmission remains to be confirmed [2] [3] [4] . The clinical signs of infection include lower respiratory tract disease accompanied by fever, dry cough, and dyspnoea. A positive test for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is required for definitive diagnosis [5] . However, while the specificity of nucleic acid testing is high, the sensitivity is relatively low and there is an appreciable false negative rate. Diagnosis with chest computed tomography (CT) is more intuitive and faster; chest CT is therefore the main method used for screening and diagnosis [6, 7] . CT scans play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of lung disease. Based on our experience, the imaging findings in COVID-19 infection are diverse and range from a normal appearance to diffuse pulmonary changes. In this study, we retrospectively analysed CT imaging data from 95 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital in order to examine the CT characteristics of infection.",

            "text": "The typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fever, fatigue, and dry cough; this presentation is consistent with lower respiratory tract infection. Nasal congestion, runny nose, and other upper respiratory tract symptoms are rare. Dyspnoea may occur one week after disease onset, and severely affected patients rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation Among the 95 COVID-19 patients in this study, ground-glass opacities (43.1%) were mostly seen in the early stage imaging presentation and lesions were mainly located at the subpleural region in the lung periphery; this distribution may be due to the fact that virus particles fuse with the alveolar epithelium when they reach the cortical lobules in the lower lungs. This causes injury to the alveolar walls, vascular congestion, the accumulation of exudate in the alveoli, swelling around the lobule, and the simultaneous involvement of multiple adjacent lobules. In the early stage of disease, this mainly presents as interstitial ground-glass opacities. At later stages of disease, the lobules fuse, resulting in an irregular morphology and distribution of lesions that does not follow lung segments, and a fan-like distribution of lesions in subpleural areas [11, 12] . In the progression stage, expansion of the lesion area is typically seen, with frequent involvement of multiple lung segments and lobes (21/34, Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 61.8\uff05). Some patients may present with ground-glass opacities in combination with consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows (30.5%). This is mainly due to the collapse of alveolar walls, and the replacement of air in the alveoli with Inflammatory exudate, cells, or tissue. The loss of air contrast causes the walls of pulmonary blood vessels and the trachea to become blurry; this often results from interstitial inflammatory thickening [13] . During the progression stage, air bronchograms or vascular thickening can be seen in consolidated areas. The increase in permeability that underlies these changes may be due to pathogen invasion of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, which results in inflammatory cell infiltration and thickening and swelling of the tracheal walls; however, this does not lead to bronchiolar obstruction.",

In early stage patients, the long axis of these lesions was typically vertical to the thoracic wall and parallel to the bronchovascular bundle (3/53, 5.7\uff05) while some patients in the progression stage showed interstitial thickening (6/34, 17.6\uff05). Adjacent tracheal and bronchial walls did not show significant thickening in early stage patients, while adjacent pleural oedema sometimes developed. At the progression stage, local interstitial thickening gradually became apparent. Some of the patients in this study had pleural thickening (5.3\uff05) while both of the severe stage patients showed mild pleural effusion; this may have been due to pleural inflammation resulting in inflammatory exudates. Only one patient (1.1%) had mediastinal lymph node enlargement due to other comorbidities.In this study, in 5.3% of mild cases, the first CT scan was negative and re-examination 2-7 days later showed abnormalities. The initial scans can be negative because the located in the upper respiratory tract during the early stage and does not cause pulmonary infiltration and exudative lesions[14]. Some mild cases progress to moderate disease; imaging in these cases typically reveals multiple lesions in the lung periphery or subpleural areas (56/71, 78.9\uff05). Lesions are mostly seen in the lower lungs and multiple lesions are often seen bilaterally (45/71, 63.4\uff05), These cases typically have a similar ground-glass opacity presentation to cases in the progression stage, but the lesions do not usually involve the entire lung segment. Patients with a severe clinical presentation (23.2%) presented with diffuse bilateral lung consolidation, air bronchograms and bronchiectasis, and patchy ground-glass opacities visible in non-consolidated regions. In critical patients (2.1%), the -white lung\u2016 presentation was seen on imaging and the lesion area was extensive. By combining the imaging and clinical data in our study, we found that the progression of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients often does not closely correspond to the disease stage seen on imaging; this may partially be due to differences in patients' immune status that affect their response at different stages of the disease. Another reason for this discrepancy could be that the history provided by patients regarding the onset of symptoms is not always accurate[15][16][17][18][19][20].COVID-19 disease can present with a diverse range of imaging findings; a combination of epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data, as well as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results, are required to differentiate it from other viral pneumonias. In children, uncharacteristic or unique imaging presentations may be seen in this disease, so further studies of imaging findings in children are required[21][22][23][24]. As COVID-19 patients are infectious during the incubation period and after disease onset, early diagnosis by imaging is vital.Our study shows that certain findings on CT imaging are characteristic of COVID-19 infection and progression. Understanding the imaging characteristics of COVID-19 is important to support early diagnosis, control, and the evaluation of treatment results.",
