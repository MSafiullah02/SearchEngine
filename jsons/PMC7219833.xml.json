            "text": "Initially designed for hospital simulation centers, laparoscopic skill trainers have been made portable for trainees to practice, master repetition, and develop muscle memory at home. Laparoscopic box trainers and instruments can be purchased from a variety of manufacturers (Table 1). These simulators require the use of both psychomotor and visual\u2013spatial skills essential for successful laparoscopic surgeries. When surveyed, residents felt that box trainers were effective and useful to have at home.9,10 Furthermore, residents randomized to take-home trainers were more likely to practice their skills and had improved suture-retention scores compared with those randomized to institutional trainers.11 The main limitation of a purchased box trainer is cost, making these less feasible for individual training during a pandemic, especially because sharing of trainers is limited by stay-at-home orders (Table 1). Homemade trainers can be made out of cardboard, wood, or plastic boxes, with a web camera or tablet, depending on what supplies are accessible12,13 (Fig. 1). When residents were randomized to a homemade trainer compared with a manufactured trainer, there was no significant difference in time to completion of the practiced Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery tasks.14 Residents using a home trainer had no difference in surgical skill scores compared with those who completed a course of didactics and supervised laparoscopic skill training.15 Furthermore, remote video coaching sessions with an expert surgeon have been found to improve laparoscopic skills in residents.16\u201318 Using a smartphone or tablet with their homemade trainer allows residents to record their efforts and share them remotely with faculty. To encourage use, programs should include goal setting for each task and a log of training time.19 Unlike manufactured trainers that include laparoscopic instruments, homemade trainers require programs to purchase instruments online ($70\u2013$170) or borrow them from the hospital and distribute them by mail or during call shifts. These trainers can be used to help residents prepare for their Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery certification to prevent further delay in examination from lack of preparation. Detailed task instructions and required instruments can be found on both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Curriculum for Resident Education in Surgical Technique and the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery website.20,21",

            "text": "The addition of virtual simulation adds a degree of cognitive skill to the mix of psychomotor and visual\u2013spatial skills used in the generic trainers described above. Students learn from mistakes as they work through different procedures. Virtual reality trainers have been shown to decrease skill-completion time, with better recall of procedural steps compared with watching surgical videos.22,23 A systematic review of 14 randomized trials found that virtual reality training led to improved peg transfer time and improved performance of minimally invasive surgery in a descriptive analysis.24 Nonetheless, the review found no difference in time to completion of laparoscopic tasks on virtual reality trainers compared with standard trainers.24 Some virtual reality trainers lack haptic feedback, a feature that reduces the learning curve and improves realism.25 To ameliorate this limitation, augmented reality simulators have been developed, incorporating the use of physical objects to provide haptic feedback.26 There are several manufacturers for these systems, and they range in price from $2,000 to more than $100,0008 (Table 1). Bulky robotic simulators also exist and cost from $80,000 to more than $137,000, limiting their use in a remote curriculum.27 Given these findings and the substantial cost difference, the standard box trainer is sufficient to enhance remote surgical training; however, when a virtual reality trainer is available, programs should allow its use because it provides the cognitive and coaching feedback not otherwise included in a box trainer.28",

In contrast to the specialized materials needed for laparoscopic trainers, these models use common household materials, such as kitchen sponges to simulate tissue dissection, plastic pipes and tights to simulate anterior colporrhaphy, or modeling clay and pantyhose to simulate a vaginal hysterectomy.29\u201331 Other examples can be found on PubMed, including a modified beef tongue model for fourth-degree laceration repair.32 These models allow trainees to improve their psychomotor and visual\u2013spatial skills while also reinforcing knowledge of gynecologic procedures. Most simulation supplies are relatively low-cost ($7\u2013$100 for the model and $10\u2013$40 for surgical tools or an anatomy dissecting kit) and range in difficulty of construction. Not all publications cite validity of their model or an improvement in performance. Some publications show improved trainee confidence and satisfaction after model use,33\u201335 whereas others show significant improvement in a surgical skill.36,37 One limitation is that these models are usually designed for performance in a structured laboratory led by faculty, with supplemental didactic sessions.38 No studies instructed trainees to perform these models without facilitators. Although remote video coaching is available, more advanced models (such as hysterectomy) require two participants.31,34 Under stay-at-home orders, trainees may create their own models or share using a cleaning protocol. In summary, individuals can build low-cost surgical models to practice all three core skills at home.",

Implementation will vary by program, because these resources vary in price and accessibility. However, in combination, they can be used to develop the psychomotor, visual\u2013spatial, and cognitive skills important for surgical performance. As new curricula are developed during this unique time, it is important to share resources to enhance the accessibility of gynecologic surgical simulation.
