            "text": "Although some consider the use of antimicrobials to treat calf diarrhea to be controversial and not indicated,11, 12 a systematic review of the literature provided strong and unequivocal evidence that specific antimicrobials are efficacious in the treatment of calf diarrhea.1 The initial concern about antimicrobial use in calf diarrhea was derived from the results of studies that indicated oral administration of penicillin, chloramphenicol, and neomycin increased the incidence of diarrhea in healthy calves, produced malabsorption, or reduced growth rate.1 More recent concerns about antimicrobial use in calf diarrhea have focused on whether antimicrobial administration promotes antimicrobial resistance of enteric pathogens and facilitates the emergence of multiple resistant strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars typhimurium and newport. Important considerations when administering antimicrobials as part of the treatment of calves with diarrhea are: (1) administering as directed on the label or by a veterinarian whenever possible; (2) selecting an antimicrobial agent with an appropriate spectrum of activity; (3) using a dosage protocol that attains and maintains an effective therapeutic concentration at the site of infection; (4) treating for an appropriate duration; (5) avoiding adverse local or systemic effects and violative residues; and (6) minimizing the potential for transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes.13 The overarching philosophy is that veterinarians should use and prescribe antimicrobials conservatively to minimize potential adverse effects on animal or human health.14\n",

Bacteremia should also be suspected to be present in 100% of calves with clinical signs of Salmonella diarrhea, although the prevalence of bacteremia in calves with salmonellosis does not appear to have been determined.18 A clinical sepsis score to predict bacteremia19 does not appear to be sufficiently accurate to guide antimicrobial treatment decisions.",

Parenteral administration of antimicrobials is preferred to oral administration, with the ideal parenteral antimicrobial being bactericidal and predominantly Gram-negative in spectrum.1 The ideal parenteral antimicrobial should also be excreted in an active form in bile that results in a local antimicrobial effect in the small intestine.1 Current evidence suggests that antimicrobials should not be administered to diarrheic calves that have a normal appetite, activity level, rectal temperature, and hydration status and the absence of concurrent infections such as pneumonia or omphalophlebitis (Fig. 4\n).23 Instead, these calves should be separated from other calves and their health status monitored frequently.",

However, parenteral fluoroquinolones should be administered only to critically ill calves, such as those calves requiring intravenous fluid administration.13 Aminoglycosides should also not be administered orally because they are very poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Aminoglycosides should not be administered parenterally because of prolonged withdrawal times for slaughter, potential for nephrotoxicity in dehydrated calves, and minimal excretion in bile.1 The results of a 2002 survey of Italian cattle veterinarians indicated that fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides were the first choice antimicrobials for treating calf diarrhea by 54% and 14% of respondents, respectively.26\n",

Another important issue is the potential ban on extralabel use of cephalosporins in the United States. At the time this article was written, the US FDA had proposed a final rule prohibiting any use of extralabel cephalosporins in food producing animals. Because there are no third or fourth generation cephalosporins specifically approved for the treatment of diarrhea in calves, their use would not be permitted if this rule is not amended.",

Meloxicam is an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent that is labeled in Europe for the treatment of calf diarrhea when used in conjunction with oral rehydration therapy. In a randomized multilocation trial of 191 calves in Europe, a single IV injection of meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg bodyweight) in conjunction with a standard treatment (oral electrolyte rehydration solution therapy and parenteral gentamicin) increased feed intake, hydration score, and fecal consistency, and decreased the signs of visceral pain, relative to standard treatment alone.27 In a recent randomized study of 56 calves in Ontario Canada, the subcutaneous administration of meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg, once) resulted in treated calves consuming starter rations earlier than placebo-treated calves. Treated calves also had improved starter ration intakes, a higher body weight gain, and increased activity level than placebo-treated calves.28 Taken together, these results suggest that meloxicam should be considered as part of the initial treatment of calves with diarrhea and systemic illness in those countries where meloxicam is labeled for use in calves.",

            "text": "The growth rate and viability of E coli varies markedly with pH. In gastric juice aspirated from human infants, a pH < 2.5 for 60 minutes was bactericidal for Gram-negative bacteria; an increase in pH from 2.5 to 5.0 was associated with an increased growth rate of Gram-negative bacteria; and the fastest growth rate occurred when pH > 5.0.75 In an unpublished study using a small number of bovine ETEC and colisepticemic strains cultured in abomasal contents and other fluids, E coli was killed when pH \u2264 3.0 but multiplied when pH \u2265 5.0.76 In a related unpublished in vivo study, abomasal luminal pH influenced the numbers of E coli recovered from the abomasum and small intestine of calves infected with a mixture of ETEC and colisepticemic strains. At abomasal pH of 3.0 to 3.7, < 10% of the inoculum dose was recovered, with ETEC strains being more resistant to pH-mediated killing than colisepticemic strains. At abomasal luminal pH of 5.0, both ETEC and colisepticemic strains proliferated.76 Taken together, these studies suggest that E coli is killed when pH \u2264 3.0 and multiplies when pH \u2265 5.0.",

Although STa receptor affinity and density are greatest in the ileum and distal jejunum of the neonatal calf,84 in studies using ligated intestinal segments of Jersey calves aged 3 to 7 days and Holstein calves aged 1 day inoculated with ETEC, a much larger secretory volume was obtained from segments in the proximal small intestine, with the terminal jejunum and ileum producing very little volume following inoculation.34, 35 The mean volumes secreted in the small intestine following ETEC inoculation were as follows (with the intestine divided into six equal parts, from orad to aborad): 36, 24, 30, 13, 10, 0 mL.34 Colonization of the proximal intestine is therefore the critical determinant of the severity of dehydration following infection with ETEC because colonization of the ileum and distal jejunum with ETEC has minimal effect on hydration status as STa is an ineffective secretagogue in this section of the intestinal tract. In summary, decreasing luminal pH in the proximal small intestine will increase nonspecific resistance to ETEC by preventing adherence to epithelial cells by K99 pili and preventing secretion of STa enterotoxin. This observation suggests that feeding ORT solution or water of acidic pH will be beneficial in treating and preventing calf diarrhea. Moreover, alkalinization induced by bicarbonate-containing ORT solutions potentially facilitates growth of ETEC bacteria, expression of K99 pili, and production of STa enterotoxin in the small intestine.",
