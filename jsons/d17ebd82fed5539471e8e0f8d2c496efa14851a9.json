The development of cDNA microarray technologies, coupled with genome information, has provided comprehensive profiles of the gene expression of malignant cells, which have been compared to those of normal cells. 4, 5 TAAs should be expressed excessively and preferentially by the tumor cells but not by the normal tissues, and gene expression profiling with cDNA microarray technologies is an effective approach for the identification of new TAAs. [6] [7] [8] Previous studies have identified several molecular targets useful for the diagnosis and immunotherapy by analyzing genome-wide gene expression profiles of various cancerous tissues with cDNA microarrays. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The present study identified a candidate TAA, forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), based on the results of previous cDNA microarray analysis of the tissues from 25 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. 15 Recently, an elevated expression of FOXM1 has been reported in a variety of human cancers, 12, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] including lung cancer, 21 which is the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. 22 Among normal adult human organs, FOXM1 is expressed only in the testis, thymus, small intestine and colon. 23 The identification of immunodominant epitopes of TAA has highlighted the utilization of these epitopes as promising therapeutic tools for cancer immunotherapy. However, the identification of CTL epitopes remains difficult, because many TAA-derived peptides must be screened for their immunogenicity by using a large number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from the patients with cancer. HLA transgenic mice (Tgm) provides versatile animal models for the preclinical evaluation of peptide-based immunotherapy. 24 Previous investigations have used HLA-A2 Tgm for the identification of HLA-A2-restricted antigenic epitopes. 11 The present study identified FOXM1-derived HLA-A2-restricted epitopes by using HLA-A2 Tgm. CTL lines reactive to these epitopes were also established from cancer patients and healthy donors.

The FOXM1c isoform was more abundant in cultured cells, including those from the normal gastrointestinal tract and these results were consistent with the findings of other studies. 39, 40 FOXM1, a transcription factor, plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, longevity and transformation. Expression profiling has identified a FOXM1-regulated cluster of genes, including many G2/M-specific genes (Cyclin B, CENP-F, Nek-2, etc). 19, 41 The loss of FOXM1 expression in cancer cell lines results in mitotic spindle defects, delays cells in mitosis, and induces mitotic catastrophe. 19, 41 These findings suggest that FOXM1 expression is essential for cancer cell growth and survival.

Three FOXM-1 derived peptides were examined on the actual binding to HLA-A2 by using a TAP-deficient, HLA-A*0201-positive cell line T2. T2 cells, pre-incubated overnight at 26 C, were cultured in the presence of 50 lM peptide and 5 lg/ml b 2 -microglobulin in serum-free medium at 26 C for 1.5 hr and subsequently at 37 C for 18 hr. After the culture, HLA-A2 expression on the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry with anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody BB7.2. A human cytomegalovirus-derived peptide (QYDPVAALF) and a SARS-A2-S-7 peptide (NLNESLIDL) were used as a negative and a positive control, respectively. The fluorescence index (FI) was calculated from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HLA-A2 expressed on T2 cells determined by flow cytometry, using the formula FI \u00bc (MFI [T2 cells with FOXM1 peptide]/MFI [T2 cells with CMV peptide]) \u00c0 1.BIMAS score predicting HLA-A2-binding affinity of the peptides are also indicated.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "CTL induction from PBMCs of HLA-A2-positive healthy donors.
