After seven decades of dominance, this model of \u2018liberal internationalism\u2019 is now under pressure in a rapidly changing world order. The world is already a different place than it was at the turn of the millennium or even a decade ago. The election of a US President, Donald Trump, in November 2016, who is openly hostile to multilateralism on virtually all issues of economic and security cooperation is contributing in no small measure to the fading of liberal internationalism and decline in the importance of global institutions and the rules of post-war Pax Americana (Ikenberry 2018; Norrlof 2018). International liberalism has also been threatened by the rise of far-right \u2018populist\u2019 regimes and nationalisms across the democratic world (Jahn 2018). Furthermore, Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU seems to be having a stressful and divisive effect on European solidarity, which could further undermine the current liberal world order. These changes in the international order are also impacting existing global governance mechanisms (structure, process and agenda) and leading towards a transition or shift in global power distribution and leadership (Kagan 2017; Layne 2018).",

            "text": "An important early indication of growing influence of the RPs on the architecture of global governance was the 1999 shift in global economic power with the transformation of the G8 into the G20 and with the inclusion of China and other key emerging economies, among them India, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa, as the premier forum for international economic cooperation (Keohane 2001; Ullrich 2008; Kahler 2013; Kirton 2015). At the same time, the RPs have maintained a noticeably strong and increasingly influential presence in the United Nations system and other existing multilateral global institutions (WTO, World Bank, IMF). As they become responsible stakeholders in these institutions, the RPs now demand reforms in their governance structures, thereby challenging the existing order. In addition to creating their own parallel or alternative institutions in their preferred image, the RPs view existing global institutions as enablers for the legitimisation of their international engagement. This reveals a new, multi-order tension between the post-Cold War and the newly emerging order. On which side the RPs throw their influence will have a profound effect on which order prevails: a renewed liberal order, or a new, possibly illiberal order.",

Central questions are: how the world should be ordered; who is responsible for addressing global problems in various domains; are there alternatives to existing governance structures and how can change be managed; how can governance be organised so as to confer benefit on peoples across the globe equitably (Gill and Benatar 2006).",

Unlike most of the other spheres of global governance (e.g. finance, trade, climate change, intellectual property rights, labour), health is indeed a truly \u2018global\u2019 phenomenon in the sense that affects the well-being of all humanity and is regarded as right\u2014as enshrined in the 1948 constitution of the World Health Organisation (WHO).",

Lessons from this particular health tragedy\u2014which exposed both the world\u2019s vulnerability to global epidemics and also the extreme effects of the crisis in an unequal global health system\u2014suggest that the determinants of good health are much broader than a single-issue and distinctive governance structure and that the separation or \u2018siloing\u2019 of various issues in the current global health architecture is inappropriate because these are in fact linked both conceptually and logistically in an operational context.",

In addition, recent studies show that economic development and better health lead on the one hand to the epidemiological transition and also to increased migration (which, when dealing with avian flu to TB, poses a health risk): this raises the stakes for countries, especially RPs wherein most migration will take place, to address both health and health economics. Both liberal democracies and RPs can and must show a new way forward, since the old institutions and nationalisms are inadequate to conceive of and cope. How they might do so is part of the focus of this article.",

Global health governance provides a good illustration of the notion of change in the world order as both a cause and effect the rise of new powers among the emerging nations and the challenges they pose to the existing structures which are largely the vestige of the post-World War II global distribution of power. The paper examines how the convergence of the emerging nations\u2014collectively (e.g. global south\u2013south or regional cooperation) and individually (bilateral partnership)\u2014acts within the framework of soft power development diplomacy to bring about \u2018desirable\u2019 modifications to existing global health policy and governance aimed at contributing to the fulfilment of the post-2015 health Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets (Sekalala 2017; Sehovic 2017).

We are witnessing a link between global health (diplomacy) and development (international cooperation)\u2014involving new lead actors, non-state actors (NGOs, private organisations joining with national and local governments). In this regard, the paper analyses how and to what extent Rising Powers are poised to introduce needed patterns of innovation in ideas and institutions to global health policy and governance responses, but also maintains that core elements of existing post-World War II institutions are required for the ongoing transformation of the international order. Innovations in global governance are thus required, including those that diverge from the model of formal, intergovernmental organisations.",

This group of five major emerging economies comprises over 40% of the world\u2019s total population, accounts for nearly 30% of world GDP and has a share of about 24% in world trade. Globally, the political and economic influence of the BRICS is rapidly increasing. Although some BRICS member countries, China and India for example, have been engaged in development cooperation with countries in Africa and Asia for decades, their role as influential development actors has only recently been acknowledged in both the literature and in terms of power distribution in the international order. Once themselves aid recipient countries, these RPs are becoming \u2018donors\u2019 in their own right; rather than simply being a beneficiary of global public goods, they are now actively generating and sustaining development In this transition, they are influencing how development is done.",

Instead, it is to show how important proactive, collaborative and coordinated soft power diplomacy efforts can be for facilitating needed governance innovations and shaping global health policy and what are limitations in reality. The BRICS group of large emerging nations is moving into a position where it can contribute to various programmes and institutions that impact on global health and its governance. These programmes and institutions are not limited to a narrow range of medical-related issues (e.g. responding to pandemics, availability of drugs, capacity strengthening of domestic health systems, R&D, etc.), but include a broader international development cooperation framework that leverages power and accountability, shared responsibility, legitimacy as well as ideology, social and cultural issues that directly and indirectly affect health outcomes. This approach provides a good basis to better understand the events and factors in both development diplomacy and global health policy that enable the RPs to assume a leading role in influencing and introducing governance innovations.",

The aim of these regulations was to standardise international quarantine rules and guidelines for managing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases at the time, specifically cholera, plague and yellow fever. Though not referred to as such, the scientific foundation of health security through international cooperation was further strengthened and consolidated through 13 more international sanitary conferences held in Europe during the second half of the nineteenth century (Howard-Jones 1975). The establishment of the World Health Organisation (WHO) within the United Nations system in 1948 provided a global multilateral framework for monitoring, regulating and managing health risks and promoting health diplomacy. The WHO became the \u2018standard setter\u2019 for global health policy within the context of the international community, and setting the global health agenda, establishing norms and guidelines and engaging partners for international health policy development and implementation. In 1969, the WHO\u2019s World Health Assembly adopted the first International Health Regulations (IHRs) which were revised and updated by the Assembly in 2005 within an environment of global health diplomacy. In the context of the post-war global order, the WHO was unique in terms of its legitimacy as the only international institution with a mandate to promulgate international law within the context of global diplomacy for ensuring health security.",

Individual G8 and G20 members had their own particular priorities regarding global health challenges: Japan focused on fighting global pandemic through the lens of human security; France addressed inequality of access to health services and medicines; the UK called for massive investments and financial transfers from rich to poor countries to fight poverty, perceived as the main driver of poor health status. The launching of the multi-billion dollar US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 gave a big boost to official development aid for health (disease treatment, vaccines and medicines) which more than tripled over the decade. More significantly in terms of global health diplomacy, this initiative represented the strategic use of health interventions in selected developing countries to achieve foreign policy goals of the donor country (Daschel and Frist 2015; Michaud and Kates 2012; Feldbaum et al. 2010).",

Under this scenario, collaborative public\u2013private efforts towards finding solutions to global health problems often involved the exploitation of market dynamics to stimulate investment in research and production capacity for medical products and to drive prices down. At the same time, multilateral organisations and national governments entered into open-ended discussions with civil society organisations, private philanthropic foundations and academics to find solutions to some of the largest health problems facing the global community (Khoubesserian 2009; Moran and Stevenson 2013). Significantly from a governance standpoint, the role of non-state actors (NSAs) in civil society in the success of some of these ventures should not be underestimated: without the moral voice and protests of the AIDS activist movement, it is unlikely that the decisions made by political leaders and multilateral agencies would have been as bold as they were or the financial commitments as large as they were.",

As the Cold War wound down, what some described as unipolar moment emerged which emphasised democratisation over development. Health was not an integral part of the overall development agenda at the time; this lack of interest in health matters was due predominantly to the framing of the role of the state in the national development process essentially in economic terms. What did eventually bring the increase in global health initiatives in the post-cold war era was a convergence between the development and security agendas particularly in the context of the burgeoning HIV/AIDS pandemic (Buzan et al. 1998). This link was necessary to ensure that health issues received the resources necessary to respond. However, over time, this development focus morphed into a predominantly security focus to the point where the response to infectious diseases was no longer part and parcel of health as a global public good but rather as a way of preventing bioterrorism and providing security. This linkage was counterproductive as it distorted health governance agenda and created competitive convergences, as reflected in the North\u2013South power relationship divide (e.g. G7 v African countries) in negotiations. Such a securitised (Buzan et al. 1998; Enemark 2017) approach to global health governance in effect undermined the validity and legitimacy of existing international level organisations (e.g. WHO).",

Single-disease initiatives favoured by prevailing global health policy were not complemented by the strengthening of domestic health systems, as is required for strong and accessible healthcare services. This fundamental weakness in global health policy\u2014neglect of health systems in poor countries\u2014was due to lack of policy coherence at all levels, as well as to gaps and distortions in resource allocation which neglected the poorest and most vulnerable in society. In reality, policy coherence in global health did not evolve fast enough to ensure that emerging globalisation and development issues (challenges and problems) related to public provision of health care were aligned at national, regional and multilateral levels (Lin and Kickbush 2017). Further evidence that the global health architecture was not effective in achieving health improvements on a sustainable basis can be deduced from the unsatisfactory progress towards the achievement of the health-related UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) between 2000 and 2015.",

On the positive side, globalisation fostered the creation of new possibilities for the spread of information and knowledge and resource mobilisation to save lives, increase life expectancy and improve the quality of human health and life. But globalisation also contributed to the spread of disease and death globally due to the rapid increase in economic and social interconnectedness of the world brought about mainly by low-cost communications and budget travel. Globalisation also increased awareness of economic, political and social environments elsewhere which, for example, enabled healthcare professionals badly needed in their own poor countries in the global south to migrate to better jobs and opportunities in richer countries in the north. These changes beg the question: how can states across the globe collectively protect and promote health in an increasingly globalised world?",

In contrast, the organisation\u2019s regular budget, which is used for its core operations, has declined steadily in real terms. Most notably, funding of core work in health emergencies and epidemic and pandemic response has been significantly reduced. In the 6 years leading up to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the WHO\u2019s budget for infectious disease outbreak and crisis response was reduced from US$ 469 million for 2009\u20132010 to $241 million for 2014\u20132015.",

This was exemplified first by the administration\u2019s failure to seek renewed foreign aid funding in 2017 to sustain the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and USAID post-Ebola investments in infectious disease preparedness, resulting in significant scaling down of CDC\u2019s presence and activities in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, the administration\u2019s 2018 proposal to return an unspent amount of US$ 252 million in residual Ebola emergency response funds from the 2014\u20132015 outbreak to Congress could instead have gone towards combating future outbreaks. These developments point towards an abandonment of US global investments in health security preparedness and a reduction in resources available for future outbreak response. The dissolution on the part of the Trump administration of the US governments\u2019 capabilities to effectively manage either of those things has been further compounded by the position of a global health security preparedness czar having become an early casualty of John Bolton\u2019s National Security Council leadership reshuffles.

These relate to key questions: How can greater commitment be ensured by all countries towards the provision for health as a global public good? How can political support be gained for global health action addressing hitherto neglected health needs of the developing regions\u2014e.g. neglected tropical diseases, malnutrition? How can the voice of developing countries be ensured in global health governance when pitted against powerful political and commercial vested interests in developed countries? These complex global health challenges create space for new kinds of action shaped by the realities of global engagements and shifting economic and political power relationships, and present opportunities for governance innovation and institutional change (Scharferhoff et al. 2015; Kickbusch et al. 2016). Today, the global health architecture cannot rely solely on the post-World War II aid-related, traditional north\u2013south divide governance structures.

Some of these challenges indicate necessary normative enquiries concerning the implications of emergent redistributions of economic and political power for the sustainability of and legitimacy of an equitable global health policy and new forms of global health governance. Certain proposals for reform and innovative mechanisms favoured by the RPs for responding to concerns about current global health governance structures also raise important questions of accountability, global shared responsibility, development effectiveness of health aid and suitability in specific political or economic context. Although soft power health diplomacy interventions by the RPs could promote and deepen support for new forms of global health governance, it is also clear that there could be difficulties and tensions in seeking to fundamentally alter existing global governance structures.

The SDGs provide an opportunity to integrate health within the broader development agenda and, if implemented creatively and innovatively, the achievement of the specific health component (SDG 3) and other health-related SDGs and targets can be enhanced through improved governance of global health.

It is in this regard that the contribution of the RPs to global health policy and domestic health sector development should be framed, if at all these are to be relevant for responding to current and emerging global health challenges.

According to the Lancet report, global health convergence will cost US $70 billion per year\u2014which far exceeds current aid flows for health to help finance stronger health sectors. It implies an increasing and evolving role for the RPs as donors and investors in global health to achieve this convergence. This will require investments in \u2018global functions\u2019-type assistance (e.g. global public goods like R&D, data needs, pandemic preparedness and containment of anti-microbial resistance)\u2014as well as \u2018country-specific functions\u2019-type assistance favoured by RPs. Achieving the SDG health targets would thus require substantial new investments over time, some of which may fall outside the boundaries of soft power diplomacy-type assistance. According to the WHO, investment in global health would need to increase from US$ 134 billion annually in 2017 to $371 billion by 2030 to meet the health targets of the SDGs. If the RPs are to assume a significant role in global health or have a strong influence in the WHO as a global normative agency, they would need to ensure that their soft power diplomacy and international development cooperation programmes contribute to a stronger correlation between more spending and better outcomes. This requires introducing innovations and changes to guide those with responsibility for managing health systems at global, regional and country levels to adopt good governance and prudent management practices based on the principle of value for money.",

The expansion of global health initiatives since 2000 has made the global governance system more prone to responding to emergencies than planning to prevent them. There is a need for a more pragmatic mode of cooperation through governance innovation and institutional reform. The WHO, if reformed for example in terms of its funding pattern, management efficiency and governance structure, is in a unique position to support the implementation of the health component of the SDGs 2030 Agenda. Health is an important input to, or impacted by, most of the SDGs targets. Health actors at global, regional, national and sub-national levels are well positioned to contribute to the SDGs health targets. The RPs through soft power development diplomacy need to position themselves in influential ways of organising and prioritising global health efforts and, even prompting a more appropriate global health architecture predicated by global governance innovations, similar to what took place around the turn of the millennium when several new types of global health initiatives appeared on the international scene. But there are key questions still to be addressed: Should global health governance be based on a single lead agency (i.e. the WHO)? How can conflict of interests in decision-making be avoided by the different types of countries among its membership and multiple stakeholders? Should governance arrangements involve distribution of leadership and accountability among stakeholders?",

The tendency in national development strategy of many developing countries is for health and social development challenges to play second fiddle to economic goals such as infrastructure and industrial development. If the BRICS New Development Bank emerges as a focus for improving population well-being, human development and health, this could indeed be one of the wisest investments by the group.

The analysis of the evolution of the RPs as a \u2018change agent\u2019 in the global health scene is illustrated by the efforts of the BRICS group of emerging nations to influence and impact global health and its governance. The rise of BRICS as a major player in global health is an example of mounting efforts by the larger emerging nations towards more equal, sustainable and inclusive structures in many domains of global governance. Through a combination of global action, in the form of soft power development cooperation diplomacy, and governance innovation, the WHO and other global development and humanitarian agencies in the health field are now faced with the challenge of adapting health cooperation to new patterns and structures influenced by the growing power of the RPs in international economic and political environments.",

While there are good governance justifications today for fundamental shifts in some key structures, institutions, systems and norms that shape global health policy, incremental rather than revolutionary changes may be preferable to bring about desirable transformation in governance structures. A clear challenge facing all involved in global health is to determine how to introduce innovations in the current global health architecture, while operating within the institutional framework of existing multilateral arrangements established and universally accepted for the formulation and execution of international health rules and regulations. This might imply a trade-off between processes that prioritise norms and principles of an established system, on the one hand, and the creativity and innovation needed for development effectiveness on the other.",

In this regard, the role of the RPs as an agent of change and promoter of health governance innovation can be strategically framed to advance interventions in health as well as other sectors outside health (e.g. security, macroeconomics, human rights) and to appeal to different audiences within specific contexts and timeframes, in order to achieve desired outcomes. In other words, new global health governance models must recognise the realities of global engagement, different interest groups, capabilities and mandates, and multiplicity of stakeholders (multilateral organisations, the state, public health agencies, health professionals, private sector foundations, \u2018big pharma\u2019, etc.).
