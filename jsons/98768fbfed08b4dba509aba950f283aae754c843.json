Lung infection is a common clinical feature and contributes to disease severity as well as viral transmission. Animal models are often required to study viral infections and therapies, especially during an initial outbreak. Histopathology studies allow for identification of lesions and affected cell types to better understand viral pathogenesis and clarify effective therapies. Use of immunostaining allows detection of presumed viral receptors and viral tropism for cells can be evaluated to correlate with lesions. In the lung, lesions and immunostaining can be qualitatively described to define the cell types, microanatomic location, and type of changes seen. These features are important and necessary, but this approach can have limitations when comparing treatment groups. Semiquantitative and quantitative tissue scores are more rigorous as these provide the ability to statistically compare groups and increase the reproducibility and rigor of the study.

Autolysis (\"self-digestion\") is a postmortem change characterized by degradation of cellular constituents (DNA, RNA, protein) and dissolution of the tissue [15] . Not only can this cause degradation of epitopes and increased nonspecific staining with immunohistochemistry, autolytic regions can be morphologically confused with foci of necrosis and edema [15] [16] [17] . If animals will be euthanized, it is preferable to select a method that does not target the lungs such as an intravenous agent. Even use of inhalational overdose of carbon dioxide, as is commonly used in rodents, can potentially cause minor edema/hemorrhage [11, 18, 19] . Evaluation of controls should be standard to evaluate for antemortem or euthanasiarelated variables affecting lung evaluation. When examining rodents versus lungs from larger animals or humans, sampling becomes a relevant variable. For instance, mice have small lungs that can be sectioned onto one glass slide for widespread evaluation. Larger sized lungs cannot be sampled adequately using only one slide without introducing sampling bias. Therefore, several samples will need to be collected in larger lungs. The collection method will need to be defined in the methods of publications and should include collection site (standardized vs. lesions sites) and total number, the latter of which depends on the size of the lungs, distribution of lung lesions, and overarching goals of the study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 122, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 281, "end": 285, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 480, "end": 484, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 485, "end": 489, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 490, "end": 494, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 755, "end": 759, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 760, "end": 763, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 764, "end": 767, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Factors that Influence Evaluation"}, {"text": "Proper and adequate fixation of the tissues is essential to retain optimal tissue morphology and cellular antigenicity for immunostaining techniques [11, 20] . However, it is important to remember that if lungs are to be assessed or scored for macroscopic (gross) indicators of disease (such as color, surface texture, and consistency), this must be done prior to fixation, which will affect all of these parameters. Macroscopic evaluation and scoring can be a nice tool to complement histopathology lesions [21, 22] . For tissues that will be paraffin embedded, sections are typically fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde, though other fixatives may be employed based on the desired analysis endpoints. Collected lung samples can be placed in a minimum of 20:1 volume of fixative:tissue with a maximal thickness of tissue of no more tha\u00f1 5 mm in at least one dimension to be consistently fixed [20] . For rodents, inflation of the lungs via intratracheal instillation of fixative is recommended to best preserve lung morphology and reduce artifactual atelectasis [15] . However, this approach is contraindicated for lung infection as this can alter the anatomic location of inflammation and cellular debris [22] . The lungs and heart of rodents can be removed en bloc for fixation. Freezing of tissue may be an alternative approach to preserve specific antigens, but this process typically results in suboptimal retention of cellular and tissue architectural detail [11] . After processing to dehydrate the fixed lungs, samples must be embedded and sectioned in a consistent manner. Due to the relatively small size of mice, all lung lobes can be embedded en bloc with the ventral lobar surfaces oriented down in the cassette, which results in sections showing longitudinal views of major conducting airways. An alternative approach for mice, or standard approach for larger species, lung lobes can be collected as multiple sections that fit into a cassette, with each sample embedded separately [11] . Slides are typically stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for routine histologic evaluation. If immunostaining is desired, it is essential to optimize and validate each new antibody utilizing appropriate positive and negative controls to ensure accurate staining results [20, 23] .

Lobation is distinct, in that mice have four right lung lobes (cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory) and only one left lobe, while humans have three right lung lobes (upper, middle, and lower) and two left lobes (upper and lower) [15, 22] . Rats and mice lack intralobular septa, intrapulmonary bronchi, intrapulmonary submucosal glands, and respiratory bronchioles. Mice also have more club cells extending to the trachea, a thinner blood-gas barrier, and a smaller alveolar diameter than humans [11, 26] .

By histopathology, a skilled eye (ideally a pathologist familiar with the model) can not only define the types of inflammatory processes, but also corroborate these findings to clinical signs and/or data from other analyses [22, [27] [28] [29] [30] . In addition, pathologists have knowledge of correct lesion nomenclature, as well as potential effects of such variables as strainrelated background lesions, husbandry, the microbiome, and diet on the interpretation of results [25] . If pathologists are not involved in designing translational experiments and interpreting lesions in animal models, bias may be introduced and the accuracy of the data and conclusions may be questionable. This approach, which lacks the expertise of a pathologist trained in tissue interpretation, has been labeled as \"do-it-yourself pathology\" and is linked to multiple publications containing erroneous interpretations [22, 25, 31, 32] . While observations made by biomedical personnel may be biologically accurate in some cases, it is important to note that tissue examination by non-pathologists (even those who are \"scientific experts\" for a particular disease) is prone to false-positive and false-negative errors and not recommended [33] . Ideally, tissues should be examined by a pathologist familiar with histopathology of the model (see Note 1). It is recognized that not all labs have access to pathologists for this role and in many situations a member of the investigational team is assigned to the role.

For study of infectious diseases, distribution and histologic appearance of lung lesions depends on a variety of factors including the viral inoculate concentration, route of exposure, regional deposition, cellular uptake, chronicity, and host immune response. For instance, inbred mouse strains can have variably sized airways that may affect viral droplet delivery or clinical disease manifestations such as airway obstruction [34] . Inbred mouse strains can also exhibit biased (e.g., Th1 vs. Th2 immune responses) or deficient immune signaling pathways that might influence infection susceptibility or severity [35, 36] . Sex can also be an influencing factor for infection and needs to be considered in the experimental design [37] . Even actions as simple as laying an animal in lateral recumbency to recover from anesthesia following viral inoculation may lead to more prominent lesions in certain lobe(s) [22] . For many of these features, inclusion of appropriate control animals (i.e., strain-, age-, and sex-matched, housed under identical husbandry conditions and free from confounding pathogens) is necessary and important to tease out any lesions unrelated to the treatments. Unlike the other organs in which the size is relatively static, the lung has dynamic size changes during normal respiration. Handing of the postmortem lung in a standardized manner is useful to prevent postmortem atelectasis or variable inter-animal insufflation.

Histopathology of coronavirus-infected lung in humans and animal models can be a useful tool to help define affected cells, illuminate the structural cause(s) of clinical signs, and clarify potential therapies. During disease outbreaks, clinical data including autopsy cases can be studied in parallel with animal model investigations to better define lung disease pathogenesis and therapies. For instance, in 2012 the novel human coronavirus known as MERS-CoV was first isolated from a patient dying in Saudi Arabia [2, 38] . In the region of the outbreak, local burial rituals along with the requirement for high biosecurity constrained autopsy studies from being performed until the first report in early 2016 [4] . Within a few years of the first reported MERS-CoV case in humans in 2012, several animal models were being studied and these models provided much of the initial critically important lung pathology data [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 674, "end": 677, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 678, "end": 681, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 870, "end": 873, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1082, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1097, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1102, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1107, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Histopathology"}, {"text": "Histopathologic examination of viral lung infection requires awareness of any anticipated lesions from clinical or published data, as it is available. Examples of MERS-CoV lesions are listed in Table 1 . For instance, acute diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a common feature of MERS-CoV lung lesions and it is composed of lesions such as edema, inflammation, and alveolar septal injury [4, [48] [49] [50] . While awareness of reported lesions can help guide the pathologist in examination, it is also useful to have a consistent method for examination of experimental tissues to avoid unintentional bias that might cause a failure to detection of unexpected lesions [51] . Consistent examination of all tissues from control and treatment groups can reduce the chances of mistakenly diagnosing nonspecific model background phenotype as a MERS-CoV-specific Table 1 Examples of lesions seen in MERS-CoV lung infections", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 388, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 389, "end": 393, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 394, "end": 398, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 399, "end": 403, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 665, "end": 669, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 201, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 854, "end": 861, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Histopathology"}, {"text": "Necrosis/cell death [45] Edema [8, 21, 45] Hyaline membranes/fibrin [21] Inflammation [8] Thrombi [8, 46] Congestion [8] Hemorrhage [45, 46] Pneumonia [46, 47] Type II hyperplasia [47] Syncytia [47] lesion [22, 25, 29] . For instance, a lesion that is present in the controls and treatment groups can be defined as a background model/technique phenotype and should not be reported as a MERS-CoV specific lesion. Masking of the pathologist to the group assignments is useful to avoid observer bias and each type of masking method has certain advantages and limitations ( Table 2 , see Note 2) [22] . A common approach for histopathologic examination is to start at low magnification to screen for any obvious lesions and assess quality of the tissue section (see Note 3). This allows examination of microscopic structures such as airways, alveoli, alveolar septa, air spaces, vessels, and pleura. Examination at high magnification allows for screening of cellular and interstitial components of each structure for lesions (e.g., injury, inflammation, necrosis). Most slides will be examined using HE, but additional stains can be used on serial sections to further define any changes. For instance, mucus in goblet cells or secreted into air spaces can be highlighted by special stains like Periodic acid Schiff in glycogen-depleted tissues or Alcian blue [55, 56] . After the slides and stains have been examined for all groups, the results will need to be prepared for publication. Qualitative characterization of the findings is very important to understand features of the disease including cellular tropism, anatomic predisposition, and nature of lesions leading to clinical signs (see Note 4) [10, 21] . Qualitative descriptions of lesions include type (e.g., epithelial sloughing/necrosis), location (e.g., alveoli), distribution (e.g., locally extensive), inflammation (e.g., neutrophilic), and cell types involved (e.g., type I pneumocytes). Qualitative features can be sufficiently described in the text and exemplified in representative figures. Use of arrows and other forms of annotation are valuable in figures to clarify and guide readers through the images. High-quality descriptions will help the reader (including reviewers) better understand what was seen and allow for others to reproduce the study. There are several tissue handling (preanalytical) factors that can significantly affect the quality and specificity of immunostaining and its analysis. These have been discussed earlier sections of the paper and in several reviews [20, 52, [60] [61] [62] [63] . Similarly, there are many factors during the staining procedure that itself can also influence the results. Deparaffinization, lack of control tissues, optimization/validation techniques, species, batch effects, and chromogens can all influence the final quality and assessment of immunostaining methods. Standard operating procedures for each of the technical steps, if used by all biomedical staff, can significantly mitigate many of these issues. Use of positive and negative control tissues for each batch of immunostained tissues can help in validating appropriate staining and also making clear any potential nonspecific immunostaining. After the stained slides have been examined for all groups, qualitative statements about the immunostaining can be made and prepared for publication text and images. Descriptive text of immunostaining (receptor or virus) could include cell types (e.g., type I pneumocytes), cell integrity (necrotic vs. intact cells), and subcellular location (e.g., diffuse cytoplasmic). Demonstration of immunostaining using annotated images can strengthen the qualitative data.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 20, "end": 24, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 31, "end": 34, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 35, "end": 38, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 39, "end": 42, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 68, "end": 72, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 86, "end": 89, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 98, "end": 101, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 102, "end": 105, "text": "46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 132, "end": 136, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 137, "end": 140, "text": "46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 156, "end": 159, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 180, "end": 184, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 206, "end": 210, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 211, "end": 214, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 215, "end": 218, "text": "29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "text": "[55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1363, "text": "56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1702, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1706, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2554, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2555, "end": 2558, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2559, "end": 2563, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2564, "end": 2568, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2573, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2574, "end": 2578, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 570, "end": 577, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Lesions"}, {"text": "As shown above, qualitative descriptions of tissue changes are useful and necessary, but they are less applicable in terms of group comparisons.

Semiquantitative methods have several advantages in that they can be done with minimal technical resources, quickly at the microscope for small to medium studies, provide guidance for future quantitative studies, and provide complementary data for publication [52] [53] [54] . The most commonly used semiquantitative methods produce ordinal scores. Ordinal implies there is an order or progression of severity in the assigned grades that define each score, with typically four to five grades being optimal (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Each grade should be well defined so there is minimal ambiguity in assigning samples. Use of simple descriptive modifiers such as normal, rare, mild, moderate, and severe is discouraged as these have different meanings for each observer and thus limit reproducibility of the scoring. As a mock example of ordinal scoring, WT and mutated mice might be evaluated for the extent of hyaline membranes lining alveolar walls. The scoring grades might look like: \"0\"-none, \"1\"-<25% (see Fig. 1d ), \"2\"-26-50% (see Fig. 1e ), \"3\"-51-75%, and \"4\" >75% of alveolar walls in the lung section. If the ordinal scoring for seven mice per group produced the following results for WT (3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4) and mutated mice (1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2) , then the data can be statistically analyzed.

If choosing to perform quantitative scoring, evaluation of clinically relevant anatomic compartments (airways or alveoli) can help standardize the assessment. As a mock example, viral immunostaining could be evaluated as a percent of cell number in mouse bronchioles (Fig. 2a-c ; 0%, 12.5%, and 43.8%, respectively) or as an alternative one could also assess the area of immunostaining as a percent of the bronchiolar epithelium area. In contrast, the alveolar compartment can be more difficult to assess than airways because of their thin walls, which makes evidence of necrosis/ sloughing or immunostaining a challenge. To normalize analysis, one could assess the percent of alveoli with immunostaining ( Fig. 2d-e) . However, this would likely require extensive time/ labor or specialized software. If quantitation is not feasible but is an important variable, one could revert to semiquantitative scoring to assess immunostaining as a percentage of affected alveolar walls. Using the distribution scoring system defined for Fig. 1 , one could score the samples in Fig. 2d -e, as ordinal scores of 1 and 4, respectively.
