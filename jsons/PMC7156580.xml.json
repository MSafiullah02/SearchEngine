The pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus-2 that currently has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV.1 Patients with the infection have been in the hospital, in family and work environments, and in communities. The World Health Organization has recently declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern.2,3 At the end of January 2020, mainland China reported 11 791 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections that resulted in 259 deaths.4,5 Initially, cases were thought to arise from zoonotic transmission; however, recently published literature reveals evidence of human-to-human transmission that increased exponentially by travel, with many cases detected in other parts of the world.6-8 This geographic expansion beyond the initial epicenter of Wuhan provides an opportunity to study the natural history of COVID-19 infection.9 In relation to the transmission risk of COVID-19,10 on January 25, 2020, the Italian Ministry of Health issued the first order with prophylactic measures against COVID-19. After the first one, many ordinances and regulatory circulars defined both prevention measures of behavioral and treatment rules for suspected cases. On February 20, 2020, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in a hospital in Codogno, Italy (a little city of Lodi province in the low Po Valley), hereafter defined as the \u201cred zone\u201d (no entry or leave zone, including 10 cities around Codogno, with quarantine commitment for all citizens). This represented the starting point for extraordinary measures of national and regional management evolving on the basis of the infections registered.",

In the first day, we received patients with a rate of high flux access every 12 hours for a total number of 120. Patients accessed and the trend of treatment were focused on the resolution of acute respiratory failure, but without real knowledge of the presentation of symptoms. The observation in the first days allowed us to identify the common symptoms and signs of the infection, and from this observation the director of the ED designed a model to effectively triage patients and obtain rapid frame rates of respiratory failure and responsiveness of the patients to the oxygen treatment. The director was able to redistribute the ED areas for the different types and needs of patients in scale model and at the same time develop clinical documentation of rapid interpretation to evaluate the improvement or deterioration of the patients (Figure 1), all the while identifying the necessary devices to guarantee the treatment of symptoms.",

The ED represented the key node for the remodeling of the hospital based on the accesses and the first epidemiological data collected. At the end of the first high influx of patients, we needed 5 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, 20 beds for patients using ventilation support (CPAP), and 40 beds for patients with pneumonia using oxygen support. It\u2019s not possible to wait for the result of the test from a nasopharyngeal swab13 (collecting a sample from the back of the nose and throat), because the influx of patients into the ED was at a 12-hour rate and test results came in nearly 72 hours. The ED has been available for non-COVID-19 patients with direct access after triage and dedicated diagnostics, where 2 visiting rooms and a shock room for red codes have been set up.",

            "text": "The health care distribution of the hospital has been completely changed since the third day of the emergency and with fluid progress on the basis of needs. The first measures covered critical areas. But as a first step it was necessary to stop all routine and non-urgent outpatient activity to provide more efficient discharge processing of patients and to free up as many beds as possible in the wards. After the recruitment of beds, it was necessary to change the wards destination and the structural creation of filter zones.14,15\n\nIntensive care: from time zero, all patients hospitalized in \u201csub-intensive\u201d (pulmonary failure or cardiac failure) observation beds were sent to the ordinary ward and such beds were recovered as ICU beds. This allowed increasing the ICU capacity from 7 beds to 17 and predisposing in operating rooms intended for routine minor surgery with available ventilators, lifesaving places for non-viral patients.\nWards: wards and beds have been created for patients with respiratory syndrome. As the first step, an area (at the previous neurology ward, where there were 4 beds monitored and potentially ventilator-equipped) of 18 beds became a critical pneumological area. It was possible to do this in 3 days with structural and logistical changes, creating a filter zone, and defining warehouse and sanitary areas. After these, 2 more 40-bed wards were set up for patients with oxygen needs without the need for intensive or sub-continuous monitoring and again intervening on structure and logistics. At the end of the first week, the hospital completely changed its face. This has also allowed the resumption of deferred urgent activities, including surgical activity.\n",

The only country with published data and epidemiological or management studies was represented by the Chinese reality.9,10,17,18 However, the health system and the Chinese government represent a very far model from the Italian reality where health is regional and where each ASST has significant autonomy, such as the possibilities available to try to improve and optimize management and logistical choices. Applicable and effective models could result: major-emergency management and military management. Both systems ensure resource optimization in relation to large inflows.19 Starting from the concept of advanced medical post and the use of the action plan for the major-emergency, we were able to organize the crisis unit as the hospital\u2019s operations center. At the same time, however, we were not certain about the number of infections or about the real needs of patients. This was the critical point for the initial management. It was therefore necessary to initiate internal analyses that were possible due to the efforts of the ED where epidemiological and health data are recorded up to the first access. After 72 hours, it was therefore possible to have not only the pattern of inflows, but also a realistic prediction of the necessary resources. Every effort was made to have a fluid model inside the hospital. Prospectively, patient management presents a linear management mode for patients who respond to only oxygen therapy: from ED to ward, circular one for the patient in need of ventilator support, from the ED will have to be allocated in 1 of the ventilated areas (depending on the need: ICU or sub-intensive) and then return to the ward. The hospital day by day owing to the data collected and to the great structural and logistical effort was designed as a fluid and circular model. However, the confrontation with the regional government and its health facilities has become decisive and fundamental. In fact, the circular model provides for the need for the involvement of different structures. The first-line hospital, in this case, is represented by a provincial hospital with a capacity limited to 300 beds. The role of the first-line hospital is to ensure framing and need of the patient, but large-scale management of the patients involved must be matched.20 This is why the regional network and transfers made it possible not to collapse at the first accesses of the frontline structure. This dynamics model was difficult to realize without reference models and without knowing the number of casualties, and this was not possible to obtain from the beginning; but the presence of all the representations in the management of the crisis has meant that, despite the low sensitivity of prospective data, the model has been applied allowing the management of the first phase of the emergency. In the same way, decentralized management of the first phase in the frontline hospital has allowed other structures, albeit in different ways, to prepare suitable space and line of management for COVID-19 patients.",
