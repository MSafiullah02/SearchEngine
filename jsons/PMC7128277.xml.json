However, lack of an aetiological diagnosis could hamper efforts to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission and the efficient use of the proper antiviral drugs. In order to evaluate the relative impact of a novel virus, laboratory\u2010confirmed data are needed on hospitalization rates for and clinical courses of respiratory viral infections.",

Bronchiolitis (defined as a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, tachypnoea, retraction and diffuse crackles on auscultation in infants within 1 year) was the most frequent clinical diagnosis, and 49% of these cases were RSV single infections; the second most frequent single agent was RV (7%), whereas 16% of bronchiolitis cases were infected with other viruses or co\u2010infected; no viruses were found in the remaining cases. Pneumonia was the second most frequent clinical diagnosis, and RSV was the most frequent viral pathogen found (47% of virus\u2010positive cases). It is noteworthy that 7/8 children aged >1 year affected with A/H1N1/2009 were diagnosed with pneumonia.",

Thus, although RV showed a tendency to circulate at the end of either the A/H1N1/2009 or RSV peaks, RV infections also occurred at the same time as infections with the two major respiratory viruses, A/H1N1/2009 and RSV, and presented a rate of co\u2010infections (20% of positive samples) consistent with previous reports [16, 17]. Interestingly, in this study, A/H1N1/2009 occurred as a single infection, whereas RSV presented with a low frequency of co\u2010infection (7%). The relatively low rate of mixed respiratory virus infections (only about 4% of the total number of samples) and the low percentages of detection of PIV1, PIV3 and hMPV found in this study as compared with our previous studies [7, 8], in which the same RT\u2010PCR reactions were used, could be explained by the unusual prevalence of an influenza A virus, A/H1N1/2009, in October\u2013November. In fact, several papers [18, 19, 20] have reported changes in respiratory virus circulation in the past season, and suggested, as a possible explanation, that the activation of innate immunity resulting from a respiratory infection would prevent superinfection with other respiratory pathogens [21]; further studies are needed to investigate this possibility.",

These findings are consistent with previous reports, and might imply either that leukocytes are not alerted by RSV infection or that they are being recruited at specific sites away from the circulating blood, as has been suggested by others [22, 23, 24]. Lymphocyte and eosinophil counts were significantly increased in RV\u2010infected infants as compared with other groups; as blood eosinophil counts are predictors of reactive airway disease, our finding is consistent with studies reporting early RV infections as an important risk factor for recurrent wheezing [25, 26].",

The rate of A/H1N1/2009 pneumonia diagnosis found in this study is consistent with previous reports of A/H1N1/2009 pulmonary replication greater than that expected from a seasonal influenza virus [5, 27]. It has been suggested that the greater rate of pneumonia might perhaps differentiate A/H1N1/2009 from seasonal influenza [4]; however, this criterion will not help to discriminate it from other respiratory virus infections, as pneumonia, being a clinical diagnosis, is not suggestive of a specific viral infection.",

As an example, even though treatment with systemic corticosteroids is not recommended in cases of RSV infection, it has been reported that administration of prednisolone to hospitalized children with first episodes of wheezing associated with RV infection reduces the frequency of relapse [28].",
