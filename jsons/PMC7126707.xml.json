Specifically, more than or equal to 8000 copies/mL of the lytA gene detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and greater than or equal to 15,000 cfu/mL of Streptococcus pneumoniae by quantitative culture in nasopharyngeal swabs were associated with the development of pneumococcal pneumonia.

Although generally more virulent compared with hospital-acquired (HA-MRSA) strains,91 CA-MRSA tends to be more susceptible to non-beta-lactam antibiotics (such as clindamycin, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) as a result of a shorter SCCmec mobile element (types IV and V) that is less able to carry additional resistance genes. Specific CA-MRSA strains (eg, USA300) have been associated with the production of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin,92, 93, 94 which lyses neutrophils, often resulting in necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, or empyema.68, 95 Various reports of the USA300 strain causing severe, rapidly progressive, necrotizing pneumonia (mainly in otherwise healthy children and young adults) with high associated mortality have been well documented.69, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 In a systematic review of 114 patients, the estimated incidence of MRSA CAP was 0.5 to 0.6 cases per 100,000. Seventy-five (69%) out of 109 patients were younger than 35 years, influenza-like symptoms were present in 41% of patients, and the majority (75%) had multilobar consolidation or bilateral lung infiltrates.
