However, analyses of the pooled North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and European Carotid Surgery Trial data have shown that the benefit of surgery is considerable reduced when patients are treated more than 2 weeks after the presenting symptoms. 3 To ensure the care for patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease during the COVID-19 outbreak, we decided to temporarily switch our primary form of treatment from CEA to carotid artery stenting (CAS) because CAS does not require anesthetics or intensified care on a standard basis. The use of CAS can achieves long-term benefits similar to those with CEA but has been associated with an increased risk of periprocedural stroke or death. 4 Within our center, a tertiary referral center located in the northern region of The Netherlands, we evaluated the results for CEA and CAS for the past 2 years to assess the safety of CAS in daily practice. The primary endpoint was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 90 days after the procedure. A total of 155 patients had been treated from January 2018 to December 2019 for symptomatic carotid artery disease. Of the 155 patients, 110 had undergone CEA and 44 had undergone CAS because severe comorbidities, a hostile neck, or a high cervical carotid bifurcation. Within the CAS group, 2 postprocedural hemorrhagic stroke events occurred (4.5%). One patient experienced intracerebral hemorrhage within 90 days of treatment. For that patient, clopidogrel was replaced by ticagrelor, in addition to aspirin, because of poor (0%) platelet aggregation inhibition with clopidogrel, as measured by P2Y12 platelet function testing. The second patient had had symptoms of a transient ischemic attack on the ward, with no new ischemic damage found on a computed tomography scan but an unexpected asymptomatic thalamic hemorrhage under triple anticoagulation regimen. Both patients recovered completely. One patient had developed amaurosis fugax 6 months after CAS because of in stent stenosis, with explantation of the stent performed, followed by formal endarterectomy.",
