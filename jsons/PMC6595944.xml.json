In the United States, 50 to 70% of the 4 million newborns each year are infected during their first winter, and 1 to 3% are hospitalized, 4 to 7% are seen in emergency departments, and 10 to 16% require physician office visits because of RSV [6]. Although mortality is low in the United States (approximately 50 deaths annually), in developing countries RSV is estimated to cause as many as 118,000 deaths, 6 million cases of severe acute lower respiratory illness, and 3 million hospitalizations annually in children younger than 5 years [7,8]. In addition, severe RSV infection has been linked to development of asthma and implicated recently in development of chronic obstructive lung disease [9-12].",

In addition, high RSV viral load has also been associated with more severe disease in several but not all studies [16], and although group A RSV strains are more common than group B strains among hospitalized infants, the relationship of viral genetic differences to disease severity has not been demonstrated conclusively [17-22].",

            "text": "RSV is not considered highly cytopathic in airway epithelium, whereas host immune responses are thought to be a major contributor to disease pathogenesis [23,24]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in a number of cytokine and chemokine genes (IL-1, IL-4, IL-8, IL-13, IL-18, RANTES, CCR5), Toll-like receptor 4, and vitamin D receptor have been associated with increased risk of severe disease [25-28]. In contrast, high levels of cord blood neutralizing antibody are associated with delayed onset of hospitalization with RSV and diminished illness severity [29-31]. High levels of maternally derived RSV-specific antibody at infection have also been associated with diminished illness severity in 2 recent reports [31,32]. The most compelling evidence of the beneficial effect of antibody comes from studies of prophylactic administration of immunoglobulin with high titers of RSV neutralizing antibodies or monoclonal antibody to high-risk infants that demonstrate approximately 50% reductions in hospitalization from RSV [33,34]. Some studies suggest that a type 2 helper (Th2)\u2013biased response during primary infection may also be a contributing factor to disease severity [35-37]. Finally, more severe RSV disease has been associated with greater abundance of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae in the nasal microbiota during RSV infection [38-40].",

We will use graphical methods such as histograms, Q-Q plots, and box-plots to visualize the data and identify potential data problems such as outliers, missingness, and skewness. For continuous variables, we will test their normality by Shapiro-Wilk test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If problems are detected, appropriate data preparation steps such as outlier removing, data imputation, and log-transformations will be considered. For those variables that pass the normality test, we will perform 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) F test followed by Bonferroni post hoc testing for pairwise group comparisons. When groups exhibit unequal variances, Welch ANOVA method will be used instead. For non-normal variables, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn post hoc test will be used instead. Extended Fisher exact test will be used to compare the proportions of categorical variables such as gender and race between cohort groups. Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis will be used to assess associations between 2 continuous variables such as severity and gene expression levels. Multivariate linear regression will be used to model the associations between covariates and continuous outcome variables, controlling for possible confounding effects such as age and sex. ANOVA F test and regression t test will be used to assess the significance of the overall and specific linear association between the covariates and the outcome variables. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to model associations between covariates and categorical outcome variables such as hospitalization, controlling for possible confounding effects. The Wald test will be used to assess significance of the association between covariates of interest and the outcome variables. P values <.05 will be considered statistically significant for standard statistical analyses. Some research aims involve analyzing high-throughput data such as RNAseq-based transcriptomic data and 16S-based microbiome data, and we will apply suitable multiple testing procedures, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, to control false discovery rate at a prespecified level (0.05) [58]. These high-throughput data may have high-level of between-sample variations, in part because of technical issues such as technical noise and batch effects. These undesirable variations can be reduced by a combination of stringent quality assurance analysis and specialized data transformation techniques. Specifically, samples with insufficient quality metrics (low read number, mapping rate or poor sample-wide correlation) will be excluded from analysis. Before statistical analysis, we will explore the dataset by principle component analysis (PCA), principal coordinates analysis, and hierarchical clustering to identify any unwarranted structure or association. If necessary, batch correction methods such as ComBat [59] and surrogate variable analysis [60] may be applied. Due to the non-normal nature of these data, specialized normalization methods and analytical pipelines will be used whenever appropriate [53,60-69]. All statistical analyses will be performed in R 3.3.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute).",

            "text": "Primary hypothesis: Our primary hypothesis is that we will be able to identify a number of factors associated with disease severity during primary RSV infection in full-term healthy infants. The first step toward this goal was to develop a Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS) reflecting the severity of the entire illness as the main outcome variable in most of our analyses [70]. PCA and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the 9 optimal clinical parameters and their relative weights that comprise the GRSS (available as a Web-based algorithm [71]). We will assess each of the following datasets for their association with disease severity: (1) CD4+, CD8+ T cell, B cell ,and NK cell gene expression during RSV infection; (2) nasal epithelial cell gene expression before, during, and after RSV infection; (3) CD4+ and CD8+ cytokine synthesis as measured by flow cytometry during and after RSV infection; (4) serum antibody to RSV F and G proteins and the conserved central CX3C G protein region; (5) serum neutralizing titers to RSV A2 and B1 viruses during and after infection; (6) nasal microbiota composition before, during, and after RSV infection; (7) viral load; and (8) complete RSV genomic sequences. Each analysis will be adjusted for confounding demographic variables such as sex, gestational age, breast feeding history, age at infection, history of exposure to tobacco smoke, coinfection with other respiratory viruses, and the presence of pathogenic bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis as determined by direct PCR. Most importantly, we will seek to integrate several datasets in complex analyses to assess various interactions between virus, nasal epithelial cell and T cell gene expression, nasal microbiota, and adaptive immune responses as they relate to disease severity. Due to the inclusion of multiple high-dimensional datasets, we plan to assemble novel data integration pipelines that use state-of-the-art dimension reduction methods such as multi-omics factor analysis [72] and multi-set canonical correlation analysis [73] to extract the most informative features from individual high-throughput datasets, and afterwards, use statistical learning techniques such as penalized regression [74-76] and support vector machine classification [77] to predict disease severity. Strict cross-validation criterion will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Recently, we developed FUNNEL, which is a time-course gene set enrichment method that has the capability to incorporate both between-gene correlation and weights [78]. We propose to design a new weighting method based on supervised principal component analysis [79] and extend FUNNEL for cross-sectional data and use this new method to study the biological functions of key genes with the largest absolute loadings in the extracted principle components/canonical vectors.",

We believe the relatively intensive commitment required on the part of young parents, often with the stress of caring for their first infant, resulted in a higher than anticipated attrition rate among the birth cohort. To adjust for loss of subjects in the birth cohort, we modified the enrollment strategy to include infants seen in the outpatient setting for acute respiratory illness or during routine visits for immunization when they were noted to have very mild respiratory signs. This modification of the enrollment strategy resulted in enrollment of mildly ill RSV-infected infants, thus, allowing development of a GRSS with a scale of 0 to 10 that spans the entire severity spectrum. This tool will allow us to utilize the severity endpoint as either a dichotomous or continuous variable in our analyses of the various parameters measured. As these datasets are completed, they will be made available in public repositories for use by other investigators.",

The methods we have developed to interrogate nasal gene expression, which appears to be a reasonable surrogate of the airway and is capable of being recovered from infants of varying age and health status, is highly novel. This approach is clearly capable of providing significant new opportunities to define the molecular status of the airway in ill infants, a major impediment to prior research of infant lung diseases [80]. We also chose to separate peripheral blood cells into major subtypes before interrogation of their gene expression. Although this raised some significant technical challenges, they have been overcome [37,50]. Furthermore, this approach allows us to better achieve our primary objectives of defining the biology of the system and how it is affected by disease state.",
