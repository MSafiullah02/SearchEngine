Since some decades ago mathematical community and specialists in computer sciences investigate biological questions to propose models describing subjects such as diseases, physiological phenomena. One of these models are formulated with the help of Differential Equations (SIR models, reaction diffusions equations, etc.) while others use computer sciences (see [20, 13, 8, 7, 5] ). In this work, for the mathematical modeling part, we are going to use the SIR model without demography because the lifespan of the disease which is an influenza disease will be very short compared to the lifespan of humans (even if the flu lasted 2 years which would be exceptional, 2 years do not represent much compared to the average longevity of a man). Similarly for This work was completed with the support of the NLAGA project. arXiv:2004.01574v1 [q-bio.PE] 3 Apr 2020 this type of disease it is also assumed that there will be no significant renewal of the population while it is raging. The last influenzas that seriously affected humanity did not last long (H1N1 for example) even if this new virus hitherto seriously defies science. Our aims are first, to collect carefully the pandemic data from the [3] , e.g. https://www.tableau.com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources, from January 21, 2020 to April 02, 2020. In the second step, we propose two technics, a SIR model and machine learning tools, to analyze the coronavirus pandemic in the worldwide. The article is organized as follows. In the section 2, we present some auxiliary results of the SIR model (model, estimation of parameters) and the machine learning technics for forecasting, followed by the simulations and results in section 3. Finally, in the section 4, we present conclusions and perspectives.",

The authors think that the part of identification could be deepen. Indeed, one way should be to to consider in general the identification of systems. It is the operation of determining the dynamic model of a process (system) from input / output measurements. Knowledge of the dynamic model is necessary for the design and implementation of an efficient regulatory system. In other words, the identification of a real dynamical system (called object) is to characterize another system (called model), starting from the experimental knowledge of the inputs and outputs so as to obtain an identity of behavior. In practice, the purpose of identification is generally to determine the conduct model, which can be used to simulate, control or regulate a process. This model can be physical (in the sense of analog or digital simulator and reduced model), or an abstract model (mathematical model, i.e. system of algebraic or differential equations (ODE or PDE)). Finally, note that some addressed questions in parameter identification are the recognizing of sets (domains, curves, etc.). Finally, note that some addressed questions in parameter identification are the recognition of sets (domains, curves, etc.). And a final remark is the identification of geodesics: In almost every epidemic, there is a phenomenon of super-propagation (super spreader)-when a person transmits an infection to a large number of people. And super spreader phenomena may appear. The role of super-spreaders it is the fact, noticed by Erds [4] , that in a random graph there is always a small number of very connected people, through which almost all geodesics pass. How could it be possible to identify these facts in this pandemic?",
