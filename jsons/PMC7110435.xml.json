About two-thirds of the CCoV genomic RNA is occupied by two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two polyproteins involved in viral replicase formation. The 3\u2032 one-third of the genome consists of other ORFs encoding the structural proteins S, E, M and N (ORF2, ORF4, ORF5 and ORF6, respectively) as well as non-structural proteins (Enjuanes et al., 2000).",

Recently, a new genotype of CCoV was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in faecal specimens of naturally infected puppies. We designated the classical strains as CCoV type II and the new strains as CCoV type I. This new designation is not based on the chronological order of discovery of the viruses, but on the genetic identity between CCoV type II and FCoV type II and between CCoV type I and FCoV type I (nt identity 73% and aa identity 74\u201375%) (Pratelli, 2006, Pratelli et al., 2003a, Pratelli et al., 2003b, Pratelli, 2006).",

CCoV is highly contagious, and once the virus has become established in the environment the spread of the infection is difficult to control. Avoiding contact with infected dogs and their excretions is the only way to ensure disease prevention. Crowded, unsanitary conditions, stress during training and other factors appear to favour the development of clinical disease. Like other enveloped viruses, CCoV is inactivated by most germicidal agents such as lipid solvents, formalin, phenol, hypochlorite solution and \u03b2-propiolactone, but these substances do not prevent dog to dog transmission (Appel, 1987). The virus is acid-stable and is not inactivated at pH 3.0 and +20\u201322 \u00b0C (Binn et al., 1974, Appel, 1987). Like other coronaviruses, CCoV is relatively heat-stable; it can be stored for years frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C or lyophilized at +4 \u00b0C (Tennant et al., 1994).",

Each sample exposed to alkaline (pH 7.62, pH 9.98, pH 11.09 and pH 13.2) and acid conditions (pH 2.26, pH 4.38 and pH 6.34) was divided into three aliquots and incubated in duplicate at different temperatures: +4 \u00b0C, +25 \u00b0C and +37 \u00b0C. After 1 h incubation, the samples were reversed to neutral conditions, pH 7, with a buffered solution and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C.

Glutaraldehyde, a dialdehyde, is supplied at an acid pH which makes it more stable but less active; it is activated by making the solution alkaline before use. As the external pH is altered from acidic to alkaline, more reactive sites will be formed on the cell surface, leading to a more rapid bactericidal effect. The cross-links thus obtained make the cell unable to undertake most, if not all, of its essential functions (McDonnell and Russell, 1999). A 2% solution is active against bacteria, spores and viruses. Glutaraldehyde is mainly used to disinfect medical instruments and, occasionally, as an inactivating agent for vaccines.",

Kariwa et al. (2004) observed that irradiation with ultraviolet light at 134 \u03bcW/cm2 for 15 min reduced the infectivity from 3.8 \u00d7 107 to 180 TCID50/mL; however, prolonged irradiation for 60 min failed to eliminate the remaining virus, leaving 18.8 TCID50/mL. The studies performed by Darnell et al. (2004) revealed that UV\u2013A light exposure of SARS-CoV for a 15 min period had no significant effect on virus inactivation. In contrast, exposure to UV\u2013C light resulted in partial inactivation after 1 min with increasing efficiency up to 6 min and, after 15 min, the virus was completely inactivated to the limit of detection of the TCID50 assay (<1.0 TCID50/mL). The results of the present study are not in agreement with the findings of Darnell et al. (2004) that showed SARS-CoV inactivation by UV\u2013C light treatment for 15 min. In our study CCoV exposure to UV\u2013C demonstrated no significant effects on virus inactivation over a 15 min period and a 3 day exposure was needed to obtain a substantial decrease. The apparent UV\u2013C light stability of CCoV in contrast to SARS-CoV as described by Darnell et al. (2004) may be explained by the different UV\u2013C light intensities employed during the experimental procedures.",

Their results differed but suggested that the S glycoprotein, which regulates several biological functions, such as attachment to cells, fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes and cell to cell fusion, might be sensible to pH variations (Weismiller et al., 1990, Xiao et al., 2003). Fusogenic glycoproteins of several groups of enveloped viruses, undergo pH-induced conformational changes. Alphaviruses and orthomyxoviruses infect host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and penetrate the cytoplasm by fusion in acidic endosomes. This fusion appears to be mediated by an irreversible conformational change that requires a pH range of 5.0\u20136.0 (Kielian and Helenius, 1985, White and Wilson, 1987). Envelope glycoproteins of bunyaviruses, rhabdoviruses and murine retroviruses also exhibit conformational changes at pH 5.0\u20136.0 that make them fusogenic (Gonzalez-Scarano, 1985, Redmond et al., 1984). By contrast, paramyxoviruses and the human immunodeficiency virus penetrate cells at the plasma membrane directly without endocytosis and have fusogenic glycoproteins that are activated at pH 7.0 to 8.0 (McClure et al., 1988, Okada, 1962).",

It therefore seems likely that the pH optimum for coronavirus induced fusion, would be neutrality or alkalinity. Pocock and Garwes (1975) analyzed the influence of pH on the growth of TGEV and its stability in adult pig thyroid cell culture. The adsorption, penetration and uncoating steps of the viral replicative cycle were shown to be unaffected by pH variations. Synthesis of TGEV RNA during the first 12 h post infection was not influenced by pH variations ranging from 6.5 to 8.0. After 12 h a breakdown of the RNA occurred in cultures kept at pH 7.2 and 8.0 but not at pH 6.5. When incubated at +37 \u00b0C for 24 h, virus infectivity was scarcely affected by pH 6.5 but when kept at +4 \u00b0C for the same length of time, it remained unchanged between pH 5.0 and 8.0. In the present study CCoV was observed to be most stable at pH 6.0\u20136.5 with an elevated surviving fraction in different environmental conditions. The effects of alkaline treatment were markedly different since the infectivity titre was annulled. Extreme acidic conditions, pH 2.26, inactivated the virus. It is likely that the virus maintains its infectivity only at +4 \u00b0C thanks to its considerable stability at refrigerated conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that profound changes are induced in CCoV with variations in pH.",

The pH-dependent thermolability observed in MHV infectivity is the result of conformational changes in the spike glycoprotein S (Sturman et al., 1990). The virus is quite stable at pH 6.0 and +37 \u00b0C, but it is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by a short treatment at pH 8.0 and +37 \u00b0C, during which the amino-terminal peptide S1 is released from the virions and the remaining peptide S2 remains associated with the virus envelope and forms aggregates. These modifications are presumed to be associated with virus entry and virus-induced fusion of target cells and indicate that an irreversible conformational change, i.e. a rearrangement of intramolecular disulfide bonds, has been induced in the glycoprotein by these conditions. Although it does not seem to be essential for entry and spread of the virus (Hingley et al., 1998), proteolytic cleavage of the S protein of MHV has been shown to be a prerequisite for MHV fusion but not for the Group I coronaviruses (Sturman et al., 1990).",

The present study provided evidence that exposure of CCoV to extreme basic or acidic conditions at +37 \u00b0C resulted in inactivation, while treatment within the neutral pH range did not. The pH of gastric secretions ranges from 1.0 to 3.5, while the secretions of the small and large intestines range from pH 7.5 to 8.0 (Guyton and Hall, 1997). All these observations suggest that entry of CCoV particles per os may result in the inactivation of most of the virions by stomach acidity. However, two important aspects need to be taken into due consideration: (1) the pH of gastric secretions might be partially neutralized by a particularly large meal or the ingestion of antacids, providing the virus with a chance to reach the slightly basic conditions of the intestines (Darnell et al., 2004); and (2) the route of CCoV infection is oro-nasal.",

In the past, formalin was used to inactivate viruses for vaccines. Excessive treatment can destroy immunogenicity whereas insufficient treatment can leave infectious virus capable of causing disease. Soon after the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine, there was an outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis in the USA due to the distribution of an inadequately inactivated vaccine.

Reviews have been published regarding its mechanisms of action (McDonnell and Russell, 1999, Gorman et al., 1980, Power, 1995). The first reports in 1964 and 1965 (Gorman et al., 1980) demonstrated that glutaraldehyde possessed high antimicrobial activity. Subsequently, research was undertaken to evaluate the nature of its bactericidal (Munton and Russell, 1970a, Munton and Russell, 1970b, Munton and Russell, 1972, Munton and Russell, 1973a, Munton and Russell, 1973b, McDonnell and Russell, 1999), and sporicidal (Gorman et al., 1984a, Gorman et al., 1984b, Thomas and Russell, 1974a, Thomas and Russell, 1974b) actions. Glutaraldehyde is a potent virucidal agent (Kobayashi et al., 1984). It reduces the activity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and especially hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Adler-Storthz et al., 1983) and interacts with lysine residues on the surface of hepatitis A virus (HAV) (Passagot et al., 1987). Low concentrations (<0.1%) of alkaline glutaraldehyde are effective against purified poliovirus, whereas poliovirus RNA is highly resistant to aldehyde concentrations up to 1% at pH 7.2 and is only slowly inactivated at pH 8.3. In the light of this, it has been inferred that glutaraldehyde-induced loss of infectivity is associated with capsid changes (Bailly et al., 1991).",

At +4 \u00b0C formaldehyde significantly inactivated the virus after only 24 h, while the effect of glutaraldehyde was partially inhibited. At room temperature and at +37 \u00b0C, both aldehydes inactivated the virus after 24 h, even if with slight differences. Considering that formaldehyde and especially glutaraldehyde are often used as disinfectants for prophylaxis, care should be taken to establish the appropriate concentration, time and temperature to achieve and complete CCoV inactivation. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that treatment with heat, formalin, glutaraldehyde and extreme pH values are able to inactivate CCoV in different ways and timeframes. At the intensity tested, UV\u2013C light was not sufficient to inactivate the virus after as long as three days.",

In late 2002, an unusual life-threatening respiratory disease, designated as SARS and caused by a novel coronavirus, spread in China (Rota et al., 2003). Rabenau et al. (2005) provided evidence that SARS-CoV is considerably more stable than the previously identified HCoV-229E, demonstrating that in a dried state, SARS-CoV retained residual infectivity even after 6 days, while HCoV-229E completely lost its infectivity within 24 h. Due to the severity of the disease, the contagious nature of the causative agent, and the considerably higher environmental stability of SARS-CoV compared to HCoV-229E, the WHO provided guidelines for working safely and recommended biosafety level 3 (BSL3) as the appropriate containment level for working with live virus (Darnell et al., 2004). Despite the differences in stability during heat treatment at 56 \u00b0C between SARS-CoV and CCoV, the several methods of CCoV inactivation, including inhibition of viral entry, could be applied as animal models to study human coronavirus infection, reducing the risk of accidental exposure to the virus through unsafe laboratory practices.",
