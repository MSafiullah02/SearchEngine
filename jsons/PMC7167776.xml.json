A previous report has described the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure.7 Nested PCR was performed with newly designed primers. Positive samples were also determined using SYBR\u2010Green based real\u2010time PCR, which amplified different regions of the viral genome (Mx3005P Q; Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). Nucleotide sequences of both positive samples were determined by direct sequencing with a sequencing kit (BigDye terminator ver.1.1; Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) using a DNA sequencer (Prism 3100 Avant; Applied Biosystems). PCR was then done for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus (EV) including rhinovirus and coronavirus, hMPV, HBoV, adenovirus (ADV), and parainfluenza virus (PIV) as described in a previous report.7 Bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal specimens was done for all patients.",

In total, 48 (13.9%) were WUPyV (+) and five (1.4%) were KIPyV (+). The peak of WUPyV detection was found to be April\u2013July (Fig. 1). Of the 51 PyV\u2010positive samples, 26 (51.0% of positive samples) were positive for one or more other respiratory tract\u2010associated viruses as follows: HBoV, n = 10; hMPV, n = 7; RSV, n = 5; EV, n = 2; ADV, n = 2; and PIV, n = 2. All KIPyV\u2010positive samples were co\u2010detected with other viruses. Of the remaining 25 patients, 17 patients had complication by bacterial infection, as determined on culture from sputum. In the remaining eight patients (2.3% of 345 patients), specimens were positive only for WUPyV. Among those eight patients (pneumonia, n = 3; bronchitis, n = 5), the most likely symptoms were coughing (100%) and wheezing (89%). High fever (>38.5\u00b0C) was found in three patients (38%). Data related to oxygen saturation (mean, 94%), number of white blood cells (12.4 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), percentage of neutrophils (55%), C\u2010reactive protein (0.73 mg/dL), and length of hospital stay (6.0 days) were similar to those of children with other virus\u2010positive LRTD.",
