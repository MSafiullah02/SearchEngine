Medical store owners can purchase fake drugs from unauthorized dealers and can make a bounty. Another related problem is the reselling of the already sold medicine. This happens when a patient is admitted to the hospital, and the caretakers are told to purchase unnecessary medication [4]. Later those medicines are smuggled back to the drug store, by the staff, in the hospital premises. Consider a Blockchain-based solution, where each drug sachet bears a QR Code that can be scanned through an authorized mobile app. Any customer may check the authenticity of the drug he or she purchases, as the provenance of the drug is traceable. Also, once a drug is sold against a prescription, the same is recorded on a public ledger, making it impossible to resell with a bill.",

Generally, insurance frauds are done in two ways: (1) People get admitted to the hospitals for at least 24 h to claim insurance; however, actually, they are not seriously ill. (2) People hide their old diseases and treatments undergone at the time of buying new health policies, in order to avoid the increased premium cost. If a nation-wide blockchain is prepared that will register the birth, vaccination, medical treatments, and even death registration, the chances to hide pre-existing diseases and treatment would become difficult. Also, the quality of treatment would be improved, as a treating physician would know the historical health-related details of the patient on a mouse click.",

Immigration information is a kind of personal record, which is vulnerable to breach of privacy if caught in the wrong hands; thus, immigration blockchain should be made privately available to only a few identified government authorities, of course, apart from the immigrant. Courier tracking is mostly an internal affair of the logistics company involved and does not have to include other parties invalidating the consignment at every handover stage. Thus, keeping the courier management use case on a private blockchain ought to serve the purpose. Land records application, on the other hand, is made for the public in general, and therefore, using a public blockchain platform.

Endorsers receive transaction requests from clients and either endorse or reject those requests.

Three endorsers (E0, E1, and E2), two committer nodes, and five ordering nodes are used in this experiment.

We assume that immigration checkpoints are located at all international airports, seaports, and roadway borders. Whenever an immigrant enters, their entry is recorded on a public ledger used by all the participating countries. Every such entry is a new transaction requested by the client node. This request goes to the endorsing nodes (see Fig. 1) where smart contracts get executed, and the request is then sent back to the client nodes with an endorsement. By this time, no ledger update takes place. The client then sends the endorsed request to the ordering nodes, where PBFT or No-op algorithm works to assign an existing block or a new block to a transaction. Afterward, the news about the newly created block is broken out to the adjoining peers (committing nodes and endorsers), and all the nodes update their Blockchain accordingly; thus, a consistent ledger is maintained at every participating node. The test network was laid using five computer systems (nodes) reserved for ordering service. Three nodes were designated as endorsing nodes, and two nodes were given the task of committing the transactions on the ledger. Endorsing nodes and committing nodes to maintain their copies of blockchains, which, of course, have to be kept consistent by the consensus algorithms running on the network. Each block was fixed at 20 KB size and can contain ten transactions, roughly. A time limit of 5 min was also assigned to each shaping block; otherwise, a block might have to wait for too long to commit itself in the Blockchain if no new transactions are coming up. The outcome of the discussed exercise is that whenever a foreign visitor or a resident citizen enters into the national territory, the immigration trail of the said person can be verified, and if required, the same person can be quarantined then and there without giving a chance to contract the disease to others.",

In the case of private blockchains, the number of validating nodes (ordering nodes) plays an important part in deciding the performance of the network.
