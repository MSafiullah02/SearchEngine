Even the earliest medical codes of ethics discussed the dispensing drugs as a primary topic for ethical guidance: in the Hippocratic Oath, for example, the clinician vows never to give a person a deadly drug, even if requested, and not to give a woman an abortive remedy. On the other hand, the way drugs were tested and administered before the twentieth century seems almost casual to our eyes today. Prior to the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, for example, there were no consumer regulations about drug development, few research subject protections, and no review bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or institutional review boards. The latter half of the twentieth century, in contrast, has been a time of rapid development of regulations and regulatory bodies to ensure that both clinical research and clinical care conform to ethical and safety standards. Some aspects of that development are surprisingly late: for example, the Common Rule, the set of regulations that covers ethical standards for using human beings as research subjects in all federally funded research, was not finally codified until 1991.",

Drugs are powerful substances with a great capacity to cause harm if misused or overused. Even when used correctly, pharmaceuticals can elicit disputes about their relative harms and benefits in specific situations. The establishment of modern intermediaries \u2013 physicians or pharmacists \u2013 in the allocation of the most powerful drugs increases the potential for conflict between those who control the resource and those who desire access to it. The size and influence of the pharmaceutical\u2013industrial complex places disproportionate power in those whose interests lie in promoting and expanding pharmaceutical use in society. The expense of certain drugs complicates equitable allocation, and the concentration of pharmaceutical power in Western industrialized countries promotes research and drug discovery disproportionately for diseases that are prevalent in the wealthier nations. The increasing sophistication of drug action challenges the traditional model of using drugs as a means to treat pathological conditions and processes, and raises the specter of life style and enhancement uses of pharmaceuticals. New means of drug discovery, such as the use of stem cells, have elicited debate about the relative values placed on the status of the embryo and the potential treatments for intractable conditions that could result from stem cell research. Finally, the overall emphasis on drugs as the first line defense against what ails us has provoked some societal soul-searching: What messages do we want to send to ourselves and our children about how to solve problems and face difficulties in our lives?",

In 1987, the idea emerged that selective inhibitors of COX-2 could relieve inflammatory pain without gastrointestinal side effects. Two large studies of the concept were published in 2000, the Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) and the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR) study. CLASS did not show COX-2 inhibitors to have a gastrointestinal protective effect and researchers believed this was due to the continued use of low-dose aspirin in tested patients. VIGOR prohibited the use of low-dose aspirin, which did indeed reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal lesions, but a serious problem emerged. There was a fivefold higher incidence of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib (Vioxx, Merck) group than in the group treated with naproxen,9 an NSAID.",

While it is much easier to track rare adverse drug reactions after a new drug is introduced into the market, identifying an increased incidence of common events such as heart attack and stroke proves to be more problematic, especially when an adverse event could stem from an underlying disease. Epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular events are often not clear, making it difficult to determine the true risk associated with a particular treatment.9 In the end, it seems that harms are extremely difficult to anticipate or measure in extent until many patients have been exposed. The FDA relies largely on a reactive reporting system, where doctors report possible cases of side effects that they believe to be associated with a drug. Thus, it is extremely difficult to detect dangerous side effects that already commonly occur in a population such as the heart attacks and strokes caused by COX-2 inhibitors.11\n",

Doctors are free to prescribe medicines beyond the confines of labels and they insisted on having access to the drug, despite the side effects, because the label was confusing. By 1996, FDA officials warned the company that reports suggested pediatric patients were at greater risk for cardiac problems. Despite this, the company continued to finance programs that encouraged the drug's pediatric use. When federal officials warned Johnson & Johnson that the drug may have to be banned for children or withdrawn, the government and the company simply negotiated new warnings for the drug's label.

Controversy over the use of SSRIs in youth arose when case reports began to arise in the 1990s indicating a chance of increased suicidal tendencies in patients (mostly adults) undergoing SSRI treatment. In 2003, regulatory agencies in both the US and the UK expressed concern over the treatment of depression in children and adolescents through the use of SSRI treatment and its possible link to increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior for depressed youth under the age of 18.22 The concerns culminated in a 2004 FDA Public Health Advisory warning of the possibility of increased suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents being treated with antidepressant medications.

A study conducted by researchers at the Center for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness at the University College London, the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 Research Unit, and other organizations reevaluated the risk\u2013benefit profile of five SSRIs used in the treatment of depression in youth. The study was based on both published and unpublished trial data on antidepressants including Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil and revealed that increased risk of serious adverse effects and suicide-related events greatly outweighed the benefits of treatment for all the SSRIs except Prozac. The results of this study and several others flew in the face of studies of efficacy and safety based solely on published data, which indicate favorable risk\u2013benefit profiles. In many instances, negative trials were simply never reported.28\n",

Since suicide is rare in children and adolescents, ascertaining whether there is a meaningful increased risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or suicide completion associated with any medication used to treat depression will require review of large numbers of patients.\u201d27 The ACNP Task Force on SSRIs and Suicidal Behavior in Youth is quick to point out that suicidal behavior captured in adverse events reports did not include trials that set out specifically to determine whether medications led to suicidal behavior. Similarly, recent studies reported in JAMA note that the epidemiology of suicidal behavior in persons taking antidepressant drugs is not well documented by formal observational studies.29\n",

In general, the pipeline for new drug introduction is drying up; according to trade publication news, for example, 56 new drugs were introduced in 1996 compared with just 21 new drugs in 2003.

For example, newer approaches to funding the development of necessary drug agents have partnered private and public organizations. In one instance, the pharmaceutical giant Novartis has joined with the government of Singapore to establish the Institute of Tropical Diseases. The Institute's initial goals will entail tackling remedies for dengue fever and drug-resistant tuberculosis.80 Direct donor gifts of philanthropy are also making a difference. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided $168 million in grant funding for treatment and research targeting malaria. Overall, the Gates Foundation has contributed over $3 billion to global health research.81\n",

Clearly, the introduction of atypical antipsychotic agents such as clozapine, risperadone, and ziprasidone (among others) has produced notable improvement in the treatment of mood disorders, some behavioral disorders, and other forms of mental illness.90,91 While these drugs are less likely to cause the involuntary movements that are so problematic with the older antipsychotic drugs, they still have numerous side effects, including chest pain, high blood pressure, agitation, confusion and memory loss, sleep disturbances, and others.

Longer acting (or depot) drugs, which release slowly into the bloodstream after being injected, have recently been introduced. They can help to solve the problem of adherence to regimens in those with mental illness. According to one study, serious mental illness adherence rates are at about 50%.92 The consequences of not adhering to medication include exacerbation, rehospitalization, major disruptions in relationships, loss of employment, and even loss of housing or involvement in the criminal justice system.93 However, depot drugs can also complicate medical decision-making. As there is a large difference in the half-life of some depot medications compared to older medications, it takes longer to eliminate side effects. Administration of long-acting medication changes a patient's timeframe for reversing a treatment decision. Further, long-acting medication can sometimes be used to treat an individual with a mental illness against his or her will. These ethical concerns, as well as the societal value of individual choice, are responsible for the lower than expected use of long-acting antipsychotic medications in the US.94 Similarly, the introduction of surgically implantable medication delivery systems can provide psychiatric patients with uninterrupted access to medication for up to 14 months. Implanted under the skin, these systems can be removed, allowing reversibility. While some patients find such technologies more desirable because they simplify drug-taking, others report feeling controlled by such technologies.95\n",

It is a key factor for all drug treatment, though here we will discuss it in relation to mental illness. The legal basis of the doctrine of informed consent is also a philosophical one, in that persons have a right to privacy and bodily integrity, and that, generally, only the person can decide whether to be treated and in what manner. The issue of competence revolves around an assessment of whether an individual has the mental capacity to make an autonomous decision, to understand the facts, to appreciate the consequences of making a particular decision, and to be consistent in their decision-making about it. Competence, however, is a legal term, and is binary; one is either competent or incompetent. Since the ability to perform a certain action, such as making a decision about medical care, is task-specific, the notion of capacity is preferable to the more global notion of competence. In this sense, even an individual who has been declared legally incompetent with respect to his or her financial affairs, for example, is not necessarily so incapacitated that he or she cannot make a decision about how much medication can comfortably be tolerated. Even when it has been determined that an individual is incapable of making a particular decision, protestations against continuing even indicated, standard treatment (let alone innovative or investigational therapy) should be taken seriously and weighed carefully against the expected benefits and the amount of time required to manifest them. Alternative approaches should be considered under these circumstances, considering likely benefits to the patient and the inherent cost of forced treatment to the patient's well-being. The values underlying informed consent, especially patient self-determination, have also become reference points for identifying acceptable alternatives when a patient lacks the capacity to agree to a treatment or test.",

Such documents are problematic, however, if they require action while a person is still technically competent; if a person is legally competent right now and refusing treatment, by what authority does a document written before have precedence over the individual's decision now?

Impairments of intelligence, attention, and memory can all affect this ability. A third standard is the ability to appreciate the nature of the situation and its likely consequences. The subject must be able to apply the information to his or her own situation. Denial, delusions, and psychotic levels of distortion can all impair this ability.

Patients with schizophrenia or severe depression also had an impaired ability to appreciate the potential value of treatment.101 The MacArthur Treatment Competence Study104 found that subjects with schizophrenia were more likely to completely deny the presence of illness than were depressed patients (35% versus 4%).

Dr Scott Kim and his colleagues write in the American Journal of Psychiatry that more subjects with relatively mild illness will begin to be invited to participate in therapeutic and nontherapeutic Alzheimer's research. Thus, there will likely be a large range in the ability of individuals to give consent, with some \u201cnot capable even while they maintain their \u2018social graces\u2019 and their expressive abilities.\u201d107 In assessing the competency of patients with Alzheimer's disease under various legal standards, researchers have found that even mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease has a significant impact on treatment consent capacity.108 Researchers do, however, reinforce the ethical principle that diagnosis of dementia does not necessarily imply incapacity.109 Therefore, distinguishing capable from incapable Alzheimer's patients remains a considerable challenge.",

Neuroethical inquiry into pharmaceuticals asks under which conditions chemical intervention in mental processes is ethical. What are the implications of using a drug that is developed for the treatment of disease to alter personality or to improve normal human abilities or characteristics? What standards should exist? Will advances in psychopharmacology be used as forms of social control? Might this potentially contribute to a widening gap of social inequality?

Let us take as an example the effort to develop drugs targeted at improving memory in humans.125 The improvement of memory sounds attractive in the abstract, and certainly the development of drugs to boost or enhance memory function is desirable for those suffering from Alzheimer's or other conditions that affect memory. But there are many unknowns in the use of such drugs in the cognitively intact. The assumption is that memory drugs will simply increase the amount of memory we have available, leaving all other cognitive and affective processes unaffected. But in fact, memory is a selective, delicate process. There are experiences and data that the brain filters out, choosing specific kinds of data to remember, while specifically forgetting others. Who needs to remember the hour waiting in a long line at the bank, staring at the ceiling tiles, or to recall the amnesia induced directly after a personal trauma? Will memory enhancement drugs impair our selectivity process? Or might they target and enhance only certain kinds of memories, such as the traumatic or emotional memories, positive and negative, that the brain tends to retain? Might we end up awash in memories that are troubling to us, unable to forget a painful past? And how might a memory drug affect associated mental processes \u2013 such as mood (which is closely connected to memory) or attentiveness (daydreaming is often fueled by a sudden recollection)? Perhaps evolution has stabilized at a particular level of memory capacity because any additional capacity would sacrifice a certain cognitive flexibility, a plastic brain may have advantages over one crammed with memory.122\n",

The mice also displayed physiological changes in the hippocampus (associated with learning) when compared to nontransgenic mice. However, subsequent research demonstrated that the mice with enhanced NR2B seemed to have a greater sensitivity to pain.127 The original creators of the mice argued the mice may not feel the pain more acutely, but simply learn about pain more readily and thus seem to react more strongly. Still, it is troubling that even the most preliminary research on memory enhancement has already raised the question of whether enhancing memory might have unexpected collateral effects. Perhaps there is a link we do not understand between memory and pain, either at the structural or behavioral level. What other unexpected linkages might be discovered in attempts to change cognitive functions through induced physiological modification?",

While the use of stimulants to improve children's behavior was used as far back as the 1930s,142 alarm has been raised at the rapid increase in diagnosis prescription rates. From 1990 to 1995, the annual US production of Ritalin increased fivefold, far exceeding that of any other country. By the late 1990s, the US was producing and consuming 90% of the world's Ritalin.143 Concern over the use of drugs in small children led to widespread media and medical attention. A general perception arose that ADHD was overdiagnosed and stimulants overprescribed. Others have argued, in contrast, that the trends reflect better diagnosis, more effective treatment, and increased education and recognition of the syndrome.144\n",

For the US federally funded Medicare program, as well as for national health plans in other developed countries such as the UK, pharmaceuticals that some could construe as primarily life style drugs are often covered by insurance. Examples include drugs for erectile dysfunction, menopausal symptoms, smoking cessation, and birth control. It is not the intention here to trivialize these conditions by giving them a life style classification, nevertheless, it can be argued that they are outside the realm of pathology as classically defined. They do, however, bring into question the challenge of allocating scarce national (economic) healthcare resources intended for medical necessity. While rationing may not be the preferred method of allocating healthcare dollars, funds that support research, development, and distribution of pharmaceutical agents for anything less than medical need increase the challenges for government and employer-based funding.116 A number of states (Washington, New Jersey, Illinois) in the US are currently considering imposing a vanity tax on cosmetic surgery and Botox injections \u2013 another indication that such pharmaceutical agents are viewed as not only elective in nature, but also unrelated to health matters requiring curative or medical care.",

Despite major advances in drug therapy for many diseases, treatment remains suboptimal for a significant proportion of individuals because of unpredictable side effects or lack of response.

There exists an ongoing discussion over this precise question.159 The recent development of ethnically targeted therapies has reopened the controversial debate over pharmacogenomics and race. BiDil, a new drug treatment for heart failure tested solely in one racial group, recently became the first drug to be approved by the FDA to treat heart failure in African-Americans only.160, 161, 162 NitroMed began the African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) in 2001, the first ever heart failure trial to be comprised solely of African-American patients. The study claimed that \u201cobserved racial disparities in mortality and therapeutic response rates in Black heart failure patients may be due in part to ethnic differences in the underlying pathophysiology of heart failure.\u201d163,164 This raises some important questions. Are there significant genetic differences between ethnic and racial groups? How good are current racial labels as indicators of genetics differences? Should these classifications even be used in this manner? It is possible that developments like these can breed discrimination and racism, reinforcing \u201cdiscredited crude biological notions of race,\u201d165 with whole population groups becoming stigmatized.166 Historically, clinical decisions based on ethnic or racial classification often leads to poor or ineffective care.167\n",

The use of pharmaceuticals to cure a variety of ills is one of the great success stories of human technology, and has resulted in symptom relief and cures that were scarcely imagined by our forebears. In order to continue developing and using drugs as they increase in strength and specificity, it is important to clearly define the ethical basis of proper drug use and the pitfalls of our current means of creating and distributing them. To do so is to ensure continued development for the health and well-being of future generations.",
