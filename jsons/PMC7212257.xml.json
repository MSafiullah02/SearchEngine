Actually, if both aged groups were combined together and analyzed as a whole, MALFD subjects had a high likelihood of severe disease when compared with non-MAFLD subjects (26.9% vs 14.5% p =0.004). If multivariate analysis had been performed with the whole cohort, there was a high likelihood that MAFLD would be an independent factor for severe COVID-19, similarly to our observations.2\n",
