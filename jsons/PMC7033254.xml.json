Corticosteroids could improve the lung tissue damage induced by influenza pneumonia and decrease the risk of mortality in animal models with influenza infections6,7. Many clinicians administer corticosteroids as an anti-inflammatory treatment for patients with severe influenza-related pneumonia to stop disease progression and improve clinical outcomes. A large cohort study of patients admitted to 148 ICUs in Spain found that the frequency of corticosteroid treatment by study period was 34.9% in 2009, 39.6% in 2010, 29% in 2013, and 31.4% in 20148. Recently, some studies have shown that corticosteroids may not be beneficial for patients with severe influenza and may even increase mortality9\u201311. However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding whether patients with influenza-related ARDS or severe pneumonia can benefit from adjuvant corticosteroid therapy.",

The risk of bias identified in the 19 included studies is shown in Supplementary Tables S4a,b. The studies\u2019 NOS scores varied from 6 to 9, indicating that the quality of the included studies was high22. However, most included studies had substantial comparability bias because we could not adequately adjust for disease severity, and individuals with greater diseases severity tended to use corticosteroids.",

First, most studies did not adjust the clinical outcomes for potential confounding factors. Clinically, more severe cases tended to be treated with corticosteroids, which may obscure the real value of this treatment regarding mortality30,31. Therefore, in this study, we preferred the use of adjusted estimates of the effect to minimize potential confounding between the treatment groups. However, five studies reported adjusted estimates of mortality, and their inclusion in the meta-analysis still revealed a higher odds of mortality related to steroids use. Good evidences indicated that secondary bacterial pneumonia is an important cause of mortality related to influenza32,33. Therefore, increasing risk of nosocomial infection due to corticosteroid treatment may partly account for the potential harm from corticosteroid use. Two included studies8,15 found that secondary bacterial pneumonia such as due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus or invasive fungal infection, were more common in corticosteroid-treated patients. Several studies showed that prolonged viral shedding and delayed viral clearance were noted in corticosteroid-treated patients10,34, whereas slower clearance of virus loads was associated with higher mortality in patients with ARDS due to H1N1pdm09 virus infection35. Thus, prolonged viral shedding and delayed viral clearance may also contribute to higher mortality.",

In order to minimize the influences of different indications, subgroup analysis of the mortality in three studies (n = 3347) was performed after excluding patients receiving corticosteroids as rescue therapy or due to COPD/asthma exacerbation, and found no statistically significant difference between the steroid therapy groups and control groups and the heterogeneity was high (I\u00b2 = 77%).

            "text": "The results from clinical studies of corticosteroid therapy in patients with influenza are conflicting. Many studies have shown a significant association between corticosteroid treatment and mortality in patients with influenza; however, several studies have reported that corticosteroids can provide benefits to patients under certain conditions15,28,39,40. An RCT13 included in this review noted an association between adjuvant corticosteroid therapy (50 mg of prednisone given orally for 7 days) and decreased time to clinical stability. Low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids are beneficial in people with hypoxia ((PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg), whereas high doses of corticosteroids showed no benefit in this group; however, low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids may increase the 60-day mortality rate in those with PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg15. Kil et al.28 reported that rapid (methylprednisolone, 10 mg/kg/d) and short-term (tapered off within a week) corticosteroid treatment for children with severe pneumonia halted clinical exacerbation and possibly prevented progression to ARDS. However, in another study, compared with no treatment, administration (steroid therapy was initiated at a median daily dose equivalent to 270 (IQR, 200\u2013400) mg of hydrocortisone, and a median duration of 11 (IQR, 6\u201320) days within the first 3 days of MV was more strongly associated with an increased risk of death, whereas when administration was beyond the first 3 days of MV, the association was no longer significant14. Considering the findings of the aforementioned studies, the condition of the patients\u2019 respiratory system and the dose, timing and duration of corticosteroids could be contributing factors that affect the effects of corticosteroids.",

There is insufficient evidence in this meta-analysis to make a firm determination about the effectiveness of corticosteroids for people with influenza-related pneumonia or ARDS. The small number of included studies and the small number of patients in the included studies might also make the effect size of some outcome indicators insufficient, and we were unable to analyse the effect of some factors on the outcome indicators by meta-regression or subgroup analysis.",
