Hippocrates was perhaps the first physician to suspect the presence of air in the pleural space in one of his patients, but it was in 1803 that the term pneumothorax was used for the first time.1 Although Laennec2 gave the first clinical description of pneumothorax in 1819, it was not until 1901 that this entity was demonstrated on a chest radiograph published in the Lancet.3 In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, pneumothoraces were believed to be the result of tuberculosis. This belief was laid to rest when Kjaergaard,4 in 1932, described the occurrence of this condition in otherwise healthy young adults. Definitive therapy for the condition became available with the advent of tube thoracostomy, employed by Hewett in 1876.5\n",

Smit and colleagues20 performed spirometrically controlled high-resolution CT density measurements in 41 patients with SP and found that the mean lung density was lower in patients with pneumothorax.

The occurrence of recurrent SP in a Finnish brother and his sisters also raises the possibility of autosomal recessive inheritance.23 As in SP, patients with Marfan syndrome are tall, and pneumothorax is a common pulmonary complication. Marfan syndrome is caused by the mutation in the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15. This gene is responsible for the formation of 10- to 12-nm microfibrils in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue. Cardy and colleagues24 hypothesized that familial SP is caused by a connective tissue disorder that exhibits mendelian inheritance and postulated FBN1 as the causative gene. Another interesting syndrome in which patients develop SP has been described. Brit-Hogg-Dube (BHD) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome characterized by benign skin and renal tumors, pleuropulmonary blebs and cysts, and SP. The gene has been mapped to chromosome 17p11.2 and recently identified, expressing a novel protein called folliculin.25, 26\n",

It has been suggested that the greater prevalence of SP in tall, thin males is the result of a combination of circumstances. In an extremely long and narrow chest, the apical alveoli are underperfused; such alveoli are more readily torn by gravitational stress. Inherited weakness of connective tissue might also contribute to the pathogenesis, as suggested by the numerous reports of SP in families and concurrent occurrence of SP in twins.35 Morrison and colleagues36 have reported a family exhibiting spontaneous pneumothorax in a father and three offspring and suggested that isolated autosomal dominant pneumothorax may be a distinct entity.",

This has been attributed to poor distribution of the aerosolized pentamidine at the periphery of the lung, which allows the development of a peripheral necrotizing pneumonitis, producing a bronchopleural fistula with resultant pneumothorax.58 Alternately, an ongoing acute infection in inadequately treated areas may eventually result in cystic dilation of distal airway.55 Martinez and colleagues51 have suggested that the sulfite in the isethionate component of the aerosol may cause an irritant cough, resulting in a rupture of the cysts. It has been found that low diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide before pentamidine therapy for secondary prophylaxis is associated with an increased risk of bilateral pneumothoraces and increased mortality in these patients.60\n",

Alifano and colleagues71 described 32 women with spontaneous pneumothorax who had been referred for surgical treatment. In eight cases (25%), the catamenial character of the pneumothorax was recognized by clinical history. In all eight cases, the pneumothorax was recurrent (one to four previous episodes) and right sided. A diaphragmatic abnormality was found in all eight cases. Two mechanisms have been described for pneumothorax related to endometriosis. The most common is the movement of endometrial implants to the diaphragm, preferentially to the right side because of the recognized peritoneal circulation up from the pelvis to the right side. These implants then create channels or \u201choles\u201d through the diaphragm that allow the implants or air to move into the chest. The second and much less frequent cause of endometrial implants in the chest is through the venous implants that lodge in the lung itself.72 Clinical manifestations of thoracic endometriosis include chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Bilateral pneumothoraces and concurrent hemothorax, hemoptysis, chest pain, and pneumothorax have been described.73\n",

An early radiologic feature and a harbinger of life-threatening barotrauma is the presence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema manifests radiologically as small parenchymal cysts, circular cuffs around larger pulmonary vessels projected end-on (perivascular halos), small dots representing small peripheral vessels surrounded by areas of radiolucency, linear streaks of air radiating toward the hilum, and large cystic collections of air and subpleural air.92, 93 The air, having entered the interstitium, then dissects proximally along bronchovascular sheaths toward the lung hilum and mediastinum. Once in the mediastinum, the accumulated air takes the path of least resistance and may produce subcutaneous emphysema, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum, or retroperitoneum (Fig. 48-2\n). If the mediastinal pressure rises abruptly or if decompression via these routes is not sufficient, the mediastinal parietal pleura may rupture, resulting in pneumothorax. Entry of gas into the pulmonary circulation may produce systemic air embolism.94 Even pneumoscrotum has been described as an unusual complication of barotrauma.95 Pneumomediastinum can produce several interesting radiographic signs such as pneumopericardium, continuous diaphragm sign, continuous left hemidiaphragm sign, Naclerio's sign, V sign at confluence of brachiocephalic veins, thymic spinnaker-sail sign, ring-round-the-artery sign, and extrapleural sign.96\n",

In a study published in June 2006, Izbicki and colleagues108 also concluded that in asymptomatic patients, routine radiograph after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary. When biopsies are performed, the following groups of patients should be considered for postbronchoscopy radiograph: comatose or mentally retarded patients, patients receiving positive-pressure ventilation, patients with severe respiratory compromise as a result of disease or surgery, patients with bullous disease, patients who complain of chest pain, and outpatients.

Delayed pneumothorax after percutaneous fine needle aspiration, although extremely unusual, has been reported in two cases and patients should be warned of this possible complication.118 More recently, Choi and colleagues119 reported on their series of 458 patients who had undergone transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB).

Age, sex, underlying lung condition, overall clinical condition, size of the effusion, and type of tap (diagnostic or therapeutic) had no significant effect on the occurrence of pneumothorax after thoracentesis. In a recent review article, Feller-Kopman127 concluded that the use of ultrasound for thoracentesis has been associated with improved yield and reduced complication rate and is quickly becoming the standard of care for procedural guidance.",

Normally, to confirm the correct placement of a feeding tube in the stomach, a small amount of air is injected. This produces a characteristic gurgle in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, but a \u201cpseudoconfirmatory gurgle\u201d with a feeding tube in the chest has been reported.133 Aspiration of large amounts of fluid through the tube is also taken to be a test of correct placement into the stomach, but delayed aspiration of a large quantity of undigested enteral feeding solution from the pleural space, mistaken for gastric contents, has been reported.132\n",

Acute lobar collapse results in a sudden increase in negative pleural pressure surrounding the collapsed lobe. Although the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces remain intact, the gas originating from the ambient tissues and blood is drawn into the pleural space, producing a pneumothorax called pneumothorax ex vacuo. Recognition of this type of pneumothorax is crucial because managing it requires relieving the bronchial obstruction rather than inserting a chest tube. The diagnosis of trapped lung requires documentation of chronicity and absence of pleural inflammation, pleural malignancy, or endobronchial lesion. The pathognomonic radiographic sign of a trapped lung is the pneumothorax ex vacuo, characterized as a small to moderate-sized air collection after evacuation of effusion.145\n",

Tetzlaff and colleagues149 found that preexisting small lung cysts or end-expiratory flow limitation may increase the risk of PBT, although Neuman and colleagues150 contested these conclusions.

Because of a ball-valve mechanism, air enters the pleural cavity but cannot escape, thereby building up positive pressure. As the tension continues to increase, the diaphragm is flattened, the mediastinum is shifted to the opposite side, and ultimately cardiopulmonary collapse results.

A unilateral thoracic procedure in this situation has been described to cause bilateral pneumothoraces171, 172 and \u201cshifting pneumothorax.\u201d173 Johri and colleagues174 reported a patient who had undergone a thymoma resection in the remote past and developed bilateral pneumothoraces after undergoing transthoracic needle biopsy of a right lung nodule.

Air leaks or recurrences occurred in all four patients who accepted chest tubes. These air leaks took 14 to 31 days to resolve. Peripheral leukocytes and serum lactate dehydrogenase were higher in SARS patients with pneumothorax. These complications reflected severe pathologic changes in lung tissues and the strong pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses that accompany SARS. During the SARS epidemic, health care providers were at risk, with substantial risk for those who performed bronchoscopy. By the end of the epidemic, approximately 30% of reported cases were in health care workers and some died.

            "text": "A persistent pulmonary air leak, which may occur as a result of pneumothorax or after pulmonary resection, is a difficult and frustrating problem to manage. Conventionally, the air leak persisting for more than 7 days is called bronchopleural fistula and it is not an uncommon problem. In the series reported by Chee and colleagues,254 the overall incidence of bronchopleural fistula was 34.6%. In pulmonary resection cases, Cerfolio and colleagues,255 on univariate analysis, found that the increased age and the following findings on pulmonary function testing predicted air leak on postoperative day one: low forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC), increased residual volume/total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC), increased RV, and increased functional residual capacity (FRC). In the patients with air leaks who are managed by tube thoracostomy, Cerfolio and colleagues255 found that conversion from suction to a water seal is an effective way of sealing an expiratory air leak. If the leak persists beyond 7 days, tube thoracostomy is deemed to have failed and a more definitive treatment is planned. Such cases are usually managed surgically, but patients who are unfit or unwilling for surgery pose a management dilemma. Chemical pleurodesis may be tried but does not succeed if the lung has failed to expand. In such a situation, autologous \u201cblood patch\u201d pleurodesis has been found useful.256, 257 Kinoshita and colleagues258 have described a technique for such cases. They used a large amount of diluted fibrin glue for pleurodesis in patients with intractable pneumothorax or intrapleural dead space and found it useful. If pleurodesis also fails, the leak is localized during fiberoptic bronchoscopy and the fistula is sealed by using a sealant.259 Pectoral myoplasty, in which the right pectoralis major muscle was transferred into the thorax and draped over the area of lung with multiple leaks, has been used when other interventions fail.260 Murata and colleagues261 have described a closure with intravenous administration of a coagulation factor XIII concentrate. Ferguson and colleagues262 reported closure of a persistent distal bronchopleural fistula using a one-way endobronchial valve designed for the treatment of emphysema.",

Since that time, unilateral expansion pulmonary edema has been recognized as a complication that can occur during the management of pneumothorax (Fig. 48-6\n). Reexpansion pulmonary edema tends to occur with greater frequency in patients 20 to 39 years of age, when there is complete collapse of the lung, when the pneumothorax has remained untreated for more than 72 hours, and when rapid reexpansion occurs secondary to the application of negative pressure; age-related changes in the older patients seem to afford some protection.214, 264 The exact pathogenesis of reexpansion pulmonary edema is not known, but various factors such as bronchial obstruction,265 decrease in surfactant,266 and increased capillary permeability267, 268 have been implicated. The development of bilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema after unilateral pleurodesis in a young male without heart disease might suggest that forces leading to ipsilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema also affect the contralateral lung.269\n",

A lateral view or a lateral decubitus film should be performed if the posteroanterior (PA) view is normal and the suspicion for pneumothorax is high. BTS guidelines recommend CT scan to differentiate a pneumothorax from complex lung disease, when aberrant tube placement is suspected, and when plain radiograph is obscured by surgical emphysema. The ACCP panel did not achieve consensus regarding the role of CT.\nManagement of chest tubes: Some controversy exists regarding the size of the tube in various situations and the use of suction. According to BTS, there is no evidence that large tubes (20 to 24 French [Fr]) are any better than smaller tubes (10 to 14 Fr) in the management of pneumothorax. However, a small chest tube may need to be replaced by a larger tube if leaking persists and creates management difficulty.\n",

Rupture of these bullae is not related to physical activity but may be related to changes in atmospheric pressure. COPD is the most common cause of secondary pneumothorax. Presentation of pneumothorax in COPD is often atypical and causes excessive morbidity and mortality.\u25aaA high incidence of pneumothorax occurs in AIDS patients, related to PCP and the mechanical ventilation and bronchoscopy that are commonly required in these patients. In this group of patients, pneumothorax is frequently bilateral, recurrent, and unresponsive to conservative therapy.\u25aaTraumatic pneumothorax, which occurs as a result of a penetrating injury, may occur with closed chest trauma.\u25aaPTX is a common complication of mechanical ventilation. Interstitial emphysema is a harbinger of this complication. High peak and mean airway pressures, PEEP, use of volume-cycled ventilators, intubation of right mainstem bronchus, chronic airways obstruction, and aspiration pneumonia increase the incidence.\u25aaPneumothorax ex vacuo, sports-related pneumothorax, and barotrauma unrelated to mechanical ventilation are interesting conditions that are not common, but they are important to be aware of.\u25aaSimultaneous bilateral pneumothoraces and \u201cshifting pneumothoraces\u201d are rare but interesting conditions and may develop because of persistent pleuro-pleural communication called iatrogenic buffalo chest.\n\u25aaAn immediate postbronchoscopy chest radiograph is rarely useful but should be done in certain groups of patients (e.g., comatose, mentally retarded, ventilated, or with respiratory compromise).\u25aaPTX induced by a misplaced small-bore feeding tube is not uncommon. Clinical signs may be misleading.\u25aaA visceral pleural line with absence of lung markings peripherally is the classic radiographic sign of PTX. When the chest radiograph is obtained in the supine position, the signs are very different.\u25aaThe approach to management of a PTX is dictated by the clinical condition rather than merely the size of the PTX, which is best estimated by CT scan of the chest. Expectant therapy is recommended for a small PSP in a stable patient. Reabsorption of air is hastened by 100% oxygen.\u25aaAir can be removed by simple aspiration, a small lumen catheter, or tube thoracostomy. Unstable patients with large secondary PTXs must be managed with tube thoracostomy.\u25aaA staged approach is recommended for chest tube removal. In PSP cases, the tube can be removed 6 to 12 hours after evidence of air leak was last seen; this waiting period is 12 to 24 hours in secondary PTX.\u25aaDefinitive management of recurrent pneumothorax or persistent leak can be done by open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopy associated with pleurodesis, pleural abrasion, parietal pleurectomy, or bullectomy. In patients unsuitable or unwilling for surgery, chemical pleurodesis via a chest tube may be done.\u25aaPTX tends to recur in patients with cystic fibrosis. Blebectomy, without stripping the pleura, is recommended in these patients so that they may remain transplant candidates. Pleurodesis should not be done in these cases because adhesion development jeopardizes subsequent lung transplantation.\u25aaPTX in pregnancy is managed in the usual manner initially. In view of the high recurrence rates during parturition, thoracotomy with resection of blebs should be considered.\u25aaReexpansion pulmonary edema is an important complication and can be prevented by slow expansion in high-risk patients.\n\n",
