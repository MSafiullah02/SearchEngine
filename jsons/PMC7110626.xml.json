            "text": "The retro-orbital plexus has been a very reliable site for blood collection.4., 6. Retro-orbital bleeds should be conducted under anesthesia to avoid potential inadvertent trauma. The rodent head should be stabilized at the base of the skull and at the point of the jaw. Thumb depression on the jugular vein may assist in collection by distending the plexus. The index finger should retract the dorsal lid of the eye. A slight exophthalmos facilitates the approach under the globe. The collection-site approach and the collection device depend on the rodent. For mice and gerbils, a microcapillary tube or small-bore Pasteur pipette is gently inserted at the medial canthus (\nFig. 2). With gentle pressure, the clinician advances the tube by either rocking or rotating the tube until the conjunctiva is punctured and the orbital venous sinus plexus is penetrated. Slightly withdrawing the tube after first entry into the plexus may increase blood flow. The blood fills the tube by capillary action. When the tube is removed, apply pressure over the eye. Be careful not to traumatize the contralateral eye; 0.5 mL may be collected from a healthy adult mouse in this manner. The approach for retro-orbital bleeding varies amongst rodent species because of differences in the orbital venous. In the hamster approach, the tube should be inserted midway along the superior border of the eye and advanced to the plexus located posterior to the globe (\nFig. 3).33 In the rat, the venous plexus lies deep in the orbit. Although it is possible to use the lateral or the medial canthus approach, the medial canthus is largely occupied by the Harderian gland and has only small veins and not a plexus. The middorsal approach, as illustrated in Figure 3, is the most direct approach to the dorsal anastomotic vein in the rat.36 Application of ophthalmic ointment after retro-orbital bleeds is not suggested and may be harmful because of overgrooming by the rodent.",

The mouse is restrained in a tube such as a 35-mL syringe. The clinician extends the leg and holds it in place by holding the skin between the tail and the thigh. This step is the key to success with this technique because the location of the vein varies, depending on how the skin is held. The area is prepared and the vein can be seen on the surface of the thigh. A 23-gauge needle is used to puncture, not lance, the vein, and blood will flow. Blood may be collected into a microhematocrit tube or other blood capillary collection device. Pressure is applied to the site with gauze, and the bleeding stops. The scab that forms can be removed and additional blood samples collected. Several collections can be obtained over the course of the day.

A 25-gauge \u00d7 3/8-in butterfly catheter is attached to a 1-mL syringe. It is inserted 1 mm medial to the border of the auditory bulla. When the operator pierces the skin, an assistant begins to aspirate. To penetrate the sinus, the operator should insert the needle only 1 to 2 mm beneath the skin. The angle of the needle may be adjusted to obtain good blood flow into the syringe. This procedure looks more intimidating than it is. It is less risky than a CNS tap.

Evaluating the individual rodent patient relies on the normal values against which an individual patient could be assessed. Normal variations in the hematology and clinical biochemistry of rodents occur owing to a variety of things, including age, sex, strain, diet, restraint, anesthesia, circadian effects, housing method, latent infections, bleeding site, and handling methods. Each of these factors affects the results. Some species exhibit seasonal effects, especially species which estivate or hibernate, like the hamster.22., 37. In addition to these variables, the laboratory processing the samples should be considered when selecting the reference values and ranges to be used for interpreting diagnostic test results. The volume required for standard panels may not be available, and the clinician must identify the critical tests to be run when sample volume is limited.",

Regeneration of RBCs may result in an increased reticulocyte count or basophilic stippling. However, in rodents, especially the gerbils, the short RBC life span leads to a high percentage of RBC basophilic stippling and a high reticulocyte count. Newborn gerbils have as much as 40% basophilic stippling, whereas newborn rats have 12% to 15% basophilic stippling. Rats have 16% reticulocytes at birth; this decreases to 2.5% reticulocytes as adults. Hamsters have 10% to 30% nucleate RBC, whereas the adult hamster has less than 2%.15 In general, hemoglobin and hematocrit values are lower in the newborn rodent (mouse, rat, guinea pig, gerbil) than in the adult animal. This is different than in most mammals, including the human. Gender-associated differences have been reported for RBC counts in the rat, the chinchilla, and the gerbil.7., 15., 21.
