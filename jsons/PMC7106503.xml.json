DAAs, which target specific steps of virus replication, and vaccines, are currently the most effective therapeutic intervention strategies used against virus infections. Newly emerging or re-emerging viruses that have undergone mutations may, however, be resistant to the effects of DAAs, whereas vaccines require that the virus strain be identified before vaccine production, precluding their use at the onset of any new virus infection outbreak. Broad-spectrum antivirals, capable of modulating the innate immune response regardless of the infecting virus, present as ideal candidates as a first-line treatment for acute virus infections such as respiratory tract or sexually transmitted infections.",

            "text": "IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 are produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and are critical effectors in an innate immune response to virus infections [1]. IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 are induced following pattern recognition receptor (PRR) activation by viruses (Box 1\n, as reviewed in [2]) and target many different stages of viral replication: for example, viral entry, envelope uncoating, genome replication, protein assembly, and release of viral progeny 3, 4. IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 also activate different cell types in the immune system to promote viral clearance and induce apoptosis of cells to prevent viral replication 1, 3. As host-derived innate immune response factors, IFNs are, therefore, broad-spectrum antivirals, crucial for the primary host response to viral infection.Box 1IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction by viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)PRRs, including membrane-associated Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and cytosolic RNA and DNA sensors such as RIG-I, are able to detect both extracellular, endosomal or cytosolic viral PAMPs: viral genomic material. The primary outcome of this nonspecific surveillance system that detects any and all viruses, regardless of the target cell or tissue tropism of the virus, and independent of where the virus is located, is the transcriptional activation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes and the rapid production and secretion of these IFNs. Upon viral PAMP recognition, PRRs are able to trigger a phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascade to activate IRF3 and/or IRF7. For instance, endosomal RNA/DNA-sensing TLR7 and TLR9 activate IRF7 via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), whereas endosomal dsRNA-binding TLR3 and RIG-I, are able to activate IRF3 and IRF7 through TBK1 and inhibitor of IKK\u025b. IRF3 and IRF7 activation results in their nuclear translocation where they act as transcription factors and up-regulate IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene expression.",

Successful viral clearance is determined by the balance between virus-encoded molecules that antagonize the host innate immune response and the robustness of the host innate immune response. Here, we discuss how IFN therapy presents as a viable treatment option for a range of acute virus infections that target a variety of tissues, including respiratory tract infections by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza A viruses, infections of the liver by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), and mucosal infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV).

            "text": "The SARS-CoV outbreak originated in Hong Kong in late 2002\u20132003 and resulted in >8000 cases of disease worldwide, with a 9.6% mortality rate between November 2002 and July 2003 (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html). SARS-CoV is a single-stranded RNA virus that encodes in its genome virulence factors that antagonize the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response. In infected host cells, SARS-CoV expresses the nonstructural protein (Nsp) 1 and Nsp3. Nsp1 suppresses host gene expression by disrupting mRNA translation and by upregulating mRNA degradation 14, 22. Immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter studies have shown that Nsp1 directly associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit to inhibit its translational activity [22]. In addition, the Nsp1\u201340S complex is able to modify mature 5\u2032-capped RNAs to limit translation and promote degradation [22]. In the context of an IFN response, these antagonistic mechanisms of Nsp1 on host gene expression and protein synthesis inhibit IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression and production [14]. In vitro, Nsp1 also inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 protein phosphorylation induced by IFN-\u03b1 treatment [23]. Both Nsp1 and Nsp3 inhibit interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7 activation to downregulate IFN production in response to viral infection 23, 24. Specifically, Nsp3 inhibits IRF3 in human bronchial epithelial cells via its papain-like protease (PLP) domain, which interacts with IRF3 to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [24]. In addition to Nsp1 and Nsp3, the open reading frame 6 (ORF6) and matrix (M) proteins of the SARS-CoV also inhibit an IFN response 19, 25. ORF6 localizes to the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and blocks the transcription factor function of phosphorylated STAT1, by binding to nuclear import factors to prevent its translocation to the nucleus [19]. The M protein interacts with RNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), an RNA helicase and key intracellular PRR associated with induction of IRF-dependent IFN production following detection of viral RNAs. The M protein also interacts with the signaling effectors serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (TBK1), inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB kinase subunit \u025b (IKK\u025b), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), again associated with IFN gene induction [25]. Thus, there are multiple mechanisms by which SARS-CoV might inhibit the host IFN response. The implications are that an IFN response to SARS-CoV infection must be dramatically limited for virus replication to proceed, suggesting that the dominant immune response is the IFN response.",

In vitro studies to examine the mechanism of action of IFN against the SARS-CoV have revealed that IFN-inducible Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), protein kinase C (PKC)-\u03b4 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation mediate IFN antiviral protection. Target genes downstream of activation of these kinases are differentially expressed in the peripheral blood cells of SARS patients treated with IFN alfacon-1 compared with patients not treated with IFN, and functionally these genes are associated with antimicrobial activity [47]. Treatment of a human bronchial epithelial cell line, Calu-3, with IFN alfacon-1 before infection with the SARS-CoV results in inhibition of virus infection and a reduction in overall virus yield, further supporting the idea that IFN alfacon-1 demonstrates antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV [40]. These data demonstrate that despite the inherent ability of the SARS-CoV to inhibit IFN production and limit an IFN response, treatment with exogenous IFN-\u03b1 overrides these inhibitory effects. These results support the further evaluation of IFN alfacon-1 as a first-line treatment for acute SARS-CoV infection and approved randomized clinical trial protocols are in place in the USA and Canada should there be outbreaks of SARS-CoV.",

Vaccines, however, are not relevant during an outbreak involving an emergent variant. The 2009 H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus is a prime example of how quickly a pandemic can develop given the potential for genetic shift and mutation of influenza A viruses among natural hosts. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, DAAs such as the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir were widely used before a vaccine became available [48]. Not surprisingly, however, DAA-resistant variants of pandemic H1N1 emerged 48, 49. Avian H5N1 influenza virus outbreaks, now affecting populations throughout Asia and Europe, are associated with mortality rates around 60% [50]. Notably, a number of H5N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir [51]. To date, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission of this lethal H5N1 influenza virus infection, but if a newly emerging strain capable of human-to-human transmission appears, DAA resistance will develop and until a vaccine becomes available \u2013 probably 4\u20136 months \u2013 populations will be at risk in the absence of access to broad-spectrum antivirals.",

            "text": "NS1 is the primary virulence factor encoded by influenza A viruses and it is expressed in host cells during the earliest stages of infection [15]. In comparison with SARS-CoV Nsp1, influenza virus NS1 has both overlapping functions as well as unique mechanisms to inhibit the IFN response. NS1 acts both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of an infected cell, and is the primary antagonist of the host innate immune response. Remarkably, NS1 has evolved to inhibit virtually all stages of the IFN response to virus infection, including inhibition of IFN production, interference with IFN signaling events, and inhibiting the function of antiviral factors induced by IFN signaling. NS1 inhibits the activity of RIG-I (Box 1) where the NS1 dsRNA-binding domain interacts directly with RIG-I [15]. Within the nucleus of an infected cell, NS1 inhibits the processing and synthesis of host mRNAs, including IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNAs, by binding to and inhibiting both cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 30 kDa (CPSF30) and poly(A)-binding protein II (PABPII), via its protein-binding domain [15]. The expression of avian H5N1 NS1 disrupts IFN signaling events by downregulating the surface expression of one of the IFNAR subunits, IFNAR1, and by upregulating SOCS1 protein expression, leading to a reduction in IFN-inducible STAT phosphorylation and STAT homo/heterodimer nuclear translocation [20]. NS1 is able to block directly the antiviral activities of IFN-inducible antiviral proteins such as protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) and 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS/RNaseL, via its protein-binding domain and dsRNA-binding domain, respectively [15]. The Src homology 2 (SH2)-binding domain within the protein-binding region of NS1 permits interaction with the internal SH2 domain of p85\u03b2, the inhibitory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This leads to activation of the PI3K\u2013AKT pathway [15]. Activation of PI3K, a downstream target of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, by a specific NS1 promotes cell survival during the early stages of infection, illustrating the complex interplay between virus encoded factors and the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response [15]. Remarkably, distinct highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, namely influenza viruses and the SARS-CoV, encode nonstructural proteins in their genomes that function as virulence factors that specifically target the host innate IFN response, further emphasizing the importance of IFNs as broad-spectrum antivirals.",

Subjects receiving rIFN-\u03b1 had lower concentrations of serum IgM specific for H3N2 influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus (species B), and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 [52]. Specifically with regard to influenza A virus, only 30 recruits treated with rIFN-\u03b1 had detectable levels of influenza A virus IgM compared with 104 recruits in the untreated control group [52]. No adverse events were reported in the treatment group, the data demonstrating that IFN was well tolerated and was effective in preventing a variety of common viral respiratory infections.

            "text": "The incomplete response to IFN treatment is partially attributable to virally encoded virulence factors that interfere with an IFN response: NS3/4A and NS5A. NS3/4A is an HCV serine protease that targets mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) proteins required for RIG-I-mediated IRF3 activation and subsequent IFN production [16]. Recently, the secondary structure of the HCV genotype 1b NS3 N-terminal region was identified as a predictive marker for the virological response in patients who had received IFN and ribavirin combination therapy for 48 weeks. Specifically, polymorphisms in the secondary structure of the NS3 amino-terminal region segregate HCV genotype 1b infected individuals into two groups and are predictive of the virological response to peg-IFN plus ribavirin therapy [54]. NS5A associates with intracellular membranes and its expression is vital for HCV genome replication. NS5A is able to interact with IFN-inducible PKR to evade an IFN-induced antiviral response. Polymorphisms in amino acid residues 70 and 91 in the HCV core and in NS5A are also predictive markers of the virological response in patients receiving IFN and ribavirin therapy [55]. Notably, NS5A is a target of IFN, because the IFN-activated gene 15 (IFI15)/interferon stimulated gene (ISG15) encoding a 17-kDa protein, promotes ISGylation of NS5A to enhance its degradation, thereby inhibiting HCV replication [56].",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which HBV evades an innate immune response are less well understood. The HBV polymerase (Pol) blocks IRF signaling and subsequent IFN production by inhibiting TBK1/IKK\u025b activity, associated with PRR signaling [17]. This inhibition is mediated by direct protein\u2013protein interactions between Pol and the host DEAD box (D-E-A-D amino acid sequence motif) RNA helicase, DDX3, that enhances TBK1/IKK\u025b activity [17]. Peg-IFN-\u03b1 is an effective treatment for HBV infection, again suggesting that IFN treatment can overcome virus-imposed inhibition of the innate immune response, specifically IFN production. Peg-IFN-\u03b1 is an effective treatment option for hepatitis B e core antigen (HBeAg)-positive disease, where detection of HBeAg in the blood is indicative of viral replication. Up to 40% of HBeAg-positive patients treated with peg-IFN-\u03b1 are able to develop HBeAg-specific antibodies (seroconversion) by 6 months after the end of treatment. This percentage rises to 60% at 5 years after the end of treatment [58]. In comparison to monotherapy with the DAA lamivudine, which can lead to the emergence of mutant lamivudine-resistant HBV strains, peg-IFN-\u03b1 alone or in combination with lamivudine is up to 50% more effective for inducing HBeAg seroconversion, although more side effects are reported in patients receiving peg-IFN-\u03b1 [59]. In contrast to HBeAg-positive disease, peg-IFN-\u03b1, alone or in combination with ribavirin, has limited effect in patients with late stage HBeAg-negative disease, where the HBV mutation has resulted in loss of HBeAg expression [60]. In a randomized clinical trial, the percentage of HBeAg-negative patients with HBV DNA levels <10 000 copies/ml, receiving peg-IFN-\u03b1 monotherapy, dropped from 36% to 20%, from the end of treatment to 24 weeks later [60]. The stage of viral disease can therefore affect the efficacy of IFN therapy and the timing of treatment contributes to the capacity to resolve an infection. Moreover, as for influenza viruses and SARS-CoV, despite HBV and HCV encoding viral factors that antagonize an IFN response, exogenous IFN therapy has proven to be an effective treatment for establishing an SVR.",

The ability of IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 to target multiple types of viruses at different stages of viral replication, and the ubiquitous expression of IFN receptors on cells that are susceptible to different virus infections with different tissue tropisms, as well as the ability of IFNs to activate innate immune cells and influence the adaptive immune response, emphasizes the relevance of IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 as broad-spectrum antivirals.",

The opportunity to limit virus infections even in the absence of characterizing the specific infecting virus, a reality during an outbreak of unknown etiology, or during a pandemic of a newly emerging or re-emerging virus strain, has profound implications for global health. Indeed, early data indicate that IFN therapy may be effective in treating West Nile virus [68], hemorrhagic yellow fever virus [69] and Ebola virus infections [70]. Moreover, short-term IFN therapy for an acute virus infection may not invoke the debilitating side effects associated with long-term IFN therapy for chronic infections such as HBV and HCV. Preliminary data from pilot clinical trials of IFN treatment for SARS-CoV and for influenza A viruses showed this to be the case 46, 52. Cognizance of the yin and yang of viruses and IFNs opens the door to the widespread clinical application of these broad-spectrum antiviral IFNs.",

IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 bind with high affinity to the IFNAR complex, composed of an \u03b1-chain, IFNAR1, which is structurally modified by cell membrane glycosphingolipids, galabiosylceramide (Gb2) and globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) to promote efficient IFN binding 71, 72, and a \u03b2-chain, IFNAR2. IFN binding to IFNAR induces phosphorylation of the receptor-bound tyrosine kinases, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and JAK1, leading to the subsequent regulation of: (a) protein synthesis via the activation of PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); (b) histone modification, via the activation of p38 MAPK; and (c) gene expression via the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and MAPK activation. TYK2- and JAK1-mediated activation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and IRS2 is required for recruitment and activation of PI3K. PI3K phosphorylates AKT, which inactivates inhibitors of mTOR, tuberous sclerosis protein (TSC) 1 and TSC2 [73]. mTOR activates the serine/threonine kinase p70S6K, and inactivates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), to upregulate cap-dependent mRNA translation and protein synthesis. p38 is activated downstream of MAPK kinases 3 and 6 (MKK3/6) and regulates histone modification and gene expression through mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (Msk) 1 and Msk2. In addition, IFN signaling invokes promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein-mediated histone modification to regulate ISG expression [74]. Phosphorylation of STAT proteins results in their dimerization and IFN-stimulated gene factor (ISGF) formation. STAT complexes translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific gene elements in the promoters of ISGs, IFN-\u03b3 activated sequence (GAS) and IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE), to induce expression of antiviral genes.",

Furthermore, IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 upregulate the expression of IFN-inducible trans-membrane protein (IFITM), an inhibitor of influenza A viruses, SARS-CoV, dengue virus and West Nile virus infections 4, 76, tripartite motif-containing protein 5\u03b1 (TRIM5\u03b1) and TRIM22, which are antiviral factors that limit HIV-1 infection [77], and transcription factor jun-D (JUND) and claudin 4 (CLDN4) [78]. IFN treatment primes cells for apoptosis by modulating the expression of proteasome subunits, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, and FAS receptor (CD95) 79, 80, 81, 82. IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 also contribute to the activation and differentiation of cells involved in the (b) innate and (c) adaptive immune responses to virus infection. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induces production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and IL-15 by DCs, and IL-10 by macrophages to modulate B and T cell differentiation (Th1 polarization) and activation [79]. IFN-\u03b2 signaling in pDCs leads to altered CD69 and sphingosine-1-phosphate 4 (S1P4) receptor expression, thereby affecting pDC retention in lymph nodes [83]. IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 increase MHC class II, CD40 and CD86 expression on antigen presenting cells. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 treatment induces macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis 79, 84. Moreover, IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 promote neutrophil survival by activating cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) [5]. Natural killer (NK) cells respond to IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 with increased FAS ligand (FASL) and perforin expression, and IFN-\u03b3 production 85, 86.
