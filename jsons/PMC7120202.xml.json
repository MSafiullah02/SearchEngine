A substantial proportion of these cases (10 %) are defined as severe.

For those admitted to ICU, most Spanish and European studies have found that the most common pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed (although with variability in the percentages and depending on the series of cases) by Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Prevalence is generally lower for Haemophilus influenzae, whereas it is the flu virus that most commonly causes CAP.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the most common culprits are H. influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Moraxella catharralis. Aspergillus spp. is the least common.

This chain of events leads to a reduction in the elastic retraction forces that the respiratory muscles have to overcome, thereby reducing the respiratory workload. Pressure support ventilation (PSV) reduces inspiratory effort, and therefore also dyspnea, much more effectively. Also, because an inverse relation has been observed between the pressure applied with PSV and the respiratory rate, and another directly proportional relation between PSV and the circulating volume, it may also have a beneficial effect on oxygenation. This occurs because it decreases the respiratory workload and oxygen consumption, establishing a better ventilation/perfusion ratio as the result of producing larger tidal volumes. The combination of PSV and PEEP\u2014because it represents an inspiratory aid and counteracts the potential intrinsic PEEP (responsible for the extra effort the inspiratory muscles have to make to overcome the pressure gradient and achieve inspiratory flow)\u2014contributes to reducing the pressure and, consequently, the workload of the respiratory muscles. In clinical practice, it is accepted that the application of both PSV and PEEP can be the most appropriate ventilation method in this situation. So long as a balance is found between the optimal level of PEEP (to improve oxygenation) and the optimal level of PSV (to reduce the activity of the accessory muscles and respiratory rate and improve thoracoabdominal synchrony) the efficacy, at least initially, is similar to that of conventional mechanical ventilation.",

Also recently published is the REA-ICU scale, which identifies patients who are likely candidates for ICU admission during their first 3 days in hospital (Table 9.1) [1]. The incorporation of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin may improve the predictive capacity of these scales and allow better categorization of patients at high risk of dying [2]. Once in the ICU, the PIRO system, published only a few years ago, correctly identifies those whose lives are seriously at risk [3].\n",

            "text": "Noninvasive ventilation requires a respirator that applies positive pressure resulting in a transpulmonary pressure gradient, adequate tubing system and sensor systems, and above all an interface that adapts perfectly to the patient and enables adequate synchronization of the patient with the respirator. Although the main cause of mechanical failure of NIV is intolerance of the interface. Despite reports of the transparent helmet system improving comfort and reducing complications deriving from this technique, there are a number of factors inherent to the respirator that can critically affect adequate synchronisation. Among these factors are the following.\nInspiratory sensitivity. Flow-triggered inspiration is preferable to pressure-triggered inspiration. If the trigger is too sensitive, the machine auto-triggers (cycles triggered by the ventilator, not triggered by the effort of the patient). With NIV, the auto-trigger tends to occur because of leaks or a poorly fitting interface. The ventilator interprets the increase in flow which attempt to compensate the leak as ventilation demand from the patient, triggering unwanted assisted cycles.\nTime between the inspiratory effort and flow administration. The longer the interval, the greater is the respiratory workload. There have been reports of increased delay in the administration of flow in patients receiving PSV with the helmet system, causing a delay between the start of the inspiratory effort and obtaining pressure in the system. This situation has led to discomfort and poor coordination.\nInspiratory ramp or flow rate. In certain situations, a steep ramp allows delivery of flow in less time, reducing the sensation of \u201cair hunger\u201d and onset of the auto-PEEP, thereby making it more comfortable.\nExpiratory sensitivity. The patient sometimes terminates the inspiration before the respirator reaches the inspiratory flow-cycle threshold (in PSV, this often happens when 25 % of the peak flow rate is reached). This synchronization fault is called long-cycle asynchrony. In this case, an increase in the expiratory threshold sensor makes it possible to optimize the synchrony between patient and ventilator. In other instances, it may be due to the tidal volume being too high, which would have to be dealt by decreasing the PSV. Short-cycle asynchrony (when the patient\u2019s inspiratory time is longer than that of the respirator) tends to occur when chest wall/lung compliance is low or the patient is being underventilated. It can be resolved by reducing the expiratory threshold sensor or increasing the PSV.\nPEEP valves. The most suitable PEEP valves are threshold resistors. The external PEEP level necessary to reduce ineffective efforts due to auto-PEEP should never exceed 80 % of the auto-PEEP level. To lessen the problem of auto-PEEP, the bronchodilator treatment can be increased or the PSV reduced.\nHumidification system. The most appropriate humidification system is perhaps the surface humidifier (active humidification with an electric guide). Heat and moisture exchangers should be ruled out as they lead to increased dead space and cause an increased respiratory workload.\nLeak compensation system. Leaks can cause trigger failure and lengthen the inspiratory time in the PSV mode, leading to intolerance and failure of the NIV. This problem can be resolved by producing the cycle with a secondary safety feature that is usually time-controlled or changing to a pressure-limited, time-cycled ventilator mode.\n",

The evidence is weak regarding its use in patients with ARF secondary to asthma, ARDS, or pneumonia.Despite the fact that there is less evidence to support the application of NIV in patients with CAP, it can be considered in carefully selected patients but always under close monitoring in the ICU.The greatest benefits are perhaps obtained when applied early in patients with early-stage infection by well-trained, experienced teams, when the appropiate modes and interfaces are used, the correct empirical antibiotics are prescribed and, probably, when intravenous corticosteroids are administered.Adequately designed studies are required that do not include heterogeneous groups of patients with hypoxemic ARF. The patients should be exclusively those with pneumonia to determine the specific situations in which this ventilation method may be effective.\n",
