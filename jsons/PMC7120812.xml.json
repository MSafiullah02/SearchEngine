While the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) continue to claim millions of lives every year, viruses like the SARS coronavirus appear as human pathogens and novel variants of well-known viruses, like the H1N1/09 influenza virus, cause pandemics of global dimensions. Thus, there is a pressing unmet medical need to develop new antiviral drugs. While small molecules have dominated antivirals for decades, biologics like monoclonal antibodies and nucleic acids therapies have more recently been considered promising alternatives (1).",

RNAi is a posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism that is triggered by double-stranded RNA. For applications in mammalian cells, small interfering RNAs (siRNA) of approximately 19 base pairs with two nucleotide overhangs at the 3\u2032 ends of both strands become incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and induce cleavage of a complementary target RNA. Within just a few years, RNAi has become a standard molecular biological method to study gene functions. Moreover, the technology has been developed into a new therapeutic approach and approximately a dozen clinical trials based on RNAi are currently underway. Among these trials are various applications of RNAi to treat infections with the respiratory syncytial virus, HBV and HIV (5).",

Unfortunately, simply directing siRNAs to protein coding regions is insufficient, since silent mutations can cause the siRNAs to lose their inhibitory potential. Target regions with an important function in the structure of the RNA may prove to be a better choice to avoid viral escape. It has, for example, been shown that an siRNA against the highly conserved cis-acting replication element (CRE) was capable of inhibiting various enteroviruses over a long period, while an siRNA targeted against protein-encoding regions of the RNA, which are not organized into functional three dimensional structures, led to rapid viral escape (8). Since even the most careful selection of a single target site might be insufficient for sustained viral silencing, use of multiple siRNAs against multiple target sites may be necessary to prevent viral escape. In the case of coxsackievirus B3 and HIV-1, resistance rapidly emerged when single molecules were used, but a combination of three or four siRNAs, respectively, targeting distinct regions of the genome, were able to prevent the emergence of resistance (9, 10).",

Based on the experience in the antisense field, numerous modified nucleotides have been assessed for their applicability to enhance the stability of siRNAs against nucleases. Phosphorothioates, nucleotides with modifications at the 2\u2032 position (e.g., 2\u2032-O-methyl-RNA and 2\u2032-fluoro-nucleotides), as well as locked nucleic acids are among the most widely employed building blocks for RNAi applications. A fully modified siRNA with a drastically increased half-life in human serum had a significantly higher activity in a vector-based in vivo model of HBV infection as compared to the unmodified form (12). Furthermore, the introduction of modified nucleotides not only improves the stability of siRNAs, but can also reduce off-target effects (13) and improves the antiviral activity of siRNAs directed against highly structured target regions (14).",

            "text": "\nThe first major step for the design of highly active siRNAs consists of the selection of siRNA sequences with favorable thermodynamic features. The thermal stability of both ends, as well as base preferences of active siRNAs at certain positions, influence the silencing efficiency of an siRNA (15). For the design of siRNAs, publically available web tools are used (examples are given in Table 1). It is advisable to generate an siRNA pool with at least two different web tools. The BLAST option should be applied to avoid unspecific binding to endogenous target sequences, thereby reducing off-target effects. As an example, siRNA predesign using RNAi Designer from Invitrogen is described below:\nGo to the RNAi Designer website from Invitrogen (see Table 1).Choose siRNA as \u201cTarget Design Options.\u201dEnter the complete or partial target sequence. Use highly conserved regions of the virus (see Note 1).Deselect all options for target region selection (ORF, UTR).Select the BLAST database (e.g., if human viruses are to be targeted, choose human to avoid target sites within the human genome; for initial testing in animal models, homology to the animal\u2019s genome should be avoided as well).\u201cGC content\u201d should be set to a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 55%.Select default motif pattern (see Note 2).Submit by pressing the RNAi Design button. A summary of designed siRNAs is given in a new window. Sort the output by choosing ranking.Select siRNAs with 4\u00bd to 5 stars and copy the sequences.In general, choose the best siRNAs obtained with a design tool. If the siRNA design tool did not include a BLAST option, an NCBI BLAST should follow (see Note 3).\nThe obtained siRNA pool is subsequently filtered with respect to their thermodynamic features:\nConvert all sequences to obtain the antisense strand of each siRNA in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 orientation. Antisense strands are complementary to their target RNA (see Fig. 2).\nRemove duplicate siRNAs. Only 100% identical siRNA sequences should be excluded since a single nucleotide shift can sometimes influence the efficiency of an siRNA.Calculate the score of each siRNA based on the scoring system given in Table 2.\nExclude siRNAs that have less than 6 points of Reynolds\u2019 criteria.\nThe second major step is to exclude siRNAs whose antisense strand is predicted to form secondary structures. To this end, the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) of the siRNA antisense strand is determined. Negative \u0394G values indicate stable \u00adsecondary structures, whereas positive \u0394G values indicate instable secondary structures resulting in a high degree of unfolded single-stranded RNA. The \u0394G determination using the publically available UNAfold software is described. This software extended and replaced the mfold software of Zuker (16).\nGo to the Rensselaer bioinformatics web server (see Table 3) and use the DINAMelt Web Server.Select the application Nucleic Acid Quikfold.Enter all siRNA antisense strand sequences (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) which were obtained after first selection step (thermodynamic design of siRNAs, steps 1 and 2) separated by semicolons.Choose RNA (3.0) in the \u201cenergy rules\u201d field. The RNA is now folded at the fixed temperature of 37\u00b0C. The hybridization temperature can be modified by using RNA (2.3). Additionally, \u201csequence type\u201d has to be specified as linear. Other settings in this window are not necessary.\nSubmit to DINAMelt Server. A summary of potential folding results is given in a new window (see Note 4).Exclude all siRNAs whose antisense strand is predicted to form secondary structures indicated by at least one structure with a negative \u0394G value. Structures with \u0394G values around zero have a folding probability of 0.5 (17) and should be further analyzed (see Note 5).\nThe accessibility of the target RNA sequence will be considered in the third major step of siRNA design. The procedure consists of two steps: First, folding of the entire target RNA molecule and, second, the determination of the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) of the local RNA target site. \u0394G determination using the publically available mfold3.2 software, which should be used preferentially for long RNA sequences, is subsequently described (16).\nGo to the \u201cRensselaer bioinformatics web server\u201d (see Table 3) and use the Mfold Web Server.Select the application RNAfold.Enter the \u201cname\u201d and the \u201csequence\u201d to be folded.Choose \u201cRNA sequence is\u201d linear. The folding temperature is fixed at 37\u00b0C. This temperature can be modified by using the RNA mfold version 2.3 server. The \u201cupper bond on the number of computing folding\u201d can be limited to 10 or less for long sequences as they may increase the computational load and resulting response time. Other settings in this window are not necessary.Sequences shorter than 800 bases can be folded immediately (as of March 2010). For longer RNA sequences up to 6,000 bases, select batch and enter your E-mail address.Submit your entries by pressing the Fold RNA button.RNA sequences longer than 6,000 bases can be folded by the alternative \u201cBurnet Institute mfold Server\u201d (see Table 3). The application Submit a RNA sequence is based on mfold version 3.0. Parameters in this window can be set according to the mfold version 3.2 described above, except the folding temperature, which is not fixed at 37\u00b0C. Additionally, limit the \u201cupper bond on the number of computing folding\u201d to 10. Both \u201cRensselaer bioinformatics web server\u201d and \u201cBurnet Institute mfold Server\u201d will give a summary of potential folding results.\u0394G is calculated for a number of potential secondary structures (listed as \u201cStructure 1, 2, 3 \u2026\u201d beneath \u201cView Individual Structures\u201d). The more negative \u0394G, the more stable secondary structure is going to be, which also indicate a higher chance of its presence in a biological system.Save at least ten structures using the Download all foldings button.Find the corresponding target structures of the siRNAs in every potential folding.Select the most promising siRNA target sites by checking the following points:\n(i)Number of identical or similar target sites. The program will give various structures and corresponding energies (\u0394G). Good target accessibility in different structure predictions increases the possibility of overall target accessibility.(ii)Number of bonds. High number of bonds (base pairs) within the target sequence indicates a strong secondary structure and less accessibility for an siRNA.\nDetermine the \u0394G value of the local RNA target structure for the selected siRNA target sites:\n(i)Find the corresponding siRNA target site and determine all bases within the target site that are involved in forming a secondary structure. Add also bases or base pairs which are part of the close neighborhood, for example bases that form loops, even if these are not part of the siRNA target site.(ii)Go to Thermodynamic Details of chosen structure in the Output window (folding results).(iii)Find the corresponding bases (marked by numbers) and add all single \u0394G values of involved bases. Energies of helices and loops have to be included if one base of this structure is part of the target site. This calculation results in an approximation of \u0394G\nlocal which is usually sufficient. If precise calculation of \u0394G\nlocal is necessary, please refer to the Turner energy rules (Table 3).(iv)Calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) of all local RNA target structures (\u0394G\nlocal).\n\n\n",

            "text": "The protocol for TOPO cloning described in the following section is a shortened version of the instruction manual (see Note 8). The TOPO cloning allows the ligation of the PCR-amplified target sequence of the virus into either pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO or pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO. The terms CT and NT indicate that GFP will be expressed fused to, respectively, the C-terminus and N-terminus of the target sequence.\nIsolate the virus DNA or RNA using a commercial DNA or RNA virus isolation kit.Perform a reverse transcription reaction if the isolated virus contains an RNA genome.Design the primer for TOPO cloning. Do not add 5\u2032 phosphates to the PCR primers. The pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO does not contain an ATG initiation codon. The PCR product must, therefore, be cloned in frame with GFP. If the target sequence to be amplified lacks the ATG initiation codon, then the Kozak consensus sequence (Kozak consensus sequence is: (G or A)NNATGG (N  =  any base)) needs to be incorporated into the forward primer. The PCR product for pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO may also be cloned in frame with GFP, but this is not essential if a translational stop codon is introduced upstream of the virus target sequence. We observed an improved GFP expression using this modified reporter plasmid, in which the viral target sequence is part of the untranslated region of the GFP reporter. The stop codon can be incorporated into the forward primer, for example: 5\u2032-TGA NNN N\u2026Run the PCR to amplify your target cDNA sequence.Gel-purify the DNA fragment of interest (partial virus cDNA target sequence).Add Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 0.4 mM dATP, and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase to the gel-purified DNA fragment (see Note 9).Incubate 10 min at 72\u00b0C.Place the vials on ice.Add 1 \u03bcl of salt solution and 1 \u03bcl of TOPO vector to 4 \u03bcl of the PCR product to set up the TOPO Cloning reaction (see Note 10).Mix gently and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Place the tube on ice and store the sample at \u221220\u00b0C until later use, or proceed directly with transformation.Thaw a tube containing 100 \u03bcl chemically competent Escherichia coli cells. Alternatively, use 50 \u03bcl TOP10 cells provided with the GFP Fusion TOPO TA Expression Kit (see Note 11).Add 2 \u03bcl of the TOPO Cloning reaction (ligation reaction) to the tube containing 100 \u03bcl of chemically competent E. coli cells and mix gently. Do not mix by pipetting up and down.Place the tube on ice and incubate for 30 min.Heat-shock the E. coli cells for 60 s at 42\u00b0C without shaking.Transfer the tube to ice and incubate for 3 min.Add 700 \u03bcl of room temperature LB medium without antibiotics.Cap the tube tightly and shake the tube horizontally at 37\u00b0C for 45 min.Sediment the transformed E. coli cells by centrifugation at 3,000  \u00d7  g for 5 min and discard 700 \u03bcl of the supernatant.Resuspend the E. coli cells in residual LB medium.Spread all of the transformation on a prewarmed selective plate (containing the antibiotic ampicillin) and incubate overnight at 37\u00b0C.Pick ten colonies.Culture all colonies overnight in 3 ml LB medium containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin.Isolate plasmid DNA. In general, low amount and purity are sufficient for restriction analysis and/or sequencing.To verify the orientation of the insert, analyze the plasmids by restriction analysis. To this end, it is advantageous to use at least one restriction site located within the virus target sequence and one that is present in the vector (see Note 12).Clones containing inserts in the correct orientation should be sequenced to confirm that the original sequence has not been mutated (see Subheading 2.1, items 8 and 9).Culture the clone of choice in 200 ml LB medium containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin.Isolate the plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA for transfection into eukaryotic cells must be very clean and free from phenol and sodium chloride to prevent cell death and to avoid low transfection efficiencies.\n",

One approach to reduce off-target effects is to prevent the incorporation of the unwanted sense strand in RISC. This can, for example, be achieved by an LNA modification at the 5\u2032 end (21), or by introduction of a 2\u2032-O-methyl modification at position 1 and 2 (13) of the sense strand. However, a specific reduction of off-target effects was observed when position 2 of the antisense strand was additional 2\u2032-O-methyl modified (13). In theory, chemical modifications of an siRNA will also result in increased serum stability. In practice, siRNA modifications are often accompanied by decreased silencing efficiency compared to the unmodified siRNA. LNA modifications introduced at any position except 1, 10, 12, and 14 in the antisense strand do not cause substantial loss of silencing efficiency (21). Another way to combine high silencing efficiency, increased serum stability, and reduced off-target effects is complete modification with different nucleotide analogs as shown for an siRNA targeting the HBV genome (12) (Fig. 5). However, chemical modifications are dependent on the application as well as on the virus to be inhibited.\n",

            "text": "\nIn order to identify conserved regions in the viral genome, it is advisable to select sequences of various strains and perform a BLAST search. Regions with high homology can be considered conserved and represent suitable siRNA target sites.Tuschl\u2019s motif pattern strongly restricts the number of siRNAs for subsequent selection, which may become a problem if short sequences are targeted.The NCBI BLAST tool or/and the Ensembl BLAST tool can be used for homology searches (see Table 3).If the summary of potential folding is: \u201cNo folding possible\u201d and/or the software are/is showing the term \u221e for \u0394G, then the RNA sequence does not form any secondary structure.If all siRNAs (antisense strand) give negative \u0394G values, examine all structures again and use only siRNAs that show stem-loop structures with \u22652 nucleotide free at the 5\u2032 terminus and \u22654 free nucleotides at the 3\u2032 terminus for further analyses (17).If no siRNAs meet the indicated criteria, first check if another partial sequence of the virus can be targeted. Alternatively, the threshold for \u0394G of the local RNA target site can be adjusted, especially if many siRNAs remain whose antisense strands do not form stable secondary structures (see also Note 5). To this end, select at least four siRNAs in order of their \u0394G\nlocal values. The threshold of Reynolds\u2019 criteria should not be changed.In general, it is best to include a partial target RNA with a length of 1\u20132 kb that spans the siRNA target sequence.Both an extended protocol and a trouble shouting guide of TOPO cloning can be found in the complete instruction manual provided with the kit.For long virus target sequences, use a polymerase with proofreading activity. Since the amplified sequences will lack 3\u2032 A-overhangs, which are essential for the described cloning method, additional incubation with Taq polymerase is necessary.If E. coli is to be transformed by electroporation, the salt solution must be diluted fourfold to a final concentration of 50 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM MgCl2 to prevent arcing.Optionally, 1.5 \u03bcl of 1.42 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol can be added to the chemically competent E. coli cells followed by an incubation on ice for 20 min. This procedure may increase the transformation efficiency. Store the 1.42 mM solution of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol at 4\u00b0C.Vector maps and sequences of pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO and pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO are available on the Invitrogen website (see Table 3). Vector map and sequence of psiCHECK-2 is available on the Promega website (see Table 3).Other restriction sites may also be suitable. In this case, customize the additional bases for efficient restriction and the incubation time. An extensive table is provided by New England Biolabs (see Table 3).The use of other cell lines or/and other transfection reagents will require different conditions than those given here.Density of SDS-polyacrylamide gel depends on molecular weight (MW) of the target sequence. If pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO was used, add the MW of GFP (around 15 kD) to the calculated MW of the target sequence for an estimate, though some sequences may influence gel mobility, leading to measured weights other than the predicted value.LARII aliquots have to be thawed at room temperature, as the reagent is heat-labile.Incubation overnight is also possible if the cells are plated at a lower density.An m.o.i. of 0.1 is suitable for many viruses, but in some cases may need to be adjusted. The control infection should show as many individual plaques as can be reliably counted. An effective siRNA will appreciably reduce the number of plaques, while a weak siRNA may only lead to a slight reduction. A large number of distinguishable plaques on the control plate will simplify the recognition of weak siRNAs, which may be desirable if further optimization is possible.FCS within a medium may interfere with viral infection efficiency.Incubation time depends on the infection cycle of a specific virus.Neutral red as well as crystal violet is taken up by healthy cells, but not by dead cells. Plaques therefore appear as clear circles against the red/violet background. If the clear areas overlap too much, it is difficult to recognize individual plaques and infection time should be reduced. If plaques are too small to be easily read, try extending infection time, though it could also be an indication of a defective or weakened strain.The staining can be accelerated by using crystal violet solution. To this end, fix the cells with 10% TCA for 10 min at room temperature. Then remove the agar without disturbing the cell monolayer and add 500 \u03bcl of crystal violet solution (0.5% solution in PBS) to each of the wells and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (see Note 21). Remove the stain by aspiration and wash with PBS. Invert the plate, and count the plaques of each well. Calculate the viral titer as described in Subheading 3.5.2, step 22.\n",
