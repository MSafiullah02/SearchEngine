Indeed, the possibility of foodborne transmission cannot be ruled out for any virus. However, these possibilities should be understood in-depth as supported by scientific data and analysis so that the virus spread could be controlled in a more focused and efficient way. In this review, we intend to make a comparison between coronaviruses (CoVs) with the most recognized foodborne virus, human NoVs, in order to supply evidence to evaluate the possibilities of foodborne transmission of CoVs. The comparisons were performed from four different perspectives including the epidemiological evidence, their presence in foods, their persistence in food systems, and their relevant clinical manifestations.",

The link between many of the illnesses and the human NoVs- contaminated-food consumption has been clearly demonstrated (Table 1\n) thanks to the comprehensive investigations among all the components of a food control system. Typically, a successful foodborne outbreak investigation will need collaborative efforts from food law and regulations, food control management, inspection services, epidemiological and food monitoring (laboratory services) and consumers\u2019 education of and communication. Verhoef et al. [3] estimated the proportion of foodborne infections caused by human NoVs on a global scale to be as high as \u223c14%. Meanwhile, it should be well noted that large-scale outbreaks are often the result of a combination of several transmission routes. For example, the virus can first infect a sensitive population by food, water or an asymptomatic shedder, and a more efficient viral spread in a large group of population could be followed by direct person-to-person contact or via a contaminated environment.",

However, care should be taken when interpreting the results of virus detection from foods with the use of molecular methods. In-depth understanding over the virus quantities in relation to a dose-dependent effect and the virus viability (as the molecular methods detecting the presence of nucleic acids are not able to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viruses) are of crucial importance in order to determine the relevant public health influence.",

Since molecular methods underestimate largely the infectivity decrease of viruses, we only included data generated with the use of cell culture based methods or from human volunteer studies. Although there have been recent breakthroughs reported in human NoV tissue culture models [4\u2022], it is not yet commonly used for routine food and environmental testing due to the presence of residual food matrix components as well as the cost and labour implications. Surrogates including feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and coliphage MS2 that share pathological and/or biological features with human NoVs have been widely used to study the stability of human NoVs. For CoVs, although the most-of-interest strains are SARS-CoVs and other severe syndrome strains such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), working with BSL-3 laboratory containment places can cause significant practical challenges, and thus researchers have employed surrogates such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a diarrheal pathogen of swine, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a respiratory and enteric pathogen of laboratory mice, to study the survival and persistence of CoVs. Consequently, large variabilities were observed even within the NoVs or CoVs used in different studies (Table 3).",

However, the influence of relative humidity (RH) is contradictory for different viruses. HAV survived better at higher RH [5], while MS2 and MERS-CoV survived better at lower RH [5, 6]. Similarly, no consensus could be reached for the influence of organic (food) matters. On one hand, MNV showed 6.2-log reduction on residue-free coupons and only 1.4-log reduction on coupons with lettuce, cabbage, or ground pork residues [7]. On the other hand, MNV showed infectivity reduction rate of 0.16-log PFU/day in surface water and 0.04-log PFU/day in groundwater at 25 \u00b0C [8]. Similarly, human coronavirus (HCoV) survived for 10-100 days in tap water, yet for only 2 to 4 days in wastewater [9]. At 25 \u00b0C, TGEV survived for 22 days, and MHV survived for 17 days in reagent-grade water, whereas in wastewater, TGEV survived for 9 days and MHV survived for 7 days [10].

Besides, the clinical manifestations of human NoVs also have the following features being believed to contribute to its \u201cachievement as a successful foodborne virus\u201d. First, human NoVs are extremely contagious. The infectious dose of human NoVs was estimated to be as low as 10 particles [15]. Second, once infected, human NoV particles can be shed from the stool and vomit of the patients in large quantities (e.g. up to >1010 genomic copies per gram of feces [16]). Moreover, it has been discovered that asymptomatic infections with long-term fecal shedding (up to three weeks) of human NoVs can have a high prevalence, especially in the group of children [17].",

For instance, in a recent investigation, 41 (55%) out of 74 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their fecal samples and the fecal shedding remained for a mean of 27.9 days after the first symptom onset [18]. However, there is so far no clear evidence showing SARS-CoV-2 can cause infection in human digestive tracts. Considering the high probability of infection of SARS-CoV-2 (basic reproduction number estimated to be above 2.0 by WHO [19]), assumptions could be made that the viruses may migrate from the oral ingestion to the respiratory tracts via, for instance, the throat. However, this assumption will need sound experimental and/or clinical supports not only in a qualitative way (to show whether it is possible for the virus to migrate from oral ingestion to the respiratory tract), but also in a quantitative way. Since if large quantities of viruses must be ingested in order to cause the migration, the chance of such occurrence could be very low in reality.",

Although CoVs indeed showed the possibilities to remain infectious on foods and/or food packaging materials long enough (from several days to several weeks) to potentially cause transmission, they were found to be less resistant to chemical and physical disinfections than NoVs. More importantly, CoVs mainly spread through the respiratory tract and there is no clear evidence showing CoVs can follow fecal-oral routes and cause infection in the human digestive tracts.",
