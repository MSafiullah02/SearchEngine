            "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are segments of DNA with the ability to relocate within or between genomes, which is conferred by the element-encoded enzymatic functions. Traditionally, TEs are divided into two major classes: class I (retrotransposons) code for a reverse transcriptase (RT) capable of making a cDNA copy of the template RNA, which serves as a transposition intermediate; and class II (DNA TEs) code for a transposase, which can mobilize DNA in the absence of RNA intermediates (Finnegan 1989; Wicker et al. 2007; Kapitonov and Jurka 2008). Retrotransposons are in turn subdivided into four subclasses: LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which are closely related to retroviruses; nonLTR retrotransposons, also called LINEs; DIRS, or YR-retrotransposons; and Penelope-like elements (PLEs). These subclasses are phylogenetically distinct, and their RTs usually operate together with the respective types of coencoded phosphotransferase/endonuclease (EN) DNA-cleaving enzymes: IN (DDE-integrase); APE (apurinic-apyrimidinic EN) or REL (restriction enzyme-like EN); YR (tyrosine recombinase); and GIY-YIG (nickase initially identified in prokaryotic group I introns). It is the concerted action of the RT and the phosphotransferase that determines the retroelement\u2019s ability to insert into internal genomic locations. Enzymatically active domains are typically fused into a single polyprotein called pol, which may undergo proteolytic processing or function as a multi-domain protein. Formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle is ensured by the structural ORF1 (gag), which is usually separated from the downstream ORF2 (pol) by a programmed ribosomal frameshift or by in-frame stop codons. Downstream of pol, many retrovirus-like TEs have incorporated env genes of various origins coding for envelope glycoproteins responsible for membrane fusion and interaction with cell surface receptors during viral entry and egress. Two families of RT-containing viruses, hepadnaviruses and caulimoviruses (collectively called pararetroviruses), differ from retroviruses in encapsidating their DNA instead of RNA, and do not regularly integrate into chromosomes (Glebe and Bremer 2013; Hohn and Rothnie 2013).",

Canonical PLEs are 3\u20134 kilobases (kb) in length; are framed by terminal repeats called pLTRs, which may be either direct or inverted; encode an RT with a C-terminal GIY-YIG EN domain; and yield target-site duplications (TSD) of variable length upon insertion (Evgen'ev and Arkhipova 2005). Of special interest is the unique group of PLE RTs named Athena (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007). Previously described Athena retroelements are 4\u20136 kb in length; are phylogenetically distinct from canonical Penelope RTs; do not carry EN domains; and contain stretches of telomeric repeats at the junctions with host DNA. Such EN-deficient RTs are found at or near telomeres in many basidiomycete fungi and in a few plants and protists, but are particularly abundant at telomeres of bdelloid rotifers (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007).",

Genome sequencing of the first bdelloid representative, Adineta vaga, revealed that over 8% of its genes originate from bacteria, fungi, plants, or protists (Flot et al. 2013). Known TE families make up over 3% of the A. vaga genome, and are characterized by low copy numbers and high family diversity. Recently, we described canonical Penelope retrotransposons from A. vaga, which integrate into internal chromosomal locations with the aid of the C-terminal GIY-YIG EN domain (Arkhipova et al. 2013). Here we investigate Athena-containing retroelements in A. vaga, compare their organization in related species separated by tens of millions of years, and discover that they possess an extraordinarily complex structure not yet described in retroelements. We also uncover the basis for their affinity to telomeres and identify putative cis-acting elements that may play a role in mobilizing genes of foreign origin and members of multigene families.",

The commonly used TE detection pipelines perform poorly on A. vaga due to over-abundance of low-copy-number families with one or two members (Flot et al. 2013). Most of the computer-generated Athena consensi were represented by RT and some adjacent sequences, but their boundary verification was far from straightforward. Specifically, while the 3\u2032 boundary, at least in some families, was relatively easy to define from comparison between inserts, the 5\u2032 boundaries were mostly formed by variably positioned 5\u2032-truncations of apparently longer units, which included a variety of ORFs shared by some families but different in others. All other bdelloid TEs (LTR, nonLTR, DNA TEs) form well-defined host-TE boundaries (Flot et al. 2013).",

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small RNAs typically expressed from specialized loci termed piRNA clusters, which in many genomes are composed of multiple adjacent TEs or their fragments, and ensure silencing of homologous TEs in the germ line (Weick and Miska 2014). Our piRNA libraries, as expected, were highly enriched in known A. vaga TEs (Rodriguez and Arkhipova 2016). Notably, for most Athena RTs, we observed that piRNA coverage extends well beyond the RT ORF (fig. 1). However, inspection of RT flanks did not reveal any sequences that might correspond to adjacent TEs in a piRNA cluster. Instead, the zone of piRNA coverage includes a multitude of densely spaced ORFs, which display the same polarity as Athena RTs, and apparently constitute parts of very large transposable units.\n",

A genome-wide inventory of host-TE boundaries near Athena-like RTs in A. vaga reveals that, although the immediate RT environment does not always include such repeats, they are invariably found at the actual TE-host junction (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). In other words, the RT is not always positioned near the 3\u2032-end of the entire unit, so that a series of intervening ORFs may appear between the RT and telomeric repeats at the host-TE boundary. The 5\u2032-boundaries in most cases are also formed by stretches of telomeric repeats capping 5\u2032-terminally truncated copies.

Indeed, we were unable to find a TE or a host gene interrupted by a Terminon insertion. On the contrary, we observed multiple cases in which part of a preexisting TE or gene was irreversibly lost by truncation, with subsequent addition of telomeric repeats and Terminon attachment (supplementary table S1 and figs. S1A and S6, Supplementary Material online). Remarkably, the added Terminon units can extend telomeres by tens of kb at a time. Such additions can effectively counteract the ongoing terminal erosion, the dynamic nature of which is seen from comparison of the same A. vaga telomere at different points in time: telomere M1 (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) from a 2006 fosmid library, compared to the corresponding region in the genome of the same clonal culture in 2010 (Flot et al. 2013), underwent loss of the distal 11-kb chain of Ath-M and Ath-O elements and unique host genes (as validated by PCR), and ends with a stretch of telomeric repeats added de novo to the proximal Ath-Y (supplementary fig.

Each additional ORF (Rep, DEDDy, GIY-YIG, CC, and TM) can be intronless or may contain introns in conserved positions (0\u20137 introns per ORF, as in GIY-YIG or Rep ORFs) (supplementary figs.

These exonucleases perform 3\u2032-end processing of structured RNAs (RNase D, RNase T, exosome subunit Rrp6), but may also act on single-stranded DNAs (WRN, DnaQ, and proofreading subunits of A- and B-type DNA polymerases). Six of the Terminon-encoded exonucleases are of the DEDYD-type, with the second D replaced with E (DEEYD); the remaining three derivatives in L1\u2013L3 families lack the acidic residues, indicating catalytic inactivity. An additional EHCHC motif in all families, which is known to coordinate Zn2+ binding in Maelstrom proteins involved in piRNA biogenesis (Chen et al. 2015), suggests conservation of the RNA binding function.

Most members of the L1\u2013L3 families encode these ORFs (table 1), which are similar to PC-esterases (pfam13839), enzymes predicted to have acyl esterase activity modifying cell-surface biopolymers such as glycans and glycoproteins (Anantharaman and Aravind 2010). However, the hydrolytic function of these ORFs must be impaired, as the Ser residues of the catalytic S-N-H triad are lacking. GDSL-esterase-like ORFs in a subset of nonLTR retrotransposons (CR1, RTEX, and BRIDGE1), which differ from PC-esterases, are thought to interact with membrane glycoproteins to facilitate entry or exit (Kapitonov and Jurka 2003; Schneider et al. 2013), and at least some of them possess hydrolytic activity, while others lack such activity but preserve binding properties (Montanier et al. 2009). In the viral world, analogous ORFs encode hemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoproteins in ssRNA viruses, for example, orthomyxoviruses (influenza C) and coronaviruses (Zeng et al. 2008). Notably, the GDSL domain is found in the I family as an integral part of ORF1, although it may also lack catalytic activity (supplementary figs. S5 and S6D, Supplementary Material online).",

            "text": "In geminivirus Rep proteins, the N-terminal catalytic domain is critical for origin recognition and DNA cleavage/nucleotidyl transfer, while the C-terminal domain possesses helicase activity and belongs to superfamily 3 helicases (S3H or SF3), also classified as AAA+ ATPases (Campos-Olivas et al. 2002; Hickman and Dyda 2005; Clerot and Bernardi 2006). Out of 18 Terminon families, eight are associated with geminivirus-like Rep ORFs (table 1). Only three of them, however, are carrying the intact catalytic domain with two histidines (HxH or HUH) required for metal binding, the tyrosine performing DNA cleavage and ligation (YxxK motif), and the S3H domain (Chandler et al. 2013). Several families carry a shorter ORF derived from the N-terminal catalytic domain (Rep-Nc), which lost the metal-binding HUH and the catalytic YxxK motifs, but has persisted throughout evolution as a distinct clade (supplementary fig. S3C, Supplementary Material online). While some of the families retain only the helicase moieties (Rep-C), these are not phylogenetically distinct and likely correspond to random 5\u2032-deletion products (supplementary fig. S3C, Supplementary Material online). Rep ORFs are more similar to geminiviruses than to A. vaga Helitrons, which also contain Rep domains (Kapitonov and Jurka 2007), and display the characteristic geminiviral domain structure that includes not only HUH-Y2 and S3H, but also the central domain Gemini_AL1_M (pfam08283). In contrast to other Terminon ORFs, such as GIY-YIG or CC-ORF (supplementary figs. S3 and S7, Supplementary Material online), there is no concordance between Rep-based and RT-based phylogenies between families (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). Together with lack of unidirectionality, phylogenetic incongruence indicates that Reps are not integral components of Terminons, but instead can establish an association with them, possibly aided by intersecting steps of their replication mechanisms, for example, a putative single-stranded DNA intermediate, and once associated, tend to propagate as a unit.",

Most of the numerous CC-ORFs, which are 400\u2013500 aa in length and occur as stand-alone coding sequences on either side of Athena RTs, exhibit similarity to the N-terminal moieties of RTs (equivalent to ORF1 in the frameshifted W and VX clades). The extreme N-terminus of RTs is clade-specific and comes in three variants (supplementary fig. S7A and B, Supplementary Material online). In the ILOM clade, it contains an excess of polar (S, T, Q, N, and Y) with some basic (K and R) residues. In the catalytically dead JVX clade, it displays a high content of acidic residues (D and E) at the N-termini, and weak matches to BAR domains sensing membrane curvature (pfam03114). In the intron-rich, catalytically intact NT and W clades, it carries a conserved N-terminal KR-rich motif with an adjacent region of weak homology to helix-turn-helix dsDNA-binding motifs, while the central core occasionally shows similarity to DnaJ chaperones and surface antigens (pfam00226). The stand-alone CC-ORFs share a common ancestor either with NWT-like (with the KR-rich motif) or with JVX-like (DE-rich with a conserved SGTG motif) N-terminal RT moieties, however they have evolved and diversified as separate clades (supplementary fig. S7, Supplementary Material online). One of the conserved intron positions coincides in both types of CC-ORFs in the core region common to all clades (supplementary fig. S7B, Supplementary Material online). While ORF1\u2019s and CC-ORFs do not resemble classical orthoretroviral gag genes and lack Zn-knuckles, they are reminiscent of the gag genes forming nucleocapsids in foamy viruses (Spumaretrovirinae), which are similarly sized, do not undergo proteolytic processing, and contain up to four coiled-coil motifs (Goldstone et al. 2013; Mullers 2013). A combination of KR-rich and DE-rich N-termini in co-occurring CC-ORFs is highly likely to affect RNP properties, and might aid in raising the limits on RNA packaging.",

However, upon inspection of the larger Terminon units, it became evident that, in contrast to canonical Penelopes, pLTRs are not always found around the RT ORF. Even if present, they do not necessarily delimit the boundaries of the transposed unit, as the region of within-family homology may extend beyond pLTRs. Most Terminon pLTRs end in reverse-complement telomeric repeats (ACACCC)n forming the 3\u2032-boundary of the unit (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Furthermore, no TSDs surrounding pLTRs, as in canonical Penelope elements, can be discerned. In addition, pLTR-like sequences can frame nonRT ORFs (e.g., DEDDy-like ORFs in the L family; supplementary fig. S6D, Supplementary Material online), and thus are not directly associated with RTs per se. Collectively, these observations confirm that the presence of pLTRs in Terminons is not a result of their regeneration during each retrotransposition cycle, as in retroviral LTRs. Instead, it may be that pLTR conservation results from the presence of hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) motifs described below, which were identified in pLTRs.",

A total of 497 HHR motifs fitting these descriptors were detected in A. vaga scaffolds, and assigned to M, O, W1, N, Q, R, S, and T families. Inspection of the remaining families revealed the essential core motifs (cuganga\u2026gaaa) in the L and W families, albeit with a slightly different spacing (a much longer loop 2) (fig. 3A). When we modified the descriptor to accommodate these families, HHR-like motifs were detected in all PLE families, except for K, W2, and P. However, all members of the K, W2, and P families contain substitutions in the core HHR motif, although the sequence can easily be aligned with other HHRs and apparently preserves the structural helices (fig. 3A). The P family in the congeneric Adineta sp. 11 (fig. 3A:supplementary fig. S6B, Supplementary Material online) carries a mutation in a different part of the catalytic core. The substitution in the core catalytic HHR motif, however, did not prevent successful expansion of W2 family in A. vaga (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online), implying that RNA structural properties are more important for proliferation than catalytic properties. Indeed, our tests for HHR activity in vitro (fig. 3B) demonstrate that self-cleavage in the JW HHR (three identical tandem units) is seen only in 25 mM MnCl2 and does not occur under physiological conditions or in MgCl2, reinforcing the idea that efficient catalysis in the HHR motif is not required for Terminon transposition. Although HHR motifs in a few other PLEs are also nonfunctional under physiological conditions (Cervera and De la Pena 2014), our experiments show that the HHR in a canonical A. vaga PLE, AvPen3a (Arkhipova et al. 2013), can efficiently self-cleave as a monomer in 3 mM MgCl2 (fig. 3C). Tandem duplication of the HHR-bearing segments is thought to be important for functionality of minimalist HHRs in a dimeric configuration (Cervera and De la Pena 2014), although, contrary to the dimer requirement reported for PLEs (L\u00fcnse et al. 2016), the AvPen3a HHR functions as a monomer.\n",

It should be noted that Terminons are ideally suited for establishment of piRNA clusters (Weick and Miska 2014). These genomic loci, which give rise to noncanonical Pol II transcripts processed into piRNAs, are characterized, inter alia, by extended transcript length and intron retention (Sapetschnig and Miska 2014; Chen et al. 2016). Furthermore, not only can Terminons generate long sense-strand transcripts, but many copies are flanked at the 3\u2032-end by an adjacent host gene in antisense orientation (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) with the potential to provide a promoter for antisense transcription, which could stimulate formation of a dual-strand piRNA cluster (Sapetschnig and Miska 2014). If a flanking gene is 3\u2032-truncated by terminal erosion and loses transcription termination signals, the resulting transcriptional readthrough would yield antisense Terminon transcripts, and hence RNA-mediated silencing (Kowalik et al. 2015).\n",

These fragments can now be reliably assigned to W, K, and N Terminon clades. To evaluate the degree of Terminon conservation in bdelloids, we inspected sequenced cosmid inserts from P. roseola, as well as Athena-containing contigs from a draft PacBio assembly of a natural isolate Adineta sp.11. In P. roseola, Terminons are joined to host DNA via a different telomeric repeat hexamer (tcaccc)n while in Adineta sp. 11 junctions are mostly formed by a variant octamer (tcacaccc)n. Strikingly, ORF composition and even syntenic blocks have been preserved in several families, and thus can be traced back to their common ancestor. For example, the extended ORF block in the S/T family, which includes the catalytically dead AthX and AthV (GIY-YIG, DEDDy, AthX, AthV, 2xGIY-YIG, CCJVX, AthT, aORF; supplementary fig. S6C, Supplementary Material online), appears in both Adineta spp., which diverged over 10 Mya, and phylogenetic analysis of Terminon ORFs confirms the presence of virtually every described family throughout each species\u2019 evolutionary history (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). Although nonRT Terminon-associated ORFs are shorter and less conserved than RTs, yielding less reliable branch support, their phylogeny is broadly congruent with the RT-based phylogeny, indicating that these ORFs have largely coevolved within each Terminon family (supplementary figs. S3B and S7, Supplementary Material online). The apparent exception is the Rep-related ORFs, for which a discordant phylogeny hints at the more transient character of their association with Terminons, albeit sufficiently prolonged to allow intron accumulation (fig. 3C). Overall, while the prevailing mode of inheritance for each Terminon family appears to be vertical, they may also persist within genera and species via horizontal mobility if a master copy is lost.",

At such distances, the overall TE density in A. vaga was shown to be significantly higher around foreign genes, and vice versa (Flot et al. 2013). We began by counting the number of telomeric repeats in windows of 2, 5, and 10 kb around each TE type. Using single-factor ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s test), we investigated distribution of telomeric repeats around different TE families for each window size. It is evident that the number of telomeric repeats is significantly higher near Athena RTs than near LTR, nonLTR, TIR, and Helitron elements, for window sizes \u2265 2kb (fig. 4B andsupplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online).

It is therefore of special interest to identify taxonomic groups harboring hitherto unknown TE types. The principal subdivision between TEs rests upon the involvement of RNA into the replication cycle (class I TEs) or lack thereof (class II TEs). In class I autonomous TEs, the process of RNA copying into DNA requires that the TE codes for an RT, the enzyme capable of performing RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. On these grounds, the novel TEs described herein, named Terminons, can be unambiguously classified as retrotransposons. This, however, does not rule out the presence of enzymatic activities that may be involved in additional stages of the transposition cycle, which may even include rolling-circle replication. In total, the newly annotated Terminons occupy 1.1% of the A. vaga genome, increasing the known TE content from \u223c3% (Flot et al. 2013) to slightly over 4%.",

S2, Supplementary Material online), which in nonLTR retrotransposons is often ascribed to premature RT fall-offs, in Terminons may also result from terminal DNA erosion, if the 5\u2032-end is exposed to exonucleases before being capped by telomeric repeats. Long head-to-tail chains of sequentially added Terminons can exceed 60 kb in length, thereby greatly increasing the buffer zone that counteracts the ongoing terminal erosion. Site-specific integration into telomeric repeats, as observed in Bombyx mori for SART/TRAS retrotransposons (Fujiwara et al. 2005), is highly unlikely, because Terminons are often found attached to terminally truncated and healed host genes or TEs. The observed bias towards oppositely oriented transcriptional units, especially 3\u2032-truncated ones, could indicate a shift from uni-strand piRNA-producing loci known to operate in somatic tissues to dual-strand loci known to operate in the germ line, via antisense transcriptional units often lacking a proper poly(A) signal (Mohn et al. 2014; Weick and Miska 2014; Kowalik et al. 2015). Members of the most prolific T family (supplementary figs.

Neither could we find any extra ORFs in EN-deficient RTs of telomeric Coprina PLEs in numerous sequenced filamentous fungi, where they occur in tandem arrays (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007; Arkhipova et al. 2013). Fungal EN(\u2212) PLEs can be very efficient at terminal addition, occupying every telomere in some basidiomycetes, for example, Agaricus bisporus and Tuber melanosporum (Martin et al. 2010; Foulongne-Oriol et al. 2013). These EN(\u2212) PLEs code for a single nonframeshifted ca. 1000-aa CC-RT ORF, but have no additional coding capacities. Thus, terminal addition per se does not require an extended ORF repertoire, although telomeric placement is clearly associated with the HHR motifs and reverse-complement telomeric repeats, which in bdelloids are uniquely exposed next to the HHR fold for optimal annealing to G-rich overhangs (fig. 3A and D).",

Rather, their phylogeny is more consistent with complex elements evolving from shorter ones via splitting of longer ORFs; acquisition of additional ORFs, possibly at the transcript level to account for coorientation; accumulation of introns; and loss of frameshifts. The L clade may serve as an example of recent expandability, as it still retains HHR remnants between neighboring ORFs (supplementary fig. S6D, Supplementary Material online). A split of ancestral elements into individual subdomains, perhaps by insertion of W-like ORFs, may have been accompanied by combination of elements with different subdomains, eventually giving rise to a highly complex structure preserving only one active RT compatible with a cognate HHR motif, which permits retrotransposition of the entire unit starting with HHR. The pLTR structure appears to have undergone a shift in HHR positioning relative to telomeric repeats (type I to type I.t; fig. 3A and D), which was likely selected to favor the optimal 3\u2032-terminal configuration. Interestingly, a recent study associates HHR motifs with nonautonomous LTR retrotransposons, which may exist as short RNA circles (Cervera et al. 2016); however, all of those motifs belong to type III but not type I, differing in the topology of the open-ended helix, and possibly reflecting different structural requirements of PLE and LTR RTs.",

In our view, the most relevant biological feature is the unusual susceptibility of bdelloid telomeric regions to acquisition of foreign genetic material and amplification of foreign genes and host multigene families (Flot et al. 2013; Rodriguez and Arkhipova 2016). PLEs are unique in their capacity to retain introns after retrotransposition, which is also applicable to genes captured between pLTRs (Arkhipova et al. 2003, 2013). Retromobility of longer templates would be disfavored at internal chromosomal locations in the absence of a reliable integration mechanism, as it would largely depend on preexisting nicks or breaks. Bdelloid telomeres, however, apparently offer the opportunity to bypass intrachromosomal integration by supplying the exposed G-rich overhangs, and a TE which can take advantage of such overhangs for its proliferation can additionally provide the host with extra means of terminal DNA addition. The terminal attachment mode does not rule out occasional intrachromosomal integration events, which might be triggered by random DNA breakage or by the presumed nicking activity of GIY-YIG EN when present. However, such events would be rare in comparison with terminal addition, since the lack of RT-EN fusion eliminates the cis-preference effect based on cotranslational cis-recognition of structural elements near the 3\u2032-end of the template by the RT.",
