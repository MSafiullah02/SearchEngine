            "text": "\nKobuvirus is a relatively recently described genus of the Picornaviridae family. Human Aichi virus (AiV), its first member, was isolated from faecal samples of human patients with oyster-associated nonbacterial gastroenteritis in Japan in 1989 (Yamashita et al., 1991). Since then, AiV has been detected in many countries around the world, especially in outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters and other shell-fish, and in sporadic disease in children (Ambert-Balay et al., 2008, Kaikkonen et al., 2010, Oh et al., 2006, Pham et al., 2007, Reuter et al., 2009, Sdiri-Loulizi et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2009). Other members of the Kobuvirus genus have now been described causing enteric infections in cattle (Barry et al., 2011, Khamrin et al., 2008, Park et al., 2011), pigs (Barry et al., 2011, Khamrin et al., 2009, Reuter et al., 2008), wild boar (Reuter et al., 2012), bats (Li et al., 2010), sheep (Reuter et al., 2010) and rodents (Phan et al., 2011). Their role as a primary pathogen remains uncertain (Kaikkonen et al., 2010, Lorrot et al., 2011), and mixed infections are common (Ambert-Balay et al., 2008). Although detection of AiV itself is rare, seroprevalence of antibody to AiV is high in humans, approaching 100% in adults, suggesting infection is common (Ribes et al., 2010, Yamashita et al., 1993).",

The RNA molecule contains one large open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein which like other members of the Picornaviridae family is cleaved into structural and non-structural proteins. Initially two genotypes of AiV were identified based on differences of nucleotide sequence in the 3C\u20133D junction (Yamashita et al., 2000). More recently a third genotype type has been identified (Ambert-Balay et al., 2008). Some unique molecular features have been described compared to other picornaviruses. Yamashita et al. (1998) showed that the VP0 capsid protein is expressed in the mature particle in Aichi virus and does not undergo cleavage (Yamashita et al., 1998) in contrast to other picornaviruses (Hellen and Wimmer, 1992). Also the 2A and L protein of Aichi virus have no protease or autocatalytic motifs as documented for other picornaviruses and their function remains unknown (Yamashita et al., 1998).",

In a study of acute gastroenteritis in canine shelters in the United States, 5 of 18 dogs from two of three outbreaks tested positive for kobuviruses. Sequence analysis and distances from AiV genotypes A and B led the authors to propose these viruses be called canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) (Kapoor et al., 2011). In a separate study published around the same time, a similar virus was detected in the stools of three dogs with diarrhoea (Li et al., 2011). Based on sequence analysis, the canine virus was independently named CaKoV and tentatively classified as a novel species, closely related to AiV, in the genus Kobuvirus. Follow up PCRs of 200 sick and healthy dogs found CaKoV in 14 healthy and six diarrhoeic dogs. Both of these studies failed to identify a clear role for CaKoV in disease, suggesting that any pathogenicity was likely to be low, at least in the mostly adult canine population they tested.",

These viruses have been implicated in diarrhoeal disease but the evidence for a primary pathogenic role remains controversial. We report here the first observation of kobuvirus in the UK. The virus was discovered by next generation sequencing, a powerful tool for the detection of novel viruses (Radford et al., 2012). Although actual infection was rare in dogs with diarrhoea, the seroprevalence study for AiV cross-reactive antibodies in dogs and cats showed infection with kobuviruses to be common in both these species.",

The phylogenetic analysis reported here suggests one clade of canine kobuvirus is now present both in the USA (Kapoor et al., 2011, Li et al., 2011) and Europe. The CaKoV lineage is phylogenetically distinct from the three known AiV genotypes, and also other published kobuviruses, probably representing a single recent transfer into this species. Our failure to grow the CaKoV in various cell culture systems, is in contrast to AiV (Yamashita et al., 1991), and suggests these two viruses are currently adapted to independent niches, although clearly we cannot rule out the virus being inactivated during storage. These results suggest CaKoV is unlikely to pose a significant zoonotic risk. That said, it is clear that geography also plays a strong part in the human kobuvirus phylogeny, and it will therefore be important to sequence AiV strains from the UK, and/or canine strains from other countries.",

Both studies concluded there was no clear link between CaKoV infection and disease. These levels of infection are similar for those reported for other kobuviruses in sporadic disease (Ambert-Balay et al., 2008), and suggest these viruses either cause in apparent infection or are an uncommon cause of sporadic clinical disease in the general population.",

To our knowledge, there is no published data on the serological cross-reactivity between different members of the kobuvirus genus, nor between members of distinct AiV genotypes. Therefore the virological origin of the high seroprevalence detected in this study cannot be clear. For example, it is not known whether these seropositive animals represent kobuvirus infections that serologically cross-react with genotype A AiV, or whether they indeed represent previous AiV infections. Although published data generally suggests kobuviruses are host specific, some cross-species infections have been detected among farm animals (Khamrin et al., 2010, Park et al., 2011, Reuter et al., 2011), and clearly the lifestyle of some pet dogs and cats would provide opportunity for viral transmission between species (Chomel and Sun, 2011).",

Vero cells were infected with AiV and further incubated for 8 h. After washing and fixing the cells with methanol:acetone, they were incubated with each serum dilution, washed and IgG antibodies were detected using FITC-labelled appropriate secondary antibodies.",
