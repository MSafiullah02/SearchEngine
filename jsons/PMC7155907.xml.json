The virus particles have quite distinctive spikes of 9 to 12 nm in length, which gives the virus the appearance of a solar corona. When isolated and cultured in vitro, the virus can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 h.11 The 2019-nCoV virus is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat and can be inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. Ethyl ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform are effective in inactivating the virus. However, chlorhexidine has been found to be ineffective.3",

Even individuals who are infected but asymptomatic can shed the virus and play a critical role in its transmission.3 The vectors of transmission are respiratory droplets or close/direct contact. Aerosol propagation is also possible in the case of prolonged exposure to high concentrations of the aerosols in a relatively closed environment. Individuals of all ages are susceptible to 2019-nCoV. The elderly or those with major medical comorbidities are more vulnerable to become critically ill once becoming infected. By January 31, 2020, more than 20 pediatric cases have been reported in China. Fortunately, children often have mild clinical presentations.1,12",

            "text": "Based on current epidemiologic data, the incubation period of COVID-19 ranges from 1 to 14 days, mostly ranging from 3 to 7 days.1,13 The most common manifestations in patients are fever, weakness, and dry cough. However, a small fraction of patients present with nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea. Severe cases often develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the first symptom. In critically ill cases, it progresses rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure. The chest x-ray film or computed tomography imaging is characterized, in the early phase, by multiple small band film shadows and interstitial changes (obvious in the extranodal lung), which then develop into multiple ground glass shadows and infiltration in both lung fields. In severe cases, lung parenchymal pathology may occur, but pleural effusion is scarcely observed. Based on the clinical presentations, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, the severity of illness in patients infected with 2019-nCoV can be categorized as mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Currently, there is no effective drug to prevent its transmission or to treat infected patients. Patients in the mild category are managed mainly with rest or antibiotics if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected or evident. Severe and critically ill patients should be admitted to an ICU promptly because patients in this category often require respiratory and/or circulatory support.",
