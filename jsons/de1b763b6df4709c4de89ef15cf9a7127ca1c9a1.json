To curb the secondary spread of the epidemic, many public places were equipped with thermal imagers to check the body temperature. However, the COVID-19 pneumonia has concealed symptoms: the first symptom may not be fever, and can be shortness of breath. During epidemic prevention, many people tend to wear masks. Therefore, in this demo paper, we proposed a portable non-contact healthy screening system for people wearing masks, which can simultaneously obtain body temperature and respiration state. This system consists of three modules viz. thermal image collection module, health indicator calculation module and health assessment module. In this system, the thermal video of human faces is first captured through a portable thermal imaging camera. Then, body temperature and respiration state are extracted from the video and are imported into the following health assessment module. Finally, the screening result can be obtained. The results of preliminary experiments show that this syetem can give an accurate screening result within 15 seconds. This system can be applied to many application scenarios such as community and campus. The demo videos of the proposed system are available at: https: //doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12028032.",

Some respiratory infectious diseases such as COVID-19 have hidden symptoms, and the first symptom in many cases is not fever, but shortness of breath. For these infectious diseases, leveraging these symptoms to find infected people can stop the virus from spreading again and allow infected people to get timely treatment. At present, the single health portrait such as body temperature constructed by the existing screening technology has great limitations such as low detection rate and high missing rate.",

Respiration is one of the most significant characteristics of human vital signs. Among all the characteristics of respiration, respiratory rate and breathing patterns are particularly important. Studies illustrate that their changes are one of the earliest and major signs of many serious illnesses. So far, diverse studies have demonstrated that thermal imaging can be used to analyze the respiratory rate and breathing patterns [1] [2] . Hu et al. used thermal and visible imaging to achieving the noncontact and nonobtrusive measurements of breathing rate and pattern [3] . Therefore, we developed a remote respiratory infectious screening system based on portable thermal camera to help fight the current epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. The structure of our screening system is shown in Fig. 1 . It has the advantages of portability, low cost and easy operation. Through the 15-second detection window, this system can accurately determine body temperature and respiration state of people wearing masks, thus giving the screening result.",
