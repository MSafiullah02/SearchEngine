            "text": "The innate immune system is the first line of defense for organisms that possess an adaptive immune system. It relies on the presence of specific receptors able to recognize recurring pattern in molecules associated with pathogens but not with host cells, allowing discrimination between self and non-self. These receptors are named pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and recognized pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) to induce the expression of cytokines and chemokines that restrict dissemination, eliminate pathogens and instruct pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. In the recent years, tremendous advances in the characterization of PRR families, nucleic acid sensing, downstream signaling pathways and effector responses have revealed essential role of novel proteins and dynamic protein interactions network in the triggering of immune responses to intracellular pathogen such as viruses. In the near future, targeting specific regulators of PRR-mediated innate response to withdraw viral subversion mechanisms, and access to novel surrogate measurable effector markers, hold the promise of new panviral therapeutics that will minimize adverse effects associated with type I IFN therapy. This review briefly summarizes strategies and challenges of present and future targeted immunomodulatory therapies according to our increasing knowledge in regulation of innate immunity and of virus-induced immune host dysfunction.",

            "text": "Signaling PPRs include the major families of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). Pathogen sensing takes place in all nucleated cells to generate cell-intrinsic innate immunity and in professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) to promote specific adaptive immune responses. While TLRs sense PAMPs in the extracellular space and endosomes, RLRs and NLRs function as pathogen sensors in intracellular compartments [1]. Interestingly, only a few of the known 13 TLRs have the ability to recognize viral molecules: TLR3 for viral dsRNA, TLR7/8 for viral ssRNA and TLR9 for viral unmethylated CpG DNA. Three cytosolic sensors of viral RNA have been characterized thus far: RIG-I for the sensing of 5\u2032 triphosphate structure and blunt-end base paring, MDA5 for the sensing of long dsRNA and LGP2 a CARDless regulator of its counterparts [2]. Following their activation, the CARD domain of RIG-I and MDA5 interacts with the CARD domain of the signaling adaptor MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) [3\u2022\u2022]. Both TLR and RLR viral sensing pathways converge to activate IFN regulatory factor IRF3-mediated and IRF7-mediated type I IFN (\u03b1/\u03b2) antiviral response and NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory pathway [4] (Figure 1\n). Recent studies aims at better defining innate immune responses have identified several novel signaling and regulatory molecules [5]. Global proteomic analysis has further revealed signaling modules with high interconnectivity and adaptor proteins regulating signalosome assembly upon antiviral response and type I IFN production [6\u2022\u2022].",

Cytokines produced at sites of infection play a key role in the activation and differentiation of dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells, all major players of the innate immune response [8] (Figure 1). When mature DCs detect virus derived antigens, they migrate to the lymph nodes to present antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells, inducing their activation [9]. Thus, modulation of PRR-mediated antiviral responses can have important ripple effects on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the specific adaptive immune responses to maximize the therapeutic potential of immunomodulatory drugs [10].",

            "text": "Antiviral innate response must be tightly regulated in order to prevent uncontrolled production of cytokines that might have deleterious effects on the host. Type I IFN signature induced by PRR activation has been observed in diverse autoimmune disorders including diabetes, and is believed to play a role in the induction of chronic inflammatory disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. In the recent years, a better picture has emerged in the biology of regulators illustrating the existence of numerous negative regulators that often play a nonredundant role and target the same positive regulator [5]. Many negative regulators have been characterized that are either involved in direct interaction with PRRs, dissociation of adaptors complexes, degradation of signal proteins or transcriptional regulation [12]. Post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and ubiquitination) have emerged as key mechanisms to regulate innate immune responses. Degradation of signal proteins mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy systems plays crucial roles in negative regulation of TLR signaling, and unlike disruption of adaptors contributes to termination of signaling as these degradations are irreversible [11]. Examples include proteins SOCS and PIN1 that promote polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Mal adaptor and IRF3/7 respectively, to suppress type I IFN and antiviral responses. Recently, miRNAs have also emerged as fine tuners of innate immune responses, which target mRNAs encoding TLRs, intracellular signaling proteins and cytokines. Examples include miR-146 that targets IRAK1 and TRAF6, and miR-155 that targets MYD88, TAB2 and IKK\u025b [12]. Thus, targeting specific negative regulator of the innate immune response may offer a new immunotherapeutic strategy to treat a range of infectious and inflammatory diseases [13].",

            "text": "Cellular defence has evolutionarily challenged viruses that in turn have developed strategies to counteract innate immune response. Indeed TLR and RLR sensing pathways are fundamental targets for virus-encoded immune suppression. These viral subversion mechanisms include recruitment of ubiquitin proteasome system, mimicry of the host cell components and sequestration and cleavage of key components of the immune system. One notable example is MAVS adaptor that is targeted by numerous viruses through proteolytic cleavage by hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), human rhinovirus 1a (HRV1a) and GB virus B (GBV-B), through decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential by influenza A virus (FLU) or through inhibition of its interaction with RIG-I by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Processes of viral evasion are varied and are beyond the scope of this review, but are recapitulated in Figure 1 (reviewed in [14]). Importantly, host proteins targeted by multiples viruses highlight key players of innate immunity, which represent potential therapeutic targets to restore antiviral response and eventually cure cells from viruses. However, these specific viral evasion strategies must also be taken into account when developing immunomodulatory therapeutics to provide the greatest clinical benefits.",

Refinement of therapies was explored with the development of improved IFN molecules like consensus interferon (CIFN: a completely synthetic interferon) [20], albinterferon (a fusion protein between IFN\u03b12a and human albumin) [21] and Y shape interferon [22]. Recently, virus-induced type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb1-3: IL-29, IL28A, IL28B) have gained a lot of interest to treat viral infections since naturally occurring variants of the IL28B gene have been a major prediction factor in spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of HCV [23, 24]. Early clinical trials of recombinant pegylated-IFN-\u03bb1 in HCV-infected patients showed reduced adverse effects compared to IFN-\u03b1, likely linked to minimal expression of IFN-\u03bb receptors in hematopoietic cells [25, 26].",

The proof-of-concept of this approach was made with the AS04 adjuvant system that combines monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), an agonist of the TLR4 receptor and aluminium salt [36, 37, 38]. AS04 has been approved in prophylactic vaccine against HBV (Fendrix, GlaxoSmithKline) [39] and HPV 16 and 18 (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline) [40]. The mechanism of action of AS04 is mediated by a transient and local activation of NF-kB activity and cytokine production, thus providing an innate immune signal for optimal activation of APCs [41]. Other notable examples of adjuvants in clinical development are Heplisav and VaxInnate. Heplisav is a HBV vaccine comprised of an immunostimulatory sequence (ISS-1018, Dynavax Technologies) that targets TLR9 receptor and HBV surface antigen. In phase III clinical trials, Heplisav demonstrated earlier and higher protection with fewer doses than currently licensed vaccines [42\u2022]. VaxInnate Corporation is developing vaccines using highly conserved influenza immunogens fused to TLR5 agonist Salmonella typhimurium flagellin type 2 as an adjuvant to potentially protect against all strains of seasonal and pandemic FLU strains (VAX102, VAX125, VAX128 and VAX168) [43, 44, 45].",

Panviral therapeutics with a targeted therapy approach would be an ideal treatment for acute and chronic viral infections, either as a standalone treatment or in combination with DAAs. The major challenge in developing future immunomodulatory therapy will be to minimize adverse effects. The aggravation of psoriatic plaques in HPV-infected patients treated with Imiquimod illustrates that triggering innate immune responses can lead to uncontrolled activation of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, immunomodulatory molecules, such as peptidoglycans, that bind to multiple PRRs (TLR2, NOD proteins and peptidoglycan recognition proteins) increase the risk of undesired side effects. Development of therapeutics will require more extensive structural information of receptor\u2013ligand interaction to maximize the specificity and avoid undesired interactions.\n",

The mapping of an innate immune protein interaction network regulating IFNB1 has revealed signaling modules with high interconnectivity including MAVS, TBK1 and IRAK [6\u2022\u2022]. Each module interacts with many signaling proteins of the pathway offering multiple drug targets with specific immune effector function. Using a genome-wide RNAi screen assessing virus-induced IFNB1 transcription in human cells, we identified novel proteins and pathways capable of negatively and positively regulating innate immune responses (unpublished data). Comprehensive epistasis analysis of the various regulators acting at different steps of the antiviral responses from virus sensing, signal propagation/amplification up to feedback regulation, offers valuable information for selection of drug targets. In principle, strategies of targeted therapy could include small molecule-mediated activation of positive regulators or inhibition of negative regulators. An example of targeting a negative regulator could be the immuno-miRNA miR-155, which is induced by virus infection and downregulate MYD88, IRAK3, TAB2 and IKK\u025b gene expression to suppress TLR signaling [12]. Silencing miR-155 function using antagomirs or locked nucleic acid (LNA) in infected cells could potentially restore TLR signaling.",
