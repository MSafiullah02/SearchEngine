We retrospectively analyzed 91 randomly-selected children aged 0-17 years receiving care from birth in a large primary healthcare establishment in the city of Wroclaw in Poland. Respiratory tract infections were responsible for 25-40 % of all primary healthcare visits. The median of visits due to upper respiratory tract infections was 1.8 per year in all children and 2.0 per year in children 0-3 years old. Antibiotics were overused; the majority (57.4 %) of the respiratory infections were treated with antibiotics: acute tonsillitis in 90.7 %, bronchitis in 67.5 %, otitis media in 65.9 %, pneumonia in 60.9 %, non-specific upper respiratory tract infections in 25.8 %, laryngitis in 22.2 %, and sinusitis in 12.5 %. The higher the number of antibiotic therapies, the higher the total number of visits including visits due to respiratory tract infections. In conclusion, implementation of careful and responsible management of a rational use of antibiotics is urgently needed since a reduction in their use may lead to a decrease in the number of visits due to upper respiratory tract infections and a total number of primary care visits.",

Rhinoviruses with over 100 serotypes and accounting for 30-50 % of common colds are the most common etiologic agents. Coronaviruses are responsible for 10-15 % and influenza viruses for 5-15 % of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) (Zambon et al. 2001) .

Acute pharyngitis, a so-called sore throat, is a common element of respiratory infections. It is often the first symptom of URTI. When bacterial streptococcal etiology is suspected, acute tonsillitis is usually diagnosed. Acute rhinosinusitis is a symptomatic inflammation of the mucosa of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, without any clinically evident extension of the inflammation outside the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, usually accompanies common colds (Wald et al. 2013) . Acute otitis media is a viral or bacterial infection of the middle ear. Uncomplicated acute otitis media may accompany common colds. Many respiratory infections show a seasonal variation in incidence, for example influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics occur predominantly in the winter months, with a January-March peak (Wat 2004) . In Poland, primary healthcare for infants and children (below the age of 18 years) is provided by pediatricians or family doctors. In large cities, access to primary care is easy, free of charge, and children are usually cared for by a pediatrician.",

Fragmentary and incomplete information on the epidemiology of URTIs in children in Poland comes from single studies (Tranda et al. 2000) . Polish recommendations regarding the treatment of respiratory tract infections are based mainly on international data (Commission on Respiratory Tract Diseases, . It is less than reported in the literature. According to the most commonly cited authors, infants and school children suffer from seven to ten common colds annually (Johnston and Holgate 1996) . The explanation for this difference is self-treatment of generally benign URTIs, e.g., common colds without consulting a primary care physician. Since the symptoms of respiratory infection (sneezing, cough, or hoarseness) are well known by patients and their parents, self-diagnosis, followed by self-treatment, is common. Thus, the number of primary healthcare visits depends not only on the number of URTIs, but also on the threshold for consultation with a pediatrician, i.e., the willingness to consult the primary care physician and the ease of access to a healthcare establishment. Our results are more consistent with the results obtained in preschool children in Norway. In a study by Kvaerner et al. (2000) , URTIs were most common at the age of 4. During the past 12 months, 47.7 % of children contracted more than two common colds, 9.5 % of children experienced more than one bout of acute otitis media, 6.9 % had more than one tonsillopharyngitis episode, and 3.2 % had rhinitis weekly or monthly.",

This was not a surprise since visits due to respiratory infections were responsible for about 25-40 % of the total number of visits to primary care establishments in our study (median number of all visits was 32, median of all visits due to respiratory tract infections was 13, and median of visits due to URTI was 8). We also found that the age of the first visit due to URTI correlated with the annual indicator of visits due to URTI. Similarly, the age of the first antibiotic treatment correlated with the annual indicator of visits due to respiratory tract infections. The older the child at the time of the first antibiotic treatment, the less frequent the visits due to a respiratory tract infection were made. We think that the child's age at the time of the first visit as well as the age at the time of the first antibiotic treatment may be useful prognostic factors. This finding may be explained by reduced personal or environmental predisposition of a child to URTIs (e.g., not attending kindergarten) or by a higher parental threshold for visiting a pediatrician.",

We found a strong positive correlation between the indicator of annual overall antibiotic therapies and specifically therapies due to URTI and the indicator for visits due to URTI. Similarly, the annual indicator of antibiotic therapies due to URTI correlates with that for the total number of visits to the healthcare establishment. These correlations do not imply a causal relationship, but along with the results of previous large-scale studies by Otters et al. (2004) and Fleming et al. (2003) a conclusion can be drawn that a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic treatment may decrease the number of visits due to URTI. Otters et al. (2004) found, in a Dutch national survey, that decreasing antibiotic prescription rates in children paralleled a decline in the incidence of respiratory tract infections in general practice. Fleming et al. (2003) showed that a decrease in antibiotic prescription rates is directly related to a decrease in respiratory infections presented in general practice. Other explanations, like a decrease in the occurrence of URTIs in the general pediatric population or an increase in the threshold for consulting a pediatrician, are less likely because, in our study, we compared the same population of children over the same time. Another possible explanation of this relationship may relate to the influence of parents; those with a lower threshold for consulting doctors may be the same parents who insist on antibiotic treatment.",

The majority (57.4 %) of respiratory infections were treated with antibiotics. The most common non-specific URTIs were treated with antibiotics in 25.8 % of cases. The situation in Poland is similar to that observed in other countries. Antibiotic use is generally highest among children and about 70 % of all antibiotics are prescribed for URTIs in children (Finkelstein et al. 2000; Majeed and Moser 1999) . In our study, acute tonsillitis was treated with antibiotics in 90.7 % of cases, bronchitis in 67.5 %, otitis media in 65.9 %, pneumonia in 60.9 %, laryngitis in 22.2 %, and sinusitis in 12.5 %. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics contribute to the development of resistant bacteria and have been a major worldwide concern for many years (Neu 1992) . Results of studies conducted at the end of the twentieth century indicated that Polish primary care doctors overuse antibiotics in acute pharyngitis and URTIs (Windak et al. 1996; Touw-Otten and Johansen 1992) . In our study, 84.6 % of children were treated with antibiotics and the first ever antibiotic was prescribed due to respiratory tract infections in 65.9 % of them. The most common misuse of antibiotics is the treatment of viral infections (Mainous et al. 2003; Vaccheri et al. 2000; Nyquist et al. 1998; McCaig and Hughes 1995) .",

Acute pharyngitis is often the first symptom of an upper respiratory tract infection. Acute otitis media is the most common condition for which antibiotics are prescribed for children in the U.S., although viruses were detected in most cases, with or without bacterial involvement. Virus RNA was detected in 75 % children (35 % rhinovirus, 28 % RSV, 17 % coronavirus, and 5 % dual) (Pitk\u00e4ranta et al. 1998 ). In addition, middle ear effusion is commonly found in colds, but may not be clinically significant (Bollag et al. 1996) . Uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, without clinically evident extension of the inflammation outside the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, usually accompanies common colds. Although acute bacterial sinusitis is a relatively frequent complication of viral URTI or allergic inflammation, it possibly affects only 6-7 % of children requiring medical care for respiratory symptoms (Wald et al. 2013) .",
