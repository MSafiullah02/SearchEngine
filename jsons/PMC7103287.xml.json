Coronaviruses have also been isolated from bats, poultry and other birds (Cavanagh, 2005, Chu et al., 2006, Poon et al., 2005, Ren et al., 2006). On the basis of antigenic and genetic analyses, coronaviruses are divided into three groups (Gonzalez et al., 2003, Gorbalenya et al., 2004, Snijder et al., 2003). Group 1 viruses include human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV-229E) and NL63 (HCoV-NL63), canine coronavirus (CCoV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and bat coronavirus. Group 2 viruses are subdivided into group 2a which includes murine hepatitis virus (MHV), human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), and rat coronavirus (RCov), and group 2b which includes SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Group 3 viruses include avian viruses, such as avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and turkey coronavirus (TCoV).",

            "text": "Members of the family Coronaviridae are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with exceptionally large, polycistronic genomes (27\u201332 kb). The 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the genome comprises two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode the replicase polyproteins (pp) 1a and pp1ab (Ziebuhr, 2005). Expression of the pp1ab requires a \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshift during translation of the genomic RNA (Brierley et al., 1987). The two replicase polyproteins are processed extensively by two or three viral proteases encoded by ORF1a to generate up to 16 end-products termed nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to 16 and multiple processing intermediates (Ziebuhr, 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The N-proximal region of the polyproteins is processed by one or two papain-like proteases (PLpro), whereas the central and C-proximal region is processed by the viral main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) (Ziebuhr, 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The 3\u2032-proximal one-third of the genome encodes structural proteins and various accessory proteins. Genes encoding the four structural proteins present in all coronaviruses occur in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Brian and Baric, 2005, Lai et al., 2006). Some coronaviruses contain an additional structural protein, the hemagglutinin\u2013esterase (HE) protein which is located upstream of the S protein gene (Lai et al., 2006). In contrast to the replicase proteins which are directly translated from the genomic RNA, coronavirus structural and accessory proteins are expressed from a nested set of 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that also possess a common 5\u2032 leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome (Pasternak et al., 2006, Sawicki et al., 2007). The common 5\u2032 leader is fused to the 3\u2032 body segments through a mechanism that is presumed to involve discontinuous minus strand RNA synthesis to produce subgenome-length templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis, with the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) elements determining the fusion sites of leader and body segments (see recent review of Pasternak et al., 2006, Sawicki et al., 2007 for details).",

In this study, we determined the full-length nucleotide sequence of the ECoV-NC99 strain of equine coronavirus. The viral genome and proteome were analyzed and the predicted features of ECoV nonstructural, structural, and accessory proteins were compared to those of other coronaviruses. Synthesis of sg mRNAs in ECoV-infected cells was analyzed by Northern blotting. The leader\u2013body junction sequence in each sg mRNA was determined and the exact position of TRS used for synthesis of each sg mRNA was mapped on the genome.

Four stem\u2013loop structures (I, II, III, and IV) were identified in the 5\u2032 UTR and a short stretch of nucleotides that are part of the ORF1a (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The bulged stem\u2013loop III (96\u2013115) and IV (189\u2013208) closely resemble the stem\u2013loop III and IV that have been identified as replication signaling elements in bovine coronavirus and other group 2 coronaviruses (Raman and Brian, 2005, Raman et al., 2003, Wu et al., 2003). The 3\u2032 UTR of the ECoV genome comprises 289 nt (30,704\u201330,992) and contains a putative bulged stem\u2013loop structure (nt 30,703\u201330,770) and a putative pseudoknot structure (30,766\u201330,819) (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar putative bulged stem\u2013loop structure and pseudoknot structure have been identified in murine hepatitis virus and other group 2 coronaviruses; these have been shown to be essential for viral replication (Goebel et al., 2004a, Goebel et al., 2004b, Hsue and Masters, 1997, Hsue et al., 2000, Williams et al., 1999).",

The translation of ORF1a generates a precursor pp1a of 4,429 amino acids. Similar to other coronaviruses, translation of ORF1b involves a \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshift, generating a 7128-amino acid pp1ab. The ribosomal frameshift is assumed to be directed by two signals in the ORF1a/1b overlapping region: a slippery sequence 5\u2032UUUAAAC3\u2032 (nt 13,472\u201313,478) and a predicted downstream RNA pseudoknot structure (nt 13,484\u201313,559) (see Supplementary Fig. S3). The pp1a and pp1ab proteins are predicted to be proteolytically processed by viral-encoded proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1\u201316, Table 2\n) required for viral replication and transcription. By comparison to other coronaviruses, a number of putative functional domains are predicted in the ECoV pp1a and pp1ab and these are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table 2 (Gorbalenya et al., 1991, Gorbalenya et al., 2006, Snijder et al., 2003, Ziebuhr, 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2001). Enzymatic activities of nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15 have been experimentally confirmed for some coronaviruses (Barretto et al., 2005, Cheng et al., 2005, Guarino et al., 2005, Heusipp et al., 1997, Ivanov et al., 2004a, Ivanov et al., 2004b, Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004, Lindner et al., 2005, Minskaia et al., 2006, Putics et al., 2005, Putics et al., 2006, Seybert et al., 2000, Seybert et al., 2005, Tanner et al., 2003, Ziebuhr, 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2001). The 3CLpro (catalytic residues His-3333 and Cys-3437) is predicted to cleave the C-terminal half of the ECoV pp1a and the ORF1b-encoded part of pp1ab. The putative PL1pro (catalytic residues Cys-1078 and His-1229) and PL2pro (catalytic residues Cys-1675 and His-1832) are predicted to process the N-proximal regions of the ECoV pp1a (Fig. 1 and Table 2).",

These insertions and deletions are clustered at two regions: the Ac domain and the region between the PL2pro and the Y domain. The functional significance of these insertions and deletions is unknown as yet; however, the functions of PL1pro, PL2pro, and ADRP are not anticipated to be affected since insertions and deletions are not located in the functional domains of these enzymes (Fig. 1).",

The NS2 of ECoV has 67%, 67%, and 45% amino acid identity with the respective NS2 proteins of BCoV, HCoV-OC43, and PHEV. The lower amino acid identity with PHEV may be attributable to the fact that PHEV has a truncated NS2 protein (Vijgen et al., 2006). Sequence analysis revealed that the ECoV NS2 protein contains a domain (aa 46\u2013135) with similarity to the putative cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD, Martzen et al., 1999). The CPD domain has also been identified in the NS2 proteins of other group 2a coronaviruses as well as in the 3\u2032end of the pp1a protein of toroviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2006, Snijder et al., 1991, Snijder et al., 2003). The NS2 of ECoV was predicted to contain 9 potential phosphorylation sites. The NS2 of ECoV does not contain a signal peptide and is a non-secretory protein. The function of the NS2 protein in coronaviruses has not been studied in detail. It is known that the NS2 gene is non-essential for MHV replication in transformed cells (Schwarz et al., 1990). However, a recent study showed that a point mutation in the NS2 of MHV led to its attenuation in mice in spite of its wild-type replication in tissue culture (Sperry et al., 2005).",

An N-terminal signal peptide was identified with a potential cleavage site between amino acids 14 and 15 predicted by SignalP-NN or between amino acids 17 and 18 predicted by SignalP-HMM. The ECoV S protein was predicted to be a typical type I membrane protein with the N-terminal 1307 residues exposed on the outside of the cell surface or virus particle, a transmembrane domain near the C terminus (residues 1308\u20131330), followed by a cytoplasmic tail (residues 1331\u20131363). Following multiple alignments with the S proteins of other group 2a coronaviruses, a potential cleavage recognition sequence (RRQRR) was identified at residues 764\u2013768 which would predict a cleavage between amino acids 768 and 769, separating the ECoV S protein into S1 and S2 subunits (Fig. 1). The ECoV S1 subunit is expected to contain a receptor-binding domain whose position has not yet been determined. The S2 subunit is predicted to mediate membrane fusion. Two heptad repeat (HR) regions, which are conserved in position and sequence among the three groups of coronaviruses and play important roles in membrane fusion (see reviews of Eckert and Kim, 2001, Hernandez et al., 1996), were identified in the ECoV S2 subunit (HR1: aa 991\u20131092; HR2: aa 1259\u20131304) (Fig. 1). The ECoV S2 subunit is anticipated to possess a fusion peptide whose position is yet unknown. Some coronavirus S proteins have been shown to contain important neutralization epitopes (Godet et al., 1994, Kubo et al., 1994, Yoo et al., 1991) and mutations in the S protein have been associated with altered viral antigenicity and pathogenicity (Ballesteros et al., 1997, Bernard and Laude, 1995, Dalziel et al., 1986, Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001, Leparc-Goffart et al., 1997).

One potential N-glycosylation site was predicted at position 26 (NFS). The presence of potential O-glycosylation sites was predicted at the extreme N-terminus of the M protein (MSSTPTPAPGYT). Whether these sites are glycosylated or not needs to be experimentally verified. Previous studies have shown that the M protein of group 1 and 3 coronaviruses (e.g. TGEV and IBV) are N-glycosylated, whereas the M protein of group 2 coronavirus MHV is only O-glycosylated (de Haan et al., 2002, Lai et al., 2006).

However, the number of sg mRNAs and the characteristics and expression pattern of the proteins they encode (e.g. a sg mRNA may sometimes express multiple proteins) varies for each virus. In order to investigate ECoV sg mRNA synthesis, Northern blot analysis was performed to evaluate the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs in ECoV-infected cells. A digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe complementary to the 3\u2032 end (nt 30,660\u201330,946) of the ECoV genome was used for a Northern blot hybridization analysis. As shown in Fig. 2\n, nine mRNAs were detected in ECoV-infected HRT-18G cells at 72 h p.i. Absence of such mRNAs in mock-infected cells confirms that these mRNAs are ECoV-specific. According to the estimated sizes of the mRNAs, it is reasonable to assume that sg mRNAs 2\u20138 express the NS2, HE, S, p4.7, p12.7, E, and M proteins, respectively and that mRNA 9 expresses the N protein and probably the I protein as well.",

In order to determine the precise location of the leader and body TRSs used for ECoV sg mRNA synthesis, the leader\u2013body junction and flanking sequences of each ECoV sg mRNA were determined using sg mRNA-specific RT\u2013PCRs (see Table 3\nand Materials and methods for details). The sg mRNA sequences were aligned to the leader and corresponding \u2018body\u2019 genomes as shown in Fig. 3\n. Analysis of the leader\u2013body junction sequences revealed that the core sequence of the TRS motifs is 5\u2032UCUAAAC3\u2032. The leader TRS (5\u2032UCUAAAC3\u2032) and the body TRS (5\u2032UCUAAAC3\u2032) used for synthesizing HE mRNA, S mRNA, and N mRNA exactly match each other. There is one mismatch between the leader TRS and the body TRS (5\u2032UCUAAAA3\u2032) used for generating the mRNA of the NS2 protein. There is also one mismatch between the leader TRS and the body TRS (5\u2032UCCAAAC3\u2032) used for generating E mRNA and M mRNA. There are two mismatches between the leader TRS and the body TRS (5\u2032UUAAAAC3\u2032) used for generating the mRNA of the p4.7 protein. Interestingly, in the case of the mRNA of the p12.7 protein, the leader and the body segment is joined at the unusual consensus variant 5\u2032UAAACUUUAUAA3\u2032. Previously it has been shown that the mRNA of the p12.7 protein of BCoV also utilizes an unusual consensus variant for joining the leader and body segment (Hofmann et al., 1993). From the sequence data, we conclude that the ECoV common leader on sg mRNAs is the first 64 nucleotides of the ECoV genome.",

As shown in Fig. 5\n, the BCoV strains and HCoV-OC43 had lowest genetic distances over the complete genome; the genetic distance between PHEV and HCoV-OC43 was similar to the distance between BCoV and HCoV-OC43 in most regions of the genome with exception of the spike gene where the genetic distance of PHEV to HCoV-OC43 was significantly greater than the distance of BCoV to HCoV-OC43; the genetic distance of ECoV to HCoV-OC43 was significantly greater than the distance of either BCoV or PHEV to HCoV-OC43 in the regions of the first half of ORF1a, the central part of ORF1b, NS2 and HE genes; the genetic distance with respect to the spike gene between ECoV and HCoV-OC43 was similar to the distance between PHEV and HCoV-OC43 but greatly higher than the distance between BCoV and HCoV-OC43. The genetic distances of BCoV and PHEV to HCoV-OC43 observed in this study are consistent with previously reported findings (Vijgen et al., 2005, Vijgen et al., 2006). Vijgen et al., 2006, Vijgen et al., 2005 concluded that PHEV diverged from the common ancestor before BCoV and HCoV-OC43. Our analysis suggested that ECoV had diverged earlier than PHEV from a common ancestor. In summary, ECoV had emerged earlier than PHEV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43, notwithstanding the fact that ECoV was not isolated until 1999 from a diarrheic foal in USA.",

Briefly, intracellular RNA was extracted from ECoV-infected HRT-18G cells using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion). Reverse transcription was carried out with an RT primer located downstream to the body TRS region in a sg mRNA (Table 3) using SuperscriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Due to the nested nature of sg mRNAs, such an RT primer also binds to the corresponding positions in all larger viral mRNAs, including the genomic RNA. Subsequently, cDNA was PCR amplified with a forward primer (1P) located in the leader sequence and a reverse primer located just upstream of the RT primer in the body of the mRNA (Table 3). Amplification was performed in a volume of 50 \u03bcl: 5 \u03bcl PfuTurbo PCR buffer (10\u00d7), 0.4 \u03bcl dNTP mix (25 mM each), 1 \u03bcl of each primer (20 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcl cDNA template, 1 \u03bcl PfuTurbo\u00ae DNA polymerase, and 39.6 \u03bcl nuclease-free water.
