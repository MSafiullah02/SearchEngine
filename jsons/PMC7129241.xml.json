For example, high-density domestic dog populations are a more likely source of canine distemper virus (CDV) for infected African carnivores (Cleaveland et al., 2000). Moreover, because most individuals in an endangered population are seldom exposed to a pathogen, there is little acquired immunity, so when an epidemic occurs it tends to infect a large proportion of the population and mortality levels may be high (McCallum and Dobson, 1995).",

In spite of the serious consequences that an epidemic might have on the two remaining lynx populations, very little is known about diseases affecting the species. There is little evidence of contact with microparasites other than Toxoplasma gondii (Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006, Roelke et al., 2008). However, the lynx is susceptible to bovine tuberculosis (TB) (P\u00e9rez et al., 2001, Aranaz et al., 2004), and is known to host the protozoal blood parasite Cytauxzoon spp. (Luaces et al., 2005). Roelke et al. (2008) speculated that the lack of evidence of exposure of Iberian lynx to pathogens such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or CDV might make the lynx vulnerable to outbreaks of these diseases in the future. The lynx has reportedly experienced demographic bottlenecks and associated losses of genetic diversity that may exacerbate such vulnerability (Johnson et al., 2004). Inbreeding was recently proposed as a cause of the loss of effectiveness of the immune system in the lynx (Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006).",

The solitary social system of the Iberian lynx (Ferreras et al., 1997) may decrease the risk of intra-species transmission of viral agents, and lynx probably come in contact with these agents mainly during inter-species contacts.

We also found that PV was broadly distributed in the carnivore population. The tests we ran did not allow us to determine the strain of PV, canine or feline. In fact, current taxonomy defines canine PV (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus as a single taxonomic entity (Tattersall, 2006) and CPV was found to be responsible for about 5\u201310% of feline parvovirosis in cats in Germany (Truyen, 1999). Steinel et al. (2000) found CPV-2b sequences in five captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and concluded that the observed distribution of feline PV antigenic types in captive large cats suggested a transmission from domestic dogs. The overall carnivore population studied here might well share this virus with the lynx. On the other hand, titres to CDV were found in a remarkable proportion of dogs and foxes. The higher seroprevalence we detected in adult foxes when compared to juveniles indicates that the agent is probably enzootic in the fox population in Do\u00f1ana. Interestingly, we detected two seropositive cats, and the genome of CDV in a third one, which offers new evidence that interspecific transmission of CDV occurs (Harder and Osterhaus, 1997).",

Bovine TB was already known to affect the Iberian lynx (see, for example, P\u00e9rez et al., 2001), which is probably an incidental host (Mart\u00edn-Atance et al., 2006). In addition, evidence of exposure was found in three species of scavenger carnivores (fox, badger and mongoose) in Do\u00f1ana. Wild ungulates display high prevalences of TB in both areas (Aranaz et al., 2004, Vicente et al., 2006), which makes them the most likely maintenance host. In fact, wild boar (Sus scrofa) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) are believed to be TB reservoirs in Mediterranean Spain (Gortazar et al., 2006). The route of infection for the lynx is unknown, although (at low proportions) ungulates are part of the lynx diet (Delibes, 1980, Gil-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2006). Other potential sources of infection that must be investigated are contaminated water or soil. Since felines are very susceptible to infection by M. bovis, repeatedly contacts with the agent are probably not necessary for the lynx to develop fatal infections. The finding of a juvenile lynx with a generalised infection supports this hypothesis.",

High seroprevalences of T. gondii are commonly observed in free-living lynx species (Ryser-Degiorgis et al., 2006). Older lynx presented higher seroprevalences than juveniles, which may indicate that adult animals have an increasing probability of being exposed to T. gondii during their life-time, as has been observed in other lynx species (e.g. Ryser-Degiorgis et al., 2006). We did not detect oocysts in lynx faecal samples. Although it is accepted that all species of felids can act as a definitive hosts for T. gondii, Iberian lynx have not been shown to excrete oocysts demonstrating their role as a definitive host. Infection of the Iberian lynx probably occurs after exposure to infected prey, most probably rabbits (Almer\u00eda et al., 2004). Lynx may also become infected transplacentally, through milk or by ingestion of food or water contaminated by oocysts from cat faeces (see Roelke et al., 2008). In fact, 17% of cats sharing a habitat with lynx showed oocysts in their faeces, which could explain the high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection observed in all the analysed species.",

In fact, only TB has been reported to be lethal for the Iberian lynx (P\u00e9rez et al., 2001); this chronic disease may not cause substantial mortality but may extract individuals from the population with the subsequent loss of population size and genetic variability.

For other diseases (e.g. ehrlichiosis, chlamydiosis, neosporosis), little information is available regarding their potential pathogenicity in wild felids, and the relevance of the infections for lynx conservation needs to be elucidated.

However, to confirm this hypothesis, it will be necessary to fully identify and compare the strains of PV or FeLV, or the species of Chlamydophila spp. or Ehrlichia spp. present among carnivores in these areas. For example, if lynx are susceptible to CPV, the high prevalence of PV detected in the dog and fox may pose a risk for lynx conservation. It would also be necessary to clarify whether the positive result for CAV-1 is due to a cross-reaction or whether this canine virus is actually able to infect the lynx. In the case of Cytauxzoon spp., it has not so far been determined whether one or more strains or species infect the Iberian lynx and, in addition, the intermediate host has not been still identified in Spain (Mill\u00e1n et al., 2007a). On the other hand, our results indicate that other sympatric animals (and not only carnivores) such as wild ungulates (TB), rodents (L. interrogans) or rabbits (T. gondii) are probably also acting as maintenance host for pathogens, and this must be taken into consideration.",

According to the results from the questionnaires, there were on average three cats per owner, and neutering was never used to control cat populations. This implies that new potential hosts are frequently available for agent maintenance, as reflected by the high seroprevalence of FeLV in young cats. The lack of vaccination and neutering of domestic animals will assist in creating a rich environment for disease agents.",

With a high diversity of disease agents in the populations of sympatric carnivores, and the apparent lack of acquired immunity and immunocompetence, we believe that a disease outbreak among the local abundant carnivores may pose a serious disease risk for lynx conservation. Management actions are necessary to avoid a potential disease outbreak among sympatric carnivores that might affect the two remaining Iberian lynx populations. A campaign to control domestic carnivore populations (by vaccination, euthanasia, and/or neutering) would reduce the incidence of circulating pathogens. In addition, we believe that diseases have to be taken into account when planning lynx translocations or reintroductions (Wild et al., 2006). Disease-related issues should be carefully considered in endeavouring to optimise the conservation efforts targeted at endangered species such as the Iberian lynx.",
