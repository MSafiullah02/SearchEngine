Although the mechanism of SARS pathogenesis in vivo may involves both the effects of viral replication in the target cells and immune responses to viral antigens, there is a lack of molecular pathological data, including data regarding the signaling pathways of SARS\u2010CoV infection. As viral virulence and the mortality rate of SARS patients are very high, understanding the pathological mechanisms of SARS is important for the prevention of SARS.",

Many pro\u2010 and antiapoptotic proteins are involved in these pathways in cells. Several reports indicated that activation of physiological intracellular signaling cascades caused by SARS\u2010CoV infection leads to the phosphorylation and activation of downstream molecules. For example, mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are well\u2010known signal transducers that respond to extracellular stimulation by cytokines, growth factors, viral infection, and stress, and in turn regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis.\n15\n, \n23\n, \n40\n Recent studies regarding SARS and SARS\u2010CoV have clarified that activation of MAPKs plays important roles in upregulation of cytokine expression and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.

            "text": "Apoptosis, which is fundamentally different from necrosis, is an active and physiological type of cell death, which can be induced by viral infection, viral replication, and production of viral proteins. The monkey kidney cell line, Vero E6, is widely used in SARS\u2010CoV research due to its high sensitivity to infection with the virus. Several studies have shown that SARS\u2010CoV infection of Vero E6 cells induces apoptosis, detected by DNA fragmentation and caspase activation.\n28\n, \n42\n p38 MAPK is strongly activated by stress and inflammatory cytokines. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype coronavirus, was able to induce activation of p38 MAPK into virus\u2010infected cells.\n1\n p38 MAPK activation in CD14 monocytes was also observed in SARS patients.\n24\n Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was significantly upregulated at 18 h postinfection (h.p.i.) in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells.\n28\n Cytopathic effects of SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infection were partially prevented by adding the p38 MAPK\u2010specific inhibitor, SB203580, to the cells. Although p38 MAPK can promote both cell death and survival,\n10\n the results of inhibitor studies indicated that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway may be involved mainly in cell death in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells. Several downstream targets of p38 MAPK were phosphorylated in virus\u2010infected cells, and SB203580 effectively inhibited phosphorylation of these proteins in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells. MAPK\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK)\u20102, which is activated in response to stress and growth factors,\n12\n, \n13\n was phosphorylated in virus\u2010infected cells. Hsp\u201027, which is a substrate of MAPKAPK\u20102 and is known to show antiapoptotic activity by inhibiting apoptosome formation,\n14\n survival factors,\n20\n cAMP response element\u2010binding protein (CREB), and activation of transcription factor (ATF)\u20101, was also phosphorylated in virus\u2010infected cells. Phosphorylation of Hsp\u201027, CREB, and ATF\u20101 may induce an antiapoptotic environment in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells. Nucleocapsid (N) protein was able to induce phosphorylation of Hsp\u201027 and CREB in transfected cells as described below.\n36\n The translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), is known to enhance translation rates of cap\u2010containing mRNAs.\n16\n The phosphorylation of eIF4E was utilized to promote virus\u2010specific protein synthesis in the case of MHV.\n1\n Although the levels of phosphorylated eIF4E were increased by SARS\u2010CoV infection, the activated eIF4E was not advantageous for viral protein synthesis as demonstrated by the similar kinetics of viral protein accumulation in infected Vero E6 cells in the presence and absence of SB 203580. There may be other substrates of p38 MAPK that are inducible on apoptosis of Vero E6 cells caused by SARS\u2010CoV infection. As each downstream target molecule of p38 MAPK has a role in the induction of cell death or survival in response to SARS\u2010CoV infection, determination of the apoptosis\u2010inducible target molecules of p38 MAPK is important for the development of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV drugs.",

As STAT3 is a major transcription factor activated in response to cytokines, such as interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) and IL\u201010, inhibition of STAT3 signaling by dominant negative and antisense oligonucleotides against STAT3 resulted in decreases in cell viability and apoptosis.\n17\n, \n31\n Thus, STAT3 is thought to act as an antiapoptotic transcription factor. Although inhibitors of MEK and JNK had no effect on the phosphorylation status of STAT3 in virus\u2010infected cells, two inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580 and SB202190) partially inhibited dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr\u2010705, suggesting that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is upstream of Tyr\u2010705 dephosphorylation of STAT3 in Vero E6 cells. The level of STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser\u2010727 was increased in virus\u2010infected cells. Although the effect of Ser\u2010727 phosphorylation on the function of STAT3 remains unresolved, it was reported that phosphorylation of Ser\u2010727 of STAT3 negatively modulated its Tyr phosphorylation.\n6\n Interestingly, Tyr\u2010705 dephosphorylation and Ser\u2010727 phosphorylation showed almost the same timing in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells. STAT3 phosphorylated at Tyr\u2010705 was localized mainly in the nucleus in mock\u2010infected cells, whereas STAT3 disappeared from the nucleus in virus\u2010infected cells. As STAT3 acts as an activator of transcription in the nucleus, STAT3 may lack its transcriptional activity in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells, and thus result in a decrease in antiapoptotic activity in the cells.",

Akt has many downstream targets and it induces cell survival via phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor (FKHR) family, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u00df (GSK\u20103\u00df), caspase\u20109, and Bad.\n2\n, \n8\n, \n9\n In SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected confluent Vero E6 cells, Ser\u2010473 of Akt was phosphorylated at 8 h.p.i. and maximal phosphorylation was observed at 18 h.p.i., whereas phosphorylation of Thr\u2010308 was not observed. As Akt is thought to show its full activity when phosphorylated at both Ser\u2010473 and Thr\u2010308, the total activity of Akt may be low in Vero E6 cells.

The N protein, which is a 423 amino acid predicted phospho\u2010protein of 46 kDa with a short Ser\u2010rich stretch and a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal, is known to show little homology with molecules in other coronaviruses. The N protein has been shown to undergo self\u2010association through the C\u2010terminal 209 amino acid region\n35\n and was able to induce apoptosis of COS\u20101 cells in the absence of growth factors.\n36\n Both JNK and p38 MAPK were upregulated in the transfected cells, whereas ERK and Akt were downregulated. Activated p38 MAPK by N protein induced actin reorganization into cells in the absence of growth factors. The downstream targets of p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK\u20102, and Hsp\u201027, were phosphorylated in the cells as well as in the virus\u2010infected Vero E6 cells. Downregulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and fibronectin expression was observed due to N protein expression, supporting the hypothesis that apoptosis induced by N protein is caused by interference with the integrin signaling pathway, and that serum factors are able to inhibit apoptosis by maintaining the activity of FAK through alternative pathways. Caspase\u20103 and \u20107 were activated only in the absence of growth factors in N\u2010expressing cells. However, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, failed to inhibit caspase\u20103 activation. Thus, there are two independent functional properties of N protein, p38 MAPK\u2010dependent actin reorganization, and caspase activation. Another group showed that the levels of transcription factors, c\u2010Fos, ATF2, CREB, and FosB, are increased by expression of N in Vero and Huh\u20107 cells.\n18\n Spike (S) protein of SARS\u2010CoV also induced activation of AP\u20101 and IL\u20108 promoter, possibly via activation of MAPKs, in A549 and HFL\u20101 cells.\n4\n As high serum levels of IL\u20108 were observed in patients in the acute stage of SARS,\n19\n activation of the IL\u20108 promoter via AP\u20101 induced by S protein may explain these clinical observations. The binding of S protein to a viral receptor, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE)\u20102, may be a trigger for activation of these MAPKs.",

The control mechanisms balancing cell survival against cell death in vitro are important for understanding the pathology in vivo.

Both Akt and p38 MAPK are keys for determination of cell survival or death in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells in vitro. Activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and dephosphorylation of STAT3 via p38 MAPK induced by SARS\u2010CoV infection have partially proapoptotic roles in Vero E6 cells. On the other hand, the levels of Akt, which inactivates proapoptotic pathways, are too low to block apoptosis signaling pathways. As Akt activation is necessary to establish persistently infected cells that escape from apoptotic cell death on viral infection, Akt plays an important role in delaying apoptosis in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells.
