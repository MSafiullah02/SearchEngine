            "text": "The incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) vary across the world, assorted literature describes from 9.2 to 246 per million residents a year [1]. Since systematic SCI rehabilitation programs were introduced, mortality rates decreased and life expectancy increased among patients with SCI [2]. However, mortality rates and life expectancy vary in different countries. That is probably due to differences in early and long-term evaluation and treatment, employment, mobility aids, social and financial support, etc. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has a population of \u223c2 million on an area of 25 713 km2. The University Clinic for Traumatology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Reanimation, Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Center (TOARILUC), Mother Teresa, Skopje, FYROM, is a level one trauma hospital and the only public hospital treating patients with SCI in the country. In recent years, private hospitals also treating persons with SCI have been established in Skopje, but due to very high expenses, these services are out of reach for most citizens of FYROM. To our knowledge, there are no published studies on epidemiology, early evaluation and treatment of patients with SCI in FYROM. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate incidence, cause of injury, demography and SCI characteristics, acute phase mortality/survival, and early complications after tSCI among patients admitted to the University Clinic for TOARILUC. The findings may point to issues relevant for the prevention of tSCI in FYROM and also indicate problem areas that need to be improved in the acute care after SCI.",

In our sample, work accidents happened to individuals between 46 and 60 years of age and most frequently among workers at construction sites, and within agriculture. Therefore the use of safety lines and railings at the construction sites need to be enforced like other safety gear such as helmets, shoes, etc. Falls at the same level was the leading cause of SCI for the age group above 60, a trend similarly observed in developed countries with the aging population [20].",

We assume this is because our hospital has a long experience with critical ill patients and precautions were taken together with the use of antidecubital mattresses, to avoid pressure ulcers. We observed no association between NLI and pressure ulcers, which likewise was experienced by others [27]. Infections were common, as reported in other studies [28\u201330]. We observed that participants with more than 2 ICU days and between 10 and 20 ventilator days more frequently developed ventilator associated pneumonia, which also has been observed previously [31]. We have not observed other complications which are otherwise commonly reported, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [32\u201334], the patients were under constant monitoring for changes in hemostasis and the hospital use compression stockings and Clexane (40 mg \u00d71 s.c, continued up to 6 weeks). Furthermore, we did not observe instances of autonomic dysreflexia, a possible cause could be a high mortality rate among cervical complete SCI patients and short LOS. We registered only one urinary tract infection, we assume the possible reason is the frequent use of long-term antibiotic treatment during their stay at the hospital.",

Our mortality rate during the observation period of 2.5 months after injury exceeds even that of the first year mortality rate in neighboring countries. First year mortality rate after tSCI ranges from 0.6% in Turkey to 20% in Finland [1, 35]. In Thessaloniki the first year mortality rate was reported to be 20% [36], however they have excluded patients that died the first week of the injury. In our study, 75% of those who died in hospital were on ventilator support. Previous studies have shown that persons with SCI in the need of mechanical ventilator support have a reduced survival rate [34]. We reported 90% mortality rate among elderly (above 60 years of age) in line with other reports [35]. We had one patient with Bechterew\u2019s disease who died after 1 week at the ICU, and as shown previously [37] these patients are at higher risk of early death after SCI than those without this spinal condition. All in all the injuries reported in this study seem to be more severe than reported from other countries and hospitals, furthermore a combination of severe injuries (polytrauma, including severe head trauma) and complications, most likely contribute to the high inhospital mortality. The hospital personnel is highly educated and experienced in treating polytraumatised, still prevention is possible only if the reason for death is known. Autopsies are not routinely performed because of cultural believes in our country, although according to the law every death in a hospital should be further examined with an autopsy.",

This information is not official and is not in a written form. There was an agreement many years ago that the Spine Unit at TOARILUC will be the only hospital to treat tSCI in North Macedonia. The National Statistical Office was contacted as well, but they do not hold information related to the organization of the acute care of tSCI. In addition, there is an agreement that all polytraumatized patients to be admitted to TOARILUC. The authors cannot know if everyone adhere to this agreement. In recent years, private hospitals have been established in Skopje that are able to treat patients with SCI, but the cost is very high, thus excluding most citizens. To the best of our knowledge, private hospitals received acute patients with tSCI from Kosovo mainly, in addition to the five patients transferred from our hospital. A further advantage for the study is that all but one of the ISNCSCI assessments, all the clinical examinations and interviews were carried out by one person only (the first author) an experienced clinician with proper training in ISNCSCI, thus all the data are collected and analyzed alike.",

Due to high mortality and in-hospital complications, even though common complications like autonomic dysreflexia were not observed, we believe this study can raise awareness of their existence and help improve care of future patients. In addition, passive and lung physiotherapy is not established to the point of accomplishing success for all patients at ICU because of lack of staff. Therefore this is another important message from this study and could be an area for future intervention and research. Furthermore, there is no centralized rehabilitation center for SCI persons after they leave the acute clinic. To be educated about their new living condition and precaution measures for the skin, urinary tract etc., is a very important part of the comprehensive SCI treatment. Our findings indicate that preventive strategies should focus on traffic-, fall related-, and diving accidents, including the work related accidents. There is a relatively low yearly incidence of 13 SCI/million inhabitants, probably due to underreported deaths due to SCI at the scene of accident or at other local hospitals. We found a high in-hospital mortality rate of 32%, most likely due to the high degree of polytrauma among our patients. We observed that patients with extended stay in ICU developed more complications. Finally, the study points to the need for organized rehabilitation for SCI patients after discharge from the acute hospital.",
