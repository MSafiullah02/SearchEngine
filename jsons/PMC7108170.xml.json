However, previous studies found no reliable signs or symptoms to differentiate Mp infection in CAP from other etiology [5, 6], potentially because Mp infection was misclassified as infection when it was carriage. We recently demonstrated that the Mp IgM ASC ELISpot assay differentiates Mp infection from carriage [9]: While Mp DNA and/or IgM were also detected in 48% and 29% healthy control children (n = 21), all were tested negative by the Mp IgM ASC ELISpot assay [9]. Notably, the high Mp detection rate in CAP patients (46%) in this study may be related to the inclusion age of 3\u201318 years, in which Mp is most frequently detected [1, 2], and the coinciding Mp epidemic in Europe during the study period [25\u201328]. Prevalence estimates are important for translation of diagnostic study findings into clinical practice. When taking the Bayes theorem into account, the posttest probability of disease presence will be higher given a higher pretest probability or prevalence [29\u201331]. For proper implementation of a new diagnostic test into clinical practice, it is therefore necessary that the test will be assessed in the context of all the other diagnostic information that is available at the time point of testing.",

In our study, one-third of Mp-positive CAP patients were not treated with an antibiotic in vitro active against Mp, but all of these children fully recovered. The BTS guidelines advise that macrolide antibiotics may be added at any age in case of very severe disease or if there is no response to first-line empirical treatment [2]. Prior antibiotic treatment was associated with Mp CAP and included treatment with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in most cases. This supports that in patients that do not respond to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, Mp CAP should be considered [2, 7]. We did not find statistical differences in fever duration following CAP diagnosis, hospital length of stay, or recovery at follow-up between Mp-positive patients who did and did not receive antibiotics against Mp (data not shown). These findings support the need for future interventional studies assessing the effect of antibiotics for Mp CAP [1, 9, 37, 38].",

Despite limited numbers, this was even true for PCT and CRP of Mp-positive CAP in comparison to viral CAP (RSV) as a subgroup of Mp-negative CAP. Similar trends have been observed in previous CAP studies for CRP, WBC count, and ANC [23, 39\u201343], and recently for PCT with median levels from 0.05 to 0.19 \u03bcg/L in CAP considered to be caused by Mp [39\u201341, 44]. A study with conflicting results suggesting higher PCT levels associated with Mp may be hampered by diagnostics [45]. A PCT cutoff of <0.25 \u03bcg/L reached the best discriminatory power in differentiating Mp-positive from Mp-negative children with CAP, which is supported by previous studies [39\u201341, 44]. Only 1 Mp-positive patient had a PCT level of 0.55 \u03bcg/L and was above this cutoff.",

Second, mild cases may not have been referred to our tertiary center. Third, the study enrolled children from 3 to 18 years of age to reduce the probability of viral infection [9].

Biomarkers showed some differences between Mp-positive and Mp-negative patients in that Mp positivity was associated with low levels of CRP, WBC count, ANC, and PCT, particularly a PCT cutoff of <0.25 \u03bcg/L. However, the study size is small and even the best combinations of clinical features and biomarkers may not be reliable enough to be used as a diagnostic itself. Our data support that a combination of clinical features and biomarkers may help physicians in identifying patients at high risk for Mp CAP, which warrants further investigations in a larger cohort of children with Mp infection.",
