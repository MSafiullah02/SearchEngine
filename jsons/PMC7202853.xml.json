Novel technologies now allow video links, interactive resources, and electronic evaluations to be distributed by SMS (text) messages. Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease might be at particular risk from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the UK, advice for patients with these conditions has been coordinated by Public Health England, focusing on a high-risk group that requires strict social isolation (\u201cshielding\u201d).1, 2 Rheumatologists were presented with a 40-component physician-scored tool to risk-stratify patients under follow-up by the British Society for Rheumatology. They were also requested to advise patients on therapy, such as corticosteroid use, during sickness. A particular challenge in the UK highlighted by regulatory authorities is that, despite the use of electronic patient records, data about rheumatology patients are fragmented (prescriptions for biologics and some disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are electronically coded in secondary care patient records and comorbidities in primary care records), preventing centralised national identification of at-risk groups.3\n",

The final iteration included the score, an animated worked example, and information from regulatory bodies and specialist societies.4 We used an established educational e-learning tool to record and publish our online video (iSpring Suite, iSpring Solutions, 2019).5 For patient contact, we used an existing database of mobile phone numbers that had already been used to send SMS messages to our rheumatology cohort in the past 12 months (March 22, 2019, to March 22, 2020).",

This innovation was done alongside traditional methods of hand searching biologics registries and drug monitoring systems (for which we had several thousand patients in our cohort). The \u201cshielding\u201d letters to the highest risk groups identified by our manual record search were posted only by day 12, illustrating the delays inherent in traditional approaches. Our methodology might be subject to response bias, with only those patients who benefited choosing to complete our survey.
