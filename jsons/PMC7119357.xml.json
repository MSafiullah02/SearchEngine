The larynx is a complex structure composed of interacting elements of cartilage and muscle. Functions include phonation, air passage, and protection of the airway. The trachea is composed of a single complete cartilaginous ring (cricoid) and multiple incomplete rings along with loose connective tissue. The conducting portion of the airway undergoes multiple generations of arborization from trachea to terminal bronchioles, including primary (or main stem), lobar, segmental, and subsegmental bronchi and several generations of bronchioles. The remainder of the airway, or respiratory portion, includes additional divisions from respiratory bronchioles to alveoli. Variation in arborization secondary to asymmetric, dichotomous branching can result in a threefold difference in airway generations between basal and apical segments.22, 167\n",

Stratified squamous epithelium covers most of the epiglottis and vocal cords. Ciliated epithelium continues from the base of the epiglottis to the respiratory bronchioles. Mucous production is achieved by goblet cells and submucosal glands that are interspersed among the columnar cells. The movement of the cilia propels mucus and particulate matter (including dust and bacteria) toward the opening of the oropharynx. On descent into the respiratory tract, the amount of cartilage decreases, whereas the proportion of smooth muscle increases. The absence of cartilage and submucosal glands differentiates bronchioles from bronchi.29\n",

These exposures include changes in temperature and humidity as well as large and small particles (e.g., aspirated microorganisms and airborne toxins such as smoke and noxious gases). Defense of the respiratory tract is provided by a combination of physical forces and physiologic systems. Inhaled particles are deposited throughout the airway based on their size. Larger particles (> 10 \u00b5m) can be deposited by turbulence in the nasal passage, whereas smaller particles can be deposited further down on the mucous layer of the ciliated infraglottic airway.22 In addition to holding onto deposited particles, the mucous blanket provides a barrier for the epithelial lining of the airway against alterations in temperature and humidity. Cilia serve to propel mucus and trapped particles toward the oropharynx. Cough can result from the stimulation of irritant receptors located throughout the upper (URI) and lower respiratory tract. Cough is an important adjunct in clearing particles from the airway.22 Finally, cellular and humoral immunity are involved in respiratory tract defense. Immune cells (e.g., macrophages) circulate along the mucociliary blanket. These cells can remove small particles by phagocytosis, whereas immunoglobulins (especially IgA) can provide additional protection from infectious agents.",

These systems may be based on etiologic (e.g., infectious, noninfectious), specific microbiologic (e.g., viral, bacterial, and so forth), anatomic (e.g., laryngeal, laryngotracheal, laryngotracheobronchial, tracheobronchial, bronchial, and so forth) and temporal (e.g., acute, chronic, recurrent) features. It must be understood, however, that these divisions often may appear arbitrary and indistinct when applied in the clinical setting. Anatomic classification may not take into account the spread of inflammation and infection among adjacent elements of the respiratory tract (i.e., does laryngitis exist separately from tracheitis, tracheitis from bronchitis, bronchitis from bronchiolitis, or bronchiolitis from pneumonitis or pneumonia?). It is often difficult clinically to predict the extent of involvement in the respiratory tract. Likewise, classification into a specific microbiologic category may be difficult to accomplish by history and clinical examination alone. Multiple infectious agents can result in similar signs and symptoms, whereas a single agent can cause a spectrum of illness. Viruses such as parainfluenza, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause inflammation throughout the respiratory tract without consideration for any classification system.",

Their records revealed 951 instances of croup out of 6165 cases of lower respiratory tract infection (15.4%) reported during that 11-year period. The incidence of croup varied with age, with no cases reported in the first month of life followed by an increasing incidence during the first 2 years of life. The peak incidence was 5.60 per 100 children per year in boys and 3.66 per 100 children per year in girls during the 1-year-old to 2-year-old age group. After 2 years of age, the rate decreased and cases were uncommon in school-aged children. More than 80% of cases occurred in the age group of children younger than 5 years. Gender",

The classic findings are croupy cough and inspiratory stridor. Spasmodic croup traditionally has been differentiated from viral croup by the absence of fever and a characteristic onset at night.35, 71 In addition, some authors require that viral URI symptoms be absent to make the diagnosis of spasmodic croup,105 although others report that such symptoms may precede some episodes of spasmodic croup.33, 35, 56 There is ongoing debate whether spasmodic croup and viral croup are separate conditions or whether they represent different parts of a spectrum of disease.23, 176 Theories concerning the cause of spasmodic croup have included muscle spasm, allergy, and viral infection. Descriptions from laryngoscopy in spasmodic croup have reported a \u201cpale, watery edema\u201d35 in contrast to the inflammatory edema present in viral croup. Although the treatment for spasmodic croup is generally the same as for viral croup,35 spasmodic croup generally is considered less severe and may be more responsive to humidification therapy.56 Because of these perceived differences between spasmodic and viral croup, failure to distinguish between the two conditions has been a consistent criticism of therapeutic trials for croup.170\n",

For the primary care physician, the typical case of croup is a clinical diagnosis rather than a pathologic (histologic or anatomic) or microbiologic diagnosis. The goal of additional testing is to rule out more worrisome causes when the diagnosis of viral croup is in doubt. As with any illness, the severity or toxicity of the child will influence the likely causes, as well as the appropriateness of further diagnostic evaluation and therapy. Children with suspected epiglottitis or who are otherwise at risk of impending airway obstruction should be managed in a controlled setting by individuals skilled in airway management. In these patients, it is crucial that delays caused by additional diagnostic maneuvers be minimized.

If performed, lateral neck roentgenograms have been shown to have a high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (92%) for laryngotracheobronchitis when adequate studies are interpreted by experienced radiologists.125 There was no correlation between radiologic findings and clinical outcomes, however, although \u201cuninterpretable\u201d films (13%) were associated with increased clinical severity.125 The frequency in which roentgenograms are obtained is likely to depend on the clinical setting, frequency in which croup is encountered, and confidence of the physician in making a clinical diagnosis. Plain films of the neck (anteroposterior [AP] and lateral\u2014cost = $171) can help confirm the diagnosis of laryngotracheitis (air trapping and dilated hypopharynx, steeple sign secondary to subglottic narrowing) or help rule out epiglottitis (thumb sign, thickened aryepiglottic folds), retropharyngeal abscess, or a radioopaque foreign body. The chest radiograph (AP and lateral\u2014cost = $187) may show the steeple sign on AP view. Other roentgenograms can be obtained, including decubitus films or expiratory/inspiratory films if foreign body aspiration is suspected.",

A careful physical examination can determine the degree of distress as well as detect evidence of fatigue. Croup scoring systems have been devised to serve patient care and research purposes. In both settings, croup scores attempt to create objective measures of disease severity that allow comparison between serial assessments. Ideally, scores can assist in quantifying respiratory distress, selecting initial therapy, determining response to therapy and requirement for additional therapy, and eventually in determining patient disposition (discharge or admission). An example of one such scoring system is shown in Table 1\n.

Choosing the site where a child is most comfortable (e.g., in the arms of a parent compared with the confines of a mist tent filled with cool or warm mist) is an important but overlooked intervention. When humidifiers are used in the home, cold humidifiers often are recommended to avoid the risk of burns to small children. In addition, families should conduct regular cleaning and maintenance of humidifiers to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi.161\n",

Benefits may be mediated by a reduction in the local inflammatory reaction (including lymphoid tissue) and capillary permeability, resulting in decreased subglottic edema.160 In addition, corticosteroids may block allergic and immunologic responses.160 The rapidity with which corticosteroids have been reported to act in some studies suggests other undescribed mechanisms also may be responsible.",

Controversy exists, however, because subsequent prospective trials have yielded mixed results\u2014i.e., not all studies have shown improvement following corticosteroid administration when compared with placebo. Tunnessen and Feinstein170 cite several reasons for the controversy over corticosteroid use and the conflict in study results. These reasons include (1) the lack of complete diagnostic classification (specifically, not differentiating viral from spasmodic croup), (2) inadequate dosing regimens, and (3) the lack of \u201cclinically relevant\u201d outcomes. A later study tried to address at least one of these concerns by specifically comparing patients with spasmodic croup and acute laryngotracheitis.105 The sole outcome measure was respiratory rate during sleep during a 6-hour observation period following the administration of dexamethasone or placebo. No difference was noted between dexamethasone recipients and controls in the combined group (spasmodic croup and acute laryngotracheitis) or the acute laryngotracheitis-alone group. When analyzed separately, however, the patients with spasmodic croup who had received dexamethasone had significantly lower respiratory rates than the controls.",

A similar prospective study103 of nebulized budesonide in outpatients resulted in a reduced croup score, earlier discharge home from the emergency department, and a lower hospitalization rate. Seventy-eight percent of the placebo group and 56% of the budesonide group also had received dexamethasone during the study or in follow-up, however. A comparison of oral dexamethasone versus nebulized budesonide versus no steroid therapy in hospitalized croup70 revealed a shorter time to reduction in croup score, shorter duration of hospitalization, and less frequent requirement for epinephrine after 1 hour in both treatment groups relative to the placebo group. In their follow-up study,71 the same group reported that oral dexamethasone was easier to administer than nebulized budesonide and, based on their initial study, currently use oral dexamethasone. Budesonide is not available in the United States as a medication for nebulization. A recent randomized, double-blind study93 using nebulized dexamethasone found a statistically significant improvement in croup scores at 4 hours. Improvement at 24 hours as well as hospitalization rates did not differ from the placebo group, however.

Despite this, the use of corticosteroids in such settings has been found to be common. In the survey26 from SUNY Health Science Center, 68% (sometimes 64%, always 4%) used them in outpatients. In 1995, the first prospective study31 of corticosteroids in outpatients with croup was reported. In this study, a single intramuscular injection of dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg) or normal saline was administered to patients who were to be discharged home from the emergency department. At follow-up, fewer dexamethasone-treated patients had received additional medical care (5% versus 21%; not statistically significant) and parents were more likely to report improvement at 24 hours in the treated group (84% versus 42%). The time to complete improvement was the same in both groups (mean of 3 days), however.",

A case of candida laryngotracheitis has been reported in an infant who was treated with corticosteroids and antibiotics.17 With the increasing outpatient use of systemic corticosteroids in a variety of conditions (e.g., asthma), studies have tried to address the infectious risks of such patients. One study43 looking at \u201csevere\u201d varicella (defined as development of new lesions after 14 days or evidence of viral disease extending outside the skin and mucous membranes) calculated a 178-fold increase in risk in steroid recipients compared with the general population. Lastly, when similar doses of dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg/d, divided every 6 hours) were used for 4 days in patients with bacterial meningitis (N = 102), two children experienced heme-positive stools and two additional children had episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding that required transfusion.110\n",

            "text": "In summary, there are many studies that provide evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids in croup. Controversy still exists, however, concerning the effects on clinically significant outcome measures (requirement for hospitalization, requirement for subsequent medical visits, duration of hospitalization, and requirement for intensive care therapy and intubation). There is also difficulty related to patient selection, including the ability to differentiate viral from spasmodic croup and how this can influence the response to various interventions. The task of appropriate selection of patients for therapy will move from research protocols to individual physician offices, and prospective data from the outpatient setting is just beginning to be reported. The onset of action of corticosteroids is believed to be within hours, and a reduction in croup score at 12 hours has been a common outcome measure reported by studies.97 Onset of action of systemic corticosteroids before 12 hours is not well documented, although studies with nebulized budesonide have reported benefits as early as 1 to 2 hours.70, 89 The optimal number of doses of corticosteroids by any route is unknown, and there have been no prospective comparison trials of single versus multidose protocols.26 The long half-life of dexamethasone (3672 hours)73 and the relatively short duration of symptoms in typical croup may fav\u00f6or use of a single administration. It is possible, but unproven, that a single dose administration also may reduce the risk of adverse effects.31 A variety of dosages and dosing regimens exist in pediatric textbooks. Recent recommendations for dexamethasone in croup or airway edema include 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg/dose (every 6 hours as necessary),92 0.5 mg/kg (single dose),57 0.5 to 0.6 mg/kg,78 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/d (divided every 6 hours),162 and 0.6 to 1 mg/kg (single intramuscular or intravenous dose).16\n",

Published accounts using racemic epinephrine for the treatment of infectious and postintubation croup first appeared in the 1960s from the anesthesia group at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah.01, 96 Following the introduction of racemic epinephrine, this group reported fewer tracheotomies (a decrease from 7% to none) and fewer as well as shorter hospitalizations despite increased hospital visits for croup. After this impressive debut, however, racemic epinephrine was found to have limitations. A prospective, placebo-controlled study by Gardner et al68 failed to show a reduction in duration of hospitalization or tracheotomy rates between the treatment and control groups. In addition, it was found that the immediate effects of racemic epinephrine could wane between 20 minutes and 4 hours. In his review, Skolnik149 cites five prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies61, 68, 108, 164, 176 assessing racemic epinephrine, with all except Gardner et al68 concluding that racemic epinephrine was effective in reducing symptoms of airway obstruction. It has been suggested that Gardner et al68 failed to show benefit because they did not exclude patients who responded to simple mist therapy.61, 176 Although most early studies administered epinephrine by intermittent positive-pressure breathing, nebulized epinephrine has been shown effective.61 Although Gardner et al68 showed no benefit from nebulized therapy without intermittent positive-pressure breathing, a prospective trail 61 specifically comparing nebulized and intermittent positive-pressure breathing racemic epinephrine showed similar, significant benefits in both treatment groups. Skolnik149 recommended nebulization over IPPB administration because of a lack of evidence showing superior effects of intermittent positive-pressure breathing.",

Because it has been known that the active form of epinephrine was the L-isomer (30 times more active than the D-isomer),175 there was reason to believe that 1% L-epinephrine could be as effective as 2.25% racemic epinephrine in croup.50, 164, 176 Waisman et al175 compared racemic epinephrine with L-epinephrine in a randomized, double-blind study in 31 children with acute laryngotracheitis. This study showed similar improvements in croup scores and respiratory rates in both treatment groups. There were no differences in heart rate or blood pressure recordings between the two groups.

            "text": "The decision to administer antibiotics in croup undoubtedly is influenced by the patient's severity of illness as well as the physician's suspicion of bacterial infection. The acute LTB observed in the first half of this century was a bacterial infection (diphtheritic and nondiphtheritic) associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Once antibiotics were available (initially sulfa-based and subsequently penicillins), they soon became an essential part of the therapy for these life-threatening infections.113, 131 Various factors already discussed have resulted in the appreciation for the changing microbiology of croup. The croup commonly encountered by physicians today is predominantly a viral infection. The continued administration of antibiotics in children with croup is common, however, despite this realization and admonitions to limit their use.113 Physicians may feel obliged to consider antibiotics because of concerns over preventing or treating bacterial infection or superinfection. Although case series of bacterial tracheitis have reemerged in the past 2 decades, it is still an uncommon entity that may have some distinguishing characteristics from viral croup (see following discussion). Also, reports66, 153 on the use of prophylactic antibiotics in presumed viral URI have not shown benefit. Conclusions of a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials on antibiotic use in URI and prevention of lower respiratory infections showed no shortening of the duration of URI and no prevention of developing pneumonia. A study137 comparing antibiotic use in croup at three different hospitals (a children's hospital, an urban general hospital, and a rural community hospital) found that the \u201cinappropriate\u201d use varied from 6% at the children's hospital, to 38% at the urban hospital, and 63% at the community hospital. There was no increase in morbidity reported from the children's hospital where antibiotic usage was lowest. Similarly, another study165 showed no difference in outcomes in viral croup following implementation of an educational program that reduced the antibiotic use from 93% to 22%. In general, experts56, 149 agree that antibiotics are not indicated in the routine treatment of viral croup.",

Comparison of current rates with figures from the beginning of this century are confounded by the different clinical entities described by the croup syndrome (epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, and viral laryngotracheobronchitis). In addition, many new therapies introduced during this century (e.g., immunizations, racemic epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphtheria antitoxin, antibiotics, and intubation techniques) also have influenced the outcomes of the croup syndrome. From relatively recent epidemiologic studies, only a small percent of patients with viral croup will require hospitalization, although reports range from 1.26%38, 39 and 19% in outpatient populations.64 Other reviews of croup have reported a hospitalization rate of less than 5%.33 Of the hospitalized patients, it has been estimated that less than 10% of hospitalized patients will require services in an ICU and less than 1% will require intubation.01, 33 A recent report of croup cases at a single hospital during a 7-year period ending in December 1992 showed a decrease in patients admitted to the ICU and a decrease in intubations, despite an increase in emergency department visits and total hospital admissions for croup.122 Corticosteroid and nebulized epinephrine use had increased at the study center during this time period.

Additional laboratory tests usually are not required to assist in diagnosis or treatment of typical cases. Primary care physicians are faced with the challenge of selecting appropriate therapies for patients. These decisions are made more difficult by the increasing number of available therapies and the controversies surrounding most therapies for viral croup. Humidification has significant anecdotal support and probably little risk if tolerated well by the patient. Dexamethasone as a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg administered parenterally has been supported by clinical research. Likewise, racemic epinephrine can reduce symptoms acutely but with a risk of rebound 2 hours later. Combinations and modifications of these therapies, including dosage and route of corticosteroids, and use of L-epinephrine in the place of racemic epinephrine will probably continue to generate interest. The use of these therapies in the outpatient clinic requires physicians to focus on optimal patient selection, extended observation periods, and the need for close follow-up. It is left to the individual physician to select the appropriate therapy based on an understanding of the scientific literature as well as personal experience and expertise. In addition to disease severity, the importance of other patient factors such as the proximity to medical care, access to car and telephone, compliance, and the observation skills of the family cannot be underestimated. The potential risks and benefits of each intervention need to be considered on a case by case basis.

These two separate case series almost certainly describe the same condition whose distinguishing characteristic is an inflammatory exudate usually associated with isolation of a pathogenic bacteria. In comparing reports that used endoscopic/pathologic versus microbiologic nomenclature, the principal difference was the isolation rate of bacterial organisms. Studies reporting membranous and pseudomembranous LTB were more likely to include cases in which no bacterial agent was isolated. By definition, reports on bacterial tracheitis included only those cases in which a bacterial agent was identified by Gram's stain or culture.",

Other conditions besides viral infection have been associated with bacterial tracheitis. Bacterial tracheitis has been reported as a complication of airway procedures, including intubation and tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy.11, 49, 51, 54, 145 Local tissue injury induced by the endotracheal tube may allow bacterial adherence to the trachea in the same manner as viral infection. This model has been shown in ferrets following endotracheal intubation.144 Other host conditions such as Down syndrome may predispose to bacterial tracheitis. Three studies18, 45, 117 have reported a total of seven patients with Down syndrome. Defects in cellular and humoral immunity as well as anatomic abnormalities of the airway may result in a higher incidence of bacterial tracheitis in patients with Down syndrome.45\n",

Another report126 using culture and serology techniques documented influenza B or parainfluenza 2 infection in each of eight children with bacterial tracheitis. Donnelly et al41 identified virus by culture in five of eight cases (parainfluenza 1\u2014[2], parainfluenza 2\u2014[2], influenza B\u2014[1]) of bacterial tracheitis. Clusters of cases of bacterial tracheitis have been reported in association with community outbreaks of parainfluenza and measles. Liston et al117 recovered parainfluenza type 1 in six of seven viral throat cultures from cases of bacterial tracheitis that occurred during a 2-month-long community epidemic of parainfluenza. Similarly, Conley et al25 reported nine patients with concurrent measles and bacterial tracheitis (measles-associated bacterial tracheitis) that occurred during an epidemic of measles between August 1989 and April 1990. In contrast to these studies, Sofer et al151 failed to identify any viral agents by culture or serologic assay in all five attempts.",

Early symptoms mimic viral croup; however, its subsequent course is typically more severe and suggestive of epiglottitis. Respiratory symptoms generally are not amenable to the conventional therapies for viral croup (including humidification and racemic epinephrine). Close monitoring of the airway is the principal therapy, and intubation or tracheotomy usually has been required to prevent obstruction by purulent exudate in the trachea. Antibiotic therapy is directed toward the likely pathogens. Because of the overlap in symptoms with viral croup, physicians need to consider bacterial tracheitis in the differential diagnosis of children with stridor. Suspicion should be even higher in those children who appear unusually ill or who fail to respond to the usual medical therapies for croup.",

Because of this, early epidemiologic reports72, 112, 154, 177 on bronchitis may have included episodes of acute asthma. Several epidemiologic surveys in the United States and United Kingdom have investigated the changing frequency of asthma and bronchitis diagnoses. Rates of both diagnoses increased during an 11-year period (1976\u20131987) reviewed by the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre of the Public Health Laboratory Service.06 Based on the simultaneous increases, the authors suggest that the rise in asthma rates in recent years is real and not the result of changes in diagnostic labeling. In contrast, hospitalization discharge rates from 1979 to 1987 collected from the National Hospital Discharge Survey72 showed an increase in asthma admissions and a decrease in bronchitis admissions. There has been speculation that recent increases in asthma incidence are the result of more willingness on the part of health care workers to diagnose asthma in children. It has been suggested that primary care physicians may use the diagnosis of bronchitis as a way to avoid labeling a child with asthma.154\n",

In addition, viral infections may be responsible for initiating episodes of chronic and recurrent bronchitis. Similarly, there has been increasing interest in documenting the role of viruses in exacerbations of asthma. A recent study94 in school-aged children used sophisticated viral detection techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and serology) to determine how often respiratory viral infections accompanied exacerbations of asthma. Of the 108 children who completed the longitudinal study, \u201ccommon cold viruses\u201d (e.g., rhinovirus and coronavirus) were detected in 80% to 85% of asthma exacerbations. It is possible that chronic and recurrent bronchitis are manifestations of the spectrum of childhood asthma.136, 178 Therapeutically, because of the possible close relationship of recurrent and chronic bronchitis and asthma, a trial of bronchodilator therapy may be indicated.74\n",

A history of sputum production and the presence of rales or rhonchi on examination were associated more commonly with a diagnosis of bronchitis. Each characteristic was present at most in slightly more than one third of patients, however.

In addition, M. pneumoniae has been identified in older children with acute bronchitis.20 It has been suggested that diagnosing bronchitis may be a method of justifying antibiotic therapy by the physician.173 This can help explain why more than 70% of children diagnosed with bronchitis were treated with an antibiotic in one study.173 Experts16, 22, 38, 56, 77 uniformly oppose the use of antibiotics in the usual, uncomplicated case of bronchitis. Only in the minority of cases, when nonviral cause is strongly suspected, should empiric therapy be begun. This may be in cases with \u201cprominent\u201d77 or recurrent fever56 or in cases in which symptoms persist without improvement for 156 to 2 weeks.22, 77 Risk of infection with M. pneumoniae may be increased in older children and during community outbreaks.

The diagnosis of an infectious process that primarily is isolated to the bronchi is difficult to confirm in the outpatient clinic. Signs and symptoms as well as typical screening laboratory tests (e.g., CBC and CRP) are nonspecific. More invasive diagnostic procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy) are unreasonable in cases that typically are benign and self-limited. From the data that exist, acute bronchitis is most often the result of a viral infection (e.g., RSV and parainfluenza and influenza viruses). In those patients in whom this diagnosis is made, therefore, the therapy is generally supportive. Antibiotic therapy probably is indicated only in those few cases that are unusually prolonged or severe.",
