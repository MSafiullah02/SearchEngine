In addition to syndromic surveillance, a number of informal digital resources have been developed. These systems are based on data collected through media sources such as news reports on the Internet, mailing lists, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds. The role of such systems at all stages of the epidemic remains unclear.",

In this regard, they complement each other with respect to information completeness. There is evidence in the literature on the systems' usefulness in communicating information to public health professionals, as well as to the general public during and after previous epidemics. Retrospective studies of some systems have shown a theoretical decrease in the time of epidemic detection compared to conventional surveillance. However, there is no evidence of the ability for real-time detection.",

            "text": "Google Flu Trend is designed by Google Internet Company to be a near real-time tool for detection of influenza outbreaks. Google Flu Trend exploits the fact that millions of people worldwide search online for health-related information on a daily basis. The tool was designed based on the assumption that there is an association between the number of people searching for influenza-related topics and the number of people who actually have influenza symptoms, and therefore, an unusual increase in the number of people searching for influenza-related topic on the web may simulate an increase in influenza syndromes. Studies performed by Google and Yahoo have shown that plotting data on searches using influenza-related keywords has led to an epidemic curve that closely matched the epidemic curve generated by traditional surveillance of influenza [4] . Google Flu Trends analyzes a fraction of the total Google searches over a period of time, and extrapolates the data to estimate the search volume. The information is displayed in a graph called \"search volume index graph\". It is claimed by the tool's designers that, according to tool testing, it can detect outbreaks of influenza 7-10 days before it is detected by conventional CDC surveillance [4] .",

However, evidence of such ability in real time is sparse and unclear. Chan et al. [8] have analyzed the average interval between the estimated start of the outbreak to the earliest date of discovery and publication, using WHO confirmed outbreak reports, as well as ProMED-mail, GPHIN and Healthmap reports. Analysis showed a decrease in intervals over 14 years, which was partially attributed to the emergence of informal digital resources [8] . A retrospective study of Argus reports on respiratory disease in Mexico showed a significant increase in reporting frequency during the 2008-2009 influenza season relative to that of 2007-2008. The authors suggest that, according to these retrospective results, respiratory disease was prevalent in Mexico and reported as unusual much earlier than when the H1N1 pandemic virus was formally identified. However, its connection with the 2009 pandemic is unclear [20] . The Google Flu Trends tool was also retrospectively tested. According to retrospective testing, influenza epidemics can be detected by using Google flu trends tool 7-10 days before it is detected by conventional surveillance [6, 7] , however, there are still no prospective evidence to such capability. A retrospective study from China reported that Google flu trend search data are correlated with traditional methods of surveillance [14] . Another retrospective study tested the real-time detection ability of six informal digital systems, including Argus, BioCaster, GPHIN, HealthMap, MedISys and ProMED-mail. Data from these systems were used to detect epidemics and compared to official data. Results suggested that all tested systems have shown retrospective real-time detection ability. Moreover, it was found that the combined expertise amongst systems provided a better early detection [3] .",

The fact that the number of subscribers to digital systems is increasing each year [15] makes these systems an efficient tool for globally spreading the information, as well as a tool for epidemiological investigation, complementary to official data.

The formal process of detection includes receiving the information, processing the information and using the information. The early digital systems reports were not used in any of the detection phases and did not change the process. It may be viewed as an analogue to screening tests which are effective only if they are capable of changing the natural history of a disease.

First, most systems accumulate a huge mass of information on a large variety of diseases, making it difficult to extract critical information. In other words, no integration of the information is performed to yield useful information. The challenge is to present critical information clearly and concisely. Second, digital systems are less specific than traditional surveillance systems, mostly due to false alarms, misinformation and information based on rumors [9, 17] . Therefore, they may not be solely used but as a complementary tool for traditional surveillance systems [17] . A third limitation is the lack of a response system to early warnings. With the lack of such a system, early warning is not useful, as no practical action is followed by the publication of the information. Such a response system may include triggers and decision criteria, which would lead to an appropriate and proportionate response to the threat [17] .",

As a result, a new generation of informal digital systems has emerged. The most prominent advantage of such systems is their ability to report on an outbreak in near real-time, or, in other words, before the information is officially reported, and by this to be used by public health decision makers for epidemiological assessment and preparation for the pandemic. Currently there is no evidence in the literature for their capability to detect an outbreak at its onset. In addition, there are no hard data to prove the benefits of using such systems before and during an outbreak. We do not believe that they can be used to identify early cases, but should be used as a support system for describing the spread of the disease. The challenge is to empirically assess the efficiency of informal digital systems and their use for decision making and interventions during crisis, as well as to test the systems' sensitivity and specificity. A more general informal system, which provides syndromic-based analysis of reports disseminated by all currently existing systems, may be the next step toward disease outbreak detection based on informal systems.",
