The authentic caring nurse leader recognizes that the leader/follower relationship is actualized when there are mutually shared personal values (1) .

Nurse leaders have a pivotal role in balancing the care of their staffs', with the care of the patients they serve.

Only one, the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, has internationally rivaled Covid-19. This is primarily due to the length of time it challenged the health care system. The Spanish Flu began in January of 1918 with victory only declared in December 1920. (2) During this time, schools, theatres, dance halls, churches, and businesses were shut down. Pictures from this historical event show nurses wearing masks as they care for patients.",

Here are some examples of each. A nurse leader may report misinformation to their staff unintentionally as they incorrectly interpret the CDC's latest recommendations. In an attempt to maintain a sense of control during chaos, the nurse leader may exhibit poor judgment in over-promising and under-delivering. Consider the leader who assures their staff of an abundance of PPE, only then to be told the latest shipment has not arrived. Finally, a decision made at a higher level places the nurse leader in a precarious position. The nurse leader may be chastised for expressing personal convictions at administrative team meetings. Actions contrary to those of the C-Suite may cause the nurse leader to be ostracized and powerless (8) . Any further attempts at advocating for staff and patients are futile. Despite the consequences of opposition, distrust, or faith, nurse leaders must continue to persevere and never lose sight of their morals and ethics. leaders that you have surrounded yourself with.
