            "text": "The majority of emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses. High rates of mutation, short generation times and large population sizes drive their rapid evolution. A wide variety of animals, including humans, are affected and examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, hepatitis A, B, and C virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and many others (Lai and Holmes, 2001). Understanding viral evolution is important because it can lead to outbreaks of known diseases (e.g. the 2009 human pandemic H1N1 influenza virus), host shifts and the emergence of new diseases (e.g. hantavirus), as well as escape from immune response and antiviral drugs (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus).",

Genetic diversity, defined as a measure of all the genotypes (genetic variation), as well as the frequency of those genotypes in the population, is created by mutations, including substitutions, deletions, and insertions, and recombination events that occur when the viral genome is replicated. Viral evolution is the result of a combination of high mutational input and the forces that act on the genetic diversity: selection both within and between hosts, which will increase the frequency of adaptive mutations and decrease the frequency of deleterious ones, and genetic drift during severe transmission bottlenecks, which will stochastically and indiscriminately affect the frequency of all types of mutation (Elena and Sanjuan, 2007, Manrubia and Lazaro, 2006). The processes involved in the emergence and spread of RNA viruses can often be measured in real time, making them perfect candidates for the study of the evolution of infectious diseases (Holmes, 2009).",

Their viral genome is approximately 27\u201331 Kb in length, which is the largest of the positive sense single stranded RNA viruses. Recently, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses reorganized the family Coronaviridae (http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/p/1230.aspx). The Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales, are now divided into two subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Coronavirinae are further subdivided into genus Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus based on genetic analysis of the conserved domains in the replicase protein pp1ab and on the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The alpha and betacoronaviruses infect and cause disease in mammals whereas the gammacoronaviruses are largely avian viruses.",

Extensive testing and quarantine of infected individuals contained the outbreak. Although there are currently no known cases of SARS, surveillance continues and rapid recognition and response plans have been put into place. The SARS-CoV emerged from a reservoir of coronaviruses in bats that transmitted to an intermediate host then to humans (Li et al., 2005). Thankfully it has not reemerged in humans.",

The causative agent, IBV, has also been found in peafowl (Galliformes) and IBV-like viruses have been isolated from teal (Anas crecca), geese (Anserinae), pigeons (Columbiformes), and ducks (Anseriformes) (Cavanagh, 2007). Clinical signs of the disease in chickens are watery eyes, mucus in the nares and trachea, gasping, coughing, and tracheal rales. The disease can also cause a decrease in egg production and egg quality, and some strains of the virus can cause an interstitial nephritis. When secondary pathogens like avian mycoplasmas, Escherichia coli, Ornithobacterium rhinotrachealie, and/or Bordetella avium complicate the disease, pneumonia, airsaculitis and peritonitis can occur. Morbidity is almost always 100% whereas mortality can be quite variable depending on the age of the birds, strain of the virus and secondary pathogens involved in the disease and can range from 14% to 82% (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). The virus replicates in epithelial cells causing lesions in the nasal turbinates, trachea, kidney, gonads, oviduct, lungs and airsacs. Lesions can also be found in the gastrointestinal tract, bursa of Fabricius and cecal tonsils.",

The Nsp 2 has been shown to play a role in facilitating de novo IBV protein synthesis by blocking protein kinase R (PKR) phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha), which shuts down protein synthesis. In addition, Nsp 2 induces expression of GADD34, a component of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which dephosphorylates eIF-2alpha (Wang et al., 2009). The Nsp 3 contains multiple domains including an acidic domain, an ADP-ribose 1 phosphatase, the papain-like protease (PLP), a Y domain and a transmembrane domain (Imbert et al., 2008, Neuman et al., 2008). The PLP of IBV and, interestingly, also SARS-CoV, is orthologous to PLP2 of other coronaviruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The PLP1 in IBV is truncated whereas in SARS-CoV it is missing altogether (Barretto et al., 2005, Ziebuhr et al., 2007). The PLP is responsible for cleaving between Nsps 2\u20133 and 3\u20134 and has been shown to contain deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities (Clementz et al., 2010, Frieman et al., 2009, Lindner et al., 2005). The Nsp 4 is a membrane spanning protein and along with Nsps 2 and 6 is thought to anchor the viral replication complex in double membrane vesicles at the golgi (Graham et al., 2008). Nonstructural protein 5 contains Mpro, a cysteine protease with a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Ziebuhr, 2006). The Mpro is responsible for cleaving Nsps 4 through 16. Nonstructural proteins 6 through 10 are membrane-localized proteins some of which have RNA binding activity and likely play a role in formation of the viral replication complex (Johnson et al., 2010, Kumar et al., 2007, Tangudu et al., 2007, Zhai et al., 2005, Ziebuhr, 2006). Nonstructural protein 11/12 is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), Nsp 13 contains the RNA helicase, Nsp 14 contains an exoribonuclease domain, Nsp 15 has an endoribonuclease domain, and Nsp 16 is a methyltransferase (Graham et al., 2008, Ivanov et al., 2004, Ziebuhr, 2005, Ziebuhr, 2006).",

The S glycoprotein is also involved in virus and cell membrane fusion and entry into the host cell, and it contains epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. Variability in the S1 gene is responsible for the multiple different genetic and antigenic types of the virus (see Fig. 1). The E protein is an integral membrane protein and the M protein is a membrane spanning protein. Both are involved with virus assembly.

The rate of other RNA viruses with smaller genomes can be as high as 1 \u00d7 10\u22121 substitutions/site/year. The difference is presumably due to the presence of a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain in Nsp 14, which contains similarities to host proteins involved in proofreading and repair (Minskaia et al., 2006, Snijder et al., 2003). Using an nsp 14-ExoN mutant SARS-CoV, Eckerle et al. (2010) showed impaired growth and a 21-fold increase in mutation rate for the mutant virus compared to wild type. That data and their previous work with a mouse hepatitis virus coronavirus (MHV\u2013CoV) ExoN mutant (Eckerle et al., 2007), confirms that ExoN, which is conserved in all coronaviruses, does contribute to the fidelity of the viral RdRp. High fidelity of the polymerase results in a higher \u201cerror threshold\u201d and likely permits the virus to maintain a large genome size (Holmes, 2009).",

The emergence of new variants and serotypes of IBV, whether the result of mutations or recombination, occurs continuously (Jackwood et al., 2005). Recombination directly leading to the emergence of a new avian coronavirus in turkeys (TCoV) was recently documented. The S gene of IBV recombined with an unknown virus, which altered its pathotype (respiratory to enteric) and host specificity (chicken to turkey), resulting in the emergence of TCoV (Jackwood et al., 2010). Data from that study showed that the full-length genomes of IBV and TCoV are greater than 86% similar whereas the spike glycoproteins are less than 36% similar with clear recombination break points at the 3\u2032 end of gene 1ab (nucleotide position 20,173) immediately upstream of the S gene and in the 3\u2032 end of the spike gene (nucleotide position 23,849) (Jackwood et al., 2010). It is likely that the unknown virus contributing S gene sequences in the emergence of TCoV is another avian coronavirus, since the only evidence of a gamma coronavirus recombining with either an alpha or beta coronavirus is the mosaic composition reported for the SARS-CoV (Zhang et al., 2004).",

Mutation rates for Mass and Conn IBV types, where live vaccines against those types are commonly used, were estimated to be 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 nucleotide changes/site/year, respectively (McKinley et al., 2011). Reisolation of vaccine viruses that are continuously introduced into the field and circulating in birds for a relatively short period of time likely contributed to the apparently low mutation rates.",

The average number of new infections caused by one infected individual (reproductive number, R), is a measure of the sustainability of a virus in the host population. For R\n < 1, the chain of transmission is not sustainable and the disease slowly dies out. For R\n > 1, the number of infected hosts increases, which in some cases can result in an epidemic. Eventually the pool of susceptible hosts is sufficiently depleted (or intervention measures are implemented) and R drops to below 1. The reproductive number for the situation where all hosts are susceptible (basic reproductive number, R\n0) is a measure of the transmissibility of a given pathogen. The R\n0 value for IBV has been estimated to be 19.95, which is extremely high (comparable to highly transmissible human diseases such as measles) and reflects the highly infectious nature of this virus (de Wit et al., 1998). Vaccination with a homologous antigenic type of the virus was found to reduce R\n0 to 0.69 indicating that proper and careful vaccination with a well-matched vaccine is an effective control strategy for IBV (de Wit et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Theoretically, transmission through a restrictive bottleneck followed by rapid expansion of the number of virus particles in the host can take a rare virus subpopulation and make it the predominant type, potentially leading to the emergence of a new genotype. Whether this is the mechanism behind the emergence of new types of IBV is not known because there exists little in vivo experimental data on bottlenecks and expansion of viruses transmitting and replicating in their natural animal host. There is a substantial body of experimental studies in the laboratory, especially using bacteriophages, that have addressed a variety of evolutionary factors including transmission bottlenecks and the dynamics of adaptation, (reviewed in (Elena and Sanjuan, 2007)). However, in vivo experiments in animal hosts have usually involved only two or a few individuals, which makes predicting viral evolution as a virus is transmitted through several hosts (i.e. over many transmission events) extremely difficult (Bouma et al., 2009, Coffey et al., 2008, Hoelzer et al., 2010, van der Goot et al., 2005). While studies are being performed to try to bridge the gap between the laboratory and nature, it is a challenging task. Consequently, there is a critical need for studies that utilize multiple-host chains of transmission similar to those used in vitro, but where host to host transmission events involve natural infections, in an experimental setting that allows for accurate measurements of viral evolution at critical time points. Understanding transmission and development of viral genetic diversity in a natural setting will hopefully elucidate the mechanisms behind the emergence of different genetic and antigenic types of IBV, allowing us to prevent, or at least to better predict the emergence of new coronavirus diseases. The rapid evolution of IBV makes this virus an excellent model to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.",

Currently, molecular typing tests that involve RT-PCR amplification of the S1 gene followed by nucleotide sequence analysis is being used to inexpensively determine the genetic type of a number of viruses in a short period of time. In addition, since the S1 gene of inactivated viruses can be amplified and sequenced, viruses can be imported (with the proper permits) from abroad. This along with an explosion of genetic data available in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) has allowed genetic comparison of IBV isolates from all over the world, significantly improving epidemiological data and attempts to control the disease (Callison et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Identification of the IBV type causing an outbreak in commercial poultry is necessary to be able to choose the appropriate vaccine(s) capable of inducing a protective immune response. Because only a few vaccine types, and in many countries only one vaccine (Mass type H120) can be used, variant viruses persist and outbreaks continue to occur (Gelb et al., 1991, Ignjatovic et al., 2006, Jackwood et al., 2005, Jackwood et al., 2009). Evolutionary rates for IBV are so rapid that even live attenuated vaccines undergo selection and mutation following only a single round of infection in the host. One study compared reisolated vaccine viruses with the original vaccine virus administered to the bird and found that selection of subpopulations as well as mutations were occurring in the S1 gene (McKinley et al., 2008). Another study found distinct virus subpopulations in the S1 gene were selected when chickens were vaccinated with the Ark-DPI strain of IBV (van Santen and Toro, 2008). Further analysis found that virus subpopulations were different in the microenvironment of distinct tissues of the host (Gallardo et al., 2010). These data indicate that different selection pressures leading to evolution of the virus during replication in the host can result in an even higher degree of virus diversity.",

Multiple infected hosts, high replication within hosts, and high mutation rates, lead to an extraordinarily diverse population of virus particles, which facilitates the evolution of the virus. Determining the size of bottlenecks during transmission, and the changes in virus genetic diversity during single and multiple infection cycles and how these affect transmission is important for evaluating the role of drift and selection on evolution, which is critical for the control of outbreaks of infectious bronchitis as well as other known coronaviral diseases. In addition, that knowledge is an important step in understanding the evolution of RNA viruses, which will make it possible to take a proactive approach to preventing the emergence of new coronaviral diseases.",
