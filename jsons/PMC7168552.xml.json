Phleboviruses are ubiquitous arthropod\u2010borne viruses (arboviruses), associated with human and animal disease, such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Punta Toro virus (PTV), Toscana virus (TOSV), Sandfly Naples virus (SFNV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) (Ayhan & Charrel, 2017; Gundacker et al., 2017; Hartman, 2017). The phleboviral genome consists of three single\u2010stranded RNA segments of negative or ambisense polarity, termed the large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments. The L segment encodes the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the M segment encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved into a non\u2010structural protein (NSm) and two envelope glycoproteins termed Gn and Gc. Finally, the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) transcribed in the viral sense and a non\u2010structural protein (NSs) transcribed in reverse sense (Hornak, Lanchy, & Lodmell, 2016).",

Serological studies suggest circulation of different arboviruses belonging to the Alphavirus, Flavivirus, Orthobunyavirus and Phlebovirus genera in different species from both extant sloth genera Bradypus and Choloepus in Central and South America (Gilmore, Da Costa, & Duarte, 2001; Medlin et al., 2016; Seymour, Peralta, & Montgomery, 1983a; de Thoisy, Dussart, & Kazanji, 2004; de Thoisy, Gardon, Salas, Morvan, & Kazanji, 2003). However, cross\u2010reactivity of antibodies between antigenically related arboviruses precludes definite assessments of the arboviruses infecting sloths. Viruses that have been genetically characterized from sloths include, among others, the orthobunyavirus Oropouche virus (OROV), the orbivirus Changuinola virus (CHV) and the two phleboviruses PTV and Anhanga virus (ANVH) (Seymour et al., 1983a; Seymour, Peralta, & Montgomery, 11983b;; Travassos da Rosa et al., 1984, 2017). For comparison, genomic sequences of coronaviruses alone mount to several hundreds to thousands in other mammalian orders such as bats, carnivores or ungulates, representing multiple viral species and genera (Drexler, Corman, & Drosten, 2014), thus highlighting the scarcity of viral genomic information available from sloth hosts.",

Recombination was assessed using the Recombination Detection Package V4 (Martin et al., 2010) and GARD (Kosakovsky Pond, Posada, Gravenor, Woelk, & Frost, 2006). Analyses of selection pressure were done using fixed\u2010effects likelihood (FEL) and single\u2010likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), both using the GTRxMG94 substitution model as done in Lam et al.

Since formal selection pressure analyses within ANHV\u2010related viruses are limited by the small data set, we selected the 10 genetically most closely related phleboviruses based on amino acid pairwise sequence distances within the complete L gene for these analyses (details on those viruses are provided in the figure legend). Chi\u2010square tests comparing the occurrence of non\u2010synonymous mutations between ANHV\u2010related virus genes and 95% confidence intervals were inferred using Prism version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, http://www.graphpad.com).",

Here, virus isolation was attempted from sloth serum diluted at 1:10 and 1:100 and inoculated onto Vero E6 maintained at 37\u00b0C and cultivated in DMEM, and C6/36 cells maintained at 28\u00b0C and cultivated in Leibovitz's L15 medium.

Infected cells were passaged three times every 7 days and controlled daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). In addition, a quantitative real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay was used to analyse potential isolation without CPE in supernatant from each passage (Table 1). After three passages, neither CPE nor an increment of RNA levels were observed, potentially due to degradation of the inoculum due to sampling in tropical conditions and repeated freeze\u2010thawing cycles.

Unfortunately, the exact time of entry of the wild animal into the sanctuary was not known, and whether the animal acquired phlebovirus infection in the wild or in the sanctuary remained unclear. The full coding sequence of the viral genome was recovered by deep sequencing. Comparison of the tree topology based on the four deduced proteins showed that the new sloth virus consistently clustered within the clade of mosquito/sandfly\u2010associated phleboviruses together with the ANHV prototype strain isolated in Brazil in 1962 (Nunes\u2010Neto et al., 2017) (Figure 1b). The four amino acid\u2010based ML trees displayed distinct clustering patterns; while in the L segment the two ANHV\u2010related strains were most related to Bujaru and Munguba viruses, the ANHV clade did not cluster in close relationship to other phleboviruses in trees based on the M, N and NSs segments (Figure 1b). No reassortment of the ANHV\u2010related viruses with other phleboviruses and no recombination events within ANHV\u2010related genes were detected.",

Considering that the recently proposed species demarcation criterion for phleboviruses is <95% amino acid identity within the translated L gene (Marklewitz, Palacios, Ebihara, Kuhn, & Junglen, 2019) and the 6.9% distance between the new ANHV\u2010related virus from Costa Rica and the Brazilian ANHV prototype strain in the translated L gene, these two viruses may correspond to two separate, yet monophyletic, species.

The envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc encoded by the M segment are associated with cellular attachment and viral entry and are targets for neutralizing antibodies (Venturi et al., 2007), and the NSs is associated with virulence and interferon antagonism in vertebrate cells (Billecocq et al., 2004). Therefore, the relatively higher divergence could be due to selective pressure associated with host adaptation and immune evasion during the genealogy of the two ANHV\u2010related viruses, that is the ANHV prototype strain and PEHV. However, mean dN/dS ratios ranged from 0.02 to 0.15 across all genes in a subset of phleboviruses genetically related to the ANHV\u2010related clade, irrespective of the method used (Figure 1d). Similarly, no sites showed significant evidence for positive selection. It should be noted that the apparent absence of positively selected sites might be biased by to insufficient number of sequences from individual viral species for robust formal selection pressure analyses. However, near\u2010complete absence of positively selected sites and similarly low mean dN/dS rates have been reported for larger phlebovirus data sets (Lam et al., 2013), suggesting robustness of our analyses. Significantly lower positive selection pressure in many arboviruses compared to other viruses is likely associated with their need to constantly adapt to both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts during their life cycle (Lequime, Fontaine, Ar Gouilh, Moltini\u2010Conclois, & Lambrechts, 2016; Sironi, Forni, Clerici, & Cagliani, 2016).",

Serological studies should ideally rely on both ANHV and PEHV isolates, since even the genetically closely related ANHV and PEHV may not cross\u2010react in serological assays, given the lack of cross\u2010reactivity between phleboviruses showing comparable genomic distances in their L and M genes (Marklewitz, Dutari, et al., 2019).",

Even if the infected animal was apparently healthy, viral infection can affect the host metabolism on the cellular level and potentially also on the level of the whole organism (Byers, Fleshman, Perera, & Molins, 2019; Gonzalez Plaza, Hulak, Kausova, Zhumadilov, & Akilzhanova, 2016). Whether acute viral infections in general and phlebovirus infections in particular may thus be harmful to sloths due to their metabolic constraints remains an intriguing question.",

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on translated amino acid sequences of the L, M, N and NSs genes with highlighted trees showing viruses closely related to ANHV and PEHV. Black circles at nodes represent support values of \u22650.75 from 1000 bootstrap replicates (b). Genome organization of the new PEHV found in Costa Rican sloths, showing genomic segments and encoded proteins (RdRp on L; NSm, Gn and Gc on M; nucleocapsid (N) and non\u2010structural (NSs) on S segment). Proteins were predicted according to BLASTp analysis comparing the PEHV genome with those from other pheboviruses. Red, non\u2010synonymous substitutions compared to ANHV reference sequences (c). Mean dN/dS (\u03c9) ratios on L, M, N and NSs genes using different methods as indicated below (d).
