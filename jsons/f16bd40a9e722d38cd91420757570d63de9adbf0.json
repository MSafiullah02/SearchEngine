Many of the models formulate stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity, which are of great interest recently. The spatial heterogeneity ranges from the uneven probabilities of contacts between the individuals in communities [Walker 2010] , [Small 2006 ], dependence of the strength of the demographical interactions between cities on the distance [Keeling 2004] , to nation-wide or worldwide inhomogeneous geographical structures [Dangerfield 2009 ], [Riley 2007] .",

            "text": "A Monte-Carlo stochastic simulation is widely used to understand the influence of the spatial heterogeneity on stochastic spreading. In such a simulation, accuracy and reproducibility of the input demographical knowledge such as the amount of traffic between cities have great impacts on the reliability of the output pattern of the movement of pathogens and their hosts. But, in studying world-wide epidemics, just a collection of regular airline routes and aircraft capacities does not always present the transportation network which results in the real chain of transmission. Some routes are influential decisively, but the others are not. Examples are found in the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) from Asia to the world in 2003. There were not any cases in Japan in spite of the heavy traffic there from Asian countries. Many patients appeared in Canada earlier than the United States to which airlines connect Asian countries much more densely. Here arises an interesting question. Inversely, is it possible to learn the effectively decisive transportation network by observing how the disease spreads, reinforce the demographical knowledge on the network, and import the acquired knowledge into the mathematical model? This is an inverse problem similar to the network tomography [Maeno 2009 ], [Rabbat 2008] .",

It is often confirmed empirically that a simple law relates a network topology to the movement [Barrat 2004 ]. The topology is specified by a neighbor matrix l. The transportation between two regions is represented by a pair of unidirectional links. If a pair of links is present between n i and n j , l ij = l ji = 1. If absent, l ij = l ji = 0. By definition, l ii = 0.

The state of a person changes from a susceptible state (S), through an infectious state (I), to a recovered state (R). In contrast, the immunity does not occur in the SIS compartment model. The state of a recovered patient goes back to S. The parameter \u03b1 represents the probability at which an infectious person contacts a person and infect the person per a unit time. If the contacted person is susceptible, the number of the infectious persons increases by 1. The effective rate of infection by a single infectious person is the product of \u03b1 and the proportion of the susceptible persons within the population. The parameter \u03b2 represents the probability at which an infectious person recovers per a unit time. These parameters are constants over subpopulations and time.

Links are present except for the one between n 5 and n 9 . The drawing [C] shows the topology estimated from the dataset. The error is E l = 0.18. The core is discovered correctly. The ability of the method is surprising in distinguishing the only pair of nodes where the link is absent. The links from the core to n 1 and n 7 are discovered. Although the method identifies that n 3 , n 6 , and n 8 do not belong to the core, but form the stubs (dead ends) from the core, it fails to estimate how they are connected to each other and the core. The number of cases is the smallest at these nodes. The movements of infectious persons to and from them are so infrequent that the analysis on them is not so reliable.",

For small k i , the naive estimation does not work at all. As k i increases, E l of the method increases and that of the naive estimation decreases. For large k i , the naive estimation becomes less erroneous than the random guess. But, it never surpasses the method in this study. The initially heterogeneous node-to-node distribution of infectious persons relaxes more quickly in the networks having more links. For example, the standard deviation of I i (t 99 ) is about 400 for k i = 2, and about 300 for k i = 4, while the mean for both k i is about 550 (\u2248 I 0 (0) exp((\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)D\u2206t)/N ). The growing trends also become more homogeneous. Under such homogeneity, the negative correlation implies the movements between nodes directly.
