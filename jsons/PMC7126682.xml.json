This issue manifests itself at different scales and plays a role in private companies and public authorities as well as academia. For example, individual scientists and research departments have a keen interest in spending their time and money in areas with potential for high impact (Kajikawa et al., 2008, Kostoff, 2008, Kostoff and Schaller, 2001, Leydesdorff et al., 1994, Ogawa and Kajikawa, 2015). Likewise, (inter)national governmental institutions seek to establish policy instruments (e.g. legislation and funding schemes) that give priority to development and application of innovative solutions with the highest positive contribution for society (Coccia, 2009, Kidwell, 2013).",

Making well-informed decisions requires detailed knowledge of past findings and current trends, and a deep understanding of emerging technology pathways (Leydesdorff et al., 1994, Yoon and Park, 2005). At the same time, it asks for a broad perspective to oversee future needs while identifying the opportunities that arise in neighboring research domains. The context in which such decisions are made is becoming increasingly complex because traditional science and engineering domains are getting more and more interconnected (Morillo et al., 2003, Porter and Rafols, 2009). In addition, the information that is documented in patents, reports and research papers continues to grow in size at an exponential rate (Kajikawa et al., 2008, Kostoff and Schaller, 2001, Larsen and Von Ins, 2010, Bengisu and Nekhili, 2006). The availability of input for research and technology planning can therefore be perceived as overwhelming, especially for decision-makers who are new to the field. The inability to properly analyze and comprehend all this information may lead to wrong recommendations and suboptimal priorities in research and development agendas.",

It has successfully been implemented in different fields, such as economy (Nassirtoussi et al., 2014), environmental science (Dubari\u0107 et al., 2011, Iniyan and Sumathy, 2003), foresight (Saritas and Burmaoglu, 2015, Su and Lee, 2010), health science (Pereira and Escuder, 1999, Abbott et al., 2014), politics (Coates, 1985), nano science and technology (Huang et al., 2011, de Miranda Santo et al., 2006, Robinson et al., 2007), and social science (Baloglu and Assante, 1999, Singh et al., 2007). The literature on science foresight covers a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative means for monitoring clues and indicators of evolving trends and developments (Coates, 1985). To facilitate successful science foresight analyses, it is clear that the methodology needs to be matched with e.g., the purpose of the study, the size and quality of the database, and the type of output that is expected. However, the available information about the relative effectiveness of different science foresight methods is very limited, and it is therefore difficult to support such decisions. In addition, most methods perform well at some, but typically not all aspects of science foresight. The potential of combining the positive sides of different science foresight methods into one overall framework has so far remained relatively unexplored.",

Although we aim at wider applicability, in this paper, the framework is developed and demonstrated with respect to wind catchers; a sustainable natural ventilation system for buildings. This topic was specifically chosen because it is manageable in scope and size (i.e. the veracity of the results can be checked), yet has experienced a complex development history, is an active field with mixed research methods, and has a non-trivial future outlook. This paper uses a combination of existing methods: life-cycle analysis, text mining and cluster analysis, but combines them in a novel way that has not been described before. Given the importance of the impact of textual data on the accuracy of text mining, a sensitivity analysis is also carried out for three cases, when (i) title, (ii) title, abstract and keywords, and (iii) full-text of the papers are considered as the textual data. This evaluation is based on the methodology of the research papers.",

Ernst (Ernst, 1997) suggests that the accumulation of patent applications is useful for measuring technology trends. The evolution over time can be plotted as S-shape curve to represent its technology life-cycle. There are four stages in a technology life cycle: introduction, growth, maturity and saturation (Ernst, 1997). During the introduction stage, there is a little growth in the number of patent applications. The growth stage, on the other hand, is characterized by exponential growth. As the patent application rate declines, the maturity stage is entered. The saturation stage indicates limited growth with only few additional patent applications (Trappey et al., 2011a).",

Once the papers have been segmented into a sequence of tokens, the next step is to convert each of the tokens to a standard form. In English, as in many other languages, words occur in text in more than one form. Often, but not always, it is advantageous to eliminate this kind of variation before further processing. When the normalization is confined to regularizing grammatical variants such as singular/plural and present/past, the process is called stemming (Weiss et al., 2010).

In order to find the knowledge gaps efficiently, experts' opinion is needed to consider all aspects of a scientific field, even those that are not explicitly mentioned in research papers. An ontology tree, or hierarchy, can help the experts specify a general overview of a scientific field. This hierarchy specifies the relationships between concepts and is used to extract meaningful words and phrases from the papers. Since generating a hierarchy is domain specific, experts must select the keywords and phrases related to this technology. In this study, the hierarchy is generated based on experts' opinion. Using the keywords that were automatically extracted from the papers, experts were able to generate this hierarchy easier. Note that the experts are allowed to add, remove and replace keywords during this step. To make the technology hierarchy, the method presented by Yoon and Park (Yoon and Park, 2005) is used. They used this method to generate a technology tree and transform it into a morphology box. This method helps to break a complex problem or technology into several parts (dimensions), so that it can be analyzed more easily.

The function normalized TF-IDF or NTF approach is expressed by Eq.

In the present study, however, the research methodology of each paper is used as the clustering variables. Using this method, the correlation of each research methodology with dictionary keywords can be determined, which is important to support effective research planning. Further information will be given in Section 4.3. In addition, the knowledge gaps can also be identified, by analyzing cases where there is no high co-occurrence or correlation between the research methodology and dictionary keywords. In the interpretation of the knowledge gaps, it is particularly interesting to link these findings back to the evolution of research methodologies, as identified through the combination of text mining and life cycle analysis. Therefore, after normalizing the frequency of the keywords, the correlation between these keywords and the keywords related to the methodology of the papers, are measured with the Pearson correlation coefficient as shown in Table 3\n. Note that the keywords related to each methodology are determined by the experts. For each methodology, the total frequency of all related keywords is used as an input for the correlation measurement. This measurement is based on the keywords' co-occurrence with the methodology keywords in each paper. In Table 3 KP represents the keywords or key phrases and Ri,j is the correlation between keyword i, and the group of keywords related to methodology j.",

K-means is a common clustering algorithm that has been used in a wide variety of applications to partition a data set into K groups (de Miranda Santo et al., 2006, Chemchem and Drias, 2015). To do so, the user must assign a number K as the expected number of clusters. Since the centroids of clusters are randomly chosen, the algorithm must repeat many times to adjust centroids and can only achieve locally optimal clustering results. The optimal number of clusters is defined by the experts after analyzing the result of clustering with different numbers. So choosing the best clusters is an expert-based procedure. In addition, to verify the authenticity of the experts' opinion, the Davies-Bouldin index (Bezdek and Pal, 1998) is used.",

Research and development of innovative building systems is expected to play an important role in facilitating this transition towards sustainable building design (Loonen et al., 2014). Natural ventilation strategies have the potential to become a viable alternative for energy-intensive air-conditioning systems, but new approaches are needed to lead to wider adoption. Inspiration for new concepts can be found by looking at traditional design strategies such as the \u201cwind catcher\u201d, which was used to provide natural ventilation and passive cooling in hot and arid regions of Iran and neighboring countries (Saadatian et al., 2012). The cooling performance of both ancient and modern wind catchers has been analyzed and optimized by several researchers, using experimental, computational or analytical methods (Saadatian et al., 2012, Montazeri and Azizian, 2009, Montazeri, 2011, Montazeri and Azizian, 2008, Montazeri et al., 2010, Bahadori et al., 2008, Soutullo et al., 2011, Hassan and Lee, 2014, Su et al., 2008, Calautit et al., 2013, Calautit et al., 2014). In addition to academic contexts, industry has also paid attention to the development of these systems. These technology transfer activities have led to the invention of multiple new commercial wind catcher systems that meet the requirements of modern-day building design (Hughes et al., 2012). However, considering the relatively slow uptake in practice, it can be argued that further research and development is still needed to fully utilize the potential of wind catchers.",

The time in which the value is between 10\u2212 1 and 101 is equal to \u0394t, and the time at 100 is the point of inflection (t\nm). The publications follow a bi-logistic curve (Fig. 3(b)). The first curve started in 1984 and its growth phase began in 1990. Then, after a relatively short growth and maturation phase, it reached its saturation level in 1997. Around the year 2000, another logistic started. This pause in publications and the renewed interest after the year 2000 can be explained by the increasing application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a method for investigating the performance of wind catchers. This can be clearly observed in Fig. 4\nin which the actual number of papers per methodology that were published in a given period is presented. Moreover, the pattern presented in Fig. 3(b) marks the transition from analysis of ancient wind catchers towards the development of innovative wind catcher systems in the 21st century. The second curve has currently entered the growth stage of the publications life-cycle. It has had a continuing growth since 2006. Using the growth model described in Section 2.1, the publication count is forecasted to increase by about 54% and reach its upper limit at 2020 with 142 papers. Therefore, this extrapolation indicates a clear potential for the development of this field in science and technology. Note that the growth period can still be extended, if there are new breakthrough innovations in this area. Therefore, scientists and inventors should analyze potential opportunities in this field.",

The nine clusters including all keywords are presented in Table 6\n. Note that the number of clusters greatly depends on the number of clustering variables. The total number of clusters reflects how the keywords in the dictionary keywords have been investigated from a methodological point of view. Depending on the strength of co-occurrence and correlation between keywords and research methodologies, different scenarios can be distinguished. These scenarios are therefore an aggregation of possible cases. Given the clustering results, four possible scenarios can be considered for research on a specific keyword:a)There is a high correlation between the keyword and a single research methodology. This scenario indicates that only one research methodology has been used to investigate the keyword. In this study, the total number of possible clusters for this scenario is 4 clusters (WT, FS, CFD, and BPS, AFN & AN). In total, 26 out of 57 keywords in the dictionary keywords have been investigated using only one methodology.b)There is a high correlation between the keyword and multiple research methodologies. In this case, the keyword has been investigated using a combination of two or more research methodologies, in which the keyword has a high correlation with all those research methodologies, and no correlation with others. In this study, the total number of possible clusters for this scenario is 11 (WT + FS, WT + CFD, WT + BPS, AFN & AN, etc.). Clusters 5, 6 and 8 have been identified in this category. The results show that 20 keywords have been investigated using two or three research methodologies.c)There is a low correlation between the keyword and one methodology but high correlation with multiple research methodologies. Cluster 7 represents this scenario. It comprises keywords that have been investigated using two or more research methodologies (three in this case), in which the correlation between the keywords and at least one of the research methodologies is significantly lower than the other methodologies in the cluster, but not zero. Out of many possible combinations, only one such cluster was identified in this study. Such a moderate correlation indicates that a trend is certainly discernible, but that the correlation is less pronounced than is the case for the two previous scenarios. In the present case, it is interesting to observe that keywords in cluster 6 (belonging to the second scenario) can all be characterized as \u2018structural\u2019, following the classification introduced in Section 2.2.2.2.2. Keywords in cluster 7 are connected to the same research methodologies as cluster 6, but can be connected to either \u2018procedure\u2019 or \u2018application\u2019.d)The correlation between the keyword and the four research methodologies is zero. It indicates that no significant research on this combination has taken place yet. Keywords in cluster 9 belong to this scenario.\n",

Keywords in Scenario 2, on the other hand, relate to phenomena or aspects that have already been investigated in a multi-disciplinary approach. The third scenario can provide additional information to the second scenario. Given the relatively low correlation of the keywords and one of the research methodologies, this information should be treated with caution, preferably in combination with expert's opinion.

The absence or presence of co-occurrence and correlation can play a role in multiple ways, for example:a.There is one cluster including keywords that have no high co-occurrence and correlation with any of the research methodologies (Cluster 9), i.e. these keywords have not yet been investigated using any of the research methodologies. As all relevant research methodologies have been taken into account in clustering, these keywords and phrases can be assessed by the experts to find new fields in wind catcher studies and therefore, it can be used as a guide for researchers to decide about research directions to fill knowledge gaps, find innovative design solutions, and prolong the growth level in the publication life-cycle in this field. Some of the knowledge gaps in wind catcher studies are identified as follows:\n\u2022The phrase \u201cwind comfort\u201d in Cluster 9 indicates that issues related to wind discomfort have not yet been considered in wind catcher studies.\u2022Knowledge of convective heat transfer in building spaces is required to improve occupant thermal comfort and indoor air quality.

Using inappropriate models to calculate CHTC can lead to considerable errors in Building Energy Simulation (BES).\u2022The potential of integrating (small) \u201cwind turbines\u201d in wind catchers has not yet been investigated.

In this study, clusters with co-occurrence or correlation with the research methodology and dictionary keywords (Clusters 1 to 8) can be useful for researchers to identify how different research methodologies have been used. This can therefore result in choosing more appropriate research methodologies for a specific application. For example, research on the impact of evaporative cooling in enhancing the cooling performance of wind catchers has been performed using full-scale measurements. Given the advantages of CFD, the results of the current study suggests the possibility of using CFD as a powerful tool for the investigation of water spray systems in wind catchers. It is expected that the results by CFD will lead to new insights and information that could not have been obtained with full-scale measurements.c.In some occasions, different research methodologies are used in a complementary way. For example, Clusters 1 and 2 provide useful information on whether experimental data (e.g. full-scale or wind tunnel) is available in the literature for validating the mathematical models developed for a specific application.
