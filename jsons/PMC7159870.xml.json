Specific cancer treatments might also differentially contribute to risk of COVID-19. Severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with cytokine storm and increased concentrations of C-reactive protein and IL-6 pneumonitis, severe adverse events that are also associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.8 Consequently, patients on immunotherapy could be at increased risk from COVID-19. Furthermore, cytotoxic treatments used for haematological malignancies diminish lymphocyte populations, potentially rendering patients more susceptible to infection. Conversely, many cancer treatments for solid tumours have little effect on lymphocyte populations or inflammatory responses. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly unlikely to affect all patients with cancer equally.",

Policies, including self-isolation and social distancing, are widely acknowledged to be required to suppress viral spread, both in the general and at-risk populations, thereby reducing pressure on already stretched health-care resources. However, substantial reallocation of resources away from cancer care services could potentially have unintended cancer-related implications, including increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, real-time collection, analysis, and dissemination of data from our cancer centres about SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in patients with cancer, and their disease outcomes, is needed.",

The project will collect data on patients with cancer who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including tumour type and stage, patient age, present cancer treatment, and clinical outcomes, with the aim to enable oncologists to gain crucial insights to inform decision making. Data collection, analysis, and dissemination is coordinated by the Centre for Computational Biology at the University of Birmingham, (Birmingham, UK) through a dedicated workflow hosted by the Compute and Storage for Life Science infrastructure as part of the Birmingham Environment for Academic Research local Cloud.10\n",
