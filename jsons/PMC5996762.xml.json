This criterion does not consider the multiplicity of pathophysiologic derangements and heterogeneous histopathologic conditions that lead to airway obstruction. Both decrease in elastic recoil and decrease in cross-sectional airway diameter (independent of [and frequently concomitant with] each other) will lead to an increase in airway resistance during expiration, leading to airflow limitation.8 This ramification increases further if one considers the multiple molecular derangements that lead to loss of elastic recoil and airway damage. This definition also leaves a large proportion of subjects with physiologic abnormalities, respiratory symptoms, or both that do not reach COPD diagnostic criteria. For example, use of 0.7 as a cut point for FEV1/FVC ratio excludes a significant portion of subjects (many of them with ratios of less than the predictive lower limit of normal values) that have significant symptoms.9 In addition, the lower limit of normal for FEV1/FVC ratio decreases with age. Thus the accuracy of these diagnostic criteria also changes with age, affecting the establishment of early diagnosis in this disease among younger patients.10\n",

Overall, these smoke-related lung diseases are very common, with significant morbidity and possible risk for progression to COPD, as defined by using spirometric criteria. For example, in the COPDGene cohort, smokers without spirometric criteria for COPD have worse health status when assessed by using the St George Respiratory Questionnaire.17 In the SPIROMICS cohort, respiratory symptoms are present in half of smokers with preserved pulmonary function; when compared with asymptomatic smokers, these symptomatic subjects had greater limitation of physical activity, impaired pulmonary function (although still within the limits considered as normal), and evidence of airway wall thickening on CT imaging of the chest.9 Importantly, smokers with preserved lung function and respiratory symptoms had higher rates of exacerbations than asymptomatic smokers (COPD Assessment Test [CAT] score <10).",

In smokers with asthma, there are fewer eosinophils, increased numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and goblet cell hyperplasia.19, 20 Of note, there are no clear treatment guidelines for this group of symptomatic smokers who have no spirometric criteria for COPD. However, a large proportion (between 20% and 42%) receive respiratory treatment with inhaled medications,9, 17 despite data that smokers with asthma might be poorly responsive to corticosteroid therapy.21 The above considerations indicate that more research is needed to define the phenotypic changes and pathophysiologic derangements of smoke-related lung disease before meeting the spirometric definition for COPD.",

The 2-mm cutoff used to define small airways is based on experiments using retrograde catheters inserted into open lungs of dogs performed by Macklem and Mead11 more than 50 years ago. As such, the physiologic abnormalities occur in a large silent region, and spirometric abnormalities become significant only later in disease development. Direct measurement of the distribution of resistance in the lower respiratory tract has confirmed that the small airways (ie, <2 mm in internal diameter) are the major sites in which obstruction starts in patients with emphysema.24, 25 Micro-CT of surgical specimens from patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I COPD further demonstrated airway narrowing and loss of the small conducting airways.23 Therefore it is not surprising that respiratory symptoms and structural changes in the lung are frequently discordant with spirometric results.",

Moreover, additional data have strongly suggested that functional small-airways abnormalities identified by using this technique are associated with rate of FEV1 decrease.28 In addition, CT can provide a measure of airway count, a parameter shown recently to be an earlier marker of COPD and associated independently with rapid lung function decrease.29 Expiratory central airway collapse can be identified by bronchoscopic visualization or expiratory CT and has been suggested to be associated with significant respiratory morbidity.30, 31, 32\n",

Resistance reflects predominately the frictional forces related to airflow within the airways. Reactance reflects the elastic properties and inhomogeneities of ventilation across the respiratory system. Higher oscillation frequencies (approximately 20 Hz) reflect large airways, and lower oscillation frequencies (<10 Hz) reflect properties of the entire respiratory system, including the small airways. Thus in the presence of normal forced airflows (as noted by normal FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio), abnormalities present in low oscillation frequencies can be attributed to small-airway dysfunction.",

Data demonstrated the presence of small-airways dysfunction despite normal airflow on spirometry.36, 37 The clinical relevance of the small-airway dysfunction was demonstrated in multiple domains.

Although distinguishing these phenotypes might be of interest, the relative contribution of airway heterogeneity versus parenchymal destruction is not readily quantifiable, and both mechanisms coexist frequently in an individual patient.

            "text": "Multiple different phenotypes of emphysema have been described, including centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal phenotypes. Some differences can be noted among these phenotypes. For example, the centrilobular phenotype is associated with greater smoking history, whereas the panlobular phenotype is associated with reduced body mass index independently from FEV1.65 Paraseptal emphysema seems to be associated with fewer symptoms and less physiologic impairment. However, it is still not clear what determines the distribution of the emphysema. Careful phenotyping of the anatomic distribution also has important therapeutic implications. This is shown by the survival benefit for lung volume reduction surgery among patients with upper lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity.66 Similarly, a significant clinical effect can be achieved by means of regional reduction by endobronchial valves based on identification of affected lobes without collateral ventilation.67\n",

Prior data suggested this phenotype was associated with a more rapid decrease in lung function and exacerbations.68, 69 However, analysis of the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE) data showed that this phenotype was not independently associated with exacerbations in multivariate analysis.70 The airway inflammation present in patients with this phenotype is characterized by increased neutrophil, macrophage, and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocyte counts.71 Colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms leads to further neutrophilic response.72 In addition, patients with COPD frequently have microaspiration associated with gastroesophageal reflux caused by lack of coordination between breathing and swallowing.73, 74, 75 Smoking impairs mucociliary clearance and reduces the ability to clear oral microbes from the lower airways, exacerbating inflammation.76 This leads to chronic cough with progressive incoordination of breathing with swallowing. Therefore it is not surprising that newer culture-independent techniques used to characterize the lower airway microbiota demonstrate the presence of upper airway commensals such as Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella species.77\n",

In asthmatic patients irreversible airway obstruction with airway remodeling occurs as disease progresses, whereas in patients with COPD, bronchodilator response to \u03b22-agonist occurs in approximately 45% of patients with COPD117 and might be less common with an emphysema-dominant phenotype.118 Genetic variation of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor might explain why some patients with COPD have better response to this type of drug.119\n",

It is possible that the presence of high eosinophil counts represents a biomarker of a distinct host endotype with predominance of a TH2 phenotype and thus more responsive to corticosteroids.132 However, eosinophil counts vary across compartments.

Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD Exacerbations (FLAME) trial, the therapeutic response to a combination of a second-generation long-acting \u03b2-agonist (indacaterol) and long-acting muscarinic agonist (glycopyrronium) was similar to that to a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting \u03b2-agonist (fluticasone/salmeterol), even in the predefined group of subjects with high blood eosinophil counts. Mepolizumab, an anti\u2013IL-5 agent that affects proliferation, differentiation, and migration of eosinophils, was evaluated recently in patients with COPD, showing no significant differences in the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations.136 However, in a subgroup of patients with defined blood eosinophil counts (\u2265150 cells/mm3 at screening or \u2265300/mm3 during the previous year), a dose of 100 mg of mepolizumab (but not 300 mg) was associated with a small but statistically significant lower annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Whether eosinophil levels alone are sufficient as biomarkers to identify a treatable distinct trait of COPD requires further longitudinal investigation.137\n",

It is possible that COPD represents more of a syndrome rather than a defined disease entity, and we are at a point of redefining what this means. By enclosing different entities under the umbrella of COPD, we are committing our pathophysiologic investigations and therapeutic discoveries to fail because of multiple confounders. This is now increasingly accepted in asthmatic patients, in whom relabeling asthma and identification of treatable traits is at the forefront of current investigations.143, 144, 145 In patients with COPD, it is clear that novel endotyping approaches combined with small-airways physiologic evaluation and imaging are needed to define these different subpopulations of COPD. In addition, multidimensional system-based approaches that integrate symptoms, pulmonary function (beyond FEV1), imaging, microbiology, and immunology profiling should provide a holistic view of this heterogeneous disease.",
