For asymptomatic athletes\nwho are isolated due to recent travel or close contact with an individual with\nCOVID-19, maintaining cardiovascular fitness may be difficult. Exercise that is\nrecommended during the in-home isolation period is dependent on the available\nequipment, which may include a stationary bike, treadmill, and resistance training.\nGuidance and monitoring by a strength and conditioning coach or exercise\nphysiologist can be provided remotely.",

Sports medicine providers should know\nthe most common symptoms of COVID-19, work within their environments to learn and\ndevelop testing protocols as indicated by local resources, and minimize spread among\nteams. Treatment in the outpatient setting is mainly supportive and includes home\nisolation, although several treatment drugs are under clinical investigation.",
