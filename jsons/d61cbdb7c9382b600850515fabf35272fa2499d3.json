These findings extend recent Australian government data showing a higher than normal prevalence of stress, anxiety and hopelessness among the general community during the COVID-19 pandemic (2) A greater proportion of people experiencing job loss reported severe psychological distress than those still employed. This difference was statically significant in a baseline model adjusting for age, gender and social interaction, but non-significant when other confounders were included in an adjusted model. This finding suggests that the pathway from job loss to psychological distress may be mediated by financial stress and occupation. In contrast the effect of social interactions remained robust and statistically significant in both baseline and adjusted models. People reporting greater social interaction were less likely to report psychological distress. Maintaining or enhancing social interactions may be a strategy that can support positive psychological outcomes in people experiencing employment shocks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Each 1-point increase in the DSSI score was associated with 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69-0.85) reduction in the odds of psychological distress. Participants who had lost their job had greater odds of reporting psychological distress [OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.05 -2.06].Women and those aged under 35 years also had greater odds of distress in this model.ConfoundersFinancial stress and occupation confounded the interaction between outcome and exposure variables and were included in the adjusted model. A range of other variables were tested but did not alter this interaction including: being the primary earner in the household, employment type prior to changes (full-time/part-time/casual), whether an application for social assistance had been filed, self-assessed health, highest education level, job tenure, job satisfaction, days of notice before change in job status, industry, and household structure.Adjusted ModelThe addition of the two confounders altered the estimated effect of the exposure variables on psychological distress. The effect on the DSSI score was minimal, with the estimated odds ratio for a 1-point increase in the DSSI score changing to 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.88). There was a larger attenuation on the effect of work status and this effect was no longer significant (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.81). As in the baseline model, females and younger workers had greater odds of psychological distress. Those in financial stress had elevated odds of psychological distress (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.38, 2.70). Managers were the occupation with the largest odds of experiencing psychological distress, with both professionals and sales workers having approximately only half the odds of distress.",
