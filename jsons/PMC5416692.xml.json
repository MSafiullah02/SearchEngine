In 2012, the rate of suicide among those serving in the United States uniformed services surpassed that of combat deaths in war zones.3, 4 Clearly, suicide prevention efforts demand increased attention.

            "text": "Even though suicidal behavior is the ultimate negative psychiatric outcome, the study of suicide can be difficult and experimental procedures among vulnerable populations can be ethically challenging. Although research at these levels of understanding is needed, current suicide rates suggest that additional approaches should also be strongly considered. Despite conceptual attempts to draw parallels between self-killing behavior in nonhuman animals and suicidal behavior in humans, our position is that suicide as it exists in humans is the outcome of a unique cognitive process. It involves insight, planning, and intent that is unlikely to be present in nonhuman animals, and in particular rodent model systems that are a focus of this review.20, 21, 22 Although we do not eliminate the possibility that nonhuman animals may engage in self-killing acts, such behavior is not the focus of this review. We argue that the increased use of animal model approaches with translational validity to study suicide neurobiology would allow the testing of hypotheses, as well as novel drug discovery leading to improved treatments for the prevention of suicide. Hypotheses tested first in animals and then in humans could point toward new treatments allowing a faster and more precise identification of potential molecular pathways and treatment targets, the avoidance of obstacles in human studies of suicide-related ethical concerns, as well as the issues with obtaining adequate sample sizes. Conversely, confirmation in animals of epidemiological and clinical observations in humans with suicidal behavior sublimated to simpler endophenotypes in thoroughly controlled experiments increases our capability to move associations closer toward causation, often unattainable in humans considering the degree of potential confounding, uncertain direction of causality, and interactions of multiple intertwined contributory factors. The authors on this review include both clinical and preclinical researchers, who have a shared interest in advancing the use of preclinical animal model approaches for the study of suicidal behavior.",

Although there are obvious limitations in assessing suicidal intent in animals, such as reproducing conceptualization, motivation, conscious planning, and the ultimate action of killing oneself,22 many components implicated in the neurobiology of suicidal behaviors, and the neurobiology of circuits delineated as relevant to ideation in humans, may be studied in animal models. Indeed, most animal \u2018models' are only intended to recapitulate some aspects of human diseases, or components of neurobiology implicated in human psychiatric disorders, rather than the disorder itself. This approach limits \u2018anthropomorphizing' by keeping the focus on neurobiological and pharmacological quantitative aspects that can be translated from humans to animal studies, which commonly use rodents. For example, in animal models of other uniquely human psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia or depression, experimental animals cannot be labeled as psychotic or depressed. However, approaches that involve the use of model systems are still invaluable in understanding distinct component processes relevant to the disorder, are extensively used in the development of treatment approaches, and are applied toward identifying genetic and environmental influences for such conditions.23",

            "text": "A critically important aspect of developing an animal model approach to the study of suicidal behavior is to be realistic regarding what a particular model is measuring. The credibility of specific animal models as they pertain to human mental conditions are commonly evaluated as to whether they demonstrate face, construct, and predictive validity.24, 25 Face validity refers to phenotypes that contain similarities to humans who have the condition. Construct validity refers to processes that result in human pathology and are recapitulated with the model. Predictive validity relates to the capacity of a model to make predictions about the human condition. A model with predictive validity is sensitive to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that effectively modify the condition in humans. We do not propose the development of animal models of suicidal behavior with face validity. However, predictive- or construct-based approaches can be formulated in the study of suicidal behavior, generally using suicide risk factors, and specifically candidate endophenotypes (quantifiable measures of neurobiological function) associated with suicide. Using this strategy, it becomes possible to translate clinical findings related to complex human behavior to animals and vice versa (Figure 1).26 We note that it is humans, not nonhuman animals, who manifest suicidal behavior. Basic studies in model animals can be used to understand fundamental mechanisms that underlie biological phenomena, but the biology underlying pathological dysregulation requires validation in humans.27",

Animal models also present opportunities to study interactions between development and environment on critical neuronal circuits using manipulations not possible in humans. It is logistically and ethically more acceptable to investigate animal models than to perform human experimentation. For instance, moderators and modulators that have been associated with suicidal behavior can be investigated in relationship to endophenotypes in animal models without the risk to human life. Here, we briefly review some of these human biological findings. What is presented is not meant to be all inclusive, but rather to provide salient examples of approaches using rodent models that can be used to advance research designed to improve our understanding of the neurobiology and treatment of suicidal behavior.",

Of course, early familial exposure to psychopathology and a suicidal attempt can have a detrimental effect on the family members, especially on those in a stage of emotional cognitive development such as young children and adolescents, and such effect would be unrelated to the genetic component. Addressing this issue, twin studies strongly suggested genetic contributions to liability for suicidal behavior with a heritability between 45 and 55%.38 Concordance for suicidal behavior was significantly more frequent among monozygotic (24.1%) than dizygotic twin pairs (2.3%). However, we cannot entirely discount that monozygotic twins experience an intricate unique psychological and emotional symbiosis throughout life, resulting in an increased potential of contagion of suicidal behavior that is not present in dizygotic twins. Adoption studies have also supported the role of genetic risks.39, 40, 41 For instance, suicide and indicators of severe psychiatric disorders in the biological parents were found to be similarly related to suicide in non-adopted and adopted children.42",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs, have recently gained prominent attention for their role in neural plasticity and higher brain functioning.76, 77, 78, 79 These miRNAs bind to short sequences located predominantly within the 3\u2032-untranslated region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and interfere with translation or stability of mRNAs with the potential to modulate disease phenotypes.80 Several miRNAs have been shown to regulate genes that are crucial in the neurobiology of suicidal behavior. For example, early childhood stress is significantly associated with upregulation of miR-16 and subsequent downregulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene in hippocampus.81 A strong miRNA-target interaction between miR-135 and the sodium-dependent serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) transporter and 5-HT receptor-1A transcripts has also been reported.82 Intriguingly, miR-135a levels are upregulated after the administration of antidepressants.82 Moreover, a decrease in 5-HT1A receptors was observed in postmortem brain samples from depressed suicides compared with healthy controls.83 Interestingly, Jensen et al.84 reported that the expression of 5-HT1B receptors, involved in aggressive behavior in humans, a critical endophenotype of suicide, is repressed by miR-96, which depends on the A-element of the 5-HT1B receptor mRNA. Individuals who were homozygous for the ancestral A-allele had more conduct disorder behaviors than individuals with the G-allele.84 Another study found an association of a functional polymorphism in miR-124-1, which targets genes such as BDNF and DRDF, and aggressiveness, which could explain the effect of this miRNA on aggressive behavior.85 Recently, a gene-based association study showed potential involvement of DICER1 in suicide pathogenesis.86 DICER1 has a critical role in miRNA biosynthesis. Regulatory roles of miRNAs in polyamine gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of depressed suicide individuals have also been demonstrated.87 More recently, differential expression of miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of patients with bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia was identified; however, when suicides were separated from individuals who died from other causes, a subset of miRNAs were distinctly dysregulated in suicide subjects independent of psychiatric diagnosis.88 This raises an interesting possibility that there are miRNAs that may be involved in the regulation of brain circuits underlying behaviors associated with suicide across diagnostic boundaries.",

In addition, a large core co-expression module was identified, consisting of miRNAs that are strongly correlated with each other across individuals of the LH group but not with the NLH or the tested control group. The presence of such a module implies that the normal homeostatic miRNA response to shock is not merely absent or blunted in LH rats; rather, gene expression networks are actively reorganized in LH rats, which may give rise to a distinctive persistent phenotype. It will be critical, in the future, to identify the role of miRNA in regulating gene expression following stressful life events and modulation of circuits essential for the development and maintenance of endophenotypes associated with suicidal behavior.",

Similar to human 5-HIAA findings, both 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, as well as 5-HT turnover, are negatively correlated with levels of aggression in rodents.103, 104 Administration of the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor para-chlorophenylalanine has been reported to increase aggression in both mice and rats.105, 106 Pharmacological studies have implicated 5-HT in control of impulsivity in the contexts of decreased latency to attack,106, 107 the five-choice serial reaction time test, and other tests of motor impulsivity,108 and some, but not all studies, indicate 5-HT-induced changes in tests of cognitive impulsivity.108, 109, 110, 111, 112 Serotonergic modulation of impulsive aggression implicated in suicide vulnerability can be studied in animal model systems in a straightforward manner within a context relevant to suicidal behavior.",

The forebrain 5-HT1B heteroreceptors determine adult aggressive behavior during development, while adult expression of a different population of 5-HT1B heteroreceptors modulates impulsive behavior.116 Such a dissociation of the neural circuits underlying these two suicide-relevant endophenotypes may have important implications for prevention strategies and pharmacotherapies targeting the 5-HT1B receptor system.116",

            "text": "Animal models may also help to clarify the findings regarding gene associations in the 5-HT system, and suicide-related endophenotypes. Associations have been studied for various serotonergic genes, including tryptophan hydroxylase genes: TPH1; TPH2, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 5-HT, 5-HT transporter gene: specifically, the 5-HT transporter-linked polymorphic region in SLC6A4, 5-HT receptor genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR1B, HTR2C and monoamine oxidase A and B genes: MAOA, MAOB. In general, the results are inconsistent, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. Likewise, 5-HT receptor meta-analyses provide a heterogeneous picture, but in some cases, animal research can help clarify the putative role of a particular polymorphism.117 For instance, a HTR2B premature stop codon identified in the Finnish population is associated with severe impulsivity. Similarly, Htr2b knockout mice exhibit increased impulsivity and enhanced locomotor activity.118 Likewise, much work has been done in vitro to elucidate the putative functional mechanism underlying a common single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs6295, in the promoter of the HTR1A gene, which has been inconsistently associated with increased suicide risk.119, 120 These studies suggest that the G-allele of rs6295 may increase 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression in serotonergic neurons. Mouse models with selectively altered 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels have demonstrated a role for these receptors in modulating stress-coping behaviors.121, 122 Although these studies do not demonstrate a direct, functional role for rs6295, they support the idea that naturally occurring variation in 5-HT1A receptor levels within the human population, such as those potentially attributable to rs6295, may be behaviorally relevant.",

The imbalance of the kynurenine metabolites is evident in patients prone to suicidal behavior and may indicate a potential inherent vulnerability to stress and inflammation.129 Suicide attempters show elevated plasma kynurenine levels compared with non-suicidal depressive patients, who have levels of kynurenine similar to controls with no history of depression.130 There is no apparent activation of the kynurenine pathway, at least in the peripheral blood, of depressed patients without current suicidal thoughts.131 Consistent with these observations, Steiner et al.132 showed increased expression of QUIN-reactive microglia cells in the brains of depressed patients who died by suicide.",

Furthermore, increased QUIN in the central nervous system was associated with a genetic variant in the ACMSD gene (C allele of the ACMSD single nucleotide polymorphism rs2121337; more prevalent in attempters than in controls). In conclusion, the ultimate fate of inflammation may depend on the ultimate neuroprotective versus excitotoxic outcome dictated by the (genetically determined) level of activity of downstream enzymes on the kynurenine pathway, such as ACMSD. In some individuals, the ACMSD activity may be high enough to neutralize, and even reverse, excitotoxic consequences of inflammation. In contrast, certain individuals, such as some among those who attempt suicide, may have limited ACMSD activity, with a cascading excitotoxic outcome in inflammation via the kynurenine pathway. This may explain some of the inconsistent findings across individual patients. ACMSD activity could be modeled in genetically modified rodents to evaluate its effects on endophenotypes of suicidal behavior, and screen for potential beneficial reduction of endophenotypic measures with ACMSD-targeting medications.",

An early study (1993) revealed that levels of soluble IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) are elevated in blood samples from suicide attempters.138 The plasma levels of cytokines IL-6 and TNF are increased, and those of IL-2 are decreased, in suicide attempters compared with both non-suicidal depressed patients and healthy controls.139 A composite inflammatory index, consisting of the sum of z-scores for C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF, is associated with the occurrence of suicidal ideation, independent of both the severity of depression and whether the patients recently attempted suicide.140 Meta-analyses on this topic concluded that there are indeed aberrant cytokine levels in blood, CSF, and postmortem brain samples of patients who died by suicide.141, 142, 143 Blood levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 appear to be most robustly associated with suicidal behavior143 among many markers of inflammation. In support of these meta-analyses, a recent gene-expression study showed that biological mechanisms related to stress, inflammation, and apoptosis may underlie, at least partly, suicidality and suicidal behavior.144 As a consequence, it has been suggested that suicide-risk assessment in the clinics might be improved by measuring peripheral inflammatory markers. Related biomarkers that have been associated with suicidality are blood levels of S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) and C-reactive protein. Falcone et al.145 reported that serum levels of S100B, a marker of inflammation in the central nervous system, were related to the intensity of suicidal ideation in teenagers with depression and psychosis.",

Specific cytokines are able to bind to specific neuronal receptors and thereby regulate neurotransmission. Endophenotypes associated with suicidal behavior, such as aggression, have been exacerbated (at least partially) by the effects of individual cytokines. For instance, IL-1\u03b2 injected into the medial hypothalamus or dorsal periaqueductal gray acts on IL-1 type I receptors (IL-1RI) and 5-HT2 receptors to potentiate aggression in a feline model.146, 149, 159 An alternative pathway was uncovered by injecting IL-2 into the midbrain periaqueductal gray, which increases aggression through neurokinin NK (1) receptors.147 Moreover, TNF also appears to induce aggression. Mice lacking the TNF receptor do not exhibit aggressive behavior in the resident-intruder test.150 Individual cytokines might have very specific effects in the brain, and much still remains to be explored. In addition, as mentioned in earlier sections, inflammatory factors are modulators of the activity of enzymes in the kynurenine pathway producing neuroactive metabolites with effects on glutamate receptors. Finally, inflammation in the brain changes the turnover and metabolism of monoamines, including dopamine and 5-HT, and can thus have profound effects on several neurotransmitter systems. Importantly, several anti-inflammatory and kynurenine pathway-targeting medications are available and are of high interest for experimental testing in animals and then in patients with suicidal depression, based on the above observations. These medications may include anti-inflammatory agents, minocycline (through decreased microglia activation), glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitors (expected to reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines and aggressive behaviors), and infliximab (a monoclonal antibody against TNF).160 Although many are already United States FDA approved for other indications, these medications should first undergo a battery of testing in animals establishing their potential for improving depressive-like symptoms, aggression, impulsivity, and decision-making, to select the most suitable drugs for subsequent clinical trials in psychiatric patients.",

Decreased testosterone levels have been correlated with increased propensity for depression175, 176, 177 and suicide attempts,178, 179, 180, 181 whereas increased testosterone has been associated with increased aggression in men.182 Moreover, it has been shown that women are more likely to attempt suicide when estrogen and progesterone levels are low. Suicide attempts made under these conditions have greater severity.183 Furthermore, perimenopausal women have higher suicidal ideation rates compared with women in pre- or postmenopause stages or compared with men, independent of mood disorders.184 In contrast to women, increased progesterone levels in adolescent men have been associated with increased suicidal thoughts and behavior.185 Although clinical studies have been designed to unravel the exact role of the menstrual cycle and female hormones in relation to suicidal behavior, results have been controversial with some studies reporting no relationship.186, 187 However, other studies report a higher risk of suicide during the premenstrual phase,188, 189, 190 menstruation,190, 191, 192, 193 or during the first and fourth weeks of the menstrual cycle.194 However, the majority of these studies based their assessment of menstrual cycle phases on interview methods, rather than an objective measurement. Moreover, postmortem studies investigating the role of menstrual cycle phase by assessing endometrial histology cannot avoid bias, as some suicides have been reported as non-suicidal fatalities.195 Therefore, animal models of suicide will be helpful to study the exact role of gonadal hormones in suicidal behavior, or endophenotypes associated with such behaviors.",

For instance, administration of progesterone, or both estrogen and progesterone, decreases impulsive behavior in ovariectomized rats.196 Moreover, in male rats, gonadectomy decreased impulsive action in the five-choice serial reaction time task compared with intact rats, suggesting that low testosterone levels might be associated with decreased impulsivity.197 In contrast, ovariectomy increased impulsive action in females in the same task.197 In addition, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and progesterone administration have been shown to manifest antidepressant effects in rodents, as assessed by the forced-swim test.198, 199, 200 Consistently, testosterone or estradiol replacement prevented anhedonia phenotypes in gonadectomized male rats.201 On the other hand, increased testosterone levels are positively correlated with increased aggression in male rodents202, 203 and administration of medroxyprogesterone, a form of progesterone, increases male\u2013male aggression and decreases male\u2013female aggression in monkeys.204 Interestingly, the gene encoding for estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) is required for high levels of aggression in male mice ,205 whereas mice lacking the estrogen receptor beta (ER\u03b2) gene are characterized by a hyperaggressive phenotype,206 further demonstrating a role of gonadal hormones in endophenotypes associated with suicidal behavior. Overall, the findings from both clinical and preclinical studies suggest that circulating levels of gonadal hormones may affect suicide-related endophenotypes and the vulnerability to suicide.",

These measures satisfy criteria for endophenotypes being heritable, associated with suicidal behavior, state independent, and co-segregated with suicidal behavior in families. In particular, retrospective studies suggest that suicide attempts are linked with aggression.212, 213, 214, 215 These associations also seem to hold for death by suicide. For example, Brent et al.,216 using the psychological autopsy method, reported that adolescents who died by suicide have higher levels of lifetime aggression than the healthy controls. These associations are independent of psychopathology.217 Prospective studies confirmed an association between higher levels of aggression and suicidal behavior.218 Moreover, the familial transmission of suicidal behavior appears to be mediated by transmission of impulsive aggression.211, 219 Family studies provide additional support for the association of aggression and suicide. For example, first-degree relatives of individuals with suicide attempts or ideation have a significantly higher history or levels of aggression.219, 220, 221, 222 Consistently, higher ratings of aggression are documented in families with a higher incidence of suicide attempts.17 However, the impact of witnessing aggression or abuse or being a victim of aggression or abuse cannot be disregarded. The use of animal model approaches presents opportunities to study the role of suicide risk factors in mediating aggression and impulsivity.",

Several retrospective studies have shown that suicide attempters and completers score higher on measures of impulsivity than controls.212, 214, 223, 224, 225, 226 Retrospective studies assessing suicide attempters have found that quantitative laboratory measures indicate higher levels of impulsivity.227, 228 In addition to retrospective studies examining impulsivity and suicidal behavior, several prospective studies have been carried out that look at baseline traits in relation to future suicidal behavior. For example, a study by Caspi et al.229 found that a group of toddlers that had initially been labeled as impulsive showed a higher subsequent frequency of suicidal behavior later in life. These data indicate that impulsivity is likely to be a stable trait over time and that this characteristic at a young age predisposes to suicidal behavior later in life. A separate study followed patients with mood disorders for 2 years. Subjects who attempted suicide during the follow-up had higher scores on a self-report of impulsivity at the beginning of the study.218 In terms of genetic epidemiology, among suicidal probands, those who had siblings who also attempted suicide showed the highest levels of impulsivity (as well as impulsive aggression).230 These data indicate that suicidal behavior and impulsivity may load together in families, thus further strengthening the impulsivity\u2013suicidal behavior relationship.219, 222 What remains unknown is the relative contribution of kinship versus household exposure to environmental effects. Although almost impossible to tease apart in clinical samples, except in very special circumstances (for example, studying suicidal behavior in Old Order Amish), efficiently investigating \u2018nature' versus \u2018nurture' in relationship to impulsive aggression strongly supports a need for the use of animal models.",

It has been hypothesized that poor decision-making would influence the choice of immediately rewarding outcomes (for example, cessation of psychological pain) through long-term maladaptive solutions (suicidal act), when experiencing distressing events. Decreased activation of the lateral OFC during risky versus safe choices was associated with poorer decision-making in suicide attempters,233 suggesting that the decreased ability of these patients to correctly learn to recognize long-term risk in uncertain situations may represent key processes in the vulnerability to suicidal behavior.236 This bolsters the neuroanatomical hypothesis proposed by the results of postmortem and imaging studies,164, 237 suggesting that impaired serotonergic input to the prefrontal cortex may modulate the vulnerability to suicidal behavior.18",

Modeling decision-making in animal models has strong potential to address these questions. Indeed, rodent versions of the IGT (r-IGT) exhibit good face and construct validities.249, 250 5-HT transporter levels modulate long-term decision-making in this task in the rat (as shown in humans).251 r-IGT impairment is associated with a decrease in 5-HIAA levels in the OFC in a rat chronic pain model.252 The links observed in such models between 5-HT metabolism, OFC function, and decision-making are of relevance, as individual deficiencies in these three parameters have been implicated in suicide vulnerability. Reviewing studies based on the r-IGT, van den Bos et al.253 recently proposed that two different prefrontal-striatal networks were involved in task-progression in the r-IGT: an emotional/limbic system involved in assessing and anticipating the value of different options in the early stages of the task (learning task contingencies), and a cognitive control system involved in instrumental goal-directed behavior in later stages (behavior directed toward long-term options, reinforcement/punishment). Thus, animal models have the advantage to define complex neurocognitive and anatomical processes involved in decision-making and to examine developmental and environmental influences on decision-making.254",

Models of transcranial direct current stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in small animals have been adapted and tested in a wide range of behavioral paradigms263, 264 as they provide a powerful tool to identify the mechanisms by which transcranial direct current stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation modulate neural networks and the optimal parameters of stimulation, which could lead to more effective clinical interventions.",

This comparative paradigm could be used further in testing these alternative interventions for endophenotypes of suicide in animal models.",

            "text": "Neuroinflammation secondary to TBI is a cardinal feature of TBI and may serve as an endophenotype that can be evaluated in animal models. Mounting evidence indicates that neuroinflammatory processes start immediately after the initial TBI, and persist and worsen with time, contributing to the neurodegenerative process. Both microglia and astrocytes have important roles in neuroinflammation. Microglia are rapidly activated following TBI, which is manifested in: (i) morphological changes such as hypertrophy and de-ramification of processes; (ii) enhanced migratory and phagocytic activities; and (iii) production of inflammatory mediators including leukotrienes, cytokines and chemokines.348, 349 Astrocytes become reactive following TBI, which are manifested in: (i) increased proliferation (astrogliosis); (ii) migration towards injured tissues to form a glial scar; (iii) hypertrophy with increased expression of intermediate filaments (for example, glial fibrillary acidic protein); and (iv) the production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors that act via autocrine and paracrine signaling.348, 349 Although the initial activation of microglia350 and astrocytes is critical to wound healing, prolonged activation can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of damaging events that drive the pathogenic processes underlying neurodegeneration. Evidence suggests that the elevation of markers such as IL-6 and C-reactive protein within the first 24 h post-trauma leads to worse outcomes for TBI.349, 351, 352 The increase in cerebral inflammatory response, including microglial and astroglial activation, is prolonged, lasting months or years, and is believed to contribute to the evolving symptomatology and pathology, thereby highlighting inflammation as a potential treatment target long after the acute trauma.349, 353, 354 For example, certain anti-inflammatory pharmacological interventions including statins, cyclosporine A, and glucocorticoids, have been investigated in animals and are undergoing clinical trials in TBI.355 Molecular consequences of TBI, such as cytokine activation and elevated levels of kynurenines356, 357 have been recently linked with suicidal behavior (see 'inflammation' section). It is thus plausible that neuroinflammation following TBI, at least in part, biologically mediates the link between TBI and suicidal behavior, and that anti-inflammatory interventions now studied could reduce the excess burden of suicidal behavior in TBI. Hypotheses exploring the links between TBI, inflammation, and suicidal thoughts and behavior, could be studied in animal models of TBI, focusing on endophenotypes of suicidal behavior and potential immune-mediating mechanisms.",

            "text": "In summary, in humans, TBI elevates the expression of certain endophenotypes of suicidal behavior, and increases risk of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, and suicide. Of interest to the thesis of this review, is whether or not TBI in animal models also increases either the molecular endophenotypes or cognitive and behavioral traits related to suicidal behavior. Neuroinflammation is a well-documented consequence of TBI in rodents,358 and negative behavioral outcomes of TBI, such as increased anxiety-related behaviors, can be prevented or reversed by drugs that inhibit microglial activation.359, 360 Cope et al.361 found that a controlled impact to the frontal cortex resulted in anhedonia, as measured in the sucrose preference test in rats. Consistently, studies in both mice362, 363, 364 and rats365, 366 have found that TBI also increases measures of behavioral despair as measured in the forced-swim test. Negative findings have also been reported,367, 368, 369, 370 but TBI paradigms in rodents frequently involve more limited and localized injury, and, based on studies in humans,347 behavioral effects would only be anticipated when relevant circuits are impacted by the injury. The tests of motor activity are consistent with increased impulsivity in rodents following TBI (for review, see ref. 371). In line with these findings, TBI in rats impairs impulse control in the five-choice serial reaction time task in association with neuroinflammation.372 Based on their findings, the authors concluded that neuroinflammation may represent a treatment target for impulse control impairments following injury. Few studies have evaluated the effects of TBI on aggressive behaviors in rodents (for review, see ref. 371), and this remains an important area for future studies.",

In this context, while controversial, the United States FDA has issued warnings regarding possible pro-suicidal effects of anticonvulsants.382 Thus, these potential alternative treatments for treating mood disorders do not have the evidence to support a beneficial role in reducing suicide/suicide behavior risks that lithium does, further increasing the need to understand whether, and what, is unique about lithium's impact on the neurobiological underpinnings of suicidal behavior. Furthermore, while lithium has some antidepressant actions, antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, at least in some populations,383 have been associated with an increased risk of attempting suicide in some studies.

One enigma posed by these data is that the levels of lithium in the drinking supply are calculated to result in daily doses of only approximately 1%, or in some cases, close to 0.1% of typical clinical doses.392 The results have been inconsistent regarding possible greater effects in either males385 or females.386 Lithium's mechanism of action relevant to these findings remains to be elucidated, especially considering that most preclinical studies have been performed with lithium doses that achieve blood levels observed with the treatment of mood disorders.393 It is also worth considering\u2014and could be experimentally addressed in animal models\u2014that the alternative interpretation of these data is that low lithium levels are a risk factor for suicide, rather than higher lithium levels being a protective factor. Of relevance, continuous exposure to similar concentrations of lithium to those found in drinking water, have been shown to reduce mortality in a C. elegans model.394 Investigation is needed to explore the possibility that lithium may interact with a unique molecular target to reduce suicide risk, both at levels proven efficacious for the treatment of mood disorders, and at lower doses that may have efficacy for reducing suicidal behaviors.",

Mood stabilizers often affect common molecular targets395 but they do not all decrease suicide risk; therefore, future research may identify the neurobiological changes that lithium brings about, but which other mood stabilizers do not.395, 396 Lithium may exert its antisuicidal actions by modifying aggressive and impulsive behaviors. This hypothesis is supported by numerous double blind, placebo-controlled studies suggesting an anti-aggressive effect of lithium across various populations.397, 398, 399, 400 The results of randomized, placebo-controlled studies also suggest that lithium decreases human impulsivity. However, the evidence for such an effect is not as strong as for aggression, and concurrent diagnoses of pathological gambling and bipolar disorder in some studies make the interpretation complicated.398, 401, 402 Lithium's attenuation of suicide endophenotypes, including aggression and impulsivity, can also be readily modeled in rodent models using behavioral tests.403, 404, 405 Direct comparison with other mood stabilizers, such as valproate, may be beneficial. For example, while valproate can attenuate aggression in some animal tests, it is not as effective as lithium in reducing impulsivity in certain paradigms.404, 406, 407 Uncovering the mechanisms leading to these differences might help to pinpoint the specific antisuicidal actions of lithium. One strategy has been to investigate the molecular actions of lithium at the genetic and neurobiological levels using various inbred and transgenic mouse models.393, 408, 409, 410 Nonhuman animal studies allow the consideration of time course and dose\u2013response experiments.411, 412 Data indicating that environmental exposure to lithium (based on concentrations in the water supply) is inversely proportional to suicide rates, at least on a population basis, suggest the utility of determining whether there is an unusual dose response curve for lithium's impact on aggressive behaviors or other models of suicide endophenotypes in nonhuman animals. As potential molecular actions of lithium are identified, it would be useful to examine whether dose\u2013response relationships are evident concerning the impact on these targets, which might explain the apparent effectiveness at particularly low doses as those measured in the water supply. Lithium was recently associated with improved decision-making in bipolar patients.413 The molecular dissection of the effects of lithium on impulsivity (potentially through modulating 5-HT neurotransmission) may help to identify potential mechanisms underlying the antisuicidal effect of lithium, and provide new molecular targets for medications that reduce the risk of suicide.",

The need to address suicidal behavior risk is often acute, while the time frame for experiencing any adverse effects from lithium treatment is often over years to decades. Adverse effects of lithium on end organs such as the kidneys, thyroid, and parathyroid glands typically take years to even begin to manifest. For instance, in some cases, such as renal insufficiency in men under the age of 60 years, individuals receiving one or more lithium prescriptions, and control individuals, have renal function that appears indistinguishable for more than 20 years,414 yet, the methodology used to examine such long time frames has limitations. An ideal treatment for suicidal behavior should lack any possible concern about gradually accruing end organ damage. This is an opportunity where investigations in animals would help advance the search for a compound that would convey some or all of the benefit of lithium on suicidal behavior (or at least the most appropriate endophenotypes), while not sharing lithium's adverse effects. Last, the possibility of \u2018rebound' mood episodes or suicidal behavior after lithium discontinuation is a possible limitation to its use as a short-term suicide prevention strategy.415 Animal models may allow investigation of whether rebound aggressiveness, impulsivity, or other behaviors occur after sudden withdrawal of lithium, but not of other medications. Thus, it can be appreciated that animal research with lithium has great potential to clarify its mechanisms of actions and potentially allow the development of lithium-like, yet safer, medications, establish dose response and identify safety-based approaches to mitigate side effects to be further tested clinically in humans.",

The indication is specifically for reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia. In a large randomized controlled trial (InterSEPT study, n=980), clozapine was associated with a reduction in suicidal behavior and rescue hospitalizations compared with olanzapine, although not suicide deaths (overall, eight suicides were observed).416 Clozapine has effects on a large number of neurotransmitter receptors, including multiple dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptor subtypes.417 It is not known why clozapine exerts these antisuicidal behavior effects, or for certain the degree to which they may be related to its impact on treatment of refractory schizophrenia. It is hypothesized that clozapine's nonselectivity for neurotransmitter receptors may underlie its distinct efficacy.418 Clozapine's distinct reduction in mood symptoms in patients with schizophrenia may be important to its effects of reducing suicidal behaviors.419 The impact of these or other candidate mechanisms on suicidal behavior has yet to be elucidated. Studies with clozapine could provide valuable clues to the neurobiology of suicide in animal models and may include an assessment of common mechanisms of action between lithium and clozapine. For example, similar to anti-aggression-like effects of lithium, clozapine has also been demonstrated to reduce aggressive behaviors in a chronically stressed mouse model.420 As is also the case for lithium, research concerning how to prevent some of clozapine's sizable side-effect burden may help make it more desirable for wider use, or identify a clozapine-like molecule that preserves the efficacy but not the toxicity of clozapine.",

Thus, it remains to be confirmed whether ketamine has similar actions as lithium does on impulsivity and aggression relevant to suicidal behavior. Considering the rapid-acting nature of ketamine on suicidality in general, and suicidal thoughts, in particular, ketamine may be impacting suicidality in a manner distinct from those of lithium or clozapine. The recent finding that ketamine's in vivo conversion to a hydroxynorketamine metabolite is necessary and sufficient for its antidepressant actions, without its side effects, in mice presents an additional opportunity to understand the mechanism whereby ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts.433",

Therefore, screening and/or understanding why these effects are observed using animal models may be useful. For instance, rimonabant, an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1, was initially marketed as an anti-obesity drug.434 However, after some time of use in clinical practice, it was removed from the market due to concerns about increased suicide risk.435 Later rodent studies demonstrated that chronic treatment with this drug increased immobility time in the forced-swim test and increased anhedonia as measured by sucrose preference.436 Rimonabant has also been shown to decrease 5-HT levels in the frontal cortex, and to adversely affect neurogenesis and immune function.436 Of note, effects of rimonabant on impulsivity measures in animals have been equivocal. Although the drug increased impulsivity in the delay-discounting paradigm, it decreased some impulsive behaviors on the five-choice serial reaction task, which measure different subdomains of impulsivity.437, 438, 439",

The effects of undergoing current and previous drug treatments, and compensatory mechanisms in response to comorbid substance abuse, psychiatric or medical conditions and treatments only further complicate matters. Based on cumulative results, a general model has been proposed postulating that vulnerability to suicidal behavior is mediated in part by an important underlying genetic predisposition interacting with environmental and probable epigenetic factors throughout the lifespan. This combination of risk factors then modifies the function of neuronal circuits involved in behavioral modulation, thus rendering an individual more likely to engage in a suicidal act18, 450 (Figure 1). However, the factors that lead to suicide are tremendously complex, multifaceted, and heterogeneous. Using animal model approaches that allow us to experimentally study the neurobiology underlying suicide endophenotypes is a promising and much needed layer in suicide research. The planned expanded use of research domain criteria, versus categorical symptom checklist-based diagnosis, presents a further opportunity to support such an endeavor.452 Although our review is broad, it is by no means comprehensive. We did not include several translatable domains that are associated with increased suicide risk and potential targets for interventions. These include sleep impairment, substance use disorders, and mixed mood states. Furthermore, the review did not include complex interactive models of suicidal behavior, the modeling interactive effects of risk factors, and the domain of helplessness that has human and animal correlates.453 Although highly valuable for their translational relevance, knowledge is lacking to construct these multivariable models before answering the simpler questions proposed in this review.",

In addition, animal studies have been crucial in validating observations from human samples, where studies are limited by ethical considerations and where access to brain tissue is restricted to rare postmortem samples. Furthermore, confounding factors, such as comorbidities, different ages, and different life experiences, are unavoidable in human samples. Although informative of changes associated with patient histories, psychiatric illnesses and suicidal behavior, the use of postmortem brain samples precludes the study of molecular changes occurring at the onset of suicidality. The discrete and dynamic changes occurring at the onset of disease may be the point at which clinical intervention would be the most beneficial.

With the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 and other genome-editing technologies, it is now more straightforward to directly model human genetic variants in mice.455 Such models provide an invaluable opportunity to also investigate gene by environment interactions and identify sensitive developmental periods, two factors that may contribute to the lack of replication of many genetic associations. Such approaches may help clarify the literature regarding genetic variants implicated in suicide456 and provide insight into the circuit-based mechanisms that contribute to different suicide-implicated endophenotypes.",
