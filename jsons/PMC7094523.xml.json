Visitors perform the Hajj over a period of five or six days, staying in a tent city outside of Mecca. The timing of the Hajj follows a lunar calendar, occurring 10 or 11 days earlier each year according to the Gregorian calendar. From 2011 to 2018, it has moved from early November to mid-August. In this work, we will not take this drift into account.",

An alternative is to fix the time of mass gathering event and let the phase \u03c4 of the contact rate vary. The two approaches are equivalent; we adopt the second approach. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the mass gathering population is maximized approximately between day 15 and day 48 each year. Thus, the mass gathering event occurs during the height of the transmission season if \u03c4 \u2208 [15, 48]. (We note that the Hajj itself is much shorter than this period, but disease transmission can occur before and after the religious festival, as long as people are gathered.

Following the approach of Wang and Zhao [11], for each value of \u03c4, the monodromy matrix associated with Eq. (22) was used to calculate R0 according to Lemma 1. The disease-free space is unstable when the solid blue curve lies above the dashed red line, and is stable when the solid blue curve lies below the dashed red line. Thus, Fig. 3 shows clearly that the timing of the mass gathering relative to the peak in the seasonality of the disease transmissibility can have a dramatic effect on the possibility of an outbreak.

We do this for four different values of \u03c4 corresponding to holding the mass gathering event when the contact rate is maximized, and with phase shifts of 3, 6 and 9 months. In each case, \u03f5 is varied from 0 (corresponding to no seasonality) to 0.4 (corresponding to minimums and maximums in the contact rate that are 40% lower and higher than the average value). We find that if the mass gathering occurs when the contact rate is maximized (red curve), then R0 increases linearly with \u03f5. On the other hand, if the mass gathering occurs when the contact rate is minimized (blue curve), then R0 decreases linearly with \u03f5. If the mass gathering occurs half-way between these times (green and black curves), then the effect on R0 of varying \u03f5 (even quite significantly) is negligible. This is likely due to the fact that the contact rate is near its mean during these periods, and so varying \u03f5 has very little impact on the contact rate until after the gathering has concluded. (We note that all four curves show the same value of R0 (approximately 0.9905) when \u03f5=0, as expected since the value of \u03c4 is irrelevant if there is no seasonality.) This suggests, in agreement with Fig. 3, that it is better to hold mass gatherings when the seasonal infectiousness is minimized. For a recurring mass gathering for which the timing is not easily adjusted, such as the Hajj, Fig. 3 suggests that preparation for disease outbreaks should be increased in years when the gathering takes place at a time of elevated seasonal infectiousness.",

This gives a total size for the mass gathering of slightly over 2 million individuals. The functions \u03b8j are identical for j=1,2,3,4 and represent the per capita return rate to location j. Thus, the long period at which \u03b8j is at its maximum corresponds to exponential decay in the number of attendees from location j. The functions \u03d5j and \u03b8j are taken to be periodic with a period of 365 days so that the mass gathering event is periodic. (We ignore leap years, we also ignore the fact that the timing of the Hajj follows a lunar calendar).",

In Fig. 5(a), we let \u03d5\u00afj, for j=2,3,4 vary (simultaneously) between 0 and 0.02. We see that as the travel rates from the other regions are reduced, the value of R0 is also reduced, reaching a positive minimum value (at the left-hand side of the plot) when no visitors from the other regions are allowed to attend (\u03d5\u00af2=\u03d5\u00af3=\u03d5\u00af4=0). Overall, we see that R0 varies from less than 0.7 to greater than 1.2. This shows that the potential for disease outbreak can be radically transformed by a mass gathering event that includes individuals from disparate regions. In Fig. 5(b) \u03d5\u00afj for j=1,2,3,4 are all varied from 0 to values that are shown in Table 2. Here we see that R0 decreases as the travel rates (and hence the size of the gathering) are decreased, however a minimum value seems to be reached at approximately v=0.2 (corresponding to a mass gathering event that is only 20% as large). At this point, R0 is determined primarily by the parts of the system that do not relate directly to the mass gathering; thus, further reduction of the mass gathering has no appreciable effect on the size of R0. For contrast, in Fig. 5(a), even when \u03d5\u00af2,\n\u03d5\u00af3 and \u03d5\u00af4 are as small as 0, the mass gathering still has 700,000 visitors from within Saudi Arabia and so R0 is still strongly affected by transmission at the gathering.",

We require that \u03b8\u00afj be strictly greater than zero; otherwise, attendees from region j would never return home. Smaller values of \u03b8\u00afj mean that the mass gathering attendees return home more slowly, extending the duration of the event. Thus, it is expected that R0 is a decreasing function of \u03b8\u00afj, as is apparent in Fig. 6(a). From the figure, for the parameters in Tables 1 and 2, it seems unlikely that R0 can be reduced below 1 simply by increasing \u03b8\u00afj. It should be noted, though, that the function \u03b8(t) only becomes non-zero when t>b0=42; thus the effect of increasing \u03b8\u00afj is to prevent attendees from lingering longer after the main event has concluded. In Fig. 6(b), we see how R0 depends on the mass action coefficient \u03b2mmS for disease transmission at the mass gathering. If disease transmissibility at the event is low, then R0 does not significantly depend on \u03b2mmS as seen by the fact that the curve is quite flat. However, as \u03b2mmS grows, we enter a region where there is apparent linear growth in the basic reproduction number. This suggests that it is prudent to implement policies that reduce transmission at the mass gathering, however, at some point further effort in reducing transmission at the mass gathering has minimal impact; at this point it is likely better to put resources elsewhere.",

We note that the reason for individuals to not travel could be based on their own choice due to how they feel or it may be due to screening of travellers for infections. We also note that kj could be any value in the interval [0,1]. For the red curve, kj varies from 0 to 0.4 for all locations j. For the green curve, k\n1 is held fixed at 0.4 while k\n2, k\n3 and k\n4 are varied. It is evident that restricting travel of only the infected individuals from external locations (i.e. locations 2, 3, 4) has negligible impact on R0 - even if the restriction is total (i.e. k2=k3=k4=0). Restricting travel from all locations, including location 1 (as shown by the red curve) is also ineffective, resulting in approximately a 1.2% reduction in R0 (from 1.215 to 1.2) as kj is reduced from 0.4 to 0. This is in stark contrast to the result when all travel is stopped, as seen in Fig. 5 when the parameter \u03d5j is varied, which resulted in R0 being reduced from 1.2 to near 0.6.",

However, at the left-hand endpoint of the blue curve, with kj=0 for all j and with \u03b2m1S=0, there is supposed to be no entry of infecteds into the mass gathering. However, if one somehow got in, the disease would spread within the gathering since \u03b2mmS is positive. The distributed infected individual includes allowing infection at the gathering.

For many models, if the average life expectancy in the absence of disease is 1\u03bc, then the inclusion of latency with an average duration of 1\u03c3 reduces R0 by a factor of \u03c3\u03c3+\u03bc. Since this duration of latency is typically much shorter than life expectancy, this fraction is typically quite close to one and so the effect on R0 is small.",

A period of latency can significantly cut into the duration of the mass gathering, resulting in a larger reduction in R0. In Fig. 8\n, we present the analog of Fig. 3, showing how R0 varies with \u03c4 (the offset between the peak in transmissibility and the beginning of movement to the mass gathering) for a variant of our main model that includes a period of latency that lasts an average of two days. There seems to be an approximately 30% reduction in R0 when the mass gathering happens at peak transmissibility and an approximately 20% reduction in R0 when the mass gathering happens at the minimum transmissibility. The difference in reduction is likely due to the difference in how much of the next generation of infections occur at the mass gathering for the different values of \u03c4. This shows that future work should take full account of latency.",
