One is the redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and trainees into nonorthopaedic areas to assist with patient care for those afflicted with COVID-19. This may include both medical (general medicine or intensive care) and non-medical (administrative or ancillary) service lines. Commonly termed, \"redeployment\", the fundamental shift away from Orthopaedic clinical practice into needed non-Orthopaedic service lines grows in response to the increased demand necessary to care for COVID-19 patients. While tenured surgeons and wellestablished physicians in practice may have the political or personal choice to avoid redeployment into COVID-19 care, younger surgeons who are closer to their general medical training are at a potentially greater risk of being redeployed into the care of COVID-19 patients.",

It is unclear from the survey whether or not these were volunteer redeployments or dictated by the employers. It is important to realize that residents and fellows are all employed, albeit in potentially different models. As such, they may have less autonomy when it comes to the decision to participate in direct COVID-19 care. Employed young surgeons are in a similar situation, as opposed to private practice surgeons. We have also seen the rapid development of new models in response to this crisis that allows private practice surgeons immediate credentialing at hospitals for the purpose of COVID care. Under these unique circumstances there may be a transient monetary benefit for private practice surgeons, especially those less established or early in practice, to sustain their income using these redeployment initiatives. Although this was not captured in the survey, it is a growing trend in communities with high COVID-19 penetration.",

            "text": "According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2018 Census the majority of orthopaedic surgeons work in private practice, with 37.5% in an orthopaedic group and 18.1% in a hospital/medical center setting.(2) Roughly 18.1% of full time orthopaedists are employed by hospitals and 13.2% of part-time orthopaedists are employed. Under the current COVID-19 pandemic, this suggests that the majority of surgeons will be directly affected financially by the temporary ban on elective surgeries. This is not to suggest employed surgeons are not affected, but most likely their compensation structure provides a degree of insulation to the immediate impact of decreased revenue. Again this is likely impacted by regional variation and at the institutional level there will be significant differences between employment models. In some cases, there is no change and there has been a shift toward virtual visits and emergency cases. Hybrid models exist wherein clinical time is documented toward salaried compensation and non-clinical time is being debited from paid time off (PTO). In the most extreme circumstance, employed orthopaedic surgeons are joining the ranks of internal medicine and family practice physicians caring on the front lines for COVID-19 patients.",

The majority of young surgeons are still recovering from the financial debt associated with their training and may not have the fiscal reserves of their more senior colleagues. They are at a higher risk of financial hardship due to the crisis. As noted in this report, 40% had decreased monetary compensation, and another 15% had no monetary compensation. This 54% of our group may not have the financial savings and/or stability to be able to weather this storm, and may be forced to seek alternative avenues for loans or compensation. Total amount of student debt in the United States as now reached $1.6 trillion.(3) Financial concerns have long been reported among healthcare professionals, especially those going into programs such as orthopaedics with longer residency and fellowship requirements. Hwang et al performed a financial survey of their orthopaedic residents and reported that 48% had medical educational debt > $100,000 while 45% had debt >$200,000.(4) As educational debt increases, so too does the concern about managing that debt. In another survey of 3076 residents performed by Johnson et al, more than 60% reported educational debt greater than $150,000 and 12% greater than $300,000.(5) Equally important in this survey was the high interest rates, which was over 6% for 56% of respondents.",

            "text": "In the current crisis, it's important to understand the issue of interest rate. While short-term interest rates may be approaching 0%, long term rates are inherently different. Educational loans are not typically variable rates and rather fixed at the time of the loan. There may be an option to refinance some of these loans at lower rates (although again long term rates are not dropping as low as short term rates), the current portfolio will not change and as such the financial responsibility remains, irrespective of decreased monetary compensation as reported in our survey. As a result, there is a real concern for being able to maintain these financial responsibilities. This was partly alleviated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, passed by congress signed on March 27, 2020. As a part of this legislation, which provides relief for some with educational debt. Specifically, the loan payments will be suspended, interest free through September 20, 2020. (6) Although there are many provisions and nuances that may affect people differently, this does provide some relief. We found that 15% of respondents are generating no income whether functioning as an orthopaedic surgeon or volunteering for COVID-care. Despite the potential financial support this legislation provides, medical education does not typically provide finance training and most residents, fellows and young surgeons remain frustrated navigating these financial challenges. As a matter of fact, Jennings et al found that of the residents surveyed, only 4% had formal training in investing, personal finance or retirement. 75% felt less prepared for retirement than their peers who were not medical professionals. (7) When considering the specific group of trainees in residency and fellowship, an essential question to ask is whether or not they feel that they are prepared for practice given the disruption to their training. Do they feel the training they received was sufficient to confidently move forward in their careers? 84% of respondents reported they still felt comfortable completing the ABOS Part 2.",

This begs the question of whether or not shorter, \"mini\" fellowship programs may be beneficial moving forward to assist those with concerns about the completeness of their training in becoming proficient and confident to enter into practice. It may lead to an evolution in the educational curriculum such that certain areas of focus can be accomplished in finite amounts of time to augment an abbreviated clinical education.",

As the pandemic continues this concern continues to grow and the long term impact will be more profound. At the time of this survey, 10% reported they had intended to relocate their career and 3% of those have lost that opportunity. No doubt this creates a challenge professionally and personally for many and the hope is that new opportunities will arise moving forward.

We acknowledge that there are barriers at each level of training and were not able to quantify each in detail. For example residents still have to complete their ABOS Part 1 examination prior to fellowship or practice. Those whom have competed Part 2 of the ABOS may have different challenges that were uncaptured by this survey. We were not able to identify regional variations in practices or patterns with the questions being asked and acknowledge regional practice difference based on COVID-19 penetration could impact the results.
