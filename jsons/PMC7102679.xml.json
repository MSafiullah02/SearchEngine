Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that L. japonica flower possesses antibacterial [2], anti-inflammatory [3], and antiviral [4] and various other pharmacological effects. The flower is also used for prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndromes, H1N1 influenza, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease [5]. The quality of L. japonica mainly depends on the developmental period of the flower. The content of chlorogenic acid which is an important active ingredient [6] is high during early stages while it decreased during late stages of flower development [7]. The flowering period, from May to September, can be divided into five stages according to previous publication [8]: the juvenile bud stage (JBS), the third green stage (TGS), the complete white stage (CWS), the silver flowering stage (SFS), and the gold flowering stage (GFS). A deep explanation for content change of active ingredients during flower development of L. japonica has been not performed.",

            "text": "Flowering time is controlled by different pathways, including photoperiod, gibberellin, autonomous, and vernalization [9]. These multiple floral-promoting signals regulated the expression of common set of genes leading to changes in cellular metabolism [10]. The regulation analysis of carbohydrate metabolism [11], pigment biosynthesis and volatile scent compounds during flower development have been performed. The difference of carotenoids content during the flower petal development of marigold were explained by expression analysis of relative genes [12]. The level of transcripts and metabolites was harmonically up-regulated during scent and petal development [13]. The flower contains phenolics, flavonoids, and iridoid glycosides due to which it is the main organ with pharmacological activity [14]. As the chemical compounds show diversification in L. japonica and its related species, a systemic analysis is needed to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of the metabolic network during the floral development. Interactive biochemical networks [15], constituting co-regulation of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites results in physiological adjustments of the plant development. A systems biology approach based on omics technology can reconstruct these \u2018interactive biochemical networks\u2019 and help in identifying the interactions that exist between its components. An integrative analysis of transcriptome and metabolome has revealed the links between\u03b3-aminobutyric acid signaling, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle status/inositol phosphates, and jasmonate signaling in sensitive/tolerant rice cultivars under high night temperature stress [16]. A systemic approach provided new insights into complex post-transcriptional and translational hierarchies that govern crassulacean acid metabolism in Agave [17]. AGAMOUS-LIKE 22 (AGL22) was identified as a key hub gene in gene regulatory networks in Arabidopsis that linked changes in primary metabolism with the initiation of stress responses [18].",

As the lock mass, the ions C24H39O4\n+ (m/z 391.28429), C14H46NO7Si7\n+ (m/z 536.16536), and C16H52NO8Si8\n+ (m/z 610.18416) were used. Values for ion isolation window were set as follows: activation type was collision-induced dissociation, default charge state was 2, isolation width was 2.0 m/z, normalized collision energy was 35%, and activation time was 30 ms. Values for dynamic exclusion were determined as follows: repeat count was 2, repeat duration was 30 s, exclusion list size was 500 m sec, exclusion duration was 90 s, and exclusion mass width was \u00b11.5 Da. The ten most intense precursor ions above a threshold value of 500 were selected for collision-induced fragmentation. The acquired MS/MS spectra were used for protein identification.",

DTA files were generated from acquired raw data files and then converted to Mascot generic files using Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.4.0.288; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The parameters used in the Mascot searches were as follows: carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modification. Trypsin was specified as the proteolytic enzyme and one missed cleavage was allowed. Peptide mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance was set at 0.8 Da, and peptide charges were set at +2, +3, and + 4. An automatic decoy database search was performed as part of the search. Mascot results were filtered with the Mascot percolator to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of peptide identification [28]. False discovery rates for peptide identification of all searches were <1.0%. Peptides with a percolator ion score of >13 and a p-value <.05 were used for protein identification. The minimum requirement for the identification of a protein was two matched peptides and a p value <.05. Proteins identified in all biological replicates were used in this experiment. Proteins with the most significantly matched peptides were saved when peptides were common among different isoforms. Protein abundance was analyzed based on the emPAI value [29]. The mean of three emPAI values was divided by the sum of the emPAI values for all identified protein and multiplied by 100. Protein content was estimated by the molar fraction percentage (mol%).",

Furthermore, the late period (SFS and GSF) was well separated from the early period (JBS, TGS, and CWS) in PC1. In order to deeply reveal the potential variance in the floral period, the change of identified proteins among 5 developmental stages was evaluated by a multivariate statistical analysis using ANOVA approach. A total of 538 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were selected and employed for the further analysis (Supplemental Table 5). The Venn diagram was generated to show the overlap of the DAPs from 5 stages (Fig. 2B). There were 242, 231, 229, 207, and 174 DAPs in JBS, TGS, CWS, SFS, and GFS, respectively.

Until recently, studies have shown that the correlation between mRNA and protein expressions can be low due to various factors such as post transcription regulation. The stimulus, immune system process, and reproduction showed significant differences between transcript abundance and protein abundance in white spruce stems during the transition from active growth to dormancy [40]. The inconsistent expression patterns at mRNA and protein levels also occurred during rice early post-pollination [41]. Protein abundances reflect a dynamic balance among linked processes, spanning the transcription, processing, and degradation of mRNA to the translation, localization, modification, and programmed destruction of the proteins themselves. In order to reveal the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the floral development, the identified proteins were further analyzed in this study.

The triple mutant of fatty acid desaturase 3 (fad3), fad7, and fad8 in Arabidopsis produced negligible linolenic acid, leading to a low level of jasmonic acid (JA) content [43]. Pollen development is critical for linolenic acid or JA as severe reduction of the linolenic acid (LA) in Arabidopsis resulted in male sterility [43]. LA is one of the precursors for JA biosynthesis [44] and the lipoxygenase (a key enzyme for JA biosynthesis) [45], and it affects flower bud induction [46]. Furthermore, the LA cascade products like 9,10-\u03b1-ketol-octadecadienoic acid have strong flower-inducing activity [47]. In this study, it was demonstrated that unsaturated FAs had higher content in the early stages in L. japonica than the later stages (Supplemental Table 4). The high expression of lipoxygenase (Supplemental Table 2) and accumulation of LA (Supplemental Table 4) might perform an important role in inducing the early flower bud by increasing the JA level and accumulating LA cascade products.",

The intermediates of glycolysis serve as precursor for primary and secondary metabolites [48]. The identification of unique proteins involved in glycolysis in the early stages indicated that glycolysis might be in active state in early stages (Fig. 5). As it was proved that the activated glycolysis contributed to the accumulation of phenylpropanoids through the shikimic acid pathway [[49], [50]]. Previous study demonstrated that the content of chlorogenic acid was higher in bud stage than that in flower stage [7]. As the active compounds of L. japonica, chlorogenic acid, luteolin, and their precursors (phenylalanine and 4-coumarate) were observed to reduce in late stage (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Flavonoids play a key role in cellular protection under biotic and abiotic stresses [[51], [52], [53]], elimination of reactive oxygen species [54], and constitution of flower color pigment [55]. These results indicate that the significant accumulation of phenylpropanoids in the early stages from the activated glycolysis might endow high stress tolerance to the early flower cells of L. japonica and give us theoretical support for the utilization of L. japonica as medicinal materials.",

C3 cycle fixing carbon into sucrose and starch is essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and phenylpropanoids [56] and for isoprenoid biosynthesis from the methylerythritol pathway (MEP). A study demonstrated a small reduction in the TK activity inhibited photosynthesis and significantly decreased the levels of aromatic amino acids and phenylpropanoids [57]. Our study showed a downward trend on the whole of the process from erythrose 4-phosphate to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate based on the number of genes and proteins during the floral development of L. japonica (Supplemental Fig. 1). As this process is not only essential for maintaining active photosynthesis, but also provide the precursor metabolites for phenylpropanoid metabolism [58], it was inferred that the increased TK might play little role on promoting the photosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism. As a confirmation, we proved that the number of photosynthesis related genes and proteins was decreased (Fig. 1) and metabolites in phenylpropanoid metabolism were reduced or no increased at least in the late stages than those in the early stages (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).",

As a product of TK, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) can be transferred into DXPS by the action of deoyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) in MEP pathway. TK activity needs the presence of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) which is synthesized from thiamine, while the formation of thiamine is dependent on the G3P. This regulatory circuit was proved to exist to coordinate TK activity with availability of TPP [60]. The roles of TK in pepper fruits during the early onset of isoprenoid biogenesis was illustrated that overexpressed TK furnished the isopentenyl diphosphate necessary for increased carotenoid biosynthesis [61]. In our current study, FBPA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GAPD2), and PGK were increased in GFS compared with early stages and GAPD1 was unique in late stages, indicating an increased accumulation of G3P. TK was significantly increased in late stages compared with early stages and the MEP pathway related proteins DXPS, GGPS, and MPDM were unique in the late stages (Fig. 5). It has been demonstrated that the content of secologanic acid was increased during flower opening in L. japonica [7]. These results indicate that TK-contained regulatory circuit might be activated to contribute to the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbone in the late floral stages of L. japonica.",
