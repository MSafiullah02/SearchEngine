Both parasites have a world-wide distribution in owned cats (Feng and Xiao, 2011; Yao and Koster, 2015). While G. intestinalis is a well-known parasite of the small intestine, and veterinarians are familiar with the disease giardiasis, T. foetus is considered to be an emerging infection (Gookin et al., 2017; Gruffydd-Jones et al., 2013). Infection with T. foetus is associated with outbreaks of large bowel diarrhoea in <2 year old cats, yet the epidemiology is not fully understood (Gookin et al., 2004; Hale et al., 2009; Van der Saag et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Both feline giardiasis and trichomonosis present clinically in young animals, with the most consistent clinical sign being diarrhoea (Gookin et al., 2017, 2004). Often, both parasites are present as co-infection (Bell et al., 2010). Because of different treatment options for each disease, confirmation of presence of one or both pathogens is necessary (Bell et al., 2010; Gookin et al., 2006; Gunn-Moore and Lalor, 2011; \u0160lapeta et al., 2010). For G. intestinalis the in-clinic rapid diagnostic coproantigen assays are ideal, with extremely good sensitivity and specificity, and are therefore preferred for in-clinic diagnosis (Barbecho et al., 2018; Uiterwijk et al., 2018). However, no in-clinic rapid diagnostic coproantigen assay is available for T. foetus, therefore alternative tests need to be requested or undertaken. Faecal morphological examination is a good option; nevertheless, its sensitivity for both G. intestinalis and T. foetus are mediocre (Bell et al., 2010; Gookin et al., 2017). The most suitable approaches are molecular PCR based assays with verified high sensitivity and specificity (Gookin et al., 2017). PCR based assays in the form of PCR panels are becoming established tools in veterinary practice. On one hand, they are not in-clinic tests, but turnaround of 1\u20133 days makes them suitable as part of differential diagnostics in diarrhoea in young cats. Validation and cross validation between laboratories are urgently needed to elucidate the reliability of PCR panels to recognise their limitation and performance against set of reference assays.",

Samples were tested on the High-Plex instrument using the Small Animal Diarrhoea \u2013 HP 16-well (Cat.: 28174) test panel, or the in the Mini-Plex 12 system, using the Small Animal Diarrhoea \u2013 MP 16-well (Cat.: 78174) test panel. For the specific amplification of G. intestinalis the 18S gene of nuclear ribosomal DNA was targeted and for T. foetus the cysteine protease gene was used. The pathogen targets in both panel versions were identical. This assay includes an initial multiplexed short amplification followed by a single-target amplification, using SYBR Green chemistry. It tests for 14 targets: Campylobacter spp., Dientamoeba fragilis, Salmonella spp., G. intestinalis, Cryptosporidium, T. foetus, Toxoplasma gondii, parvovirus/panleukopenia virus, canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, feline coronavirus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Neospora caninum. It includes a reference PCR targeting a mammalian gene to test for sample adequacy and an artificial sequence (SPIKE) to check for the presence of inhibitors. The setup procedure in both MT-PCR system versions was as followed: In the first step, 50 \u03bcl reaction volumes containing Step 1 RNA mastermix (AusDiagnostics, Cat. 40340RNA), oil and 10 \u03bcL of each isolated DNA/RNA was subjected to 15 cycles in the MT-Processor (AusDiagnostics, Australia). After cycling, samples were automatically diluted and aliquoted by the MT-Processor into a 384 well plate (for High-Plex) or a 96 well plate (for Mini-Plex), supplied in the kit, containing step 2 primers for each target. The plate was then transferred to the specific real-time thermocycler and amplification conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 15 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s A melt curve was generated at the end from 72 \u00b0C to 94.8 \u00b0C at 0.4 \u00b0C intervals and analysed using the Easy-Plex results software (AusDiagnostics, Australia). A sample was recorded as test-positive using the \u2018auto-call function\u2019 of the Easy-Plex software, if the amplicon produced a single melting curve which was within 1.5 \u00b0C of the expected melting temperature, the height of the peak was higher than 0.2 dF/dT and the peak width was \u2264 3.8 \u00b0C (AusDiagnostics, Australia). Cycle threshold (Ct-values) and take-off values were recorded for each test-positive sample, and quantitative values for each parasite in each sample were determined using an automated comparison with Ct-values data determined for an internal spike-control (SPIKE; tube containing 10,000 copies of a synthesized oligonucleotide template and a specific primer set) for each sample tested (Stanley and Szewczuk, 2005). Each sample was also tested for the presence of amplifiable nucleic acids (i.e. extraction control) using a vertebrate reference gene (NONO).",

The MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea panel was revalidated between two laboratories and against single-plex assays for two main pathogens relevant in differential diagnostics in feline medicine. Both G. intestinalis and T. foetus are known to be associated with each other, yet the mainstream drug for G. intestinalis, metronidazole, is not efficacious for T. foetus (Bell et al., 2010; Gookin et al., 2017, 2007). The performance of the MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea panel for G. intestinalis was in good agreement, with excellent sensitivity and specificity compared to the TaqMan assay. The original G. intestinalis assay was validated for the human G. intestinalis Assemblage A and B (Stark et al., 2011; Verweij et al., 2003). Our study demonstrates that the assay is equally specific for the feline G. intestinalis Assemblage F, because all feline samples in this study that were genotyped were confirmed as G. intestinalis Assemblage F - the genetically defined subgroup specific for cats (Feng and Xiao, 2011). In clinical diagnostics the G. intestinalis assemblage is not determined for cat, dog or human samples (Gizzi et al., 2014; Madison-Antenucci et al., 2016; Stark et al., 2014; Verweij et al., 2004). Most research studies have demonstrated G. intestinalis Assemblage F being shed by cats; only in exceptional circumstances were the zoonotic G. intestinalis Assemblages A and B detected (Feng and Xiao, 2011; Gruffydd-Jones et al., 2013). Therefore, isolates of G. intestinalis causing disease in cats are not considered zoonotic (Gruffydd-Jones et al., 2013). In several circumstances, the G. intestinalis call by the automated profile of the MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea panel indicated ambiguity and requested the operator to check the result. A large proportion of such ambiguous G. intestinalis results were positive in the single-plex G. intestinalis reference assay, enabling adjustments of the automatic call parameters.",

            "text": "Unlike the G. intestinalis PCR performance, the T. foetus component of the MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea had only poor sensitivity but perfect specificity compared to the reference TaqMan-MGB assay. These differences in the sensitivity are likely the result of the different target genes used by the assays. The TaqMan-MGB assay uses an ITS-1 target, which is multi-copy gene and repeated several times in the genome of the parasite, whereas the MT-PCR assay for T. foetus uses the cysteine protease gene which is a single-copy gene. Diagnostics of T. foetus is difficult because of its poorly understood pathogenesis, intermittency and load of T. foetus shedding (Gookin et al., 2017). The faecal samples positive for T. foetus had a high proportion (53%, 16/30) of late amplifiers, determined by an arbitrary threshold of Ct-values >35. On the other hand, only one (2%, 1/41) G. intestinalis positive sample was considered a late amplifier (Ct-values >35). Such a high proportion of late amplifying samples positive for T. foetus suggests the low numbers of T. foetus in given samples reached the limit of detection for the T. foetus assay (McMillen and Lew, 2006). High sensitivity for T. foetus is desired in a clinical situation, where the aim is to quarantine or eliminate the pathogens from individual cat or a cattery. Verification of elimination of T. foetus post treatment should be compulsory, however, the probability of undetected occult T. foetus shedders may contribute to the maintenance of T. foetus in the cat populations, because multiple PCR tests are prohibitive for cat owners due to cost associated with such PCR testing. Availability of probe-based assays for both G. intestinalis and T. foetus enables multiplexing for simultaneous detection. Both published assays have been validated and are considered reference assays (McMillen and Lew, 2006; Verweij et al., 2003). The G. intestinalis assay has previously been implemented in a multiplex assay targeting human enteric pathogens with exceptional sensitivity and specificity in clinical samples (Verweij et al., 2004). Our multiplexed assay confirms exceptional performance of the G. intestinalis, yet highlights the difficulties with detection of T. foetus.",
