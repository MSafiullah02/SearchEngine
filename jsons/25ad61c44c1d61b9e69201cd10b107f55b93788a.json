For instance, the use of a standard surgical mask-that was current standard in Asian countries even before COVID-19 outbreak-encounters some reluctance in Europe and United States. 1, 5 The same applies to the need of physical or social distance between HCPs and patients or among HCPs themselves. 6 This is dramatically shown by the unexpected clustering of COVID-19 HCPs in the Western outbreak as compared with the Chinese experience.",

Aerosol generation, mainly to be attributed to coughing or exposure of the respiratory mucosa, may be antagonized by appropriate respirators, such as N95 or equivalents. 9,10 Of note, these were the same precautions widely used against Influenza transmission, before the population-based vaccination campaign marginalized its usefulness. On the other hand, protective measures tend to be jeopardized in Western countries by the lack of resources due to the unprecedented brisk surging of this outbreak that found unprepared most of the health systems in these countries. 11 In addition to direct preventive measures, indirect strategies aiming to reduce the chances of contacts between HCPs and patients have been advocated. 12 Postponing elective procedures in low-risk patients, especially if at high risk of COVID-19 death, triaging any patient for clinical/epidemiological riskfactors for COVID-19, and isolation and separation of all infected or high-risk cases are all effective strategies in the containment of the COVID-19 spreading. 8, 12 Aim of this position statement is the need of ISDE to address simultaneously all the operators involved in both GI endoscopy and surgery in order to define a common pathway that may be applied to those departments with special interest in upper GI diseases and their management. Operations may need to be canceled if the stock of these equipment runs low.",

Delivery of adequate protectors to all the staff that is in direct contact with patients.2. ISDE suggests that all the HCP staff is adequately and transparently instructed on COVID-19 risks and how to protect from it. This must include:a. Use of surgical mask, gloves, and hairnet to prevent COVID-19 hospital-based transmission. b. Daily self-triage for COVID-19 symptoms/signs (see below). c.

Surgical staff should also be minimized throughout the operation. This will not only reduce the risk of COVID transmission but also conserve PPE/surgical masks. No visitor should be allowed in all operating theaters and patient care areas. c. During transthoracic esophagectomy, if a bronchial blocker is used for one lung ventilation, all personnel should wear N95 respirator or equivalent due to the presence of open circuit in the ventilating machine. d. If laparoscopic procedure is to be performed, the use of device to filter the released CO 2 for aerosolized particles should be considered.12.
