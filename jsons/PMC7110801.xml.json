Goldman and Smith17 found that well-educated patients are better able to manage complicated self-care regimens in HIV/AIDS and diabetes. Other studies have found that education is linked to faster adoption of new medical technologies18 and that consumer knowledge is linked to the increased use of preventive care.19 In this study, the qualified levels of all three sections (knowledge, behavior, and skill) in the general population were significantly higher (p\n < 0.001) with a higher level of education, which is similar to the nationwide health literacy level of China.20, 21 At present, different intervention strategies aimed at populations with different levels of education should be implemented.",
