They are caused mainly by a heterogeneous group of viruses, including rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, coronaviruses, and certain strains of adenovirus\n1,\n2. Few antiviral therapies are currently approved and routinely used for VRTI. Most of these are specific inhibitors of influenza viruses\n3. Moreover, for most respiratory viruses, there is no licensed vaccine available\n4,\n5, with the exception of flu vaccines for which protection generally lasts only one flu season. Consequently, clinical management of individuals with VRTI is mostly restricted to supportive care\n5.",

The identified datasets are particularly relevant to our interest in understanding the pathobiology of VRTI and vaccination. As described in recent publications\n18,\n19, these datasets were loaded into a custom interactive web application, the\nGene Expression Browser (GXB), which enables easy access to large datasets and interactive visualization of our dataset collection related to VRTI and vaccination against respiratory viruses. It also provides access to demographic and clinical information. Importantly, the user can customize data plots by adding multiple layers of parameters (e.g. age, gender, sample type, type of infection, type of vaccine, sample collection time), modify the sample ordering and genes, and generate links (mini URL) that can be shared via e-mail or used in publications. Therefore, we are providing here a resource enabling browsing of datasets relevant to blood transcriptional responses to VRTI and vaccination that offers a unique opportunity to identify host genes and their regulation that may be of diagnostic and/or prognostic value, or that may be tested as novel correlates of protection in subsequent studies. For example, a comparative approach of the transcriptional response signatures between experimentally infected and vaccinated individuals could be used to identify common mechanisms that define the poor health outcomes versus strong protection. The ability to pool, compare and analyze the immune responses to different infections and vaccines, in different individuals and at various age, offers a unique opportunity for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of VRTI.",

Based on these criteria, 31 datasets were retained. These include datasets that were generated from whole blood or PBMCs of individuals who were either naturally (12) or experimentally infected (3) (with influenza viruses, RSV, Rhinovirus, Rotavirus) as well as from healthy, uninfected (age-matched) volunteers.

Then, the datasets were uploaded on the Gene Expression Browser (GXB), an interactive web application hosted on the Amazon Web Services cloud\n20. Information about samples and study design were also uploaded. The available samples were put into groups based on relevant study variables and genes were ranked according to the different groups comparisons. A detailed description of the GXB software tool is available from recent publications\n19\u2013\n21. This software interface allows user to easily navigate and filter the dataset collection. A web tutorial can be easily\naccessed online. Annotation and functionality of the web software interface were described previously by our group\n18,\n19,\n21, and is reproduced here so that readers can use this article as a standalone resource. Briefly, datasets of interest can be quickly identified either by filtering on criteria from pre-defined sections on the left or by entering a query term in the search box at the top of the dataset navigation page. Clicking on one of the studies listed in the dataset navigation page opens a viewer designed to provide interactive browsing and graphic representations of large-scale data in an interpretable format. This interface is designed to present ranked gene lists and display expression results graphically in a context-rich environment. Selecting a gene from the rank ordered list on the left of the data-viewing interface will display its expression values graphically in the screen\u2019s central panel. Directly above the graphical display drop down menus give users the ability: a) To change how the gene list is ranked - this allows the user to change the method used to rank the genes, or to only include genes that are selected for specific biological interest; b) To change sample grouping (Group Set button) - in some datasets, a user can switch between groups based on cell type to groups based on disease type, for example; c) To sort individual samples within a group based on associated categorical or continuous variables (e.g. gender or age); d) To toggle between the bar chart view and a box plot view, with expression values represented as a single point for each sample. Samples are split into the same groups whether displayed as a bar chart or box plot; e) To provide a color legend for the sample groups; f) To select categorical information that is to be overlaid at the bottom of the graph - for example, the user can display gender or smoking status in this manner; g) To provide a color legend for the categorical information overlaid at the bottom of the graph; h) To download the graph as a portable network graphics (png) image. Measurements have no intrinsic utility in absence of contextual information. It is this contextual information that makes the results of a study or experiment interpretable. It is therefore important to capture, integrate and display information that will give users the ability to interpret data and gain new insights from it. We have organized this information under different tabs directly above the graphical display. The tabs can be hidden to make more room for displaying the data plots, or revealed by clicking on the blue \u201cshow info panel\u201d button on the top right corner of the display. Information about the gene selected from the list on the left side of the display is available under the \u201cGene\u201d tab. Information about the study is available under the \u201cStudy\u201d tab. Rolling the mouse cursor over a bar chart feature while displaying the \u201cSample\u201d tab lists any clinical, demographic, or laboratory information available for the selected sample. Finally, the \u201cDownloads\u201d tab allows advanced users to retrieve the original dataset for analysis outside this tool. It also provides all available sample annotation data for use alongside the expression data in third party analysis software. Other functionalities are provided under the \u201cTools\u201d drop-down menu located in the top right corner of the user interface. Some of the notable functionalities available through this menu include: a) Annotations, which provides access to all the ancillary information about the study, samples and dataset organized across different tabs; b) Cross-project view; which provides the ability for a given gene to browse through all available studies; c) Copy link, which generates a mini-URL encapsulating information about the display settings in use and that can be saved and shared with others (clicking on the envelope icon on the toolbar inserts the URL in an email message via the local email client); d) Chart options; which gives user the option to customize chart labels.",
