By testing samples from foals naturally infected with rotavirus in central Kentucky, it was determined that serotype 3 is predominant; this has also been confirmed by studies on foals in Ireland and Britain.8 Molecular studies have defined subgroups of serotype 3 rotaviruses.6., 7. Two new rotavirus serotypes, 13 and 14, have been identified, but more research needs to be undertaken to determine the prevalence of these rotaviruses as well as isolates that are currently untypable.32\n",

It is theorized that adult animals may periodically shed rotavirus into the environment. Because the virus may persist in the environment for as long as 9 months,37 a buildup of contamination occurs, especially when poor disinfection practices exist during the foaling season. Eventually, foals are exposed to a dose of virus that exceeds the level of protective local and systemic immunity, causing varying degrees of diarrhea. Also, many outbreaks have occurred after a mare and foal have shipped onto the farm and been immediately introduced into the resident herd without a period of quarantine. The foal, incubating the disease, breaks with diarrhea and begins an outbreak on the farm of immunologically naive foals. Rotaviruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, with foals ingesting feed or licking surfaces contaminated with the virus. During an incubation time of 18 to 24 hours, the virus infiltrates the epithelium of the villus tips of the duodenum and jejunum.14 The loss of these functional absorptive cells results in maldigestion and malabsorption, causing diarrhea of varying severity. Because the intestinal crypt cells are not affected and continue to replicate to replace these absorptive cells, most cases are self-limiting. Although the very contagious nature of the disease may cause high morbidity, with proper treatment, the disease has low mortality. Foals may become infected with the virus but be subclinical shedders during farm outbreaks, thereby further contaminating the environment with virus.19\n",

Animals from 2 days to 6 months of age may be affected with any of the following signs: watery to a pasty semi-solid diarrhea (nonhemorrhagic, ranging in color from bright yellow to greyish green), anorexia, depression, and dehydration.4., 19. Diminished or absent nursing is often the first clinical sign noticed by farm personnel. Fever is not a consistent sign, and although there is a characteristic odor of rotaviral diarrhea, absence of this smell does not discount rotavirus as a diagnosis. Foals that recover shed the virus in feces for an average of 3 days after becoming clinically normal but usually do not experience recurrent rotavirus infections. Morbidity can be over 70% on breeding farms, but mortality is low: one study reported that of 196 sick foals, one 2-day-old foal died from rotavirus-associated diarrhea and dehydration, and one older foal developed rotavirus diarrhea and acute gastric ulceration symptoms and eventually was euthanatized after several months.19 During a rotavirus outbreak that involved 82 of 164 Standardbred foals, none died from rotavirus diarrhea, although one foal did die from acute gastric perforation and peritonitis.4 Foals younger than 2 weeks of age and those having symptoms of gastric ulcer disease are at higher risk of mortality.

The tender skin under the tail and between the hind legs can scald and peel from encrusted diarrheic feces and urine. Hair can be lost from the tail and skin in improperly managed animals. To prevent this from occurring, mineral oil or petroleum jelly can be liberally applied to the tail and the skin between the hind legs to form a physical barrier to the scalding effects of feces. For foals that already have skin irritation, the skin and tail should be thoroughly and gently cleaned with a mild soap. Desitin Ointment (Leeming Division, Pfizer Inc, Parsippany, NJ), commonly used for diaper rash, is an effective treatment for scalded skin in foals. Besides providing a physical barrier to irritants, the zinc oxide relieves the burning, irritation, and inflammation of skin.

The product V-Tergent 8X (Pitman-Moore, Inc, Mundelein, IL) is a detergent that easily liquefies and removes greasy substances and can be used to remove the ointment residue in the stall as well as on skin.",

Even when effective prophylactic products are developed, farm management practices, including quarantine, disinfection, and hygiene, will always need to be in force to prevent any contagious disease outbreak.",
