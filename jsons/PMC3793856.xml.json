Comparative biology is routinely used on a case by case basis to assess the threat to public health posed by newly discovered pathogens \u2013 Schmallenberg virus being a recent example. Here we aspire to a more systematic approach to answering the question \u2018which kinds of viruses should we be most worried about?\u2019",

Whilst having a number of limitations (discussed elsewhere4), the use of virus species as our unit of study is a natural starting point. Our procedure reveals a total of 158 human infective RNA virus species from 47 genera and 17 families (with one genus unassigned to a family).",

There is a total of 52 species (including some zoonotic species, e.g. influenza A) in this category. Other viruses always have R\n0 less than 1. Some of these are transmissible between humans but not sufficiently so that they can cause major epidemics and/or persist endemically; they are restricted to self-limiting outbreaks. We estimate that there are 28 species of this kind. The remainder \u2013 comprising almost half the total of human RNA virus species \u2013 is not known to be transmissible between humans at all. This generally reflects their inability to replicate in tissues that permit release from the body (notably the upper respiratory tract, lower gastro-intestinal tract, urogenital tract or possibly blood).",

Reflecting this, several important virus taxa \u2013 including the retro-, rota- and corona viruses \u2013 were known as animal pathogens before they were found in humans and, at least initially, there was greater knowledge of them in the veterinary community than the medical community. Second, we cannot hope to understand the characteristics that make some viruses serious threats to public health if we do not also study those that are not.
