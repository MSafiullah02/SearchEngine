They were put at risk not only by the nature of their work, but also by a shortage of individual protection devices and government procrastination on testing programs. Widespread testing was delayed for weeks, while the virus SARS-Cov-2 managed to spread around the country and across hospitals undetected.",

Even when precautions were taken, SARS-Cov-2 found its way into healthcare facilities. This is how the pandemic has impacted me as a doctor, causing stress, fatigue, new uncertainties, and the need to re-organize my whole work and life priorities. People call us heroes, but, because of the lack of evidence-proven treatments, we doubt the effectiveness of our work and we don't feel like heroes. Meanwhile, we need and wish to stay safe while keeping the hospital SARS-CoV-2 free. Rather than heroes we look like prey in heroes' capes. That kind of bravery, that work integrity, is not boundless. No one is so fearless or short-sighted as to discount all risks.",

This is our darkest hour. Too many among us are mourning their loved ones, those who have left their families abruptly and often without the chance of a last encounter. Funerals are banned and too many deceased are now front-page news, fodder for Twitter or Facebook pages: they are our grandparents, our fathers, our teachers, our cardiology professors.",
