We exploit this state-level variation to estimate what could be achieved in terms of child poverty if all states adopted the most generous or inclusive states' policies. Specifically, we simulate the child poverty reductions that would occur if every state were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in four key policies: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and state Child Tax Credits (CTC). We find that adopting the most generous or inclusive state EITC policy would have the largest impact on child poverty, reducing it by 1.2 percentage points, followed by SNAP, TANF, and lastly state CTC. If all states were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in all four policies, the child poverty rate would decrease by 2.5 percentage points, and five and a half million children would be lifted out of poverty.",

That is the piece of the child poverty puzzle we aim to address here. We ask: If all states offered the most generous or inclusive support to children and their families seen in other states in the four largest income assistance programs, what would the child poverty rate be? To answer this question, we simulate the child poverty reductions that would occur if all states were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in four key policies: SNAP, state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC), TANF, and state Child Tax Credits (CTC). In effect, we explore how much child poverty reduction can be wrung out of the most generous or inclusive states' anti-poverty policies.",

While some of this variation is due to differences in demographics, costs of living, and state and local economies, the state policies that affect the total resources available to low-income families with children are also an important source of inequality across states. Though the four largest cash-and credit-based income supplementation programs we examine here -TANF, SNAP, EITC and CTCwere enacted at the federal level to bring relief and stability to the lowestearning families, states have a great deal of autonomy in determining the underlying set of policies that govern their implementation. More restrictive states have enacted policies that reduce benefit size and/or inhibit enrollment by reducing eligibility thresholds or by making the application and recertification process more difficult. Conversely, more generous or inclusive states ensure that the benefits are accessible to a larger portion of the eligible population and that they are relatively easy to access.",

First, each provides a cash or near-cash transfer that directly affects the household budgets for families with children. In other words, these programs are intended to impact both short-term income and long-term wealth accumulation. Though these policies inarguably fail to address the root causes of child poverty (i.e. structural barriers, discrimination, access to education, etc.), cash or near-cash transfers have demonstrated effectiveness both domestically and abroad in their causal impact on poverty, income stability, health and well-being (Baird, McIntosh, & \u00d6zler, 2011; Banerjee, Hanna, Kreindler, & Olken, 2017; Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016; Muennig, Mohit, Wu, Jia, & Rosen, 2016) . Second, three out of four programs are closely aligned with the principle that poor families should have the autonomy to make their own spending decisions, a program feature that is repeatedly linked to cumulative impacts, with the exception of SNAP that is limited to food purchases (Edin & Shaefer, 2015; Hammond & Orr, 2016; Muennig et al., 2016) . Third, as a large body of literature has demonstrated that adulthood inequalities manifest in childhood, essential to our policy choices is cash or near-cash availability in childhood (Almond & Currie, 2011; Almond et al., 2017) .",

Though do not simulate direct benefit receipt among foreign-born from coverage/enrollment (inclusiveness), the former is also a function of cost of living and demographic distribution of the population (e.g. family size). The latter is more heavily dependent on state policy choices, such as eligibility criteria, and funding allocation preferences, such as that for cash income support. As the efficacy of benefit levels wholly depends upon enrollment, we modeled changes in TANF and SNAP enrollment alone conditional upon benefit levels remaining the same to ensure that our results are driven by factors that states can plausibly leverage, rather than those outside of their realm of control. This choice simplifies interpretation of our resultsif we were to simulate changes in both benefit level and enrollment, interpretation of the overall program effect would be less clear, as the resulting effect would mask the competing effects of changing benefit level and enrollment.

Even if a state decides not to adopt the policy parameters we use here, an attainable target might help legislators compare one policy against another using a realistic threshold. Second, states can use these targets to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of their current set of the policies that guide these four anti-poverty programs. Poorperforming states might find that their cost-per-person is high, while their benefit structure results in less-generous or inclusive benefits, shedding light on new opportunities to optimize the poverty-related benefits of their spending.",

            "text": "The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) replaced AFDCthe primary cash assistance program for low-income families at the timewith Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). AFDC was jointly financed through federal and state governments, with the federal government providing up to 80% of the costs the states incurred. In contrast, TANF provides states with a fixed block grant allowing savings or extra costs to accrue to the states. Further, PRWORA mandated states to include much stronger work requirements for cash assistance and to restrict benefits to a lifetime maximum of five years. In addition, states were given greater leeway over the administration of their cash public assistance program in terms of benefit amount, time limits, work requirements, and eligibility (Blank, 2002; Garfinkel, Rainwater, & Smeeding, 2010) . Some argued that under the new regime, states were encouraged to begin a \"race to the bottom\" (Figlio, Kolpin, & Reid, 1999; Saavedra, 1999) As a result of welfare reform granting states latitude in administering welfare benefits (Moffitt, Phelan, and, Winkler, 2015) , state-level TANF programs diversified considerably more than under previous administrations. States can now discourage participation by increasing the frequency of recertification requirements and/or requiring fingerprinting, or encourage participation through online applications and automatic eligibility for other low-income assistance programs, formally referred to Broad Based Categorical Eligibility (USDA Economic Research Service, 2016). Using California's CalWORKs (the state's version of TANF) eligibility criteria as a common metric, states ranged from covering about 5% of their TANF-eligible population in Georgia to just over 40% in Maine between 2010 and 2012. 4 Despite the fact that TANF policies are broadly guided by federal policy, the generosity and resulting inclusiveness of these individual policy choices reflects voter preference.",

            "text": "For instance, one study examined the variation in TANF policies and benefits among five US states, finding that states who were committed to bolstering the safety net for children, such as California, reflected this mission in their eligibility rules, absence of a time limit, and relatively large cash benefit amounts. Conversely, Texas aimed to make TANF a 'last resort,' pushing for employment support over cash assistance with relatively small payments (Hahn, Golden, & Stanczyk, 2012) . Further, states can spend TANF funds on a range of cash and in-kind benefits to address budget shortfalls in other areas of state responsibility. For instance, if a state failed to win a Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) demonstration waiver in a given year, they may decide to allocate a larger portion of TANF funding to fill a gap in child care services as opposed to increasing the availability or generosity of cash benefits. Though these funds would largely affect the same population, that they're earmarked differently may have different policy implications. As up to 30 percent of TANF funds can be allocated to CCDBG and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) combined, this may account for a large portion of variation in TANF welfare benefit generosity and access (Ziliak, 2015) . To put this in perspective, 35 states spent less than quarter of their TANF funds on cash assistance in 2014the remainder was spent on child care, work support, child welfare, and other social services such as pre-kindergarten programs, family formation support, etc. (Bitler & Hoynes, 2016b ). Yet, for a state in an economic downturn with relatively scarce employment opportunities, childcare and workforce development spending may be less beneficial than cash assistance and ultimately, fail to affect poverty at the same rate as the cash benefit structure under AFDC. Along with the fact that TANF is non-responsive to business cycle fluctuations, 5 it is not surprising that its anti-poverty effectiveness has been outpaced by EITC and SNAP.",

            "text": "Welfare reform encompassed more than just the transition from AFDC to TANF. In an effort to \"make work pay\", states played an increasingly important role in the design of tax credit programs. State versions of the EITC currently exist in just over half of the US states with state income taxes, with tremendous variation in their structure and generosity. 6 Wisconsin was the first to enact a state supplement to the federal EITC in 1983 (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2016a). Today, 29 states have a state supplement to the EITC, 23 of which are fully refundable. States continue to expand and reform their credits by increasing the size of the benefit relative to the federal EITC, changing the refundable status, and changing the income eligibility definition. Not all of these reforms are to the benefit of the worker. For example, in 2017 Connecticut reduced its credit from 27.5 percent of the federal EITC to 23 percent, and Oklahoma and Michigan recently reduced their credits by 70 percent (Williams & Waxman, 2018) . As state and local taxes tend to disproportionately burden low-income workers, state EITCs can be crucial for achieving a more equitable tax system (Williams & Waxman, 2018) . The percent of the federal EITC provided by states ranges from 3.5% in Louisiana to 40% in Washington DC in 2012 (Appendix 1).",

Reluctance to interact with government agencies is a plausible barrier to uptake among immigrants, as is confusion surrounding eligibility (Van Hook, 2003) . See Dean, 2016 for a thorough discussion. make a more concerted effort to enroll eligible residents, resulting in improved coverage under similar eligibility scenarios, whereas other states might take advantage of policy flexibilities in order to cover budget shortfalls or other gaps in funding.

For these reasons, we use augmented CPS ASEC data with TRIM-adjusted revisions and corrections to the benefit amounts received from SNAP, Supplemental Security Income, and TANF. The CPS ASEC is the source for official poverty and labor market statistics, and provides a large and nationally representative sample of children. We use the 2010-2012 CPS ASEC (survey years 2009 -2011) as these are the most recent years for which TRIM data were available at the time of this writing. While a number of states have adopted more generous policies since then (California, for example, created a state EITC in 2015), the benefits of more accurate adjustments for under-reporting outweigh any advantages of using a more recent time period in which the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and other social policy expansions took place.",

In addition to the resources that SPM units have at their disposal and the SPM poverty thresholds that apply to their geographic location, we use a variety of demographic variables in the subgroup analyses. As undocumented immigrants are ineligible for benefits and legal immigrants face a waiting period, we exclude foreignborn non-citizens from either Mexico or Central America from benefit receipt in our simulations, as this definition captures the demographic characteristics of the majority of undocumented immigrants in the United States (Gelatt & Zong, 2018) .Although this implicitly assumes that recipients cannot trade or barter benefits or acquire them in some other way, without information on undocumented immigration in the survey, this is the most conservative estimate given the limitations in CPS ASEC data. That being said, we are likely misclassifying a number of individuals as undocumented who are in fact documented, thus not allocating simulated benefits to those who are eligible.

In each case, we simulate the reduction in child poverty-in each state and the nation as a wholein these four scenarios in which all states are brought up to the policy generosity level of the most generous or inclusive state. Though generosity can be conceived and operationalized in multiple ways, we chose to measure generosity here as both benefit amount (generosity) and the enrollment rate among eligible individuals (inclusiveness), as we describe in depth below. For TANF and SNAP, we do not simulate the reduction in child poverty if all states had the same benefit amount, rather, we model changes in the proportion of eligible individuals receiving benefits, or program inclusiveness, for two reasons. First, many states with a higher cost of living -Hawaii, California, and Alaskahave higher benefit amounts. While it is reasonable to expect that states might provide benefits to the same share of their eligible populations, it may not be reasonable to expect them to offer the same benefit amount given the differences in their cost of living. Second, in the case of TANF, the federal government endows states the autonomy to allocate funding according to their preferences, ranging from cash income support to workforce development and childcare for higher-earning families. Accordingly, in the effort to simulate plausible state choices rather than immovable factors, we focus on program inclusiveness alone for TANF and SNAP simulations.

Data on benefits received in the form of cash income are only available annually. An alternative measure of generosity for both TANF and SNAP might be the size of the benefit payment.

If this is the case, allocating funds to these anti-poverty programs may be infeasible without offsetting other lines in the budget. Alternatively, if there is no relationship between poverty rates and generosity or inclusiveness, states may be allocating funds away from child poverty investments as a matter of choice, rather than necessity, implying that states have some flexibility in prioritizing child well-being. It is of course worth mentioning that state revenue and capacity is subject to states' choices not just about resource allocation but about how much state tax revenue they bring in in the first place.

First, we do not model any behavioral, employment, or labor market changes that might result from the receipt of additional benefits. Though potential behavioral effects such as labor market participation and effort should not be ignored, there is some evidence that these combined behavioral effects are relatively small (Ben-Shalom et al., 2011) and in the case of the EITC (and by extension, likely the CTC) behavioral effects would lead to greater labor force participation, implying that the anti-poverty effects we estimate may be understated (Hoynes & Patel, 2015 That said, this period may be particularly relevant to the current state of the economy on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, evidence drawn from expansions during our period of inquiry may better inform economic recovery than the period immediately before COVID-19 due to similar macroeconomic conditions. Future researchers should consider using more recent data, reflecting a longer post-recession recovery period, conditional upon the accuracy of correcting for underreporting. Though outside the scope of the present paper, more recent innovations in dealing with underreporting should be considered as well. For example, the author of a recent paper compared statistical methods for correcting underreporting for SNAP using linked administrative data (Mittag, 2019) , finding that adjustments on the tails of the income distribution are by far the most meaningful. Third, our SNAP and TANF simulations exclude undocumented individuals, for whom poverty among children may have been more significantly affected. Similarly, these individuals are included in the EITC and CTC simulations at the risk of overascertaining the effects of these programs (as parental SSNs are required for tax credit eligibility). This important limitation should be addressed in future research, particularly on account of a more recent policy shift allowing child-only SSN eligibility (Duncan & Le Menestrel, 2019) . Fourth, as the focus of this study is on cash and near-cash benefits, we do not simulate the effects of scaling up other anti-poverty policies in the present study. As many of these policies convey benefits beyond their monetary value to enrollees, the presumed benefit extends beyond poverty relief into other benefits to health and well-being. Though outside the scope of the present study, a related study presents the results of a similar exercise assigning Medicaid benefits to non-beneficiaries in nonexpansion states (Zewde & Wimer, 2019) . Future research should consider the merit of a similar approach in consideration of the other policies. At the same time, that the policies we examine here fail to address the root causes of child poverty should not be ignored.",

The equivalent numbers are 816,558 for the CTC simulation, 985,776 for the TANF simulation, and 1,340,499 for the SNAP simulation.

However, there is somewhat of a tension between reducing poverty and increasing resources-to-needs, as expanding SNAP would produce the greatest increase in poor children's resources to needs. Finally, it should be noted that the reforms we model are relatively modestdesigned not as ideal policies but rather as examples of the effects of expanding policies already in existence. We illustrate that changes to current policiesbased on what other states have deemed feasible and appropriatecan have a range of (including somewhat large) effects on child poverty. For example, in the case of TANF, some states saw no change in child poverty (see e.g. Appendix Table 4 ). Of course, more ambitious reforms, such as a minimum benefit, could have even larger effectsa topic we hope to address in future research. While this paper simulated the effects of four major anti-poverty policies, there are many other policies that affect the economic wellbeing of low-income families. We encourage researchers to apply similar simulation methodology to other policy areas in order to quantify and prioritize areas in which strengthening public policy would produce the greatest increase in public wellbeing.",

Reducing Poverty among Children: Evidence from State Policy Simulations Abstract State approaches to reducing child poverty vary considerably. We exploit this state-level variation to estimate what could be achieved in terms of child poverty if all states adopted the most generous or inclusive states' policies. Specifically, we simulate the child poverty reductions that would occur if every state were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in four key policies: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and state Child Tax Credits (CTC)",

Like most household surveys, the CPS suffers from under-reporting of benefits. For example, the authors of one study (B D Meyer, Mok, & Sullivan, 2009) conducted a comprehensive analysis of under-reporting problems of ten government transfer programs in five nationally-representative public surveys. They reported that only sixty percent of SNAP dollars are correctly reported in the CPS ASEC; the under-reporting rates of TANF have increased since 2000 and the correct report rates were on average, lower than 70 percent.",

The resources-to-us to unpack the way in which the simulations function in more detail, unveiling who receives benefits, the amount they receive, and how these features affect our overall results.Figure 3summarizes the percentage point increase in the resources-toneeds ratio produced by each of the program simulations. Since the program simulations are expected to primarily impact the poor (and to a lesser extent, the near-poor), we categorize children in the graphs of the resources-to-needs ratio by whether their SPM unit resources are below 100% of the poverty line (i.e. the poor), 100-200% of the poverty line, and above 200% of the poverty line. While we attempted to investigate the impact of an increase in benefit generosity/inclusiveness on children in deep poverty (<50% of the poverty threshold), we found that sample sizes within states were too small to reliably estimate the simulation models for this subsample. Further, as TRIM adjustments for underreporting are remarkably less reliable among very low-income families, the inclusion of deep SPM poverty would require additional underreporting adjustments, as detailed inMittag (2019).Overall, the largest impact of the state anti-poverty policy simulations is on the resourcesto-needs ratio of the poor. For children below 100% of the poverty line, the SNAP inclusiveness simulation results in the largest increase in children's resources-to-needs. In the sample between 100-200% of the poverty line, the state EITC generosity simulation results in the largest increase in the resources-to-needs ratio, and in the sample above 200% of the poverty line, the state CTC results in the largest increase in children's",

This tax calculator simulates the amount of Federal EITC individuals are estimated to have received based on their earned income, the rules governing eligibility, etc. While the calculator provides total state taxes paid and received after all credits, it provides no direct information on the amount that individuals receive in state EITC, though this would only produce erroneous estimates among those who file federal tax returns but not state tax returns, an expectedly small fraction of the tax-filing population. Therefore, we compute this quantity by multiplying the amount an individual received in federal EITC Maine, and Virginia), the computation is slightly more difficult because taxpayers may receive a state EITC amount only up to the amount of taxes they owe; the credit is not distributed as part of a refund. In order to estimate individuals' state EITC in these three states, we first multiply their federal EITC amount by their state EITC rate as before but cap the amount they receive in state EITC at their estimated taxes owed after other credits have been taken into account. This ensures that we do not overestimate the state EITC amounts that respondents receive in states with non-refundable EITC.families in our simulations. The final step is to remove from resources the actual state EITC that individuals were estimated to have received (as described above) and replace it with 43% of their federal EITC. We then re-estimate the poverty rate and compute the reduction in poverty due to the simulated expansion of the EITC.In the EITC simulation, 23.3% of people receiving a state EITC are below the SPM poverty line. Nearly half of people receiving the simulated state EITC have two adults in the home; 19.0% have one adult and 29.4% have two or more adults. About 32% of simulated state EITC recipients have one child in the SPM unit; 34.8% have 2 children and another 33.6% have 3 or more children. There are two other states with a CTC during 2010-2012: Oklahoma and North Carolina. Oklahoma allows residents to claim either 5% of their Federal Child Tax Credit or 20% of their Federal Child and Dependent Care Credit, whichever is greater. We estimate Oklahoma's CTC as 5% of the combined Child Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit (the refundable portion of the credit); there is no information in the CPS ASEC on the Federal Child and Dependent Care Credit. In North Carolina, there are income eligibility cutoffs for tax filers with dependent children under 17. Individuals with incomes below the threshold receive $100 per child in credits.

For a detailed discussion of the labor market responses and other behavioral effects of these programs, see e.g. Ben-Shalom,Moffitt, & Scholz (2011) andDuncan &   Le Menestrel (2019). Future empirical studies should attempt to model the aggregate impact and magnitude of such aggregate behavioral impacts across programs. The second limitation to our analysis is that we do not model the effect of imposing new state taxes that would be required to finance increases in benefits. Different financing methods could somewhat alter the distributional impacts of proposed reforms, though unless such financing were significantly regressive in nature, they are unlikely to affect the overall effects on poverty found here. On a related note, we harness data from2009-2011   (survey years 2010 -2012)  as these more accurately reflect actual tax obligations and underreporting adjustments under TRIM3. What we gain in precision, however, may be lost in generalizability as this period may reflect atypical state policy variation on account of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and post-recession recovery.",
