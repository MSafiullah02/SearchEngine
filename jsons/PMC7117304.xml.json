            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration followed by high mortality in suckling piglets (Huang et al., 2013). The causative agent, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), was initially identified in Europe in 1978, and its genome (\u02dc28 kb in size) consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs) (Kocherhans et al., 2001). The 5\u2019 two-thirds of PEDV genome encodes ORF1 (consisting of overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b), and the 3\u2019 one-third harbors ORFs encoding four structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and an accessory ORF3 between S and E (Huang et al., 2013; Kocherhans et al., 2001; Tian et al., 2014). RNA synthesis in PEDV is carried out by a replicase-transcriptase composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b. Among them, Nsp3 comprises multiple structural domains, including a highly acidic domain at the amino terminus (Ac), and a highly conserved ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase (ADRP) macrodomain. The Ac domain of Nsp3 is essential for virion assembly and plays a critical role in interaction with the viral nucleocapsid during early infection, whereas the ADRP provides activities necessary for synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs (Hurst-Hess et al., 2015). As pigs of all ages are susceptible to PEDV (Alvarez et al., 2015; Annamalai et al., 2015), there is an urgent need for the development of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays for use in the field (Diel et al., 2016).",

Another common diagnostic method is serological testing for the presence of specific antibodies against viral proteins, which is also fast and convenient for epidemiologic investigations. Many tools have been developed for the detection of anti-PEDV antibodies based upon the major structural proteins (such as S, M or N proteins) in serum, colostrum, milk, feces and oral fluid, including indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA), virus neutralization assays (SN), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) (Diel et al., 2016; Gerber et al., 2014; Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015; Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017; Okda et al., 2015). But comparative studies of the above assays using different PEDV structural and nonstructural proteins as antigens are rarely conducted. Meanwhile, the diagnostic potentials of specific PEDV accessory and nonstructural proteins, if any, have not yet been investigated in details.",

Previously, the virions of several coronaviruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), turkey and bovine enteric coronaviruses have been observed with a diameter ranging between 60\u2013220 nm (Dea and Garzon, 1991). To our knowledge, the pleomorphic property of PEDV virions containing not only the small or defective particles, but also the giant spherical particles ranging up to 350 nm in diameter, is reported here for the first time. Although a few of the PEDV particles had lost partial spikes, they were relatively intact. As spike glycoproteins are known to be the most immunogenic proteins of coronaviruses (Chen et al., 2016), purification by ultracentrifugation through sucrose cushions in this study proved to be reliable. Also, the level of PEDV protein was relatively high as detected by BCA protein kits, thus confirming that the quality, integrity and quantity of the purified virions were sufficient for use as the antigen in subsequent ELISA assays.",

In this study, in order to determine the pattern of antibody response of weaning piglets in a 17-day weaning period after PEDV infection, serum or fecal samples from experimentally-infected 3-day-old piglets were examined by ELISA based on the PEDV WV or the S1 protein, and by serum neutralization test (Fig. 3\n). The results indicated that IgG and IgA responses against both antigens were detected in serum at different time points after PEDV infection (Fig. 3A and B). Despite challenge with PEDV in these piglets, levels of serum IgG and IgA decreased from 1 dpi, reaching a minimum after 7 dpi as detected by both WV and S1 antigens (Fig. 3A, B), and the pattern or trend of neutralizing antibody (NA) was more similar to that of IgA (Fig. 3C). A good linear relationship between the S1-based IgA ELISA titers and NA titers was observed (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient of 0.98; p < 0.001), demonstrating the correlation between them (Fig. 3D). There were some differences in the sensitivity of the antigens to detect antibodies, as levels of serum IgA were slightly higher when the S1 protein was used as the detection antigen. Levels of fecal IgA were also highest before challenge (0 dpi), and continuously declined after challenge (Fig. 3E). The specificity and sensitivity of detection of S1 and WV antigens were similar for serum IgA. The high IgG and IgA antibodies and NA detected at the early stages of the weaning piglets are presumably maternal antibodies received from sows that were not PEDV negative. In addition, piglets during weaning have not developed their own immunity to the virus. These results also demonstrated that the S1-based ELISA is an alternative (to WV-based) and ideal serological assay for detection of anti-PEDV antibodies.",

Overall, the levels of antibodies against PEDV WV and the three proteins antigens were generally higher in primiparous and multiparous sows than those in 3\u20135 weeks-old pigs (p < 0.01). The trend of serum IgG response to each PEDV antigen from the 1-week-old to the 3-week-old pigs was similar to that of the experimentally-infected weaning piglets (Fig. 3A). Antibodies were highest in the 1 week-old piglets (p < 0.01) except for WV antigen, and then declined to a minimum by 5 weeks-of-age significantly (p < 0.01) before increasing again to a relatively stable level from 7 to 20 weeks-of-age (Fig. 5B,C; p < 0.01). This pattern was in agreement with a recent report about the prevalence of PEDV antibodies in swine farms (Bertasio et al., 2016), which might reflect that newborn piglets receive maternal IgG antibodies from sows, though the level of the antibodies decline quickly, and the weaned piglets must begin to develop their own immunity to PEDV.",

PEDV herd-infection status is very important for biosecurity and the control of PED. Compared to RT-PCR and other nuclei acid detection assays, serological tests are advantageous to study immune responses related to vaccination, wild-type virus infection, and to determine whether sow immunity is adequate in individual litters after PEDV exposure (Diel et al., 2016). PEDV infection is not always obvious in finishing pigs, which increases the risk of widespread disease in pigs of all ages (Bertasio et al., 2016). Thus, sensitive serological tests would allow detection of recent infections, to avoid the introduction of these animals into na\u00efve herds. However, there are many different structural and non-structural proteins to choose from when selecting an antigen to use in novel diagnostic assays. Previously, we have developed and validated indirect ELISA based on the S1 protein to detect anti-PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies in postweaning pigs (Gerber et al., 2014). The present study was set up to investigate diagnostic potentials of specific PEDV accessory and nonstructural proteins, which have not yet been reported systematically.",

Additionally, levels of NA were more closely correlated with IgA than IgG (Fig. 3B-D), as seen in other studies (Paudel et al., 2014). Abundant anti-PEDV NA have been demonstrated in colostrum on the day of birth, decreasing rapidly in milk by day 3, and gradually declining further from days 3\u201319 post-farrowing, which may contribute to variable protective capacity (Song et al., 2016). The current study showed a similar decline, further confirming the reliability of the S1-based ELISA assays applicable to weaning pigs in addition to postweaning pigs (Gerber et al., 2014; Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015), and also highlighting the importance of accurate diagnosis in a short window for proper immunization of sows and piglets.",

It is worth noting that the recombinant S1 protein was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and should display a natural conformation with high glycosylation, as shown in Fig. 1D, which may be one reason for its higher detection sensitivity. On the other hand, WV was mainly purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, differential centrifugation or polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (Hoffmann and Robert, 1990). These methods would damage the integrity of the virus, especially the surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, the eukaryotic-expressed S1 protein is likely more advantageous than the WV as the antigen for PEDV serological assays. For another two major structural proteins M and N, due to common epitopes shared by PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV, several studies have previously demonstrated that PEDV M or N presented some cross-reactivity to TGEV or PDCoV (Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2016). In contrast, recombinant PEDV-S1 had no cross-reactivity with sera from these porcine coronaviruses, showing the best diagnostic sensitivity (Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017).

The small structural E protein has important roles in the assembly of coronavirus virions, virus egress and in the host stress response (Ruch and Machamer, 2012). Besides the structural proteins, PEDV has several non-structural proteins (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp3, among others) that express in the early stage of virus infection and have important functions in the viral replication cycle. The coronavirus Nsp3 is a conserved component of the viral protein processing machinery, and may be incorporated in the virion viaits intimate association with viral RNA (Neuman et al., 2008). The Nsp3 is known as the largest replicase subunit, consisting of numerous distinct structural domains separated by disordered linkers. Some of these, such as the Ac and ADRP (macrodomain), are well conserved across all genera of coronaviruses, though there have been no reports about serological assays based on PEDV Ac and ADRP domains. Considering their potential use in the study of host immune response, these proteins were specifically included in the current study.",

Subsequently, they were used individually as detection antigens in western blot and/or indirect ELISAs to detect anti-PEDV IgG antibodies in sera from diarrheic pigs (Fig. 5). The PEDV WV and the recombinant S1 expressed from mammalian cells was used for comparison. The S1, ORF3C, and E peptides each reacted strongly with the sera, reflecting expected distributions of PEDV-specific antibodies. The reactivity of Ac, ADRP, Nsp1 and Nsp2 peptides was less pronounced (data not shown), thus they were discarded from consideration as novel diagnostic antigens. The generally high level of IgG against S1, ORF3C, and E proteins in old-age pigs was consistent with recent reports that anti-PEDV IgG in infected pigs persisted for over than 17 weeks after the onset of diarrhea symptoms (Lin et al., 2016). All antibody levels declined to their lowest levels at 3 weeks-of-age, which was consistent with the result from experimentally-infected piglets at weaning (Fig. 3). Western blot was implemented to confirm the ELISAs, with additional \u201cfuzzy\u201d bands appeared when the ORF3C, Ac and E were used as detection antigens, indicating non-specific recognition (Fig. 4). This may be related to differences in antigens used and/or the sensitivity of the assays for detecting anti-PEDV antibodies.",

The accessory protein E showed intermediate sensitivity in western blot and extremely high sensitivity in ELISA assays compared with the other antigens (Fig. 4C and 5 D). The ELISA sensitivity was too strong, as nearly all of the sera from sows and 0\u20131 week-old piglets were strongly positive, thus it could not properly reflect the trend of PEDV-specific antibodies.
