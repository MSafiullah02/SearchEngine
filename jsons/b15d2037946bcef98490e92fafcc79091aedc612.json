These two groups of patients differ significantly in terms of mean age, prior comorbidity, and degree of extra-hepatic organ dysfunction, requiring substantially different approaches to supportive care. Common aspects of care are those directed at the transplanted organ itself, with regard to monitoring and recognition of early dysfunction, initiation of immunosuppression, and management of surgical complications. Close liaison with the multidisciplinary team, which will include the intensivist, transplant surgeon, transplant hepatologist, anesthesiologist, and radiologist, is required.",

Lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy (including disseminated intravascular coagulation), and sepsis also represent particular problems. Preoperative optimization will usually require invasive cardiovascular monitoring, fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT), platelet/coagulation support, cerebral monitoring in grade 3 or 4 coma, and in some cases, intracranial pressure monitoring. The decision to commence intracranial pressure monitoring will be taken on an individual basis depending on the degree of clinical suspicion that raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is present or evolving. Factors favoring this decision are young age, markedly raised arterial ammonia (>150 mmol/L), neurological signs such as clonus, pupillary hyporesponsiveness, or dilatation, and the combination of hypertension and bradycardia. A recent analysis of 58 patients in whom intracranial monitoring was undertaken reported radiological evidence of intracranial bleeding in 10%. In two cases, bleeding was felt to have contributed to the patients' deaths. 4 Measures to reduce the risk of raised ICP, and to treat it once suspected, are summarized in ",

            "text": "The method of organ implantation may have significant consequences in terms of posttransplant care. The conventional method involves removal of the native liver together with a short section of the inferior vena cava (IVC) above and below the organ, followed by implantation of the equivalent anatomy (\"caval interposition\") from the donor (Fig. 53.1) . The \"piggyback\" method, in which a cuff of the donor's IVC with the donor liver draining into it through the three hepatic veins is piggybacked onto the recipient's IVC, avoids cross clamping and transection of the recipient's IVC. \"Split liver\" grafts are used when it is felt that the donor organ is of sufficient size to provide liver tissue to two patients. The lobe is implanted conventionally; however, a cut surface remains that may bleed or leak bile ( Fig. 53.2 ). Another technique, employed in ALF when it is projected that the insult to the native liver will abate and regeneration occur effectively (e.g., acetaminophen toxicity), is to implant a whole or partial graft as an \"auxiliary\" adjacent to the native liver. Ongoing necrosis of the native liver with release of cytokines and toxins can promote an ongoing inflammatory response. If a straightforward \"duct-to-duct\" biliary anastomosis is not possible (for instance in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], or those receiving auxiliary transplants), a hepaticojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y jejunal loop may be formed. This intestinal anastomosis requires rest from feeding for up to 5 days postoperatively. In the case of a donor-recipient mismatch in bile duct diameter, or if the anastomosis is difficult, a T-tube may be inserted at the site of the anastomosis, its stem draining bile into a drain through the abdominal wall. Complex or suboptimal arterial anatomy may lead the surgeon to improvise arterial conduits from donor blood vessels (e.g., iliac), and knowledge of this will permit appropriate vascular investigations postoperatively. Physiological Challenges During Surgery Conventional LT involves several major physiological challenges beyond those usually associated with major abdominal surgery. These are encompassed in the three phases of LT, namely, hepatectomy, anhepatic phase, and reperfusion. During these phases the portal vein and IVC will be clamped, with consequent reduction in venous return to the heart, and de-clamped following implantation, which is associated with further cardiovascular disturbance due to recovery of pre-load and release of vasoactive substances from the donor organ.",

In the previously cirrhotic patient, right heart dysfunction in the context of pulmonary artery hypertension may need to be excluded ( Fig. 53.3a, b) .

Nebulized or intravenous epoprostenol, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan have been used in this context. Acute elevations in PAP and exacerbations in right ventriculoarterial uncoupling occur during reperfusion. A hemodynamic study in patients with pulmonary artery (PA) hypertension demonstrated that although systolic ventricular function increased in response to the sudden change in pre-load, as per the Frank-Starling mechanism, afterload failed to decrease. 7 Use of dobutamine in this scenario demonstrated further increases in RVSWI and reductions in pulmonary afterload, with improved overall pulmonary hemodynamics. 8 Nevertheless, severe right ventricular dysfunction is associated with a poor prognosis.",

Examination of the respiratory system and chest radiograph may reveal pneumothorax, lobar collapse, or pulmonary interstitial edema. Accumulation of alveolar fluid may be due to volume overload, especially if a previously anuric but hemofiltered patient has undergone prolonged surgery without renal replacement. However, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) should be considered if blood products have been administered. Re-expansion pulmonary edema may also occur following intraoperative drainage of longstanding hepatic hydrothorax. Acute lung injury (ALI) progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complication of ALF, and may progress during and after LT. In patients with chronic liver disease, ALI/ARDS can also occur without any other identifiable precipitant, although this is unusual (Fig. 53.4) . Covert respiratory tract sepsis, present prior to transplant, may progress in some patients. Pulmonary infiltrates are common, seen in up to 44% of post-LT cases. In one study, pneumonia accounted for 38% of cases, pulmonary edema for 40%, and ARDS for 8%. Organisms isolated included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pneumocystis carinii. 12 There are no specifically favored ventilatory strategies post-LT; however, there are theoretical disadvantages in terms of liver blood flow with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). 13 This may limit venous return and lead to parenchymal congestion. 14 A recent human study found no impairment in systemic hemodynamics with short-term end-expiratory pressures up to 10 cmH 2 O. 15 Renal RRT will often have been commenced prior to transplant in many ALF cases, and should be continued postoperatively. CLD patients with impaired creatinine clearance are at risk of further reductions in renal function in the context of cardiovascular instability and volume depletion, and 12% of all CLD may develop ARF after surgery, 16 the vast majority (>90%) of whom will regain function. Early RRT is favored if there appears to be a deteriorating trend in excretory function or sustained oligoanuria despite volume repletion and optimum perfusion pressure. Intraoperative administration of mannitol does not appear to preserve renal function. 17 Reno-protective immunosuppression strategies may be appropriate in cases of significantly impaired preoperative renal function, and these are discussed below.",

Blood should be sent for CMV DNA measurement on a weekly basis while in the ICU, and treatment with an antiviral agent (ganciclovir, valganciclovir) commenced if DNA is detected.

An important and possibly underrecognized cause of bone marrow dysfunction is acquired hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or reactive macrophage syndrome. Unregulated macrophage stimulation in the context of viral infection and/or immunosuppression results in auto-ingestion of cell lines, typically accompanied effusions and ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, skin rashes, hyperferritinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia.

A change of emphasis from liver disease to multiple organ dysfunction, with an attendant shift in expectation, must be achieved. In ALF, where the time scale from diagnosis to surgery is far shorter and emotionally challenging to relatives, it is usual for the condition's severity and poor prognosis to have been emphasized before surgery. Perioperative and 3-month mortality rates are higher than in elective transplants, and multiple organ dysfunction, being a part of the ALF syndrome, will be anticipated.",
