            "text": "In the summer of 2016, medical help was summoned on a commercial flight approximately 2 hours after departure from Hong Kong for Vancouver. Four physicians from different nationalities attended the call, namely a pediatric intensivist, a pediatrician, an internal medicine physician, and an orthopedic surgeon. A 66-year-old Chinese man felt unwell and vomited in his seat. He appeared to have rigors and sweating but still managed to give simple responses of yes and no. He denied chest pain and headaches. His wife was anxious but managed to give some key history that the man had a history of influenza-associated carditis and had been put on a twice daily oral steroid for a few weeks. He ate a lot of sushi before boarding and drank some red wine on board. Because the pediatric intensivist was of Chinese ethnicity and spoke the same language, he assumed a leading role in the management. The seat (the middle seat in a row of 3 seats) was dim, and examination was difficult. His heart rate was slow and occasionally irregular (range, 50s-60s). Blood pressure measured by palpation of his right radial pulse and a mercury sphygmomanometer was 110 to 120 (systolic)/60 to 70 (diastolic) mm Hg. Subsequently, a digital pulse oximeter on his finger showed a heart rate range in the 50s to 60s and oxygen saturation in the 70s to 90s. Blood glucose was checked and was within the green (normal) range. Chest auscultation and general examination revealed no sign of heart failure or aspiration pneumonitis. Pupils were equal and reactive. Mask oxygen was given at 2 L/min, but his pulse oximetry readings were around 70 to 90 while he had rigors. He vomited 2 more times and felt better. As he became more stable and without overt evidence of an ischemic heart attack or cerebrovascular accident, the pediatric intensivist and the other physicians agreed that the flight could be continued. The decision was considered pivotal because it affected over 300 passengers if a call for diversion was made, but the life of the patient might have been jeopardized if the flight was continued (a trip of over 10 hours). The patient was regularly reviewed on the flight, and only sips of water were allowed. The intensivist communicated with the ground-based medical assistance, completed a written report, and kept a copy of the report for himself. On landing, the patient appeared cheerful and managed to walk out without assistance by the awaiting team of paramedics. He declined to go to the emergency department in Vancouver. The presumption diagnosis was \u201cmotion sickness.\u201d",

A pediatric trainee attended the call, and she was the only personnel on board. A middle-aged Italian man developed acute shortness of breath and nausea after he woke up from his sleep. He denied any chest pain, headache, or symptoms of neurologic deficits. He had a medical history of anxiety and took diazepam when required. On examination, he was pink with normal capillary refill. Although he was able to finish complete sentences, he experienced shortness of breath and his respiratory rate was elevated; his heart rate was fast and regular. He was not in any pain and did not have any physical weakness. Because he only spoke limited English, the flight attendant helped with translation. Given his medical history and background, this was likely a panic attack; hence, the pediatric trainee immediately suggested him to take the diazepam, calm down, and move to a less enclosed area. No medical equipment, such as a stethoscope, blood pressure monitor, or pulse oximeter, was available from the flight attendant. This man eventually felt better after taking the diazepam and some rest at a flight attendant resting area. His breathing rate and heart rate returned to normal after a while, and he returned to his seat. His symptoms did not recur, and he appeared well when he walked off the plane.",

The incidence of significant in-flight medical emergencies is approximately between 1 per 10,000 and 1 per 40,000 passengers. Peterson et al5 described in-flight medical emergencies and the outcomes of these events. Records of in-flight medical emergency calls from 5 domestic and international airlines to a physician-directed medical communications center from January 1, 2008, through October 31, 2010, were reviewed, which represent approximately 10% of the global passenger flight volume, and medical emergencies were found to occur in 1 of every 604 flights. They characterized the most common medical problems and the type of onboard assistance rendered. The authors determined the incidence of and factors associated with unscheduled aircraft diversion, transport to a hospital, hospital admission and the incidence of death. Most in-flight medical emergencies were not serious and were related to syncope, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms.5 A study by MedAire,10 a specialized company that provides medical advice and management to in-flight medical emergencies showed the most common in-flight medical emergencies were vasovagal episodes (22%), cardiac events (12%), gastrointestinal problems (12%), neurologic symptoms (11%), respiratory difficulties (10%), psychiatric/psychological problems (4%), and endocrine diseases (3%). Cardiac arrest is not common. Other rare in-flight medical emergencies can include injuries sustained from unexpected turbulences and items falling from an overhead luggage compartment.",

Space is limited, and this often makes physical examination and medical treatment a logistical challenge. Treating the passenger in his or her seat is the safest option. The patient can be relocated to first or business class or the gallery if needed. However, treating the patient in an aisle should be avoided because this will impair the ability of the flight crew to perform their required duties.21 Lighting will be suboptimal, and it might be difficult to identify the patient\u2019s subtle color change (eg, cyanosis, which is a very important sign to identify). The ambient noise level is also high, making it nearly impossible to use a stethoscope or to obtain a blood pressure by merely using a sphygmomanometer and auscultation.22 Nevertheless, overt signs of cardiopulmonary failure, neurologic status, and vitals are no different from examination in normal circumstances. The 2 cases show that careful history to rule out cardiopulmonary and neurologic emergency and focused physical examination with attention to vital signs can help make accurate diagnosis and vital decisions. Both cases also illustrate that history taking is vital to medical decision making in terms of diagnosis and management. The issues about language barrier have not been documented in the literature.

Although uncommon, there are documented cases of litigation against the physician who assisted during an in-flight medical emergency. In the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, physician passengers do not have a legal duty to respond to in-flight medical emergencies. In contrast, physician passengers have an obligation to respond in Australia and many European countries.27 The Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998 states that an individual should not be liable when providing assistance in case of an in-flight medical emergency unless the individual is found to be guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct.28 For certain ground-based medical assistance and provided the communication is clear, the medical volunteer on board is relieved of liability and the ground-based medical assistance company will have insurance coverage for the liability as well as the cost of any subsequent diversion.15 Hence, some airlines have a policy to contact the ground-based medical assistance first, before asking for an onboard medical volunteer. In most cases, the airline will have a form for the volunteer medical professional to complete after assisting in the in-flight emergencies, and it is important for the involved medical professional to keep a copy. In case a formal documentation is not done by the airline, it is also recommended that the involved medical professional keep a personal documentation of the event.",
