This single-stranded, DNA-type virus is related closely to canine parvovirus. Cats also can be infected by canine parvovirus and occasionally have clinical signs of disease. The name was derived from the clinical observation that many cats develop severe leukopenia, but this finding is not considered pathognomonic. The disease syndrome also has been called feline distemper. Clinical findings of FPV infection in cats are similar to those associated with canine parvovirus infection.3.\nHow is FPV transmitted and maintained in the environment?\nFPV is shed in all body secretions; large quantities are present in the feces during active stages of infection. Cats continue to shed virus in feces and urine for a maximum of 6 weeks after infection. The virus is ubiquitous in the environment and can survive readily for more than 1 year. Susceptible animals are infected via fecal-oral transmission. Fomites are believed to play an important role in transmission because the virus can survive for prolonged periods on contaminated surfaces. Examples of fomites include clothing, shoes, hands, food dishes, and cages. Flies and other insects may serve as transport hosts during warmer periods of the year.4.\nWhich species are susceptible to FPV? What areas of the body does it infect?\nAll species of Felidae as well as raccoons, coatimundi, and mink are susceptible to the virus. Feline panleukopenia infects rapidly dividing cells; thus it has a predilection for the GI tract, lymphoid tissue, and bone marrow. In prenatal and early neonatal infections, the cerebrum, cerebellum, retina, and optic nerves are also commonly infected, resulting in clinical abnormalities.5.\nIs FPV passed in utero?\nThe virus is passed from queen to fetus. Infection early in pregnancy results in fetal death and resorption with infertility, abortions, or birth of mummified fetuses. If infection occurs closer to term, the kittens are born alive with varying degrees of damage to the late developing neural tissue. Littermates may be affected to varying degrees.6.\nWhat are the effects of FPV infection on the CNS and other developing neuronal tissue in late uterine and early prenatal infection?\nAbout 70\u201380% of small neurons in the cerebellar cortex and granular cell layer of the cerebellum do not develop until after birth. FPV inhibits the normal cerebellar cortical development and migration of cells. The results are the gross pathologic finding of small or hypoplastic cerebellum and histologic findings of distorted cell layers and marked depletion of the granular cells and Purkinje's cells. Less commonly the spinal cord, optic nerve, and retina also may be affected.7.\nWhat is the pathogenesis of FPV-associated GI tract disease?\nAfter oral exposure, the virus induces a plasma viremia. GI disease develops as cells in the intestinal crypts are destroyed. leading to sloughing of the villi. Increased absorption of bacteria and bacterial toxins leads to systemic bacteremia or sepsis.8.\nWhat is the typical signalment of cats with clinical feline panleukopenia?\nThe incidence is highest in cats under 1 year of age. There is no sex or breed predisposition. Often there is a seasonal increase in late summer to early fall, when the major annual crop of kittens is at the end of maternal antibody protection. The frequency of clinical disease is much lower than the actual number of cats infected with the virus. Most adult cats have subclinical infection. The finding of a high infection rate with low incidence of clinical disease in older cats is supported by a high prevalence of FPV antibody titers in the adult cat population; up to 75% of presumably unvaccinated feral cats are seropositive.9.\nDescribe the clinical presentation of kittens with prenatal or early postnatal FPV infection.\nKittens infected transplacentaly or shortly after birth often appear normal until they start to walk. At that time, varying degrees of ataxia, incoordination, intention tremors, broad-based stance, hypermetria, and falling are frequently observed. Affected kittens have normal mental status, which is typical of cerebellar hypoplasia. Some may have signs of forebrain involvement, such as seizures, behavioral abnormalities, or postural reaction deficits accompanied by a normal gate. The ataxia is nonprogressive.10.\nDescribe the clinical presentation in kittens with late postnatal FPV infection.\nGeneralized infection in young unvaccinated cats is the most common form of FPV disease. Severe disease may result in acute death. In less severe cases, fever (104\u2013107\u00b0F), anorexia, and depression precede presentation by 3\u20134 days. At some time during the course of the disease, vomiting that is not associated with eating often develops. Diarrhea is a common but not consistent finding. The intestines may be painful and feel thickened during abdominal palpation. In complicated cases, bloody diarrhea, icterus, and severe dehydration may develop.11.\nWhat laboratory abnormalities are associated with feline panleukopenia?\nSpecific laboratory abnormalities are found most often in the complete blood count. Severe panleukopenia is seen often but not in every case. In severe infections, the total white cell count varies between 50 and 3,000 cells/\u03bcl; in more moderate cases, between 3000 and 7000 cells/\u03bcl. Complete blood counts should be repeated because other diseases also may present with panleukopenia. The leukopenia associated with FPV resolves within a few days of recovery from illness. Thus, it can be differentiated from other causes of chronic leukopenia. If prolonged panleukopenia exists, other diseases, such as feline leukemia or septic salmonellosis, should be considered. The severity of the leukopenia often reflects the severity of clinical illness. A mild decrease in hematocrit and absolute reticulocyte count may be present in cats with viremia but should not result in marked anemia, unless severe GI bleeding occurs. The anemia remains mild because of the short course of the disease and the long life span of red blood cells. In cases of severe infection, thrombocytopenia may develop. Clotting abnormalities consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) also can be detected in severe infection.Biochemical abnormalities are usually nonspecific. Azotemia due to dehydration is most often detected. Mild renal damage also may result from viral replication. In rare cases, mild elevations of liver enzyme activities may be detected. Hypoglycemia and hypokalemia result from sepsis and GI losses, respectively.12.\nHow is feline panleukopenia diagnosed?\nA presumptive diagnosis is based on the presence of appropriate clinical findings in a susceptible host after exclusion of other diseases that produce acute GI signs or leukopenia. Peracute and acute cases must be differentiated from intoxication or foreign body ingestion; careful history taking is vital. Abdominal radiographs as well as fecal examination for parasites should be performed to rule out intestinal obstruction or extreme parasite burden. Clinical signs also may be compatible with acute toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis often has accompanying respiratory signs, which may be helpful in differentiating between the two diseases. Negative feline leukemia virus status also should be confirmed.Exposure to FPV can be confirmed by documenting increasing antibody titer on samples taken at the time of presentation and 2 weeks later. A fourfold rise in titer is supportive of acute infection. Presence of viral particles in feces on electron microscopy or viral antigens in feces by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also can confirm exposure to FPV. However, canine parvovirus ELISA has not been validated for use with feline feces, and neither electron microscopy nor ELISA can distinguish modified live vaccine strains from virulent strains.13.\nHow is FP treated?\nSymptomatic and supportive care are the cornerstones of therapy. Fluid therapy, control of GI signs, antimicrobial therapy, potassium replacement, maintenance of euglycemia, and control of oncotic pressure are key components. Specific antiviral treatment is not available. The key is to support the patient until the immune response is able to overcome the infection.14.\nWhat fluid therapy is suggested?\nFluid deficits and ongoing losses should be corrected parenterally. Use of a jugular catheter is preferred over other sites because the jugular catheter is usually not positional, can be used to obtain blood samples, is not likely to be contaminated with feces, is unlikely to develop phlebitis, and allows monitoring of central venous pressure. The fluid deficit (body wt [kg] \u00d7 percent dehydrated \u00d7 1000 = ml) is replaced over 24 hours, along with estimates of ongoing losses and maintenance. Balanced isotonic fluid replacement is used with potassium supplementation. Electrolytes should be measured intermittently to aid in determining potassium needs; a minimum of 20 mEq/L should be used. Blood glucose should be monitored and supplemented as indicated. If clinical evidence of decreased oncotic pressure (peripheral or pulmonary edema) is present concurrently with hypoalbuminemia, plasma or colloids should be administered. Anemia due to severe GI blood loss may develop in addition to hypoproteinemia; therefore, blood transfusion may be needed. Platelet count, fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and clotting times should be assessed in moribund or septic cats to evaluate for possible DIC.15.\nHow are GI signs of FP managed?\nEliminating oral intake of food and water decreases the amount of vomiting and slows replication of intestinal cells in the GI tract, which is needed for viral replication. Antiemetics may be used to control vomiting, if necessary. Anticholinergic medications should not be used because they produce ileus. First-line antiemetic therapy is metoclopramide, administered subcutaneously at 0.2\u20130.5 mg/kg every 6\u20138 hr. If vomiting persists, a continuous infusion of metoclopramide (1\u20132 mg/kg/day) is often helpful. Water can be reintroduced no sooner than 24 hours after cessation of vomiting. Initially, small amounts of water should be offered. If no vomiting occurs for 24 hours, small amounts of a bland food (specifically a commercial GI diet or rice with small amounts of baby food) may be introduced. If feedings are tolerated, the amount should be increased gradually. After the patient is consuming normal amounts, a slow transition over 4\u20136 days should be made to regular maintenance diet.16.\nWhat antibiotics should be used if findings of bacteremia or sepsis exist?\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics, such as ampicillin (22 mg/kg intravenously every 6\u20138 hr) or a first-generation cephalosporin (20\u201325 mg/kg intravenously every 6\u20138 hr) should be used to help prevent systemic bacterial infection. If sepsis is suspected, a fluoroquinolone (5\u201310 mg/kg intramuscularly or intravenously every 24 hr) or an aminoglycoside (3 mg/kg intravenously every 8hr) can be added to improve the gram-negative spectrum. Aminoglycosides should not be administered until the cat is well hydrated and potassium deficits have been corrected to lessen the chance of nephrotoxicity. Alternatively, a second-generation cephalosporin can be used. Antibiotic therapy also may decrease bacterial counts in the GI tract, which are known to increase mitotic rate of intestinal epithelia. In germ-free kittens, the clinical manifestations are not as severe.17.\nIs passive immunotherapy of benefit in the treatment of FP?\nIn dogs, administration of lyophilized serum from hyperimmune dogs decreases morbidity associated with canine parvovirus infection. Although data from cats are not available, the same principle probably applies because the pathogenesis is similar to that in dogs. Administration of 1 ml/kg of plasma or serum from a well-vaccinated cat or survivor of feline panleukopenia may be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously.18.\nHow long do colostral antibodies and maternal virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies persist in kittens?\nColostral antibodies have a half-life of 9.5 days. Thus, maternal VN antibodies may interfere with vaccination until 12\u201314 weeks of age.19.\nWhen should kittens be vaccinated? With what type of vaccine?\nKittens presented for vaccination before 12 weeks of age should receive either inactivated or modified live vaccines every 3 weeks until they are 12 weeks of age. Kittens presented for vaccination after 12 weeks of age should receive two inactivated vaccines, 3 weeks apart, or 1 modified live vaccine. Boosters should be given at 1 year of age and then no more frequently than every 3 years. In one study, cats vaccinated with two inactivated vaccines had 100% protection when challenged with virulent FPV 7.5 years later. There is no benefit from use of intranasal products. Queens should be vaccinated before pregnancy; if vaccinated during gestation, they should receive only inactivated products because modified live vaccines may infect the fetal or neonatal cerebellum. Kittens born to naive queens may be vaccinated as soon as 4 weeks of age with inactivated products.20.\nHow is the virus inactivated once in the environment?\nIf FP is diagnosed in a household, a 1:32 dilution of household bleach should be used on all cages, bowls, litter pans, and floors. Plastic litter pans should be discarded because of the difficulty in disinfecting. New cats with past infection of FPV should not be introduced into the household without prior vaccination. Other susceptible cats in the household usually show initial signs (anorexia, lethargy, and vomiting) in 2\u20136 days. Passive immunity, as described in question 17, should be considered for exposed susceptible cats that need immediate protection.21.\nWhat are feline coronaviruses? How are they transmitted?\nThe coronaviruses are ubiquitous RNA viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Some isolates are limited to the intestinal tract, leading to subclinical infection in most (feline enteric coronavirus [FECV]). Other isolates have the ability to infect macrophages, disseminate through the body, and induce the clinical syndrome known as feline infectious peritonitis (see Chapter 38).22.\nWhat are the clinical signs in cats infected with FECV?\nWhen clinical signs occur, mild small bowel diarrhea is usually present. Occasionally, mucus and fresh blood also may be seen. Occasionally, vomiting, low-grade fever, anorexia, and lethargy may accompany the diarrhea. Clinical signs often resolve within 2\u20134 days. Although enteric coronaviruses are limited to the GI tract, spontaneous mutation to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-inducing strains can occur in the host.23.\nHow is a diagnosis of FECV infection made?\nFECV infection is often a diagnosis of exclusion. It is important to rule out more common causes of mild diarrhea and vomiting, such as foreign body ingestion, parasite infestation, dietary intolerance, intestinal perforation, and other enteric viruses. Documentation of increasing coronavirus antibody titers suggests recent infection. FECV can be documented in feces with electron microscopy or virus isolation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction also can be used to detect RNA of the organism in feces.24.\nHow is clinical FECV infection treated?\nTreatment consists of supportive care (as in feline panleukopenia), but sepsis is less likely. Fluid therapy and gut rest are the most important components.25.\nHow is FECV infection prevented?\nIn crowded environments, most cats are seropositive for coronavirus antibodies. It is estimated that approximately 30% of seropositive cats are shedding coronaviruses in stool at any one time. The spread of the virus in catteries is highly efficient, and prevention of spread is essentially impossible. Stress should be avoided if possible, and care should be taken to lessen crowding of litter boxes. Vaccination with the intranasal coronavirus vaccine is not warranted because of the mild clinical signs seen in cats and associated low morbidity.26.\nCan serology be used to differentiate FECV from FIP-inducing strains?\nCurrently no serologic test can differentiate antibodies against FECV from those against FIP-inducing strains (see Chapter 38).\n",
