            "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are omnipresent in all three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Of the two major types of TEs, that is, retrotransposons and DNA transposons, the latter are particularly prone to horizontal transmission (see Silva et al. 2004 for review). First inferred from patchy distribution of P-elements in Drosophila spp. (Kidwell 1983; Daniels et al. 1990) and mariner transposons in insects (Robertson 1993), horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was subsequently suggested to constitute the primary mode of survival for DNA transposons of this type (Robertson and Lampe 1995; Hartl et al. 1997). According to this scenario, a DNA TE enters a new host and proliferates within its genome, giving rise to multiple copies, which then undergo silencing, mutational decay, and eventually get erased from the host genome, so that the long-term persistence of a TE depends on the ability of a functional copy to escape into a new host. During such horizontal escapes, however, TEs do not typically cross domain boundaries: no cases of recent HGT between Bacteria (or Archaea) and Eukarya have been documented to date, and naturally occurring cases incompatible with vertical inheritance typically involve movements between taxonomically close groups (Daniels et al. 1990; Diao et al. 2006; Pace et al. 2008; reviewed in Feschotte and Pritham 2007). Interkingdom transfers, for example, from animals into protists and bacteria, have been accomplished in the laboratory (Gueiros-Filho and Beverley 1997; Rubin et al. 1999). In these cases, however, expression of the transposase gene involved its placement under a heterologous promoter known to be functional in the new host (e.g., Rubin et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2000). Fundamental differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression, such as incompatible basal promoter elements, translation start sites, or coupling between transcription and translation, may, at least in part, account for the barriers to successful interdomain transfers.",

As telomeric regions of bdelloid genomes contain numerous foreign genes originated in bacteria, fungi, or plants, it was therefore not as surprising as it could have been in the absence of a massive HGT that a DNA transposon of apparently bacterial origin was also able to find its way into the bdelloid genome. Interestingly, however, this TE appears to have been much less successful in adapting to the new host environment than certain bacterial protein\u2013coding genes, such as the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase gene that is transcribed, spliced, and encodes a functional protein (Gladyshev et al. 2008). As described below, IS5_Av integration apparently represented a one-time event and did not result in proliferation in the new host, possibly due to the lack of compatibility with the transcriptional\u2013translational apparatus or damage to the element. Our study indicates that in nature, given the opportunity, TEs highly similar to prokaryotic could incorporate into metazoan chromosomes. Alternatively, IS5_Av could represent the sole member of a hitherto unknown eukaryotic TE superfamily.",

            "text": "Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot hybridization experiments were done as described in Gladyshev and Arkhipova (2007). The following primers were used for PCR amplification: TIR, GAGTAAAGTTTTGTGTTCACTG; RT-F1, GTCAGAATGGAGTCGCAACA; and RT-R1, TCGGTGGTTACAACAATCACA. AvDdl primers were as in Gladyshev et al. (2008). Southern blots and genomic library were probed with the 32P-labeled 1,637-bp fragment amplified by the TIR primer and with the 534-bp fragment amplified with the RT-F1\u2013RT-R1 primer pair. The IS5 data set was assembled from 1) IS Finder database entries (www-is.biotoul.fr), including at least three representatives from each subgroup of the IS5 group, and all representatives from the ISL2 group; 2) Repbase entries (www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html), including representatives of the Harbinger/PIF and IS4EU/ISL2EU superfamilies; 3) top GenBank hits from diverse archaea and bacteria identified by Blast search; and 4) IS5-like families in protist genomes identified by Blast search. Amino acid sequences were aligned with T-Coffee (Notredame et al. 2000) and Clustalw implemented in MEGA4 (Tamura et al. 2007). Neighbor-joining and minimum evolution analyses were done with MEGA4 (p-distance or Poisson correction; pairwise deletion; 1,000 bootstrap replications). The value of the parameter gamma was determined by ProtTest (Abascal et al. 2005). Alternative start codons were analyzed using the EasyGene server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/EasyGene/). Search for the TSD\u2013TIR\u2026TIR\u2013TSD combination (TSD, target site duplication) was performed on a 1,419-bp region upstream and a 784-bp region downstream from the hobo open reading frame (ORF; between the stop codon of the upstream NHL gene and the 5\u2032 long terminal repeat (LTR) of a downstream TE), using a custom Perl script allowing one or two mismatches. Only cases with 8-bp TSD were considered, as hobo_Av is phylogenetically close to insect hobo elements and therefore should not deviate from the general rule specifying 8-bp TSDs for hobo-like TEs (Rubin et al. 2001). Unusual hAT elements yielding atypical 5- and 6-bp TSD (Putnam et al. 2007) belong to very distant and well-separated clades (data not shown).",

The transposon harbors a single ORF exhibiting similarity to transposases of the IS4\u2013IS5 families (table 1; pfam01609:Transposase_11, which includes prokaryotic transposases for IS4, IS421, IS5377, IS427, IS402, IS1355, and IS5, and is a member of the DDE megafamily of transposases/integrases), and which contains all of the highly conserved residues required for catalytic activity of these enzymes. A multiple sequence alignment of IS5-like transposases is provided as Supplementary data, Supplementary Material online. The IS5_Av transposon is flanked by 213-bp perfect TIRs, including a 2- to 6-bp ambiguity in the outermost nucleotides CATATG\u2026CATATG, all or part of which could also be regarded as a 2-, 4-, or 6-bp TSD (TA, ATAT, or CATATG). Such ambiguity can usually be resolved by comparing different flanking sequences from additional genomic TE copies. To our surprise, we were unable to identify any such copies, neither by exhaustive genomic library screens (data not shown) nor in Southern analyses using two different restriction enzyme combinations (fig. 2a). The single band on a Southern blot of A. vaga genomic DNA digested with PvuII, which has no recognition sites within IS5_Av, demonstrates that this is the only copy present in the genome. The size of the band (7.0 kb) coincides with the expected size of the PvuII fragment harboring IS5_Av on the sequenced telomeric fosmid, ruling out possible contamination or misassembly in the course of random shotgun sequencing of fosmid subclones. Similarly, XhoI\u2013HpaI digest of genomic DNA yields an expected 4-kb band. In addition, sequencing of cloned and total PCR products obtained with the TIR primer, as expected, revealed no nucleotide sequence polymorphisms, which might have been observed if different full-length copies existed in the genome but were not present in the genomic library (data not shown).",

This particular region has no homologous partner among A. vaga chromosomes, because collinearity between homologous telomeres K_A and K_B begins \u223c50 kb proximally to IS5_Av (see fig. S1 in Gladyshev et al. 2008), and therefore, IS5_Av exists as the only copy per diploid genome. In figure 1B, it may be seen that this element is located in an exceptionally TE-rich environment: It is apparently inserted into the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of a hobo-like transposon and is surrounded by three mariner-like, one retrovirus-like, and two piggyBac-like transposons. The distance from IS5_Av to the chromosome end is 19.6 kb. The hobo element has several defects in its ORF, and therefore likely represents an ancient insertion; other TEs also carry in-frame stop codons, frameshifts, or indels (table 2). Interestingly, each mariner or piggyBac copy belongs to a different subfamily within the corresponding superfamily, underscoring the considerable diversity of DNA TEs in bdelloids.",

The putatively bacterial origin indicated by similarity scores is also suggested by phylogenetic analysis (fig. 3). It may be seen that IS5_Av from A. vaga clusters with a specific subgroup of IS5-like TEs, namely, the ISL2 group, which is characterized by 15- to 40-bp TIRs, and TSD ranging between 0, 2, 3 and 7 bp, with preference for TA- or TNA-containing targets (Chandler and Mahillon 2002; www-is.biotoul.fr). There are two known eukaryotic DNA TE superfamilies that are related to the IS5 group of bacterial TEs: Harbinger/PIF (containing Transposase_11 converted domain, CD; 3-bp TSD) and IS4EU/ISL2EU (yielding no transposase-related CD hits; 2-bp TSD) (Kapitonov and Jurka 2004, 2007; Zhang et al. 2004), which form distinct eukaryotic clades in figure 3. The A. vaga IS5-like element, however, does not fall into any of these clades and neither does it contain any additional ORFs, which represent one of the defining characteristics of Harbinger/PIF and IS4EU/ISL2EU superfamilies. Interestingly, all members of the ISL2 subgroup from the IS Finder database fall into two clades, rather than into a single ISL2 clade. We therefore designated the clade not containing ISL2 as the IS493 group, by the name of its first described representative.",

One of T. vaginalis ORFs (TVAG_485520) is single copy and is not framed by TIRs, suggesting domestication of this transposase-derived gene, whereas four others represent typical DNA TEs with a single ORF and 10\u201320 highly similar copies per T. vaginalis genome. In the Trichomonas families containing TVAG_135750 and TVAG_517480, the transposase domain is fused to the ubiquitin hydrolase-like cysteine peptidase (clan CA, family C19), whereas in the families containing TVAG_148970 and TVAG_413280, the transposase domain is not fused to any other domains. Despite the fact that these two groups of Trichomonas IS5-like families differ substantially in their amino acid sequence and their monophyly is not well supported, they share a peculiar feature: Their relatively long TIRs (180\u2013290 bp) contain shorter imperfect hairpin regions, ultimately resulting in formation of an imperfect direct repeat embedded into each of the inverted repeats. It is conceivable that this entire group (designated ISL2PR) evolved upon invasion of the ancestral protistan genome by an IS5-like transposon. However, IS5_Av does not fall into this group either. Instead, it occupies a very basal position in the ISL2 clade, together with two IS5-derived genes from the heterolobosean Naegleria gruberi. Because this clade is not well supported, it is difficult to say whether an IS5-like element was transferred from bacteria into both A. vaga and N. gruberi or between a Naegleria-like protist and A. vaga.",

As the use of splicing or ribosomal frameshifting could in principle lead to production of a full-length transposase in the apparent absence of a correctly positioned ATG codon, we decided to examine the transcriptional activity of the element. RT-PCR analysis of A. vaga RNA (fig. 2B) demonstrates that the level of IS5_Av transcripts, if present, is below the detection limits of the technique, whereas the positive control, the A. vaga Ddl gene (Gladyshev et al. 2008), as expected, yields a band corresponding to a transcribed and spliced message. The lack of transcriptional activity may account for IS5 inability to give rise to additional copies, perhaps due to the incompatibility of the promoter sequences with the host transcriptional machinery. Alternatively, the element may have been inactivated by a deletion interfering with RNA stability. Finally, IS5_Av may have been inactivated by a frameshift due to a replication slippage in a T8 stretch at pos. 782, whereby deletion of a T would yield a 317-aa ORF, adding 7 aa to the uninterrupted 310-aa polypeptide sequence, or addition of a T would yield a 373-aa ORF. Such an extended ORF, however, does not exhibit additional similarity to the N-termini of any known elements, and there is no apparent reason for transcriptional inactivation due to a single frameshift.",

We scanned the IS5_Av sequence with EasyGene (Larsen and Krogh 2003; Nielsen and Krogh 2005), which uses a high-quality training set of genes coding for known conserved proteins from each genome to estimate hidden Markov models (HMM) of gene prediction for that particular genome. Of the 138 species with HMM models in the database, 48 did not yield a predicted gene in the 2,020-bp IS5_Av sequence; the first ATG codon at pos. 1,040 was predicted as the optimal start site in 46 species, and as a suboptimal start site in 5 species; the TTG codon at pos. 788 (yielding a 308-aa transposase) was found to be optimal in 24 species and suboptimal in 2 species, and the GTG codon at pos. 884 (yielding a 276-aa transposase) was found to be optimal in 3 species and suboptimal in 2 species (see table 3 for a list of alternative codons, and supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, for a complete list of predicted start codons). Thus, for approximately one-third of all database species that yielded gene predictions, the alternative start codons were predicted to be optimal. Although we do not yet know the identity of the putative donor species, it is worth noting that the genera such as Bacteroides, Burkholderia, and Pseudomonas, all of which are represented in table 3, have already been identified as putative donors of foreign genes to bdelloids (Gladyshev et al. 2008).",

Single-copy TEs are quite rare in eukaryotes, and whenever one TE copy per genome is reported, it is usually identified in a search of genome databases, which are far from being complete, especially when it comes to repetitive regions that are often left unassembled and are missing from most databases.

(The third possibility, i.e., indefinite maintenance of a single domesticated copy in the genome by purifying selection due to acquisition of a cellular function, usually involves loss of TIRs and is therefore highly unlikely.) At which of these two time points did we find IS5_Av? If it were about to become lost from the A. vaga genome after having peaked in copy number, it may be expected to have undergone extensive ORF-damaging mutational decay, often accompanied by secondary insertions, so that the coding region would require molecular reconstruction and the TIRs would have accumulated differences. The perfect identity of the TIRs and the absence of interruptions in the ORF make the recent entry hypothesis more plausible. The lack of expression from a single genomic copy is indicative of its pseudogene nature, and the integrity of a \u223c300-aa pseudogene would be typically compromised by mutational decay in a few million years (Lynch and Conery 2000, 2003). IS5_Av resides within an ancient hobo-like element, which underwent insertions of two TEs and, in addition, carries defects in its ORF (a frameshift and an in-frame stop codon). Although the hobo itself is rather decayed, IS5_Av is most likely inserted into the 3\u2032 UTR of hobo, because the distance between the hobo stop codon and the IS5_Av insertion site is only 108 bp and does not include polyadenylation signals (which are found downstream from the IS5_Av insertion). A search for TSD\u2013TIR for hobo revealed only one putative 8 bp-TIR\u2013TIR-8 bp combination, fully consistent with IS5_Av insertion into the hobo 3\u2032 UTR. Thus, it appears that IS5_Av underwent integration into the A. vaga chromosome on its own and not as a component of delivery vehicles such as phages or viruses, fragments of which would have been detectable in the adjacent genomic environment (but see further discussion below).",

Although the putative donor species is yet to be identified, and there are no other IS5_Av copies in the genome that could be used to determine the level of divergence between copies so as to estimate their arrival time, this HGT event may be regarded as relatively recent for reasons discussed above. The absence of detectable transcription from IS5_Av raises questions regarding the mechanisms responsible for its transfer and successful one-time integration into the A. vaga genome. It may be thought that DNA TEs are more prone to HGT because they can be transmitted as transpososomes\u2013nucleoprotein complexes containing TE DNA and the element-encoded transposase, which are sufficient for integration into the target in vitro (in the presence of Mg2+) as well as in vivo. This capacity of the bacterial Tn5 transpososome, for instance, was even utilized in commercial applications (Reznikoff et al. 2004). Perhaps HGT of IS5_Av into A. vaga occurred when the transposon entered the germ line via routes operating during HGT of other foreign genes (Gladyshev et al. 2008), or possibly as a complex with the element-encoded transposase, which was able to complete the integration reaction. However, subsequent adaptation of the transcription\u2013translation control sequences to the new host did not take place, and therefore its genomic mobility was restricted to the initial integration event, because it has never had a chance to produce transposase molecules in the new host, or perhaps yielded only misfolded and/or mislocalized molecules, even if the level of transcription (undetectable by PCR) was sufficient to produce any.",

However, mutation of the ATG codon per se does not imply an immediate loss of promoter activity and cessation of transcription. The absence of a correctly positioned ATG codon could rather indicate that IS5_Av was using a noncanonical initiation codon, such as TTG or GTG, in its previous host. It is also formally possible that an ATG-less incoming DNA copy was bound to a functional transposase produced in trans, and entered the A. vaga genome as a transposition complex for one-time integration.",

This explanation assumes that the invading copy was fully capable of expression and transposition in A. vaga, but was lost very rapidly without a chance to spur more than one daughter copy.",

It should be emphasized that members of both previously described eukaryotic IS4/IS5-like superfamilies typically contain another ORF in addition to transposase: In the case of Harbingers, this extra ORF is characterized by a SANT/Myb/trihelix motif (Kapitonov and Jurka 2004), whereas for IS4EU/ISL2EU, it resembles a lambda DNA exonuclease, and the transposase itself contains an N-terminal DNA-binding THAP domain (Kapitonov and Jurka 2007). Because none of these extra ORFs (and domains) could be identified in IS5_Av, it appears likely that the element belongs to a single-ORF family, as do most other bacterial TEs related to IS4 and IS5 (www-is.biotoul.fr; Chandler and Mahillon 2002). The newly identified protistan IS5-like elements also differ substantially from IS5_Av, both by phylogenetic placement and by the TIR structure. Neither does IS5_Av represent a domesticated single-copy TE (as is the case for many Harbinger-derived genes), because such domestication usually involves loss of TIRs, which are present in IS5_Av and extend for 213 bp without a single mismatch. Although bacterial TIRs in the ISL2 group usually fall within 10- to 40-bp range (http://www-is.biotoul.fr), exceptionally longer TIRs (up to 214 bp) are rare but not unprecedented in other bacterial IS groups (Kholodii et al. 2000).",
