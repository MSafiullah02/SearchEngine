The routine diagnosis of mycobacteriosis relies primarily on the detection of acid-fast-stained bacilli in the samples by microscopic observation, and the infecting mycobacterial species can be identified with conventional tests including observation of colony morphology and pigmentation, growth rate, and biochemical characteristics (Cernoch , 1994; Metchock , 1999). Disadvantages of this approach include the time taken to provide clinically relevant information. The clinician must initiate therapy for Mycobacterium tuberculosis against NTM infection several weeks before species identification (Montessori , 1996), which may increase health care costs, and may reduce the social activity of the patients. Therefore rapid detection and identification of the species level of mycobacteria is required, both to decide whether measures are needed to prevent the spread of the disease and for adequate therapy (American Thoracic Society, 1997).",

The LAMP reaction requires a Bst DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize six distinct sequences on the target DNA, the specificity of which should be extremely high. The amplification products are stem-loop DNA structures with several inverted repeats of the target. The advantage of the LAMP method is that the reaction is performed under isothermal conditions of between 60 and 65\u00b0C. As a result, it requires only simple and cost-effective reaction equipment. The LAMP method has emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate genetic testing for various infectious diseases (Enosawa , 2003; Iwamoto , 2003; Kuboki , 2003; Ihira , 2004; Parida , 2004; Thai , 2004).",

The PCR products with U1F and U1R, from 27 mycobacterial species, showed the ragged pattern around 400 bp in size (data not shown). Therefore, we determined nucleotide sequences, corresponding to position 228\u2013612 bp of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, of all 27 species (Fig. 1a). The alignment of the sequence shows that the region (298\u2013508 bp) in the amplified products had the highest species-specific variability (Fig. 1b). The size of the variable fragment in dnaA ranged from 154 bp in M. triviale to 232 bp in M. kansasii. The variable region exhibits a reasonable number of nucleotide substitution and insertion or deletion sites, which is important for the development of a differential diagnostic tool. The lowest interspecies similarity was 28.2% in M. leprae versus M. vaccae. The similarity between M. avium and M. intracellulare was 78.3% and that between M. marinum and M. ulcerans was 97.7%. Pathogenic M. kansasii were easily differentiated from nonpathogenic M. gastri (83.6%). The sequences of M. tuberculosis, M. microti, M. africanum, and M. bovis were found to be identical, except for one nucleotide substitution that occurred in M. bovis. When clinical isolates from clinically relevant mycobacterial strains were analyzed, the following minor variation was found among each species: 97.7\u2013100% (M. avium) and 96.0\u2013100% (M. intracellulare). We did not find any intraspecies variation in 10 clinical isolates and the standard strain of M. kansasii. Because other reports using different systems revealed the existence of more than one sequevar (Yang , 1993; Alcaide , 1997), we may need to examine a bigger number of clinical isolates.",

The sizes of the fragments generated after digestion were in good agreement with sizes predicted theoretically from the expected DNA structure: 100 and 93 bp by NaeI digestion, and 123 and 98 bp by HaeII digestion (Fig. 4a).

Domain 1 is involved in oligomerization and interaction with DnaB, Domain 2 constitutes a flexible loop, Domain 3 has ATPase function, and Domain 4 is sufficient for specific binding to DNA. The variable region that we identified in the dnaA sequence was equivalent to the Domain 2 coding nucleotide sequence (Fig. 1).

Each gene has several advantages and disadvantages. An excessive degree of variability is found in the hsp65 gene (Telenti , 1993), which may hinder the development of reliable probes. While 16s rRNA gene sequence is identical in M. kansasii and M. gastri and shows narrow divergenicity within species (Taylor , 1997), ITS sequence can be used to distinguish between M. kansasii and M. gastri (Roth , 1998). While M. kansasii is a representative pathogenic mycobacteria, M. gastri does not induce an apparent disease. The discrimination between these mycobacteria provides useful information to select the appropriate therapy. The percent similarity of ITS between two species was 93% (Roth , 1998), and that of the dnaA variable region was found to be 83.6%. These observations may indicate the usefulness of the dnaA gene for discrimination of these species, at least in complement with ITS.",

Although this may be an ideal approach, it requires expensive equipment as well as a well-trained person in diagnostic laboratories. The LAMP method could be conducted under isothermal conditions ranging from 60 to 65\u00b0C by a single enzyme. The only equipment needed for LAMP reaction is a regular laboratory water bath or a heat block that furnishes a constant temperature around 63\u00b0C. LAMP does not require a thermal cycling step, and an isothermal reaction for a short time (60 min) is enough to amplify the target DNA to a detectable level. As PCR and other molecular biological techniques are conducted in well-equipped laboratories, these methodologies are often impracticable under a field diagnosis.",
