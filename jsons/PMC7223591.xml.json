With increasing exposures to antimicrobials, organisms that were once easily treatable now harbor mechanisms of resistance that leave few treatment options for clinicians. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, formerly known as Enterobacteriaceae, are a group of organisms that are among the most difficult to treat; therefore, it is no surprise that the CDC considers them to be one of the top three most urgent threats with resistance spreading rapidly in the USA and throughout the world [2]. As of 2018, the CDC has reported at least one type of carbapenemase in all 50 states, and rarer genotypic expressions are becoming more common [3]. Prior to the introduction of novel \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors with activity against carbapenemase producers, mortality rates varied from 24% to as high as 74% [4, 5]. It is imperative that clinicians understand definitions of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), local resistance patterns, and how to optimize treatment based on infection site.",

            "text": "There are major oversights when discussing carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO) or CREs. For one, CRE\u2019s simplified definition of Enterobacterales resistant to carbapenems does an injustice to the complexities of developed mechanisms of resistance [6]. Combinations of extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL), overexpression of ampC and loss of porin channels may confer resistance to ertapenem but meropenem or imipenem may remain active [7\u20139]. While considered to be CRE using conventional definitions, these non-carbapenemase-producing organisms may be amenable to high-dose carbapenem therapy and do not pose the same potential for transmissibility due to their lack of plasmid conferred resistance [10]. In contrast to these non-carbapenemase-producing organisms, it is important to delineate if CRE are carbapenemase producers as differing enzymes will have variable phenotypic profiles to commercially available antimicrobials as well as a high degree of transmissibility due to their plasmid-mediated resistance profiles. OXA-48, a serine-based carbapenemase, may hydrolyze carbapenems, yet ceftazidime and cefepime will retain activity if no other mechanisms of resistance are expressed [11, 12]. Isolates may and often have additional mechanisms of resistance included with carbapenemase. Additional subtleties with carbapenem resistance occur demonstrating the need for more specific terminology. Moreover, the likelihood of different types of resistance varies between geographical regions. North America and Israel tend to have a higher prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) whereas metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) can be found in India, Italy, and Greece [7, 13\u201317]. OXA carbapenemases are endemic to Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East [7, 11, 12, 14]. A potential treatment option for a KPC may not necessarily treat an MBL and can be overlooked using broad terminology like CRE. Table 1 highlights different groups and classifications of \u03b2-lactamase including potential carbapenemase producers.",

An international guideline on polymyxin published in 2019 attempts to promote the optimal use of these drugs [20].

Aminoglycosides carry an increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity compared with the antimicrobials mentioned above [27]. Higher rates of adverse events occur with more frequent dosing, and a modified once-daily dosing regimen as demonstrated in the Hartford nomogram may mitigate these risks [28]. Aminoglycosides can play a crucial role in CRE because their mechanism of action is not affected by carbapenemases; however, many CRE organisms harbor aminoglycoside modification enzymes (AME) [29, 30]. As such, the therapeutic role of conventional aminoglycosides, like gentamicin and amikacin, can be highly variable based on the widespread geographic distribution of AMEs.",

A phase III trial (CARE study) attempted to demonstrate efficacy of plazomicin combination therapy compared with polymyxin combination therapy for a multitude of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections [34]. Although the study did not reach an adequate power due to slow enrollment into the study, researchers reported a descriptive decrease in all-cause mortality. Fifteen patients who received plazomicin combination therapy were further evaluated to determine if adequate concentrations of each drug were achieved [35]. Of the 15 subjects treated with plazomicin combination, 0% treated with plazomicin and meropenem reached a meropenem fT > MIC of 40%. Furthermore, only 75% of subjects treated with combination plazomicin and tigecycline reached tigecycline fAUC/MIC concentrations of 0.9 mg/L or greater, yet 83% of subjects with inadequate meropenem or tigecycline concentrations achieved microbiological response.

Plazomicin blood samples were collected 10 h post dose to determine an appropriate dosing interval based on the Hartford nomogram. Afterwards, the information was simulated to predict toxic trough concentrations greater than 3 mg/L and an efficacious interval-normalized AUC.

As a result, it is not surprising that treatment failure and the development of resistance on therapy have been observed in these pre-selected salvage use scenarios. Specifically, the emergence of a mutant KPC-3 variant has been noted during therapy [54]. While resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam, the organism\u2019s genotype reverted to resemble that of an ESBL testing susceptible to meropenem and not surprisingly to other BL/BLIs like meropenem-vaborbactam [55]. Shields and colleagues also proposed ceftazidime-avibactam treatment failure correlates to patients treated for healthcare-associated pneumonias and continuous renal replacement therapy [56]. Their single-center retrospective study looked at treatment failure with ceftazidime-avibactam and found that 60% of clinical failures were treated for pneumonia compared with 29% of successes (p = 0.045, OR 3.09, 1.03\u20139.34). Similar success and failure trends were seen with continuous renal replacement therapy at 7% and 37% respectively (p = 0.046, OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.03\u201322.2). This raises the question whether resistance and treatment failure were observed because of inappropriate dosing in these critically ill patients.

Motsch and colleagues recently published a randomized controlled trial comparing imipenem-relebactam to imipenem and colistin for imipenem non-susceptible bacterial infections [67]. Out of the 31 modified microbiologic intent to treat population, a majority of isolates were P. aeruginosa, (77%) followed by Klebsiella spp. (16%) and other Enterobacterales (6%). Imipenem-relebactam was considered non-inferior for microbiological cure (71%) compared with imipenem and colistin (70%) and had a significant 28-day favorable response (71% vs. 40%, 90% CI 1.3\u201351.5). The authors further described a non-significant reduced 28-day all-cause mortality of 10% with imipenem-relebactam compared with 30% of imipenem and colistin subjects. Notably, CRE specific data demonstrated only one out of four carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales showing a microbiological cure compared with one out of one imipenem and colistin treated subject. Authors attributed microbiologic failure of imipenem-relebactam to organisms harboring several group A and C extended \u03b2-lactamases. The therapeutic niche of imipenem-relebactam remains unclear as it may be used as an additional option for CRE or it may be more useful in treating multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa including those producing carbapenemases [62]. Similarly to ceftazidime-avibactam, the additional pseudomonal coverage may make imipenem-relebactam an appropriate option for empiric therapy in a septic patient with high risk of CRE and pseudomonal infection. Unlike the two previously approved \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors which are recommended to have each dose administered over 2\u20133 h, imipenem-relebactam is given via a 30-min infusion. Shorter infusion durations may be advocated in some institutional settings.",

Cefiderocol is stable and potent against all Ambler group \u03b2-lactamases in vitro, including MBLs, without the addition of a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor [70, 73, 74]. In vivo and healthy volunteer studies have demonstrated adequate tissue concentration into epithelial lining fluid making it a promising therapy in bacterial pneumonia [73, 75]. Cefiderocol responded well against Gram-negative isolates of Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii with a greater than 3 log bacterial growth reduction in a rat lung model. Similar results were seen in an immunocompromised murine thigh infection model with greater than 3 log bacterial growth reduction against various Enterobacterales [74]. Cefiderocol is currently approved for complicated urinary tract infections as it was non-inferior to imipenem in a phase II trial. It is important to note that carbapenem-resistant isolates were excluded from this trial [76]. Cefiderocol is a welcomed novel antimicrobial for a clinician\u2019s repertoire. Not only is this a novel mechanism of delivery, but also it may be one of the first monotherapy agents to effectively treat metallo-\u03b2-lactamase with minimal adverse events. Further clinical development will help determine the exact niche for cefiderocol.",

A potential fail point of this therapy is development of resistance during treatment when used as monotherapy [80]. The USA lags behind a majority of other countries as oral fosfomycin is the only formulation available at this moment; however, an IV formulation is currently under development [81]. Fosfomycin will likely be combined with additional agents for its additive and synergistic effects. Avery and colleagues evaluated combination fosfomycin against various CPE isolates using the E-test method [82].

Historically, the high mortality rates of polymyxins due to poor microbiologic potency and less than optimal drug exposures that have been limited by toxicity have mandated the use of combination therapy in severely ill patients. A large retrospective cohort study evaluated the treatment of bloodstream infections either with monotherapy or combination therapy [83]. Three hundred forty-three subjects were stratified into groups based on severity of illness with a primary endpoint of overall mortality. There were no statistical differences among combined cohorts (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53\u20131.08) and the low mortality score cohort (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.62\u20132.23); however, subjects identified as a high risk of mortality had a statistically significant decrease in overall mortality (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.39\u20130.93). It is important to note the above study did not include novel therapies like BL/BLIs which should take over as the mainstay of CPO therapy. The shift away from using nephrotoxic agents with unpredictable pharmacokinetics has reopened the debate of which agent is superior. There is a growing amount of literature demonstrating ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-relebactam, and meropenem-vaborbactam lead to better treatment outcomes with less adverse events compared with polymyxin best available therapy regimens [49, 52\u201354, 58, 67]. A summary comparing BL/BLI therapy to traditional colistin-based therapy can be seen in Table 3. If an organism is susceptible to a novel \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, then that agent may be considered for monotherapy because these compounds have demonstrated efficacy in the setting of severe infections. Even with novel agents demonstrating superiority over colistin, prescribing habits are slow to change. A recent publication by Clancy and colleagues show that polymyxin and colistin are still the most prescribed antimicrobials for CRE infections which is deeply concerning [84]. Gaining access to novel agents to treat CRE should be a priority for all clinicians as these \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors have been shown to improve outcomes and reduced toxicities relative to polymyxin-based regimens.",

            "text": "Another carbapenemase treatment dogma often overshadowed in literature is when to use empiric therapy which covers carbapenemase. A prospective observational cohort study conducted by Gianella and colleagues evaluated risk factors for development of CRE bloodstream infection from previously colonized subjects and found ICU admission, invasive abdominal procedures, chemotherapy/radiation, and multiple CRE colonization sites independently increased risk [85]. Another study conducted in Israel demonstrated that clinically significant increased risks in carbapenem-resistant colonized patients developing infection were treated with anti-pseudomonal penicillins [86]. In an effort to maximize the probability of early appropriate therapy in patients at risk for resistant pathogens, clinicians need to become increasingly comfortable with the antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetic and toxicodynamic profiles of the novel therapies discussed so that optimal empiric therapy can be initiated at the onset of infection (Fig. 1). Unfortunately a single source of antimicrobial susceptibility data for the agents included in this review is not available and thus comparative assessments based on percent susceptible collated from multiple sources are potentially misleading for CRE due to differing genotypic profiles across the globe. As such, these challenges highlight the importance of local susceptibility testing to determine the most suitable agent(s) for clinical practice in any given region. While the use of novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be warranted in the setting of initial empirical therapy for the septic patient, great effort should be taken to utilize the available diagnostic techniques (i.e., invasive sampling strategies, molecular tests) to identify the causative pathogen(s) and thus allow a rapid, narrow targeted approach to treatment.",

It is of utmost importance that clinicians are familiar with what antimicrobials can be used to treat serious infections like carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales as well as the evolving enzymology associated with these pathogens. With the introduction of new \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors and the improved clinical outcomes associated with these compounds, a shift away from the less efficacious, more toxic polymyxin-based regimens appears completely warranted. While the \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors will play an important role moving forward, other parenteral agents such as plazomicin, fosfomycin, and cefiderocol show great promise and are welcomed options for treating multidrug-resistant organisms.",
