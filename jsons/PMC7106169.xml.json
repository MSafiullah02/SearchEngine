The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the IBV genome encodes two polyproteins (1a and 1ab) that contain proteins necessary for RNA replication, whereas the 3\u2032 one-third encodes several structural proteins: the surface spike glycoprotein (S), and small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. It is generally believed that the S1 subunit of S glycoprotein contains hypervariable regions that play a role in attachment to host receptors, membrane fusion, and entry into the host cell. The S1 subunit of S glycoprotein carries conformationally dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific determinants, and is a determinant of cell tropism. Additional accessory protein genes are located in the 3\u2032 region of the genome in an IBV species-specific position.",

The Massachusetts (Mass) and Connecticut (Conn) strains are two of the most well characterized and important IBV types and were first isolated in the 1930s and 1956, respectively, in the United States of America (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). In addition, Mass-type viruses, which cause heavy economic losses to the poultry industry, have also been detected up to the present time in several European and Asian countries, including China, although at different frequencies (Jackwood, 2012). In contrast, Conn-type viruses, which show only 95.4% of nucleotides homology in the S1 subunit sequence with Mass-type viruses and are in different serotypes from the Mass-type viruses, circulate mainly in the United States of America and Central America (Jackwood, 2012).",

            "text": "Generally, point mutations, insertions, and deletions that occur in the S1 subunit of the spike protein in IBV strains contribute to the existence of many serotypes and the emergence of variants that have been isolated worldwide (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Consequently, genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of IBV are typically focused on the S1 subunit sequence. However, drawing conclusions based on a single gene sequence, and sometimes even a partial gene sequence, requires caution, as the correct molecular phylogeny of viruses can only be demonstrated by analyzing complete genomic sequences because IBV mutates at a high frequency due to the high error rate of RNA polymerization. Like that of other coronaviruses (CoVs), a unique feature of IBV genetics is the high frequency of RNA recombination events in its natural evolution (Liu et al., 2013b). Recombination among CoVs is an attribute of the genus and is thought to contribute to the emergence of new IBV variants (Masters, 2006, Kusters et al., 1989, Wang et al., 1993, Liu et al., 2013b). Recombination events can occur between field strains and also between field and vaccine strains (Masters, 2006, Kusters et al., 1989, Wang et al., 1993, Liu et al., 2013b). In the present study, we isolated an IBV strain, ck/CH/LJL/111054, and performed genomic sequence analysis that revealed evidence of multiple recombination events between Mass- and Conn-like strains. Coupled with the tendency for mutations, our results raise concerns of the likelihood of future outbreaks of new IBV serotypes or variants due to incorrect usage of multiple vaccines and highlights the need for continuous viral surveillance.",

From the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) to genome position 2754 in the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) sequence of strain ck/CH/LJL/111054 showed a much closer relationship and greater nucleotide sequence identity to that of Mass-type H120 than to the Conn strains (Supplementary file 1). However, the ck/CH/LJL/111054 isolate fell into the same group as Conn strains from location 2772 to 3649 in the phylogenetic tree and shared 100% identity with those of the Conn-type, in contrast to 77.4% and 87.6% identities with those of Mass-type H120 vaccine and M41 strains, respectively. It is worth noting that the ck/CH/LJL111054 isolate from position 3657 to 13,332 had a nearly identical sequence (99.9%) to that of H120 and was different from those of the M41 and Conn strains (89.6% and 91.3%, respectively).

Here, we investigated the presence of three recombination breakpoints, two in nsp3 and one in nsp12 (Supplementary files 2 and 3), in which the first recombination breakpoint was confirmed by Simplot analyses (Fig. 2\n). The phylogenetic analysis also showed the same results as the sequence identity analysis using the corresponding gene fragments (Fig. 3\n). These data strongly suggested that ck/CH/LJL/111054 arose from a homologous RNA recombination event from multiple template switches between Mass- and Conn-like viruses. These results implied that template switches occurred within the nsp3 and nsp12 sequences.",

The first recombination breakpoint was confirmed by the Simplot analyses. In addition, we surveyed the whole genome of the three virus strains by using the LAMARC package for calculating the recombination rate. The population recombination rate is 38.77, which is actually a high recombination rate, suggesting the recombinant events happened in the genome of IBV ck/CH/LJL/111054 strain. Like most other RNA viruses, template switching by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases is a mechanism that contributes to genetic recombination events and sequence diversity in coronaviruses (Lai, 1992). In this study, three recombination breakpoints were identified in the genome of ck/CH/LJL/111054 strain, two located within the nsp3 sequence and one within the nsp12 sequence. The recombination events leading to formation of the ck/CH/LJL/111054 sequence can be explained by two models. In the simplest scenario, recombination may have involved only two parental viral strains with RNA replication initiating in a Mass-like template of either negative or positive polarity and then switching of the polymerase-nascent cRNA complex to a Conn-like virus template, followed by double switches in the nsp3 and 12 sequences, respectively. The first switch may have occurred at the beginning of the nsp3 sequence. Alternatively, a more complicated scheme was proposed. In this scheme, a Mass\u2013Conn hybrid arose from a single switch at either of the three or two recombination breakpoints and spread among the chicken flocks and in turn experienced additional recombination events with another Conn-like virus.",

The nsp3 and 5 sequences downstream of the 5\u2032 UTR contain papain-like protein 2 proteases and the main protease, respectively, which cleaves nsp2, 3, 4, and 5\u201316, respectively (Masters, 2006).

It appeared that the emergence of most variants or new IBV types and outbreaks of new diseases are due to the accumulation of mutations in the regions that contain genes important for pathogenicity, especially the spike glycoprotein gene (McKinley et al., 2011). The ck/CH/LJL/111054 isolate likely originated from two vaccines by recombination events; however, the viral genome experienced mutations during its evolution. Although it is difficult to determine which mutation(s) play key roles in pathogenicity, some chickens showed clinical signs after challenge with strain ck/CH/LJL/111054, indicating altered virulence compared with the two possible parental vaccine viruses. However, this observation requires further investigation.",

Due to the unavailability of the Conn-type virus and serum against this type of viruses in our laboratory, we could not serologically identify the antigenic changes in isolate ck/CH/LJL/111054 after recombination and evolution over time, by comparisons with that of Conn-type viruses.",
