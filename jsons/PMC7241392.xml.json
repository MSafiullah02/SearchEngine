In this model, a daily influx of symptomatic COVID-19 patients (based on patterns of predicted epidemiology at that time) entered the hospital system to compete for a pool of fixed healthcare resources. By running the model over the specified time horizon of the pandemic, this model allowed for the estimation of daily ward, ICU, and ventilators use at the provincial level over the course of the pandemic.

In the initial \u201ccrisis\u201d phase of the pandemic, we examined the impact of increasing number of COVID-19 patients under various epidemiological scenarios (expected scenario, worst case, \u201cItaly scenario\u201d, best case, \u201cSouth Korea scenario\u201d),3 entering hospitals, requiring the use of cardiac care resources, such as dedicated cardiac ICU and ward beds, and thereby displacing non-COVID-19 cardiac patients. We used epidemiology scenarios from other countries, as that in Ontario was evolving and not known. Nonetheless, pandemic planning was required and could not be delayed till the Ontario epidemiology became apparent. The model estimated unplanned cardiovascular admissions and waitlist mortality for the three modelled cardiovascular disease states based on the published literature.4 The second phase of our model examined the impact of a policy decision to further curtail elective outpatient procedures (April 5th, 2020) on an increasing waitlist as the Ontario epidemiology became apparent. The third and on-going phase of the model is recovery, as the Ontario COVID-19 pandemic is beyond its peak and currently in a plateau. Our work now focusses on the time required to clear the backlog of outpatient cardiac procedures by modeling various scenarios of the healthcare system\u2019s capacity to perform cardiac procedures relative to baseline volume prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see the Supplementary Appendix for further details of methods and the results for each phase.",

We showed that the potential number of deaths for patients awaiting their elective cardiac procedures would be orders of magnitude less than those who would die of COVID-19 if there was a depletion of critical care resources (Figure 2B). This led to the urgent release of CorHealth COVID-19 Cardiac Memo #7 on April 4th, 2020 to all cardiac hospital CEOs, reinforcing the need for an immediate cessation in all elective outpatient cardiac procedures and surgeries across Ontario.",

However, our model suggested that across five regions of Ontario, there may not be sufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures, if cardiac beds remained allocated to COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C). As such, CorHealth COVID-19 Cardiac Memo #8 was released on April 13th and recommended that cardiac centres could resume scheduled outpatient cardiac procedures, restricted to those at highest risk for mortality based on local resource circumstances. We modeled the impact of resumption of cardiac procedures in mid-April at 50% of baseline volumes followed by normal volumes by early May, specifically on the estimated growth in the waitlist (Figure 2D). The above memorandums are briefly summarized in the Supplementary Table S1 along with the COVID-19 epidemiology at the time of memo release.",

As real-world data is made available, we will be able to validate model outputs against observed outcomes and make iterative improvements to allow for more accurate predictions in the future. This is an important point given the concern for multiple waves of the pandemic in the absence of a vaccine for COVID-19.5 In this first response to the pandemic, the public health mandate was prioritized over other concerns; we recognize that in hindsight, resources were left unused in Ontario. This reinforces the need for prediction models to be improved for the next phase of the pandemic, such that subsequent policy decisions are improved and spillover impacts on non-COVID-19 care is reduced",

The consequences of delaying decisions until local epidemiology data is known with certainty can be catastrophic, as seen in jurisdictions such as Italy and New York, where the systems were overwhelmed. Modelling provides decision makers with a credible envelope of potential future scenarios, to aid with difficult decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario followed this process. Initial worse case scenarios required an immediate and almost complete shift of the healthcare system to care for those critically ill with the virus, at the exclusion of all but the most gravely ill non-COVID-19 patients. Although reasonable in the short term, once local data was known, it required a strategy shift. Understanding the impact of such a policy is crucial in order to understand the cardiac consequences of the decision and to estimate the size of the potential backlog of cardiovascular procedures so that decisions about resumption of activity can be informed. A unique aspect of this model is that COVID-19 patients and cardiovascular patients compete for shared resources. In essence, this explicitly models the fact that policy decisions regarding cardiac patients cannot be made in isolation from the reality of the pandemic and the needs of COVID-19 patients.",

We acknowledge that not every possible scenario can be modeled and there may be important non-fatal outcomes that are relevant to cardiovascular patients that are inadequately represented. Another limitation is that models may be complex and difficult to understand without specialized knowledge or understanding of modeling software.
