On white boards and scraps of paper, researchers sketch hexagons and zigzags, the backbones of molecules. By drawing an additional oxygen atom on one side of a molecule or squeezing a nitrogen group onto the other, for example, chemists try to subtly change the design to make better molecules. Maybe those improvements will knock out a drug's side effects or beef up a material's toughness. But once they are moved from the drawing board into round\u2010bottom flasks, forging and sculpting those modified molecules can take years of trial and error.",

The old flask\u2010based chemistry scheme allowed him to snap fragments of molecules together like Lego building blocks. The method works by forging carbon\u2010carbon bonds between molecular fragments. Each block has a linker. In a chemical reaction, the linkers help bring the two molecular fragments together and connect their carbons.",

            "text": "By adding a compound with a halogen (elements such as bromine and chlorine) as a linker on one side of a molecular fragment and a boronic acid on the other, the building blocks can snap together like train cars. But with two essentially sticky ends on each block there was no way to control which ends were coupling and in what order.\n\nClever caps Using a chemical cap called MIDA, researchers can control the assembly of potential drugs using linkable molecular fragments, shown here as blocks. Each block has a boronic acid linker on one end and a halogen\u2010containing linker on the other. With the removable MIDA cap covering the boronic acid, the blocks can snap together in only one way (left). With no cap, the blocks have two options (right), which is problematic.\n\nHelpful tweaks The antifungal medication amphotericin B, or AmB (left), comes with dangerous side effects, but has been difficult to improve using traditional chemical methods. Some new tricks allow researchers to quickly and easily modify the drug's structure. That work guided the design of two new AmB variants (above), both better at specifically targeting fungus, thus reducing toxicity in mice.\n",
