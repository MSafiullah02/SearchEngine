            "text": "J. Richard Hamilton, MD, FRCPC* Twenty years ago, even the most sophisticated diagnostic facilities could identify a cause of acute diarrhea in only 20 per cent or less of all cases in childhood. Now that figure approaches 80 per cent. 38 By far the most important factor contributing to this remarkable improvement in diagnostic success is the recognition of human rotavirus as the major cause of acute diarrhea in young children. Other viral and bacterial enteric pathogens in man have been identified during these two decades and our understanding of the mechanisms by which some infections cause diarrhea has improved greatly. 24 This new knowledge has provided a sound basis for impressive advances in active therapy and promising approaches to prevention of a problem that annually kills nearly 5 million young children in Mrica, Latin America, and Asia (excluding China). 33 This article, which reviews current concepts of mechanisms and management of viral enteritis, will focus on rotavirus diarrhea and relevant experimental models.",

Serotypes 1 and 3 have emerged as the most frequently identified agents in human cases but the relationships between virulence, host resistance, geographical distribution, and serotype are not clear. Rotavirus serum antibodies can be detected in 90 per cent of 2-year-olds studied in different parts of the world. The extent to which this immune response is protective is not known, but sequential infections with different strains occur in the same child. Also, children with combined immune deficiency can experience serious difficulties in shedding the virus. 13 These agents were reported first in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her Melbourne colleagues who showed a duodenal lesion associated with viral invasion of the intestinal epithelium 4 and massive fecal excretion of virus during acute disease but not during convalescence. 3 Shortly after, infection of a human volunteer, and immune fluorescent studies showing diffuse involvement of the upper intestinal villus epithelium were reported. 41 Most other studies have found a close relationship between rotavirus excretion and acute diarrhea in infants. However, reports from France in which Significant numbers of asymptomatic children were shown to excrete virus in their stools 11 and from Perth, Australia, question the diagnostic meaning of rotavirus sightings in stools of certain populations. 7 Another intriguing observation, made in several centers but not yet fully explained, is fecal excretion of rotavirus particles by asymptomatic newborn infants. 5, 12 Spread of human rotavirus enteritis is human-to-human and presumably fecal-oral. 5 The hardiness of the virus is impressive, in that it retains virulence long after shedding, as evidenced by its apparent capacity to induce nosocomial infections after long periods on hospital furniture, walls, and floors.

Watery diarrhea and cramps begin by the second day, and last for up to 6 days. Fecal output can be massive causing rapid, even fatal dehydration, and acid-base dysequilibrium, Physical signs of dehydration, loss of body weight, decreased skin turgor, sunken fontanelle and eyes may develop before one is aware of diarrhea, because watery stool may pool in the bowel lumen or it may be confused with urine in the diaper, During the acute phase of this illness, auscultation of the abdomen reveals hyperactive bowel sounds, Where severity is difficult to evaluate, rectal examination is particularly helpful, providing an instantaneous assessment of consistency and amount of stool. Examination of those feces usually reveals little if any blood or cellular exudate, but there may be reducing substance. Typically, the disease follows a self-limited course of 4 to 10 days with diarrhea settling by the sixth day or sooner, and subsequentlya gradual return to normal appetite and activity, Laboratory data from severely affected patients show a raised fecal Na+ concentration with isotonic dehydration and reduced plasma bicarbonate levels. The severely affected child, particularly an infant, may develop lethal hypernatremia or hyponatremia with marked acidosis, If the child has been receiving hyperosmolar drinks (commercial beverages, gelatin water, fruit juices undiluted) or solutions of very high salt content (certain commercially prepared soups, milk that has been boiled for an extended time), the likelihood ofhypernatremia is increased. 56 Standard hematologic indices may be distorted by dehydration and in some cases serum transaminase activity is increased slightly.",

At the height ofTGE diarrhea, several functional abnormalities have been identified, each of which could contribute to excessive fecal salt and water losses. Brush border membrane disaccharidase activities are decreased as is the function of the basolateral membrane Na pump, the Na-K-ATPase system. The dominant transport defect appears to be a marked reduction in Na gradient-dependent glucose absorption across the intestinal brush border, but neutral NaCI absorption at this site is decreased also. 34 Absence of a functional high affinity brush border membrane glucose carrier seems to contribute to this diminished Na-facilitated glucose absorption. 29 It is of interest that alanine-Na co transport may be only partially impaired in this acute viral diarrhea. 47, 48 Furthermore, there is no evidence of intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP or GMP and no evidence of an active secretory process, such as one would encounter in cholera. 34 We believe that this functional profile of the small intestine in acute TeE diarrhea, which is in keeping with current concepts of the profile of normal intestinal crypt cell function, applies to rotavirus enteritis. In TeE enteritis, virus has been shed from the mucosa by the time diarrhea becomes severe; this relationship may not apply fully to rotavirus disease in that rotavirus continues to be shed in stools during acute diarrhea.",

For the child with a secretory bacterial toxin-induced diarrhea (for example, Escherichia coli, cholera), this solution theoretically promotes absorption of glucose facilitated Na absorption to compensate for secretory losses. For the child with viral diarrhea, it provides a balanced (equimolar glucose and Na) mixture of ions in an isotonic solution to make the best possible use of any absorptive capacity remaining in the sick intestine. It is important to recognize that this solution will not lessen diarrhea directly nor does it provide significant nutrition to the child.

The exception seems to be among some aboriginal people, where lactose is poorly tolerated even in health, but especially in the face of small intestinal disease.",

Although vaccines are not yet available, it is clear that improved hygienic practices, particularly in pediatric institutions, and breast feeding can do much to prevent serious illness during the early months when babies are so vulnerable. During the past decade, from clinical studies and animal models, much has been learned about the pathogenesis of rotavirus diarrhea. These findings provide",
