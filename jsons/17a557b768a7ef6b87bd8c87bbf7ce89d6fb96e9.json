Methods: The Korea Histiocytosis Working Party retrospectively analyzed data on 251 pediatric patients diagnosed with HLH between 1996 and 2011. Results: In the study cohort, 25 cases were categorized with familial HLH, 64 with presumed secondary HLH, and 162 with unspecified HLH. Of 217 evaluable patients, 91 (42%) had concomitant Epstein-Barr virus infection. Of 238 evaluable patients, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which was more frequent in the familial group, was evident in 81 cases (34%). Genetic tests revealed a predominant UNC13D mutation with a high incidence of two recurrent splicing mutations (c.118-308C>T and c.754-1G>C). The 5-yr overall survival rate was 68% (38% in the familial group and 81% in the presumed secondary group). The 5-yr overall survival rate among 32 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 64%. In multivariate analysis, a younger age at diagnosis, severe transaminasemia, and a coagulation abnormality were independent prognostic factors for survival. Responses during initial treatments were also significant indicators of outcome. Conclusion: Our study showed the unique predominance of a UNC13D mutation and vulnerability to Epstein-Barr virus infection in Korean children with HLH and emphasizes the prognostic significance of age, liver dysfunction, and treatment responses in this disease.

Interestingly, the most commonly mutated gene for FHL in the neighboring countries of Korea, Japan and China is PRF1 (26, 27) . Two recurrent splicing mutations-c.118-308C>T and c.754-1G>C-were found in nearly three-quarters of the patients in our current study cohort, which suggest the presence of founder effects of these mutations in the development of HLH in Korea (10) . In contrast, c.1596 + 1G>C, the most common mutation in Japanese FHL3 patients, and c.2346_2349delGGAG and c.753 + 1G>T, the most common mutations in European FHL3 patients, were not found in our series, which suggest a geographic or ethnic specificity of the mutations causing each FHL subtype (28, 29) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 167, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 277, "end": 280, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 281, "end": 284, "text": "26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 404, "end": 408, "text": "(26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 409, "end": 412, "text": "27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 657, "end": 661, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "(28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 964, "end": 967, "text": "29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A B"}, {"text": "Our current analyses showed a 5-yr OS rate of 68%, which is comparable with previous studies (4, 5) .

Limitations of this retrospective study include the incompleteness of testing for STXBP2 mutation and the absence of testing for mutations in SH2D1A, XIAP/BIRC4, and ITK, which was why we adopted the term 'presumed' secondary HLH for the patients without mutations in UNC13D, PRF1, and STX11. This leaves the possibility of the presence of cryptic genetic mutation in the patients designated as having presumed secondary HLH, thus requiring cautious interpretation of our results. Another limitation of the present study is that a larger portion of patients, who were enrolled during early period of the study, has not been tested for genetic mutation and was thus designated as having unspecified HLH. There are no reliable clinical criteria to distinguish familial and secondary HLH. Therefore, we could not further define the patients with HLH without genetic evaluation or family history, even though they were reported to have possible triggering causes. Albeit these limitations, our observations of discrete clinical features between familial and presumed secondary groups and prognostic factors evaluated in our overall cohort could provide clinical implications for a future research agenda.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A B"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our current analyses have revealed a unique genetic susceptibility to FHL3 and vulnerability to EBV infection in Korean children with HLH. Age, liver dysfunction, and treatment response were found to be significant indicators of a poor prognosis. Serial monitoring of changes in the ferritin levels during the initial treatment of HLH may enable the disease status to be followed and allow for the prediction of treatment outcomes, thus helping to identify the subgroup of patients who need more intensive treatment. A multicenter prospective trial is warranted to identify the subgroups of patients with HLH with poor prognoses and find optimal treatment for these cases.
