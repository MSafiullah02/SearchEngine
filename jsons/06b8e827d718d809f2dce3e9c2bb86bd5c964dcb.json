The high-quality organic thin films and coatings derived from the aforementioned solvent-free and low-temperature process have found applications across a wide range of fields. [1] In a recent example, CVD-synthesized metal-organic covalent network (MOCN) thin films were demonstrated to display highly selective gas permeation and hence are excellent candidates for gas-separation membranes. [5] The surface energy modification enabled by CVD polymerization can create both hydrophilic anti-fouling surfaces [6] [7] [8] and hydrophobic icephobic/anti-hydrate surfaces. [9] [10] [11] [12] Hydrophobic CVD polymers were also employed to enhance steam condensation efficiency. [13] CVD polymer functional surfaces have found utility in the fields of biomass extraction [14] and drug delivery. [15] In addition to the aforementioned applications, defect-free CVD insulating, semiconducting, and insulating polymers have proved valuable in the fabrication of organic electronic devices. [1, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Among various CVD polymerization techniques, two distinct solvent-free CVD polymerization processes, initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) and oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD), have been developed by Gleason and co-workers. [1, 16, 20, 21] In an iCVD process, volatile monomer(s) (e.g., acrylates) and an initiator (e.g., tert-butyl peroxide, TBPO) flow into the vacuum chamber which has temperature controlled chamber walls and substrates. The initiator is then broken apart to form radicals by thermal decomposition, [8] UV radiation [22] or plasma initiation. [5] These radicals subsequently react with absorbed monomers on the cooled substrate to initiate the radical polymerization (chain growth mechanism) and form CVD polymers. In an oCVD process, the volatile monomer(s) (e.g., thiophene) and oxidant (e.g., iron III chloride) are introduced into the temperature controlled vacuum chamber followed by step-growth polymerization of conductive CVD polymers on the substrates. [23] Aside from the iCVD and oCVD processes, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), parylene CVD, molecular layer deposition (MLD), vapor deposition polymerization (VDP) and vapor phase polymerization (VPP) are additional common CVD polymerization processes. [1, 16, 20, 21, 24] PECVD and parylene CVD occur via a chain growth mechanism (radical polymerization), while in MLD, VDP and VPP, the monomers undergo a step-growth mechanism (condensation polymerization).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 263, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 476, "end": 479, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 592, "end": 595, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 596, "end": 599, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 600, "end": 603, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 653, "end": 656, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 657, "end": 661, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 662, "end": 666, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 667, "end": 671, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 850, "end": 854, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 874, "end": 878, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1069, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1074, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1079, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1089, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1094, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1099, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1342, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1346, "text": "16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1350, "text": "20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1354, "text": "21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1637, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1655, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1681, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2101, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2371, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2372, "end": 2375, "text": "16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2379, "text": "20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2383, "text": "21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2384, "end": 2387, "text": "24]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization directly synthesizes organic thin films on a substrate from vapor phase reactants. Dielectric, semiconducting, electrically conducting, and ionically conducting CVD polymers have all been readily integrated into devices. The absence of solvent in the CVD process enables the growth of high-purity layers and avoids the potential of dewetting phenomena, which lead to pinhole defects. By limiting contaminants and defects, ultrathin (<10 nm) CVD polymeric device layers have been fabricated in multiple laboratories. The CVD method is particularly suitable for synthesizing insoluble conductive polymers, layers with high densities of organic functional groups, and robust crosslinked networks. Additionally, CVD polymers are prized for the ability to conformally cover rough surfaces, like those of paper and textile substrates, as well as the complex geometries of micro-and nanostructured devices. By employing low processing temperatures, CVD polymerization avoids damaging substrates and underlying device layers. This report discusses the mechanisms of the major CVD polymerization techniques and the recent progress of their applications in devices and device fabrication, with emphasis on initiated CVD (iCVD) and oxidative CVD (oCVD) polymerization.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "(2 of 20) 1604606", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Differences in polymerization mechanisms have implications for which monomers can be employed with a specific process and hence the types of polymers can be formed by a given approach.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In a PECVD process, monomers are fragmented by plasma to form a variety of radical species. The resulting thin films are often highly crosslinked, [25] and thus can be mechanically and thermally robust. However, the properties of the PECVD films can also be negatively impacted by the loss of desirable organic functional groups and by defect formation resulting from the plasma fragmentation. [26] For example, recently it has been demonstrated that PECVD films displayed reduced photo-stability as compared to that of iCVD films grown using the same monomer. [25] Instead of using a plasma as the energy source, parylene CVD employs heat to crack vapor phase reactants related to [2, 2] paracyclophane. Polymerization of the resulting radical species on cooled substrates proceeds via a chain growth mechanism. [27] By varying the functional groups attached to the [2, 2] paracyclophane, polymer films with high retention of functionality can be produced via the parylene CVD process and an impressive range of applications has been demonstrated. [27] [28] [29] [30] In the MLD [31] and VDP [32] processes, bifunctional monomers are necessary to participate in condensation polymerization. The resulting polymers generally fall into a distinctly different class of chemical structures from macromolecules grown by free radical means. Unlike VDP, in which multiple monomer species flow into the reactor simultaneously, in MLD, flows of different monomers are alternated under conditions where growth is self-limited. The VPP process was occasionally termed as VDP process in some literature. [24] In this report, we use VPP to refer to a process related to the oCVD process for forming conjugated polymer thin films. While, both VPP and oCVD utilize vapor phase monomers, the difference is that in VPP, a low-volatility oxidant is applied to the substrate as a solid, whereas a vapor phase oxidant is employed in oCVD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 151, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 394, "end": 398, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 561, "end": 565, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 686, "end": 688, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 813, "end": 817, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 867, "end": 870, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 871, "end": 873, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1053, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1097, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1597, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "It should be noted that the CVD polymerization techniques are distinctively different from the thermal-or laserbased physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes (e.g., matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation, MAPLE) for polymeric film formation.

[35] Organic devices, including displays and photovoltaics, have been are produced by traditional solution processes. This approach requires significant interfacial optimization to avoid dewetting behavior that leads to pinhole defects and thus limits the ability to produce ultrathin films. Additionally, it is challenging to achieve conformality (i.e., to have the same film thickness over all the features of a geometrically complex device) via solution-based method. [17] Conformal coverage is particularly important for device structures having high-aspect-ratio features, including nanostructured devices such as 3D batteries and ultracapacitors. [20, 36] A second issue within the solution-based processing methods is the limited solubility or complete insolubility of some target polymers. Indeed, to enhance the solubility of these polymers, additional synthetic modifications to attach pendant groups to the target structures are commonly practiced, which increase the complexity of device fabrication. [20] These are two of the factors have limited the application of solution-based methods in the field of device fabrication.

[1, 16, 20, 21] These CVD processes provide excellent compatibility to a wide range of substrates since there is no potential for solvent or plasma damage of the underlying material. The absence of wettability and surface tension renders CVD \"substrate independent\", meaning that modification of the process is not required for each different substrate. This substrate independence reduces device fabrication complexity and expands the applicability of the CVD method to novel substrates. The solvent-free nature also assures minimal dewetting and essentially pinhole free CVD polymer films. [37] CVD polymer composition and crosslinking can be systematically tuned by introducing co-monomers, which can further optimize device performance and enhance the device durability and stability. In addition, avoiding toxic organic solvents can lead to cost reduction and greener chemistry, while avoiding the problem of having residual solvent in the device layers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 471, "end": 474, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 475, "end": 478, "text": "16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 479, "end": 482, "text": "20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 483, "end": 486, "text": "21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1067, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 458, "end": 468, "text": "(Figure 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "CVD Polymers for Organic Devices and Device Fabrication"}, {"text": "A second major advantage of the CVD polymerization is its conformal deposition with excellent thickness control. For electronic or sensing devices having high-aspect-ratio features, conformal coatings are crucial to enable a consistent performance and to avoid the failure of the device. A third advantage of CVD polymerization is the low temperature involved in the polymerization process. This characteristic allows direct deposition of polymer thin films on fragile substrates (e.g., papers, fabrics) without additional steps (e.g., transfer). [38, 39] In addition, the versatility in the CVD precursor choices and the ability to fully retain functionality of precursors in the final CVD polymers allow the technique to be integrated into a large selection of device fabrication processes. Last but not the least, it should be noted that CVD polymerization can also be scaled up for commercialization via large area batch and roll-to-roll processes.

Devices and Device Fabrication"}, {"text": "Oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) is an efficient method to synthesize conjugated polymers including, but not limited to, polythiophene, polypyrrole, and polyselenophene. [1] The process of oCVD has been well described previously. [1] In a typical oCVD process, vapors of the oxidant (e.g., FeCl 3 ) and the monomers (EDOT, thiophene, etc) are simultaneously introduced into a vacuum chamber. The polymer synthesis takes place on a substrate affixed to a temperature controlled stage, where the precursors adsorb from the vapor phase. oCVD has the advantages of being solvent-free, easily tailored, utilizes low operational temperatures, and produces conformal coatings on ultrafine structures. [1] In addition, utilizing conjugated monomers to which functional groups have been added, the oCVD technique is capable of introducing various functional groups into electrically conducting polymer. [44, 75] The added functional groups can be used for covalently tethering sensing elements (e.g., metal nanoparticles, [43] proteins, [76, 77] etc), and therefore provide a versatile platform for chemical and biological sensing. Together with the electrical conducting nature of oCVD films, all of these advantages make oCVD technique a very powerful tool for fabricating chemical and biological detectors based on responses in electrical resistance. Such resistive sensing is desired for applications in which low cost and low weight are essential. Initiative chemical vapor deposition (iCVD), [1] a technique introduced in previous sections, is also a very useful tool in chemical and biological sensing. As a vapor phase polymerization technique, iCVD is also capable of synthesizing conformal coatings on nanostructures. [1, 56] Based on the physical properties of the coating layer, iCVD polymers can function as selective layers for gas sensors. [18] Furthermore, polymers containing useful functional groups for sensing element attachment can also be easily achieved using iCVD technique. [56] By providing a filter layer or a docking location for sensing elements such as DNA primers, the iCVD technique also finds wide applications in chemical/biological detection. [56] The utility of oCVD and iCVD for chemical sensing has been demonstrated for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detection at room temperature. VOCs are widely known as safety hazards for industrial plants, particularly in oil refineries. [44] Among all the possible sensor types, chemiresistors, sensors displaying resistive response after exposure to an analyte, are one of the best candidates for integration onto printed circuit boards and into wireless networks. However, traditional metal oxide chemiresistive sensors require high operational temperatures (200-400 \u00b0C). The energy consumption of the required heating elements [44] is a significant barrier for integration into a wireless sensor network. A variety of chemiresistive sensing strategies for ambient temperature VOC detection have been demonstrated using oCVD and iCVD techniques. By avoiding the need for a heating element and the associated energy use, these CVD polymer-based sensors pave the way for integration into wireless sensor networks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 183, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 240, "end": 243, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 704, "end": 707, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 904, "end": 908, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 909, "end": 912, "text": "75]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[76,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1046, "text": "77]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1502, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1732, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1736, "text": "56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1860, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2004, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2183, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2424, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2817, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Chemical and Biological Sensing"}, {"text": "Sreeram et al.

For this reason, high-surface-area carbon materials, such as nanoporous structures or aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) have been investigated as potential electrodes. The overall capacitance of these devices can be increased via conductive polymer (CP) coatings on the electrode surface. Instead of confining charges only to the surface of carbon allotrope electrodes, they can also be stored throughout the volume of the CP as seen in Figure 3f , thus increasing the pseudocapacitance of the device. [47] Given the need for excellent conformal coverage of architectures at the sub-micrometer or even nanoscale level, a vaporbased polymerization method is ideal for coatings of CP.

[17] The films exhibited excellent insulating properties with low tunneling-limited leakage characteristics. This was attributed to the low defect density of the pV3D3 films, which was resulted from iCVD's solvent-free nature eliminated the potential for any solvent residues. iCVD's ability to fabricate ultrathin layers, down to sub-10 nm of pinhole-free and uniform thinness, allows high capacitance density of the insulating layers to be achieved. Thus the iCVD pV3D3 films were proposed as highcapacitance gate dielectric for field-effect transistors (FETs). Subsequently in this work, iCVD pV3D3 was grown on a plastic substrate and a variety of channel layers as gate dielectrics to yield flexible FETs (e.g., Figure 4b inset) . The devices exhibit ideal, hysteresis-free transfer characteristics and consistently low gate leakage current, as shown in Figure 4b . Following up the pV3D3 homopolymer work, Im and co-workers have further modified the pV3D3 thin film by surface treatment. [55] Oxygen plasma treatment were used to form a molecular-thin oxide capping layer, onto which self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) were tethered by applying silane-based reagents. The capping layer enhances the thermal stability of the dielectrics and provides reactive sites for subsequent silanization. The SAM improves the interface between the dielectric and the pentacene channel layer. As a result, the thin-film transistors (TFTs) with SAM-treated pV3D3 gate dielectric, exhibited substantially higher field-effect mobility and on-off ratio. Recently, the library of iCVD dielectrics was extended to three new polymers: pEGDMA, pIBA, and pPFDA. [60] All exhibited low leakage currents under the condition of being flexed, and were demonstrated as gate dielectric layers for hysteresis-free, low-voltage TFTs. In addition to being used as gate dielectrics, iCVD pV3D3 has also been explored as an encapsulation layer by itself or in conjunction with other materials, due to its long-term stability as well as aforementioned mechanical flexibility and electrical insulation properties. iCVD pV3D3 was first demonstrated to be suitable for use in electrically insulating neural recording array. [84] Its high electrical resistivity allows films as thin as 5 \u00b5m to serve as electrical insulation layer for this application. Moreover, it displayed resistance to hydrolysis at elevated temperature and a variety of solvents. In addition, the electrical properties of pV3D3 films exhibit long-term stability over 2.5 years under simulated implant conditions. Having shown its potential as biopassivation layer, iCVD films were further hybridized with inorganic thin films synthesized via PECVD, ALD, and HWCVD to produce barrier layers to vapor transmission. [54, 65, 85, 86] The hybrid films have the advantages of both inorganic and organic films, displaying low vapor transmission and good mechanical flexibility. Coclite et al. synthesized a type of hybrid film by combining PECVD and iCVD in a single-chamber process. [65] The same precursor, HVDSO, was used to produce a multilayer stack composed of SiO x -like layer via PECVD and pHVDSO layer via iCVD. The hybridization was achieved by alternating the polymerization mechanisms. Water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) of 0.01 g m -2 per day at 28 \u00b0C, 98% RH were obtained, which represents a barrier improvement factor of 100 over the single SiO x -like layer. iCVD pV4D4 has also been hybridized with Al 2 O 3 deposited by ALD for encapsulation of organic electronic Adv.

A network made of nanoparticles affords provides a large surface area for energy harvesting devices. However, solution-based methods to infiltrate the network with gel-polymer electrolytes often results in reduced nanoparticle loading. To increase nanoparticle loading, Hsieh et al. have demonstrated that polyglycidol (pGL) is able to be uniformly grown on mesoporous layers of TiO 2 nanoparticle networks (TNN) using iCVD. [69] Unlike the typical free radical polymerizations used by iCVD, a cationic ring opening polymerization of PGL has been enabled by using boron-trifluoride-based initiators. A conformal PGL coating attained 91% pore space filling through the cationic ring opening polymerization. This enables pGL nanocomposites with high TiO 2 -nanoparticle loading of 82 wt% and a corresponding glass transition temperature (T g ) increase by 50-60 \u00b0C compared to the bulk PGL polymer. As Figure 6c illustrates, the large T g increase is attributed to strong hydrogen bonding interactions among hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 surface, pGL hydroxyl groups, and pGL ether groups. These strong interactions enable polymer nanocomposites with high nanoparticle loading which is necessary for high-performance energy devices. iCVD synthesis of other polymer electrolyte chemistries for DSSCs have also been studied. Janakiraman et al. have investigated the reaction kinetics of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (pVP) and poly(4-vinylpyridine) (p4VP) synthesis via iCVD, by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. [67] Based on the outcomes from the previous research, Smolin et al. has completed the application of iCVD-processed poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA), poly(glycidyl meth-acrylate) (pGMA), and p4VP to DSSCs as polymeric electrolytes. [106] As the data in Figure 6d show, each polymer's performance as electrolyte in DSSCs has been studied theoretically and experimentally. 1D first-principles macroscopic DSSC mathematical modelling has verified that the polymer's pendant groups greatly impacts the conduction band position of TiO 2 , the back electron transfer at. Calculations show the difference between the conduction band and the electrolyte redox potential are 1.06, 0.99, and 0.87 eV for pHEMA, pGMA, and p4VP respectively. The estimated recombination rate constants for P4VP and PGMA are 54 and 19% lower than that of PHEMA respectively. Finally, this study confirms that DSSC performance characteristics such as open-circuit voltage (V OC ), J SC , and FF can be manipulated by employing different polymer electrolytes. [106] The studies fulfilled by Perrotta et al. and Kim et al. have demonstrated that iCVD polymers can also play a key role as organic encapsulation barriers to prevent O 2 and moisture permeation into organic electronic devices. [85, 107] To prove the moisture and O 2 permeation barrier properties of the organic interlayers fabricated by iCVD, both studies have measured water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) by carrying out a calcium test. There is a clear correlation between WVTR and defect density, although the correlation based on calcium test data is not perfectly fit. The smaller defect density and the lower WVTR show that iCVD is an effective surface modification technique to strengthen moisture and O 2 permeation barrier properties.

Direct-printing of electronic features is attractive due to their rapid rate, material flexibility, and lower cost in equipment and operation. Several well-established methods, including screen, gravure (intaglio), flexographic (relief), and inkjet printing have been adapted to pattern electronic materials with high throughput, yet their resolution (minimum feature size) is limited to \u224820 \u00b5m. [110] Flexography in principle may achieve printed features matching the stamp geometry, by loading the liquid ink directly on the upraised stamp structures and relief transfer under contact. [111, 112] These direct-printing technologies also leverage advances in functional inks including metallic and semiconductor colloidal solutions which are key to applications including thin-film transistors and transparent electrodes for use in large-area displays, touchscreen devices, and solar panels. Although elastomeric stamps can easily be fabricated with micrometer-scale and smaller features, the liquid transfer between two solid surfaces is prone to liquid spreading, which prevents the transfer of uniform, thin layers for feature sizes smaller than 20-50 \u00b5m. [113] Wettability control of such porous nanostructures is needed to fully utilize the high surface area associated in such structures. The conformality of the CVD polymers offers a unique way of controlling the wettability of porous nanomaterials. One of the widely-researched porous nanomaterials is CNTs. The CVD synthesis of vertically aligned CNTs (VA-CNTs) [114] using lithographically-patterned catalyst films directly creates bulk microstructures with tunable electrical and mechanical properties as well as high porosity (>99%). [37, 115, 116] The large surface area of VA-CNTs with combined control of microscale geometry and nanoscale porosity is beneficial for their applications in batteries [117] and supercapacitors, [118] surface wettability control, [119] and liquid ink direct contact printing. [114] However, as the spacing between the individual CNTs decreases and the resulting aspect ratio increases, the surface area per unit volume also increases significantly. Thus, the VA-CNTs become increasingly influenced by surface forces, such as capillary forces when exposed to liquids. Figure 7a shows SEM images of the as-made patterned VA-CNT micropillars (left) and after their wetting and subsequent drying with low-surface-tension dimethoxyethane liquid (right). This aggregation and densification process in nano/micro filaments due to exposure to liquids, also referred to as elastocapillary self-assembly, has been used as a fabrication step to enhance the functionality of CNTs for applications in microelectonics, interconnects, MEMS devices, micro sensors, trapping devices, bioprobes, and energy-storage devices. [120] For example, De Volder et al. have demonstrated an enhancement in the mechanical robustness of the CNTs through capillary densification (100-fold enhancment in the Young's modulus) and have developed 3D microstructures as molds for mass production of 3D polymer structures. [121] Despite these advances, elastocapillary densification and shrinkage from surface tension forces applied during liquid infiltration and evaporation, [120] have precluded the application of VA-CNT forest porosity in liquid environments.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 607, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 794, "end": 799, "text": "[111,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 800, "end": 804, "text": "112]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1371, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1734, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1908, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1913, "text": "115,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1918, "text": "116]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2076, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2103, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2138, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2184, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3009, "end": 3014, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3289, "end": 3294, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3443, "end": 3448, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2470, "end": 2479, "text": "Figure 7a", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Advanced Printing"}, {"text": "Recently, the elastocapillary densification of the CNTs was prevented by conformal deposition of an ultrathin protective layer of poly(perfluorodecylacrylate), poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecylacrylate) (pPFDA), a low surface energy polymer, on the CNTs via iCVD [122] Uniformity and conformality of the pPFDA deposition via iCVD on the CNT micropillars has been confirmed by the SEM-EDX mapping of the coated CNT micropillars (Figure 7a ). Polymer coating via the vapor-based and solvent-less iCVD method has also been studied to form polymeric duplicates of rose petal structures. [123] Lau et al. took a bio-inspired approach to the problem of developing superhydrophobic surfaces using iCVD thorugh mimicking designs found in nature.

[38, 117] oCVD can generate higher resolution patterns than VPP that relies on the solvent casting of oxidants because oCVD delivers both of oxidant and EDOT vapors. [38] Micro-stencils made from the elastomeric material poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) created bio-functional square patterns of pyrolysis generated polycyclophane with \u2248150 \u00b5m size on a thermoplastic substrate enabling the good sealing between the mask and substrate. [73] To achieve higher resolution features, photolithography using an optical mask becomes the most reliable process to achieve fine patterns in the semiconductor industry. One of the current challenges is to shrink feature sizes down to sub-10 nm in a cost-effective way. Therefore, development of highly sensitive, chemically homogeneous, and ultrathin photo resist films has been of interest. Zhou et al. demonstrated ultrathin polyurea resist films deposited by mol ecular layer deposition (MLD) for the first time. [71, 125] The selflimiting nature of MLD enabled the control of the thickness, stoichiometric compositions, and placement of functional moieties. MLD exactly placed photoacid generator (PAG), a chemical amplifier, within the MLD polyurea films allowing the uniform distribution of PAG within photoresist films thick of sub-10 nm. In a separate work, a highly sensitive e-beam resist was developed by polyurea films with MLD for sub-50 nm patterning. [126] The elimination of the aromatic components in the MLD films prevents the 30 nm thick polyurea films from cross-linking under e-beam exposure, thereby producing higher resolution patterns (\u224840 nm) with sub-100 C cm -2 exposure. Petruczok et al. reported that iCVD achieved the Cr/Au patterns on curved substrates with the combination of iCVD poly(4-vinyl pyridine) and post-soaking the films with a photoactive molecule. [124] For this geometry of substrate, the traditional method of applying resist to by spin coating would be challenging. In further work, UV-light-responsive poly(vinyl cinnamate) was iCVD copolymerized with temperature responsive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) for reversible patterning. [74] Yet another strategy is using pre-patterns of an inhibitor or oxidant prior to the deposition. [30, [61] [62] [63] 70, 127, 128] The pre-patterns of transition metal (or salts) delayed the film growth selectively in iCVD, while pre-patterns of Fe (III) tosylate Fe(Tos) 3 composites, as an oxidant, promoted the deposition in VPP. The Gupta group published a series of papers on selective iCVD with the pre-patterns of transition metal salts such as CuCl 2 and Cu(NO 3 ) 2 . [61] [62] [63] They formed the pre-patterns by spin-casting or spay-coating with transition salt solutions before iCVD. They investigated some combinations of several transition metal salts and polymers to evaluate the inhibition effect and observed that metal cations affect the ability to inhibit the polymer deposition. [63] This approach enabled the selective deposition of fluoropolymers on porous structures such as papers. They further demonstrated a paper-based microfluidic device with the patterned fluoropolymer barriers. The barriers allowed the containment of organic solvents within the paper-based device so that it can detect water insoluble analytes in the solvents. [62] For the inhibition effect of transition metal salts, they examined the changes in the oxidation state of metals during the iCVD process and concluded that the salts quenched the propagating radicals which led a reduction of the oxidation states of the metal. [61] In addition to such transition metal composites, it was recently reported that applying the electrical charge to metals can inhibit the growth of PPX films via VPP and enhance the inhibition effect, irrespective of the substituted functionality. [70] Wu and co-workers effectively inhibited the deposition of parylene C and aldehyde-functionalized PPX on metal substrates supplying an electrical charge, while the growth inhibition of both films failed with no electrical charge. They explained that supplying electrical energy to the substrate increases the transition of the surface energy, thus reducing the sticking coefficient by one order of magnitude for a substrate: for example, iron. [70] Micropatterned self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on a gold substrate by microcontact printing (\u00b5CP) can also inhibit the growth of functional paracyclophane films. [30] Gall et al. demonstrated that the different chain groups of SAMs have Adv. Mater. 2017, 29, 1604606 www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advmat.de different abilities to inhibit the film growth; CH 3 -terminated SAMs inhibited effectively, while COOH-and OH-terminated SAMs did not. [30] In contrast, the pre-patterns of oxidants can encourage the selective growth of PEDOT films by VPP. Two techniques contributed to printing the oxidant inks: dip-pen lithography (DPN) and inkjet printing. [127, 128] In both techniques patterned oxidant inks with unique compositions were formed on substrates prior to introducing vapors of monomer.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 515, "end": 519, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 520, "end": 524, "text": "117]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 681, "end": 685, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 948, "end": 952, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1472, "text": "[71,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1477, "text": "125]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1923, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2344, "end": 2349, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2631, "end": 2635, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2731, "end": 2735, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2736, "end": 2740, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2741, "end": 2745, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2746, "end": 2750, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2754, "text": "70,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2759, "text": "127,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2760, "end": 2764, "text": "128]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3111, "end": 3115, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3116, "end": 3120, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3121, "end": 3125, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3434, "end": 3438, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3795, "end": 3799, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4059, "end": 4063, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4310, "end": 4314, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4758, "end": 4762, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4926, "end": 4930, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5209, "end": 5213, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5418, "end": 5423, "text": "[127,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5424, "end": 5428, "text": "128]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 385, "text": "Mater. 2017, 29, 1604606", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 433, "end": 457, "text": "Mater. 2017, 29, 1604606", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 5006, "end": 5030, "text": "Mater. 2017, 29, 1604606", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Patterning"}, {"text": "The key for successful selective deposition of PEDOT via the techniques is unique oxidant inks compatible to each printing technique.
