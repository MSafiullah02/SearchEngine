Moreover, the possible long-term effects of neonatal diarrhea on the health and performance of calves that survive clinical episodes might constitute an even greater loss (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986b; Warnick et al., 1995).",

Faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum in sterile plastic bottles and submitted on the day of sampling to the laboratory by express mail. Submitted samples were accompanied by a record sheet containing information on the size of herd, number of scouring calves and number of calves less than 30 days old in the herd at sampling time, and age of each sampled calf. Only faecal samples obtained within 48 h of onset of clinical signs from non-treated calves up to 30 days of age were included in this study. Samples were processed within 24 h of reception.",

The gels were assembled using a mini-Protean II cell (BioRad) and run with a 50 mA running current and constant voltage for 1.5 h using a 200/2.0 model power supply (BioRad).

            "text": "In microbiological surveys of diarrheic and healthy calves, mixed infections were much more commonly detected in diarrheic than in healthy calves (Morin et al., 1980; Reynolds et al., 1986). Reynolds et al. (1986)suggested that the presence of more than one enteropathogen may be one of the factors determining whether an infection results in a clinical or subclinical presentation. On the other hand, mixed infections may be associated with more severe disease (Morin et al., 1980). The detection rate of mixed infections with two or more enteropathogens found by us (28%) is higher than that reported by others in surveys involving diarrheic calves carried out in different countries (range from 5 to 20%) (Bulgin et al., 1982; Sherwood et al., 1983; Reynolds et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986; Bellinzoni et al., 1990; Zrelli et al., 1990). The high detection rate of mixed infections in this study may be due to the biased submission of severe diarrheas. In this study, the most common mixed infection was rotavirus\u2013Cryptosporidium: more than 20% of the calves excreted rotavirus at the same time as Cryptosporidium. This is in agreement with the results published in most surveys all over the world.",

Negative results may be explained because some cases of diarrhea might not be associated with infectious agents (but due instead to nutritional or other management factors), because the detection methods missed some positive stools (especially when low or intermittent shedding of pathogens occurred), or because other non-investigated pathogens were involved. Many other enteric bacteria (such as enteropathogenic E. coli that cause attaching and effacing lesions in the intestines of calves) and viruses (especially calicivirus and Breda virus) have also been associated with the disease, but their role as causative agents of calf diarrhea (or their relative importance) is not well defined.",

That could at least partially explain the ELISA false-positive results. However, it is also possible that these results are true false-positive or even that the ELISA sensitivity was higher than that of PAGE. Only three of the 83 PAGE-positive samples were negative by the ELISA; however, two of these samples showed a B electrophoretype by PAGE and, thus, could not be detected by ELISA since the test detects only group-A rotavirus.
