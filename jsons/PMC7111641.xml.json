Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and \u201cbouncing back\u201d in the face of adversity.

Indeed, for those whose baseline functioning was low before the adverse event, the measurement of good function after the event may be evidence for thriving not resilience. Thriving is commonly defined as not solely returning to a normal level of function (as for resilience) but achieving a higher level of functioning.5, 26 Therefore, the concept of thriving is different and its place in the resilience spectrum should be considered further and clarified.",
