Pandemics are typically associated with influenza A virus strains harboring a novel form of the hemagglutinin molecule (19) . In March 2009, infections caused by a new swine-origin influenza A \u2044 H1N1 virus were diagnosed in Mexico and the United States (4). In June 2009, the World Health Organization declared influenza pandemic. Autopsy and epidemiological studies showed some differences between seasonal and pandemic influenza infections (19) . Age at the death was younger than in the seasonal form, as in our case (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Immunologic protection induced by prior exposure to previously circulating A \u2044 H1N1 viruses (5) is likely to explain this age difference. Up to 91% of the patients had preexisting medical conditions, including cardiac or respiratory diseases, immunosuppression, pregnancy, and obesity.

She was found dead in her living room with the television on, which suggested a sudden arrhythmic death. Nonetheless, pneumonia was assessed as the cause of the death, because of histological findings. The heart was both macroscopically and histologically normal, but only oral cavity and upper respiratory tract swabs for the influenza virus were performed for virology. The possible presence of the virus in the heart and its proarrhythmogenic role was not investigated. Yet, some studies have shown that cardiotropic viruses may cause acute \u2044 fulminant myocarditis without inflammatory cells (21) (22) (23) (24) . Influenza A \u2044 H1N1 (2009)-related myocarditis was assessed as the cause of two reported unexpected out-of-hospital deaths (2, 6) . In one case, there was no evidence of pneumonia, whereas in the other, the child patient had both pneumonia and myocarditis. Histological myocardial inflammation was present in both cases. In both cases, influenza A \u2044 H1N1 (2009) virus was found by PCR in the heart. However, in one case, no other cardiotropic viruses were sought in the heart to rule out the involvement of such viruses. In the other, cardiotropic viruses were sought in paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue. It has been shown that virological analyses should be performed on frozen tissue, because of false-negative results when paraffin-embedded tissues are used (15) . Furthermore, in both cases, influenza A\u2044 H1N1 (2009) virus load was not quantified.",

In the published cases, acute myocarditis was characterized by necrosis and inflammation, associated with the detection of influenza A \u2044 H1N1 (2009) by PCR (2, 6) . The possible presence of other cardiotropic viruses in the heart was not investigated. Furthermore, some studies have shown that cardiotropic viruses may cause acute \u2044 fulminant myocarditis without inflammatory cells (21) (22) (23) (24) . In our case, we did not find myocardial inflammation despite many samples in both ventricles (n = 15). According to Dallas criteria used for endomyocardial biopsy examination, myocarditis has been defined as inflammation associated with necrosis (25) . It is now recognized that the Dallas criteria are not sensitive for the diagnosis of myocarditis, because they do not take into account the presence of viral genome in the heart (19, 26) . Investigators have shown that virus may be present in the myocardium without Dallas myocarditis criteria. Martin et al. (21) demonstrated in 34 children with clinical presentations compatible with myocarditis that 26 heart biopsy samples were positive for viral pathogens, and 13 of the 26 positive samples had no evidence of myocarditis by histopathological examination. A metaanalysis of PCR studies in patients who had heart biopsies with presumed myocarditis or cardiomyopathy demonstrated an odds ratio of 3.8 for viral presence in both categories compared with control patients (22) . In a selected sample of 45 patients with left ventricular dysfunction and suspected myocarditis and 26 controls, nonreplicative enterovirus was demonstrated in 18 of 45 patients (40%) compared with none of the controls. Of the 18 patients with nonreplicative virus, 10 (56%) were found to have active viral replication as well (23) . Therefore, virus can exist in the myocardium in the absence of myocardial inflammation adequate to meet Dallas criteria and may adversely affect outcome (19) . In these cases, as in ours, death may have occurred before inflammation developed. The fulminant course in our case suggests high virus virulence and \u2044 or non-cell-mediated inflammation. As far as virus virulence is concerned, our genetic investigations did not reveal gene mutations involving hemaglutinin and neuraminidase. However, the patient had not received vaccination.",

Viral load quantification showed high levels of viral genome copies per microgram of extracted DNA in the different collected samples.

Furthermore, extraction of good-quality DNA and RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues is compromised because of incomplete removal of protein-nucleic acid cross-links (27) . Other authors performed real-time RT-PCR on nonrespiratory FFPE tissue and failed to detect influenza A \u2044 H1N1 (2009) (8) . Impaired nucleic acid can lead to false-negative result. It has been shown that quantification of viral load in different tissues provides information on the virus spreading pattern (28) . In one study, a high number of viral copies per cell in the trachea, compared with a small number in the lower lung samples, suggested a gradient of viral replication throughout the respiratory tract (12) . In our case, a higher viral load in the upper respiratory airways than in the lung was also found. Myocarditis has been recognized as one of the main causes of sudden death in the young (29) (30) (31) . It has long been underestimated because of the lack of autopsies. Forensic pathologists have played an important role in improving the knowledge of the different patterns. In most cases, the heart is grossly normal. Histology requires many samples in both ventricles because of the patchy inflammatory pattern (19, (29) (30) (31) . More recently, molecular biology has shown the importance of virological analyses performed on frozen tissue, including quantification of viral load (15, 19, 20, 26) . In our case, determination of viral loads in the absence of any inflammatory infiltrate in the myocardium has shown that influenza A \u2044 H1N1 (2009) virus can be a cause of out-of-hospital unexpected death in the young. Because symptoms are sometimes unspecific and mild, influenza A \u2044 H1N1 (2009)-related deaths may be misdiagnosed, which can raise medico-legal issues. As far as epidemiological and virological issues are concerned, autopsies and thorough virological investigations are useful in understanding pandemics and the virus virulence. ",
