It results primarily from embolus or thrombosis for ischemic stroke and hypertension for hemorrhagic stroke, respectively [1] . In 2016, there were 5.5 million deaths and 116.4 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) owed to stroke [2] . As reported, the impact of stroke on the Chinese population is more severe compared to average global levels, and the prevalence of stroke continues to surpass that of ischemic heart disease [3] [4] . Intravenous alteplase (rtPA) is an effective treatment for ischemic stroke, and conservative treatment or surgical treatment may be needed for hemorrhagic stroke [5] [6] . Though treatments have been developed to decline stroke mortality rates, the global burden of stroke remains substantial and it is increasing as populations continue to age.",

In this study, the use of hormones and immunosuppressants were also observed as possible risk factors, but they did not show statistical significance, probably because of the limited number of cases (n=10) in which the drugs were used in the study subjects.

Besides, the drug resistance rate varies in different regions, a higher rates of drug resistance was observed in developing countries [45] [46] . In this study, Acinetobacter baumannii showed a high resistance rate to most antibacterial drugs, up to 85.7%; and the drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to SXT reaches 57. 1% . Fortunately, neither of the two is resistant to tegacyclin or myxomycin at present. But, the high bacterial resistance rate still poses a serious threat to clinical antibacterial treatment in this hospital. Some scholars have suggested that strict antibacterial drug management may be beneficial for inhibiting bacterial resistance [47] [48] , while the development of new antibacterial drugs is also imminent at the same time.
