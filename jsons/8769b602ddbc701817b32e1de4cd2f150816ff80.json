Therefore, it was more difficult to identify a single causative agent of diarrhea in calves than it was in adult cows.

The finding that BCV was the major cause of epizootic adult cow diarrhea, often referred to as winter dysentery, supports findings reported previously (21) . Bovine RVA is considered a major causative pathogen of diarrhea in neonatal calves; it can also infect adult cows, but this is unusual (11, 16) . Some adult cows in this study were infected with bovine RVA. Our previous studies have shown that bovine RVB and RVC, rather than BCV, are associated with epidemic diarrhea in adult cows in Japan (14, 15) . The data presented here confirm that bovine RVB and RVC, followed by BCV, are frequently detected in adult cows with diarrhea, especially dairy cows. In addition, both bovine RVs and BCV were detected in adult dairy cows with diarrhea, mostly in winters. These data suggest that, especially during winter, adult dairy cows with diarrhea should be tested for both BCV and bovine RVs. Furthermore, by comparing with three separate outbreaks of diarrhea on the same dairy farm, we identified clear differences in clinical symptoms-such as duration of diarrhea epidemic, hematochezia and complications-between bovine RVs and BCV infections. Briefly, the diarrhea caused by bovine RV infection tends to be milder than that caused by BCV infection.

Possible explanations for the greater incidence of cases in adult dairy than in commercial beef cows include differences in contacts between farms, such as equipment sharing and movement of people and vehicles between farms, all of which may play a major role in transmission of infectious agents (22) . In contrast, there were more cases in beef calves than in dairy calves. There are several possible explanations for this difference. First, Japanese Black calves have a neonatal mortality rate of approximately 4.5% and in approximately half the neonates that die shortly after birth the cause is not apparent (1, 2) . This so-called stillbirth/perinatal weak calf syndrome (23) is characterized by low body weight, anemia, depression, weakness, variable body temperature, reddened and crusty muzzles and astasia; the syndrome is in part associated with genetic factors (1, 2) . These calves are highly susceptible to infection and die with symptoms of diarrhea or pneumonia within a few weeks of birth (2) . Second, clinical reports of Salmonella spp. infection occurred only in adult dairy cows and not in commercial beef cows. Adult dairy cows that are shedding this pathogen in their feces are typically asymptomatic (18) . However, dairy cows are fed high-protein concentrated food, including non-degradable protein that bypasses the rumen, to increase milk production. This could cause an imbalance in the physiological functions of the rumen, which might increase susceptibility to Salmonella spp. infection (24) . In addition, stress factors such as calving and milking may induce more severe diarrhea in dairy cows than in beef cows. Third, Eimeria spp. infections were identified only in commercial beef cows. Japanese beef cows are usually fed a diet that is low in vitamin A (25) (26) (27) . In particular, no vitamin A is added to their feed during the middle finishing period (16-18 months old) (28) . Many dietary factors, including vitamin A, are essential for gut and immune system development. In addition, low vitamin A intake is known to depress the responses of T-lymphocytes to mitogens in vitro (29, 30) . Moreover, deficiency of vitamin A is known to increase susceptibility of poultry to infection with enteric parasites such as coccidia (31, 32) . Thus, because of their low vitamin A intake, commercial beef cows may be more susceptible to coccidiosis than adult dairy cows.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 536, "end": 540, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 852, "end": 855, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 856, "end": 858, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1115, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1118, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1248, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1467, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1761, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2033, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2038, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2039, "end": 2043, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2151, "end": 2155, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2364, "text": "(29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2368, "text": "30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2509, "text": "(31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2513, "text": "32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Frequency of diarrhea in Japanese cattle"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our 10 year surveillance study revealed differences in the type and prevalence of enteric pathogens depending on the age and type of cattle.
