            "text": "Fast tracking after repair of congenital heart defects (CHD) is a process involving the reduction of perioperative period by timely admission, early extubation after surgery, short intensive care unit (ICU) stay, early mobilisation, and faster hospital discharge. It requires a coordinated multidisciplinary team involvement. The aim is to minimise resource utilisation without compromising patient safety and comfort. Early extubation is a major component, though not a synonym, of fast tracking. It has variably been defined as the time to extubation ranging from on-table extubation (OTE) up to 24 h after surgery. Early extubation after paediatric cardiac surgery was practiced out of necessity in the 1980s, when reliable ventilators for paediatric patients were not available. In 1980, Barash [1] published his experience with 197 patients less than 3 years of age, including neonates, with 61% of the patients extubated in the operating room (OR). Soon afterwards, similar studies [2] [3] [4] showed that extubation in the OR could be safely pursued after open-heart surgery and was associated with lower costs due to early discharge from ICU/hospital and lesser use of resources. In the following two decades, as a result of the rapid development of surgical techniques, increasingly younger and more complex patients were accepted for repair of congenital heart defects. With time, high-dose opioid anaesthetic technique became the standard of care, as it assured better haemodynamic stability, but required prolonged mechanical ventilation after surgery. In the late 1990s, the safety and feasibility of fast tracking was shown in large adult case series. Furthermore, the added benefits of reduced costs and better patient/family satisfaction were confirmed. The feasibility of fast tracking was attributed to newer anaesthetic agents like modern inhalational agents, short-acting opioids, and muscle relaxants. The practice of high-dose opioids and post-operative mechanical ventilation extended to paediatric cardiac surgery management. In the last 2 decades, many authors have adopted the fast tracking strategy in paediatric cardiac population, safely and successfully extubating patients in the OR with reported benefits in terms of reduced morbidity and ICU/hospital stay [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In this manuscript, we will review the literature available on early extubation after repair of CHD and share our experience with this approach.",

This hesitance towards fast tracking has persisted despite several studies having shown that neonates undergoing complex repairs can be safely extubated in the OR, but the incidence of extubation is less as compared with that in older population. The decision to practice fast tracking in high-risk patients is taken on individual basis by the multidisciplinary team according to the comfort and experience of the team, keeping patient safety as the top priority.",

            "text": "We started our on-table extubation experience in Narayana Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Bangalore, where 10-12 paediatric cardiac surgeries were performed everyday. At any one moment in time, up to 40 patients used be on mechanical ventilation in a 60-bed ICU with a variable number of patients frequently experiencing complications of prolonged ventilation, posing several challenges in terms of patient outcomes, manpower requirement, and resource consumption. A major change in practice was required which could safely reduce complications and provide better use of resources. After reviewing the literature on OTE, showing encouraging results in terms of feasibility and safety of OTE in children after cardiac surgery, we decided to adopt this practice on a routine basis. To bring about such a change, consensus was achieved among members of all the involved specialities. In a multidisciplinary team meeting, anaesthetic plan, surgical goals, perfusion strategy, modalities of intraoperative assessment, postoperative monitoring, and sedation protocols were finalised. The detailed anaesthetic plan was already published [13] . It followed the standard-of-care procedures with the aim to limit the use of systemic opioids (fentanyl up to 5 \u03bcg/kg) supplemented with the addition of caudal analgesia [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] as a single-shot procedure, using a mixture of morphine in a dose of 100 \u03bcg/kg and dexmedetomidine 1 \u03bcg/kg diluted to a volume of 1 ml/kg, to provide both intra-and post-operative analgesia. Induction and maintenance were achieved with oxygen, inhalational agent, even during CPB, and standard doses of muscle relaxants. Trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted in every patient to assess surgical repair and cardiac function. Every effort was undertaken to minimise the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and excessive increase in body water during CPB by miniaturisation of the circuit, pre-bypass filtration, and conventional (CUF) and modified ultrafiltration (MUF), maintaining a targeted haematocrit of 27% and 30% in infants and neonates, respectively [21] [22] [23] . Meticulous monitoring of systemic venous drainage, especially of the inferior vena cava, was done by a perfusionist to prevent critical reduction of pump flow and unwanted volume additions. Surgically, the goal was to ensure good surgical repair (i.e. without residual correctable lesions) and accurate haemostasis. At the end of surgery, TEE assessment was carried out to assess surgical repair. The identified residual correctable lesions were addressed in the same surgical session with no hesitation to undertake additional periods of CPB and aortic crossclamping.",

In fact, older children used to deny having pain and explicitly asked for food while infants used to pacify after feeding After initial experience, we continued the same practice and extended the same approach in different hospital settings (job relocation and involvement in several charity missions) with more inspiration from different studies [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . In the past 3 years, with the addition of new members, we have been able to replicate our OTE strategy with consistent results in 6 different hospitals. We are now able to extubate approximately 90% of the patients on-table with re-intubation rate as low as 1.4%. With this practice and increasing confidence of each team component, we have been able to achieve OTE in several patients in whom this approach would normally be considered contraindicated according to the standard management criteria, for example high Aristotle score (including our only 2 Norwood patients) [29] , low weight, long CPB and aortic cross-clamp times, and mechanical ventilation dependence prior to surgery. For example, we were able to extubate 84% of the patients with long CPB (more than 180 min) ( Table 2 ).",

The effects of CPB can be minimised by technological advances like miniaturisation of the circuit and various modalities of ultrafiltration to name a few. With increasing experience and confidence of the team, we observed that even a very long duration of CPB, with or without a period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, does not limit the suitability of the patient for OTE, as long as the homeostasis is maintained.",

Post-operative pain and, particularly, endotracheal tube suctioning are the main causes for postoperative pulmonary hypertensive crises in predisposed patients. Vida et al. concluded that pulmonary hypertension does not seem to be a contraindication for early extubation [9] . We also observed similar results and believe that a successful OTE strategy should include a multimodal approach to adequate pain control, and in the absence of an endotracheal tube, frequent suctioning of the trachea and bronchial tree is not required. Mild hypercapnia observed in the immediate postoperative period in our patients was well tolerated despite a theoretical risk to aggravate pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. We observed that none of the patients showed any sign of worsening right ventricular function (as assessed by serial transthoracic echocardiography), desaturation, bradycardia, or reintubation. Similar observation was made by Kloth et al. [7] .",

Successful fast tracking reflects a team-based approach, and it is a very reassuring experience to see a child already awake and spontaneously breathing in the immediate post-operative period, even after a complex cardiac operation. OTE patients may need much more attention in the first 1-2 h but post-operative complications are avoided, as well as ICU/ hospital stay is reduced. This leads to more efficient utilisation of resources [13] and possibly reduction of costs. This practice can be implemented if all the team members of perioperative care collectively plan, assess, and manage the patients [35] .",
