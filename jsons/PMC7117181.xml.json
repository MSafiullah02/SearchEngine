            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in seronegative nursing piglets. PEDV is enveloped and pleomorphic with a range in diameter of 95\u2013190 nm, including the spikes (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). PEDV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb (excluding the poly A-tail) that encodes 4 structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein) and 4 nonstructural proteins (1a, 1b, 3a, and 3b) (Kocherhans et al., 2001). PEDV has resulted in significant economic losses, initially only in the European and Asian swine industries over the last 3 decades. Recently, however, PEDV was first reported in the United States in May 2013 in Iowa and has spread nationally (Stevenson et al., 2013). PEDV outbreaks in the US have led to significant economic impacts as a result of the high mortality among seronegative nursing piglets and decreased pork production (Cima, 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013). The US PEDV (PC21A strain) was highly enteropathogenic in experimentally infected, 10\u201335-day-old gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs, as evident by severe clinical disease and lesions (Jung et al., 2014).",

In specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs from 2 days to 12 weeks of age, experimentally inoculated with a wild-type Japanese PEDV strain, deaths occurred mainly in 2- to 7-day-old pigs and virus replication was higher in newborn pigs (Shibata et al., 2000). Conventional 3-week-old weaned pigs experimentally inoculated with a US PEDV strain exhibited relatively milder clinical disease (Madson et al., 2014). However, the mechanisms by which PEDV infection induces greater disease severity and deaths of nursing piglets vs. weaned pigs, have not been clearly defined (Jung and Saif, 2015).",

The proliferative level of intestinal crypt cells determines the turnover time of enterocytes in pigs. The turnover rate of the intestinal epithelium may also depend on stem cells in the intestinal crypts. Intestinal stem cells consist mainly of three cell types: leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5-positive crypt base columnar cells (LGR5-positive crypt cells), +4 cells, and Paneth cells (Sato and Clevers, 2013); however, the presence of Paneth cells in the intestine of swine is debatable (Burkey et al., 2009). Intestinal crypt stem cells may be critical for the epithelial cell renewal during PEDV infection.",

In contrast, during the acute stage of infection, conventional seronegative, 26-day-old weaned pigs appeared resistant to PC21A strain, as manifested by little clinical disease, fecal virus shedding, and gross and histologic intestinal lesions at PID 1. Thereafter, however, it was notable that the inoculated weaned pigs exhibited high fecal viral shedding titers at PIDs 2\u20135 and mild to severe atrophic enteritis at PIDs 3\u20135. A longer incubation period of PEDV was required for the weaned pigs to show fecal virus shedding (by 1 more day) or lesions (by 2 more days).",

Decreased fecal shedding PEDV titers at PIDs 3 and 5 might coincide with extensively reduced sites of viral replication following the substantially decreased numbers of enterocytes lining the epithelium of severely atrophied villi at these time-points (Fig. 5A). Regardless of the infection stage, all inoculated nursing piglets at PIDs 1\u20135 commonly exhibited high fecal consistency scores (all scores, 3). Based on these observations, PEDV-infected nursing piglets are mostly clinical and shed large amounts of viruses (viral RNA) in the diarrheic feces during the early to later stages of infection.

This observation confirms that sub-clinical PEDV-infected weaned pigs are able to shed a large amount of viruses (viral RNA) to infect other na\u00efve pigs (Madson et al., 2014). It was notable that at PIDs 3\u20135, the inoculated weaned pigs (11/12 pigs tested) also showed low viral RNA titers in the sera. None of the PEDV-inoculated weaned pigs tested at PID 1 showed clinical disease (0/8 pigs tested), gross and histologic intestinal lesions (0/8 pigs tested), and PEDV antigen-positive cells in the intestine (0/8 pigs tested). The low frequency of fecal virus shedding (1/8 pigs tested) coincided with the similar low rate of detection of viral RNA in the serum samples of the corresponding pigs (1/8 pigs tested) and low fecal shedding RNA titer (mean, 4.9 log10 GE/ml) at this time-point and the finding that weaned pigs did not show evidence of PEDV infection at PID 1 (delayed onset). This indicates that weaned pigs failed to show evidence of US PEDV strain PC21A infection at PID 1. Significantly greater innate immune responses in ileum and blood at PID 1 may have contributed to the early resistance of weaned pigs to PEDV infection, compared to nursing piglets (Annamalai, T., Jung, K., Saif, L.J., unpublished). As observed in PEDV-inoculated nursing piglets at PID 1, high fecal shedding PEDV RNA titers were mostly accompanied by moderate viral RNA titers in serum. Overall, rather than the severity of clinical disease, the level of viremia in PEDV-infected pigs may relate to the severity of atrophic enteritis and structural alteration of tight and adherens junctions in the jejunal and ileal villous epithelium in a manner dependent on the extent of PEDV replication (reflected by fecal viral RNA shedding titer) in the intestine (Jung et al., 2015a, Jung et al., 2015b).

Although the related mechanisms were unclear, gross and histologic lesions were limited to the small intestine of PEDV-inoculated nursing and weaned pigs, but not the large intestine. At PIDs 1\u20135, however, the large intestine of inoculated nursing piglets was mostly accumulated with large amounts of yellowish fluid, which coincided with the high frequency of severe watery diarrhea for the period. Large amounts of diarrheic fluid filled the small intestine of PEDV-inoculated weaned pigs at PID 5, but stools in the large intestinal lumen appeared solid. By pathological examinations, the structurally normal large intestine of PEDV-infected weaned pigs may contribute to reabsorption of the large amount of water accumulated or released from the small intestinal lumen, thereby maintaining hydration and leading to a rapid recovery from disease in weaned pigs. The normal large intestine of PEDV-inoculated weaned pigs also coincided with the frequent lack of diarrhea (9/12 pigs tested) at PIDs 3 and 5.",

Intestinal stem cells located in the villous crypts replace the apoptotic (normal process) or necrotic (virus-induced) enterocytes shed at the villous tips and are essential for maintenance of the intestinal epithelium (Saif et al., 2012). The turnover rate of the intestinal epithelium may depend on the stem cells and their proliferative levels in the intestinal crypt. The turnover of enterocytes was slower in neonatal nursing piglets vs. weaned pigs (Moon et al., 1973). Our study suggests that a lack of LGR5-positive crypt stem cells and lower numbers of proliferating crypt cells in the small intestine of uninoculated nursing piglets might lead to the slower turnover of enterocytes in nursing piglets vs. weaned pigs, possibly also influencing the slower recovery from disease in nursing piglets. After PEDV inoculation, however, the number of LGR5-positive crypt stem cells and proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in nursing piglets increased remarkably at PIDs 3 and 5, likely leading to replacement of necrotic enterocytes shed from infected villi. On the other hand, the uninoculated weaned pigs tested at PIDs 1\u20135 exhibited high numbers of proliferating intestinal crypt cells and LGR5-positive crypt stem cells, likely contributing to the rapid turnover rate of enterocytes. The high proliferation rates and LGR5-positive scores in the intestinal crypts were maintained after PEDV inoculation, ultimately influencing the rapid recovery from disease in weaned pigs.",

Partially based on our data, in infected nursing piglets, there are increased proliferation of crypt cells and numbers of LGR5+ crypt stem cells in the intestine, reorganization of the damaged intestinal epithelium, and migration of mature enterocytes to the tips of villi which may be not sufficient to prevent severe dehydration in nursing piglets. This process is essential for efficient digestion and adsorption of milk or water. The rapid dehydration of PEDV-infected nursing piglets in the field limits recovery from the disease through the naturally occurring epithelial cell renewal by crypt stem cells. Pharmacologic or biologic mediators such as epidermal growth factor that promote stem cell regeneration or maturation would be interesting targets to use to try to shorten the time for epithelial cell renewal and reduce PEDV death losses among nursing pigs from dehydration.",

LGR5-positive scores were computed by estimating the number of IF-positive cells in the intestinal section per microscopic area, at \u00d7200 magnification based on the following criteria: 0, no positive cells; 1, 1\u201329% of LGR5-positive crypt epithelial cells showed staining; 2, 30\u201359% of LGR5-positive crypt epithelial cells showed staining; and 3, 60\u2013100% of LGR5-positive crypt epithelial cells showed staining. Each bar represents the mean \u00b1 SDM. Different letters denote significant differences among groups at each time-point (ANOVA test, P < 0.05).",
