            "text": "Remdesivir (GS-5734), a prodrug, is metabolized within cells into an alanine metabolite\n(GS-704277), further processed into the monophosphate derivative and ultimately into the\nactive nucleoside triphosphate derivative (Figure 3). Nucleotide analogues are not highly cell permeable, and once in the cell they\nrequire di- and then triphosphorylation to produce the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) that\ncan be utilized by the viral RNA-dependent polymerases for genome replication. As such, NTPs\ncan then be misintegrated into viral RNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP;\nFigure 2). To address this, an approach to\nantiviral drug design can employ the utilization of phosphoramidate prodrugs (ProTides,\ninferred as prodrugs of\nnucleotides).62\u221265 Protides are composed of a nucleoside\nmonophosphate capped with an aryl group and an amino acid ester (a phosphoramidate).\nFollowing diffusion into the cell, the prodrug is presumed to metabolize in a sequence of\nhydrolytic steps that starts with esterase-mediated ester hydrolysis to a carboxylate that\ncyclizes internally to the phosphonate ejecting the phenoxide; the resultant unstable cyclic\nanhydride is hydrolyzed open by water to the alanine metabolite GS-704277 whose P\u2013N\nbond is hydrolyzed by a phosphoramidase-type enzyme (Figure 3).66\u221269 This final step liberates the nucleoside monophosphate,\nwhich is highly polar, and does not diffuse back across the cell membrane (essentially\ntrapping it within the cell). Subsequent phosphorylation by host cell kinases convert the\ncompound into the NTP analogue that can be used as a substrate by the viral RdRp\nenzyme.70 While the nucleoside analogue core of remdesivir, GS-441524,\ncan diffuse into cells, the initial phosphorylation step for nucleosides is rate-limiting\n(slow), which is believed to account for the reduced antiviral activity of GS-441524\ncompared to remdesivir.49,71 This approach has been successfully applied to a number of FDA-approved\nantiviral drugs including the Gilead products sofosbuvir (for treating HCV) and tenofovir\nalafenamide (first approved for treating HIV).64",
