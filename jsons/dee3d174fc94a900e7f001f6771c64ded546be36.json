WHO defined it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)on 31 January 2020.The pathogen was soon isolated from apatient's alveolar lavage and identified as a novel coronavirus. [16] The human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, and the SARS-CoV-2 all belong to beta-CoVs. Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and the SARS-CoV-2 share 96.2% sequence identity, confirming that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin. [17, 18] R 0 is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally na\u00efve population. R 0 estimates for SARS were reported to range between 2-5. Different mathematical methods used to estimate R 0 for SARS-COV-2 produced a range from 1.5 to 6.49 based on different epidemic stages. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] The most prominent area of Hubei Province is Wuhan with 49,122 cases, which suggested that mass outbreak of COVID-19 and community spread in Wuhan. A previous report indicated that among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city, [24] which suggested that it was mostly associated to Feb 2020 because test reagents for RT-PCR assay began to be widely used in Hubei Province along with lung CT as the diagnostic criteria. This did not represent a large number of patients in a mass outbreak on 14 Feb 2020, and the decrease in the rate of confirmed patients before the 14 Feb 2020 was an illusion due to a lack of enough test reagents. Also, suspected cases began to significantly decrease from 14 Feb 2020 because suspected cases were confirmed or ruled out by test reagents widely used and the new diagnostic criteria of lung CT.",

The mortality of the COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei Province than other regions nationwide(4.1% versus 0.84%). This may be because of the following factors: 1) the virulence and pathogenicity of the virus decreased in the 2nd and 3rd generation of transmission [26] , 2)a significant number of mild and asymptomatic patients did not seek medical attention, 3)early patients cannot be confirmed due to lacking the nucleic acid test, and 4)some severe patients with co-morbidity lost the opportunity for timely treatment due to insufficient medical resources in the early days of the epidemic. So, the high mortality in Hubei Province may be overestimated and mortality of other regions should better reflect the pathogenicity of the COVID-19.",

Since the number of confirmed cases in other regions is small and most of the confirmed patients have a clear history of sojourn in Hubei Province and contact with imported cases from Hubei Province, we speculate that there has been no large-scale community transmission in other regions outside of Hubei Province, which is due to strict prevention and control measures implemented sooner in other regions. The maximum incubation period and median incubation period are 14 and 4 days, respectively.[24] The timing of one maximum incubation period and double maximum incubation periods is considered an important time point for predicting the prevailing trend.[25] After a 28-day interval, in which Wuhan was closed from January 23 to February 20, the growth rate of confirmed cases in other regions outside of Hubei Province declined to 0.04% and has remained stable over the past few days. With a double maximum incubation period, the growth rate of confirmed cases declined to a low level, which suggested that the infection was mainly imported cases and did not cause further community transmission outside of Hubei Province and the spread of the epidemic under initial control with Wuhan quarantined. The number of confirmed cases significantly increased on 14",

With test reagents widely used and the large number of mobile cabin hospitals with effective isolation of patients, the number of confirmed patients, the growth rate of confirmed patients, and the growth rate of suspected patients have all declined. So, timely and effective detection of patients and isolation is the most important strategy for Hubei Province. In other regions, it was mostly imported cases and there was no community spread. With strict control measures and the extension of time, the number of confirmed cases and the growth rate of confirmed cases have remained at a low level in other regions, and even the number of confirmed cases showed a zero increase in many regions. So, strictly controlling imported cases is the most important strategy for other regions outside of Hubei Province. In summary, this epidemic of the COVID-19 will remain for some time due to large numbers of confirmed cases, suspected cases, and quarantined observers. However, the growth rate of confirmed and suspected cases continues to decline and the number of discharged patients continues to grow both in Hubei Province and other regions nationwide, which indicate that the outbreak is under initial control especially in regions outside of Hubei Province in China. We optimistically estimate that the outbreak was largely control in regions outside of Hubei Province within the double maximum incubation periods(28 days)with the strengthening of control of imported cases, while the epidemic will continue in Hubei Province especially in Wuhan for a large number of patients. Timely detection and isolation of patients is the most important measure to reduce the prevalence in Hubei Province.",
