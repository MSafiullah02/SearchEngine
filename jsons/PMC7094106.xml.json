            "text": "The success of human genome project has pushed newly discovered biological sequences to grow in an explosive rate (Chou, 2009). Facing the explosive growth of DNA and protein sequences, experimental, mathematical and graphical approaches have been employed to study the structure, function, evolution and attribution (Chou, 2011) of these sequences. As a powerful tool, the graphical methods can help people gain useful insights in an intuitive or visual manner. Many graphic approaches have been successfully used to study complicated biological topics, such as enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Chou, 1980, Chou, 1989, Chou, 1990, Chou and Forsen, 1980, Chou and Forsen, 1981, Chou and Liu, 1981, Andraos, 2008), protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990, Chou and Shen, 2009, Shen et al., 2009), drug metabolism kinetics (Chou, 2010), analysis of codon usage (Zhang and Chou, 1993, Zhang and Chou, 1994), analysis of base frequencies in the anti-sense strands (Chou et al., 1996), prediction of protein subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006a, Xiao et al., 2006b), HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005), hepatitis B viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a, Xiao et al., 2006b), G-protein coupled receptors (Lin et al., 2009, Xiao et al., 2009a, Xiao et al., 2011) and prediction of protein structure (Xiao et al., 2008a, Xiao et al., 2008b, Xiao et al., 2009b, Xiao and Lin, 2009c, Xiao et al., 2010). Recently, several graphical method applications were also used to examine the similarities/dissimilarities among the coding sequences of different species (Randic\u00b4 et al., 2003a, Randic\u00b4 et al., 2003b, Randic\u00b4, 2006, Yao et al., 2006, Yao et al., 2008, Yao et al., 2010, Qi et al., 2007, Qi and Qi, 2007, Qi and Qi, 2009, Qi and Fan, 2007), study cellular signaling networks (Diao et al., 2007), analyze the network structure of the amino acid metabolism (Shikata et al., 2007), provide web-server for protein sequences (Wu et al., 2010), study the fingerprint of SARS coronavirus (Wang et al., 2005, Gao et al., 2006) and discover codon position patterns of eubacteria (Qi and Wei, 2011).",

Similarity is a concept from signal similarity theory. It describes the similarity degree when one signal is compared with another signal. Here, the concept about similarity degree of signals is used to describe the similarity degree between two genes. Then we obtain the similarity information between any pair of genes in a genome when every gene of the genome is compared with other genes in the same genome. The overall statistical results about similarity degree are called as self-similarity characteristic of genome. The self-similarity analysis of genome can discover some interesting biological information hidden in genome. Generally, gene evolution includes three main approaches: gene point mutation, gene recombination and horizontal gene transfer (Syvanen and Kado, 2002). The same result from different evolution approaches is that every gene of genome perhaps has its similar genes within the same genome. If one gene has many similar genes within genome, it is relatively active in its evolution pathway. Otherwise, this gene is comparatively conservative. Then, how many active genes does a genome have? What differences do there exist among different genomes? Here, we introduce weighted graph method to investigate these problems about the 23 eubacteria genome studied in Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004) and Qi et al. (2009). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the self-similarity analysis model of genome based on weighted graph and some statistical information of this model. Section 3 mainly discusses some quantified statistical variables about the self-similarity characteristic of different genomes and several distributions about the statistical variables. Section 4 gives the conclusion of this paper.",

Recently, two seminal models about graph theory, \u201csmall-world\u201d network (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and \u201cBA\u201d network (Barab\u00e1si and Albert, 1999) were proposed. The models brought about the naissance of complex networks theory as a new branch about graph theory. In the past ten years, the new branch received an increasing attention. Here, we introduce weighted graph theory to investigate the self-similarity characteristics of the 23 eubacteria genomes. In a weighted graph, a specific value is associated with each connection and the value describes the strength of the connection. An adjacency matrix corresponding to a weighted graph is a weight matrix. The weight is used to describe the strength of each different links.

The detailed view for each segment of alignment includes the statistics with the percentage of identities, positives and gaps, schematic view, and the text alignment view. We can obtain the detailed statistics information for two closely related sequences by BLAST (bl2seq) with a given expectation value (E-value). As for two distantly related sequences, we cannot possibly get any statistics information. There are no similar areas between the two sequences. In order to simplify the graph structure, we remove the links with zero value from the weighted graph. Similarly, the node is also removed from the graph if a node has no any links connected to other nodes. Then in the graph, every link is associated with a real value derived from the detailed statistics information by BLAST (bl2seq) with a given E-value. The graph becomes a weighted graph related to a genome.

According to BLAST tutorial, if the E-value is less than 1\u00d710\u221250, the hit is very similar to the query sequence and is very likely to be evolutionarily related. If the E-value is between 1\u00d710\u221250 and 1\u00d710\u22122, the hit has some similarity to the query sequence and may be related. The E-values in the range can indicate that the sample sequence is in the same family as the hit or it may have closely related functional domains.

There are only three species with a percentage less than 60%. These data indicate that most of genes in genome are relatively active in their evolution pathways. As for a genome, it is impossible for point mutation to reach so large social structures. The statistic data give a possible explanation that some genes continuously exchange some segments each other. Perhaps segment reassortment (or recombination) and association in genome, that is to say, are the main evolutionary approaches.(ii)In the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth column of the table, we calculate the statistic information about the largest one in all social structures. The statistic data shows that the genes in the largest social structure occupy the majority proportion of complete genome. The other social structures only occupy a small percentage in genome except for the largest social structure. The statistic data shows that most of genes in genome are associated with each other. The ninth column in the table illustrates the average number of links of every gene in the largest social structure. Obviously, the genes are more active when their links are high. The species with the largest number of connections is Clostridium perfringens 13 in which the average number of links reaches 6.96. The average links can discover the comprehensive trend about relation among different genes.

The classification into two groups by different approaches shows the evolutionary distance among different eubacteria. Here we draw a different conclusion. Our classification into two groups by the double logarithmic point-plot cannot show their evolution distances. However, we can discover the evolution patterns among the different eubacteria. The following are the details:(i)If ignoring the upward tails of some curves, all double logarithmic point-plots in Fig. 3 are similar to the power law distribution. This shows that the relations among genes of the largest social structure are neither random nor homogeneous. They show some features similar to \u201csmall world\u201d. From a biological view, this reflects on a possible evolution pattern. Most of genes are relatively conservative and merely have a little chance to interact with others in their evolution pathways. However, a few genes with very high degree perhaps exchanged gene pieces with quite a number of other ones.(ii)Some double logarithmic point-plots of Fig. 3, such as Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, have upward tails at the end of the curve. This shows that there is a high increase in the number of genes with very high degree. This increase is so high that the corresponding dot-set of the double logarithmic point-plot departs from the power law distribution. These genes are quite active and perhaps exchanged gene pieces with quite a number of other ones in their evolution pathways.\n",

Yet the pattern as shown in Fig. 4 means that the similarities between the genes are low. There are two possible reasons to explain the special phenomenon about Bacillus subtilis.

In this model, a genome is attributed to a weighted graph to express the relationship among similar genes in the same genome. Then the weighted graphs are used to investigate the self-similarity characteristics of different genomes from 23 eubacteria. Unlike the studies of the 23 eubacteria in Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004) and Qi et al. (2009), here they are markedly classified into two different groups by their double logarithmic point-plots describing the similarity relations among genes of the largest social structure in genome. One group is the eubacteria similar to the power law distribution, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori J99. The other includes the eubacteria with an upward tail at the end of the double logarithmic point-plot, such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus Mu50. The results show that the proposed model may provide us with some new sights to understand the structures and evolution patterns determined from the complete genomes.",
