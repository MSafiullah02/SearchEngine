            "text": "Chagas disease occurs throughout Mexico and Central and South America and continues to pose a serious threat to health in many countries of these regions. People infected with the trypanosome parasite may suffer cardiac, gastrointestinal, or neurological damage, although disease manifestations vary widely from one endemic area to another [1]. In Chagas\u2019 disease, as in other parasitic diseases, no effective vaccine for humans is yet available in spite of the numerous experimental approaches performed with different antigenic materials, ranging from subcellular fractions to recombinant antigens or even plasmid DNA encoding antigens of Trypanosoma cruzi\n[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. In our laboratory, we have developed a model of mice vaccination with Trypanosoma rangeli, a non-pathogenic Trypanosomatidae also infecting people in Latin America [8], that shares many antigens with T. cruzi\n[9], [10]. The immunisation schedule elicited B and T specific responses to T. cruzi, as well as a particular pattern of cytokines and a strong reduction in the mortality rate among infected mice. Indeed, more than 95% of vaccinated mice survived a lethal T. cruzi infection and displayed significantly reduced parasitemia during the acute phase [11], associated with high levels of specific antibodies and elevated serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, low levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and normal levels of IL-10, together with the absence of histopathological lesions [12].",

In recent years, other authors have also reported a protective response induced by T. rangeli by using other strains and employing different experimental model [16], [17]. The protective effect is based on the high antigenic similarity between T. cruzi and T. rangeli\n[18]. Besides, as autoimmunity is one of the postulated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas\u2019 disease [19], [20], the immunisation with non-pathogenic parasites should not induce deleterious autoimmune response. Our protocol of immunisation with fixed epimastigotes of T. rangeli induced an antibody response against T. cruzi in dogs. This was associated with a shorter acute parasitemic phase of weaker amplitude. More interestingly, although dogs were not fully protected by this vaccination, their lower parasitemia led to a lower rate of infection of the vector T. infestans when they feed on the blood of chronically infected dogs. In a field trial, Basombrio et al. [21] reported similar results obtained by vaccination with attenuated T. cruzi.",
