Maternal stress in late gestation, onset of oxygen respiration, and dystocia can plague newborn calves by instigating oxidative stress and a prolonged state of inflammation (Saugstad, 2003; Hulbert and Mois\u00e1, 2016; Ling et al., 2018). In fact, this major stress period has been called the \u201cbirth critical window\u201d (Hulbert and Mois\u00e1, 2016). Our long-term goal is to improve health of calves in the first 2 wk of life without the use of antibiotics to enhance feed efficiency and growth.",

Previous studies indicate that n-3 FA supplementation to milk replacer improved growth, health, or indicators of immune function in calves (Ballou et al., 2008; Ballou and DePeters, 2008; Karcher et al., 2014). This is accomplished in part by production of anti-inflammatory n-3 FA metabolites coupled with antioxidant properties (Mavangira and Sordillo, 2018). Feeding diets that enhance growth rates during the preweaning period affects age of first service, conception, and first-lactation milk yield (Brown et al., 2005; Davis Rincker et al., 2011). All preweaned calf studies involving n-3 FA supplementation to date have relied on milk replacer or calf starter as the vehicle, but to our knowledge none supplemented these FA to colostrum in a one-time dose. Such a burst in supplemental n-3 FA could boost blood n-3 FA and mitigate oxidative stress experienced in the first 2 wk of life.",

However, if added n-3 FA hinder absorption of nutrients or immunoglobulins in colostrum, mortality and morbidity rates may increase.

Samples were then measured at 530-nm excitation and 480-nm emission where blank sample fluorescence was subtracted from sample value (Ling et al., 2018). Antioxidant potential of the same samples was quantified through the units of Trolox equivalents, a synthetic analog of \u03b1-tocopherol, where values of antioxidant potential were compared using a photometric plate reader. 2,2'-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid was used as a radical cation to be reduced by antioxidants. The reduction potential of each sample, compared as Trolox equivalents, was compared using a photometric plate reader. This decolorization assay is further described in Re et al. (1999). Both assays used to assess oxidant status are detailed further by Putman et al. (2018).",

One possible mechanism is through increased n-3 FA, which compete for the same enzymatic reactions n-6 FA use to produce a large variety of known proinflammatory metabolites (Sordillo, 2018). Cytochrome enzymes, for example, use both n-3 and n-6 FA as substrates but, with increasing concentrations of n-3 FA, will sometimes favor EPA over ARA as a substrate (Arnold et al., 2010). Notably, EPA and DHA produce oxylipids with anti-inflammatory properties and oxylipids with lower proinflammatory potential than the competing ARA substrate; subsequently, greater metabolism of EPA will result in decreased RONS production. Thus, a prolonged response in decreased oxidant status such as that observed may have been assisted by n-3 FA catabolism. Some metabolites such as resolvins and protectins act as anti-inflammatory signaling molecules and are not only effective at decreasing inflammation but also protect against hyperinflammatory conditions (Calder, 2010). A definitive association of downregulated inflammation with decreased RONS production has been observed after supplementation with n-3 FA (Takahashi et al., 2002). A future study should examine what products of n-3 FA metabolism may affect the oxidant balance after a one-time dose in colostrum as reported in the current study.",

In our study, we observed decreased \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations in FFE calves during wk 1. Supplementation of PUFA is known to decrease \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations in blood (Raederstorff et al., 2015), and we speculate that the depressed \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations observed in FFE calves were due to depletion by n-3 FA to prevent peroxidation. Incorporating 200 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol in the FFE treatment, which is greater than the minimum recommendation of 0.6 mg of \u03b1-tocopherol/g of PUFA (Harris and Embree, 1963), was not enough to sustain plasma \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations of FFE calves at the same concentrations as in CON calves; nevertheless, FFE calves did not show visible signs of \u03b1-tocopherol deficiency, and plasma concentrations remained within recommended levels (Reddy et al., 1987).",

Failure of passive transfer (<52 g of protein/L of serum) puts the calf at risk for poor vitality and immune function. To our knowledge, no one has published effects of a lipid supplement to colostrum. We found that FFE did not alter normal absorption of IgG. Serum protein concentrations remained similar across CON (65 g/L) and FFE (64 g/L), where P = 0.35. Kamada et al. (2007) observed increased IgG concentrations in calves fed selenium-supplemented colostrum. Based on this finding, one might expect that the presence of \u03b1-tocopherol in our supplement might also increase IgG concentrations, but we did not observe this.",
