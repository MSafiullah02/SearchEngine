            "text": "Viral upper respiratory tract infections are potentially highly relevant to CRS. The average healthy adult person experiences 1 to 3 common colds per year (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/commoncold/pages/overview.aspx). In healthy subjects the onset and time course of cold symptoms and levels of viral mRNA detectable in nasal secretions over 21 days have been mapped out after experimental rhinovirus infection.4, 5 Patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease manifest a significantly higher peak rhinovirus 16 viral load and duration of symptoms. Asthmatic patients also manifest a corresponding 10-fold decreased induction of type I (\u03b2) and type III (\u03bb1 and \u03bb2/3) interferons.6 Given the similarities between asthma and CRS at the tissue level and the fact that many CRS exacerbations occur during the viral season,7 it is plausible that a similar defect exists in patients with CRS. However, experimental rhinovirus infection has not been studied in patients with CRS. The innate antiviral response to rhinovirus infection involves activation of type I interferons through interferon-regulatory factor 1 gene activation, an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production, and epithelial production of human \u03b2-defensin (hBD) 2, IL-8, and RANTES.8, 9 IL-17A was found to augment production of hBD-2 and IL-8 but downregulate production of RANTES in this model. The chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-inducible protein 10) is also induced.10\n",

This study examined nasal lavage fluid and turbinate epithelial cells (collected with a Rhino-probe mucosal curette; Rhino-Probe, Arlington Scientific, Arlington, Tex) from 39 patients with CRS and 27 healthy control subjects (HCs). Using an RT-PCR\u2013based assay, they found that lavage fluid from all patients with CRS and HCs and turbinate epithelial cells from HCs were negative for picornavirus, whereas 8 (21%) of 39 epithelial cell samples from patients with CRS were positive. Further examination revealed that all 8 patients with CRS with positive results had positive results for rhinovirus.

In support of a role for anaerobic bacteria in chronic maxillary sinusitis, Finegold et al22 found recurrence of signs and symptoms to be twice as frequent when cultures yielding anaerobic bacterial counts of greater than 103 cfu/mL. Further supportive evidence came from the detection of IgG antibodies to anaerobic organisms commonly recovered from sinus aspirates, namely Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia. Antibody levels to these organisms decreased in the patients who responded to therapy but did not decrease in those in whom therapy failed.23 Recent studies with molecular techniques have shed new light on the potential role of anaerobes in patients with CRS (see below).",

One study34 found biofilm to be present in only 2 of 12 patients with NPs, a lower prevalence than reported in most other studies of CRS. When the studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) are taken in total (excluding the study confined to patients with NPs), the prevalence of biofilm in the CRS case series summarized in Table E1 was 56.3%.",

In contrast, polymicrobial biofilm or biofilm containing S aureus was associated with more severe disease and a poorer postoperative course.36 The presence of bacterial biofilm was strongly associated with persistent mucosal inflammation after endoscopic sinus surgery (53% of biofilm-positive patients vs 0% of biofilm-negative patients).31 One study showed that the likelihood of detecting bacteria with biofilm-forming capacity increases in relation to prior endoscopic sinus surgery, possibly reflecting the severity of their disease.37 Similarly, Zhang et al38 found an association of biofilm forming-capacity in vitro from clinical samples with prior sinus surgeries and nasal steroid use in the month before sample collection but no association with the presence of NPs, allergy, or Samter triad and an association with positive culture results at least suggesting that biofilm might be of greater relevance in patients with nonpolypoid CRS. In summary, these studies suggest that that mucosal biofilm is a marker of more severe mucosal disease and a predictor of poorer outcome after sinus surgery. On the basis of animal models of rhinosinusitis, biofilm formation might reflect the severity, chronicity, or both of sinus infection.39\n",

PCD is a rare, usually autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sinopulmonary disease, laterality defects (eg, situs inversus), and male infertility. PCD has traditionally been diagnosed based on ultrastructural defects in cilia, which are identified in about 90% of patients with PCD and involve the outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, or both.59 Mutational analyses have discovered that 38% of patients with PCD carry mutations of the dynein genes DNAI1 and DNAH5.59 Because it is estimated that normal ciliary function involves more than 1000 gene products, additional mutations accounting for the remaining 62% of patients with PCD are likely to be uncovered. Recently, screening of 146 unrelated PCD families identified patients in 6 families with reduced outer dynein arms carrying mutations in CCDC103.60 The CCDC103 gene product might function as a tightly bound, axoneme-associated protein. A somewhat similar clinical syndrome known as Young syndrome is characterized by obstructive azoospermia with normal sperm structure and function and recurrent sinopulmonary infections.61 Unlike patients with PCD, no mutations in ciliary structural genes have been identified in patients with Young syndrome, and the problem has been presumed to be caused by an abnormality in mucus.62\n",

Cp110 is known to prevent the terminal step in ciliary maturation. They further showed that Cp110 could be induced in vitro by proinflammatory cytokines in cultured sinus epithelial cells with concomitant inhibition of ciliogenesis. In contrast, there is no evidence for a primary defect in mucociliary clearance to account for CRS. To date, genetic association studies of patients with refractory CRS have not uncovered any gene polymorphisms that would suggest a primary defect in mucociliary clearance.70\n",

DMBT1 interacts with and agglutinates several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, a bacterium responsible for dental caries. DMBT1 interacts with surfactant protein A (SP-A) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) and a variety of other host proteins involved in innate immunity or wound healing. A precise role for DMBT1 in human disease has yet to be elucidated. DMBT-1 is overexpressed in NPs mainly in submucosal glands.110\n",

In these studies SP-A and SP-D immunoreactivity was found in epithelial cells and submucosal seromucinous glands. One other study reported reduced immunostaining for SP-D in nasal submucosal glands and a lack of induction of SP-D by Aspergillus and Alternaria species allergens in cultured nasal explants from patients with nonallergic fungal eosinophilic sinusitis.114 In contrast, these allergens induced SP-D production in HCs and patients with CRS. Ramanathan et al3 showed that culturing human sinonasal epithelial cells in the presence of the TH2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 for 36 hours reduced expression of antimicrobial innate immune genes by using real-time PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry, including TLR9, hBD-2, and SP-A. In these experiments IL-4 and IL-13 reduced expression of these innate factors in both HCs and patients with CRS. However, given that mucosal SP-A expression is increased in patients with CRSwNP, the significance of in vitro suppression of SP-A by IL-4/IL-13 is unclear.",

Activation of the receptor induces production of NO and increases ciliary beat frequency in sinus epithelial cells. A common polymorphism (TAS2R38 variant) was discovered that is associated with reduced signaling, NO production, and ciliary beat frequency and increased growth of P aeruginosa in air-liquid cultures of human airway epithelial cells. The effect of TAS2R38 on the killing of P aeruginosa was shown to be NO dependent. The TAS2R38 genotype correlated with the presence of sinonasal gram-negative infection in patients with CRS, suggesting a mechanistic link between a deficiency in innate signaling and increased bacterial infection.",

Colonizing fungi might play a role in maladaptive TH2 responses and thereby promote tissue eosinophilia. Colonization with enterotoxin-producing S aureus is a driver of the local TH2 response in patients with CRSwNP because it induces a local expansion of T lymphocytes and production of enterotoxin-specific IgE antibodies.",

There are few studies on the effectiveness of medical treatment alone at eradicating bacterial infection and bacterial biofilm in patients with CRS. Clinical trials of antifungal rinses have been generally unsuccessful. Surgical removal of diseased sinus tissue with restoration of sinus ventilation and use of culture-directed antibiotics remain the best approaches to treatment. There is hope that further elucidation of the genetic underpinnings of CRS and the host-microbial interactions present will provide greater insight into disease pathogenesis and more effective treatment.",
