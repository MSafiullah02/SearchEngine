As such, we have implemented modifications to our surgical criteria for patients who otherwise meet indications for operative intervention. This decision has been informed by both our internal discussions and the Society of Vascular Surgery Guidelines (Figure 1\n).13 Most patients with isolated descending thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms less than 6.5 cm and root, ascending or arch aneurysms less than 6.0 cm have been postponed until the surge has passed, which we anticipate will be in 2-3 months. Patients with both proximal aortic aneurysms (root, ascending, or arch) aneurysms and coronary artery disease or valve disease are being considered on a case-by-case basis. Symptomatic aortic stenosis with concomitant aortic aneurysm is classified as time-sensitive and we have proceeded with these procedures. Patients with subacute or chronic Type B aortic dissections who otherwise meet our criteria for TEVAR have similarly been delayed until after the surge passes. The locoregional impact of COVID-19 should be considered as each hospital system and aortic surgery practice develops an individualized approach to prioritization of scheduling. Clearly, hospitals with higher burdens of COVID-19 patients will likely be forced to impose stricter restrictions on elective surgical scheduling.",

Should patients be temporized with an expeditious strategy of stabilization through endovascular repair rather than a definitive open repair to decrease the length of stay and preserve scarce hospital resources? Should an anticipated need for personal protective equipment (PPE), blood products, or prolonged intubation or ICU stay in this time of constraint play a role in decision making? We recently treated a patient who presented with a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm by utilizing a temporizing TEVAR procedure rather than performing a more definitive, but more resource intensive, open repair. While we were able to achieve an adequate proximal seal in Zone 2 of the arch, we accepted a suboptimal distal landing zone within aneurysm thrombus in the supraceliac aorta (Figure 2\n). This approach stabilized the patient and reduced utilization of hospital resources. She was expeditiously discharged and we will perform the definitive repair once the surge of COVID-19 cases has abated.",

These layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) were disinfected in between the pre-procedural steps of intubation and central line insertion. They also utilized video laryngoscopy to allow the anesthesia providers to maintain maximum distance between themselves and the patient\u2019s oropharynx. Muscle relaxants and high-dose narcotics were administered before airway manipulation to minimize the risk of coughing and vomiting, which would aerosolize secretions and greatly increase the risk of virus transmission. They used tape to secure all seams in the PPE, including between the gloves and the gown and the mask and the goggles. These increased universal precautions should be utilized by the anesthesia team providing airway management for all patients requiring surgery who have known or suspected COVID-19. It is unclear whether this level of protection is necessary for the surgical team performing aortic surgery (after the airway manipulation portion of the procedure is completed), but increased precautions may be prudent for all members of the care team.",

At least three patients who met our criteria for elective aneurysm repair have decided, following appropriate shared medical decision-making efforts, to postpone their operations until they become symptomatic or the surge has passed. Each patient needs endovascular repair of an abdominal aneurysm, two juxtarenal, but they are > 60 years old and have underlying medical co-morbidities. They have elected to assume the risk of an aortic complication to avoid the risk of contracting COVID-19. Additionally, our hospital has implemented strict no-visitor policies in an effort to reinforce social distancing and decrease spread of the virus. This does not factor significantly into the physician decision making but has been a critical component of patient decision making.",

CMS recently waived the HIPAA-compliance regulations for multiple video and voice platforms and allowed for provider and health system reimbursement for telemedicine visits, greatly facilitating the expansion of these processes.15 Telemedicine is an ideal adjunct for clinical management of aortic disease, as these patients rarely have critical clinical decisions that rely on physical exam maneuvers that must be performed in person. We have transitioned the majority of our initial patient evaluations and routine surveillance clinic visits to the telemedicine platform. Routine post-operative visits are still being performed in person on a case-by-case basis, depending on the specific needs of each patient. Both patients and providers have appreciated this approach to minimize potential virus exposures while maintaining high quality clinical care. In fact, this may be one of the lasting impacts of the pandemic to clinical practice, particularly for patients who live far from a tertiary care center. Routine post-surgical follow-up or routine surveillance imaging can and is already often obtained locally but patients then drive 2-6 hours to be seen in person. Now that both patients and providers have experienced that this is not in fact necessary the likelihood of returning to the former practice model is low.",

In addition, aortic surgery patients have a relatively high utilization of post-acute care in skilled nursing facilities and inpatient rehab centers.16 These resources will likely be stressed by the coming influx of recovering COVID-19 patients, creating an impediment to discharge for patients following aortic surgery and further reducing hospital capacity.17\n",

A recent report from an acute care surgical program describes a practical prioritization framework for addressing this challenge.18 In our program, we have instituted a tiered prioritization model for all cardiovascular surgical patients, including patients with aortic disease. As new patients are referred or existing patients meet criteria for surgery, they are assigned a priority from 1 to 3 based on urgency and compiled into a master list. Given that our operating room block time is structured by service, the cardiac and vascular services have separate master lists. Our entire faculty meet (virtually) once a week to go over the list and agree upon prioritization of each patient in a rolling fashion so we can remain responsive to the changing hospital resource environment.",

We are fortunate to have a large dedicated cardiovascular ICU, but the ICU service is limited by number of beds and staff. To prevent complete saturation of the ICU service (and the resultant inability to perform elective surgery), we plan to alternate scheduling of patients with projected longer ICU stays with patients expected to recover more quickly. This approach will preserve ICU throughput and allow the most efficient clearance of our patient backlog. The decision-making model will be different in each regional and institutional environment, but multi-disciplinary collaboration with social workers, the blood bank, supply chain, and hospital staffing will be critical. Efforts to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d are already showing effect (Figure 3\n). The intended consequence of these mitigation efforts is that the increase in COVID-19 patients will have a prolonged and lower peak. If this strategy is successful, many regions will continue to experience resource limitations, not just in the short term but for many months. An understanding of local modeling of disease burden and system resources will be critical as we continue to evaluate and re-evaluate our patients who are currently in limbo. Success in flattening the curve will also mean that the devastating choices faced by clinicians in areas where this did not occur may be avoided. At this time we do not anticipate the need to palliate patients who would otherwise be treated due to lack of beds, ventilators, or PPE. We are still on the \u201cpre-peak\u201d part of our curve and this decision will be assessed by the Aortic Program faculty as necessary. There is no algorithm per se as the inputs are changing constantly. However, the Vascular Surgery Activity Condition or VASCCON model put forth by Dr. Forbes can be implemented using understanding of local conditions. 19 We currently receive a daily report and there is a live dashboard with important institutional data including number of COVID patients, patients under investigation, PPE supply chain, ventilator and ICU bed status, and ECMO capacity. This type of transparency will be critical for any institutions considering loosening or restricting current surgical care.",

Ideally, all relevant societies would draft such guidelines in a collaborative consensus-building manner, both to minimize differences in regional decision making as well as to provide a \u201cpandemic standard of care\u201d to protect physicians across specialties from medicolegal liability for outcomes related to resource constrained decision-making.

Given the high morbidity and mortality for untreated acute aortic syndrome, it seems clear that surgical treatment should be offered whenever possible to these patients. Decision making for elective or urgent aortic surgery is much more nuanced and will be best served with an institution and program-specific approach. By taking these collective measures, we as a specialty can continue to provide the best possible care for our patients in the context of our new shared reality.",
