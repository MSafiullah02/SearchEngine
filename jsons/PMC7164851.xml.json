The variety of modeling approaches discussed in this issue (deterministic compartmental modeling, individual-based network modeling, economic and cost-effectiveness modeling), as well as the breadth of applications (HIV, HCV, overdose) and settings (U.S., Canada, Mexico, Tanzania), highlights different examples of how modeling evidence is being used to improve the health of people who use drugs. From quantifying structural drivers of epidemics (such as criminalization and incarceration) to decisions about who pays for what, modeling continues to play an important role in informing and guiding evidence-based drug policy.",

Irvine and colleagues provide an important case study as to how modelers and policymakers collaborated to generate useful simulations of public health strategies to support the response to the opioid overdose crisis in British Columbia, Vancouver(Irvine et al., 2019). Colleagues from the Opioid Use Disorder Modeling writing group provide a commentary detailing the variety of uses for simulation models for considering the epidemic of opioid use disorder in the US, and interventions to tackle the epidemic(Group, 2020). Together, these pieces highlight the challenges this rapidly emerging situation poses to modeling, but the important role that modelers can play in informing public health strategies and policy. We hope that a coordinated effort amongst modeling teams occurs, each of whom can provide different methodological approaches and viewpoints on the problem, as well as facilitate data sharing. Indeed, these coordinated modeling and data sharing efforts have helped inform the public health understanding and response to HIV as well as, more recently, coronavirus(Eaton et al., 2014; Xu & Kraemer, 2020).",

The World Health Organization (WHO) elimination goal of 80% reduction in HCV incidence by 2030 underscores the urgent need to scale-up treatment and prevention interventions for PWID to prevent transmission and mortality(World Health Organization, 2016). Two studies in this issue examine the potential role of prison in the elimination response. Godin and colleagues find that prison-based testing and treatment could play an important role at reaching the WHO incidence target in Montreal, Canada(Godin, Kronfli, Cox, Alary, & Maheu-Giroux). Indeed, due to frequent incarceration and short sentences, scaling up prison-based testing and treatment in Montreal could reduce HCV incidence among all PWID by roughly 40% by 2030, with further impact being achieved if this is done in combination with improved harm reduction interventions.",

To reduce this risk, their analyses show that OST and NSP need to be scaled up in the community, combined with prison-based OST and retention on release. Importantly, they also find that decriminalization plus diversion to OST could prevent over half of new HCV infections in the next ten years, underscoring the substantial benefit that drug policy reform could have in the U.S.",

They additionally show that testing and treatment programs are likely to be cost-effective, with HCV core antigen (HCVcAg) testing potentially having greater impact compared to antibody and confirmatory PCR as a result of its simplified diagnostic process and resulting better retention in care.",

This will help validate these models and confirm that treatment of individuals can prevent transmission at a population level.

This helps to notice how modelled projections are having social and material impacts, including in policy, and through the numerical targets they generate. We agree with their call that closer collaboration between social scientists and modelers will allow for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how modeling influences policymaking, and our role as modelers in this process.",

Yet, the syndemics of substance use, incarceration, infectious disease transmission, and overdose are highly complex and overlapping(Singer, 2009). We hope that future models will stop focusing on single health outcomes, and increasingly consider the many forms of harm that result from injecting drug use as well as the multiple health benefits from interventions. Indeed, interventions such as OST can prevent HIV and HCV transmission, overdose, as well as reduce reincarceration and improve HIV treatment uptake and retention(Degenhardt et al., 2019). Models are well poised to incorporate these complex, and possibly synergistic, interactions to fully quantify the benefits of public health interventions for people who use or inject drugs(Degenhardt et al., 2019). This broader view could also help challenge the siloed funding Stuart and Wilson discuss, because most interventions have multiple benefits for this group.",
