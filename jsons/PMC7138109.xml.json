The world must unite and countries must establish resilient and sustainable health systems, ensuring that each individual is secure and receives the highest attainable standard of health. Japan has been a longstanding advocate of human security1 and has taken concrete action on the ground in support of this principle. Human security protects the vital core of all human lives in a way that enhances freedom, fulfilment, and capabilities1, 2 and underlies Japan's policy of Proactive Contribution to Peace. Japan regards health as an indispensable element of human security.1\n",

To catalyse such changes, leaders must commit to leave no one behind in the drive for the best attainable health gains. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have created an opportunity to connect sectors and empower individuals, families, and communities. It is crucial that we agree on a monitoring and evaluation framework so that the impact of UHC against investment is measurable and thus attainable.",

Japan is ready to support this reform process, including the launch of the Contingency Fund for Emergencies.6 Japan also fully supports the efforts of the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Facility, and calls for coordination between WHO and the World Bank to ensure the two mechanisms have supplementary and complementary roles so that they increase efficiency and effectiveness in crises responses.",

In the lead-up to Japan's G7 presidency in 2016, this conference is expected to highlight global preparedness for health emergencies, as well as explore resilient and sustainable health systems under the SDGs. In a world more interconnected than ever before, leaders must strive to unite rather than divide, and enhance human security and peace through the pursuit of health and wellbeing for all. With the G7 presidency in 2016, Japan is determined to contribute further to galvanise renewed momentum for global health so that all people can receive the basic quality services they need, and are protected from health threats, without financial hardship.
