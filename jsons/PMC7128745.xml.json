This fact could perhaps be part of the explanation about the behavior of this novel coronavirus concerning human infection. Preliminary genome sequencing suggested the snake as a likely wildlife reservoir responsible for the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection and origin-unknown homologous recombination identified within the spike glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV may explain snake-to-human cross-species transmission [2]. However, this theory has now been largely discounted and some researchers point towards bats as a reservoir and doubt that the coronavirus could have originated in animals other than birds or mammals [2]; they are skeptical that the animal host or hosts of 2019-nCoV can be identified without further field and laboratory research. Many hope that genetic tests of animals or environmental sources, such as cages and containers, from the Wuhan market will reveal clues [17] regarding the definite origin of the virus. The outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan is associated with exposures at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, suggesting a possible zoonosis.",

WHO reported an increase in the number of confirmed and suspected cases and affected provinces. The case fatality rate of the currently reported cases is less than 3% (170 deaths, including one case in a healthcare professional), which implies that so far, this novel coronavirus does not seem to cause the high fatality rates previously observed for SARS and MERS-CoV, 10% and 37%, respectively [20]. Of the confirmed cases, 25% are reported to be severe and underlying comorbidities were detected in many of them and elderly. The Chinese government declared the death of the first health professional who provided assistance at Wuhan hospital. Remarkably, WHO has reported that in the last one week, less than 15% of new cases reported had visited the Huanan market. Health care workers have also been infected. Fourth-generation cases in Wuhan and second-generation cases outside Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province, could be traced back [21].

The WHO Emergency Committee met on January 23rd and although the situation at that time is not considered to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), WHO monitors the situation closely and can, under the global legal framework, the revised International Health Regulations (IHR), recommend travel and trade restrictions when these are deemed necessary. At the moment of proofs correction of this editorial, the Committee was about to be convened again (Jan. 30, 2020) in order to reassess the situation and if declare the PHEIC. An estimate of R0 of 1.4\u20132.5 was presented [23]. Other estimates, however, yield higher R0 figures. As researchers are saying, sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is one of the most important topics issues that could explain the scale of the Wuhan outbreak. Considering this, it is not only important to follow the progression of the epidemic closely but to also coordinate the countries' mechanisms to mitigate the impact in health care services and the community [23]. There are no known useful treatments for the disease caused by this new coronavirus; therefore, contact and respiratory precautions are the only effective measures to prevent this emerging coronavirus [23].",

Moreover, both outbreaks were initially connected to \u201cwet markets\u201d where game animals and meat were sold [19]. In the case of SARS, the person-to-person transmission was efficient and super-spreading events led to significant outbreaks in hotels and hospitals. Learning from the SARS outbreak, which started as animal-to-human transmission during the first phase of the epidemic, all game meat trades should be optimally regulated to terminate this portal of transmission [19]. Emerging and reemerging pathogens are global challenges for public health and a matter for concerns in travelers from all over the world. As in previous scenarios [24,25], the Latin American Society for Travel Medicine (SLAMVI), is concerned for travelers arriving from China and other affected locations that would bring the 2019-nCoV but also given the potential exposure for travelers from this region to China and other attractive countries, that may hold mass gathering events in the upcoming weeks, such as the upcoming 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan to be celebrated on July 24-August 9, 2020 [26], even more, when up to date, this country has also confirmed China-imported cases (4).\n",
