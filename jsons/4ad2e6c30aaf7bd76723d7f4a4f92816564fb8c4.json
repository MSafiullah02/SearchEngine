World newspapers reveal high numbers of infected doctors and an alarming number of deaths. According to data from the British Medical Journal (BMJ), as of April 5, 2000, 198 physician's deaths had been reported worldwide due to the coronavirus. Among the countries with the highest mortality are Italy with 73 and Iran with 43 deceased doctors, respectively. Among these, the vast majority were men (90%). 5 Recently, the JAMA journal reported more than 3000 infected health professionals in China, and more than 22 deceased. 6 The Argentinian newspaper Mundo reported on April 13 more than 4824 infected physicians in Italy. The New York Times reported on March 24, 2020 that in Spain, the total number of infected amounts to date to more than 40,000, with almost 14% (5400) being health professionals. In Colombia, as of April 15, the first 4 physicians have died from COVID-19 and others are still in intensive care.",

Recent studies of Covid-19 showed GI tropism of the coronavirus, verified by the detection of the virus in biopsy specimens and stool, even in discharged patients. This may provide some explanations for the GI symptoms, potential recurrence, and transmission of Covid-19 from persistently shedding humans. 9-10 A study performed by Chen Y et al 11 analyzed 42 laboratory confirmed Covid-19 patients, finding that 8 (19.05%) had GI symptoms, and 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in the feces after the pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from the feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 6 to 10 days. These findings suggest a possible transmission via the fecal-oral route. Even though this route of transmission has not been confirmed or discarded, it seems safer to prevent any kind of contamination during lower GI procedures.",

We show an economical and easily achievable antiaerosol barrier design that protects the group involved in upper and lower digestive endoscopy procedures. Even though we have not used this barrier in ERCP, we think it is possible to use it, surrounding the head with the barrier while confirming that the oxygen cannula remains in place all the time, if the patient is not under general anesthesia. Cardiopulmonary monitoring is always necessary during any procedure performed with this barrier.",

All of the protection described in the PPE guidelines must be used. 3. The plastic barrier described is a protection method that allows the aerosols to be isolated to reduce contamination of the group that performs the procedure. 4. The barrier is low cost, easy to install, and can be generalized in all public and private institutions due to its cost effectiveness. 5. The barrier can be used in upper endoscopic procedures like EGD, EUS, ERCP, and lower digestive endoscopy procedures. Once the tape is placed with the hole created, it is lubricated to facilitate the entry of endoscopic equipment After placing the oxygen cannula, the oral protector and after explaining it to the patient, the barrier is set on the patient's head, fixing the posterior edge below the patient's head, and the anterior edge to the anterior end of the stretcher. . . . The barrier should remain in place until the end of the procedure. Aerosols can be seen in the plastic. The oral protector with the plastic in place is removed, and a wrapping maneuver is performed from the front to the back to avoid peripheral contamination. Once a sphere is formed with the plastic, it is covered with the gloves used for the enveloping maneuver and they are discarded. Double glove is required.",
