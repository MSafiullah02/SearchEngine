            "text": "Human rhinovirus (RV) is commonly associated with severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children. We aimed to describe the distribution of RV species and associations between RV species and clinical features in children hospitalized with clinically severe pneumonia (CSP) in Morocco. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from 700 children, 2-59 months of age, admitted with CSP to the H\u00f4pital d'Enfants de Rabat in Morocco. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 92% of children, of which RV was the most common (53%). PCR assays, sequencing, and phylogenetic tree analyses were carried out on 183 RV-positive NPAs to determine RV species and genotypes. Of 157 successfully genotyped NPAs, 60 (38.2%) were RV-A, 8 (5.1%) were RV-B, and 89 (56.7%) were RV-C. Wheezing and cyanosis were more common in RV-C-positive than RV-A-positive children (80.9% vs. 56.7%; P \u00bc 0.001 for wheezing and 10.1% vs. 0%; P \u00bc 0.011 for cyanosis). Physician's discharge diagnosis of pneumonia was more frequent among RV-A-positive (40.0%) than RV-C-positive children (20.2%; P \u00bc 0.009). RV-A and RV-C showed distinct seasonal patterns. Our findings suggest that RV-C is associated with wheezing illness while RV-A is associated with pneumonia.",

Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of ALRI, of which human rhinovirus (RV) is often the most commonly identified [Hayden, 2004] . Advances in molecular diagnosis techniques led to the identification of a third, previously unidentified species, RV-C, in 2006 [Lamson et al., 2006; McErlean et al., 2007] . Although several studies have since investigated the prevalence of RV-C in children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, these studies have largely been limited to developed countries. The majority of studies investigating all three RV species in children hospitalized with ALRI found that RV-C is the most prevalent RV species and is often associated with more severe illness [Arden et al., 2006; Lamson et al., 2006; Renwick et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2009; Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009a, b; Bizzintino et al., 2011] .",

Seven hundred children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided parent/guardian consent were included in the study. Recruited children underwent standardized procedures including anteroposterior chest X-ray, pulse oximetry (Bionics palm care), and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) for identification of respiratory viruses. Radiologically confirmed end-point pneumonia was defined as episodes with evidence of consolidation and/or pleural effusion.",

The current findings are important as they show that the two RV species produce distinctly different clinical patterns in children with an acute respiratory illness that fulfills the WHO diagnostic criteria of CSP. RV-A is associated with an illness that more closely resembles bacterial pneumonia and RV-C is more likely to be associated with airway symptoms. These findings are consistent with previous reports showing that RV-A is be more likely to be associated with fever and less likely to be associate with wheeze than RV-C [Miller et al., 2009a, b] . However, in the setting of the WHO diagnosis of CSP, clearly further studies are needed to determine the prevalence and severity of bacterial co-infections and the presence of viral co-infections. Our findings should help in the interpretation of other RV studies from Africa. The three existing such studies have shown varying RV-A versus RV-C prevalences;",

            "text": "This study was part of a series of comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory analyses describing Moroccan children admitted to hospital with CSP. Hence, associations between RV species and epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings were investigated in Moroccan children for the first time. Physician's attributed discharge diagnosis of pneumonia was more common among RV-A-positive than RV-C-positive children while wheeze was less common among RV-A-positive than RV-C-positive children. RV-C was the most common RV species and wheeze was more common among RV-C than RV-A cases, and these findings have been supported by studies from around the world [McErlean et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2009a, b; Bizzintino et al., 2011] including a study from the Middle East [Miller et al., 2009a, b] . Although Miller et al. found RV-A to be the most common identified species overall in children with respiratory symptoms and/or fever, only RV-C was associated with wheeze. In contrast, in two studies from China [Xiang et al., 2010] and Italy [Esposito et al., 2012b] of childhood pneumonia, RV-A was more common than RV-C, identified in about half the children compared with RV-C, only being identified in 38% and 31% of children, respectively. Hence, RV-C is likely to play a more important role in asthma and wheeze type illness while RV-A plays a more important role in pneumonia. However, this conclusion may also be challenged by findings from this study that radiologically confirmed end-point pneumonia was equally common between RV-A-and RV-C-positive children.",

In addition to wheeze, cyanosis was more common among RV-C-positive than RV-A-positive children. Miller et al. reported that children in Jordan with RV-C were more likely to require supplemental oxygen and less likely to report otalgia (ear pain) and suggested that RV-C was more virulent than RV-A [Miller et al., 2009a, b] . The association between RV-C and supplemental oxygen reported by Miller et al. concurs with the finding in this study that RV-C was associated with cyanosis. This study reported relatively low prevalence of hypoxemia (3-6%) in both RV-A-and RV-C-positive children, despite high oxygen provision during admission (72-85%). Such a contrast may arise from the fact that oxygen administration at the hospital is very common and proactive, generally starting upon admission, while performing most of the procedures related to canalizing a vein and/or administering the first doses of inhaled bronchodilators. With the exception of wheeze, cyanosis, and axillary temperature, clinical features between children with different RV species were similar, suggesting that many clinical features overlap between the species. Similarly, other studies have also reported no differences in clinical features or severity of illness between RV species [Luchsinger et al., 2014] .",

Firstly, contemporaneous healthy controls were not included in the analysis to compare the distribution of RV species between sick and healthy children. Previous studies from developing countries have reported RV identification rates of up to 40% in non-respiratory controls [Chidlow et al., 2012] . Secondly, using NPAs, viruses identified in the upper airway may not be entirely representative of the lower airway. However, the use of NPAs for studying lower respiratory disease is widely accepted given the difficulties of obtaining lower respiratory tract samples. Furthermore, utilizing molecular methods to detect RV in NPAs does not allow differentiation to be made between pathogenic and non-pathogenic infection. Even in the absence of other viruses, identification of RV suggests but does not prove RV was the causative agent. Further investigations of viruses present in lower respiratory samples as well as identification of more bacteria in the respiratory tract could contribute to better understanding of the pathogenesis of RV. Finally, the study population comprised a group of WHO-defined CSP cases admitted to a hospital and, hence, our findings may not be representative of respiratory illness overall. Nonetheless, this study provides data on the distribution of RV species in Morocco for the first time, with important findings on the associations between RV-A and pneumonia and RV-C and wheeze.",
