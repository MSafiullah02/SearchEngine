            "text": "The ferret is a well-established small animal model for the study of the infectivity, pathogenesis and transmission of both human and avian influenza viruses (Belser et al., 2011). In addition, the recent emergence of a number of novel zoonotic viral pathogens with the potential for causing fatal disease in human hosts has extended the biomedical significance of this species. Infection of ferrets with severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) recapitulates a number of the clinical and pathophysiological signs observed in human infections, including viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and significant lung damage (Chu et al., 2008, See et al., 2008, Martina et al., 2003). The related paramyxoviruses, Hendra and Nipah, exhibit a broad host range and cause acute respiratory infection and severe encephalitis associated with high mortality in humans (Vigant and Lee, 2011). Ferrets infected with either virus exhibit a disease pathology very similar to that observed in humans, characterised by widespread vasculitis, and severe respiratory and neurological disease (Bossart et al., 2009, Pallister et al., 2011). More recently, the ferret has been shown to recapitulate signs of human disease signs when infected with different species of ebolavirus (Cross et al., 2016), further demonstrating that the ferret provides a robust model for the evaluation of preventative and passive immune protection from infection.",

            "text": "Despite the importance of the ferret as a model for human viral diseases, research using the ferret has been hampered by a lack of ferret-specific immunological reagents to explore the cellular immune system. To date, the identification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognise ferret immune cell markers and cytokines has relied largely on screens of antibodies in other species that cross-react with the ferret counterpart (Martel and Aasted, 2009, Rutigliano et al., 2008). While this approach has been successful in identifying antibodies that recognise, for example, CD8 (Rutigliano et al., 2008), gaps remain in the repertoire of available reagents. A number of studies have been published that describe the use of ferret-specific CD4 mAbs to monitor changes in the level of CD4 T lymphocytes in ferrets in response to different viral infections (Cheng et al., 2013, Music et al., 2016, Music et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2013). Most recently, DiPiazza et al. (2016) used both CD4 and CD8 specific reagents to look at changes in the antigen-specific T cell repertoire following influenza infection in ferrets. As the ferret is becoming a commonly used model for highly pathogenic virus studies such as Ebola virus, further characterisation with regards to phenotypic and functional aspects of the ferret CD4 T cell population are needed. Furthermore, reagents that can detect the antigen following virus inactivation are critical. In the current study, we describe the derivation and characterisation of a ferret CD4 specific mAb that is well-suited for studies involving infectious material.",

Briefly, CD1 mice were immunised intraperitoneally with ferret CD4 protein (10 \u03bcg/injection) in a water-in-oil emulsion (Sigma) containing CpG, three times at two week intervals. Two weeks after the third immunisation a serum sample was taken and the antibody titre assessed using a conventional ELISA format using antigen-coated wells. Once a serum titre of three-fold higher than background (pre-bleed) was reached, a final boost immunisation was given followed four days prior to euthanasia and splenectomy. The spleen cells were homogenised into a single cell suspension between two frosted glass slides and 100 \u00d7 106 spleen cells were mixed with 25 \u00d7 106 SP2/0 cells. These cells were washed in DMEM and 1 mL of polyethylene glycol was added drop-wise over a one minute period follow by additional washes in DMEM. The cells were plated into 20 \u00d7 96 well plates and allowed to divide for two weeks. At this point the supernatant from each well was tested for reactivity against the immunogen by protein microarray using antigen-coated slides and further confirmed by ELISA, and positive binders were expanded, subcloned until clonal and frozen. The production and purification of the FeCD4 was undertaken in pleated-surface roller bottles in Hybridoma-serum free media (Gibco) supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS at 37 \u00b0C for 10 days. The resultant medium was filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter and applied to a Protein A Sepharose column (Fast Flow 4; GE) and antibody fraction eluted with 50 mM glycine, pH 3.0, into tubes containing 0.2 elution volumes of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.

This served a dual purpose of demonstrating that the FeCD4 binds CD4 T cells, in addition to providing a profile of the ferret T cell population in the ferret immune compartment. The expression of the CD4 protein when analysed with CD8 in many species displays a very distinct staining pattern in the thymus, comprised predominantly of double-positive immature thymocytes (Chidgey et al., 2008). In the ferret thymus, the majority of the CD4 positive cells were also CD8 positive (74%), with the remaining 10% of CD4+ cells being CD8\u2212 and approximately 7% of the thymus being CD8 single-positive (Fig. 4\n). As might be expected, none of the remaining tissues (LN, spleen and blood) had significant numbers of CD4+\n CD8+ cells but predominantly displayed CD4/8 single-positive profiles. The single-positive proportions of CD8 T cells were 16, 10 and 9% and the single-positive CD4 T cell proportions were 26, 27 and 30% for LN, spleen and PBMCs, respectively (data not shown). Interestingly, there was a population of CD8lowCD4\u2212 cells present in the spleen. The forward scatter (size) vs. side scatter (granularity) of these cells suggests that they may be monocytes (data not shown). This would not be unexpected, as many monocyte populations in humans and mice express CD8, including dendritic cells (Gibbings and Befus, 2009).",

We co-stained cells with the CD4 antibody and with anti-ferret Ig and cross-reactive anti-mouse CD11b, anti-bovine MHC class II and anti-human CD81 (Fig. 5\n). As expected, the anti-Ig (B cells) and the anti-CD11b antibodies bound a separate population of cells to that of the CD4 mAb. In the ferret LN we observed a very low proportion of CD11b positive cells, possibly due to mechanical not enzymatic digestion. Interestingly, a small subset (5%) of LN cells expressed both MHC class II and CD4. This is consistent with findings that many dendritic cells as well as some activated T cells from other mammals co-express these markers (Vremec et al., 2000), suggesting a possible mechanism for sub-setting antigen-presenting cells in the ferret, with the majority of the MHC class II cells being B cells in the LN. Additionally, we show here for the first time the ability for an anti-human CD81 mAb to cross-react with ferret LN cells. The majority of LN cells display low expression of CD81, as is expected as CD81 is well-known to be present on the surface of B cells. Interestingly, the majority of CD4 T cells in the ferret (22%) were negative for the CD81 marker, however a subset (6%) were positive for both CD4 and CD81. CD81 has been shown to be an important co-stimulator of T cells, in particular driving a Th2 function (Deng et al., 2000). Our data indicates a possible mechanism for distinguishing differentially activated CD4 T cells in the ferret.",

Palacios (1982) demonstrated that ConA activation of CD4 T cells does not require MHCII interaction but rather directly stimulates receptors for activation, later shown to be TRPM2 and TRPC3 (Palacios, 1982, Pang et al., 2012). In Fig. 6\n, we show that CD4 and CD8 T cells sorted from ferret LN, using the FeCD4 and OKT8 antibodies, respectively, are able to initiate an IFN\u03b3 response to ConA as measured by ELISpot.

Cell-mediated immunity has been shown to be of critical importance in influenza infections, however, to date, the majority of our understanding has come from mouse models and mouse-adapted strains of the virus (Thomas et al., 2006). This includes the priming of Th1 and Th2 cells to stimulate cytotoxic T cells and B cells responses (Justewicz et al., 1995) as well as CD4 T cell memory (Strutt et al., 2010). As it has been shown numerous times, the impact of using mouse-adapted virus in inbred strains of mice may convolute these findings. In order to study the ability of influenza A viruses to stimulate CD4 cells in a situation that more closely resemble that of human-adapted viruses, the use of FeCD4 mAb and the functional output of IFN\u03b3 will be highly valuable for future studies.",

As such, we wanted to determine if our antibody could bind the CD4 antigen following fixation. Previous reports have used a range of 2\u20134% PFA to inactivate infectious material (Takada et al., 2007), therefore ferret LN cells were treated with 4% PFA for 2 h both before and after staining with the FeCD4 antibody. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percentage of cells stained against unfixed samples stained with the same mAb were compared. There was no significant difference between the proportion of cells stained with CD4 if the samples were stained before or after fixation (Fig. 7\n) when compared to no fixation. Furthermore, there was no difference in MFI of the CD4 positive cell population. As the ferret has been shown to be a suitable small animal model for a number of human viruses it may be pertinent to decontaminate (PFA fix) cells early in the experimental protocol. Recently, Cross et al. published the use of ferrets as a suitable model to study Ebola virus infection (Cross et al., 2016) without the need for virus adaptation as required for other small animal models (Cross et al., 2015). With BSL4 pathogens there in an increased difficulty in undertaking flow cytometric experiments and therefore our FeCD4 mAb, which is able to phenotype ferret immune cells post-decontamination, may be more convenient for studies of highly pathogenic viruses in ferrets.",

In this paper we have built upon other recent publications that have sort to identify novel reagents for the ferret and have further characterised these reagents to ensure they are binding their cognate antigen. The FeCD4 mAb will now serve as a ferret-specific reagent to allow detailed immunological studies of the response to viral infections such as Ebola and Influenza. The fact that FeCD4 can recognise fixed antigen enhances the versatility of this reagent for use in circumstances that involve biohazardous entities.",
