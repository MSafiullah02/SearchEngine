Infectiousness is assumed to intensify in the later and more severe stages of Ebola virus disease, when infectious individuals are confined at home or in the health-care setting, and exposed to a restricted number of caregivers. The resulting contact network is highly clustered, giving rise to a slow and local mode of dissemination,9 a pattern that homogeneous-mixing models have been unable to capture. Long-distance transmission events (eg, during unsafe funerals) are predicted to be uncommon; instead, the slow geographic spread of Ebola virus disease is best explained by distance travelled to reach a hospital.9 This point is interesting, because several long-distance transmission events were key in the dissemination of the infection to neighbouring countries (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal) and other continents (Europe [Spain], North America [USA]).2\n",

The rapid establishment of new Ebola treatment units was a key step to curb the epidemic in Liberia, although the model assumes near perfect isolation of infectious individuals in Ebola treatment units, which could be overly optimistic. Distribution of household protection kits and implementation of safe burial procedures were also associated with significant reduction in Ebola virus disease transmission. Of note, other interventions not explicitly modelled could have played a part, including use of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment units, which reduces the delay from presentation to isolation, and changes in population behaviour in response to mass education campaigns and accumulation of Ebola virus disease cases.11 Some of these effects could have been absorbed in the model by Merler and colleagues9 through the estimated effect of household protection kits.",

Ideally, future models should integrate more realistic population mobility patterns derived from cellphone usage data (eg, flowminder), proxies of social behaviour, and differences in reporting and hospitalisation rates between rural and urban areas.

By contrast, incidence has remained relatively stable in Guinea, whereas the epidemic continues to ascend quickly in Sierra Leone (figure). Difficulties in building and staffing Ebola treatment units could explain the worrisome turn of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. A key test of the robustness of the model by Merler and colleagues will be whether it can reproduce the highly distinct dynamics of Ebola virus disease in different countries. In the longer run, microsimulations and other modelling approaches could prove instrumental to optimise interventions to curb and ultimately eliminate Ebola virus disease in the region, especially as an Ebola vaccine might materialise in the near future.",
