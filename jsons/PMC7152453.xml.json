This was the single most common type of cancer reported among liver transplant recipients in the recent review by Sampaio et al.2 PTLD differs from lymphomas seen in immunocompetent patients in that it may present outside of nodal tissue, tends to arise (and regress) rapidly, and is frequently driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Indeed, the greatest risk for PTLD is seen in EBV-seronegative patients who receive an EBV-seropositive organ. Thus PTLD may reasonably be considered an infectious disease risk with oncological sequelae rather than a case of direct oncological transformation. Accordingly, PTLD responds to reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression in approximately 50% of affected individuals, making prompt and aggressive reduction of immunosuppression the first therapeutic maneuver upon diagnosis. In a long-term follow-up study of liver transplant patients at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the overall incidence of PTLD was 3.1% with EBV-negative disease predominating later after transplantation (Fig. 97-1\n).3\n",

Laboratory findings typically include an elevated l-lactate dehydrogenase level and EBV viremia. Graft involvement and central nervous system invasion, as well as multiple site involvement, are poor prognostic factors. Diagnosis requires biopsy-proven disease of the affected organ or lymph node. Oncological evaluation is required. An elevated EBV level on polymerase chain reaction, although not diagnostic, may be suggestive of PTLD and can be used to gauge its course. Treatment consists primarily of immunosuppression withdrawal, allowing the patient to mount a response against EBV and PTLD. In addition, antiviral directed therapy (e.g., ganciclovir) is started. When withdrawal is insufficient, adjuvant therapies, including irradiation and chemotherapy, may be considered, typically CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin [doxorubicin], Oncovin [vincristine], and prednisone)-based regimens.",

The vast majority of infections occur within the first 6 months after transplantation, when the intensity of immunosuppression is at its highest. However, infections may happen at any time and generally occur in a predictable pattern after transplant (Table 97-2\n).4 Common and life-threatening opportunistic infections are addressed in detail in Chapter 78. Long term, the risk for infection persists and is still directly related to a patient\u2019s level of immunosuppression. Thus patients undergoing treatment for rejection remain at a high risk for infection, even after therapy has ceased. Although serious bacterial and fungal infections predominate early after transplantation, viral conditions prevail over the long term. These include reactivation of latent herpes viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. The relationship of these reactivations leads many to reinstitute viral-specific prophylaxis when treating for rejection (e.g., ganciclovir).",

The primary approach for all these conditions includes reduction of immunosuppression in addition to targeted antiviral therapy against hepatitis C. Nearly 100 antiviral agents have been developed against hepatitis C, which are in various experimental phases. The two recently approved agents, boceprevir and telaprevir, are both protease inhibitors that, when used in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, have been shown to improve cure rates with a shorter duration of therapy.",

Specific issues common to patients recovering from hepatic failure include hypogammaglobulinemia and leukocytopenia and should be recognized as clues to limit the immunosuppressive load. Maneuvers to thwart any potential infection after transplantation include (1) treating any donor-related infections, (2) taking precautions against health care\u2013associated bacterial infections (i.e., surgical site, catheter-associated, and urinary tract infections; ventilator-assisted pneumonias), and (3) providing prophylaxis against potential opportunistic infections via the routine use of antimicrobials such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amphotericin, and ganciclovir.",

The mechanisms resulting in hyperglycemia include (1) a reduction in insulin production, (2) an increase in gluconeogenesis, (3) a decrease in peripheral glucose utilization, and (4) reduced glycogen synthesis. These effects are thought to be dose dependent, because reduced doses of CS have been shown to decrease insulin resistance.8 In addition, CSs enhance appetite, particularly for sweetened foods. As will be described later, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) contribute significantly to the development of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Even though many programs have employed steroid avoidance or low-maintenance-dose CS protocols, PTDM remains a considerable problem. Thus one can extrapolate that PTDM is primarily due to the CNI.",

Recent comparisons of AZA to MMF have resulted in favorable evaluations of the former. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing both agents in kidney transplantation showed a lesser occurrence of GI-adverse events (diarrhea, emesis, and abdominal pain), leukopenia and anemia, and CMV infections in the AZA groups, with similar rates of malignancies for AZA and MMF.48 In another review comparing both agents in liver transplantation, Germani et al49 found no significant benefit of MMF over AZA as an antirejection agent (when used with CyA). Interestingly, in this study the rate of hepatitis C virus recurrence and its severity were more frequently reported with AZA, a finding already noted by Wiesner et al50 in an international, multicenter comparative study of AZA and MMF.",

Since its release, studies have confirmed therapeutic equivalence when compared to MMF.52 More importantly, a benefit in GI-related symptoms has been overwhelmingly shown.53., 54.\n",

Because MMF and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium are usually prescribed in conjunction with other agents, they have not been strongly implicated with an increased incidence of infection. However, in patients using MPA for psoriasis there were multiple reported cases of herpes zoster reactivation.55., 56. This has also been documented among kidney transplant recipients receiving MPA.57 In a study from Spain, among 33 adult liver transplant patients on MMF monotherapy, the most common adverse effect was a herpes simplex infection.58 Thus there may be a link between MMF use and varicella infection. In general, MMF is a safe and effective agent in the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Unlike other agents, long-term toxicities are not cumulative.\n",

As a result it has been used increasingly in recent years to prevent rejection in organ transplant recipients. Conversely, there are concerns about the risks for infection and malignancy due to its mechanism of action. In a review of 547 patients receiving various organ transplants (liver transplants, N = 54 [10%]) at the University of Pittsburgh, alemtuzumab used in the treatment of rejection was shown to cause more opportunistic infections (namely CMV) than alemtuzumab used for induction therapy.66 In a multicenter study on kidney transplantation, alemtuzumab was evaluated against patients receiving conventional therapy (i.e., rabbit ATG or basiliximab induction). The incidence of malignancy was higher in the alemtuzumab group (P = .03), and the rate of serious adverse infectious events with alemtuzumab was greater when compared to basiliximab (35% versus 22%, P = .02), but similar compared to ATG.67 In liver transplantation there is scant literature on the long-term effects of this antibody. However, a recent retrospective study on non\u2013hepatitis C recipients receiving alemtuzumab found a greater incidence of infections, specifically viral, when compared to those who did not receive induction.68 The incidence of malignancy was not different between the groups.",
