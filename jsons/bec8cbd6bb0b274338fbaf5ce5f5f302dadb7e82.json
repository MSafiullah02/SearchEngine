Because they are transmitted to humans from non-human animals, the transmission dynamics of zoonoses are necessarily influenced by the ecology of their animal hosts and vectors. The 'dilution effect' proposes that increased species diversity reduces disease risk, suggesting that conservation and public health initiatives can work synergistically to improve human health and wildlife biodiversity. However, the meta-analysis that we present here indicates a weak and highly heterogeneous relationship between host biodiversity and disease. Our results suggest that disease risk is more likely a local phenomenon that relies on the specific composition of reservoir hosts and vectors, and their ecology, rather than patterns of species biodiversity.",

Zoonotic transmission is inherently a multi-species phenomenon, often also involving vector intermediaries, making an understanding of underlying ecological processes essential for management and control. Indeed, a key question in disease ecology and epidemiology is how to mitigate or ameliorate pathogen transmission from wildlife reservoirs to human populations. The 'dilution effect' hypothesis, which suggests that disease risk will decrease as a result of increased species diversity, offers an intriguing possibility of harnessing conservation initiatives in order to reduce disease risk to human populations (Pongsiri et al. 2009; Keesing et al. 2010 ). Here, we use the inclusive definition of the dilution effect which describes the net effect of species diversity reducing disease risk by any of a variety of mechanisms (Keesing et al. 2006) . For example, Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, is transmitted by ticks (Ixodes spp.), but persists in vertebrate hosts (e.g. white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, Sorex shrews and other species), which differ in the degree to which they can infect ticks (i.e. reservoir competence) (LoGiudice et al. 2003; Brisson et al. 2008) . The risk of human exposure to Lyme disease is therefore strongly influenced by the local abundance and interactions of tick hosts, Borrelia reservoir hosts, and Ixodes ticks. LoGiudice et al. (2003 LoGiudice et al. ( , 2008 have hypothesised that a higher diversity of hosts for ticks could reduce the risk of Lyme disease. Similarly, reservoir competence of mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV) varies widely among avian species (Komar et al. 2003) , and higher avian biodiversity (species richness and evenness) has been postulated to reduce WNV risk (e.g. Ezenwa et al. 2006; Swaddle & Calos 2008; Allan et al. 2009 ). Unlike WNV and B. burgdorferi, hantaviruses are generally associated with only a single species of rodent host, and transmission does not involve vectors, but a negative association between host diversity and hantavirus prevalence has nevertheless been proposed via mechanisms such as a higher biodiversity suppressing the encounter rate within a reservoir species, and therefore dampening intraspecific disease transmission (Clay et al. 2009; Dizney & Ruedas 2009; Carver et al. 2011) .",

There are other studies that ask related questions for non-human diseases, but our primary interest was the possible relationship between public health and wildlife biodiversity. Studies were only selected if they simultaneously provided field-based measures of disease risk (e.g. prevalence of infection in animal, human or vector populations; density of infected animals, humans or vectors) and measures of wildlife biodiversity [e.g. species richness (number of species present) or a diversity index (Shannon's index, Simpson's index, etc.)]. Studies most frequently involved multiple sites across which biodiversity varied, but we also included one study that examined disease prevalence in the presence and absence of a particular species (voles) over time (Carver et al. 2011) , and one study where non-reservoirs were removed (Suz an et al. 2009) . Where studies presented data on different subsets of biodiversity, we used the most complete representations of species richness, as this criterion can be applied consistently across all studies. For example, all bird species combined, rather than separate analyses of passerines or non-passerines (Ezenwa et al. 2006) ; or the 'whole model' rather than separate analyses of small mammals, large mammals or birds (LoGiudice et al. 2008) . For studies that examined multiple measures of disease risk [e.g. seroprevalence and abundance of seropositive animals (Piudo et al. 2011)] , we chose the disease risk measure most consistently used across the study system [e.g. seroprevalence was used in most other hantavirus studies, so seroprevalence was adopted from Piudo et al.

If there is no publication bias, effect sizes from studies with larger sample sizes will be near the average, whereas effect sizes from smaller sample sizes will spread on both sides of the average. That is, unbiased data should be shaped like a funnel, whereas biased data will generate an asymmetric funnel plot (Chaplin-Kramer et al. 2011) . We also tested for the effect of potential publication bias by using the trim-and-fill method (Duval & Tweedie 2000a,b) , implemented in the R package meta. This intuitively appealing method allows the imputation of possible missing effect-size estimates based on inferred publication bias. In the case of publication bias, confidence intervals are likely to be systematically under-estimated since the variance of the low-power samples (i.e. the bottom right of our funnel plot) is truncated by the missing samples. In trim-and-fill method, confidence intervals for the overall effect size are recalculated including imputed values. Confidence intervals for the trim-and-fill method are calculated using a normal approximation. A sample not subject to publication bias should show little change in the estimated confidence intervals from the original sample to the augmented sample. The trim-and-fill approach also allows rank-based estimates (R 0 + and L 0 + ) of the probable number of missing studies due to publication bias, rounded to the nearest integer as recommended (Duval & Tweedie 2000a,b) . Because this is a question of publication bias, we calculate this value for both our complete sample (which includes three unpublished studies) and the sub-sample of only published papers (n = 13).",

Finally, there is a pronounced asymmetry to the funnel, with more highly negative results at the lowest sample sizes. This is suggestive that either (1) small studies that do not support the dilution effect hypothesis are not published or (2) that there is unmeasured heterogeneity in the studies.

Although the mean effect size is negative, the confidence interval around the mean crosses zero, so the null hypothesis of no effect cannot be rejected. Furthermore, there is strong evidence for heterogeneity in the effects, suggesting that different processes are acting on the different studies. We conclude that the relationship between biodiversity and zoonotic disease risk is probably idiosyncratic, and that understanding the ecological dynamics of specific disease systems is more important in predicting zoonotic disease risk.",

            "text": "A challenge in assessing the evidence in support of the dilution effect is the differences between disease systems and/or variable measures of disease risk. For example, we used two studies examining Lyme disease: LoGiudice et al. (2008) determined risk by nymphal infection prevalence (NIP, i.e. proportion of ticks infected with B. burgdorferi), whereas Prusinski et al. (2006) measured B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in mammalian hosts. Lyme disease risk can also be measured as density of infected nymphs (DIN), and the implications of the dilution effect are starkly different depending on the risk measure adopted: for instance, a reduction in nymphal infection prevalence associated with increased host biodiversity may be negated if higher host biodiversity increases vector density (Schmidt & Ostfeld 2001; Salkeld & Lane 2010; Wood & Lafferty 2012) , which is why several studies suggest that DIN is a more direct measure of risk to humans. Similarly, in Argentina, host species diversity and evenness was not correlated with Andes virus (a hantavirus) antibody seroprevalence in the reservoir hostthe long-tailed colilargo, Oligoryzomys longicaudatusbut there was a correlation between species diversity and the abundance of antibodypositive O. longicaudatus (Piudo et al. 2011) . We recommend reporting data on both prevalence and density of infection (in vectors and/or vertebrate hosts) so that public health agencies can interpret how biodiversity affects these key components of disease risk. Parallel issues arise when attempting to interpret measures of biodiversity: is species richness, evenness or some index the best indicator of community biodiversity?",

In contrast, mammal diversity at a global scale has been linked to increased likelihood of emerging zoonotic pathogens (Jones et al. 2008) . We believe that these studies should be interpreted with caution given that vertebrate diversity, incidence of zoonoses, vector feeding ecology and infection rates are often recorded at different times or spatial scales and rely on disparate sources of data. That is, disease transmission can operate at fine spatial scales and data at coarse county or region levels may not be indicative of local pathogen transmission patterns (Loss et al. 2009; Hamer et al. 2011) . When data from larger aggregates are used to infer the properties of the elements of those aggregates, epidemiologists warn of an 'ecological fallacy,' and even though ecologists may bristle at the term, the effect is real and avoidable.

For example, WNV infection rates in mosquitoes should be related to the bird community that fed the mosquito population. Investigations must acknowledge variation in vector feeding behaviour (host species preferences), vector and host transmission biology, and the influences of abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, rainfall) and habitat types upon disease dynamics (Randolph & Dobson 2012) . Measures of biodiversity should incorporate additional species that may interact with reservoir species, for example, carnivores that might influence rodent host population biology and thereby influence hantavirus or B. burgdorferi transmission dynamics (Ostfeld & Holt 2004) . A promising approach to understanding interactions between disease ecology and epidemiology is to focus on tractable manipulations such as removal of particular host or vector species (e.g. Tsao et al. 2004; Perkins et al. 2006; Suz an et al. 2009 ). Also, analyses must entertain and control for alternate hypotheses that affect both biodiversity and disease risk, such as rainfall gradients, urbanisation, vector abundance, human behaviour, latitude. Such study designs, incorporating ecologists, epidemiologists, medical entomologists and public health agencies may facilitate an understanding of exactly what metrics are required to understand the local disease risk, and the mechanisms that allow zoonotic disease to spill over into human cases.",

Our analyses suggest that the links between biodiversity and disease prevalence are variable and dependent on the disease system, local ecology and probably human social context. Broadly advocating for the preservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems to reduce disease risk is an oversimplification of disease ecology and epidemiology. If the disease dynamics are not well understood, conservation of endemic biodiversity could, in fact, increase human disease risk (e.g. if density of reservoirs or vectors increases), and may simultaneously remove economic and logistical resources from more effective control measures (Randolph & Dobson 2012) . Certainly, the links between measures of disease risk (e.g. infection rates in reservoir hosts or vectors) and actual human incidence (rates of infection in the local human populations) need to be better established. Furthermore, how and where humans are exposed has important consequences for the biodiversity-disease buffer hypothesis, that is are the scales at which biodiversity and disease risk are investigated actually relevant to human exposure to disease?",

However, our meta-analysis suggests that the dilution effect is neither general nor strong. The ecology of infectious disease is often too complicated to expect that there will be simple relationships between disease risk and biodiversity. A focus on the local ecology and interactions of important hosts and vectors is more likely to reveal insights into how to reduce disease risk and humans. ",
