            "text": "Due to changing climates, the \u2018new\u2019 modes of living by the people, and increased natural disasters, unprecedented outbreaks of emerging and reemerging diseases have been occurring since many years by now. Their outbreaks have been further critically important in the public and for veterinary health because of their immediate effects leading to disability, death and long-term illness of humans and animals. It\u2019s clearly a society issue and dealing with the wider public health, now on a global scale. Thus, with the emergence of suitable climates, vectors, and hosts, microspecies (ms) like viruses, rickettsia, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and fungi actually are the underlying causes of high morbidity and mortality of macrospecies (MS) like humans, animals, and plants in a wide geographic condition. That is why presence of ms can determine the survival value of the MS with reference to geography and time. The aim of this chapter is to explain a clear causal understanding of the diseases, their causal agents (e.g., ms), and the hosts (e.g., MS) in the context of Nepal, a well-known country in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region and a typical example of complex landscapes in terms of altitudinal gradients, climate, bio-diversity, watersheds and culture.",

            "text": "Nepal makes for an inherent part of the wider HKH region that comprises all of Bhutan and the mountainous parts of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan; it also reaches further than those nations. Physiographic and bioclimatic zones range from less than 500 m of terai to more than 5000 m of high Himalayan region (GoN/MoFSC 2014). Thus, the northern or Himalayan region of the country accounts for the 15% of the area. The central belts or middle hills occupy 68% of Nepal. The southern low-lying plain or terai region is susceptible to flooding following monsoon and occupies 17% of the country (Amatya 2016). In addition to this altitudinal landscape, there are a total of 118 different ecosystems with 112 forest ecosystems, 4 cultivation ecosystems, 1 water body ecosystem, and 1 glacier/snow/rock ecosystem (GoN/MoFSC 2014). This variety of ecosystem accompanied with the landscape differences are the underlying cause of existence of various floral and faunal diversities. For example, the flora comprises the tropical and subtropical rainforest, temperate broadleaved-deciduous or mixed forest, and temperate coniferous forest with high-altitude cold shrub or steppe and cold desert (Lamadrid and Kelman 2012). The country is a habitat for a total of 208 species of mammals (Jnawali et al. 2011), 879 species of birds (Shrestha 2000), 206 species of herpetofauna including 59 amphibian species (Shrestha 2001), 232 species of fish fauna (Shrestha 2008b), 138 species of molluscs (Budha et al. 2015), and 17 species of domestic animals including 5 bovidae, 7 Aves, 2 Equidae (not including mules), pig (Sus scrofa), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and elephant (Elephas maximus) (Wilson 1997). This sets the stage for zoonotic diseases and for a disease reservoir.",

It possesses complex socio-economic, religious, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and socio-health diversities. These diversities along with other factors like climate change, population dynamics, and land use changes and globalization directly or indirectly determine the health status of animals and humans alike. Among these factors, climate change primarily leads to a deterioration of water quality, degrades air quality with a high concentration of pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and airborne-particles, increases lower tropospheric and ground-level ozone levels, and finally follows systematic temperature increase, for example, 0.01\u20130.04 \u00b0C per annum enhances the spread of disease agents at higher elevations at which they did not occur before (Sarkar 2011).",

            "text": "When the ms enter into the body, they search for a suitable environment and multiply and initiate the disease depending on the immune system of MS. It is, therefore, important to determine early enough whether symptoms may appear or not at this stage. Finally, ms exit out of the body via urino-genital (e.g., HIV), respiratory (Mycobacterium), and digestive system (e.g., GI parasites). As a result, the ms is transmitted into environment containing reservoirs or into another MS directly, or into arthropod, annelid, molluskan, and mammalian vectors. In these contexts, reservoir is a natural habitat of ms that includes MS (e.g., all pathogens), arthropod like insects (e.g., Plasmodium, Leishmania), arachnids (Sarcoptes scabei), and mollusks (e.g., Schistosoma, Fasciola, Clonorchis), plant (e.g., Fasciola), soil (Coccidia, Ascaris, Clostridium tetani), or substance, or a combination of them in which an ms normally lives, grows, and adapts leading rapid multiplication in a fashion that it can be transmitted to a suitable host. This pattern of chain of infection involving a series of journey of ms from reservoirs to susceptible hosts through various modes of transmission produces the dynamics of disease transmission. In this context, the third member of epidemiologic triad or the environmental factors such as climate, temperature, humidity, micro-and macro-environment, topography, zoogeography, host specificity, light, salinity, pH (hydrogen ion concentration), percent gases, soil, water, food quality, and nutrients are important. These factors determine the successful invasion, establishment, and transmission of the ms leading outbreaks of the diseases and morbidity and mortality of the MS (Ghimire 2014; Yan et al. 2016; Si et al. 2010; Roberts and Wiedmann 2003; Keane 1997).",

Among these underlying factors, the role of ms is critical because they may induce immediate and rapid mass mortality of MS leading susceptibility to endangerment and extinction (Field et al. 2009; Fey et al. 2015; Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez and Revilla 2014; Smith et al. 2006; Pedersen et al. 2007; Adams et al. 2017). For example, mass elimination of Mongolian saigas by Peste des Petits Virus (PPRV) (Chimeddorj and Buuveibaatar 2017), of amphibian populations by Ranavirus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and Perkinsea (Fey et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2011; Duffus et al. 2015; Isidoro-Ayza et al. 2017; Kwon et al. 2017; Geng et al. 2011), and of humans and animals by TB, influenza, acute respiratory, and diarrheal pathogens has been already reported around the world (NRC 1993; Gates 2014; DoAH 2016b; DoHS 2017). In these contexts, although several causes might exist, extreme virulence, toxicity, and the pathogenicity of the pathogens actually govern the disease appearance and outbreaks. Thus, understanding the role of ms in causing many food- and water-borne, vector-borne, and zoonotic diseases would make sense in veterinary and public health. In this review, the contribution of ms to disease susceptibility, morbidity, and case fatality rate (CFR) data of cattle, yak, buffalo, goat, sheep, pig, birds, dog, and horses have been expressed based on the reports published by of the Government of Nepal (GoN) (DoAH 2016b).",

AIB not only causes a severe respiratory distress but also leads to renal and reproductive tract dysfunction resulting in the reduction of quality and quantity of the egg and meat production (Cavanagh 2007). The disease is predominant in many areas with large commercial poultry population including both layers and broilers of all ages with high mortality. Nepal is one of them in which several outbreaks have occurred resulting in a high morbidity and about 17.5% CFR (Cavanagh 2007; DoAH 2016b).",

The virus contains surface proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) and produces 16 H subtypes (H1\u2013H16) and 9 N subtypes (N1\u2013N9) in avian hosts. This virus is classified into the low pathogenic (LPAIV) or highly pathogenic (HPAIV) strains based on their lethality (Alexander 2000b). Although both strains are transmissible via feces, saliva, nasal secretions, the HPAIV strain causes 100% mortality, even within 48 h (CDC 2017). On the other hand, the pathogenicity of LPAIV can be enhanced by other infections or environment conditions (Alexander 2000b). The Influenza A virus has been isolated from more than 100 different species of wild aquatic birds that can act as reservoirs maintaining the viruses in nature (CDC 2017), however, reports of detection of other genera like Influenza B are from humans and seals (Osterhaus et al. 2000; Kato et al. 2015) and those of Influenza C are from humans, pigs, and dogs (Matsuzaki et al. 2002; Youzbashi et al. 1996).",

            "text": "It should be important to note that migratory birds spread the Influenza A viruses to the geographically unrelated regions. In the eastern part of the country, outbreaks of an H5N1 avian flu occurred in January 2009. Since then, several outbreaks led mass mortality of commercial and household chickens and ducks (WHO 2012). In addition, the GoN killed several thousands of chicken and eggs to prevent the viral spread (CIDRAP 2017; Gautam 2012). The strain, H5N1 serotype, has been evidenced to kill chicken and ducks in the high altitude area (OIE 2017b), whereas both H5N1 and H5N8 have killed several chicken, Asian Openbill (Anas tomus oscitans), and the Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) in the low altitude area (OIE 2017a) suggesting Nepal to be highly endemic region for HPAI despite Her geography. One study found H9N2 in the stool of a ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) in seven wetland migratory bird roosting areas (Karmacharya et al. 2015). This suggested that this strain leads to endemicity in poultry and may evolve into H7N9 to facilitate transmission into human (Liu et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2014). Only one case of death of a 21-year-old male following the H5N1 infection was reported on March 29, 2019 in Nepal (Shrestha 2019) suggesting that the virus rarely spreads from birds to humans and there is no proof of the viral spread from human to human till date. However, pandemic Influenza A by the H1N1 strain has become a critical problem of public health (Adhikari et al. 2011; Anonymous 2018). Avian influenza is also critical in this country because of the full of various migratory birds in and around the Kathmandu Valley, major rivers like Karnali, Gandaki, and Koshi river, and wildlife reserves at the lowland regions in Nepal, and from China, Mongolia, Korea, Siberian region of Russia, and central Asia in the winter seasons. This is because one of the birds, wild waterfowl, have been shown to act as the natural reservoirs of LPAI and transmitters of LPAIV along migratory routes in Asia, Africa, and the Americas (Webster et al. 1992; Munster et al. 2007; Cappelle et al. 2012; Spackman et al. 2005).",

The GoN has not been able to issue certification process to ensure the quality and disease free status of pigs and as a result, exports of pigs and pork to China, India, Bhutan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong have been very difficult indicating an existence of huge impact on Nepalese economy by the disease (PEAN 2016).",

Most importantly, the serotypes O (lineages O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 and O/MESA/Ind-2001d), Asia 1, A, and C have been isolated from Nepal (FAO/EuFMD 2020; OIE 2017c; Chhetri et al. 2010; Ferris et al. 1992; VEC 2016). FMD represents an endemic infection since the time immemorial because it is found in almost all parts of the Himalayan nation during the year (DoAH 2016a). Its outbreak has been reported in blackbucks (Antelope cervicapra) in the Blackbuck Conservation Area in the Western part of the country indicating the possibility of FMD transmission to other endangered fauna (Anonymous 2009). It is principally found in elephants and cloven-footed domestic animals including cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep, and pigs and wild species, however, indigenous and improved breeds of these animals are highly susceptible (DoAH 2016a; Shrestha and Upadhyaya 2016). Its epidemiology in cattle, buffaloes, goats, and pigs is similar, whereas in sheep and yak, it is different. This pattern of MS-wise ms epidemiology is eco-zonal because cattle, buffaloes and goats are domesticated in terai and hilly areas and in contrast, sheep and yak are reared mostly in the mountain region. Interestingly, it has been reported that about 54% of elephants following migration on foot from the low altitude to the Kathmandu valley got infection probably from water buffaloes on the way (Kitching et al. 1988).",

The disease is epizootic in nature and its sylvatic or enzootic cycle is maintained by wild carnivores such as the members of the canids, mustelids, viverrids, procyonids, and chiropterans living in forest zones, national parks, or wildlife reserves although each strain is maintained in these particular hosts (CFSPH 2009b). Besides, its nature is zoonotic because it can principally be transmitted to humans and animals by the bite of an infected animal that contains virus in saliva. Several outbreaks of rabies have been reported in the canines and bovines in Nepal with its high morbidity and 100% mortality of the livestock (DoAH 2016a, b). Data show that rabies kills about 100 livestock and 10\u2013100 men per annum being the highest risk in the southern terai plain particularly due to agricultural lands, wildlife areas, and the open border with India (Devleesschauwer et al. 2016). Rabies is gaining significance in travel medicine particularly because there are many reports of bites and scratches into both tourists and foreign residents by rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that live anthropogenically near temples in many parts including the Kathmandu Valley, one of the oldest cities of the Himalayan countries (Devleesschauwer et al. 2016; Pandey et al. 2002). Although around 50,000 people seek post-exposure rabies prophylaxis (DoHS 2019b), there is no proof of rabies transmission following monkey attacks to the local and foreign travelers in Nepal (Shlim et al. 1991; Gongal 1998).",

Mass vaccination to all bovids along the southern belt in the Indian border has been credited for the freedom from rinderpest within the country (Spinage 2003). It has been reported that the population of wild buffaloes in the Tsavo National Parks of Kenya declined by over 60% and the lesser kudus, the forest antelope by 90% in 1994\u20131995 following rinderpest infection indicating a huge economic loss in the wildlife (Rossiter 1996).",

TB in Nepal has been reported in the half of the Nepalese population among which 5000\u20137000 deaths and 44,000 new cases occurs per annum (NTP 2016). Data show that new and old cases of low altitude people are highly infected compared to those in the mountainous region, however, M. tuberculosis-borne human TB confirmation has been the highest in mountains compared with other landscapes (NTP 2016). This indicates that the possibility of bovine TB exists in the public health in the low altitude which may synchronize with respect to the numbers of cattle and buffalo population.

B. melitensis principally infects the reproductive tract of sheep and goats and causes ovine and caprine brucellosis characterized by abortion, retained placenta, and impaired fertility. B. ovis causes ovine epididymitis. B. abortus infects cattle and buffaloes and causes bovine brucellosis. B. suis causes swine brucellosis (Smith and Shorman 2019). All of these brucellosis are recorded in Nepal (Knox et al. 2000). The disease is transmitted vertically into the new babies via milk and reproductive tract discharges and blood transfusion and homo-and hetero-sexual activities (Burgess 1982). Interestingly, few cultural practices involving the handling of dung in the agricultural land and biogas plant, drinking of raw goat blood by the pregnant women, consumption of raw milk, liver, kidney, testis, and brain, and practicing of shepherding and animal husbandry in the closet space with high stock density and high stocking rate might be the underlying risk factors of endemicity of the brucellosis. Principally, the evidences of high prevalence rate (up to 32%) and morbidity in the livestock of Nepal comes from the seroprevalence study of the disease of several outbreaks in the Bos grunniens, and its breeds with local hill cattle (Bos indicus), cattle, pigs, goats, dogs, sheep, and domestic and wild buffaloes (Smith and Shorman 2019; DoAH 2016a; Shrestha 2008a). The low mortality might be associated with different factors like pathogenicity of the bacterium that depends on the species, size of inoculum, portal of entry, mode of transmission, and immune status of the MS. Brucellosis has been a massive global economic issue because of the loss of income due to abortion, milk and meat production, low fertility of the animal hosts, and huge cost on control and prevention programs including drug therapy and mass vaccination.",

Its outbreak is presumably associated with the lack of immunity, the heavy GI infestation, the periods of greatest pasture growth (Leite-Browning 2007). This is possible during summer months when mass grazing practice is culturally conducted during the availability of the new, better, and grainy diet.

Various species of Eimeria, for example, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. necatrix, E. tenella and E. brunetti have been reported in chicken that might get coccidiosis (Adhikari et al. 2008; Jayswal et al. 2014). Several outbreaks of coccidiosis with high morbidity and about 4% CFR have been reported in chicken in Nepal (DoAH 2015, 2016a, b). Interestingly, the presence of one or more species of Eimeria, Isospora, Cyclospora, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and Sarcocystis have been predominantly reported in the wild hosts like red panda, rabbit, Hodgson\u2019s Giant Flying Squirrel (Petaurista magnificus), deer, yak, and in the humans (DoAH 2015, 2016a; Lama et al. 2015; Bista et al. 2017; Koirala et al. 2016; Achhami et al. 2016; Byanju et al. 2011; Ghimire et al. 2005, 2007, 2010; Ghimire 2010, 2018; Ghimire and Mishra 2005). Among these coccidia, toxoplasmosis has been predominantly reported in humans and domestic animals like sheep and goats showing the possibility of infection with meat-eating habits and cat-rearing situations in the country (Subedi et al. 2018; Rai et al. 1996, 1999; Sah et al. 2017). Even, it was reported to be lower in the sheep of high altitude with arid climate compared to those of lower altitude with hot and humid climate suggesting the climate-guided infection of T. gondii (Subedi et al. 2018).",

DV is an icosahedral positive-sense ssRNA virus that falls in genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae. DV has 5 serotypes and among them, only 4 serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4) have been reported in Nepal (Malla et al. 2008; DoHS 2017) indicating a serious threat to public health. Although the DV was firstly detected in a Japanese volunteer after his return to his country in 2004 (Takasaki et al. 2008), its sporadic cases and outbreaks were detected after 2006. The country had massive outbreaks in several districts in 2010 especially in Chitwan and Rupandehi districts. In a 4-year periods from 2006 to 2010, the DF cases increased from 5 districts to 24 districts indicating the rapid expansion of the disease in a wide geography of the country (Pun et al. 2014). Similar epidemics in 2013 and 2016 occurred infecting several people of middle hill districts suggesting the shifting of DV from subtropical areas to temperate zones (Gupta et al. 2018). More than 2000 DF cases as well as few deaths have been recently reported from 28 districts including Rupandehi, Jhapa, Mahottari, and Sarlahi at low altitude and Palpa, Arghakhachi, Rolpa, Pyuthan, and others at high altitude (DoHS 2019a). The shifting data are evidenced by the presence of CHIKV and DV vectors like Aedes aegypti and A. albopitus and the climatic variables like rainfall, temperature, and relative humidity are critical factors in the distribution of these vectors from the lowlands (80 masl) up to highlands such as Dhunche, Rasuwa districts (2100 masl) (Dhimal et al. 2015). The rapid expansion of the landscapes of these vectors and the associated viral diseases might be due to the increasing movement of viremic people, and means of transportation especially from the lowlands and endemic neighboring country like India, presence of vectors, and favorable environments via climate change (Narain 2008; Dhimal et al. 2014b). Thus, in addition to several socio-economic determinants like awareness, educational and social status, the role of climate change and the subsequent spread, acclimatization, establishment, and breeding of mosquitoes is critical to establish and transmit the diseases in a wide landscape. This principle also applies to the transmission of Zika virus (ZV) which is an enveloped and icosahedral positive-sense ssRNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus within Flaviviridae family. This is because since most cases of Zika virus are asymptomatic, it is not wrong to hypothesize the ZV existence in Nepal although a seroepidemiologic study could be used to prove this question (Wiwanitkit 2016). Nepal, as a member of HKH region, possesses few favorable environments of ZV transmission like shifting of Aedes vectors in highlands, public movement to the risk areas, lack of immunity in the people, climate change, and others (Dhimal et al. 2018).",

Rickettsioses caused by Rickettsia species are endemically found (Murphy et al. 2011; Murdoch et al. 2004). Anaplasmosis, transmitted by tick and characterized by severe anemia, increased heart rate, and hemoglobinuria, is caused by a Gram- negative rickettsial agent called Anaplasma. It has been detected in ticks as well as cattle, buffaloes, and dogs in Nepal suggesting one of the crucial vector-borne pathogens (Bohara and Shrestha 2016; DoAH 2016a; Adhikari et al. 1997). Scrub typhus is an emerging disease caused by a Gram-negative obligate intracellular ricketts called Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted by the blood sucking larva (chigger) of mite. The disease possesses a zoonotic tetrad with chiggers, rodents, scrub forest, and mites which helps maintain a sylvatic cycle among the chiggers and rodents (Nayak 2016). Thus, agricultural workers, travelers in endemic areas, people who are usual contact with mice and mites in houses or camping, and any form of temporary shelter are the high risk groups. Postearthquake consequences like human migration, overcrowding, and unsanitary conditions could increase the linkage among vector, rickets, and human which might represent truths of Earthquake Nepal-2015 (Nayak 2016; Upadhyaya et al. 2016; Blacksell et al. 2007; Sedhain and Bhattarai 2017). Although a neglected disease, it has high morbidity and mortality in the Nepalese population. Another typhus called murine typhus is caused by Rickettsia typhii that is transmitted by the bite of fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) of rats. It is an endemic disease of Nepal where thousands of people get infected indicating a huge public health issues in the country (Zimmerman et al. 2008; Walter et al. 2012; Pradhan et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2015).",

Temperature, rainfall, and environment have been associated with the outbreaks.

The GoN has listed 18 districts as kala-azar endemic areas, however, new cases have been regularly reported in other districts (DoHS 2019a).

This issue is evidenced by identification of the resistivity of one or more antibiotic/s to Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas, Vibrio cholerae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Shigella spp., S. typhi, S. paratyphi A, Salmonella species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, in clinical, subclinical, veterinary, and environmental samples (Lamichhane et al. 2014; Chaudhary et al. 2017; Rijal et al. 2017; Bansal et al. 2015; Dhakal et al. 2007). Regarding antibiotic resistivity, the role of a fungus, Candida albicans is important (Photo 40.3). It is critical to note that Candida albicans and non-albicans groups are associated with the infections and are primarily present during immunosuppression. In this context, antibiotic resistivity might be dangerous because few antibiotics have been proved to be resisting by both albicans and non-albicans groups (Khadka et al. 2017) and patients can experience with fatal and chronic infections. The search of reliable antimicrobial surveillance data in animal health is particularly demanding, and prioritized because of the emergence of multi-drug resistance of mastitis, pyometra, colibacilosis, and tuberculosis. It has been shown that antibiotic resistivity is associated with the environmental density of the antibiotics spreading from focal points of drug distribution and the close community environment of antibiotic over- or mis-use (Walson et al. 2001). In a close community, sharing water sources for drinking, bathing, laundry, and crop irrigation is common, and the practice of open defecation not only enhances the frequency of antibiotic resistant genes, but also speeds up the presence of biocenose that comprises bacteria, parasites, viruses, fungi, and others in the aquaculture, raw fruits, and fresh vegetables, fish, meat, and other agricultural products (Walson et al. 2001; Rolain 2013). In addition, ethnically used common herbal medicines in the country act as antiseptic or disinfectant that may contribute to the selection and multiplication of drug-resistant bacteria (Shrestha and Dhillion 2003; Bhattarai 1997). In these contexts, several MS like arthropods, annelids, mollusks, and vertebrates including human and animals may act both as carriers and transmitters of antibiotic-resistant genes or biocenose all over the environment. This also suggests the possibility of the generation of drug-resistant genes in biocenose following the continuous feeding of several herbal plants by wild populations.",

Deaths following snake bites and dog bites are also reported. In these cases, 32 deaths followed by the bite of more than 35,000 dogs and other animals and 20 deaths followed by more than 5600 snake bite cases have recently been reported throughout the country (DoHS 2019b). Critically, a total of 21 poisonous snakes include pit viper, krait, cobra, coral, and Russel\u2019s viper that are predominant in 26 low altitude districts and their bite cases generate 10% mortality rates (DoHS 2019b). There are cases of cat and monkey bites although none of the deaths have been reported yet. Due to increase in people-wildlife conflicts, attacks by monkeys, jackals, bears, and other large mammals have been critical in the country and it is not included in this chapter here.",

In addition, for several drivers of endangerment, the role of ms stands at the top. Although viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases can lead to an endangerment process for a MS, the role of climate change and antibiotic resistivity and their consequences are critical. However, how these drivers play a role in the endangerment process have not been evaluated in situ. While lots of morbidity and mortality data are available for livestock, they are lacking in the context of wildlife. An integrated approach of research on human, wildlife, and livestock should be conducted so that we can collect many data related to the neglected diseases such as zoonotic diseases like brucellosis, reemerging diseases like many parasitic diseases, major killers like influenza, and vector-borne diseases like malaria, babesiasis, JE, and leishmaniasis. A coordinated control program including enhanced surveillance, isolation or rigorous precautions, early discharge, and alterations in antimicrobial usage can prevent the spread and emergence of drug resistance in the medical and veterinary offices (APUA 2008). In addition, search of effective, specific, and safe antigenic molecules to be used in vaccines and mass vaccination to prevent the future infections of ms into MS should be conducted.",
