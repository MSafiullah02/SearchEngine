The patient likely had worsening of his underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to the extensive smoking history. Nebulizer treatment was avoided, as the risk of infection transmission via droplet nuclei and aerosols increases during nebulizer treatments because of the potential to generate a high volume of respiratory aerosols that may be propelled over a longer distance than that involved in the natural dispersion pattern [11]. Furthermore, the larger aerosol particles (1-5 \u00b5m) may stimulate both the patients and bystanders to cough, thus increasing the risk of the disease spread.

However, when the patient went into ARDS, it became prudent to administer parenteral corticosteroids as treatment with parenteral steroids has shown to decrease the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 disease and ARDS [13]. The patient became gradually more hypoxic and eventually went into moderate-to-severe ARDS, requiring invasive ventilator support.",
