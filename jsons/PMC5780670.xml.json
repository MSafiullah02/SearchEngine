            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity worldwide; viruses are by far the most common causes of ARTIs, especially among young children.\n1\n In particular, seasonal influenza viruses (type A and B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the main etiological agents during the epidemic period (between October and April in the northern hemisphere).\n2\n, \n3\n RSV infection is usually much more frequently identified than influenza in children; indeed, about 77% of infants have had an RSV infection before 5 years of age. This virus is the main cause of bronchiolitis, which is one of the major reasons of hospitalization in children under 2 years of age.\n4\n However, recent data show the important clinical role of seasonal influenza in children. In fact, the rate of hospitalization for seasonal influenza is not <3\u00b76 per 10 000 child/year, and hospitalization can also regard previously healthy children and children older than 2 years.\n4\n, \n5\n The recent epidemiological scenario has been enlivened by the identification and emergence of several pathogens with an airborne transmission pathway such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), first isolated in 2001,\n6\n human bocavirus (hBoV), discovered in 2005,\n7\n and influenza virus 2009 A(H1N1), identified in 2009, and responsible for the first pandemic of the new millennium.\n8\n HMPV and hBoV are isolated in 3\u00b79\u201316% of children hospitalized for ARTIs. The first is associated with a large spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia,\n9\n, \n10\n and thus, it is considered to be one of the most important respiratory emerging viruses, while the second seems to have a marginal role as it causes mainly upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), when detected alone.\n11\n\n",
