            "text": "Toroviruses are enveloped viruses with a single stranded RNA genome, which belong to the Torovirinae subfamily from the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order (ICTV web site: www.ictvonline.org). Toroviruses are enteric viruses affecting calves (Woode et al., 1982, Brown et al., 1987), horses (Weiss et al., 1983), pigs (Scott et al., 1987) and humans (Beards et al., 1986), and probably other species of domestic animals (Weiss et al., 1984). The first torovirus identified was the equine torovirus, known as Berne virus or BEV (Weiss et al., 1983). It is the only torovirus that has been adapted to grow in tissue culture, and thus, is the most thoroughly studied at the molecular level, and the prototype member of the torovirus genus. Nonetheless, most of the available information about torovirus epidemiology has been obtained from bovine torovirus (BToV), since successful experimental infections of gnotobiotic calves can be readily performed, and this, in turn, has facilitated the development of diagnostic methods to detect antibodies in serum samples (Brown et al., 1987) and viral particles in faecal specimens (Koopmans et al., 1990). BToV was first isolated in United States (Woode et al., 1982), but it has been later found in other countries such as Canada (Duckmanton et al., 1998), Japan (Ito et al., 2007), South Korea (Park et al., 2007), Austria (Haschek et al., 2006), United Kingdom (Liebler et al., 1992), The Netherlands (Koopmans et al., 1989), Germany (Koopmans et al., 1989), Italy (Lavazza, 1989) and South Africa (Vorster and Gerdes, 1993). Moreover, the infectious cycle of BToV under natural field conditions was established by compiling information from different studies (Hoet and Saif, 2004). In contrast, little is known about the porcine torovirus (PToV) epidemiology, despite it has been detected in Canada (Durham et al., 1989), South Africa (Penrith and Gerdes, 1992), and in different European countries as United Kingdom (Scott et al., 1987), The Netherlands and Belgium (Kroneman et al., 1998), Italy (Lavazza et al., 1996, Smits et al., 2003), Hungary (Matiz et al., 2002) and, recently also in Spain (Pignatelli et al., 2009, Pignatelli et al., 2010). The results of these studies indicated a high prevalence of PToV in porcine herds as well as an extensive geographical distribution of the virus. However, little information about the characteristics of PToV spreading or about the dynamics of PToV infection in piglets is available.",

However, to date, there is little information available about PToV epidemiology. Probably, the impossibility of growing the virus in culture cells has precluded the development of diagnostic methods. Recently, it have been reported the development of an ELISA assay (Pignatelli et al., 2009) and a real-time RT-PCR method (Pignatelli et al., 2010) to detect either antibodies to PToV or viral RNA, respectively, in swine samples. Using these methods, it was possible to determine the presence of PToV in the Spanish porcine livestock. In the present work, the longitudinal monitoring of PToV infection was carried out in three Spanish farms. This work further confirmed the presence of PToV in Spanish swine herds, and allowed to determine its infection dynamics during the first 15 weeks of age.",

These results are in agreement with previous studies performed with a reduced number of animals from different Spanish farms (Pignatelli et al., 2009, Pignatelli et al., 2010). In addition, the present data about the occurrence of PToV shedding in faeces are similar to those observed in another longitudinal study performed in a small number of piglets from two farms in Central Europe (Kroneman et al., 1998). Similar virus infection dynamics in young animals have also been described for BToV (Duckmanton et al., 1998) and other enteric viruses such as rotavirus in Danish (Svensmark et al., 1989) and Italian (Martella et al., 2007) farms.

During the first week of life, when piglets remained with their sows, half of the piglets from farm A and some piglets from farms B and C shed PToV, indicating that those piglets had already been infected and, therefore, sows might be the viral source. As determined from the analyses by ELISA and neutralizing assays, most piglets (92%) from the three farms had received antibodies against PToV through maternal colostrum. No differences between IgG and neutralizing antibody levels were observed between piglets that shed or not the virus at first week of age. Differences were neither observed in the levels of antibodies in serum samples from sows. Hence, the results indicate that, especially in farm A, maternal antibody transfer probably provided a partial or null protection against virus infection in piglets. A potential explanation for the higher rate of infection in farm A could be that sows from this farm shed higher amounts of virus than those from other farms. Unfortunately, faecal samples from sows were not available and, thus, the virus loads in those animals could not be determined. Similar observations about newborn animal infection and virus spreading by adult animals have been previously reported for BToV (Koopmans et al., 1989) and rotaviruses (Snodgrass and Wells, 1978).",

Therefore, some contradictory results between neutralization and ELISA (or western-blot) tests were observed at such age.

That scenario seems to be critical for a quick virus spread since by week 7 most of the piglets from the three farms had become infected, as evidenced by the presence of virus in their faeces. Similar observations have been reported for BToV in calves from different European herds (Koopmans et al., 1989) and also from studies performed using sentinel calves (Koopmans et al., 1990). The dynamics of the IgG production against the PToV-N protein after weaning in different animals were categorized in four profiles. Profiles 1, 2 and 3 corresponded to animals in which a significant rise of the IgG response was observed at weeks 7, 11 and 15, respectively.

The real-time RT-PCR results reflected a new burst of virus infection at week 11 in all three studied farms. Interestingly, differences about the origin of the virus were observed. Piglets from farm A shed the same virus strain over the weeks, a finding that is in line with the observation that some piglets from farm A had not developed an immune response after the first contact with the virus at weeks 1 and 3. These animals could be persistently infected with PToV and shed virus intermittently for weeks. Re-infection of intestinal cells in the presence of circulating antibodies might also occur, as it has also been reported with BToV in calves, as well as with rotavirus (Koopmans et al., 1990, Parreno et al., 2004). These findings would indicate a lack of correlation between serum IgG and mucosal protection (Koopmans et al., 1990). In torovirus, impairment of mucosal immune response has been attributed to infection by these viruses of dome M cells (Pohlenz et al., 1984, Woode et al., 1984), which play an important role in local immunity.",

The incidence of PToV infection at each time point was higher in farm A than in the other farms. Interestingly, a higher percentage of animals that did not develop a significant immune response against the virus was also found in this farm. As mentioned before, a possible explanation for these results could be that sows from farm A might spread higher amounts of virus to their offspring than those from farms B and C. This would indicate that the degree of exposure to the virus during the first week of piglet's life would influence the development of the immune response against the virus. The infection in the presence of maternal antibodies may decrease or delay the development of an active immune response in piglets, as it seems to occur in animals showing an IgG profile of type 4.

Moreover, in a previous study it was found that piglets could be simultaneously infected by the two PToV strains (Pignatelli et al., 2010).
