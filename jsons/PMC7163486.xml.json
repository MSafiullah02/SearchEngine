NO will also react with O 2\u2013 in the medium and form peroxynitrite. And although most of the NO and O 2\u2013 produced by SIN\u20101 will immediately form peroxynitrite, some NO will be produced that might not react with O 2\u2013. Superoxide can also form hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can form hypochlorus acid and other oxidants. These reactive nitrogen intermediates and reactive oxygen intermediates can penetrate cellular membranes and react with pathogen targets. Thus, the effect we have observed might be even more polarized, as some of the effect of SNAP observed on viable free virions might be explained by the formation of small amounts of peroxynitrite and other nitrogen intermediates, and the minor antiviral effect of SIN\u20101 observed on hantavirus replication in vitro might partly be explained by the production of NO and other intermediates.",

The levels of nitrate/nitrite observed in patients indicate the accumulated levels of NO and/or peroxynitrite, but say little about the concentration of them at a certain time point. It is therefore not possible to state that the amount of NO and peroxynitrite formed in vitro by SNAP and SIN\u20101, respectively, and shown to be antiviral against hantaviruses, are physiologically relevant. However, the finding that iNOS\u2013/\u2013 suckling mice had higher levels of replicating virus than controls is in line with the finding that cytokine\u2010stimulated NO production inhibited hantavirus replication in Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, Davis and coworkers recently reported clearly elevated levels of nitrate/nitrite in HCPS patients 15, and Groeneveld and coworkers showed the same for HFRS patients 16.
