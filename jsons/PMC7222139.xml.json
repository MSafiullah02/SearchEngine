After 8 days of initiation of therapy, she presented with fatigue and palpitations. At the presentation, she underwent physical examination which showed tachycardia with mild abdominal tenderness. Subsequent laboratory findings showed uric acid of 11.2 mg/dL, potassium of 6.5 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL and serum calcium of 8.8 mg/dL. Thereafter, she underwent EKG which showed sinus tachycardia with peaked T waves. Her laboratory test results and other clinical findings were suspicious of tumour lysis syndrome. Therefore, she was admitted to the intensive care unit.",

On the day 2 of hospitalisation, she developed shortness of breath and hypoxia. Her respiratory rate was 26 bpm and oxygen saturation level reduced to 86% on room air. Thereafter, at follow-up, her chest X-ray showed a diffuse infiltrate in the lungs concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Subsequently, she was intubated and stabilized on mechanical ventilatory support. On the day 3 of hospitalisation, her laboratory findings were noted to be normal. However, she continued to require high ventilator support. Subsequently, she developed a sudden cardiac arrest. Thereafter, she died due to ARDS.",
