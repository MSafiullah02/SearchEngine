Human HLA-B sequences were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified from cDNA by use of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) or the Expand High Fidelity System (Roche Applied Science). To decrease background amplifications, 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (D-2650; Sigma-Aldrich) was included in all reactions. Amplification of exons 2 through 3 was accomplished using the primers F1 (5\u2032-CCGAACCGTCCTCCTGCTGCTC-3\u2032; end of exon 1) and R1 (5\u2032-GTGGTGGGTCACGTGTGTCTTTG-3\u2032; beginning of exon 4). Separate amplification of exon 2 was accomplished using primers F1 and R2 (5\u2032-CCCGCGGAGGAGGCGCCCGT-3\u2032; beginning of exon 3), and amplification of exon 3 with primers F2 (5\u2032-GCTACTACAACCAGAGCGAGGCC-3\u2032; end of exon 2) and R1 (amplicon lengths of 640, 329, and 386 bp, respectively) (figure 1). Thermocycling conditions for amplification were as follows: 30\u201335 rounds of denaturing at 94\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 15 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 s. PCR amplification generally required only the use of F1 and R1 primers to produce enough template DNA for direct sequencing; however, at times, the use of F1 and R2 and/or F2 and R1 primer combinations was needed to increase amplicon synthesis. Amplicons were separated from reaction components by electrophoresis in 1.3% agarose and ethidium bromide\u2014stained bands isolated using Qiagen Qiex II (with DNA eluted from binding matrix using nuclease-free water). Cycle sequencing of amplicons was performed using Prism BigDye chemistry (version 1; Applied Biosystems) in 20-\u00b5L reactions containing 100 ng of primer (4 separate reactions were performed using primers F1, R1, F2, and R2). Reactions were prepared in 0.2-mL thin-walled PCR tubes and were heated to 96\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 96\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 50\u00b0 for 5 s, and extension at 60\u00b0C for 4 min. Extension products were isolated by passing reactions through Centri-Sep columns (Princeton Separations) and thoroughly drying them in a speed vacuum. Products were analyzed on an automated sequencer (ABI 377 or ABI Prism 3100; Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Sequencher software (version 3.1.1; Gene Codes) was used to analyze chromatograph files in the generation of consensus HLA-B sequences and their exportation as ASCII files. HLA-B allele assignments were generated using the Assign software program (version 1.5.1) for sequence-based typing (developed by D. Sayer and J. Meier, Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia). A description of Assign, version 2.0, has been published elsewhere [12], and the most recent version is available from Conexio Genomics. HLA-B assignment was limited to the allele type (i.e., B*07 and not B*0713), which provided sample sizes large enough to perform statistical analyses.",

Predictive discriminant analysis (PDA) techniques [20] were used to predict survival among patients with Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) on the basis of the presence or absence of selected HLA-B alleles. The criterion variable was patient survival, with a patient either recovering from the EHF (n = 35) or dying as a result of the EHF (n = 42). Predictor variables were chosen froma set of 26HLAB alleles, alleles potentially associated with EHF survival. Fisher's exact test was used as the initial screening device to determine which of the 26 HLA-B alleles were associated with patient survival. An allele was considered for inclusion in the PDA model if its univariate association with patient survival resulted in a P value of \u2a7d.20. Once an initial set of predictor variables was selected from the univariate analyses, an all-possible subsets approach was used to select a set of HLA-B alleles that maximized classification accuracy.",

Survival is likely dependent on the rapid development of an effective CTL response that limits the level of virus replication before it can overwhelm the body, as is evidenced by increased numbers of activated (HLA-DR+) CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with nonfatal cases [3]. As our study suggests, the MHC class I composition appears to be an important factor in disease outcome, and the presence of certain HLA-B alleles can confer either a protective advantage or a disadvantage in patients infected with SEBOV. Our findings indicate that expression of the B*07 allele, which is highly associated with survival, confers a phenotype that efficiently drives T cell activation and CTL expansion early in the SEBOV infection, whereas alleles that are highly associated with fatalities (e.g., B*67 and B*15) contribute to an inefficient or unresponsive phenotype. One of the SEBOV-infected patients who survived had a B*07/B*15 profile (involving good and bad alleles), which suggests that, by itself, the B*07 allele may be sufficient to restrict SEBOV replication. With more data, one might be able to model the survival of patients with one good allele and one bad allele. However, in the present study, only 2 patients had such a profile, and, therefore, only univariate associations between allele type and patient survival were possible.",

It has also been reported that HLA-B-restricted epitopes exhibit a greater functional avidity (T cell receptor avidity for HLA-peptide complex) than do HLA-A-or HLA-C-restricted epitopes [36], which suggests a significant role for HLA-B alleles in acquired antiviral immunity. We believe that this is also the case for SEBOV infections.",

The classification functions (LCFdead and LCFAlive) generated from the PDA model could be used to gauge the risks to those providing medical assistance to patients with SEBOV infection (should they themselves become infected), and high-risk individuals might be assigned duties involving less contact with infected patients and infectious materials. Similarly, patients with SEBOV infection might be managed more appropriately if a fatal outcome is likely.
