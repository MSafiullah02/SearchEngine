They are enveloped, nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses [1] . The Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as Wuhan coronavirus, causes the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, or COVID-19. The initial cases of 2019-nCoV occurred in Wuahn, China in December 2019 [2] . Based on a recent epidemiologic study there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019 [3] . As of 3 February 2020, 17,238 laboratory-confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV have been reported including 361 deaths [4] . The disease has already spread to 19 countries outside China, with new cases continuing to emerge daily. Recently, Chen et al. reported nine cases of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV [5] . While coronavirus infection is a common and usually self-limiting infection, in a specific population like pregnant women, complications of the disease appear to be more relevant, and pregnant women are particularly susceptible to morbidity and mortality, especially in case of high pathogenicity CoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u00c0COV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\u00c0COV) [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 222, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 427, "end": 430, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 590, "end": 593, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 706, "end": 709, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 892, "end": 895, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1303, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Correspondence"}, {"text": "Prior cases of CoVs in pregnancy have been reported.

Moreover, three women (25 %) died during the pregnancy. Alfaraj et al. [8] reported in a literature review 11 cases of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\u00c0COV) during pregnancy.

All women presented with fever, one before delivery and two in postpartum. Authors found various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas. One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction. No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases. All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV [9] .
