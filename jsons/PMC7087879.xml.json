For the purposes of this article, we define the industrial food animal ecosystem as a distinct entity consisting of organisms (including humans, domesticated and wild animals, and microorganisms) interacting with each other and an anthropomorphically designed environment designed to maximize profit rather than biological sustainability. Understanding the complex dynamics that define the food animal ecosystem of the 21st century is central to mitigating risks of emerging zoonoses.",

The outbreak of Nipah virus in 1999 exemplifies the former mechanism, in which domesticated animals (pigs) served as a biological vector between the host species (wild fruit bats) and the human population (Field et al., 2007). The development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is a central example of the latter mechanism, in which the food animal environment influences the evolution of pathogens. The use of antimicrobial agents in industrial food animal production, particularly at nontherapeutic doses for growth promotion, provides constant pressure on bacterial pathogens to select for resistance (Gaze et al., 2008; Silbergeld et al., 2008).\n",

While individual countries have taken steps to contain outbreaks at the farm level and to reduce local dissemination of HPAI, the globalized nature of the food animal production industry and supply chain must be recognized for its role in augmenting rapid transmission of pathogens across long distances.",

In the USA, growth in wealth and population coincided with increased efficiencies in animal production and government subsidies to agriculture, contributing to changes in the price and availability of livestock-derived food products (Pollan, 2006). The industrialization of the industry has now spread to much of the world (World Bank, 2005), resulting in dramatic changes in the ecological and organizational landscape of food animal production from 1918 to the present (Silbergeld et al., 2008). Although beyond the scope of this article, the growing centralization of the food animal production industry also has ramifications for food security particularly in the developing world, where reduced access to markets and increased regulations limit small-holder animal production and availability of animal protein.",

Influenza A viruses are classified by subtypes on the basis of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens and their pathogenicity to chickens. Strains that cause severe disease and high levels of mortality are classified as highly pathogenic avian influenza while viruses causing milder disease in domesticated poultry are classified as low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI).",

Gilchrist et al. (2007) note the proximity of concentrated poultry and swine operations as a source of disease risk from influenza A viruses, although to date there have only been reports of avian influenza viruses in pigs, not swine influenza in poultry. Classical H1N1 swine influenza viruses are very similar to the virus implicated in the 1918 human influenza pandemic and circulate predominantly in the USA and Asia. H3N2 viruses of human origin have been isolated from pigs in Europe and the Americas shortly after their emergence in humans (Webby and Webster, 2001), and are now endemic in pigs in southern China (Peiris et al., 2001), where they cocirculate with H9N2 viruses with the potential of reassortment with H5N1. Evidence for the concurrent circulation of H1N2, H1N1, and H3N2 influenza A viruses in pigs has been reported from Spain (Maldonado et al., 2006). In the United States, outbreaks of respiratory disease in swine herds have been caused by influenza A viruses which arose from reassortment of human, swine, and avian viral genes (Zhou et al., 1999). Evidence for viral reassortment of avian, human, and swine influenzas within pigs has been published by Shieh et al. (2008), Zhou et al. (1999), and Ma et al. (2007).",

Measurement of aerosol emissions from a broiler operation revealed a million-fold elevated concentration of aerosolized invisible dust near a poultry barn fan as compared to outdoor air in a semi-rural area (Power, 2005). In a study of an LPAI outbreak (H5N2) in Japan in 2006, indirect transmission among groups of chickens was considered to involve dust or bioaerosol movement (Okamatsu et al., 2007).

Seven out of 10 flocks became colonized with Campylobacter by the time of slaughter, and two flocks were colonized by Campylobacter strains genetically indistinguishable from strains isolated from puddles outside of the facility prior to flock placement (Bull et al., 2006). Campylobacter strains with identical DNA fingerprints to those colonizing broilers have been measured in air up to 30 m downwind of broiler facilities housing colonized flocks (Lee et al., 2002).

Retrospective analysis of between-flock transmission in the 2003 outbreak in the Netherlands and two outbreaks in Italy in 2003\u20132004 estimated reproduction ratios (Rh, the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious flock) of 6.5 in the Netherlands, and 3.1 and 2.9 for two distinct regions in Italy, during the outbreak prior to the implementation of control measures (Stegeman et al., 2004; Capua and Marangon, 2007). This clearly indicates that standard bioexclusion and biocontainment measures in a number of the predominantly industrial flocks were insufficient to prevent disease spread, and that disease detection or reporting was delayed. For caged layers, for example, Capua and Alexander (2006) cite a flock incubation period of up to 18 days, which, in areas with intense between-farm traffic, provides sufficient time for extensive movement of the virus.",

A study in Italy found anti-H7 antibodies in 3.8% of serum samples from poultry workers during the 2003 LPAI H7N3 outbreak (Puzelli et al., 2005). A study of persons reporting influenza-like illness in the Netherlands, during the 2003 H7N7 outbreak in poultry there, documented highest levels of active H7 infection among poultry cullers (41.2%), followed by veterinarians (26.3%), and farmers and their family members (14.7%) (Koopmans et al., 2004). Among swine farmers, Myers et al. (2006), observed higher titers of H1N1 and H1N2 antibodies and greatly elevated risk of seropositivity to these two influenza A viruses (35.3 and 13.8 odds ratios, respectively), as compared to community referents.

For example, the risk posed by an infectious disease related to food animal production may be influenced by:Providing incentives and introducing regulations to promote adoption of practices that reduce the probability of initial outbreaks (e.g., bioexclusion measures);Introduction of incentives and standards that facilitate early detection, on-farm containment, and eradication;Establishing incentives and standards to reduce release from farms and other routes of exposure of others (e.g., biocontainment measures); andDeveloping strategies to mitigate disease impact, for example, through emergency or preventive vaccination in high-risk areas.\n",

Likewise, depopulation of entire premises in the event of selected pathogen entry into a poultry house does not offer an incentive for reporting or for major investments in within-farm biocontainment (let alone between-farm biocontainment). Furthermore, compensation for depopulation usually only covers (partial) costs to producers that are directly affected by the depopulation, rather than costs to farmers who may be the first to detect signals of HPAI infection. Compensation and infection control policies should be designed to coordinate human behavior and public health goals, rather than set them at odds. Greater consideration of the human behavioral consequences of control strategies, and in particular the participation of social scientists in their design, would be beneficial in facilitating early detection and control.",

Semi-vertical integration of production processes, where a large company supplies young stock and feed, while farmers provide animal housing and labor, has often not been accompanied by systematic spatial planning of the units in the system. Although spatial concentration is convenient from an organizational point of view, as illustrated in the case of the HPAI outbreaks in DPPAs, it has serious drawbacks for the control of epidemic diseases. In addition to economics, a consideration of disease control should play a role in siting of animal production facilities, and greater participation of local and central governments in these siting decisions may be valuable in this regard.",

In (A), poultry serve as a pass-through between the wild avian host and humans. Poultry are infected by wild avians, and the virus replicates within the poultry host without undergoing significant alterations. Infectious poultry, in turn, transmit the virus to human populations, notably poultry workers. Model (B) demonstrates another role poultry play in the avian influenza ecosystem: the locus of pathogen evolution and adaptation to new host species. While poultry remain a vehicle of transmission of infection between wild species and humans, the virus undergoes significant changes and adaptations during replication within the poultry host. These mutations may increase the virus\u2019s affinity for poultry hosts, and, in the presence of human poultry workers, may facilitate viral adaptation to humans.",
