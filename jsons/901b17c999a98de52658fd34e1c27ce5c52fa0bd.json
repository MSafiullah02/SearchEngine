Furthermore, their lever of nursing education ranges from junior college degree to graduate degree. The majority of nurses have a bachelor's degree. The average years of nursing in psychiatric hospitals are 14.5 years. They are equipped with extensive clinical experiences. The participants worked in a psychiatric hospital with more than 1200 inpatients during the COVID-19 outbreak located in Chengdu city, Sichuan Province, in the west of China.

When I saw those nurses working in the front line of anti epidemic in Wuhan on TV, I began to blame myself for not being a nurse in the respiratory department or ICU. \" Fourth, the role conflict between family and work. Traditional Chinese families usually live together with three generations. Adults are responsible for the care of elderly parents and young children (Liu et al., 2020) . During the outbreak, the daily care of the elderly parents, especially with various chronic diseases, become a major problem. In addition, due to the full suspension of school, nurses also needed to provide homework tutoring after work for their own children receiving online school education at home. Nurses were struggling with these responsibilities. Nurses were also worried about themselves to be carriers of new coronavirus, causing cross infection between patients and family members.",
