            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a progressive Arthus-type immune-mediated disease, predominantly of cats from multiple-cat households (Pedersen, 1995b, Foley et al., 1997). The disease develops after a mutant enteric coronavirus gains entry into the feline macrophage and the cat's innate immune system fails to contain and eliminate the intracellular infection. Infected macrophages disseminate systemically and trigger immunological processes resulting in microgranuloma formation, vasculitis, organ failure, and death (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980, Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998). Many details of this process are poorly understood, including the immunopathogenesis of the disease. The tremendous clinical variability in FIP has made investigating the immunopathology difficult.",

            "text": "Neurological FIP, which is clinically and pathologically more homogeneous than systemic FIP, is a good system for establishing baseline characteristics of immunopathogenesis (Foley and Leutenegger 2001). Neurological FIP occurs in about 1/3 of the cats with FIP (Fenner, 1991, Kline et al., 1994, Foley et al., 1998), and presents with weight loss, fever, ataxia, dementia, and other abnormal neurological signs (Kornegay, 1978, August, 1984, Kline et al., 1994, Foley et al., 1998). Neurological FIP consists of meningitis, ependymitis, periventriculitis, and choroiditis, sometimes leading to obstructive hydrocephalus(Slauson and Finn, 1972, Krum et al., 1975, Legendre and Whitenack, 1975, Kornegay, 1978, Tamke et al., 1988, Summers et al., 1995, Foley et al., 1998). Often there is little coronavirus present in FIP-affected brain tissue (Foley et al 1998), yet inflammatory cells are recruited to the brain and contribute to disease, in part, through secretion of cytokines. Little is known about cytokine secretion in FIP, although preliminary studies have described increases in IL-10 (Dean et al 1997), IL-6 and IL-1 (Goitsuka et al 1990), and IL-1\u03b1(Hasegawa and Hasegawa 1991), and reductions in IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 (Gunn-Moore et al 1998) in generalized FIP. No information is available regarding cytokine production in neurological FIP and how cytokines compare, in this tissue, with abdominal tissues of cats with generalized or effusive FIP. The purpose of this study was to compare cytokines in the brains of FIP-affected cats with that in the brains of control cats (well cats and cats with neuropathies not attributable tocoronavirus).",

Eleven cats had non-FIP neurological disease, and seven cats were healthy controls with pathologically normal brains.

A Wilcox signed rank test was used to compare clinical scores and Mann\u2013Whitney U-test to compare FECV titers. The t-tests were used to compare the means of transcription of coronavirus RNA, serum protein, and serum globulins in cats with neurological vs generalized FIP. Cytokine levels among groups were compared by single-factor ANOVA. Prior to this analysis, within-cat variance was assessed to ensure that it was appropriate to pool tissue for cytokine analysis. Three to four duplicate sections of the CNS of six cats, three with systemic FIP and three with neurological FIP, were separately extracted and evaluated for cytokine mRNA by PCR. Within-cat variance was compared with between-cat variance to determine whether it was valid to lump samples from within a cat. Results of the ANOVA indicated statistical significance for all cytokines except IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-\u03b1, indicating that levels of the other cytokines from multiple sections from a single cat were much more similar to each other than to sections from other cats. The P-values were 0.02 for IL-1\u03b2, 0.03 for IL-6, 0.01 for IFN-\u03b3, 0.007 for TNF-\u03b1, 0.05 for MIP-1\u03b1, and 0.002 for RANTES. Further analysis consisted of principal components analysis (PCA), in order to identify major contributory cytokines in the profiles. This method recharacterizes variables into several principal components (PC) that maximally account for variance in the variables. The loadings give the relative strengths and orientations of the variables to the first several important PCs. In other words, the first PC is an axis that goes through the centroid (of the data cloud) in such a way so as to minimize the average square distance of the points from the axis. The second PC also goes through the centroid, through the maximum variation in the data, but must be completely uncorrelated with PC1. Results of statistical tests were considered significant if the probability of obtaining the observed results by chance alone was \u22640.05.",

In neurological FIP, there are consistent increases in several cytokines, but importantly, far less variability in levels than in generalized FIP, making neurological FIP a valuable clinical model for studying the immunopathogenesis of FIP. The technique of using archived brain tissue for RT-PCR with TaqMan PCR proved sensitive and practical for a variety of cytokines. Because each assay was calibrated to an internal RNA GAPDH control for that sample, loss of signal strength due to formalin fixation, paraffin-embedding, or archiving duration could be controlled for. In fact, our laboratory has successfully amplified cytokines from cat tissues as old as 25 years in storage (C. Leutenegger, unpublished data).

This could reflect localization of coronavirus RNA or a primarily immune-mediated disease initiated by the presence of coronavirus but operating autonomously with undetectably low levels of virus. It is unlikely to have been due to antigen\u2013antibody binding because the virus would still be available for PCR. Mouse models of FIP help clarify the significance of ongoing immune-mediated processes in these diseases. In MHV-JHM in mice, CD4+and CD8+T-cells contribute to viral clearance, but B-cell products contribute to demyelination; thus SCID mice (which cannot eliminate virus or make antibodies) have very high viral load but no lesions in the face of low or undetectable antibodies (Houtman and Fleming 1996). Antibodies have been reported to exacerbate clinical FIP (Weiss and Scott, 1981, Vennema et al., 1990, Hohdatsu et al., 1991, Corapi et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1992).

A few studies have evaluated changes in cytokine levels directly attributable to age. Using a murine scald injury model, splenocyte production of both IL-4 and IL-10 increased with age, while there were no changes in IFN-\u03b3 or IL-12, and IL-2 production decreased (Plackett et al 2003); however, after injury, there was a decrease in all of the cytokines examined, regardless of age. In neonatal foals, there were no changes during the first 4 weeks of life in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, or TNF-\u03b1 (Boyd et al 2003). The cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b21, and IL-1\u03b1 increased significantly with age. These studies documented unpredictable changes in cytokine levels across species and disease models with age. In the present study, there were no significant differences among the groups with respect to age. In fact, the tendency (although not statistically significant) was for cats with neurological FIP to be a little older than cats with systemic FIP, and one major difference between these groups was that neurological FIP had lower IFN-\u03b3 levels, a cytokine reported not to decrease with age in Plackett et al (2003)and to increase with age in Boyd et al (2003). More importantly, in this study, cytokine variability in the systemic FIP group was very high, even though the variance in age was lower for this group than any other group except the well-cat control.",

MIP-1\u03b1, or macrophage inflammatory protein, is a chemokine in the conserved C\u2013C family of chemokines (Davatelis et al 1988). It is secreted by macrophages, neutrophils, inflammatory fibroblasts, astrocytes, and lymphocytes, and chemoattractant primarily not only for macrophages and monocytes but also for T-cells and eosinophils. It is pyrogenic and a potentiator of IFN-\u03b3 production. However, increases in IFN-\u03b3 were not detected in the present study. RANTES is a T-cell secreted chemokine that attracts memory T-cells, dendritic cells, NK cells, eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages.

Previously reported increases in IL-10 (Dean et al 1997) were not observed in the present study. The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to FIP is probably mixed: it may be important for early containment of FECV and FIPV but is not effective in late FIP. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes probably exacerbate lesion formation. In MHV, CD4+cells protect mice from encephalomyelitis and are important in viral clearance but CD4-knockout mice had less inflammation and demyelination than intact genotypes (Lane et al 2000). CD4+cells have been described as components of FIP granulomas (Paltrinieri et al 1998). The chronic inflammation and apparent failure to downregulate inflammation could be due to the absent (IL-12) or weak (IL-18) responses in cats with FIP. The low-grade IL-12 and IL-18 responses also help account for the lack of IFN-\u03b3 upregulation. In experimental FIP, apoptosis and T-cell depletion have been noted in the spleen and mesenteric nodes, apparently mediated by cytokines (Haagmans et al 1996). The apoptosis is mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and not only serves to reduce virus load (Shibata et al 1994) but also reduces inflammation (Schmied et al 1993). CD8+cells against coronaviral antigens contributed to chronic demyelination and exacerbated the lesions via direct damage in MHV (Perlman et al., 1987, Castro et al., 1994).",

This very important finding may be a key tounderstanding why some cats succumb to FIP, if they are incapable for producing adequate IFN-\u03b3 or fail to do so for whatever reason. IFN-\u03b3 has many possible effects, including direct anti-viral properties, inducing MHC class I expression, increasing superoxide dismutase, protecting against oxygen radicals, and increasing cytotoxicity of other cells. IFN-\u03b3 is important for clearance of MHV (Parra et al 1999), and IFN-\u03b3-knockout mice are particularly susceptible to granulomatous peritonitis if they are naturally infected with MHV (France et al 1999). Treatment with anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody increased mortality in mice with MHV-JHM, while therapy with IFN-\u03b3 reduced mortality and virus load (Smith et al 1991). IFN-\u03b3-knockout mice had higher viral loads (in liver) than mice with intact IFN-\u03b3 expression and more severe lesions, consisting largely of neutrophils (Kyuwa et al 1998). Results using IFN-\u03b3 in FIP in cats have not been highly successful but there have not been large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials (eg Mochizuki et al 1994). The three most likely reasons for poor success might be that (1) the more widely available product is a human recombinant IFN-\u03b3, with possibly different effects and the one that cats may make antibodies to; (2) the dysregulated cytokine pattern may vary enough among cats with FIP that a more targeted, cat-specific approach may be needed; and (3) it may be difficult (or impossible) to achieve sufficient levels of the cytokine in the appropriate tissue. For example, administration of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 to mice with MHV-JHM resulted in reduced virus levels in the liver, but not in the brain (Smith et al 1991).",

Because neurological FIP appears remarkably immunologically homogeneous (in contrast with systemic FIP), it seems possible that immune therapy might ultimately be designed for this syndrome, which could create a balance of cytokines that might allow a cat to eliminate virus without developing extensive immune-mediated lesions. The information presented in this paper contributes to the understanding of major aspects of the immune dysregulation that occurs in FIP. Future work obviously needs to contrast more generalized cytokine changes in cats with generalized FIP, and evaluate the ability to change cytokine levels in the CNS and also evaluate whether cytokine changes following experimental manipulation result in a better prognosis for cats with FIP.",
