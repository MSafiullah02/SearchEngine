About 1.4 millions of these deaths are children [1]. It is suggested that waterborne diseases have an economic cost associated of 1 billion dollars annually only in the United States [3]. Worldwide, an economic loss of nearly 12 billion US dollars per year is estimated [4]. Waterborne infections are caused by ingestion, airborne or contact with contaminated water by a variety of infectious agents which includes bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths [5]. About 780 million people do not have access to a purified water source, and an estimated 2.5 billion people lack access to improved sanitation worldwide [6]. It is estimated that 3.2% of deaths globally are attributable to unsafe water caused by poor sanitation and hygiene [7]. The United Nations identifies improving water quality as one of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and its target is to reduce the number of people without access to safe water by 50% in 2015 [8,9]. The World Health Organization [1,8] has reported that improving water quality can reduce the global disease burden by approximately 4%. Thus, there is an urgent need to undertake all possible efforts to reach this goal.",

            "text": "Even though waterborne outbreaks (WBDOs) have been declining dramatically since the 1900s, the global burden of infectious waterborne disease is still considerable. Moreover, the numbers of outbreaks underestimate the real incidence of waterborne diseases [5]. From 1920 to 2002, at least 1870 outbreaks were associated with drinking water. From 1991 to 2002, 207 WBDOs and 433,947 illnesses, associated with the protozoan agents Crytosporidium, Naegleria fowleri, Giardia, and the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae, Legionella, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni, were reported in the United States of America (USA) [10]. In the period of 1996 to 2006, 21 outbreaks and 507 cases of waterborne disease involving water not intended for dinking were reported. The etiologic agents were G. intestinales, Legionella spp., E. coli O157:H7 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that resulted in acute gastrointestinal illness, acute respiratory illness, hepatitis, dermatitis and several deaths [11]. In 2000, an outbreak in Walkerton, Ontario was linked to the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in the Great Lakes area which resulted in 2300 illness cases [12]. From 2001 to 2006, Legionella spp., was responsible for 24 drinking water outbreaks, 126 drinking water-related cases and 12 drinking water-related deaths [11]. Between 2007 and 2009, 134 recreational water-associated outbreaks (pools and interactive fountains) were reported by 38 States in USA and Puerto Rico. These caused at least 13,966 cases including 81 outbreaks of acute gastrointestinal illness (12,477 cases), 24 of dermatologic illnesses, and 17 were of acute respiratory illness. Sixty-four percent of the outbreaks were caused by parasites, 21% by bacteria and 4.8% by viruses. The leading etiologic pathogen was Cryptosporidium followed by the bacteria E. coli O157:H7, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas spp., and Legionella spp. [13]. In the Philippines, cholera is an endemic disease; it is estimated that 42,071 cases of cholera have occurred from 2008 to 2013 [14]. In 2010, several outbreaks in Haiti and countries devastated by an earthquake including Dominican Republic and Florida in USA were reported. These outbreaks were related to cholera caused by V. cholerae serogroup O1 and O139. The epidemic resulted in around 8534 deaths and 697,256 cholera cases [15,16]. In the same year, around 25 outbreaks associated with drinking water and other non-recreational water were reported in USA. Among the remaining, the leading etiologic agents were the bacteria Legionella spp. [13]. Furthermore, in 2011 in Germany, an enteroaggregative Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (strain O104:H4) was the causative agent of severe cases of acute diarrhea and bloody diarrhea due to the consumption of uncooked sprouts that were irrigated with contaminated water [17]. In 2012, 18 cases of cholera were reported by European Union (EU) countries. The United Kingdom reported 12 cases, France reported four cases, and Austria and Sweden all reported one case each. In the same year, 9591 cases of Cryptosporidium were reported in several countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium and Germany) largely due to C. parvum gp60 subtype IIaA15GR1. A total of 16,368 cases of giardiasis were reported by 23 EU and countries part of the European Economic Area (EEA) such as Bulgaria, Estonia, Sweden and Finland, in 2012. Additionally, 10 waterborne outbreaks were reported in EU during 2012 caused by E. coli O157:H7 [18].",

The infrastructure, chemical coat of pipes and the architecture of the systems could enhance or inhibit the growth of microorganisms even as microbial communities in drinking water systems leading to outbreaks. Breaks or leaks could lead to low pressure events and when repaired pathogens could enter into the systems [3,19]. These failures have been led to outbreaks caused by Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, E. coli O157:H7, Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Norovirus [19,20]. Water treatment deficiencies, such as inadequate or no filtration of surface water and inadequate or interrupted disinfection of groundwater, caused 14% of WBDOs during 2001 to 2002 [10,21]. The weather is another key factor that contributes to outbreaks, since it introduces contaminants into water sources by runoff from either a heavy rainfall or flooding. Moreover, changes in temperature can alter the dynamic of microbes in pipes since planktonic microorganisms may become trapped into biofilms, while pathogens on biofilm may be released in flowing water [3].",

The dual-labeled fluorescent probes such as TaqMan probe and the fluorescent dye SYBR green are the most used techniques for detecting pathogens [68]. qPCR approach has been used to quantify human pathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7 [69], and Campylobacter spp., [70].

However, most of these methods can only detect and quantify one pathogen in a single reaction [71].

DNA microarrays are arrays containing high density immobilized nucleic acids (genomic DNA, cDNA or oligonucleotides) in an ordered two-dimensional matrix that enables the simultaneous detection of hundreds of genes in a single assay via nucleic acid hybridization [77]. Microarrays are made up of glass slides or chips coated with specific oligonucleotide probes which are chemically synthesized short sequences (25 to 80 bp) [28,78]. Microarray technology allows the rapid detection of multiple genes of multiple organisms simultaneously in the sample due its capacity for screening large numbers of sequences [32], has high throughput capacity and is able to be automated. Therefore, large-scale and data-intensive experiments are performed in microarrays [4,28]. Microarrays have also the ability to detect antimicrobial resistance to different antibiotics, and the probes could be designed for detecting the host origin of contaminants, which represents another advantage for characterization of contamination in water. However, advanced molecular technologies such as microarrays could experience difficulties distinguishing between viable and non-viable cells, have a relatively high cost, and may have non-specific hybridization resulting in a lower specificity and low sensitivity [32].",

DNA microarray in a two-step PCR-DNA microarray assay that first amplifies the 16S or 18S rRNA gene, respectively, followed by hybridization of these products onto a low-density DNA microarray was developed to detect most of the common waterborne protozoan pathogens including C. parvum, G. intestinalis, Acanthamoeba spp., Entamoeba histolytica, and Naegleria spp. [48,49]. In 2002, Wilson and co-workers [46] were able to identify 18 pathogenic bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses by using species-specific primer sets to amplify multiple diagnostic regions unique to each individual pathogen in the microarray. Inoue and co-workers [80] studied the occurrence of 941 pathogenic bacterial species in groundwater and were able to distinguish between human and animal sources.",

Pyrosequencing technology provides a large number of sequences read in a single run [90]. In the pyrosequencing reaction, the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase are needed. The nucleotides are added to form the complementary strand of the single-stranded template, to which a sequencing primer is annealed. During the nucleotide incorporation, the pyrophosphate (PPi) is released. ATP sulfurylase converts the PPi into ATP and the ATP is then converted to visible light by luciferase and the produced light signal is detected [87,90]. The methodology includes a primary step of concentrating the water pathogens followed by a secondary concentration depending of the type of the pathogen. The third step involves DNA extraction (for bacteria and protozoa) and nuclease treatment (viral DNA/RNA extraction). Then, the DNA is amplified, the pyrosequencing is taking place and finally the analysis and bioinformatics can be performed [87,90].",

FISH is commonly used for the detection and identification of different microorganism in mixed populations such as in biofilms (Figure 2) and has been used to produce a quantitative description of the microbial community structure in activated sludge and wastewater [79,98], to study mechanisms of survival, infection at cellular level and detection of emerging pathogens from water, sewage and sludge [79]. One example is the two-color FISH assay, based on species-specific probes for C. parvum (Cpar 677 probe) and C. hominis (Chom253 probe), and has been shown to distinguish between the two species of concern to public health [33,99].",

Due to the fact that VBNC cells cannot be identified by culturable methods, the number of pathogens in this state could be underestimated and, if all bacteria in the sample are in VBNC state, the sample may be regarded as pathogen-free due to non-detection [105]. The conversion to the VBNC state is supposed to be a response to adverse environmental conditions [105,106,107]. Resuscitation of these species could be triggered by a variety of stimuli, such as rich medium, an increase in temperature, and the presence of host cells.

These methods are based on antibody-antigen interaction, whereby a particular antibody will bind to specific antigen which comprise the use of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies [28,63]. Immunological detection includes, for example, serum neutralization tests (SNT), immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). SNT test has been used for the serotyping of viruses and involves mixing a sample, extracted from a plaque assay, with antiserum and then assessing the decrease of infectivity by plaque assay [112]. Assays based on immunofluorescence and immunomagnetic separation (IMS) are used to detect protozoan parasites. The US Environment Protection Agent (EPA) has established method 1623.1 for the combined detection of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp., or method 1622 for Cryptosporidium spp., both of which use IMS followed by immunostaining and fluorescent microscopy [113,114]. Nevertheless, limitation such as low sensitivity, false negative results, cross-reactivity with closely related antigens and the need for a pre-enrichment in order to reduce the cell surface antigens, are present in these techniques [33].",

In these devices, one of the electrodes is immobilized with a recognition molecule. When analytes bind, a change in electrical properties occurs providing the sensor signal [115,116]. Mass-sensitive biosensors include quartz crystal microbalance biosensor, which uses a quartz crystal inserted in two electrodes.

The approach combines dose response information for the infectious agent with information on the distribution of exposures routes and is able to demonstrate if the health targets are met in a drinking water distribution system [123], which are suggested to be a health risk less than one infection per 10,000 individuals per year, or, a disease burden of 10\u22126 disability adjusted life year (DALY) per person per year [3].

It comprises data of illness, secondary transmission and immunity in population. Typically, the dose-response is derived from studies of exposure of human volunteers to different doses of the pathogen or is based on previous outbreaks [127,128,129]. Factors influencing the dose-response are the exposure route, exposure medium pathogen strain host endpoint and the data source. Two commonly models are the beta-Poisson model and the exponential model, described elsewhere [2,125,130]; (iv) Risk characterization is the integration of information from hazard identification, dose-response assessment, and exposure assessment to estimate the magnitude of health effects; (v) Risk management and communication is a decision-making process based in all previous steps in risk assessment [2,125,126,127,128].",

The advantage of probabilistic modeling is to distribute the uncertainties through the model [133]. The QMRA approach presents potential advantages and limitations of risk management options that could be evaluate by numerical stimulations to investigate their possible efficacy, and that risk below epidemiologically detectable levels may be estimated under specific circumstances [134]. However, the greatest limitation on QMRA is the lack of available data to carry out this assessment [134].",

Such investigations reinforce the need for preventive measures, such as those designed to prevent and take measures to reduce water contamination. A computational tool for quantitative microbial risk assessment, called QMRAspot, was developed for rapid and automatic undertaking of QMRA for drinking water. QMRAspot uses four index pathogens: Campylobacter, enterovirus, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia [143]. Also, a software infrastructure name FRAMEs (Framework for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems) have been created to assess the water health risk which allows describing the problem statement, integrating models and data-bases, and provides the infrastructure for performing sensitivity, variability and uncertain analyses [131].",
