The first check should be made during the initial telephone contact by asking about the most common symptoms: fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The second check should be made at the front desk. If there is any suspicion of acute coronavirus infection, the planned cardiology visit should be postponed, and the patient should be immediately referred to an outpatient coronavirus center for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing.",
