            "text": "This review will focus specifically on the role of defensins and the antimicrobial peptide LL\u201037 in human mucosal immunity. There have been excellent recent reviews that cover the structure, genomics, evolution, and mechanisms of action of these antimicrobial peptides [1, 2, 3, 4]. We refer the reader to these for more extensive discussion of these aspects. We will consider these topics as they relate to action of the antimicrobial peptides at specific mucosal sites. In general, defensins and LL\u201037 have two major functions in host defense: direct inhibition of pathogens and modulation of other innate and adaptive immune responses. The human defensins include hBDs, which are expressed widely in skin and mucosal epithelia, and six \u03b1\u2010defensins, which include HNPs 1\u20134 and epithelial HD5 and HD6. hBDs and HD5 and \u22126 are expressed predominantly by mucosal epithelial cells, where they contribute to initial host defense against infection and also to maintenance of epithelial integrity. HNPs are expressed predominantly by neutrophils and to a lesser extent, in other bone marrow\u2010derived cells that are resident in, or recruited to, inflamed or infected sites in the body. The \u03b1\u2010defensins are expressed constitutively and generally packaged in granules (azurophil granules of neutrophils for HNPs and small intestinal Paneth cell granules for HDs) and are released by degranulation. HDs are also released by epithelial cells in other mucosal sites (e.g., in the genitourinary tract). HNPs are generally processed to the mature peptide prior to release, whereas HDs must be cleaved by extracellular proteases to achieve the mature, active form. In general, hBDs are expressed by secretion from epithelial cells rather than by degranulation and are secreted in mature form on to the surface of, or lining fluid surrounding, these cells. We will consider hBDs 1\u20134 in this review, although at least two others have been described. hBD1 is widely expressed in a constitutive manner by epithelial cells, but expression is induced, to a small degree, by inflammatory stimuli in some epithelia. hBDs 2\u20134 are also widely expressed by epithelial cells, but their expression is inducible in most of these tissues in response to infectious or inflammatory stimuli.",

Like the defensins, hCAP18/LL\u201037 is a member of a large family of cationic antimicrobial peptides expressed in many species and has broad\u2010spectrum antimicrobial activity and many immunomodulatory effects. The cathelicidins contain a signal peptide, a cathelin\u2010like domain, and antimicrobial domain (LL\u201037). hCAP18/LL\u201037 is produced by neutrophils, macrophages, and various epithelial cells as well. The antimicrobial domain is released by cleavage by proteases, and this domain is termed LL\u201037. We will generally use the term LL\u201037 subsequently in this review.",

Humans express \u03b8\u2010defensin mRNA but lack the corresponding peptides, as the human \u03b8\u2010defensin gene contains a stop codon in the signal sequence that aborts translation. Retrocyclins are synthetic, humanized \u03b8\u2010defensin peptides, whose sequences are based on those found in human \u03b8\u2010defensin genes. The DEFTs also have broad\u2010spectrum antibacterial and antiviral activity and are relevant to this review because of their therapeutic potential and also, as it was shown recently that their expression can be rescued in human cervico\u2010vaginal epithelial cells by treatment with an aminoglycoside [8].",

The discussion of the respiratory tract will be most extensive, as some general themes and concepts will be laid out there. The mucosa within each system and even within different locales within a mucosal system (e.g., the nasal cavity, upper and lower respiratory tract) have different functions for the body and different needs in terms of host defense. Some sites are normally sterile, and others contain commensal bacteria. By necessity, we will not do full justice to the different domains within each mucosal system and the diversity of roles that defensins and LL\u201037 play within specific sites; however, we hope to convey the extraordinary detail and intricacy of the systems that have evolved to allow our mucosal surfaces to carry out their job of allowing exchange with the external environment, while protecting us from myriad pathogens and other potential injuries.

Children with CF are born with normal lung function but undergo steady deterioration marked by recurrent respiratory and bacterial viral infections and chronic lung infections with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia. BALF from CF patients has been shown to have reduced antibacterial activity, and this appears in part to be a result of high salt concentrations in the fluid and inhibition of defensin activity (which is salt\u2010sensitive) [14, 55]. Up\u2010regulation of hBD2 during infection may be impaired in CF [56]. Levels of hBDs and HNPs can be affected by gene copy numbers, which can be highly variable for genes encoding these proteins [57, 58]; however, no association was found between hBD copy numbers and progression of CF [59]. hBDs have been shown to be proteolytically degraded by cathepsins present in BALF of CF patients [60]. In addition, the LPS of B. cenocepacia renders it resistant to antimicrobial peptides [61]. Hence, there appear to be impaired activity, impaired production, and accelerated breakdown of hBDs in CF, which could in part account for reduced antibacterial activity.",

Furthermore, there are increased levels of HNPs and LL\u201037 in CF BALF [56, 63], associated with persistent inflammation and infection. These peptides could actually promote deleterious inflammation in several ways, including stimulating mucin [39] and LTB4 production [64] and interfering with activity of SP\u2010D [65]. Neutrophil proteases levels are elevated in concert with HNPs in CF and other inflammatory lung conditions (e.g., \u03b11\u2010antitrypsin deficiency) and act in a concerted manner to reduce SP\u2010D levels [65, 66] or stimulate LTB4 production [64]. Note that instillation of HNPs into mouse lung caused inflammation and deterioration of lung function [67]. These findings suggest that in some conditions, high levels of HNPs may be deleterious. In contrast, a recent study showed that HNPs released from dying and necrotic neutrophils dampen inflammation in vitro and in vivo, probably by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages while promoting macrophage phagocytosis [68].",

Elevated levels HNPs have been found in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [71] and ARDS [72], in these cases, correlating with the degree of lung inflammation or injury. Further studies obviously are needed to determine if the defensins are causative of inflammation or a response to other insults. The contributions of defensins or LL\u201037 to asthma have not been studied extensively, although subjects with asthma do have increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Of interest, hBD2 and LL\u201037 expression can be suppressed by Th2 cytokines, leading to reduced antimicrobial activity [73]. Corticosteroid treatment also reduces antimicrobial peptide production in calves [74].",

The extent to which these peptides act within phagocyte vacuoles or are released into the respiratory fluid has not been determined; however, high levels (e.g., up to 100 ug/ml) have been measured in blood during sepsis and in BALF of patients with bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis [78]. It is unclear how these defensins are processed or removed, although one mechanism of inhibition of HNPs in the lung involved ADP\u2010ribosylation on arginine residues [79, 80]. HNP activities are also inhibited by serum proteins. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved ways to evade killing by respiratory antimicrobial peptides, including modification of their LPS structure (e.g., B. cenocepacia [61, 81] and H.influenzae [82]) or secretion of other bacterial surface proteins (e.g., penicillin\u2010binding protein by Group B streptococcus [83]).",

Treatment of macrophages with TLR agonists increases vitamin D receptors and results in increased production of LL\u201037 and other vitamin D\u2010responsive genes.

SP\u2010D also plays important roles in defense against IAV [87, 88]. A potential adverse effect of severe respiratory IAV or SARS infection associated with extensive neutrophil influx is degradation of SP\u2010D through action of proteases and HNPs, and HNPs 1\u20133 bind strongly to SP\u2010D, generally reduce its antiviral activity, and can cause it to precipitate out of BALF [85]. We have shown recently that retrocyclins and hBDs do not interfere with antiviral activities of SP\u2010D but rather, have additive effects [42]. Defensins also have activity against a variety of other respiratory viruses, including RSV [23], adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus, and contribute to the respiratory epithelial cell response to rhinovirus [89].",

            "text": "Studies of human subjects with ileal Crohn's disease (CD) have revealed consistent evidence for a deficiency of HD5 and HD6 in disease pathogenesis [94, 97]. CD is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect the small bowel (especially the ileum) or colon leading to strictures, fistula formation, intestinal obstruction, and cancer. The main approaches to treatment are immune suppression or surgery; however, there is a longstanding observation that antibiotics can cause improvement. Changes in gut bacterial flora and adherence of bacteria to the small intestinal lining have been found in CD, leading to the hypothesis that some primary defect in antibacterial defense is present, leading to chronic inflammation. A major breakthrough in the field was the discovery of a link between frameshift mutations of NOD2/caspase recruitment domain 15 and a subset of patients with CD [98, 99]. NOD2 is highly expressed in Paneth cells and is a cytoplasmic receptor for a bacterial muramyl peptide (a cell\u2010wall component of many bacteria) that leads to NF\u2010\u03baB activation and production of \u03b1\u2010defensins. The NOD2 mutation is associated with marked deficiency of HD5 and \u22126 and is linked specifically to ileal CD and not colonic CD or ulcerative colitis [94, 100, 101, 102]. NOD2\u2212/\u2212 mice show decreases in a subset of cryptdins and increased susceptibility to Listeria infection [103].",

Despite this, deficiency in antibacterial activity in intestinal mucosal extracts and specifically in Paneth cell \u03b1\u2010defensins has been demonstrated in the majority of patients with ileal CD [94]. The deficiency of HD5 and \u22126 is specific, as other Paneth cell products, including lysozyme and sPLA2, are not affected. These findings led to a search for other explanations for Paneth cell \u03b1\u2010defensins in CD patients with wild\u2010type NOD2. Recent studies have demonstrated a deficiency of Wnt/Tcf\u20104 in ileal CD [101]. Wnt signaling is involved in differentiation and maturation of Paneth cells and regulates specifically expression of MMP7 and Paneth cell \u03b1\u2010defensins in mice, as demonstrated with Tcf\u20104\u2212/\u2212 mice [105]. Decreased Tcf\u20104 mRNA was found in ileal mucosa of ileal CD patients, and this decrease correlated with decreased HD5 expression [101]. There was no association of Tcf\u20104 expression with an inflammation score, IL\u20108 levels, or NOD2 mutations in these subjects. The Tcf\u20104 deficiency was again specific for ileal and not colonic CD. Heterozygous Tcf\u20104+/\u2212 mice showed decreased cryptdin\u20101 and \u20134, as well as decreased small intestinal killing of S. aureus and E. coli. More recently, the same group demonstrated a genetic association of one polymorphism in the Tcf\u20104 promoter region with ileal CD [106]. This genetic association was independent of NOD2 status. Hence, Tcf\u20104 alterations appear to provide another genetic basis for Paneth cell \u03b1\u2010defensin deficiency in ileal CD.",

Expression of hBD2 is inducible in colonic mucosa through activation of NOD2 and NF\u2010\u03baB. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, where hBD2 expression is elevated in areas of inflammation, expression is not elevated in colonic CD [108], and luminal secretions in colonic CD have reduced antimicrobial activity [102]. A similar pattern was found with colonic cathelicidin expression: increased in inflamed areas in ulcerative colitis but not increased in colonic CD [109]. Hence, colonic CD may also result from localized deficiencies in antimicrobial peptide expression and impaired epithelial antibacterial defense. CRAMP\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased adherence of pathogenic intestinal bacteria in the gut [51], supporting the concept that cathelicidins contribute to intestinal host defense.",

Over 50% of the human population is infected with H. pylori, and the majority is asymptomatic. It is therefore an important goal of research to determine which factors are responsible for colonization or disease induction by H. pylori. One important factor is variation between pathogenicity of different H. pylori strains; however, variations in innate defense against H. pylori may also contribute. H. pylori induces hBD mRNA and protein expression in vitro and in vivo in gastric epithelia, and hBD2 and hBD3 have strong bactericidal activity against H. pylori [110]; H. pylori LPS does not appear to be a strong stimulus for NF\u2010\u03baB activation in gastric epithelial cells, implying that TLR4 may not be a key pathway involved in response of these cells to the bacteria. Boughan et al. [111] have found that H. pylori stimulates hBD2 and hBD3 by distinct mechanisms in these cells. hBD2 was stimulated through NOD1, whereas hBD3 was up\u2010regulated through a NOD1\u2010independent, EGFR\u2010mediated pathway.",

It is tempting to speculate that impairments in early defensin\u2010mediated responses may allow for colonization and for ongoing inflammation similar to the findings in CD. The results of Boughan et al. [111] are also revealing about the complexity of regulation of different defensins. The authors speculate that hBD2 may be more involved in the early phase of host response to infection, whereas hBD3 induction may relate more to the later wound\u2010healing phase of the response, as EGFR (which is up\u2010regulated by H. pylori infection) is involved in wound healing.",

The importance of antimicrobial peptides to host defense in the intestine is highlighted by the ability of some important intestinal bacterial pathogens to counteract production or action of the peptides. As examples, cholera toxin and labile toxin of enteropathogenic E. coli reduce expression of hBD1 and LL\u201037 in intestinal epithelial cells [114], virulent Shigella flexneri release plasmid DNA to turn off expression of antimicrobial peptides by epithelial cells and monocytes [115], and Salmonella species can modify the structure of their LPS to reduce the ability of antimicrobial peptides to bind and kill them (see ref.

We showed that intrinsic antiviral activity of saliva against IAV is in part mediated by HNPs and by another antimicrobial peptide, histatin [117], although other inhibitors contribute as well. There are fairly high levels of HNPs in saliva of normal volunteers, presumably derived from neutrophils. Edentulous subjects have markedly reduced levels of HNPs in saliva as a result of absence of creviculae (sites of neutrophil ingress), and this may account for increased risk for oral infections in these subjects [118]. HIV is also inhibited by saliva, and HIV does not appear to be transmitted through oral contact. hBD2 and \u22123 can inhibit HIV at the concentrations found in normal saliva. Of interest, levels of hBD2 were found to be reduced in saliva of HIV\u2010positive subjects, possibly predisposing them to other types of infection [119].

Of interest, hBD3 not only has direct HIV inhibitory activity but also binds to and down\u2010regulates the HIV\u20101 coreceptor CXCR4 [126]. Cervico\u2010vaginal fluid of healthy subjects inhibits HSV (including protecting mice from lethal infection with HSV), whereas fluids from HIV\u2010positive subjects were less inhibitory [127]. The inhibition of HSV was correlated with levels of HNPs in the fluid.",

            "text": "There is an increased risk of HIV and HSV infection in the presence of concurrent sexually transmitted bacterial or viral infections or bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is characterized by changes in bacterial flora in the vagina with loss of the normal commensal, Lactobacillus, and acquisition of other bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis. Valore et al. [123] demonstrated that antimicrobial activity of vaginal fluids from patients with BV is reduced. BV fluids had lower concentrations of hBDs 1 and 2 and HNPs compared with normal controls or patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. The low levels of HNPs correlated with reduced neutrophil influx and IL\u20108. Hence, there appears to be a deficiency in defensins associated with BV; however, this was not an intrinsic defect, as in the case of CD, as the defensin levels rose after treatment of BV. The low levels of defensins may contribute to acquisition of HIV or HSV by the subjects. The reasons for low levels of defensins in BV may relate to failure of G. vaginalis to induce immune responses. For instance, G. vaginalis did not induce hBD2, IL\u20101, or IL\u20108 in vaginal epithelial cells, whereas these were all induced by Lactobacillus jensenii. This may relate to lack of LPS and low concentrations of peptidoglycan in the coat of G. vaginalis. BV, therefore, represents an example in which the commensal flora provoke a balanced innate immune response that limits introduction of other organisms, whereas a superinfecting organism does not induce this response. There are other examples of bacteria failing to induce defensin responses, allowing the bacteria to persist in mucosa. For instance, S. aureus strains from chronic nasal carriers were found not to induce hBD2 and \u22123 in nasal mucosa, and S. flexneri inhibits antimicrobial peptide expression in gut epithelia [115, 128]. Hence, acquired deficits in defensin\u2010mediated barriers can result from bacterial infection.",

            "text": "HD5 and \u22126 are induced in vaginal secretions and the male urethra in response to infection. As noted, cleavage of the precursor of HDs is necessary for them to acquire antimicrobial activity. A distinctive method of cleavage of HD5 was found in studies of urethral secretions of subjects with N. gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis infection [129], in which neutrophil proteases were shown to affect cleavage. HD5 and \u22126 are also produced by vaginal epithelial cells in response to N. gonorrhoeae infection [130]. Although HNPs, hBDs, and retrocyclins inhibit HIV, a surprising finding was that HD5 and \u22126 actually increased HIV infection of CD4 cells [130]. This effect was mediated by a direct interaction with the virus and occurred with purified peptides or supernatants of N. gonorrhoeae\u2010infected vaginal epithelial cells. The HIV\u2010enhancing effect occurred at HD concentrations of \u226510 \u03bcg/ml. Although levels of HDs in vaginal lavage are less than this, the lavage is probably diluted considerably, and local concentrations may be much higher. It will be interesting in the future to determine if subjects with NOD or Tcf2 mutations also have reduced HD levels at mucosal sites other than the intestine and whether this is associated with any change in disease susceptibility. Note that HNP levels are considerably higher in urethral or cervico\u2010vaginal secretions, and hence, their effect may predominate over effects of HDs. For instance, urethral levels of HNPs and HD5 were particularly elevated in N. gonorrhoeae infection (\u223c20 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively).",

Another paradoxical finding is that cervico\u2010vaginal secretions that do contain high levels of HNPs and LL\u201037 (which contribute to anti\u2010HIV activity of the fluid) have been associated in one study with increased risk of HIV transmission [131]. This was related to the fact that these samples came from subjects with sexually transmitted bacterial infections. In such cases, other factors promoting HIV transmission presumably outweigh the impact of the increased antimicrobial peptides. Of interest, increased hBD gene copy numbers have been associated with reduced risk of HIV infection in preliminary studies [132]. Further studies of this kind will be of interest.",

This decrease in antimicrobial peptide expression was independent of recent steroid use. Hyper\u2010IgE syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency in which subjects have atopy and recurrent staphyloccal skin and lung infections [148]. The condition has been found to relate to defects in Th17 cell differentiation, raising the question of why infections are confined principally to the lung and skin. A recent study demonstrated that this may relate to the fact that keratinocytes and bronchial epithelial cells (in contrast to other epithelia) require IL\u201017 and classic cytokines to generate chemokines and antimicrobial peptides [149].

Although mBD1 was also expressed in the cornea, silencing of mBD1 did not alter infection or inflammation. Tear fluid also contains SP\u2010D, which inhibits P. aeruginosa infection in mice [158, 159]. Hence, this is another site (like the respiratory tract) where SP\u2010D and defensins may interact.

Defensins have potential for therapy, given their broad\u2010spectrum antimicrobial and antiviral activity and the fact that they can be synthesized with minor modifications to enhance activity further. Direct application to sites such as the skin or cervico\u2010vaginal mucosa for treatment of wounds or infection is of interest, particularly in conditions where antimicrobial peptide generation is reduced. One concern for direct applications of defensins would be the possibility of inducing excessive inflammation, as occurred with instillation of HNPs into the lung [67]. Retrocyclins are of interest for HIV therapy, as they strongly inhibit viral replication [161]. We have found that retrocyclins have strong antiviral activity against IAV and unlike HNPs, do not interfere with the antiviral activity of SP\u2010D, despite binding to it [42]. Hence, retrocyclins may be a better candidate than HNPs for instillation in the respiratory tract. A recent study demonstrated reduced weight loss and mortality in mice treated with a retrocyclin by intranasal instillation 15 min before infection with a mouse\u2010adapted version of the SARS coronavirus [162]. Surprisingly, the protection was not the result of inhibition of viral replication. In this model, the retrocyclin did induce some level of inflammation in the lung on its own, although it reduced generation of some proinflammatory cytokines triggered by the virus. Hence, retrocyclins may exert beneficial effects through modulation of inflammatory responses in the lung. Another fascinating, recent finding is that retrocyclins can be produced in human cervico\u2010vaginal secretions in response to aminoglycoside treatment [8].",

Another approach would be to increase endogenous defensin generation through use of known regulatory stimuli. In a mouse model, administration of LTB4 increased defensin and cathelicidin generation and improved outcome of IAV infection [86]. Vascular endothelial growth factor promotes BD and SP\u2010D production in the lung, resulting in improved outcome of RSV infection [166].

This is most obvious for inflammatory bowel diseases but could account for a variety of other conditions such as gastric diseases induced by H. pylori and inflammatory diseases of the lung. It is of interest in this regard that BDs and LL\u201037 are imbedded in other physiological processes such as wound healing and angiogenesis, in addition to their roles in defense against infection. This is reminiscent of the roles of surfactant proteins A and D in the lung phospholipid metabolism as well as host defense. Another recurring theme is that pathogenic bacteria have evolved a variety of mechanisms to circumvent defensin\u2010mediated immunity to create invasive infections. Important subjects for future study will include how defensins interact with other components of innate defense, since clearly they do not act in isolation. Some preliminary studies have explored this question [65, 85, 117, 167, 168, 169, 170], but further studies are needed. Furthermore, it is currently hard to determine the relative importance of direct antimicrobial or antiviral effects of defensins or LL\u201037 as compared with their immunomodulatory effects in many instances; hence, this should be an important focus of future investigations.",
