This situation questions the capacity of the EU to deploy public health instruments to cope with pandemics. One such instrument, the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), seems to show a discreet involvement in this crisis, suggesting emerging isolationist behaviours of the member states.",

To put this into perspective, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have legal powers and cover a greater range of public health areas through bodies such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health or the National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC also has a much larger budget than the ECDC (approximately US$8 billion for 2020, 2 whereas the ECDC received \u20ac60 million 3 ) and staff (10 796 employees in 2018, 4 whereas the ECDC employed 271 people that year 5 ).",

            "text": "In January, 2020, the member states did not see the need for the EU to coordinate their responses, as they tended to underestimate the impact of the pandemic and the resources needed. However, the pandemic intensified within a very short period and became a large threat for the entire European population. Such a quick escalation became an obstacle to coordination at the EU level-a scenario where the ECDC could have been called to have a more active role, on behalf of the European Commission and the member states. The lack of coordination at the EU level became even more evident when national leaders sought to legitimise their decisions by giving voice to national experts, in the absence of multinational meta-analytical infrastructure or supranational coor dination mechanisms, or even coherent systems for sharing procedures and protocols. The European Commission advisory panel on COVID-19 was set up by the EU member states as late as March 16, 2020. 9 From a policy perspective, a European public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic was not possible because emergency structures had not been set up. Neither was it perceived to be a public good, not even when it spread across European countries. For instance, the creation of a strategic EU medical stockpile was approved by the Commission in March, 2019. 10 However, it was only implemented after WHO declared the outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, and several member states had difficulties in purchasing medical equipment. 11 We have found that only when key actors in the EU polity agree on a common response that is less politically costly than disagreement can European-wide public health mechanisms such as the ECDC adopt a more active role. However, for this situation to occur, institutions need enough time to frame coordinated responses and a political leadership capable of going beyond national responses and confronting such global challenges in a more effective way.",
