However, only four of the five sera examined in the other hospital exhibited higher ELISA titers than five negative controls at a dilution of 1:100 (Fig. 4b). It is possible that the fifth of these patients had an extremely low MERS\u2010CoV antibody titer. Thus, at patient serum dilutions of 1:200 and 1:300, the ELISA successfully distinguished sera of patients with MERS from healthy human serum, indicating that the recombinant MERS S protein produced in this study specifically binds MERS\u2010CoV\u2010derived antibodies in human samples and that the developed assay can be used clinically to diagnose MERS\u2010CoV infection.",

To select capture and detector antibodies, pairwise tests were performed with each MAb in an ELISA using 2.5 \u03bcg/mL detector and 1 \u03bcg/mL capture antibody (Fig. 5a). As shown in Figure 5b, c, two combinations were able to detect 100 ng of S protein: #16 S MAb as the capture antibody and #89 RBD MAb as the detector, and #9 RBD MAb as the capture antibody and #16D4 S MAb as the detector. However, only the #9/#16D4 combination, and not the #16/#89 combination, specifically bound to a serial dilution of S protein (Fig. 5d). Thus, the combination of the #16D4 MAb (induced by the S protein in the baculovirus system) as the detector antibody and the #9 MAb (induced by the RBD in the E. coli system) as the capture antibody was determined to be the optimal pairing for development of the sandwich ELISA.",

Fast and accurate diagnosis is therefore the most promising means of controlling MERS outbreaks. Traditionally, PRNT and/or microneutralization tests have been used as the gold standards for detecting MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibodies. However, these tests are labor\u2010intensive and time\u2010consuming and require high\u2010level biosafety facilities because they involve handling of live viruses 14, 24, 25. Therefore, more convenient methods are required. Recently, a cELISA in which a labeled MAb competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes was developed and compared with the PRNT assay; Pearson's correlation coefficients were reportedly 0.71\u20130.76 depending on the cELISA serum dilution 26. Although this correlation is positive, there were considerable variations at the same PRNT titers 26.",

We expressed the MERS\u2010CoV S protein and RBD in recombinant baculovirus and E. coli systems, respectively. The indirect ELISA involved coating with recombinant full\u2010length S protein, which specifically bound to antibodies in MERS patient sera, showing good linearity and reproducibility, as well as high precision and sensitivity. Therefore, the indirect ELISA developed in this study can be used clinically to detect MERS\u2010specific antibodies in patient sera. In addition, we used serial dilutions of S protein\u2010immunized rat sera to compare indirect ELISA titers with PRNT titers; human sera were not used because insufficient volumes of patient sera were available. However, we did not find a positive correlation between the two titers because of differences in the sensitivities of the two assays; specifically, a dilution of MERS\u2010CoV antibody of over 1280\u2010fold still showed a high titer in the indirect ELISA, whereas it was not detectable in the PRNT assay (data not shown). It should be noted that it is also possible that there were no neutralizing antibodies in the rat serum samples. Therefore, as stated in a previous report 26, further studies are necessary to develop a cELISA using MERS\u2010CoV S protein\u2010derived MAbs in order to determine the correlation between the cELISA and PRNT, the latter currently being used clinically to diagnose MERS\u2010CoV infection.",

Recent studies have shown that qRT\u2010PCR can also accurately detect the MERS\u2010CoV genome in a variety of biological samples, even when there are extremely small amounts of the virus. Moreover, the biological hazard levels required for the devices and facilities capable of performing sandwich ELISA and real\u2010time PCR are similar. Thus, sandwich ELISA offers no significant advantage over real\u2010time PCR in a clinical setting. However, the sandwich ELISA developed in this study can directly detect and quantify MERS\u2010CoV S protein. Given that most MERS\u2010CoV vaccine candidates target the S protein because of its promise as a vaccine target 27, 28, 29, the sandwich ELISA could be used for quality\u2010control testing, such as measuring the antigen content of vaccine candidates, rather than detecting MERS\u2010CoV in clinical settings.",
