Particularly, the prevalence of coronaviruses infection in patients with autoimmune diseases is lacking in previous literature. This issue raises several concerns regarding the utility to continue immunosuppressive agents in this cohort of patients during outbreak [6,7]. Recently, Monti et al. [8] reported that patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs did not seem to be at increased risk of life-threatening complications from SARS-CoV-2 compared with general population. Similarly, recent publications reported no cases of complicated SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia in inflammatory bowel diseases, even in those patients under immunosuppressive treatment [9,10].",

            "text": "Whilst these figures are reassuring, the scenario could be quite different with regard to patients suffering from systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc is a rare multifaceted autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammatory, vascular, and fibrotic processes resulting in skin fibrosis and multiple organ manifestations [11]. Lung involvement, i.e., interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension, is a common manifestation and develops in up to 75% of patients with SSc overall. To date, ILD represents the main cause of death in these patients [12]. Although at the moment the treatment of SSc is not well established, currently therapy of SSc patients focuses on immunosuppressant agents, particularly cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil. Furthermore some patients undergo conditioning immunosuppressive therapy before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) [12,13]. More recently, consistent data have been published on the potential effectiveness of rituximab and anti-interleukin (IL) 6 receptor blocker tocilizumab in the improvement/stabilization of SSc ILD [13]. Since the lung disease and immunosuppression are WHO-defined risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19, SSc patients could represent a peculiar subgroup of patients at increased risk of respiratory or life-threatening complications from SARS-CoV-2 compared with other autoimmune diseases. Very recently, Mihai et al. reported the observation of a SSc patient who developed a mild form of COVID-19, even in the presence of ILD treated with tocilizumab and type 2 diabetes mellitus [14].",

Different studies have shown that high circulatory levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines correlate with disease severity and poor prognosis during SARS-CoV2 infection [15]. Inflammation occurs to restore the homeostasis after viral infection and could be harmful if excessive. In this respect, Xu et al. [16] found an overactivation of T cells, manifested by increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, in the peripheral blood of a patient suffering from a severe and lethal form of COVID-19. The authors suggested that the important immune response could account for, at least in part, the severe lung immune injury in COVID-19 patients. Likewise, lymphopenia has been suggested as the result of lung sequestration of hyperactivated T-cells. In other words, inflammatory response and overaction of both T cells immune response in viral pneumonia could be a double-edged sword.",

            "text": "Although immunosuppressed SSc patients, particularly those with ILD, could be potentially more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection with severe clinical manifestations, the anti-inflammatory effects of immunosuppression could decrease the clinical expression of disease. Besides specific anti-IL6 effects mediated by tocilizumab, both cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of patients with progressive SSc-ILD, act as regulator of proliferation, survival and maturation of T-cells. Furthermore, MMF inhibits interleukin \u221217 (IL-17) production with a specific inhibition on Th17 cells [13]. Then, we can speculate that suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T-cell activities by steroids and other immunosuppressive agents might be protective, even in SSc patients. Broadly speaking, there is some evidence that the use of anti-inflammatory agents, and namely of corticosteroids, may induce some improvement in the acute phase of this and other viral infections [17].",
