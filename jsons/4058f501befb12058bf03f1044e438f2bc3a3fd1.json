The fi rst part of the chapter describes the changes in institutional structures since the 1990s that have had a fundamental impact on GHG. These structural changes have occurred as the discourse on trans-boundary health has broadened and engaged more public, private and voluntary sector actors in the debate. This has brought greater recognition of the need to mobilize a range of fi nancial and other resources and to adopt a more fl exible approach to problem solving. But the proliferation of public and private actors has also brought greater complexity that could inhibit the effective application of these resources and solutions. The second part of the chapter discusses ways of improving the coordination, accountability and legitimacy of GHG while preserving the engagement of non-state actors and the ability to respond fl exibly to global health challenges. In particular it explores the concept of nodal governance and its implications for the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the new dynamics of GHG.",

Since the mid-1990s the number of public-private partnerships ( Global Health Partnerships ) established to deal with speci fi c international health problems has grown rapidly. New actors became increasingly important in fi nancing global health activities including organizations such as the Global Fund. These new actors often developed structures and processes which were signi fi cantly different from classical intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) due to their highly focussed results oriented approach to single issues. In addition, one of the fi ercest con fl icts in global health, concerning the TRIPS agreement and access to medicines, unfolded with WHO playing only a marginal role.

It extends far beyond the economic realm to political, cultural, environmental, and security issues and implies an increasing transnational interconnectivity of people and communities, leading to a growing density of transnational social relations and the creation of common identities based on characteristics other than nationality-for example among people in civil society networks fi ghting for justice in global health.

            "text": "1. The trends towards globalization and economic privatization supported, for example, by the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), have reduced the independent capacity of states and IGOs to fi ght global diseases. As an alternative, GHPs have been proposed and founded to integrate a number of different actors in different combinations as required by the speci fi c tasks and the social and political environments. Flexible forms of cooperation became possible which combine the speci fi c needs identi fi ed by governments, IGOs or Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) with the scienti fi c and technological capacities and economic interests of private corporations and the fi nancial resources of donor countries, public funds or private foundations. During recent years, GHPs made important contributions to research on neglected diseases, to fi nance health activities in fi elds like HIV/AIDS and immunization and to improve access to medicines in poor regions (see \" Global Health Governance: New Challenges and New Constellations of Actors \" section on GHG actors). 2. The zero-growth strategy imposed on the budget of many UN organizations by the USA (but also supported by other high-income countries)-basically an expression of hegemonic con fl icts-signi fi cantly reduced the governance capacities of WHO: The so-called United Nations Reform Act (Helms-Biden Act, a 1999 US law) set a number of conditions for the reform of the UN system before the USA would even release its total amount of arrears in payment to the UN. The principle of zero nominal growth forced WHO to raise extra-budgetary resources which are mostly ear-marked for speci fi c projects and reduce the budgetary autonomy of the organization. Nevertheless, since the end of the 1990s US contributions to global health experienced unprecedented growth. The US strongly supported the G8 initiative to create a fund to fi nance the global fi ght against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria-provided the fund would not be managed by a UN organization. Thus, an independent fund was established, based on the PPP model (state governments, representatives of private enterprise and civil society organizations as decision makers; IGOs like WHO and the World Bank included only as non-voting members of the Executive Council). Furthermore, the US government created bilateral channels to make important contributions to global health, in 2003 PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief committed $15 billion for 5 years to the fi ght against HIV/AIDS; and $63 billion over 6 years to the 2010 Global Health Initiative \"to improve health outcomes\". In addition, contributions to global health by US private foundations (in particular, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) increased rapidly and since 2006 more or less equal the level of the WHO regular budget. 3. The high prices of anti-retroviral medicines, made possible by the internationalization of intellectual property rights in the TRIPS agreement, turned out to be a major barrier to realizing the human right of universal access to essential medicines. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), emphasized in its General Comment No. 14 (2000) that the right to \"the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\" formulated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (article 12.1) obliges member states to make available those drugs that are indispensable (as stipulated in the WHO list of essential drugs).",

There were also a large number of fi nancing initiatives (such as the GFATM, internationally operating foundations, and various NGO and church initiatives), as even with reduced prices, many poor countries need additional funding to fi nance AIDS treatment (Hein and Moon 2013 ) . These concrete processes made it possible to signi fi cantly expand access to ARV therapy for people living with HIV/AIDS and to expand the \"access norm\" to include medicines beyond ARV drugs (e.g., for heart disease & cancer).",

The interconnectedness of different organizations is by far too great to be displayed here in a meaningful way. Though there can be hardly any doubt that the number and intensity of links has grown considerably since earlier decades, a large number of inter-organizational relationships already existed in the 1950s and 1960s. What can be assumed as a qualitatively new phenomenon-in correspondence with much of the globalization literature and many accounts from GHG processes-is the high volatility of organizational patterns and institutional change and the fl exible reaction of Global Health actors to new challenges. Regrettably there are few systematic analyses of the dynamics of these networks in GHG. David Fidler characterized the GHG system as a form of \" open-source anarchy \", which is broadening and deepening the normative basis for global health action (2007: 9f.). \"Anybody can access, use, modify and improve\" (2007: 9f.) similar to open-source software. This means that the interactive space of relations between national societies is no longer dominated by inter-state relations. Transnational relations are not squeezed into diplomatic rules and traditional means of exerting pressure on other states by the application of power politics or through the complicated mechanisms of international organizations. Actors can use their speci fi c strengths to reach their goals ( fi nancial and expert resources, discourses and using them to mobilize support, including in fl uence on the process of international law-making). Transnational networks between health-oriented actors have been formed that focus on speci fi c issues (like access to medicines, neglected diseases, and tobacco control) constituting a complex web of global social relations related to the issue of global health. Jean-Michel Severino and Olivier Ray ( 2010 ) discuss similar changes in the fi eld of development aid (which is in part linked to GHG): the surge of an \"institutional jungle\" and a tendency towards the privatization of international cooperation. They propose the term \"hypercollective action\" to characterize this \"new mode of production of global policies\" (Severino and Ray 2010 :11). They acknowledge not only the mobilizing and creative dimension of this mode but also the \"considerable costs in terms of ef fi ciency, time, coherence and \u2026 credibility\" (Severino and Ray 2010 :12) . This leads straight to the points made by the critics of the advocates for effective selforganization through an \"open-source anarchy\":",

Donor countries agreed to coordinate and harmonize their aid in order to support their recipient country partners' national development strategies. These development strategies will re fl ect national needs and priorities while recognizing internationally agreed concepts of good governance. In preparation for the Accra High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (a 2008 follow-up meeting to the Paris conference in Accra, Ghana), the WHO, the World Bank and OECD proposed to use the health sector to track progress on the Paris Declaration: \"Aid effectiveness is particularly challenging in health. As with other sectors, dif fi culties are the result of inef fi ciencies in the global aid architecture and of poor country policies; however, problems in health are exacerbated by the inherent complexities of the sector itself\" ( http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/14/37/42254322.pdf ). Global Health is affected by the Paris-Accra-Agenda whenever country level coordination is at issue. UNAIDS promoted the \"Three Ones\" (2004), aimed at establishing: one agreed HIV/AIDS Action Framework for coordinating the work of all partners; one National AIDS Coordinating Authority and one agreed country-level Monitoring and Evaluation System (World Bank and WHO 2006 , p. 15 ). The High Level Forum (HLF) on the Health MDGs (World Bank and WHO 2006) held three meetings in 2004 and 2005. \"Scaling up aid for health\" was the HLF's main target, which called for a better coordination between GHPs, the improvement of health funding and concrete strategies to support the development of health systems in poor countries. The lack alignment of HIV/AIDS funding with government priorities, the lack of long-term support and the volatility of funding was criticized.",

Informal and formal networking in Geneva and at other regular global health events plays an important role in creating fl exible links between global health actors. The concept of interfaces between different networks can be used to analyze the \"power map\" of a governance system and the key characteristics of effective governance nodes. The interactions taking place may reshape the goals, perceptions, interests, and relationships of the various actors (Long 1989 , pp. 1-2) .",

On the other hand, the WHA, itself provides a decision-making process at the level of a legitimate international body, allowing nations, which are not powerfully represented in nodal governance processes, to express themselves and participate in legitimate decision making. Linking these levels of nodal governance-providing both the political space for informal negotiation and formal-legal decision-making and managing their interface-is a central task for achieving successful overall coordination in GHG (Kickbusch et al. 2010 ) .",

WHO was entrusted with the task of \"establishing and maintaining effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate\" (Constitution of the WHO, Art. 2b) (see Chap. 9 for more details). However, as an IGOs , WHO decision-making (aside from technical matters) has mostly been subject to coalition and bloc building processes among nations as well as to periodic attempts to curtail the autonomy of the organization by powerful states-at times coming close to paralysis (Kickbusch et al. 2010 ) . Gostin ( 2007 ) has proposed that the WHO take full advantage of its treatymaking capabilities and establish a Framework Convention on Global Health that ties all major stakeholders (states as well as non-state actors) to the aims of building capacity, setting priorities, coordinating activities, and monitoring progress (see also: Global Health Governance 2010 ) . A second proposal, which has recently gained considerable political attention, builds on the importance of the WHA and recommends that a Committee C of the World Health Assembly be established that-in addition to member state representatives-would include the active participation of international agencies, philanthropic organizations, multinational health initiatives, and representatives from major civil society groups, particularly those who legitimately represent the most vulnerable populations (Kickbusch et al. 2010 ) .",

The Committee would then pass resolutions and would be held to rules of procedure and implementation that respects the mutual sovereignty of all parties. As the only legitimate supranational authority on health issues, the WHO is the appropriate vessel for such a central coordination mechanism that would bring all prominent global health actors to the table for harmonized agenda-setting and decision making. Thus, the Committee C proposal can be seen as creating a link or interface between the nodal governance processes in each sphere of action and the legitimate constitutional position of WHO within a system of sovereign nations. This would greatly improve the chances of achieving productive coordination and the harmonization of con fl icting strategies by avoiding or mitigating the clash between power blocs and national coalitions with fi xed positions.",

Forms of nodal governance have great potential to transform the institutional architecture. The WHO, vested with the authority to create binding regulations and treaties among member states, could strengthen its role in GHG by linking formal decisionmaking procedures with processes of nodal governance , drawing the many networks of non-governmental organizations that form around speci fi c issues to engage them in global health diplomacy with all relevant actors and publics to develop a wider governance for global health .",
