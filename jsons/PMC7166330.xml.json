Suggested Kawasaki disease pathogens include Staphylococcus [Hall et al., 1999], Streptococcus [Shinomiya et al., 1987; Kikuta et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1995], adenovirus [Embil et al., 1985], human herpesvirus 6 [Okano et al., 1989], Epstein\u2013Barr virus [Kikuta et al., 1992], parvovirus B19 [Holm et al., 1995], human lymphotropic virus [Okano, 1999], and human bocavirus [Catalano\u2010Pons et al., 2007]; however, none of these pathogens have been confirmed to cause Kawasaki disease. Recent reports have suggested that heat shock proteins and superantigens produced by bacteria are associated with the development of Kawasaki disease [Matsubara and Fukaya, 2007; Nagata et al., 2009]. However, Rowley et al. [2005] reported that synthetic Kawasaki disease antibodies detected intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which were consistent with aggregates of viral proteins and nucleic acids. They also reported that the inclusion bodies seen in Kawasaki disease lesions did not have the substructure characteristic of bacterial inclusion bodies. Instead, RNA, not DNA, was present in the inclusion bodies, suggesting that an RNA virus contributes to the development of Kawasaki disease [Rowley et al., 2008; Rowley, 2011].",

Several HCoVs have been identified as causative agents of the human common cold, including HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43 (OC43), HCoV\u2010HKU1 [Woo et al., 2005], and HCoV\u2010NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004]. In 2005, it was reported that a new strain, HCoV\u2010NL63 [Esper et al., 2005b], was possibly associated with Kawasaki disease as parts of the spike (S) and replicase genes were detected in 8 of 11 (72.7%) respiratory specimens from patients with Kawasaki disease, as compared to 1 of 22 (4.5%) specimens from age\u2010 and region\u2010matched controls [Esper et al., 2005a]. However, many subsequent reports failed to confirm the relationship between Kawasaki disease and HCoV\u2010NL63. For example, Dominguez et al. [2006] tried to detect HCOV\u2010NL63 genes by RT\u2010PCR from nasopharyngeal\u2010wash samples, and detected it in 2 of 26 (7.7%) patients with Kawasaki disease and 4 of 52 (7.7%) matched controls. In addition, Shimizu et al. [2005] detected HCoV\u2010NL63 genes in only 1 of 48 (2%) patients with Kawasaki disease. Additionally, other reports failed to show a relationship between HCoV\u2010NL63 and Kawasaki disease [Belay et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2009].",

Dijkman et al. [2008] reported that 75% and 65% of 2.5\u2010 to 3.5\u2010year\u2010old children were HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010 and HCoV\u2010229E\u2010seropositive, respectively, and that most of the children had seroconverted to HCoVs by the age of 6. This high prevalence of seropositivity suggests that most people experience an acute HCoV infection during childhood. Therefore, HCoV is a possible causative agent of Kawasaki disease, although other factors, including genetic background, could also be involved in the development of Kawasaki disease.",

To detect viral genes in specimens, sampling must be performed at a critical time; if the virus infection does not persist and the samples are collected after the infection is over, then the detection of viral genes is quite difficult. Therefore, we performed a serological study to examine the involvement of HCoV\u2010NL63 in Kawasaki disease. HCoV\u2010229E was included as a control for HCoV\u2010NL63. For the serological test, paired serum samples from patients with Kawasaki disease who had not been treated with \u03b3\u2010globulin and matched control sera were examined.

All Kawasaki disease cases met diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease and thus judged as definitive Kawasaki disease patients. There was no suspected case. Two of them showed cardiac complication, and one of them showed coronary artery ectasia in both acute and recovery phases. Other cases did not show coronary lesions. Control serum specimens collected from healthy children from 2001 to 2002 were obtained from the serum bank at the NIID. Since there was insufficient serum to perform all of the neutralizing tests, the control samples were separated randomly into two groups [group 1 (23 specimens) and group 2 (29 specimens)], and one was used for a neutralizing test with VSV\u2010pseudotyped viruses while the other was used for a neutralizing test with infectious HCoV\u2010229E. The details of the specimens are shown in Table I. No statistical difference in age and sex was detected among control serum and specimens from patients with Kawasaki disease.

To neutralize the VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus, ca. 500 GFP count viruses were mixed with DMEM containing 5% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and serum (diluted 1:100). For infectious HCoV\u2010229E, ca. 100 PFU of virus were mixed with DMEM containing 5% TPB, 1% normal rabbit serum, and the specimen (diluted 1:20). Then, the samples were incubated for 60 min at 4\u00b0C and inoculated onto the HeLa cell monolayers. The viruses were allowed to adsorb for 1 hr at 34\u00b0C and the cells were washed three times with DMEM. Next, the infected cells were cultured with DMEM containing 5% FCS (for VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus) or 10% TPB and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (for infectious HCoV\u2010229E).

[2005a] reported that HCoV\u2010NL63 was possibly associated with Kawasaki disease based on detection of the viral genome in specimens using RT\u2010PCR; however, these observations have not been confirmed using the same method. Therefore, we examined the association of HCoV\u2010NL63 with Kawasaki disease by the serological method using Immunofluorescence assays (Fig. 1). A standard strain of HCoV\u2010229E (VR740) was used as a control for HCoV\u2010NL63. The positive and negative age\u2010 and region\u2010matched controls for the test were set for each experiment, and positivity was determined by comparison with these controls (Fig. 1a). As shown in Figure 1b, no difference in HCoV\u2010NL63 antibody positivity was detected between the patients with Kawasaki disease and controls, indicating that there was no valid association between HCoV\u2010NL63 and Kawasaki disease. This result supported the findings by several groups that reported no detection of HCoV\u2010NL\u201063 gene in Kawasaki disease specimens [Belay et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Shimizu et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Dominguez et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2009]. Surprisingly, HCoV\u2010229E showed higher positivity in the sera from Kawasaki disease patients, and the difference between the recovery\u2010phase and control groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). This result suggests that HCoV\u2010229E, but not HCoV\u2010NL63, is related to the development of Kawasaki disease. Therefore, in a subsequent survey, focus was on HCoV\u2010229E as the causative agent of Kawasaki disease.",

Therefore, these two viruses were used to estimate the relationship between HCoV\u2010229E and Kawasaki disease development. First, the neutralizing profiles of control specimens were analyzed (Fig. 2). For the neutralizing tests, because the concentrated serum contained a factor that non\u2010specifically blocked infection of the pseudotype virus, the sera were diluted 1:100 for the VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus and 1:20 for infectious HCoV\u2010229E. The control sera showed around 30% positivity in neutralizing tests using the VSV\u2010pseudotype viruses and about 10% positivity using infectious HCoV\u2010229E viruses; no significant difference in positivity was detected between VR\u2010740 and Sendai\u2010H. If HCoV\u2010229E were a causative agent of Kawasaki disease, then seroconversion would be detected in sera collected from the acute and recovery phases of Kawasaki disease. Thus, the levels of HCoV\u2010229E neutralizing antibodies in sera obtained from both phases in patients with Kawasaki disease was examined (Fig. 3). The study using VSV\u2010pseudotype viruses showed that the positivity for VR740 in the acute phase was 13%, while that in the recovery phase was 20%. When examined with infectious viruses, the respective values for VR740 were 13% and 27%. For Sendai\u2010H, the VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus showed that the positivity rates in the acute and recovery phases were 53% and 80%, respectively; however, while using infectious Sendai\u2010H, the respective rates were 20% and 40%. The positivity in the recovery phases seemed to be higher than that in the acute phases; however, no statistically significant difference in seropositivity was detected between them for both viruses. These results suggest that HCoV\u2010229E infection is not a direct trigger of Kawasaki disease. Even in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease, the viral infection had already subsided and antibodies were produced.",

However, \u03b3\u2010globulin transfers are generally used as a treatment for Kawasaki disease, and this treatment would confuse the serum antibody profile in serological tests. Therefore, the paired serum specimens obtained from Kawasaki disease patients who had not received \u03b3\u2010globulin during the disease was examined.",

Using these isolates as targets for the neutralizing test, the possible role of HCoV\u2010229E in patients with Kawasaki disease was evaluated. Using VR\u2010740 of HCoV\u2010229E as the antigen, higher positivity was observed by immunofluorescence assays in Kawasaki disease specimens than in controls. In contrast, higher positivity was shown in Kawasaki disease specimens in neutralizing test using Sendai\u2010H, though it was not clearly observed in VR740. Although the neutralizing antigenicity of VR\u2010740 is different from that of Sendai\u2010H [Shirato et al., 2012], VR\u2010740 and Sendai\u2010H showed some cross reactivity by immunofluorescence assays (data not shown). Therefore, it is assumed that greater positivity in Kawasaki disease specimens could be observed by immunofluorescence assays, even using Sendai\u2010H as the antigen, as compared with the results of VR\u2010740.",

Sendai\u2010H was isolated recently from a Japanese patient with a common cold and Sendai\u2010H\u2010related viruses are prevalent currently among patients from Japan and other countries [Chibo and Birch, 2006; Shirato et al., 2012]. In contrast, VR\u2010740, an initial strain isolated in the 1960s [Hamre and Procknow, 1966], is not prevalent currently in Australia and Japan [Chibo and Birch, 2006; Shirato et al., 2012]. These facts are in good agreement with the finding that a recent case of Kawasaki disease examined in this study was related to HCoV\u2010229E Sendai\u2010H rather than VR740. Moreover, a mild cold is known to precede the onset of Kawasaki disease and, thus, the agent that causes this respiratory disease could be a good candidate to trigger Kawasaki disease. The present study suggests that HCoV\u2010229E could be one possible candidate. To test this hypothesis, a large\u2010scale serological surveillance of Kawasaki disease, before and after onset, is required.",

It is also suggested that new endothelial cell antigens induced by cytokine production, and generation of autoantibodies directed to these antigen caused the endothelial cell injury in Kawasaki disease [Leung, 1991]. However, in this study, there is no increase in antibody for HCoV\u2010NL63 even if polyclonal B cell activation occurred, suggesting that our results would not result from such polyclonal B cell activation.",

One possible explanation for this result is that the virus infection has already subsided when Kawasaki disease is first apparent in patients, and that the antibody against HCoV\u2010229E is already present even in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease. In the recovery phase, a slight increase in positivity may occur, although such an increase was not statistically significant in our study. Alternatively, many cases of Kawasaki disease examined in the present study may not seem serious. Serious cases are normally treated with \u03b3\u2010globulin transfer in about 80% of patients with Kawasaki disease in Japan [Yanagawa et al., 1995d]. Virus infection may not have been intense in patients with Kawasaki disease and, thus, the antibody response was low. Future studies would be facilitated by the availability of sera from normal individuals before Kawasaki disease onset and before \u03b3\u2010globulin treatment after Kawasaki disease onset. Such cohort studies would be invaluable in determining whether HCoV is the Kawasaki disease triggering agent.",

On the other hand, it is reported that Kawasaki disease cases increase in summer and winter [Burns et al., 2005]. Therefore, it makes sense to postulate that HCoV\u2010229E is a possible causative agent for Kawasaki disease if HCoV\u2010229E infection occurs through the year, though it is very likely that some environmental and genetic factors, in addition to virus infection, considerably influence the development of Kawasaki disease.",
