Herein, we evaluated the feasibility of performing nanofiltration of platelet lysates and determined the impact on expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs. Methods: Platelet lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing of pathogen-reduced (Intercept\u00ae) PCs suspended in 65% storage solution (SPP+) and 35% plasma, and by serum-conversion of PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Lysates were added to the MSC growth media at 10% (v/v), filtered, and subjected to cascade nanofiltration on 35 and 19-nm Planova filters. Media supplemented with 10% starting platelet lysates or FBS were used as the controls. Impacts of nanofiltration on the growth media composition, removal of platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs), and MSC expansion were evaluated. Results: Nanofiltration did not detrimentally affect contents of total protein and growth factors, or the biochemical composition. The clearance factor of PEVs was over 3 log values.",

Compared to FBS, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes were expressed more in nanofiltered media, and there were fewer senescent cells over six passages. Conclusions: Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with two types of platelet lysates, including one prepared from pathogen-reduced PCs, is technically feasible. These data support the possibility of developing pathogen-reduced xeno-free growth media for clinical-grade propagation of human cells.",

Consistency in quality and performance requires the pooling of a sufficient number of PC donations to counterbalance variability among donors (1, 2, 11, 12) . Pooling, however, increases the risk of contamination by blood-borne pathogens, notably viruses, despite donor screening and donation testing for infectious agents, as the sensitivity and selectivity of these two measures have limits (5) . Particular concerns exist with regards to untested emerging viruses, such as West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, or coronaviruses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) -1 or -2, if they are present in an infectious form in the blood of asymptomatic donors (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . The ultimate approach to ensure the pathogen safety of pooled lysates, as for any pooled blood products, is by implementing one or two robust and complementary pathogen inactivation or removal treatments (18, 19) . Among those, one robust pathogen removal technology is nanofiltration, a step of filtration using membranes of a few nanometers capable of removing viruses, and possibly other pathogens like prions, based on size-exclusion (20, 21) .",

Pooling of a minimum number of allogeneic PC donations, is needed to ensure platelet lysate consistency in quality and performance (5, 27, 28) , increases viral risks (5, 19, 29) . Lysates can now be prepared from PC donations that have been pathogen-reduced by psoralen/UVA (30, 31) or UV (32) treatments, without detrimentally affecting the MSC expansion capacity compared to FBS, thereby providing an important step forward in virus safety. Application of pathogen reduction by psoralen/UVA treatment after platelet lysis (33) , and gamma-irradiation of pooled HPL (19) may also be alternative feasible approaches recently evaluated. However, all pathogen-reduction technologies have limits in their capacities, and pooling increases the risk of contamination by (a) window period donations, (b) viruses that are not tested for, (c) emerging infectious agents, and potentially (d) prions (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) 19) . These reasons make the implementation of \"orthogonal\" pathogen-reduction treatments of platelet lysates, as done for a long time in the plasma fractionation industry (34, 35) , highly desirable as stressed in recent publications (5, 19, 29) . We recently showed the feasibility of preparing platelet lysates subjected to psoralen/UVA and solvent/detergent (22) , a treatment that is highly efficient against lipid-enveloped viruses (34) (35) (36) . However, combining these two treatments may not eliminate the risk of transmission of non-enveloped viruses (37, 38) , such as hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, and parvovirus B19, justifying exploration for other pathogen-reduction procedures.",

Due to its reliability and robustness, nanofiltration is widely used in the plasma fractionation and biotech industries to ensure the safety of licensed biologicals made from mammalian sources against pathogens (20, 21, 39) . Virus removal achieved by both the 35-and 20-nm nanofilters has been shown to be robust including for known small viruses such as parvovirus B19 using a wide range of filtration conditions (20, (39) (40) (41) . Nanofiltration on small-pore-size filters of \u226435 nm was also found in experimental models to be effective at removing several log levels of prions (42, 43) . It was therefore relevant to assess whether nanofiltration can be considered as a means to improve HPL virus safety.",

To answer this question, we used two types of platelet lysates that are representative of those currently used by the cell therapy industry (10) . One was prepared from non-pathogenreduced PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Platelet lysates from this source material were serum-converted by calcium chloride activation, as described by others before (1), to remove fibrinogen and avoid the need for heparin addition during cell culture (10) . Removal of fibrinogen, and other highmolecular-mass coagulation factors during fibrin formation, from this lysate made from PCs in 100% plasma can also facilitate the nanofiltration process, since fibrinogen solutions are known to be difficult to nanofilter on 20-nm membranes (44) . The other platelet lysate was produced from PCs subjected to psoralen/UVA pathogen reduction, and suspended in a 65% SSP+ additive solution and 35% plasma. This lysate was not serumconverted, as we speculated that the partial removal of plasma, resulting in a major decrease in the total protein content, could facilitate the nanofiltration process. Both HPLs were prepared from outdated PCs collected by apheresis due to availability of this material for our study.",

Medium nanofiltration was selected because (a) filtering the raw platelet lysates could result in nanofilter clogging, and (b) it eliminates risks of contaminating cell cultures by adventitious pathogens that could originate from operators or raw materials (45) , as evidenced by the commercial availability of dedicated medium filters following viral contamination of recombinant proteins (46, 47) .",

The reasons for the decreases in the contents of BDNF, PDGF-AB, and PF4 due to the nanofiltration process were unclear considering their low molecular masses, but could have been due to nonspecific adsorption onto the nanofilters, as was observed before with hydrophobic chromatographic media (48) . However, the overall concentrations of growth factors evaluated remained within the expected range of platelet lysate-supplemented media (3, 10, 49) . A DLS analysis of the nanofiltered media showed the disappearance of the main PEV population of approximately 70 nm. The possibility of preparing PEV-depleted media for MSC culture is of interest as this avoids or decreases the risks of contaminating MSC-EVs used for clinical applications by EVs originating from growth medium supplements like FBS or platelet lysates (50) (51) (52) .",

Such studies should indeed be performed by HPL-media suppliers or users, following existing guidelines, once exact manufacturing conditions are defined. However, there is ample information in the literature to support the robustness of nanofiltration at removing viruses and other pathogenic agents larger that the membrane pore-size (20, 21, 39) . In particular, nanofiltration of plasma protein products using filters with a pore size of 35 or 19 nm provides a robust removal of emerging blood-borne viruses. For instance, clearance factor of over 4 log 10 of West Nile virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus and model viruses with a size of approximately 40-50nm, can readily be achieved when filtering various protein solutions on 35 or 19 nm-filters identical to those used in this study (39, 73) . Consistent removal of smaller viruses, like hepatitis A virus (27 nm), human parvovirus B19 (23-28 nm), or human poliovirus-1 (30 nm), has also been found using the 19-nm nanofilter (21, 40, 74) . An extensive data collection from the Plasma Protein Therapeutic Association, reflecting 20 years of experience in the manufacture of human plasmaderived proteins, \"substantiates the effectiveness and robustness of nanofiltration in virus removal\" (75). The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates the theoretical risk of virus contamination of ancillary material essential to cell therapy procedures. It is, therefore, critical to implement robust in-process virus reduction procedures capable of counterbalancing efficiently the virus risks associated with the source material or arising from possible air-borne contamination. Coronaviruses, which have a size of close to 80 to 120 nm, should be readily removed by nanofilters with a pore size of 35 or 19 nm if present in the cell culture medium.",

            "text": "In conclusion, although the performance of the HPL was partially affected by nanofiltration, our data support the technical feasibility of applying a dedicated pathogen-removal nanofiltration step of growth media supplemented with two standard human platelet lysates. In particular, nanofiltration can be applied to lysates derived from pathogen-reduced PCs, making the end-product for cell expansion subjected to two complementary reduction treatments. The robustness of such nanofiltration process to remove viruses and prions should be validated by HPL users on a case-by-case basis using relevant experimental models and following guidelines. The possibility of implementing nanofiltration and double pathogen-reduction steps may turn out to offer a favorable cost/benefit ratio for the future industrial development of pooled human platelet lysates as safe supplements for the ex vivo propagation of MSC-based medicinal products. C, D, and E respectively represent cell viability at passages 4, 5, and 6 in 24-and 72-hours culture conditions. Viability was assessed using the CCK-8 reagent, and the OD was measured by an ELISA reader at a 450-nm wavelength. FBS culture used as the standard was set to 100%. Values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD; N=3. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001; ns, no significant difference. * FBS or 10% HPL in DMEM vs HPL filtered; # I-HPL vs mNF-IHPL; + SCPL vs mNF-SCPL. *, #, or + p < 0.05; **, ##, or ++ p < 0.01; ***, ###, or +++ p < 0.001; ****, ####, or ++++ p < 0.0001.",
