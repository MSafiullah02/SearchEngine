However, under public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, the work strategies of clinical pharmacists need to be modified according to the rapid spread of the disease, where information and resources are usually lack to guide them. Objective: To retrieve and investigate the prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists during the outbreak of novel coronavirus, summarize the roles and responsibilities of clinical pharmacists, and to propose innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services under the epidemic. Methods: The Chinese and English databases, self-media network, website of professional society or medical institution, and clinical trial center platforms were searched, and clinical pharmacists involved in the work against COVID-19 were surveyed and interviewed. Investigate the challenges and needs of frontline medical staffs for treating patients, and formulate strategies based on the actual medical environment. Results: Clinical pharmacists play a vital role in leading the industry to formulate work instructions, provide frontline medical staff with drug information, and develop innovative pharmacy services to promote the rational use of medicines with collaborative teamwork and close communication according to the epidemic situation of COVID-19. Anti-epidemic work indeed has driven the development of remote pharmacy services. Conclusion: Facing public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists can give full play to their professional expertise, analyze the current situation rationally, formulate telehealth strategies swiftly, and work in a united and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services to ensure medication safety and rational use of medicine.",

On the same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease caused by this virus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Following the advice of the Emergency Committee, the WHO Director-General has declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a \"public health emergency of international concern\" and pandemic, for the reason that the virus might spread to countries that do not have robust health systems. 3 As of April 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has caused 896,450 infections and 45,526 deaths worldwide, which is a tragic milestone. 4 With the continuous changes in the COVID-19 pandemic situation, more than 40 thousand of medical personnel nationwide rush to Hubei and several expert teams sent abroad by Chinese authorities to Italy, Iran and Iraq to aid the pandemic fighting, and a few medical teams sent clinical pharmacists to participate in the treatment of COVID-19. It's important to offer both complicated treatment of ICU patients to reduce mortality, and comprehensive treatment of mild and general patients to improve the cure rate.",
