To achieve this goal, China launched a nationwide systemic reform in 2009, supported by infusions of substantial public funding. The reform marked a departure from the market-oriented strategy used after the liberalisation of the economy in 1978, and re-instated the government's role in the financing of health care and provision of public goods. In only 4 years, the reform produced substantial positive results in expansion of insurance coverage and strengthening of the infrastructure of primary health-care facilities, but much still needs to be done to reform China's health-care delivery. Particularly, China faces major challenges in transformation of its underperforming hospital-centric, fragmented system into one that delivers high-quality and efficient care to meet the emerging health needs and rising patient expectations associated with rapid ageing, environmental deterioration, urbanisation, and other socioeconomic transformations.",

Guided by the principle of equity, the reform departed from the previous market approach and re-instated the government's role in health care, increasing annual public spending from \u00a5481\u00b76 billion to \u00a5836\u00b76 billion (US$1 is roughly equal to \u00a56\u00b75) between 2009 and 2012.1 Before the reform, there was heated debate about whether additional government funding should be given as a direct budget to the providers (supply-side approach) or channelled through insurance programmes that then purchase services from providers (demand-side approach).",

The rationale of the 20% target and whether the government intends further market expansion beyond 2015 remains unknown. Companion policies putting private hospitals on equal footing with public hospitals are being introduced\u2014eg, the three insurance schemes would contract with private hospitals, and physicians working in the private hospitals would qualify for promotion within the medical professional ranking system.11 At the same time, no new building projects or expansion of public hospital beds will be approved. How the government plans to regulate the private hospitals and, more importantly, can regulations be effectively enforced in the Chinese context, are both open questions at the moment. Overall, whether additional government financing would produce effective health care that serves the needs of its population depends crucially on whether China can find a workable and sustainable strategy to reform its delivery system.",

The scientific literature shows that integrated care encompasses a wide range of interventions whose effects are dependent on the specific design of the programme and the contexts in which they are implemented. A synthesis of evidence from 19 systematic reviews suggests that available evidence \u201cpoints to a positive impact of integrated care programmes on the quality of patient care and improved health or patient satisfaction outcomes but uncertainty remains about the relative effectiveness of different approaches and their impacts on costs\u201d.31 However, it remains \u201cchallenging to interpret the evidence from existing primary studies, which tend to be characterised by heterogeneity in the definition and description of the intervention and components of care under study\u201d.31 The authors also emphasise the importance of assessment of integrated care as a complex strategy to innovate and implement long standing change in service delivery that includes several changes at many levels, rather than one intervention.31\nPanel 1Examples of integrated care and evidence of its effectsIntegrated care schemes differ widely in the degree of integration, target population, and scope of interventions.20, 21 Fully integrated models are uncommon. Kaiser Permanente and the Veterans Health Administration (VA) in the USA are rare examples. Findings from one study22 showed that when Kaiser Permanente stratifies its patients into levels of care and enrols high-risk patients into specific disease management programmes for more intensive case management, the percentage of hypertensive patients with blood pressure under control has more than doubled and admissions to hospital for coronary heart disease and stroke decreased by 30% and 20%, respectively, between 1998 and 2007. Findings from other studies showed that participants in the Care Coordination/Home Telehealth programme for diabetes in the VA were 50% less likely to be admitted to hospital and 11% less likely to have an emergency room visit 1 year after enrolment.23, 24, 25 However, these results were based on before and after comparisons.Results from assessments of disease management programme are mixed, in large part dependent on the specific programme designs, the population covered, and the contexts in which the intervention took place. Ofman and colleagues26 reviewed 102 studies representing 11 chronic conditions to assess the clinical and economic effects of disease management. They identified that in patients with depression, high cholesterol, cardiac insufficiency, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes, those who received coordinated care were more likely to see improvements than were patients in control groups who received normal care.26 Gohler and colleagues27 did a meta-analysis of 36 studies spanning 13 countries that compared the coordinated management with care of congestive heart failure and identified a 3% reduction in mortality and an 8% reduction in re-hospitalisations, compared with regular care. Kruis and colleagues28 reviewed randomised controlled trials assessing integrated disease management programmes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and noted that integrated programmes reduced hospital admissions and length of stay but had no effect on mortality between comparison and control groups. However, another Cochrane review29 on integration of services that are usually delivered through vertical programmes, such as HIV/AIDS, family planning, and maternal child health into primary health services in low-income and middle-income countries, showed no evidence of improved health-care delivery or health status. This Review differs from others in looking at integration of several services for different health conditions in one health-care provider, rather than coordination of different providers involved in treating one health condition. Similarly, the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration\u2014a systematic assessment of disease management and care coordination\u2014identified no difference in hospital admissions in 13 of 15 randomised controlled studies and no effect on Medicare expenditures overall between 2002 and 2006. However, the 15 selected host programmes differed widely in their organisational structure, target populations, and approach to coordination. The authors note the potential of replication of results from the two successful programmes by promotion of key programme features. These features included frequent in-person patient contact with coordinators, close ties between care coordinators and physicians, and links with local hospitals to ease the transition after hospital admission.30\nExamples of integrated care for elderly people include the North American Programme for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) in the USA and the Torbay Care Trust in the UK. Although the first targets elderly people who live in communities within a set service area, Torbay focuses on high-risk patients who need intensive ongoing support from community nurses and wider integrated teams. Both programmes experienced a decrease in inpatient and nursing home use, especially emergency visits, and an increase in home and community-based services. PACE also decreased Medicare costs in comparison to non-enrolees, whererase Torbay delivered improved system performance at no additional cost.19 Generally, rigorous assessments of integrated care for the elderly population are scarce because many of them are relatively new.",

In practice, there is no single model of the primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model that would fit all nations. Many countries (even those with advanced economies) still experiment with models that suit their contexts best. However, a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model, that focuses on population-based prevention and care coordination offers a rational course for China to pursue given the changing needs of its population. Similar to other nations that have embarked on this course, China would have to innovate and discover its own model, accompanied with objective and ongoing monitoring and assessment to allow for suitable adjustments along the way.

            "text": "Primary health-care centres and hospitals in China operate independently and compete for patients. We predict that this situation will persist for several reasons. First, providers of all facility levels are mainly paid by fee-for-service, creating incentives to increase activities rather than improve patient health. Providers have no incentive to coordinate care with other health-care professionals because their financial interest is to keep rather than refer patients to an appropriate site of treatment. The government has announced a shift from fee-for-service to other forms of provider payment, such as case-based payments, capitation, and global budget. However, they have so far been implemented as facility-specific rather than population-based payments, and therefore, do not provide incentives for several providers to coordinate care decisions. Second, fragmentation in finance creates barriers for the integration of services. Although primary health-care providers are mostly financed by government subsidies to provide primary care, hospitals are paid by SHIs and patient out-of-pocket payments. Primary health-care facilities have no financial leverage over hospitals. Third, in many cases SHI coverage is more generous for inpatient than outpatient services, incentivising patients to seek hospital care first because, generally, patients do not trust the quality of primary health-care facilities. All these factors make it difficult for primary health care to have a gatekeeping role. Exacerbation of this situation means that, within the medical profession, specialists are held in high esteem, whereas primary health-care providers are not well respected, creating further barriers for them to have the care-coordinator role. Perhaps the greatest barrier to a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model approach is the dominant profit-driven hospital sector, irrespective of whether the hospital is public or private.",

            "text": "China is starting to pilot some models of integrated care (panel 2\n). Because these pilots are ongoing, no assessment has been done yet. Instead, we compare features from the Chinese pilots with several facilitating characteristics that have emerged in reviewing of the international scientific literature about successful care integration. The most common features include provider and patient incentives, decision support for providers, information communication technology, and a clearly defined role for primary health care (table 2\n). Although these pilots score well in movement towards an integrated health information system, they generally do not have appropriate providers and patient incentives and dedicated care coordinators. In fact, most Chinese pilots are led by tertiary hospitals and were set up to capture market share, with lower-level facilities agreeing to refer patients to them exclusively.Panel 2Chinese pilots of integrated careIn 2005, Pudong district in Shanghai began to pilot the so-called 2 + 1 model, which integrates a secondary hospital with several community hospitals. Pioneered by the Waigaoqiao Medical Group,37 this model includes Shanghai number seven People's Hospital and four community health centres. Patients who obtain referrals from the community health centres can get fast-track appointments at the hospitals.Another common model is 3 + 2 + 1, which includes tertiary hospitals, secondary hospitals, and community health centres. This model is usually set up by a tertiary hospital. In principle, the head of the board of the network is usually a director from the tertiary hospital. The tertiary hospital takes the main responsibility for definition of the roles and responsibilities of each level of provider in the network. There are no explicit care coordination functions in these models. This model was piloted by two medical groups in Shanghai in 2011\u2014Ruijin-Luwan and Xinhua-Chongming. Ruijing Hospital and the Xinhua Hospital Chongming Branch are the tertiary hospitals at the core of this three-tiered integrated delivery system.38 They are supported by two secondary hospitals and several primary facilities. Around ten to 15 medical groups using the 3 + 2 + 1 model will be established in Shanghai and more than 20 in Beijing will be developed to cover the whole municipality.39, 40\nBecause many of these pilots started not long ago or are still in the planning phase, there is no concrete evidence to show the effect of hospital integration. However, problems are emerging, particularly because of the bi-directional nature of referrals\u2014in practice, only referrals to higher level hospitals work because of the relatively low-quality of care in primary hospitals.",

On the one hand, they are governed by bureaucratic rules and subject to conflicting policies from the many ministries that govern them.2 Hospital directors and managerial staff are mostly government-appointed officials who are accountable to the government.53 They do not have any autonomy over hiring and firing decisions, which are restricted by rigid Civil Service Rules.54 On the other hand, public hospitals are motivated by profits and behave similarly to any other for-profit organisation. They have built-in incentives to prescribe excessive diagnostic tests and pharmaceuticals to earn profits for distribution to physicians and finance hospital expansion. Most public hospitals have to earn 90% of their revenue from services provided, with government direct subsidies making up the rest. Meanwhile, the government sets fee schedules with prices for office visits and hospital bed-days set below cost and the latest diagnostic and medical technologies set above cost. Providers are allowed to charge a 15% mark-up on drugs. Physicians are incentivised to prescribe drugs and tests that are not clinically needed because their bonuses are frequently tied to these revenues.55, 56, 57, 58, 59 For these same reasons, hospital managers race to introduce high-tech services and expensive imported drugs to boost revenues. In this way, many public facilities act as private entities, putting profit above patient welfare.60, 61 To compound the problem, pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies provide hospitals and physicians with benefits for prescription of their products. All these have resulted in the large share of health expenditure spent on drugs in China. In 2011, expenditure on drugs as a share of total health expenditure was 43% percent compared with an OECD average of 16%,62 and drug revenues accounted for 41\u00b74% of total hospital revenues.6 Because physician staff are the residual claimants of profits in public hospitals, they are de facto shareholders of the public hospitals. Hence, public hospitals have neither the motivation nor the incentive to integrate care with primary health-care providers or make treatment decisions based on cost-effectiveness or population health maximisation criteria.",

Entrance of private investment will further exacerbate these trends. To remain solvent, insurance programmes might limit payments, reduce resources for primary health-care services, and pass the higher costs on to patients as out-of-pocket costs. A two-tier system would emerge, with rich people serviced by the for-profit private hospitals and another tier for the rest of the population, leading to unequal access to and quality of care.

We take as a starting point that the government will continue to fund basic health care, mainly through SHI, with some direct funding to primary health-care facilities and that it is highly unlikely that the government will reverse course to directly pay hospitals from government budgets; and that the for-profit private hospital market share will continue to grow as a result of government policies and increased demand from a population with rising income.

Public hospitals would charge patients fees according to the government fee schedule (revised to cover actual costs) while private hospitals set their own prices subject to government regulation. However, to ensure that patients with a low income are able to afford these non-basic services, hospitals would offer two or three classes of wards, from which patients could freely choose. Services in different wards would differ only in amenities and waiting time for elective procedures, but not clinical quality. Patients in all wards would be treated by the same team of physicians. Similar to the Singaporean model, class A wards offering more conveniences (eg, a private room) would be charged at cost, whereas class C wards offering less comforts would be subsidised at a much higher percentage of cost to assure equal clinical quality of treatment.108, 109\n",

The challenges that it faces are complex and there is no stand-alone policy that would provide the magic bullet. We suggest a systemic approach that integrates benchmark competition, improved public hospital accountability, stronger coordination across levels of care, and increased performance-based purchasing to leverage changes in health-care delivery towards a more cost-effective and high-quality system that serves the changing needs of China's population.",

We limited results to articles, book chapters, or reports classified as reviews. We excluded earlier reviews that were included in more recent papers. For subjects of which no reviews exist, we also reviewed individual studies. Database searches include PubMed, journal storage (JSTOR), Wiley Online Library, and Google Scholar. For coordinated or integrated care, we also searched the websites of organisations such as the King's Fund, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Observatory, and the Commonwealth Fund. We further refined the results to chronic disease treatment or management. For descriptive reviews, we excluded reviews that included only one country. The search was complemented by references cited in relevant studies and suggestions from peer-reviewers. We included studies published between Jan 1, 1999 and June 17, 2014. For the examples of Chinese pilots of integrated care, we searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang for Chinese language papers using key words \u201cyi lian ti\u201d or \u201cyi liao lian he ti\u201d (in Chinese).
