With the increase in overseas returnees and visitors to China, Hangzhou sets up a working group, including health-care workers and staffs from public security, transportation, foreign affairs and other non-medical system, responsible for quarantine work. Proper wear and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) becomes a critical measure to ensure the safety of frontline personnel. This study intends to carry out the practice of pollutant simulation, so as to grasp the key point of PPE removal and guarantees the safety of frontline staffs.",

Forty-six frontline staffs from non-medical systems were selected to carry out the pollutant simulation test. According to the characteristics of the phosphors which can be identified by naked eyes under ultraviolet irradiation, we dissolved the phosphors in gel -like ethanol as pollutant. We applied the phosphors on the outer surface of the gloves, forearms of the whole-body protective gowns, the outer surface of the gown hat, and the bare outer surface of kn95 respirator. After removing the PPE, we irradiated the clothes and the exposed skin through the ultraviolet lamp to show the risk points during the removal process.",

Hand hygiene is considered the most economical, convenient and efficient way to control hospital infection [3, 4] ,it is of great significance to enhance the awareness of hand hygiene [5] . To reduce the risk of infection, we should pay more attention to the removal of PPE without contamination as well as its supply. ",
