Human adenoviruses (HAdV) belong to the Adenoviridae family of DNA viruses with seven subgroups and 52 known serotypes. HAdV are a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children, immunocompromised adults3 and adults in closed settings (particularly those in the military).4 For immunocompetent adults, prospective studies in the published work (pregnant women were excluded) showed that the adenovirus, especially serotype 7, is an important cause of CAP, accounting for 3.7% (18/487), 4% (11/304), and 5% (48/969) of CAP.5, 6, 7 The seeming rarity of these cases might be due to the physicians' unawareness of viral infection and the unavailability of methods to detect this virus in most hospitals.",

The reported rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome of adenovirus\u2010associated CAP in the general population is 4.2%.5 Previous studies have shown that pregnant women with viral pneumonia, such as influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, have a higher mortality rate and higher rates of both intubation and intensive care unit admission than the general population.9, 10 The increased severity of viral infections in pregnancy is believed to be related to physiologic changes in pregnancy and immunologic alterations result in a shift away from cell\u2010mediated immunity.1 In addition, increased adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery, low\u2010birthweight infants, spontaneous abortion and fetal death, are higher in pregnant patients with H1N1 pneumonia than those without.11, 12 The same cases were also reported in pregnant women with SARS.13 The effects of adenovirus on pregnant women and their fetuses need further large\u2010scale clinical studies.",
