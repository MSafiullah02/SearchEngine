Aptamers can fold into a complex three-dimensional motif with a variety of functions, such as ligand, catalysis, and gene regulation [6, 7] . In 1990, Craig Tuerk and Larry Gold designed systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) [4] , which remains the recognized method for aptamer screening today. The precision and efficiency of each SELEX's step are the key to successful aptamer screening [8, 9] . However, the screening process still faces some bottlenecks, which hinder the development and application of aptamers. In fact, there are two key steps that affect the screening efficiency. (i) Formation and separation of complex. The target is mixed with the NA library to form a complex, and the bound sequences in complex are separated from the unbound sequences. (ii) Purification and preparation of high-quality sub-libraries, e.g. PCR amplification of the sequence in complex to prepare a high-fidelity sub-library.",

            "text": "Currently, the commonly used separation methods such as magnetic bead and affinity microcolumn involve the use of solid media, which not only requires tedious fixation of targets, but also causes the non-specific binding generated by the media, thus increasing the screening steps and interfering factors [10, 11] . Whereas, capillary electrophoresis (CE) method does not require media, maintains the natural molecular state of the target to bind to the NAs, achieves efficient separation of complexes in free solution, and provides information about both complex and unbound NAs during the separation process [12, 13] . In addition, CE has the outstanding advantages of enabling both qualitative quantification and analytical evaluation of SELEX process [12] , and is one of the recognized efficient screening techniques. Until now, more than 30 targets' aptamers have been screened using CE-SELEX and their application have been evaluated [13] . Our group has been conducting CE-SELEX research with the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China since 2007. During this period, we translated two monographs, \"Handbook of Nucleic Acid Aptamers\" and \"Nucleic Acid Aptamers in Biological Analysis\" [14, 15] , and wrote the annual reviews of CE technology for eight consecutive years [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In the past thirteen years, we have established some efficient strategies and methods for aptamer screening, and have conducted in-depth research on the scientific issues, including the mechanism study, the key-steps investigation, and the characteristics for different targets' screening. This paper summarizes our group's work on CE application before, during and after aptamer screening process, the classification and screening strategies against different protein targets, various CE screening modes, and aptamer screening for multi-scale targets. Finally, some development prospects in SELEX are proposed. The evaluation and characterization of purity, stability, storage conditions, and charge state (Isoelectric point, pI) of protein targets are essential for effective screening. In particular, for laboratory-produced proteins, characterization and quality evaluation prior to screening are more necessary. By CE, analytical evaluation can be achieved easily using only a very small amount of samples [23] , and problems from the sample itself that affect the screening results could be avoided. For completely unknown proteins, their pI and molecular weights (MW) can be accurately determined using capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF), capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), or they can be evaluated comparatively by neutral molecules and protein markers [24] . The nature of the small molecule target is known and there are generally no sample stability and purity issues that require special consideration. Cell and microbe samples [25] [26] [27] are nonhomogeneous and are affected by sample culture conditions and production. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a single peak by CE, which shows little evaluation significance.",

Commercialized NA libraries may have quality or batch differences, and CE can be used to readily assess them from different manufacturers, purification methods, fluorescent labeling, samples status and solvents [28] . A divided method was developed based on the small differences in migration rates of NAs from the initial NA library [29] , which allowed the total library to be divided into several NA library, each having the reduced NA library capacity. The interaction between initial NA libraries of different sequence lengths and different protein targets was investigated [30, 31] and the results showed that different proteins were selective toward sequence lengths, suggesting that the choice about sequence lengths in NA library requires optimization before aptamer screening.",

By using different concentrations of the initial NA library, the aptamers with similar affinity of micromolar-level were obtained after two screening rounds, indicating that the input of the initial NA library did not significantly affect the screening efficiency. Initial NA library with high concentration may increase sequence diversity, but it does not determine their necessarily high affinity. It also suggests that the sequence diversity in NA library may not be the key to obtain high-affinity aptamers, and that trying to isolate sequences with high affinity is the key to successful screening.",

By using CE to optimize the screening conditions, the results are intuitive, the separation is fast, the sample consumption is minimal, and the workload and research costs are greatly reduced compared to conventional methods [12, 13] . Yang et al. [31] used apotransferrin as the model protein and observed that buffer type and pH, and incubation temperature affected the formation of target protein-ssDNA complexes. The addition of low concentrations of metal ions (e.g. K + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) promoted complex formation.

If the K D value continues to decrease, the screening continues. Also, if the K D value does not change significantly or is elevated, the screening should be terminated to reduce the unnecessary screening process. For example, Yang et al. [30] found that during the aptamer screening of the IgG Fc fragment, the K D values of the secondary and third sub-libraries consistently decreased, while K D value of the fourth sub-library was comparable to that of the third library and the decrease was not significant.

Even using CE-based methods of non-linear fitting and NECEEM, the results were also different [37] . In addition, when NECEEM method was used, the experimental conditions such as concentration ratio and separation temperature affected the peak area and K D values. Through an analysis based on the integral deviation method [41] about the K D errors, the maximum relative deviation of the K D was less than 7% when the peak area was within the deviation interval of 10%, so the conditionally induced peak area errors could be ignored.",

Judging from the electropherogram, different protein targets can be classified into three categories with high, medium and low affinity to establish screening strategies [42] . For high-affinity proteins, the electropherogram displayed visible complex peaks, and NA library peak area reduced more than 50%, along with a bulk K D of less than 50 \u03bcmol/L. This also indicated that the high-affinity proteins were not very selective for NA sequences and should be imposed on specificity screening. For medium-affinity proteins, the electropherogram displayed small complex peaks and visible dissociation regions, with a reduction in NA library peak area of about 30%, and a bulk K D of less than 1 mmol/L, which should be given equal consideration for their affinity and specificity screening. For low-affinity proteins, the complex peaks and dissociation regions were difficult to observe, and the peak area of the NA library was reduced by less than 10%, along with a bulk K D greater than 1 mmol/L, indicating that a very small number of sequences in the NA library were bound to the protein. Low-affinity proteins were difficult to form complexes with NAs, and the optimization of screening conditions or the use of modified NA libraries were required to obtain higher affinity aptamers. We evaluated the electropherogram characteristics, K D values, sequence affinity and specific evolutionary efficiency of 40 target proteins bound to the initial NA library, and analyzed the CE-SELEX screening process of more than 20 reported target proteins, and found that these proteins and screening methods were undoubtedly consistent with our proposed protein target classification model and screening strategy. Besides, due to the adsorption of alkaline proteins in the capillary wall, their aptamers' screening required to be performed in the conditions of inhibiting adsorption [43, 44] . By using CE to analyze the affinity of proteins and NA libraries, different screening strategies and screening schemes could be adopted for different proteins according to the electropherogram characteristics, avoiding blind screening and significantly improving screening efficiency.",

According to this method, aptamers of clenbuterol hydrochloride were obtained [40] .

Combining the current international progress on aptamer screening [8, [74] [75] [76] and the practical experience of our group, there are still some common problems with SELEX technology, such as lack of standardized screening procedures and methods, the difficulty in controlling the bias of PCR amplification in sub-library preparation and sequencing, the lack of effective analysis and selection from the large amounts of data generated by high-throughput sequencing, the lack of consistent evaluation methods for aptamer affinity, and how to achieve efficient screening and aptamer modification and function enhancement in real aptamer applications, etc. Also, these will be our research focus in the future.",
