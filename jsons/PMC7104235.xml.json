Preparation of northern countries for EVD treatment is based on two transmission models. Firstly, certain healthcare workers are involved in non-governmental organizations that help treat infected people [3]. As health workers, they are exposed to contaminated blood and other body fluids. Thus, they are particularly at risk of infection and may develop the disease, either in West Africa or back at home. Secondly, direct dissemination has been limited, despite the occurrence of the outbreak in cities with major commercial airports. During the current outbreak, 16 imported cases of Ebola have been reported in 6 countries (Italy, Mali, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States). Among the latter, 7 died. But due to the incubation period (from 2 to 21 days), it cannot be excluded that some people coming back from West Africa would declare the infection after their arrival in northern countries. Because of the severity of EVD, a fair amount of patients may require intensive care. As recently shown in two reports, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis were frequent in severe EVD cases [4], [5]. Common ICU therapy, including fluid therapy and dialysis, would help decrease mortality rates [6], [7].",

One of the main risks of contamination is contact with an infected patient, repatriated with the disease, be it already declared or not. Healthcare workers are particularly at risk of contamination [11]. To date, no aerosol transmission has been documented, nor transmission following healthy skin exposure. After contamination through human liquids (including saliva, blood, vomit, urine, etc.), the virus spreads in the organism and replicates itself at a high rate [1]. This leads to virus particles in the blood that can be as high as 107 plaque-forming unit/mL. The risk of transmission is very high, particularly for the medical teams. One of the goals when receiving an infected patient is to guarantee the best level of protection for healthcare providers. The risk of contamination for laboratory personnel is low thanks to laboratory procedures. To date, 4 accidents during laboratory work with Ebola virus have been reported: 1 case was fatal, 1 case was symptomatic and survived and in 2 cases there was no evidence that the accident resulted in infection and the patients survived [11]. Thus, one can assume the same level of risk for health team members. As recently seen in Spain, despite wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), a nurse was contaminated during the care of an infected patient [12]. In Texas, a delay in EVD diagnosis for a case in the emergency department led to the death of a healthcare worker and fear of several secondary cases [13]. These events underline the importance of hospital organization and the need for informing both public and healthcare workers. The PPEs in use in our centre are fluid impermeable.",

During the preparation of the Begin Military Teaching Hospital, a dedicated access to both the ICU and the infectious disease ward was identified, and a protected way to move a patient from the infectious ward to the ICU implemented. The procedures for corridor decontamination must be known and established. To ensure that healthcare workers are efficient in dressing with the PPE, several training sessions should be planned and supervised by experts (Fig. 1\n). This implies that the hospital provides wards with a sufficient number of PPEs. Even when they are considered skilled at putting on or taking off their PPE, healthcare workers must proceed in pairs, in order to verify they are not making any mistakes. Particular attention should be paid when undressing, which is the time period most as risk for contamination. Our team was taught how to undress correctly in order to avoid contact with the contaminated part of the PPE. Once the PPE is off, workers must thoroughly wash their hands with alcohol gel.",

If possible, the room must include a one-way access or keep forward access. If not possible, a dressing room should be provided close to the patient's room and the airlock will be used to get undressed, thus being considered an \u201corange\u201d area (Table 1).

            "text": "One must keep in mind that malaria is endemic in West Africa. On top of EVD, the patient could present other infections, particularly bacterial. The risks associated with handling blood may limit the availability of bacterial tests to BSL-4 tests only. As the sensibility of the malaria test we used is high, the question of malaria can be dealt with in this way. But concerning bacterial infections, the prescription of empirical wide-spectrum antibiotics without formal bacterial identification may be justified, particularly during the first days EVD. One must keep in mind the risk of multidrug-resistant bacteria, as recently described in a case of severe EVD [6]. If bacterial infection is suspected, every effort should be made to obtain bacterial cultures.",

The epidemic is still ongoing and according to specialists, the number of cases may exceed 20,000 by the end of the current year [27]. It is now clear that northern countries will be implicated in the care of EVD patients, both in the field and back at home. In this perspective, it is fundamental that certain identified, specific centres are ready to take care of such patients. The preparation of a modern ICU to treat an EVD patient in good conditions requires time and specific equipment. Staff training also requires time and must be done well prior to receiving the patient. To be efficient, preparation should be planned at a national level with help from public authorities, as was the case in France during the summer of 2014.",
