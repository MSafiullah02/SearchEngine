Rapid detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is critical to containing an FMD outbreak. Availability of a rapid, highly sensitive and specific, yet simple and field-deployable assay would support local decision-making during an FMDV outbreak. Here we report validation of a novel reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay that can be performed on a commercially available, compact and portable POCKIT TM analyser that automatically analyses data and displays '+' or '\u00c0' results. The FMDV RT-iiPCR assay targets the 3D region of the FMDV genome and was capable of detecting 9 copies of in vitro-transcribed RNA standard with 95% confidence. It accurately identified 63 FMDV strains belonging to all seven serotypes and showed no cross-reactivity with viruses causing similar clinical diseases in clovenhoofed animals. The assay was able to identify FMDV RNA in multiple sample types including oral, nasal and lesion swabs, epithelial tissue suspensions, vesicular and oral fluid samples, even before the appearance of clinical signs. Clinical sensitivity of the assay was comparable or slightly higher than the laboratorybased real-time RT-PCR assay in use. The assay was able to detect FMDV RNA in vesicular fluid samples without nucleic acid extraction. For RNA extraction from more complex sample types, a commercially available taco TM mini transportable magnetic bead-based, automated extraction system was used. This assay provides a potentially useful field-deployable diagnostic tool for rapid detection of FMDV in an outbreak in FMD-free countries or for routine diagnostics in endemic countries with less structured laboratory systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is considered the most contagious infectious disease of cloven-hoofed animals. Factors including excretion of large quantities of virus during infection, low infectious dose, multiple routes of transmission and ability to spread via aerosols for a long distance contribute to the highly contagious nature of this disease (Alexandersen et al., 2003) . FMD causes severe economic damages due to production losses (decrease milk production, poor growth rate and calf mortality) in endemic countries and trade restrictions in FMD-free countries. FMD is caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. FMDV occurs as seven distinct serotypes: A, O, C and Asia 1 and South African Territories (SAT) serotypes SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3. There is little or no cross-protection between serotypes and even between different strains of the same serotype (Brooksby, 1982; Paton et al., 2005 , OIE Terrestrial Manual, 2012 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 350, "end": 377, "text": "(Alexandersen et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 964, "end": 980, "text": "(Brooksby, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 981, "end": 999, "text": "Paton et al., 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1030, "text": ", OIE Terrestrial Manual, 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "FMD is characterized by vesicular lesions and ulcerations on the tongue, mouth, nasal region and coronary bands of infected animals (Alexandersen and Mowat, 2005) . The clinical signs of FMD are not pathognomonic. A number of viral diseases including vesicular stomatitis (VS), swine vesicular disease (SVD), idiopathic vesicular disease (IVD), vesicular exanthema of swine (VES), mucosal disease (MD) and papular stomatitis clinically mimic FMD. In addition, bacteria, chemicals and mechanical trauma also cause erosions and ulcerations in mouth and feet of pigs and ruminants. Therefore, laboratory confirmation is essential for identification of FMDV-infected animals. Current laboratory assays for FMDV detection include virus isolation, antigen ELISA and molecular assays [conventional and real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR)]. Virus isolation takes several days, is labour-intensive and can only be performed in specialized biocontainment facilities. Antigen ELISAs show limited sensitivity compared with molecular assays and also require skilled technicians to perform and interpret the assays. Conventional RT-PCR and RRT-PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific; however, sophisticated instrumentation, post-amplification sample/data analyses and skilled technicians are required (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Oem et al., 2005; Moniwa et al., 2007; Goris et al., 2009; Longjam et al., 2011; McKillen et al., 2011; Madi et al., 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 162, "text": "(Alexandersen and Mowat, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1308, "text": "(Rasmussen et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1326, "text": "Oem et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1347, "text": "Moniwa et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1367, "text": "Goris et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1389, "text": "Longjam et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1412, "text": "McKillen et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1431, "text": "Madi et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "FMD outbreaks have to be quickly detected and contained, and therefore, onsite detection tools are highly desirable.

To our knowledge, none of those assays are commercially available yet. Here we report laboratory validation of a commercially available TaqMan probe-based, field-deployable reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay for rapid detection of all FMDV serotypes. The assay was performed on a commercially available compact POCKIT TM Nucleic Acid Analyser (GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA, USA). The assay, POCKIT TM FMDV Reagent Set (GeneReach USA), is available as lyophilized single-tube reactions that can be performed on a field-deployable instrument, POCKIT TM Nucleic Acid Analyser (GeneReach USA). The POCKIT TM analyser is a relatively inexpensive (~US$ 5000.00) compared with currently available thermocyclers. It is a compact (28 9 25 9 8.5 cm), lightweight (~2.1 kg) and user-friendly instrument specially designed to perform PCR and RT-PCR assays based on Rayleigh-B enard convection (Chang et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2012; Balasuriya, 2014; Ambagala et al., 2017; Chua et al., 2016; Go et al., 2016) . It measures the fluorescence intensity of each sample once prior to and once after the PCR or RT-PCR amplification is complete, automatically calculates the ratio between initial and final fluorescence intensities or signal-to-noise ratio (R1) and therefore requires no data interpretation. If the R1 value is above the manufacturer's default threshold (1.3), a '+' result is displayed, and if it is below 1.2, a '\u00c0' result is displayed on the LED screen built into the machine. Rarely, a '?' result is displayed if the R1 value is equal to or between 1.2 and 1.3 (1.2 \u2264 R1 \u2264 1.3), indicating an unreliable result and this requires retesting the sample.

The RT-iiPCR was able to detect FMDV RNA in all RRT-PCR-positive clinical samples, and additionally in some (~14%) of the RRT-PCR-negative samples.

In this study, we demonstrated that the RT-iiPCR assay can detect FMDV RNA in intact vesicular fluid samples without RNA extraction process. The R1 values for all positive samples were 4.9 or 5, except for the 1 : 5 diluted vesicular fluid sample from pig # 81. The R1 value reduction observed (2.7) on this sample could be due to inhibitory effects of proteins in vesicular fluid on the RT-iiPCR assay. Similar observations were noted when undiluted serum samples were tested in the CSFV RT-iiPCR assay (Lung et al., 2015b) . For more complex samples, however, nucleic acid extraction is required to ascertain high sensitivity. Most of the nucleic acid extraction methods available to date are too elaborate, labour-intensive and require trained technicians to perform the procedure. Simplified column-based extraction systems are available and they can be used to isolate total nucleic acids from clinical samples in the field (Ambagala et al., 2017) , but still require a considerable amount of manual handling of the samples which can lead to potential contaminations and/or degradation of viral RNA.
