Therefore, meta-analyses 248 using Latin American cases would also be ideal for determining how COVID-19 could affect this 249 region, which has some differences, such as lower average age or higher exposure to respiratory 250 infections than other regions like Europe (Amariles et al., 2020a). A third meta-analysis was 251 found, which suggested that it could be possible to predict if a patient with COVID-19 can 252 present complications. Lagunas-Rangel (2020) hypothesized that complications are related to 253 high levels of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and low levels of lymphocyte-to-C-reactive 254 protein ratio (LCR).

For example, a Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction suggested that Wuhan 221 was effectively the outbreak epicenter on November 25, 2019, spreading later to other Chinese 222 regions (Benvenuto et al., 2020c). 223 Additionally, the geo-positioning of some cases and the heterogeneity of the outbreak progress 224 among countries, with demographic similarities, have been reported (de Figueiredo et al., 2020; 225 Xu et al., 2020). Other epidemiological studies have been done to predict the COVID-19 226 spreading (Benvenuto et al., 2020d; C\u00f3rdova-Lepe et al., 2020; Gonz\u00e1lez-Jaramillo et al., 2020; 227 Manrique-Abril et al., 2020), which concluded that containment strategies are required to avoid 228 overspreading in countries like Chile and Colombia. Similarly, Kraemer et al. (2020) analyzed 229 the effect of mobility in China before and after the sanitary containment of Wuhan in the 230 COVID-19 spreading in this country; they demonstrated that decreasing mobility favors the 231 reduction of COVID-19 spreading. 232 233 5.2. Meta-analyses performed 234 Latin American researchers have also published meta-analyses of clinical, laboratory, and image 235 data from reported COVID-19 cases (Borges do Nascimento et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Morales et 236 al., 2020b). On the one hand, the meta-analysis submitted by Rodriguez-Morales et al. (2020b) 237 on February 29, 2020, used 19 articles with 2,874 patients for quantitative analyses. On the other 238 hand, the meta-analysis of Borges do Nascimento et al. (2020), submitted six days later, 239 employed 61 studies with 59,254 patients.

The authors used some constraints in their search, 270 such as low cost, reduced time to reach markets, existing pharmaceutical supplies, or the 271 possibility to combine with other drugs. In total, 24 clinical trials were found, most of them in 272 clinical phases 2, 3, or 4, with a scheduled end in 2020. These ongoing clinical trials are using 273 chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, human immunoglobulin, remdesivir, arbidol, lopinavir, 274 ritonavir, oseltamivir, darunavir, cobicistat, interferons, carrimycin, danoprevir, xiyanping, 275 favipiravir, thalidomide, vitamin C, methylprednisolone, pirfenidone, bromhexie, bevacizumab, 276 fingolimod, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). 277 Similarly, Serafin et al.
