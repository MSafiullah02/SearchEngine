            "text": "One of the fundamental tasks in bioinformatics is sequence comparison, which is used heavily in database searching, sequence classification, phylogenetic tree reconstruction and detection of regulatory sequences. In most cases, alignments are performed between the target sequences by dynamic programming techniques and the resulting alignment scores are used to calculate a measure of similarity. Meanwhile, especially in recent years, an increasing number of alignment-free methods have emerged [1], [2], [3], [4]. In contrast to traditional alignments, these alignment-free methods mostly (i) make few assumptions of the evolutionary model and (ii) present light computational load. With the first merit, alignment-free methods do not suffer greatly from some evolutionary events, e.g., large rearrangements and transposon activity. While the second merit enables broad contributions of alignment-free comparisons in pre-filtering relevant sequences, and then using alignment algorithms to refine the searches. This type of heuristic approach is already used in programs like BLAST [5] and FASTA [6]. Additionally, after the completion of many genome projects, alignment-free comparisons begin to find their use in whole genome phylogeny, which meets great computational and theoretical challenges using alignment-based methods.",

Observing that relative abundances of all dinucleotides are remarkably constant across the genome, Karlin et al. [7], [8], [9] proposed the \u2018genome signature\u2019 to describe a genome. The \u2018signature\u2019 consists of the array of dinucleotide relative abundances \u03c1xy=fxy/fxfy extended over all dinucleotides, where fx is the frequency of nucleotide x and fxy is the frequency of dinucleotide xy. In the same manner, genome signature based on abundances of k-nucleotides can also be defined. Reinert et al. [10] studied the statistical and probabilistic properties of words in sequences, with emphasis on the deductions of exact distributions and evaluation of its asymptotic approximations. Word-based comparisons were recently reviewed by Vinga and Almeida [2]. According to their work, biological sequences are first represented as frequency vectors in Euclidean space, and then pairwise distances between these sequences can be defined as the standard Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, linear correlation coefficient or Kullback\u2013Leibler discrepancy between their corresponding vectors. As another powerful tool for sequence analysis, some graphical representations of DNA or protein sequences are also based on statistics of short words [11], [12].",

Occurrences of word \u03c9i in these two sequences are denoted by N1,\u03c9iandN2,\u03c9i, respectively. In the first step, we use S1 to estimate the Poisson parameter. Known that the parameter \u03bb of Poisson model is equal to the expectation of the variable (word occurrence, in our model), we intuitively set \u03bb=N1,\u03c9i. Then defineRP\u03c9i(S1,S2)=Poi(N2,\u03c9i;N1,\u03c9i)=(N1,\u03c9i)N2,\u03c9i\u00b7e-N1,\u03c9iN2,\u03c9i!,where Poi(k;\u03bb) is the Poisson probability with parameter \u03bb,(1)Poi(k;\u03bb)=\u03bbke-\u03bbk!.Actually, RP\u03c9i(S1,S2) measures a kind of \u2018similarity\u2019 between S1andS2 in terms of the occurrences of \u03c9i (note that it is not a strict similarity measure as it is not symmetrical). Explicitly, low values of RP\u03c9i correspond to the relatively large discrepancies in occurrences of the word \u03c9i, and the maximum value is gotten when N1,\u03c9i=N2,\u03c9iorN1,\u03c9i=N2,\u03c9i+1. Taking all words into consideration, the final distance between S1andS2 is defined(2)dRP(S1,S2)=\u2211i=1nk(RP\u03c9i(S1,S1)+RP\u03c9i(S2,S2)-RP\u03c9i(S1,S2)-RP\u03c9i(S2,S1)).Here the two terms RP\u03c9i(S1,S1)andRP\u03c9i(S2,S2) are introduced to guarantee the positivity of dRP(S1,S2) (note that RP\u03c9i(S1,S1)\u2a7eRP\u03c9i(S1,S2) for any word \u03c9i).",

In this part, the occurrences of word \u03c9i in sequences S1andS2 follow two different Poisson distributions (with parameters \u03bb1,iand\u03bb2,i, respectively). Define(3)Exp1,\u03c9i=\u2211k=0N1,\u03c9iPoi(k;\u03bb1,i),where N1,\u03c9i is the occurrence of \u03c9i in S1. Exp1,\u03c9i is the probability of observing \u2a7dN1,\u03c9i occurrences of \u03c9i in sequence S1. Note that a word is called highly expressed if its observed frequency is more than its expected frequency, and called low expressed otherwise. In this sense, the probability Exp1,\u03c9i measures a level of expression \u2013 low value of Exp1,\u03c9i corresponds to low expression of word \u03c91, and large value of Exp1,\u03c9i corresponds to high expression of the word \u03c91 in sequence S1. We define the final distance between S1andS2 as(4)dExp(S1,S2)=\u2211i=1nk|Exp1,\u03c9i-Exp2,\u03c9i|.Now, to compute dExp(S1,S2) we need to determine \u03bb1,iand\u03bb2,i for each word in each sequence. Note that the Poisson parameter for a word is actually its expected occurrence, which can be obtained immediately by multiplying the expected frequency (or background frequency) by the total number of words. We now only need to determine the background frequency of each word. To achieve this aim, two approaches are tried. The first approach corresponds to independence of nucleotides in the sequence, i.e., background frequency of the word \u03c9 is estimated by the product of the corresponding nucleotide frequencies in this sequence,(5)f\u00af\u03c9=f\u00af\u03b11\u03b12\u22ef\u03b1k=f\u03b11f\u03b12\u22eff\u03b1k,where f\u03b1i(i=1,2,\u2026,k) is the frequency of the letter \u03b1i in this sequence. An alternative method for estimating the background frequency of a word was proposed by Qi et al. [16], who applied a Markov model of DNA sequences of order k-2. The expected frequency of a word is predicted from the probabilities of appropriate shorter subwords(6)f\u00af\u03c9=f\u00af\u03b11\u03b12\u22ef\u03b1k=f\u03b11\u03b12\u22ef\u03b1k-1\u00b7f\u03b12\u03b13\u22ef\u03b1kf\u03b12\u03b13\u22ef\u03b1k-1,where f\u03b11\u03b12\u22ef\u03b1k-1 is the frequency of the (k-1)-word \u03b11\u03b12\u22ef\u03b1k-1 in the corresponding sequence. Then for each background probability estimated by Eqs. (5), (6), the corresponding Poisson parameter is\u03bb\u03c9=f\u00af\u03c9\u00b7(l-k+1).The distance dExp has the following properties: (i) dExp(S1,S2)\u2a7e0anddExp(S1,S1)=0, for any sequences S1andS2; (ii) background information (or frequencies of shorter words) is incorporated into the measurement; and (iii) words with identical frequency and occurrence in two sequences may contribute to dExp, i.e., they may have different background frequencies and expression levels.",

In order to validate our method, distance matrices for the same data set are also constructed using some classical dissimilarity measurements, e.g., the standard Euclidean distance [15], [25], linear correlation coefficient [26], Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) discrepancy [3] and the Composition Vector approach [16], [27]. Note that the Kullback\u2013Leibler discrepancy between two frequency vectors is not symmetrical and will give degenerate results when some word types are absent, we use a revised version \u2013 the Weighted Sequence Entropy (WSE) [28]. This modification works equivalently with the KL discrepancy in the case of short words, and can effectively avoid the degeneracy for long words. The string Composition Vector (CV) approach proposed by Hao\u2019s group is a fast and efficient approach to whole genome comparison and phylogenetic analysis.

Then, rooted phylogenetic trees are drawn by the TREEVIEW program [29]. The UPGMA tree built by the standard Euclidean distance is shown as Fig. 1\n(1). This tree supports torovirus as the outgroup of all coronaviruses, but fails to cluster three group I coronaviruses \u2013 HCoV-229E and PEDV are grouped together, but TGEV is much closer to the SARS clade. Fig. 1(2) is the NJ tree constructed by the Euclidean distance. Similar to the UPGMA tree, this tree also prefers SARS-CoVs clustering with TGEV. But an obvious defect is that it does not successfully cluster the eight group II coronaviruses. In Fig. 2\n, we list the trees built by linear correlation coefficient between pairwise frequency vectors. Fig. 2(1) is the UPGMA tree. This tree perfectly clusters species within each typical group, and confirmed SARS-CoVs paraphyly. But it fails to identify the outgroup status of torovirus relative to coronaviruses. While the NJ tree (Fig. 2(2)), in which torovirus is selected as outgroup species, confirms the adjacent relationship of SARS-CoVs with group I viruses. In the tree built from our distance measure dExp (Fig. 3\n), all above defects are eliminated, i.e., species of each typical groups cluster, and torovirus stays outside of all coronaviruses including SARS-CoVs. Our tree shows that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any previously isolated coronaviruses and form a new group, but do not support the outgroup status of SARS-CoVs relative to other coronaviruses, as proposed by Zheng et al. [30]. This result is mainly in accordance with the WSE tree at word order k=6 (Fig. 4\n) and the NJ tree constructed by the Composition Vector method (Fig. 5\n). Moreover, it is also supported by the experimental evidence, which showed that group I coronaviruses specific antibodies are able to recognize antigens in SARS-CoV infected cultured cells [31].",

This topology is in perfect agreement with that given by Otu and Sayood except for the position of rodents (mouse and rat). However, the relationship among the three main groups of placental mammals is still a controversial topic in molecular genetics [33]. Different types of molecular data and analysis methods result in different trees. By the maximum likelihood method, some proteins support the Ferungulates (Primates, Rodents) grouping while other proteins support the Rodents (Ferungulates, Primates) grouping [34]. Whereas our result suggests an alternative topology of Primates (Ferungulates, Rodents).

It has relatively low computational complexity, and does not suffer greatly from genetic rearrangements and transposon activity, which serve as common ways of genome evolution. In most cases, biological sequences are represented as occurrence or frequency vectors in a high dimensional Euclidean space, and then the standard Euclidean distance, linear correlation coefficient, Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) discrepancy or cosine function between these vectors are calculated as measures of dissimilarity. In this paper, we investigate two word-based distance measurements in a probabilistic framework. Our hypothesis is that occurrence of a given word in a random DNA sequence follows the Poisson distribution. Then distance between two sequences is evaluated by the probability of generating one sequence under the Poisson model estimated from the other, or their different expression levels of words. In contrast to the traditional word-based distances, which use only frequencies of fixed-length words, our distances take background information of words (estimated by frequencies of some shorter words or the corresponding nucleotide composition) into account. In other words, our method has a potential to adjust the background information for distance measurements using composition vector. Through constructing phylogenetic trees of 25 viruses including SARS-CoVs and 20 Eutherian mammals, we find that our method gives a more competitive result compared to the ongoing word-based methods.",

So a reliable and efficient approximation of Poisson probability is critical to our method. In addition, the accuracy of our approach depends strongly on the Poisson model of word occurrences. This assumption is generally valid when the sequence length is sufficiently large. But for words with overlapping structure, e.g., TATATA and CCGCCG, their occurrences in a random sequence may vary significantly from the Poisson distribution. While at the same time, experiments showed that these self-overlapping words are more prone to be functional patterns in regular regions of genomes. In the future study, we will explore some models to describe and compare these words.",
