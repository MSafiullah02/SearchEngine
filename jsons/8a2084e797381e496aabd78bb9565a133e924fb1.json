Efferocytosis is an equilibrium formed by perfect coordination among \"find-me\", \"eat-me\" and \"don't-eat-me\" signals. These signaling pathways not only affect the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of tumor cells but also regulate adaptive responses and drug resistance to antitumor therapies. Therefore, efferocytosis-related molecules and pathways are potential targets for antitumor therapy. Besides, supplementing conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other immunotherapies with efferocytosis-targeted therapy could enhance the therapeutic efficacy, reduce off-target toxicity, and promote patient outcome.",

During apoptosis, phagocytes rapidly recognize and engulf dying cells before intracellular components are released. Subsequently, the membrane integrity of apoptotic cells is maintained, hence avoiding the exposure of immunogenic materials and the subsequent inflammatory responses [2] . This physiologic process, referred to as efferocytosis, efficiently removes apoptotic cells without subsequent secondary necrosis and damages [3] . Efferocytosis is induced by several physiological or pathological conditions and plays a crucial role in tissue differentiation, repair, and the resolution of inflammation [4] . Because of the pleiotropic role of efferocytosis, disruption and dysregulation of this process are associated with many pathological states, which may trigger some diseases. Previous research has linked efferocytosis to inflammatory diseases [5] , autoimmune diseases [6] and atherosclerosis [7, 8] .",

Recent studies have demonstrated the vital role of efferocytosis in the tumor microenvironment, progression, and metastasis of tumors [15, 16] . Following engulfment, tumor-associated macrophages increase the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg cells (regulatory T cells), while inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector T cells [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, the immunologically silent clearance of apoptotic cells promotes inflammation resolution and immune suppression, which provide cancer cells with an environment to escape from immunological surveillance hence promoting tumor progression [1, 20] . This review explores the function and underlying mechanisms of efferocytosis in tumor progression and summarizes the promising targets and novel strategies for cancer therapy.",

            "text": "Recognition Efferocytosis includes complicated and coordinated molecular communication and involves several signaling pathways that culminate in phagocytosis and clearance of dying cells. The first step in efferocytosis is recognition of the targeted apoptotic cells by phagocytes through \"find-me\" signals such as lipids, proteins, peptides, and complex structures released by dying cells [21] . These signals act as chemo-attractants for scavenger cells recruited to the apoptotic site during the early stages of efferocytosis. The first chemotactic factor to be identified as a \"find-me\" signal was a covalent dimer of the ribosomal protein S19 [22] . Lysophosphatidylcholine is a lipid attraction signal produced by apoptotic cells through caspase-3 mediated activation of the calciumindependent phospholipase A2 and stimulates the migration of monocytes and primary macrophages [23, 24] . Also, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is another lipid chemotactic factor that acts as a \"find-me\" signal in efferocytosis. S1P triggers the chemotaxis of macrophages to engulf apoptotic cells [25] . As a member of the chemokine family, CX3CL1 is also a \"find-me\" signal released by lymphocytes after apoptosis and attracts macrophages to the apoptotic site [26] . Elliott et al. demonstrated the role of extracellular nucleotides in phagocytosis and apoptotic cell recognition, as the release of ATP and UTP from apoptotic cells elicit an attraction signal through their receptor P2Y 2 on phagocytes [27] .",

Alternatively, PS can indirectly bind to receptors on phagocytes via bridging molecules. For example, TAM receptors are a type of indirect PS receptors, and growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) and Protein S are bridging molecules that facilitate the binding of PS on apoptotic cells to TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl and MerTK) on phagocytes [37] . Further, Gas 6 binds to all three receptors, while Protein S only binds to Tyro3 and MerTK [38] . Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-8 (MFG-E8) bridges between PS and \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 /\u03b1 v \u03b2 5 integrins, another type of indirect PS receptors [39] . Besides, the SCARF1 scavenger receptor on phagocytes uses C1q as a complement component to recognize PS on apoptotic cells [40] . Inversely, phagocytes can identify live and normal cells by detecting \"don't-eat-me\" signals, which protects the cells from being engulfed. The most widely studied ligands of \"don't-eat-me\" signals are CD47 [4] and CD31 [41] .",

This process is accompanied by the secretion of a series of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2), interleukin (IL)-10, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and platelet-activating factor (PAF). Meanwhile, the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-12 is inhibited [42, 43] . This mechanism occurs via the reduction of M1 macrophage induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppression of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u0138B) signaling [44] . In contrast, the anti-inflammatory response of M2 macrophages is enhanced [45] . Besides, TAM receptor activation dampens pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by upregulating the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and SOCS3. Furthermore, the enhancement of efferocytosis is always in line with the decreased activation and function of CD8 + and CD4 + effector T cells as well as increased Treg cellsmediated immunosuppression [17, [46] [47] [48] [49] . Indeed, CD8 + and CD4 + T cells play a critical role in tumor rejection response [50] . Particularly, CD8 + cytotoxic T cells are acknowledged to recognize tumor-specific antigens and target cancer cells, leading to the shrinkage of tumor [51] .",

            "text": "TAM receptors promote the tumor microenvironment by promoting remodeling of the extracellular matrix and the release of factors conducive to cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis [53] . Under normal physiological conditions, TAM receptors are principally expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and antigenpresenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells [54] . However, TAM receptors are overexpressed in various cancers, including lung cancer, leukemia, gastrointestinal cancer, and breast cancer, and the overexpression results in enhanced efferocytosis and a worse cancer outcome [55] [56] [57] . The underlying mechanisms of TAM receptors, particularly Axl and MerTK, have been widely researched. The oncogenic and cancer-promoting mechanisms of MerTK are associated with the classic cell proliferation pathways phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/proteinserine-threonine kinase (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [55] . Through the PI3K/Akt signaling axis, MerTK induces polarization of M2 macrophages while inhibiting polarization of M1 macrophages, and thereby resulting in the resolution of inflammation [58] . M2 macrophages play a crucial role in the cancer microenvironment by facilitating tumor progression and invasion due to their immunosuppressive characteristics [59] . In addition to innate immunity, MerTK is involved in the modulation in adaptive immunity as genetic ablation of MerTK parallels increased intratumoral CD8 + T lymphocytes and promoted lymphocyte proliferation [48] . Moreover, MerTK-driven efferocytosis also induces the expression of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a molecule that promotes tumor escape, and therefore enhances the immune suppression microenvironment for cancer cells [57] . Notably, MerTK is essential for TIM-4 induced efferocytosis [60] . Since TIM-4 lacks an extensive intracellular domain, it works in tandem with MerTK to facilitate the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [60] . Furthermore, it has been shown in many malignant tumors that MerTK is involved in the resistance of multiple anticancer therapies. In non-small cell lung cancer, for instance, MerTK participates in drugresistance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors [61] .",

The Gas6/Axl signaling pathway influences cancer development and progression through its effect on tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis [38, 63, 64] . A previous study demonstrated that Axl is required for EMT, which promotes metastasis of HER-2 positive breast cancer [65] . Several signaling pathways, including Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), PI3K/Akt, and NF-\u0138B, MAPK/ERK are downstream of the Gas6/Axl pathway [66] . Therefore, macrophage polarization induced by the PI3K/Akt signaling axis is also involved in the cancer-promoting mechanisms of Axl. Moreover, Axl could mediate resistance to chemotherapy [67] , radiotherapy, and targeted molecular therapy in many cancers [68] . For instance, overexpression of Axl promotes resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) through the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways [69] . In small-cell lung cancer, Axl promotes primary and acquired resistance to WEE1 (WEE1 G2 checkpoint kinase) inhibition. This resistance occurs via activation of another G2-checkpoint protein, the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which is a parallel pathway for the repair of DNA damage [70] .",

This blockage triggers a pro-inflammatory response, increases the immunogenicity of apoptotic tumor cells, and shifts the immunosuppressive environment towards an antitumor response [20, 88, 89] . PS targeting antibodies specifically bind to PS with high affinity. As PS is also expressed in vascular endothelial cells, these antibodies not only target PS-expressing tumors but also target tumor blood vessels [90, 104, 105] . The interaction between PS targeting antibodies and exposed PS increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines and reduces the expression of immunosuppressive myeloidderived suppressor cells [106] . Besides, PS targeting antibodies induce the polarization of M1 macrophages and recruitment of mature dendritic cells, leading to an increase of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells [106] . When Abbreviations: PS, phosphatidylserine; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor; MFG-E8, Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-8; CD, cluster of differentiation; Gas, growth arrest-specific protein 6; ICAM-1, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1; HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1 used in combination with either chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immune checkpoint antibodies (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1), PS targeting agents have been shown to facilitate the curative effect of these therapies [20, 88] . As such, pre-clinical agents associated with PS targeting antibodies such as Annexin A5 of annexin proteins and 3G4, 2aG4 and chimeric 1 N11 have been developed [20] . Multiple clinical trials of bavituximab, a PS targeting antibody, have also been carried out [107] [108] [109] . However, subsequent phase II study and phase III trial did not provide evidence on the substantial improvement of efficacy following the addition of bavituximab compared to the chemotherapy alone group [54, 110] . Besides efferocytosis, PS targeting therapy also interferes with the function of antigen-presenting cell (APCs) and induces non-selective inhibition of all PS-dependent phagocytic activity. Thus, PS inhibition may cause other harmful side effects on the body [54] . Notably, PS receptor-blocking approaches also inhibit PS signaling pathway.",

There are currently five types of Axl targeting agents under development. These agents include small-molecule TKIs, nucleotide aptamers, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), soluble receptors, and several natural compounds [38] . Research on reputable Axl inhibitors, especially the TKIs, has now progressed into clinical trial phases [38] . Nonetheless, Axl TKIs have increased clinical off-target toxicity and drug resistance [93, 94] . Nucleotide aptamers and mAbs are emerging therapy with higher affinity and specificity, and lower toxicity and drug resistance [91, 95, 114, 115] , although their application is currently at preclinical stages [38] . Other than the transmembrane form, Axl can also exist in a soluble form once it is cleaved in the extracellular domain. Soluble Axl binds to Gas6 or Axl itself, thereby inhibiting the transmembrane Axl and Gas6 signaling pathway [116] . Besides, it has been shown that natural compounds such as celastrol [117] and dihydroartemisinin [118] show therapeutic potential through Axl inhibition.",

Several preclinical studies have reported similar adaptive responses caused by single TKI therapy, and co-targeting of the receptor tyrosine kinase family could, therefore, be a novel strategy for overcoming drug resistance and increasing efficacy [61, [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] .

Previous studies have demonstrated that the down-regulation of MFG-E8 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to TKIs and cytotoxic agents in vitro [98, 126] . Besides, the combination of chemotherapy and MFG-E8 RNA interference contributes to sustained inhibition of tumor survival and growth [97] . These synergistic actions could be attributed to several mechanisms since the down-regulation of MFG-E8 signaling results in several different effects, including (1) decrease in chemotherapy resistance of tumor cells; (2) inhibition of MFG-E8mediated efferocytosis; (3) blockage of VEGF-induced angiogenesis; (4) enhanced cross-presentation between the dying tumor cells and dendritic cells; (5) reduced Treg cells and increased activation and function of CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells [17, 97, 127, 128] . Indeed, MFG-E8 bridges between PS exposed on apoptotic cells and \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 /\u03b1 v \u03b2 5 integrins expressed on macrophages [39, 129] . Therefore, integrin-targeted molecules such as extracellular matrix ligands, high-mobility group box 1, and inhibitory antibodies also suppress efferocytosis [99, 130] .",

In addition, anti-CD47 mAbs decrease the ability of Treg cells to overcome immune evasion by cancer cells and increase the capacity of CD8 + T cells to exhibit an effective antitumor cytotoxic function [49] . Furthermore, anti-CD47 mAbs prevent or eliminate metastatic lesions and circulating tumor cells [135, 136] . Consequently, the blockade of CD47 signals inhibits the growth and metastasis of human tumors [134] . Since CD47 is also expressed on normal cells at varying levels, looming safety concerns on targeting CD47 should be addressed [100] . Previous studies have revealed that anti-CD47 mAbs could produce potent antitumor responses without causing any severe side effects, even at doses that exceed the minimum effective dose. This observation could be attributed to the lack of secondary prophagocytic \"eat-me\" signals on the surface of healthy cells [101, 134] . Under cellular stress, however, the calreticulin of healthy cells may translocate to the cell surface and result in phagocytosis of healthy cells by nearby macrophages. Thus, targeting CD47 should be applied with caution in the context of recent ongoing inflammatory or cytotoxic treatments [137, 138] . The findings of a study by Willingham et al. point out that a better efficacy of anti-CD47 mAbs therapy is correlated with smaller tumor size at the onset of treatment. The study further proposes that the optimal time to effect an anti-CD47 therapy is after maximal cytoreductive surgery [134] .",

ICAM-1 is also expressed on the cell surface of many cancer types and facilitates tumor progression and metastasis [143] . ICAM-1 inhibits the efferocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and the downregulation of efferocytosis leads to the decrease of M2 macrophage polarization, consequently inhibiting tumor progression and tumor metastasis [143, 144] . Therefore, the role of ICAM-1 in efferocytosis makes it a promising target for cancer treatment. Other agents that alter the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages are also of therapeutic potential.",

In the study, inhibition of efferocytosis did not suppress the production of tumor myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Treg cells, and some immunosuppressive mediators. Further research uncovered that this phenomenon could be because decreased efferocytosis induced secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, which stimulated the expression of inflammation-resolving factor indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1, leading to the restoration of the immunosuppressive environment for cancer cells. The results indicate that apoptotic and necrotic cancer cells promote tumor progression through efferocytosis and IDO1 respectively. Combined inhibition of these two processes showed a better result in tumor regression and inhibition of metastasis [52] .",

Among the three signals, the \"find-me\" signals do not exhibit specificity for antitumor targeting, and many studies have, therefore, focused on the \"eat-me\" and \"don't-eatme\" signals. These signaling pathways influence cancer development and progression by affecting the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells, epithelialmesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis.

Combining these traditional therapies with efferocytosis-targeted therapy could, therefore, enhance the efficacy and promote patient outcomes. Single TKI therapy also elicits adaptive responses and drug resistance, and co-targeting receptors of the tyrosine kinase family are promising for overcoming TKI-related drug resistance and increasing treatment efficacy. Also, the combined therapies could result in reduced side effects. However, the mechanisms underlying efferocytosis are obscure; for instance, the Tyro3 pathway has not been extensively explored. Besides, no compelling evidence on the efficacy of several efferocytosis inhibitors such as bavituximab has been established, and the potential clinical off-target toxicity may limit the clinical application. Furthermore, the safety of some efferocytosis-associated including MerTK inhibitors and anti-CD47 mAbs needs to be further studied. ",
