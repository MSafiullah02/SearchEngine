COVID-19 infection lead to respiratory illness and has sign like flu, fever, cough, myalgia, diarrhea, and dyspnea [3]. It is a highly contagious and is transmitted via bodily contacts and a respiratory bead from the infected patients, which is now the main source of transmission of the disease. The existence duration for the virus can be up to 12 hours or even two days on a contacted surface [4]. The fatality rate is higher among the young children and elderly aged group \u2265 60 years [5].",

For patients, all body fluids and electrolytes should be continuously checked with vital signs and to avoid further spread, they should be incubated with strict clinical measures under preventive guidelines [8]\n. The government need to find a strategy to fight this war in timely fashion, such as authorities took further measures of closing borders, suspending community services and schools, minimizing both domestic and international travels until further notice [9]\n. The purpose of these measures is to limit the chances of physical contacts among people, so that transmission of COVID-19 is controlled, as the incubation period for this virus is relatively longer than other viruses.",

Therefore, short term forecasting is extremely important even in the slightest hint for predicting the upcoming month for the better management of the societal, economical, cultural and public health issues [10]. In the past few months researchers have developed or employed existing mathematical and statistical methods to predict the number of COVID-19 cases and related outcomes. Fractional time delay dynamic system (FTDD) reflects good forecast agreements to the public data [11]. Generalized logistic model (GLM) indicates that the epidemic growth was exponential in china [12]. Based on prediction, situation will be worsened in entire Europe and USA will become the epicenter of new cases during mid of April 2020 [13]. Around 2 million people will be infected by the beginning of May if no measures are taken [14]. Predictions/estimates help to strengthen the strategies in order to prevent the pandemic from worsening. In this research study, we used the available data to forecast the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries in Pakistan for upcoming month. This forecasting is aimed to help government institutions and policy makers as well as public in adopting new strategies and strengthening the existing preventive measures against COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this study may help in reliving current socioeconomic and psychosocial distress caused by COVID-19 among public in Pakistan.",

As a result, Cumulative data is used to predict the number of cases in Pakistan. The cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries are expected to show exponential growth over time. Therefore, we used the simple time series methods of Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model [16] to forecast the number of cases, deaths and recoveries for upcoming month. The ARIMA model has higher fitting and forecasting accuracy than exponential smoothing [17]. It captures both the seasonal and non-seasonal forecasting trends. Due to the limited available data, we simply focus on non-seasonal models to describes the pattern (growth) over time. Hence, we assumed that the pattern of current cases will continue in the near future (at least a month). We believe that the ARIMA model, which is the combination of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) fits well to the nature of the available data and provide good forecasting for the short time series data. The forecasting and prediction intervals until the end of May is produced from the fitted model. In order to assess the model fit, parameters (p, d, q) are identified by Autocorrelation function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation function (PACF); whereas, p is the autoregressive term, d is the differencing order and q is the moving averages term. Furthermore, ARIMA (p, d, q) results are based upon Akaike information criterion (AIC) which is a goodness of fit test such that model with minimum AIC is considered best. All statistical analyses were conducted using the R-library \u201cforecast, tseries and zoo\u201d [18] developed for fitting ARIMA model.",

Therefore, double differencing is used, in order to stabilize (made stationary) the data by removing trends.

Results from the model revealed that the number of confirmed cases show a rapid exponential growth which may increase by 2.7 times compared to current cases until end of May 2020. The 95% prediction interval for confirmed cases is from 5681 to 33079 which are at much higher growth, Figure 2\n. The results from the forecasting model for deaths revealed that deaths may be increased up to 500 at the end of May if the current mortality rate prevails. The 95% prediction interval for mortality is estimated to be 168 to 885, Figure 3\n. Similarly, the forecast model for recoveries showed an exponential growth.

Currently, the number of deaths is quite low in Pakistan but results from the model revealed that it may increase up to 500 at the end of May. On the other hand, recoveries from COVID-19 related complications were slow in the beginning, but it is now increasing exponentially and the forecasting model for it shows that there could be eightfold increase in the number of recoveries.

It is important to note that majority of the research studies are modeling the preparedness scenarios to inform planning rather predictions [20], that is they informed the actions to be taken to slow the spread and prepare the health system to respond to the pandemic. In addition, their analysis has focused on countries in the South East Asia and Western Pacific regions and ignored other countries such as Pakistan [20] situated in the neighbor of China.",

It has formulated/taken drastic precautionary measures to contain COVID-19 including [21] establishing the National Coordination Committee for Covid-19 and National Disaster Management Authority [22], closure of all educational institutions, sealing borders with neighboring countries, travel bane and screening of travelers, social distancing and bane on public gathering, and comprehensive food security. These precautionary measures seem to be working well in the containment of COVID-19 as compared to other nations data worldwide [23,24,25]. Yet, the results of this study suggest an increasing trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths for the upcoming month and we recommend continuation of the above or more stringent measures to contain COVID-19. We believe that the forecasts established by this study is useful for Pakistani government and public in making informed decisions and taking appropriate steps to prevent further spread of COVID-19 disease.",

We used conventual statistical approaches AIC [27] for model assessment and selection.
