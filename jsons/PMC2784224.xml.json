The 30 known species are divided into two families: the Avsunviroidae have branched lowest free energy forms, replicate in chloroplasts using the phage-like chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and self-process multimeric replication products to their mature monomeric circular form. In contrast, members of the Pospiviroidae assume an unbranched, rod-shaped structure stabilized by a high degree of intramolecular base pairing as their most stable form, and lack ribozyme activity. The Pospiviroidae use DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II to replicate in the nucleus by a rolling circle mechanism that produces multimeric complementary strands that are templates for the synthesis of multimeric infectious strands [26]. The multimeric replicative forms are processed by as yet unidentified type III RNase into monomers with 5\u2032-phosphomonoester and 3\u2032-hydroxyl ends [27]. The processed ends are then ligated by an unidentified T4 RNA ligase-type enzyme to produce the mature circular form, which transits between cells in the absence of a protective capsid.",

            "text": "Members of the Pospiviroidae share high homology in the central portion of their rod-shaped structure, which is known as the central conserved region (CCR). Within the CCR of the rod-shaped structure is an interior loop with high sequence and structural similarity to 5S rRNA loop E that is highly susceptible to inter-strand cross-linking. Processing of multimeric infectious strands occurs within the CCR, one base pair away from the loop E-type element [28]. Riesner et al. discovered that the form of Pospiviroidae member Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) that is processed by nuclear extracts in vitro is not susceptible to cross-linking and thus lacks the loop E element, suggesting that the highly stable rod-shaped structure is not active for viroid processing [29]. The structure that was a substrate for processing was metastable, forming when in vitro synthesized RNA was heated and rapidly renaturated (snap-cooled) in a low ionic strength buffer [30]. Biochemical structure mapping of an actively processed form of PSTVd with a 17 nt duplication of the CCR suggested that the alternative, metastable conformation contains a hairpin capped by a GNRA tetraloop that is conserved in many members of the Pospiviroidae. A model was proposed suggesting that synthesis of viroid multimers during replication in the nucleus allows assumption of the metastable form that is stabilized by nuclear proteins. The first cleavage needed to process the multimer and release monomers was proposed to cause a conformational transition to the more stable loop E containing rod-shaped form, which was thought to be the substrate for the second cleavage and final ligation events [28]. A miniature version of PSTVd (148 nt) containing the CCR, a 17 nt CCR duplication, and short flanking regions capped by tetraloops was also correctly processed in nuclear extracts, indicating that the remainder of the viroid is not required for processing [31].",

The in vivo mapped processing sites were equivalent to the site mapped in PSTVd in vitro, but mutagenesis suggested that the tetraloop-capped hairpin either did not form or was not important for viroid maturation. Instead, maintenance of a metastable structure originally proposed by Diener [33] containing a double-stranded region joining branched monomeric units was critical for processing to the mature single viroid circular form (Fig. 1\n). This metastable structure is phylogenetically conserved throughout the Pospiviroidae.",

The program functions in parallel on populations representing thousands of possible RNA structures and can predict H-type pseudoknots. Populations of RNA assume distinct, transiently stable conformations representing possible functional metastable structures that can be visualized during the process. The Stem trace component of STRUCTURELAB also allows visualization of identical substructures that form within the population [35]. MPGAfold predicted that the CCR of PSTVd dimers transiently assumes the double-stranded structure with the remainder of the molecule assuming first a metastable branched configuration and then the stable rod-shaped structure. MPGAfold also predicted that PSTVd circular monomers form a branched intermediate structure that fits the biochemical mapping data [36].",

The stable rod-shaped structure is likely more resistant to cellular RNases and extracellular conditions encountered during capsid-free intercellular transit. This form, however, may not have the structural landscape required for specific interactions with cellular enzymes needed to complete the replication cycle. By incorporating the ability to shift between structures, viroids in the Pospiviroidae have the capacity to infect in the absence of a need to generate protective structural proteins, which may have enhanced the rate of systemic spread within a host.",

While an appropriate base-paired region exists and is a substrate for editing in the rod-shaped form of HDV genotype I [48], sequence differences between genotype members cause disrupted base pairing in the vicinity of the amber/W site in genotype III (Fig. 2\n; [50]). Using either full length or miniature versions of HDV genotype III, editing was determined to require an alternative, metastable double-hairpin branched structure with 80 nt structurally rearranged compared with the more stable rod form [50], [52]. The metastable structure contains two extensive hairpins linked by a central base-paired stem, with the edited adenylate at the base of one hairpin within the linked region. The alternative structure only forms during replication as a minor portion of a population that is dominated by the more stable rod-shaped form [53], thus limiting the extent of editing.",

For genotype I, which requires the rod-shaped structure for editing [48], enhancing the stability of the rod-shaped structure in a region near the edited site increased the efficiency of editing, suggesting that the editing site in genotype I is in a suboptimal configuration [53], [54]. In addition, S-HDAg binds to HDV genotype I RNA, which inhibits editing at the amber/W site and prevents rapid accumulation of edited RNA early in the replication cycle [47]. In contrast, editing of HDV genotype III is insensitive to the level of S-HDAg but is affected by binding of L-HDAg [55]. This results in feedback inhibition by the editing product, which decreases the availability of edited transcripts.",

The Peruvian isolate edited 3 times more efficiently in vitro than the Ecuadorian isolate, while in vivo, the opposite was true. MPGAfold revealed that differences in their free energy folding landscapes affected relative abilities to form the active branched structure. The Peruvian HDV was significantly less likely to form the productive branched structure due to enhanced stability of the rod-shaped structure and was also more likely to adopt unproductive alternative branched structures. Synthesis of transcripts by T7 RNA polymerase under conditions that reduced the rate of transcription to more accurately simulate the rate of HDV transcription in cells confirmed the population structural predictions by finding more branched structures in the Ecuadorian isolate population. These results suggested that levels of edited genotype III HDV are controlled by both the fraction of RNA that assumes the productive metastable branched structure and the efficiency with which ADAR1 edits the branched RNA [56].",

This pseudoknot signature was conserved in group 1 and 2 coronaviruses, and mutations that disrupted the pseudoknot reduced replication of a BCoV-derived defective interfering RNA (DI RNA) replicon [61]. Compensatory mutations between the pseudoknot partner residues restored infectivity, although some of the replicating DI RNAs restored the wild-type pseudoknot sequence through recombination with the helper BCoV genomic RNA.

The authors proposed that viral proteins including nsp8 and nsp9 bind to these elements causing a conformational shift that releases the 3\u2032 end\u2013loop 1 interaction and disrupts base pairing in the lower stem of the bulged stem structure, causing formation of the pseudoknot (Fig. 3). This alternative conformation is proposed to contain the proper structures and proteins for attracting the viral RdRp and associated factors to the template allowing minus-strand synthesis to proceed. Assays that only measure initiation of minus-strand synthesis do not require that the virus contain the region with the bulged stem\u2013loop/pseudoknot structure [67], since the replication-active alternative structure should form in the absence of the controlling region. Only group 2 coronaviruses contain both the bulge stem\u2013loop and pseudoknot structures, suggesting that group 1 and 3 viruses must have developed alternative means to regulate the same function. Although host proteins have been found that interact with the coronavirus 3\u2032 UTR, none of these proteins targets the region of the switch [60].",

Equine arteritis virus (EAV) contains two stem\u2013loop structures (SL4 and SL5) that control initiation of minus-strand synthesis [68], [69]. The 43-nt SL5 is located in the 3\u2032 UTR and the 14-nt SL4 is located at the 3\u2032 terminus of the upstream nucleocapsid (N) protein ORF. Revertants arising from EAV containing disabling SL5 mutations had second site mutations in SL4, leading to the discovery of a 10 base, two gap pseudoknot interaction between the two hairpins that disrupts the structure of SL4. Compensatory alterations between the two stem\u2013loops restored low to moderate levels of virus accumulation. Similar pseudoknot interactions that would disrupt one or both of the stem\u2013loop structures were possible in all known arteriviruses, although the biological process that requires alternative RNA structures in this region remains unknown.",

            "text": "\nTurnip crinkle virus (TCV) and other members of the Carmovirus genus in the family Tombusviridae are among the smallest of the plus-strand RNA viruses. Besides the single genomic RNA, TCV can be associated with non-coding subviral RNAs known as satellite (sat) RNAs, one of which (satC) is partially derived from the TCV genome [70], [71]. Most of the 15 carmoviruses share less than 50% sequence similarity, with little or no conservation in regions important for critical replication/translation functions such as 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. However, carmoviruses share the capacity to fold into several distinctive structures at their 3\u2032 ends with important roles in replication either demonstrated or predicted (Fig. 4\n). TCV and all carmoviruses with the exception of Galinsoga mosaic virus contain a very stable 3\u2032 terminal hairpin (Pr) tentatively identified as the core promoter for minus-strand synthesis based on analysis of the comparable hairpin in satC [72]. Directly upstream of all carmoviral Pr hairpins is a structurally conserved and critically important hairpin (H5), which contains a large symmetrical internal loop composed of phylogenetically conserved sequences [73]. The 3\u2032 side of the H5 internal loop forms an RNA:RNA interaction with bases at the 3\u2032 terminus (termed \u03a81), which is important for efficient TCV accumulation in vivo [74] and is present throughout the Tombusviridae (Fig. 2; [75]). TCV and the most related carmovirus, Cardamine chlorotic fleck virus (CCFV; 65% nt identity), have two juxtaposed hairpins just upstream of H5 (H4a/H4b), involved in two additional pseudoknots (\u03a82, \u03a83). Adjacent to these elements is another conserved hairpin, H4, which is important for both replication and translation ([76]; X. Yuan and A.E. Simon, unpublished), which forms a fourth pseudoknot (\u03a84) with the 5\u2032 side of the H5 large symmetrical loop (X. Yuan and A.E. Simon, unpublished).",

Mutations that disrupted \u03a81 and freed the 3\u2032 terminus enhanced transcription of satC transcripts by purified TCV recombinant RdRp in vitro, while compensatory alterations that restored the pseudoknot reduced transcription to wild-type levels.

The possibility that these transcripts synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase had formed non-productive, kinetically-trapped intermediates was ruled out by folding the RNA using different mono/divalent ion concentrations and different heating/cooling treatments and finding that the population of RNAs always adopted a single, stable configuration [82]. This initial conformation, termed the \u201cpre-active\u201d structure, also contained an important pseudoknot (\u03a82) that forms between the terminal loop of hairpin H4b and sequence flanking H5 in satC (Fig. 4; [80], [82]) and TCV [76] and is conserved in many carmoviruses [80]. The presence of \u03a82 in the initial structure adopted by satC transcripts and the formation of \u03a81 during the process that leads to minus-strand synthesis in vitro [73] strongly suggested that the pre-active satC structure was a functional alternative to the phylogenetically conserved, multiple hairpin structure.",

These findings led to the hypothesis that satC initially adopts the pre-active structure and requires a conformational shift to an active structure for transcription in vitro and in vivo. Altering the H4a-flanking sequence, known as the \u201cDR\u201d, decreased satC accumulation in vivo and substantially reduced transcription in vitro, indicating that this region is critical for initiation of minus-strand synthesis. However, mutations in the DR lost some or all of their inhibitory effects when combined with alterations that either shifted the structure to the active form in vitro, or stabilized active structure hairpins in vivo [80], [82]. The suggestion was made that the DR was necessary for the switch from the pre-active to the active conformation, but was of reduced importance if transcripts initially assumed the active structure, or if enhanced stability of the active structure lowered the activation energy between conversion of the two structures.",

The RdRp was recently implicated in the switch between translation and replication in TCV genomic RNA (X. Yuan and A.E. Simon, unpublished). A portion of the 3\u2032 region of TCV (\u03a82, \u03a83, H4a/H4b and H5) folds into a T-shaped structure [76] that binds to 60S ribosomal subunits and functions (with upstream sequences) as a translational enhancer [83]. Binding of the RdRp to the region causes a substantial shift in the conformation of the RNA from H4 to the 3\u2032 end and disrupts the ribosome-interacting site. This conformational switch is postulated to restrict translation and promote replication (X. Yuan and A.E. Simon, unpublished).",

As an example of creative structural features that stabilize RNA\u2013protein complexes, the HIV TAR RNA bound to arginine has a U(U-A) base triple in the major groove [93]. In the BIV Tat peptide\u2013TAR interaction, the unstacking of nucleotide U10 is the single RNA conformational change that accompanies Tat peptide binding. At the same time, the Tat protein, which is unstructured in the absence of RNA, is conformationally altered to form a \u03b2-hairpin [93]. These critical viral RNA\u2013protein interactions and the corresponding conformational changes promote the assembly of a TAR\u2013Tat\u2013Cyclin T1 complex that facilitates viral RNA transcription.",

The 5\u2032 UTR of HIV genomic RNA can fold into two mutually exclusive conformations called the long-distance interactions form (LDI; Fig. 5, left), and the branched multiple hairpins form (BMH; Fig. 5, right). The LDI form is the more energetically stable, while the BMH form is competent to generate the RNA dimers that are packaged into viral particles. The BMI form also exposes both the splice-donor site (SD) and the RNA packaging hairpin (\u03a8) [86]. The LDI conformation cannot form RNA dimers because the dimerization initiation site (DIS) is not exposed. Experimental data further suggest that the viral nucleocapsid protein induces a shift from LDI to BMH and also BMH to LDI (Fig. 5; [95]). Mihailescu and Marino [97] used NMR spectroscopy to examine the protonation state of HIV-1 RNA in the dimer initiation site region, and concluded that the nucleocapsid protein (NCp7) catalyzes a structural rearrangement that is correlated directly with protonation of the N1 base nitrogen of DIS loop residue A272. The protonation of A272 changes the base pairing potential of the base, thereby providing a molecular mechanism for the conformational changes.",

[86] countered that Paillart et al. did not examine the structures of the spliced leader variants and also commented that the in vivo probing methods employed may not have detected minority structures or transient structures. A recent method, called SHAPE (selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension), has been described as a means of assessing structural features at nearly every nucleotide of an RNA molecule [99]. Using this approach, Wilkinson et al. [99] analyzed structural features of the 5\u2032 10% of the HIV genome under four experimental conditions: 1) HIV-1 genomic RNA inside the virion; 2) HIV-1 genomic RNA extracted from virions; 3) HIV genomic RNA inside the virion, but under conditions where the nucleocapsid protein\u2013RNA interactions were disrupted by aldrithiol-2 (AT-2), a zinc-ejecting agent; and 4) an HIV-1 transcript generated by in vitro transcription. The results of this analysis suggest that HIV RNA forms a single predominant structure that more closely resembles the branched multiple hairpin structure described by Damgaard et al. [100].

The 5\u2032 stem\u2013loop A (SLA) region was identified as a flavivirus promoter element and binding site for the viral RdRp [108]. More recently, an additional region of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 complementarity termed the \u201cUAR\u201d (upstream AUG region) was determined to also be required for replication (Fig. 6\n; [111]).

RNA secondary structure mapping demonstrated that single-stranded AUGC sequences flanked two hairpins at the extreme 3\u2032 terminus (Fig. 7). In the presence of viral coat protein, the AUGC regions were not cleaved by T1 ribonuclease (G-specificity), suggesting either that the AUGCs were protected by bound protein, or that the RNA conformation was altered [120]. A wide range of biochemical methods was applied toward mapping the coat protein binding sites and determining the RNA sequence and structural features that are recognized by the coat protein [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126]. However, it was not until the structure of AMV 3\u2032 terminal RNA bound to the N-terminal arm of the viral coat protein was solved [127] that the extent of conformational changes in both the protein and the RNA became clear. The coat protein-induced pairing is shown schematically in Fig. 7, and the resulting structure is presented in Fig. 8\n. In the presence of the viral coat protein, four new base pairs form that stabilize the complex in a manner that was completely unexpected. A \u201ckink\u201d is present in the backbone, as a result of the inter-AUGC base pairing. Like the Tat\u2013TAR complex, AMV coat protein binding to its RNA is dependent on a critical arginine residue (arg17) that nucleates both binding and conformational changes [128]. The unstructured coat protein N-terminus is converted to an alpha helix with a long tail upon binding RNA; therefore, both the RNA and the protein change their shapes through the process of co-folding. The structure data are consistent with in vitro genetic selection results [129] and also with data suggesting that the RNA is more compact when bound to a coat protein peptide [124].",

One line of reasoning is that coat protein binding to the 3\u2032 terminus generates a unique structure that is critical for template selection and specific RdRp binding, thereby explaining why coat protein is required in the inoculum to initiate viral RNA replication [127], [130], [131]. An alternate proposal [132] is that coat protein binding enhances viral RNA translation by facilitating end-to-end circularization interactions. The crystal structure data are not compatible with the conformational switch model [133], which suggests that the viral RNA structure is extended upon coat protein binding. Instead, the RNA conformation is compacted by the formation of four additional base pairs [127]. Nonetheless, the presence of covarying nucleotides in the 3\u2032 RNA sequence [133] may be consistent with RNA conformation(s) that are important in the viral life cycle. Additional experimentation is needed to gain a better understanding of the switch between viral RNA translation and viral RNA replication.",

First, RIG-I is a prototypical RNA helicase, containing the common conserved motifs. However, the requirement for helicase activity is not understood, with one report stating that helicase activity is inversely proportional to RNA-mediated signaling [137]. Helicases contain ATP binding domains and exhibit ATPase activity; however, Bamming et al. [142] reported that the ATPase motifs can be mutated without loss of biological activity, suggesting that ATPase activity is not essential. Conversely, other authors have reported that disrupting ATPase activity also disrupts signaling [143].

For example, the proposed riboswitch involving LDI and BMH conformers of the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR represents an elegant theoretical mechanism for controlling the differential activities of the viral RNA during its life cycle. However, evidence for the LDI-BMH conformational switch in vivo is lacking. The highly conserved nature of the HIV 5\u2032 UTR nucleotide sequences could be a coincidence for the LDI-BMH folding models; however, short-lived conformers that are difficult to trap experimentally may have important regulatory significance. The limitations of experimental methodologies tend to constrain our image of RNA structures to static rods that are frozen in time, rather than flexible strings with multiple important short-distance and long-distance interactions [112] that are constantly changing with new intra- or inter-molecular interactions. An added dimension is the role of specific RNA\u2013protein interactions that stabilize RNA structures. The AMV RNA\u2013protein complex is an example of how a bound protein can lock an RNA into a conformation that could serve as a regulatory signal. However, a search of the literature reveals that different laboratories often report non-overlapping lists of proteins that bind to a particular viral RNA 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 untranslated region. Future experiments that explore binding kinetics and competition among proteins for overlapping RNA binding sites could bring us closer to understanding how viral RNA translation and replication are coordinately regulated in infected cells.",

Immediately downstream of the final open reading frame of the genome (the N gene) is a bulged stem\u2013loop (BSL), the bottom segment of which also participates in the formation of stem 1 (S1) of a pseudoknot (PK). Both the bulged stem\u2013loop and the pseudoknot are functionally essential for MHV replication, and both structures are strictly conserved among all group 2 coronaviruses. Downstream of these structures is a nonessential hypervariable region (HVR), which is nonessential and divergent in both sequence and structure. Also shown is an association, proposed on the basis of genetic evidence, between the extreme 3\u2032 end of the genome (excluding the poly(A) tail) and the region that becomes loop 1 (L1) of the pseudoknot.

The region encompassed by \u03a83 and \u03a82 in TCV forms a T-shaped structure (TSS) that binds to ribosomes and is a part of the 3\u2032 translational enhancer. In satC, red elements/interactions are found in the pre-active structure, green are found in the active structure and purple are in both structures.

Upon binding either single-stranded viral RNAs with a 5\u2032triphosphate or short double-stranded RNAs, there is a proposed protein conformational change that converts the closed RIG-I form to an open form, exposing the CARD. The open form is thought to oligomerize, activating the signal transduction cascade. Figure modified from [137]. Reprinted with permission from Molecular Cell.",
