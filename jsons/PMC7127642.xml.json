New enterprises can manage a particular customer's Web experience by customer personalization and retain the communication or interaction with the customer. Such understanding of customers can be applied to transform customer information into quality services or products. The maturity of the Internet has brought endless business opportunities for enterprises. However, the overload of information has brought to the notice of E-commerce operators, the necessity of providing more convenient or more intuitive product information. This information enables consumers to find the products they want, thus the consumer loyalty and desires of purchasing may be increased. Therefore, personalized services of recommendations have prospered, such as Amazon, CDNOW, and eBay, which provide services and personalization in order to retain their customers.",

Since the feedback weight setup is different due to different business, it would also affect the precision and learning effect of recommendation systems. Therefore, procedure 2 will test and find the better feedback weight. This part of the experiment mainly focuses on the repeated testing of different weight \u03b2, therefore, the 928 data from the 30 testing objects in the previous procedure will be used again to simulate their behaviors through the feedback weight on \u03b2=1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5. Each testing object and each \u03b2 is tested three times to observe the system's learning ability at different feedback weight. Calculation of recall is expressed by treating the data provided by the testing objects as the denominator to represent the transaction records. The numerator is the number of movies that are recommended by both the testing objects and the recommendation system. For instance, if customer 1001 has 30 movies on transaction records, and 20 of the movies are the same as recommended by the system, then the recall is 20/30=0.6667.",

General recommended movies are only updated periodically and this may only have higher precision for the first time recommendation. Once a user visits the website again in a short timeframe and discovers the same movies are still recommended, the interests will become lower, which decreases overall precision and recall. Fig. 18\nuses F1 measure to include the considerations of precision and recall, which also demonstrates that general recommendation methods perform worse than other personalized recommendation systems.",

Recently, the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has stimulated and revived some E-commerce, which proved its importance. Many companies have constructed websites and started Internet businesses. To save customers' the effort to search for a product, as well as increase customers' loyalty, the recommendation system can truly serve as a mechanism to retain customers. The recommendation system of this research is constructed on a web-based system, mainly combining two recommendation systems, individual customer profile module and customer cluster module. Customer profile module mainly aims to discover a customer's potential interests based on product features, and customer cluster module finds peers of the same interests as target customers. The total amount spent by customers on a particular product is used as a clustering input variable in order to eliminate the disadvantages resulted by over-detailed spending amount, including too many or too scattered dimensions and slow speed. The research is based on movie data, and the result shows that the combined module functions better than just one module. In addition, the result also demonstrates that two-stage clustering can really cluster similar customers effectively, and thus bring recommendation items closer to target customers' interests.",
