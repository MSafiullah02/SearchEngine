Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or throat swab/nasal swab (TS/NS) was collected from cirrhotic patients with pneumonia. BAL sample was collected by trained pulmonologist patients on mechanical ventilator because the TS/NS could not be from them. TS and NS were collected from nonventilated patients with pneumonia. All samples were transported in viral transport media immediately to the virology laboratory on ice. All the samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C till further processing. Complete clinical characteristics of the patient and other biochemical parameters were recorded from the hospital information system. The study was approved by the ethical committee (IRB Reference No: F.25/5/81/ILBS/AC/2015/9601) of the institute.",

The proportion of RV infections were little higher in HAP group than in the CAP group though not significant (17 [56.7%] and 13 [43.3%], respectively, P = 0.47). The comparison of various parameters of cirrhotic patients with and without RV infection is shown in Table 3. Overall, rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common identified virus in 9 (6.0%) cirrhotic patients, followed by influenza A (Flu A) in 5 (3.7%) patients, human coronavirus (HCoV) in 3 (2.2%) patients, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 3 (2.2%) patients, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) in 2 (1.4%) patients, and human metapneumovirus and human adenovirus (HAdV) in one each of the patients. Dual viral infections such as HAdV + HPIV, HCoV + RSV, and HAdV + RhV were found in one each of the patients, respectively [Table 4]. The seasonal distribution of various RVs is described in Figure 2. RhV was present throughout the year. Flu A virus and RSV were mainly present in winter months. HCoV, HAdV, and HPIV were mainly present in summer and early winter seasons. Overall, mortality was seen in 50 (37.0%) cirrhotic patients with pneumonia in ICU. Mortality in cirrhotic patients with RV infection was higher than patients with viral\u2013bacterial coinfection (25 [83.3%] and 7 [43.3%], respectively), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.12). The difference of mortality of patients with RV infection versus patients without RV infection was significant (25 [83.3%] and 11 [12.3%], P < 0.001, respectively). The patients with the median ICU stay of cirrhotic patients with pneumonia were 11 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 2\u201323 days). There was no significant difference in median length of stay of patients in viral infections and viral\u2013bacterial coinfection (9.0 [IQR: 2\u201330] and 10 [IQR: 5\u201332] days, respectively).

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study representing the investigation of viral pneumonia in cirrhotic patients in CCUs. In the present study, we evaluated the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of cirrhotic patients with viral pneumonia in CCUs. Specimens obtained from the upper airway as TS/NS are often used for RV testing in pneumonia patients due to ease of specimen collection in comparison to bronchoscopy collected BAL sample.[11] However, in the current study, the proportion of RVs detected from BAL samples were more than TS/NS though not significant. Therefore, here comes the importance to perform bronchoscopy and collection of BAL sample in the most affected lung segment according to the radiographic signs to recover the responsible respiratory pathogen in patients with pneumonia, especially in patients having chronic liver disease. Over the past decade, several studies have consistently demonstrated RVs to be the second most common etiological factor of CAP, accounting for 13%\u201350% of diagnosed cases of pneumonia in noncirrhotic patients in CCUs.[2] Our study has demonstrated that the proportion of RV infections was little higher in the HCAP group than in the CAP group in cirrhotic patients, which is similar to one recent study done in nonliver adult patients.[1213] A high index of suspicion of viral pneumonia is always necessary in patients with cirrhosis because there are no distinctive clinical features to differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia.; hence, a high index of suspicion is necessary for this infection. None of the previously done studies have shown the spectrum of different RVs in liver disease patients. Only a few studies done in our center have shown the prevalence of influenza virus and its impact on the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients.[7814] The current study has found that respiratory viral infections other than influenza virus infection are also an important etiology of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis admitted in CCUs. Transmission dynamics and seasonal distribution of RVs are key importance in understanding and limiting burden of morbidity and mortality of pneumonia patients in CCUs.[15] In the current study, no clear seasonality is seen for human RhV. Flu A virus and RSV were mainly present in winter months. This finding can inform the timing of Flu A and RSV vaccination and the judicious use of antibiotics in cirrhotic patients admitted in CCUs. Mixed viral and bacterial infections are widely described in pneumonia patients in CCUs; however, the presence of these coinfections on the cirrhotic patients\u2019 clinical outcome remains poorly studied.[16] Various studies suggest that viral and bacterial coinfections lead to a higher severity ongoing disease, especially in patients with chronic disease.[1617] We did not find any significant correlation in mortality and median length of stay in CCUs in patients with only RV infection and viral\u2013bacterial confection which is not in concordance of previous done studies.[18]",

Nevertheless, our investigation provided the first comprehensive study of the prevalence of RVs and its epidemiology in cirrhotic patients with pneumonia in CCUs. With the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with RV infections and the lack of directed antiviral therapy for most of these infections, prevention remains the mainstay for reducing their incidence and controlling transmission of RVs, especially in CCUs settings.",
