Patients who withdrew because of changed work circumstances and had reached maintenance doses were offered opportunities to complete conventional VIT treatment in community-based settings.

The models included fixed effects for intervention group, time (as a categorical variables from 0-15 for the 16 visits), age category (greater than or less than the median age), and sex.

Specific IgE levels got back to baseline values by around weeks 14 to 26 in both groups and then progressively decreased through to the end of the study. When analyzed by ANOVA for differences by group, time, sex, and age, the reduction in specific IgE levels was significant for both groups over time (P = .001) but was not significantly different between groups (Fig 2).

Examination of the specific IgE responses in individual subjects (see Figs E9 and E10 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), revealed 2 different patterns; 1 pattern showed immediate decreases in specific IgE after commencement of VIT, whereas the another pattern showed a large (>2-fold) increase in specific IgE levels between weeks 5 and 9 after VIT initiation with specific IgE only decreasing below baseline levels after 6 to 12 months of maintenance VIT. Approximately half the subjects in both groups fell into each pattern. Subjects who had multiple stings in a short space of time (eg, subjects 8, 14, and 21) had a major increase in their specific IgE levels immediately after this, suggesting the stings had caused either priming or boosting of an underlying IgE memory B-cell response (see Figs E9 and E10).",

At study entry, mean levels of specific IgG4 were not significantly different between groups (Fig 2), and were low in all subjects bar 1 subject in the AHBVIT group (subject 16, see Fig E10). To exclude the possibility that the high baseline IgG4 result in this subject was due to interfering anti-mouse antibodies, we tested whether their specific IgG4 activity could be adsorbed out by adding mouse sera or bee venom to the soluble phase during the assay. The specific IgG4 activity was adsorbed out by bee venom but not normal mouse sera (data not shown), confirming that this subject had a high specific IgG4 level before starting VIT.",

By contrast, in the SHBVIT group, peak specific IgG4 levels were lower and rapidly waned back toward baseline levels even with ongoing maintenance therapy. This is consistent with a study that showed only modest ~3-fold increases from baseline in specific IgG4 levels after 2 years of standard VIT with ~2-fold reductions in specific IgE levels.49 It remains unclear whether the increase in specific IgG4 levels or the decrease in specific IgE levels is more relevant to VIT clinical efficacy. This might reflect the previous difficulty in inducing sufficiently high blocking IgG4, a problem that our study suggests can be solved by incorporating Advax adjuvant into VIT. In the clinical response to grass pollen immunotherapy, functional assays of IgG4-associated inhibitory activity, such as inhibition of IgE-allergen interactions and inhibition of CD23-dependent IgE-facilitated allergen binding, correlated better with clinical outcome than immunoreactive IgG4 levels.50 Hence it will be interesting in future studies of Advax-adjuvanted VIT to also include functional assays of IgG4-associated inhibitory activity.",

All recalled AHBVIT participants had evidence of even further attenuation of their specific IgE levels from the time of study completion (Fig 2). This continued long-term decrease in specific IgE levels might reflect natural death over time of IgE-producing plasmablasts together with failure to replace these because of depletion of the memory B-cell compartment required to replenish IgE+ plasmablasts and/or the effect of regulatory T cells preventing the generation of IgE-producing B cells.

We speculate that the lack of reactions in this group despite the increase in IgE levels might have been because there was a parallel increase in these subjects of specific IgG1 and IgG4, that might have more than compensated for the increase in IgE.",

Interestingly, in 2 subjects, 1 in the SHBVIT group (subject 21) and 1 in the AHBVIT group (subject 14), there was a sharp increase in specific IgE levels in response to a series of bee stings, suggesting the possibility of bee stings restimulating IgE production, despite ongoing VIT. How fresh stings might induce different immune responses to the bee venom used for VIT is not clear but might reflect additional labile vasoactive substances and enzymes contained in fresh venom that are no longer present in preserved bee venom.",

Although not directly assessed by this study, the increase in specific IgG4 levels in the Advax adjuvant group during the early induction phase, when only very low doses of allergen were being administered, suggests Advax adjuvant might have useful venom dose-sparing ability, particularly during the early stages of VIT. Importantly, for the first time in human subjects, this study confirmed the safety and tolerability of VIT combined with Advax adjuvant. Hence Advax adjuvant is a promising candidate for VIT, with an ongoing study assessing its ability to provide antigen-sparing effects for ant venom allergy therapy.",
