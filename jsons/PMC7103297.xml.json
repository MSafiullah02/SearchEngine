A regulatable system that can turn \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d therapeutic gene expression will not only be crucial for maintaining appropriate levels of a gene product within the therapeutic range, thus preventing toxicity, but also allow the turning \u201coff\u201d of therapeutic gene expression to avoid harmful side effects. The development of ligand-dependent transcription regulatory systems is thus of great importance.",

Seven repeats of the TetO DNA sequence, also referred to as TRE (for Tet-responsive elements), are fused upstream of a minimal CMV promoter (PminCMV), forming the compound promoter PCMV-1\n[1]. In the absence of Dox, tTA binds to the TREs thus activating PCMV-1, which results in the expression of the adjacent gene (Fig. 1B). If Dox is present, tTA changes its conformation, detaches from the TREs and gene expression is silenced. Furth and colleagues have shown for the first time the functionality of the system in vivo in bigenic mice harbouring the tTA gene and a reporter gene [22]. To minimize possible interactions of the VP16 transactivator with other cellular promoters and to avoid the onset of immune reactions, this protein was reduced to three minimal repeats of 12 amino acids [23].",

Deuschle and colleagues developed a system, in which the original TetR protein was fused to the transrepressing domain KRAB of the human Zink finger protein Kox1, forming a transinhibitor called TetR-KRAB, or tTS [21], [29], [30]. In other studies, the KRAB domain has been retrieved from the rodent Zink finger protein Kid-1 and the transrepressor is called tTSKid\n[31], [32]. Zink finger proteins are regulatory proteins and their KRAB domain is known to inhibit all RNA polymerases II or III within a range of 3 kB of its DNA attachment site [21], [33]. The second part of the TetR-KRAB system, the compound promoter (PTetO-CMVlg) used for the expression of the transgene, consists of TRE fused upstream to a normal CMV promoter that does not need activation. In the absence of Dox, TetR-KRAB gets attached to the TRE and inhibits the activity of the CMV promoter, while in the presence of Dox, TetR-KRAB gets detached from the TRE, thus allowing transgene expression (Fig. 1D).",

Therefore, the inducible PCMV-1 promoter cannot interact with constitutively expressed rtTA in a Dox-independent, non-specific manner. Dox-mediated induction of expression of the gene of interest may take longer, as the rtTA has to be expressed first, but the immunogenicity and potential toxicity of the transactivator is restricted to the time of induction.

In addition, the woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) was introduced following the EPO cDNA. Based on the evaluation of different designs of the expression cassette in mice, it was observed that when both promoters driving the expression of the transgene and the rtTA-M2 were positioned apart from each other, but oriented in the same direction (forward), inducibility was optimal and background expression remained minimal. This cassette (forward) was then studied in the muscle of nonhuman primates using the AAV1 and AAV2 serotypes. It was shown that using the AAV1 serotype for the transduction of primate skeletal muscle, almost 10 times higher serum EPO concentration could be observed compared to animals injected with serotype AAV2. In addition, the inducibility of the system seemed to be more effective in nonhuman primates than in mice, since a 50\u2013200-fold increase of serum EPO could be observed with almost no baseline activity, while in mice the difference was around 20-fold. However, these values have to be studied with caution, as baseline expression of EPO could be quite undetectable in primates due to the large volume of blood in the circulatory system that would dilute the serum concentration of EPO [13].",

A mix of both vectors was injected subretinally into rats, thus targeting photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The results demonstrated a successful induction and de-induction of GFP expression within 2 weeks of Dox administration or withdrawal respectively. No apparent side effects were observed. However, GFP expression was relatively low when compared to CMV driven expression, which was due to the ratio of both vectors injected (GFP containing vector and combined TetOn containing vector at 1:8) as well as the necessity of both vectors to transduce the same cell. Oral administration of Dox at very low levels (2 \u03bcM) allowed for the onset of GFP expression, which increased with the increasing dose of Dox administered.",

The introduction of the WPRE sequence behind the GDNF gene did not increase protein levels in the induced state whereas basal levels were 2.5-fold higher [63]. The biological activity of the transgenic GDNF was proven by the downregulation of TH in dopaminergic terminals of neurons in induced animals.

The combination of HSV-1-thymindine kinase (HSV-1-TK) with gancyclovir (GCV) is the most widely used system in cancer gene therapy. It has been shown that an immunotherapeutic approach that combines the cytotoxic properties of HSV-1-TK, which kills glioma cells in the presence of GCV alone or in combination with the immunostimulatory effects of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), is very efficient in eliminating large, intracranial, malignant glioblastoma in rats [109]. However, the use of first generation adenoviral vectors and the detection of an immune response against HSV-1-TK in survivors of glioma cancer demonstrated the need for a regulated expression of the transgene, particularly the \u201cturn off\u201d in case of a successful therapeutic outcome.",

Within 6 days of Dox administration via the drinking water, transgene expression reached to a maximum and decreased to background levels within 10\u201314 days of the withdrawal of Dox. As observed in other studies, the expression of \u00df-gal in the induced state was dependent on the dose of Dox administered. Inducibility of transgene expression was the best and background levels the lowest with the mCMV-TetOn system [66], [110]. Importantly, the regulated transgene expression was possible even in the presence of a strong systemic immune reaction against adenoviruses, highlighting the possibility to use this system in patients with prior exposure to adenovirus, a common human infection. Therefore, the authors continued to work with the murine promoter to construct an expression cassette that would control the expression of the immunostimulatory protein, Flt3L, using the HC-Ad vector system [110]. A second vector encoded the HSV-1-TK protein, which is toxic only in the presence of GCV, driven by a continuous promoter. Cytotoxic activity would be initiated by the application of GCV. After having shown the tight control of transgene expression in human glioma cells [110], the system was studied in canine glioma cells [111]. The spontaneous development of glioblastoma multiforme in a variety of dog breeds makes these animals a precious large animal model for the development of gene therapy strategies for this disease. Both HC-Ads successfully transduced dog glioma cells and exerted anti-tumoural effects in these cells in vitro. Therefore, this strategy may be a possible treatment option for glioblastoma multiforme in dogs, and subsequently in human clinical trials.",

A two-plasmid gene therapy strategy using the TetOff system to regulate expression of pro-opiomelanocortin, which is the precursor gene of \u03b2-endorphin, has been developed and tested in the rat model of CCI [112]. Expression of \u03b2-endorphin was regulated over a duration of 14 days by intraperitoneal administration of Dox; nociceptive sensitivity was reduced in rats that expressed this protein. In an attempt to develop the strategy into a more clinically relevant setting, the authors produced a three-plasmid strategy coding for the pro-opiomelanocortin gene, the rtTA transactivator and the tTS silencer [113]. The three plasmids were coelectroporated into the spinal cord of rats and the analgesic potential was measured by heat and mechanical sensitivity tests.

The use of a neuron specific promoter, synapsin 1 gene promoter, to drive rtTA-M2 expression assured highly specific neuronal transgene expression. Within two weeks of Dox administration (3 mg/kg), the expression of ILK was markedly reduced, returning to normal values within 8 days of Dox withdrawal. This study shows that conditional gene silencing can be established in distinct brain regions using rAAV delivered and TetOn-regulated siRNA expression.

Monkeys of the genus Sanguinus, commonly called tamarins, have been proposed to be a surrogate model to study virus induced hepatitis after infection with a flavivirus, GB virus B (GBV-B). To study the effect of IFN-\u03b1 expression following gene transfer to the liver in this model, an adenoviral vector was developed that controlled the expression of tamarin IFN-\u03b1 by use of the TetOn (rtTA-S2) system. Following successful demonstration of the functionality of the system in mice and rats, the vector was injected intravenously into 4 monkeys and initially tested for the regulation of IFN-\u03b1 expression in the liver. At 14 days post-injection, transgene expression was induced for 3 days by oral administration of Dox (10 mg/kg). Two of the monkeys exhibited an 8-to-16 fold increase of IFN-\u03b1 serum levels, while the other two monkeys showed lower increases of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum. Within 3\u20135 days of Dox withdrawal, serum IFN-\u03b1 levels decreased to baseline levels. The inductions were repeated three times and demonstrated the reinducibility of the system. At day 42 post-injection of the adenoviral vector, IFN-\u03b1 expression was induced by Dox administration and the animals were challenged with a dose of GBV-B virus. From this moment on, Dox was given continuously until day 150, the end of the experiment, to ensure local liver expression of IFN-\u03b1. Even though all animals became viraemic, the expression of IFN-\u03b1 delayed significantly the onset of the disease. More importantly, all except one animal exhibited low but measurable levels of IFN-\u03b1 secretion despite inflammation in the expressing organ. The authors discussed various reasons for the lack of complete protection from viral hepatitis compared to the rodent study, including the difference of the maximum level of IFN-\u03b1 in the serum of induced mice (4000 fold) compared to primates (maximal 32-fold). This is an often observed discrepancy that needs to be taken into account when developing a gene therapy strategy from the mouse to large animal models.",

The Tet-system employed was the TetOff system and kinetics of tTA-mediated control of transgene expression were similar to what had been observed in other studies. To switch the system \u201coff\u201d, Dox was administered via the drinking water (200 \u03bcg/ml) and, within 8 days, transgene expression was not detectable. The \u201con\u201d switch, however, took 4 weeks to completely restore transgene expression in these animals, as the slow clearance of the inducer drug defines the kinetics in this system. A second group developed a lentivirus vector, in which SEAP expression was controlled by different versions of the pure TetOn and combined TetOn system [47]. Based on their observations, the authors proposed the simple TetOn system as the most appropriate regulatory system for the control of transgene expression in the hematopoietic system.",

Initially, two plasmids, the first containing the HSV-1-TK gene under control of an inducible promoter and the second containing the rtTA Transactivator, were generated in retroviral vector plasmids [123]. These two vector plasmids were co-transduced into human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and 7 days following Dox induction, these cells were implanted into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) bearing breast cancer xenografts. Following GCV administration, tumour cells bearing the HSV-1-TK produced toxic molecules and were subsequently eradicated from the tissue. More importantly, due to a bystander effect, which is a known effect of HSV-1-TK, adjacent cells from the implanted tumour xenograft were also arrested in their growth and tumour size remarkably decreased. In the following step, the experiments were performed using retroviral vectors based on the above-mentioned plasmids for the transfer of the regulatory system directly into tumour xenografts transplanted in nude mice [125]. Transduced cells were sensitive to GCV beginning at 14 days following retrovirus vector administration. HSV-1-TK mRNA increased significantly in tumour tissue and within 6 weeks, the tumour size decreased remarkably and the treated mice achieved long-term survival. To further adjust the treatment strategy for subsequent use in the clinics, the two-retroviral vector system was replaced by a one vector strategy using rAAV2 virus [124]. Again, direct injection of rAAV2 vectors resulted in GCV sensitivity within the tumour 14 days following vector and GCV administration. Similar results concerning tumour size and HSV-1-TK mRNA levels were observed compared to the retroviral vector study. The authors conclude that the regulated expression of HSV-1-TK together with the administration of GCV may be a useful method for the treatment of breast cancer and other solid tumours.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: Schematic representations of the five different Tet-regulatable systems. (A) In general, Tet-regulatable systems are composed of two distinct expression cassettes, one containing the regulatory protein (tTA, rtTA, tTS) under the control of a ubiquitous cell type specific promoter (cassette A) and the second cassette containing the Tetracycline Responsive Element (TRE) fused to a promoter, regulating the expression of the reporter or therapeutic transgene (cassette B). (B) The chimeric protein tTA is composed of the TetR fused to the viral transactivator VP16. In the absence of Dox, the tTA protein binds to the TRE within the compound promoter PCMVmin to allow the expression of the transgene. In the presence of Dox, the tTA changes its conformation, gets detached from the TRE and no transgene expression is observed. (C) The rtTA transactivator is also a chimeric protein composed of the TetR and the VP16 domains. However, due to the presence of four mutations in the TetR (now called rTetR) domain, this protein fixes the TRE in the presence of Dox, thus allowing transgene expression. In the absence of Dox, rtTA gets detached from the TRE and no transgene expression is observed. (D) The chimeric protein tTS is composed of the TetR fused to the KRAB box of Zink finger proteins. In the absence of Dox, tTS binds to the TRE and inhibits transgene expression driven by a normal promoter (i.e. CMV). In the presence of Dox, tTS gets detached from the TRE, thus allowing transgene expression. (E) The combined TetOn system contains both the rtTA and the tTS protein, simultaneously expressed from cassette A. In the absence of Dox, the tTS protein binds to the minimal compound promoter and inhibits even the low background expression, while the rtTA protein stays detached from the TRE. In the presence of Dox, rtTA binds to the TRE and activates expression of the transgene, while tTS stays detached. (F) In the autoregulatory loop system, both rtTA (or tTA) and the transgene of interest are driven by the compound minimal promoter separated by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). In the absence of Dox, no transgene is expressed, while in the presence of Dox, both transgenes, transactivator and gene of interest, are expressed. Onset of expression takes longer, because initially, sufficient amounts of rtTA need to be produced to completely activate the system.",
