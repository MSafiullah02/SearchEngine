The virus was titrated at regular intervals of the passage level. Open reading frame (ORF) 3 sequences of the virus at passage levels 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 were aligned and compared using a computer software program. Suitability of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for differentiating the virus from other Korean field strains was investigated. The DR13 field isolate was successively adapted in Vero cells as observed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and titration of the virus. RFLP analysis identified change in cleavage sites of HindIII and Xho II from passage levels 75 and 90, respectively; these RFLP patterns of ORF 3 differentiated the Vero cell-adapted virus from its parent strain, DR13, and 12 other strains of PEDV studied. The cell adapted DR13 was tested for its pathogenicity and immunogenicity in piglets and pregnant sows. The results indicated that cell adapted DR13 revealed reduced pathogenicity and induced protective immune response in pigs. Differentiation between highly Vero cell-adapted virus and wild-type virus could be the marker of adaptation to cell culture and a valuable tool for epidemiologic studies of PEDV infections. The results of this study supported that the cell attenuated virus could be applied as a marker vaccine candidate against PEDV infection.",

The changes appear to have resulted from high passage of the virus through cell cultures. Virulence of TGEV in piglets was reduced through serial passage in cell cultures [25] . And ORF 3 has been suggested as an important determinant for the virulence of the virus. PEDV consists of spike (S), membrane (M), small membrane (sM), ORF 3, and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and all have been sequenced [2, 7] . The loss of ORF 3 product demonstrated an unexpected feature caused by the adaptation in cell culture [3, 21] , which may explain why the adaptation of PEDV in cell culture may reduce the virulence of wild-type virus. Piglets inoculated with a PEDV serially passaged in Vero cells showed reduced disease and lesions [13] . Therefore, unexpected features observed through cell culture is of much interest.",

Samples were amplified using a program that consisted of: incubation at 94 \u2022 C for 5 min; followed by five cycles of denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, annealing at 55 \u2022 C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 30 s; and 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, annealing at 53 \u2022 C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 30 s, adding 1 s every cycle. At the completion of cycling, samples were kept at 72 \u2022 C for 7 min and then cooled. S genes of serially passaged PEDV were amplified through RT-PCR at levels 0, 1, 30, 60, 90, and 100.",

The authors found nine nucleotide changes over the course of attenuation in Vero cells; however, in the case of its parent PEDV, only one nucleotide change was identified from the ORF 3 of CV777. And the M gene and partial S gene sequences were compared between cell adapted DR13 and parent DR13. Cell adapted DR13 showed 98.53 and 99.07% sequence homologies, respectively. In addition, cleavage sites of the restriction enzymes, HindIII and Xho II, were identified for RFLP analysis. Serial passage of DR13 strain conducted up to passage level 100 showed distinct RFLP patterns. In sequence data, different HindIII and Xho II sites were found from passage level 80 and passage level 100, respectively. But the change in RFLP patterns of HindIII and Xho II could be identified from passage levels 75 and 90, suggesting that the different HindIII and Xho II recognition sites changed from passage levels 75 and 90, respectively. The cleavage site of Xho II located at one of the three variable regions observed in PEDV ORF 3. In a previous study, three variable regions in ORF 3 gene were reported [8] . In this study, the sequence variation of cell culture-adapted PEDV (passage level 100) occurred in only one region among the three variable regions.",

Change in ORF 3 demonstrated an unexpected feature as a consequence of the adaptation to the cell culture. However, RFLP patterns of KPEDV-9 and P-5V of Japanese PED live virus vaccine strain (Nisseiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were the same as those of wild-type PEDVs by two restriction enzymes. Highly cell culture-adapted PEDV could be differentiated from KPEDV-9 and P-5V through the RFLP method (data not presented here).",

And also all the inoculated sows had no clinical signs like abortion, diarrhea, anorexia, and pyrexia. Antibody was detected through serum from piglets and colostrums from pregnant sows. Because the protection of the piglets against PEDV is based on the specific antibodies which have been demonstrated in the colostrums of the immune sows, we evaluated the antibody titer of colostrums from pregnant sows. However there would be variable in piglets' immunity according to the degree of colostrums uptake of a piglet, litter size, the concentration of antibodies and the quality of colostrums.",
