Patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism were older, and were more likely to have a high risk of bleeding, to have been admitted to the intensive care unit, to have had mechanical ventilation, and to have died as a result of COVID-19 or COVID-19 complications, such as venous thromboembolism, than patients at low risk of venous thromboembolism (table\n). Laboratory findings on admission showed that more patients with high risk of venous thromboembolism had abnormal concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein than did patients with low risk after adjustment for age (appendix).",

However, only ten (7%) of 140 patients for whom anticoagulation data were available in our cohort had received anticoagulant drugs during hospitalisation (nine were given heparin and one rivaroxaban)\u2014a lower proportion than the proportion of patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism. This finding could suggest that venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was not adequate in this cohort of patients with COVID-19.

For these patients, the dose and duration of anticoagulants should be adjusted, and mechanical compressions such as elastic compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression are warranted. Patients with COVID-19 can rapidly develop severe or critical disease, causing a series of complications such as renal failure, respiratory failure, or liver dysfunction,2, 3, 10 which can affect both venous thromboembolism and bleeding status. Therefore, assessing venous thromboembolism and bleeding risks regularly is essential. Additionally, we found that patients with COVID-19 with a high risk of venous thromboembolism had poorer outcomes than patients with a low risk, suggesting that these patients might require increased attention in case of rapid deterioration.",
