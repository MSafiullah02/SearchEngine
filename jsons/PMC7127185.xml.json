Within Herpesviridae, HCMV belongs to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily.1 One characteristic feature of the herpesviruses, including HCMV, is the ability to remain latent within the body after infection.2 Latent HCMV is present in approximately 90% of adults aged over 80 in the U.S.,3 and typically goes unnoticed in healthy people, but can be life-threatening for the immunocompromised person. In this regard, HIV-infected persons,4, 5 organ transplant recipients,6 or newborn infants are all at high risk of infection. Transplacental HCMV transmission can lead to congenital abnormalities and stillbirth, thus represents one of the most common viral causes of birth defects.7 HCMV infection may also cause mucoepidermoid carcinoma and possibly other malignancies.8 Moreover, a number of studies have revealed that HCMV is associated with autoimmune diseases,9 atherosclerosis,10 coronary restenosis11, 12 and increased risk of diabetes.13, 14\n",

They exhibit their effects by inhibiting the activity of the HCMV polymerase, thus reducing viral replication in patients with recognized HCMV infection symptoms. The use of these drugs however has been severely limited by their toxicity.18 In addition, due to their inherent poor oral bioavailability, they must be administered intravenously to reach appropriate therapeutic levels. The exception to this limitation is valganciclovir, the orally administered prodrug for ganciclovir.19 Unfortunately, as is typical for many nucleoside drugs, the development of drug-resistant viral strains has emerged.20, 21, 22 Thus, there is an urgent need for new and more effective anti-HCMV agents with improved activity and pharmacokinetic profiles.",

Potent anti-HCMV and anti-VZV activity was also noted for other heterocyclic-based inhibitors including imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives 3\n26, 27, 28 and benzothiadiazines 4.29, 30 Other examples of broad-spectrum herpesvirus inhibitors are represented by derivatives of fused heterocyclic systems including the quinolones,31 thieno[2,3-b]-,32 thieno[3,2-b]-,33 furo[2,3-b]pyridines34 (5) and pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolones35 (6), all developed by Pfizer (Fig. 1).

Most of the compounds proved to be inhibitory against HCMV. In examining the structure activity relationship for the compounds, it appears that the activity is strongly dependent upon the substituent at the para-position of the benzene core. Polar groups proved unfavorable and resulted in a loss of activity (compounds 18, 21, 29). Activity for alkyl substituted compounds increased with the size of the substituent: EC50 for H (9) = Me (12) < \ni-Pr (14) < \nt-Bu (15), however, introduction of a bulky phenyl group led to poor activity for 16, thus there appears to be a steric limit. The 4-cyano- (17) and 4-bromo- (20) substituted compounds were found to exhibit the highest activity, which was comparable to ganciclovir. Interestingly, the 4-chloro-substituted compound 19 was essentially inactive. One possible rationale for these observations could be complementary polar interactions between the halogen- or cyano-substituents and an appropriate protein functionality, for example, a carbonyl group, since the oxygen-containing compound 29 was inactive. This assumption is partially supported by the fact that reduction of NO2-group in inactive compound 21 led to 4-amino substituted compound 30 which exhibited slight anti-HCMV activity.",

NMR spectra were registered on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C) in DMSO-d\n6 with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Data are reported in the following order: multiplicity (br, broad; s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets; t, triplet; m, multiplet; q, quartet; qu, quintet). TLC was performed on Merck TLC Silica gel 60 F254 plates eluted with ethyl acetate or chloroform/MeOH (10:1) and developed with UV-lamp VL-6.LC (France). Acros Organics (Belgium) silica gel (Kieselgur 60\u2013200 \u03bcm, 60A) was used for column chromatography. Melting points were determined in glass capillaries on a Mel-Temp 3.0 (Laboratory Devices Inc., U.S.). Yields refer to spectroscopically (1H and 13C NMR) homogeneous materials. High resolution mass spectra were measured on Bruker micrOTOF II instruments using electrospray ionization (HRESIMS). The measurements were done in a positive ion mode (interface capillary voltage \u22124500 V) in a mass range from m/z 50\u20133000 Da; external or internal calibration was done with ESI Tuning Mix\u2122 (Agilent Technologies). A syringe injection was used for solutions in acetonitrile (flow rate 3 \u03bcl/min). Nitrogen was applied as a dry gas; interface temperature was set at 180 \u00b0C.
