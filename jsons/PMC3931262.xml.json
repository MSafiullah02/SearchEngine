Since the identification of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), there have been 150 confirmed cases and 64 deaths; a fatality/case ratio of over 40% (World Health Organization, 2013). Currently it is unclear if there are additional asymptomatic cases of infection with MERS-CoV. MERS is reminiscent of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the Guangdong province in China in 2002\u20132003 (reviewed in Cheng et al., 2013).",

Recently, a SARS-like bat coronavirus was isolated that can directly infect human cells (Ge et al., 2013), suggesting that emerging coronaviruses may be transmitted directly from bats to humans. MERS-CoV is capable of infecting bat and human cells directly; as both the bat and human forms of the receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, support viral entry (Muller et al., 2012, Raj et al., 2013). Additionally, a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene that is genetically identical to MERS-CoV was detected in one Egyptian Tomb bat (Memish et al., 2013) and dromedary camels were found to have neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV, perhaps linking an endemic source of the virus and an intermediate host to human MERS-CoV infections (Perera et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2013).",

However, much has been learned from studies evaluating inhibitors directed against SARS-CoV that can be applied to new emergent coronaviruses. Understanding the experimental methods and results of studies performed to screen for SARS-CoV antivirals can guide the current work to develop drugs against MERS-CoV or to ultimately identify pan-coronavirus inhibitors. Cell-based assays are of great importance when developing effective antivirals, as these assays can identify possible antivirals from candidates initially selected from in vitro screens. The focus of this review will be to outline potential drug targets in the coronavirus life cycle, describe cell-based assays used to test antivirals against SARS-CoV, highlight novel techniques used to evaluate potential antivirals against MERS-CoV and discuss the challenges facing anti-coronaviral drug development.",

            "text": "The coronavirus genome encodes many druggable targets, and these targets are highlighted in their role in the replication cycle life cycle (Fig. 1\n). Human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DDP4, CD26) has been discovered as the receptor for MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 2013), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein has been identified and structurally characterized (Chen et al., 2013, Du et al., 2013, Mou et al., 2013) and the crystal structure of the complex between DPP4 and the RBD has been determined (Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013 and reviewed in Li, 2013). The interactions between viral glycoproteins and receptors have been targeted in other viruses, including SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses can enter cells through receptor mediated endocytosis or by membrane fusion with the plasma membrane. Endocytosis of the receptor\u2013virus complex can occur, and upon acidification of the endosome, the host protease cathepsin L is activated and can cleave the viral spike protein to initiate viral fusion. The coronaviral spike can also be activated by extracellular proteases (trypsin) or proteases present on the cell surface (type II transmembrane serine protease or TMPRSS2), and this cleavage allows coronaviruses to enter cells in an cathepsin-independent manner (Glowacka et al., 2011, Matsuyama et al., 2010, Shulla et al., 2011 and reviewed in Simmons et al., 2013). Upon viral entry and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, the positive sense RNA genome, which is 5\u2032 methyl-capped and poly-adenylated, is translated in the cytoplasm. This translation yields two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, which are then cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins by the papain-like protease, encoded within nsp3, and the 3C-like protease, encoded by nsp5. The proteases are drug targets, as the proteolysis of the non-structural proteins is required for replication of the virus. Further, the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses has been shown to antagonize host innate immune responses, so inhibiting the papain-like protease will stop viral replication and may prevent antagonism of host innate immune responses (Barretto et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2007, Devaraj et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2012). Successful inhibitors have been generated against both SARS-CoV PLpro and 3CLpro.",

The antiviral Maraviroc is a small-molecule CCR5 antagonist that inhibits the HIV-1 glycoprotein from binding to its receptor CCR5. Using a different mechanism, the antiviral enfuvirtide inhibits viral fusion by interrupting the interaction between heptad repeat regions within the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp41. Partially based on the success of this strategy, both small-molecule and peptide inhibitors have been identified that target the entry of SARS-CoV.

In contrast to the previous cell-based screens based on virally induced CPE, pseudotyped lentiviral virions delivering a genome expressing GFP, luciferase, or other reporters allow for quantitative measurement and evaluation of coronaviral entry inhibitors. These assays can be used in BSL-2 laboratories and do not involve work with infectious CoVs. Using these techniques, the first demonstration of SARS-CoV entry inhibition was achieved using pieces of the SARS-CoV S or peptides designed to interact with the S, with the goal of both approaches to block viral membrane fusion intermediates (Yuan et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004).

Using a commercial screen of diverse compounds (50,240 compound screen from ChemBridge) a small-molecule inhibitor was found to inhibit SARS-CoV entry based first on virally induced CPE reduction and then prevention of pseudotyped virion entry (Kao et al., 2004). Shortly after the demonstration that small-molecule compounds could target SARS-CoV entry, Yi et al. demonstrated that natural compound screens could also be used to inhibit SARS-CoV entry (Yi et al., 2004). They showed inhibition by small-molecules in a pseudotyped virion screen and identified two candidates that inhibited entry in the micromolar range. Utilizing a luciferase expressing lentiviral vector pseudotyped with S protein, molecules were screened based on luciferase expression levels of transduced cells. Two molecules, TGG and leuteolin (screened from a Chinese herbal library) were shown to have antiviral activity in the pseudotype assay and confirmed with live virus using an MTT colorimetric assay for cytotoxicity. These initial studies have evolved into three classes of inhibitor studies; small peptides that block viral fusion by interacting with SARS-CoV S, inhibition of cellular proteases that cleave the viral glycoprotein to mediate entry, and small chemical compounds that interact with the SARS-CoV S and inhibit entry.",

Inhibition at these interfaces has not been previously observed, and suggested a novel targeting strategy for prevention of S mediated viral entry.",

Importantly, their studies determined that these effects could only be seen with a 20 min adsorption, and that the commonly used 60 min adsorption time led to a high background and could not properly identify inhibitors in the pseudotype assay. Based on these studies, the authors created peptides corresponding to the amino acids from residues 22\u201357 and determined that these peptides had specific inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV pseudotype entry, but not entry of VSV-G psuedotypes.

Catalytic mutants of ACE2 had no effect on viral entry, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of coronaviral receptors is not required for entry (Moore et al., 2004). The SARS-CoV S protein requires cleavage either extracellularly by trypsin or TMPRRS2 or within the endosomal compartment by cathepsin L (Fig. 1). Simmons et al. determined that cathepsin L mediates SARS-CoV S protein cleavage and that it can be pharmacologically targeted to prevent SARS-CoV S cleavage and entry (Simmons et al., 2005). In this study, a unique virus\u2013virus membrane fusion assay was utilized. This assay involves two psuedotyped virions, one decorated with SARS-CoV S and the Avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) envelope protein, and one containing ACE2 and a luciferase expression construct. These particles can be induced to undergo fusion in vitro, and particles able to enter cells containing the ASLV receptor and express luciferase must have undergone viral membrane fusion upon mixing of the two pseudoparticle populations. If cathepsin L is responsible for S cleavage within endosomes, then inhibition of purified cathepsin L in vitro will prevent viral\u2013viral membrane fusion and no pseudoparticle expressed luciferase will be detected. The authors used this assay to demonstrate cathepsin L activation of SARS-CoV S and also that other endosomal cathepsins were not responsible for mediating SARS-CoV entry. Cathepsin L has been the continued target of antiviral development not only for SARS-CoV but other enveloped viruses that have a cleavage requirement within their glycoproteins, such as Ebola virus (Shah et al., 2010).",

Cell\u2013cell fusion assays have been used to identify and characterize plasma membrane surface factors, and can be used to investigate cell surface fusion inhibitors. Cells expressing SARS-CoV S and a T7 polymerase are plated with cells expressing ACE2 and a luciferase or GFP reporter plasmid driven by a T7-dependent promoter. Upon receptor interaction and fusion, the cytoplasm from both cell types mixes, allowing for the transcription and translation of the luciferase or GFP (Shulla et al., 2011, Simmons et al., 2005). Pseudotyped virions were used by Kawase et al. in their work identifying commercially available protease inhibitors targeting TMPRRS2 (Kawase et al., 2012). Inhibiting only serine proteases, which includes TMPRRS2, partially inhibited the entry of pseudotyped particles; however, also inhibiting cysteine proteases (which includes cathepsins) fully inhibited the entry of both pseudoparticles and authentic SARS-CoV. Targeting these host cell factors has been shown to be an effective way to prevent viral fusion and entry in cell culture.",

Recently, Adedeji et al. used a SARS-CoV S pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus to screen a 3000 compound library (Adedeji et al., 2013). Forty-four hits were taken from this library and analyzed for specificity against SARS-CoV entry as compared to inhibition of a VSV-G enveloped HIV-Luc pseudovirus. Out of the initial 44 compounds, only 3 were found to be specific for inhibition of SARS-CoV. These counter screens highlight the importance of identifying specific compounds before undergoing further analysis of positive hits in initial screens. Further in vitro analysis was performed and the three compounds were identified to separately inhibit cathepsin L activity, inhibit interaction between S and ACE2, and inhibit a fusion step downstream of S-ACE2 recognition. The feasibility of chemical compound inhibition of virus entry is an established strategy to develop efficacious antivirals, especially for HIV; however, small compounds remain a relatively unexplored strategy with respect to coronaviruses. Overall, targeting viral entry of coronaviruses (especially SARS-CoV) has been demonstrated using specific cell-based assays outlined here. These strategies can be utilized for the evaluation of peptides or chemical inhibitors of S protein-receptor interaction, S-mediated fusion, or host cell factors necessary for mediating MERS-CoV and other emerging coronavirus entry.",

For replication to continue, these polyproteins must be cleaved by viral proteases, either 1 or 2 papain-like proteases (designated PLpro or PLP1/PLP2) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro or Mpro for main protease). This step in the replicative process has been the target of the most extensive work done to identify inhibitors for SARS-CoV replication (reviewed in Barnard and Kumaki, 2011). SARS-CoV PLpro is responsible for three cleavages while SARS-CoV 3CLpro cleaves the polyprotein at 11 sites (Fig. 1). Because the use of proteases is conserved across coronaviruses, both PLpro and 3CLpro are considered attractive targets for antiviral drug development. Much of the antiviral work performed with the coronaviral proteases has been done using in vitro, cell free conditions, and this work is crucial in laying the foundation for continued antiviral development (reviewed by Mesecar, Hilgenfeld, and their colleagues in this series). In this section, we will continue to focus on highlighting important cell based assays and techniques to efficiently identify and validate antiviral candidates against coronavirus replication.",

In this experiment, cell lysates were incubated with the tagged ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone, and any deubiquitinating enzyme will be covalently linked via the vinyl sulfone linkage to the tagged ubiquitin. These lysates can then be analyzed by western blot to determine if deubiquitinating enzyme binding to the ubiquitin vinyl-sulfone is affected in the presence of inhibitors.

The expression and activity of SARS-CoV PLpro within Sacchromyces cerevisiae led to a slow growth phenotype, and the basis for the screen was that inhibition of PLpro activity by small compounds could reverse this slow growth phenotype. Growth was measured by optical density, and from a 2000 compound library provided by the NIH, the authors generated candidate compounds that were then analyzed for their effect on PLpro expression or toxicity within S. cerevisiae. Based on these results, the authors further screened the compounds in VeroE6 and MA104 cells for activity against SARS-CoV replication. These compounds were also tested against three different activities of SARS-CoV papain-like protease. First, the drugs were tested for their ability to inhibit cleavage of a synthetic PLpro polyprotein substrate, nsp2\u20133, by SARS-CoV PLpro. This assay uses a tagged nsp2\u20133 and the cleavage product, which is dependent of PLpro catalytic activity, and can be visualized by western blot. The second assay uses the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro as a readout for PLpro activity and inhibition. Cells are transfected with PLpro and a tagged ubiquitin and then treated with inhibitors. PLpro will cleave the ubiquitin molecules, resulting in a decreased smear of ubiquitinated proteins and an increased smear if the inhibitors are blocking PLpro deubiquitinating activity. Finally, the authors assessed the ability of inhibitors to block the interferon antagonism properties of PLpro using an IFN\u03b2 luciferase assay. Cells transfected with either poly(I:C) or a constitutively active form of RIG-I, an IFN\u03b2 luciferase reporter, and PLpro, and then were treated with inhibitors. PLpro inhibits IFN\u03b2 promoter activation in response to stimulus, so if PLpro inhibitors block the ability of PLpro to inhibit IFN\u03b2 activation, an increase in IFN\u03b2 promoter activity will be seen. These cell based screening techniques are good tools to assess the mechanism of inhibitors and how they inhibit papain-like proteases within cells.

Modeling of SARS-CoV 3CLpro based on the structures of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and HCoV-229E 3CLpro presented the likelihood of structural conservation. Rhinoviral 3Cpro inhibitors bound efficiently to HCoV-229E 3CLpro, and were later shown to form complexes with SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Anand et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2003). Based on this biochemical characterization, and the enzymatic properties of proteases, much of the early work on 3CLpro inhibitors was performed in vitro in cell-free conditions. For example, Blanchard et al. used purified SARS-CoV 3CLpro and a FRET-based in vitro assay to screen a large compound library of compounds for 3CLpro inhibition (Blanchard et al., 2004). Multiple studies have used a live infection approach based on cell cytotoxicity, and then worked backwards from the hits to identify the mechanism of action of the identified inhibitors (Kao et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2004). Experiments like these are critical for the identification of lead compounds; however, cell-based assays designed to measure protease activity are needed to identify if these compounds could be efficacious in the context of viral infection.",

This involved the creation of an expression construct that encoded for SARS-CoV 3CLpro in frame with an inserted 3CLpro cleavage site (SAVLQSGFRK) and a downstream luciferase construct. The rationale for this design was the knowledge that when luciferase is fused to larger proteins, its activity is substantially decreased. Upon the cis cleavage of the 3CLpro-luciferase polyprotein, the liberated luciferase should give an increased signal. The authors demonstrated that this luciferase construct was not very active when translationally fused with a mutated 3CLpro cleavage site. When the cleavage site was intact they witnessed a 5\u201325-fold increase in luciferase activity. This assay was the first demonstration of a quantitative readout for 3CLpro activity when the protease is transiently expressed within cells.",

The entry of some coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, is known to be mediated by TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1). To determine if TMPRSS2 inhibition is a viable strategy to prevent MERS-CoV entry, Shirato et al. targeted TMPRSS2 activity with camostat and assessed the ability of MERS-CoV to cause syncytia and to enter cells using qRT-PCR for viral RNA. They demonstrated that inhibition of TMPRSS2 activity could inhibit MERS-CoV syncytia formation and that camostat, when combined with an inhibitor of cathepsin L (Fig. 1) potently inhibited MERS-CoV entry into cells (Shirato et al., 2013). These data represent the first chemical inhibition of MERS-CoV entry using infectious MERS-CoV by targeting host proteases. Targeting both the MERS-CoV S and receptor (CD26/DPP4) have been shown to be effective approaches, as Gao et al. designed viral fusion peptide inhibitors against the heptad repeat region HR2 of the MERS-CoV S and Ohnuma et al. created monoclonal antibodies against CD26 that were able to block MERS-CoV entry (Gao et al., 2013, Ohnuma et al., 2013).",

Many approaches rely on using infectious MERS-CoV as a way to determine if compounds had inhibitory effects. As MERS-CoV is highly pathogenic and is transmittable from human to human, all assays must be performed in a BSL-3 laboratory. So far, two approaches have been developed for assaying antiviral compounds at either the entry or viral protease stage of the MERS-CoV lifecycle without using infectious MERS-CoV. The first approach involves the familiar pseudotype assay that has been used to evaluate SARS-CoV entry inhibitors. Gierer et al. used VSV-luciferase pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV S to determine that MERS-CoV does not utilize any other coronaviral receptors, that TMPRSS2 and endosomal cathepsins facilitate viral entry, and that the S protein can be neutralized with MERS-CoV infected patient serum (Gierer et al., 2013). Zhao et al. also used pseudotyped virions, but for their experiments they utilized an HIV-luciferase virus pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S (Zhao et al., 2013). They used this system to also show that the S could be neutralized by antibodies and that a small-molecule inhibitor of HIV entry had inhibitory properties on the transduction of their pseudovirions.

These experiments utilized a circularly permuted luciferase construct with an inserted cleavage site corresponding to either the papain-like or 3C-like protease recognition sites. Expression vectors for both MERS-CoV PLpro and 3CLpro were able to cleave their respective biosensors when transfected together. An endpoint dual-luciferase assay with renilla luciferase as a transfection control and a live cell assay using a cell permeable luciferase substrate both showed luciferase activation when the MERS-CoV proteases were present. These assays were used to test previously identified SARS-CoV PLpro and 3CLpro inhibitors. The PLpro inhibitor had no effect on the activity of MERS-CoV PLpro, while the 3CLpro inhibitor CE-5 did show inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV 3CLpro. This was the first demonstration of an efficacious antiviral compound specific to a MERS-CoV enzyme, and will lead to SARS-CoV specific compounds being further tested. The applications of this assay are not limited to MERS-CoV, as the viral papain-like protease from SARS-CoV also activated the luciferase construct. This cell-based biosensor assay is especially useful as it can be used at BSL-2 level to study the effects of compound inhibitors on coronaviral proteases in the context of a host cell.",

            "text": "There are many challenges currently facing scientists who are developing coronaviral, and especially MERS-CoV, antiviral drugs. As highlighted above, there is a need for validated cell-based assays that can be used to accelerate antiviral compound discovery in the face of emerging coronavirus infections (Table 1). One issue with MERS-CoV antiviral design is that no suitable animal model exists. Rhesus macaques can be infected with MERS-CoV, exhibit symptoms, and respond to therapies (de Wit et al., 2013b, Falzarano et al., 2013, Munster et al., 2013); however, the symptoms are transient and do not completely reflect the severity of the disease in humans. Unlike SARS-CoV, de Wit et al. demonstrated that MERS-CoV does not establish a productive infection in Syrian hamsters (de Wit et al., 2013a). To date, there have been no published observations of MERS-CoV infection in small animal models, such as mice or ferrets. In addition, more work needs to be done to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors that would work against the common human coronaviral pathogens like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, or HCoV-HKU1. Development of inhibitors that also target these common viruses would allow for clinical trials on the effectiveness of antiviral drugs against endemic and possible emergent coronaviruses.",
