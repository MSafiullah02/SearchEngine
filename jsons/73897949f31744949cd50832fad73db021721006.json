In this study, we describe a hospital-based epidemiological study of hMPV in patients presenting to a children's hospital and show the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with hMPV infection in China, retrospectively. Specimens were collected over a 2-year period from children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) and analyzed for the presence of hMPV using real-time RT-PCR assays. The presence of hMPV was detected in 227 (25.9%) of the 878 children studied and may circulate year-round in the area, peaking during the winter-spring season. Younger children (aged less than 6 months) had the highest positive rate. Infections by hMPV showed similar epidemiology and clinical manifestations as for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and were found in high co-infections with RSV. Subgroup A2 hMPV was the most predominant genotype identified during the study period. This study indicates that hMPV is one of the major respiratory pathogens found in children in southwest China and vaccine development should be under consideration.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing countries. In children less than 5 years of age, respiratory tract infections rank second or third as the top causes of child death, regardless of geographic location. 1 Previous researches have demonstrated that human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus types A and B, and parainfluenza virus types 1-3, and adenoviruses are important causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in China. 2, 3 Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first isolated in 2001 from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) obtained from children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in the Netherlands. 4 Recently, it has been demonstrated that hMPV is a cause of respiratory tract infections with symptoms similar to those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The clinical disease spectrum caused by hMPV varies from upper respiratory tract infection to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children. Serological studies have shown that by 5 years of age, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to hMPV and that it has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years. 4 Consistent with previous studies, we found that the vast majority (90.3%) of children were seropositive to hMPV by the age of six in Chongqing, a large city located in Southwest China. 5 The high prevalence of hMPV indicates that it is an important respiratory pathogen in this temperate climate. A number of studies investigate the prevalence and clinical features of hMPV in China. 6, 7 As these studies were not consecutive, and have geographic differences, and the enrolled population was quite limited, the epidemiological picture of hMPV in this most populous country in the world remains unclear. Thus, ongoing epidemiological surveillance in a consecutive manner will help assess the disease burden and provide information for the development of a vaccine strategy against hMPV.",

The validated assay was then used to detect the presence of hMPV in NPAs from pediatric patients presenting at a large teaching children's hospital located in southwest China over a period of 2 years.

Yet, despite this knowledge, the epidemiological picture of hMPV infection in the most populous country in the world remains largely unknown due to the limits of these studies. 6, 7 The present study enrolled 878 pediatric patients with ALRTI who were admitted to Chongqing Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University over a 2-year period from April 2006 to March 2008. The enrolled patients accounted for a significant proportion of the total hospitalizations due to ALRTI during that period. Although we designed to enroll all newly admitted patients in three fixed days every week, the study results were not necessarily free from selection bias because we only collected NPAs in the daytime and some of the admitted patients refused to provide NPAs. The age, sex distribution and main clinical diagnoses between enrolled 878 patients in this study and the whole 6,296 admissions during the same period, though, was not statistically different, reflecting the selected subjects may thus be relatively representative. In previous studies of different ethnic and regional populations, the hMPV positive rate in NPAs from children with unknown etiology varied from 1.5% to 43%. 4, 9, [14] [15] [16] [17] The present study used real-time PCR targeting the hMPV F gene and found up to 25.9% of ALRTI could be attributed to hMPV infection from nonselected NPAs. The general prevalence of hMPV infection was relatively high as compared with some other regions, probably due to a higher population density in this city. Thus, hMPV appeared to cause a significant disease burden in Chongqing and was a common prevalent viral agent for ALRTI. Previous reports showed multivirus infections have a high occurrence in patients with ALRTI in china. 2, 3 In our study, hMPV co-infection with RSV was relatively common. The reason for high co-infection rate remains unclear by far, probably also partially due to a higher population density in this city.",

The Chinese spring festival may have an impact on the prevalence for February 2007 when many patients are not likely to be hospitalized. Limited sample collection is likely to reduce the reliability of prevalence rates. Previous studies found hMPV infection rate may vary greatly during the course of successive respiratory infection seasons. 9, 11, 17, 23 We also found a significant difference in the prevalence of hMPV infection in continuous 2 years, and the monthly prevalence of hMPV infection during the second year was higher than that during the first year, particularly in winter-spring seasons. The reason is not clear yet, while that may indicate hMPV has a periodic circulating pattern probably due to the immunity of the local population. Apparently, more data for a longer study period needed to elucidate the real pattern of hMPV circulation in this region.",

Comparison of the medical files of hMPVinfected children with those of RSV-infected children revealed that the clinical symptoms associated with these viruses were similar. This study found that a bulk of hMPV-infected children who received chest radiographs showed abnormalities such as pneumonia or pulmonary infiltration, hyperinflation, atelectasis, and pleural effusion. The main clinical diagnoses ranged from acute laryngotracheobronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. We found hMPV infection was related to wheezing, asthma exacerbations or bronchiolitis, as previous study described. 13, 23, 26, 27 Of 18 hMPV-positive cases with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, 11 (61.1%) were identified as a co-infection with RSV, indicating that hMPV and RSV co-infection may lead to a more severe disease than single infections. Nevertheless, in a larger number of patients with both hMPV and RSV, co-infection did not present as a severe condition for the duration of hospitalization. All hMPVpositive patients were unfortunately given antibiotics mainly because no etiological agent had been identified at the time of hospitalization. The majority of the hMPVpositive patients had corticosteroid and bronchodilators treatment for wheezing. These issues clearly reflect misuse of these medications. Application of reliable rapid diagnostics for not only hMPV but also for the common respiratory viruses may greatly help and be in priority.",

There is no report whether these genotypes represent distinct serotypes of hMPVor genetic variants of a prototype strain until now. Similar to RSV epidemics, 33 these findings indicate that hMPV from the two major groups could co-circulate in the population in the same period.

Among 227 hMPVpositive patients, two patients had recurrent respiratory tract infection and two patients had midrange malnutrition. It is noteworthy that 18 patients had serious respiratory failure and required supplemental oxygen and eleven (61.1%) of these had evidence of co-infection with hMPV and RSV. Two patients with serious respiratory failure were admitted to intensive care units and one patient required mechanical ventilation. All children with hMPV were given antibiotics during their hospitalization, however, not all patients had specimens collected for bacterial culture.
