Of note, hSIOs have allowed the first in vitro culturing of Norovirus (24). We exposed ileal hSIOs grown under four different culture conditions (\u2018EXP\u2019, \u2018DIF\u2019, \u2018DIF-BMP\u2019 and \u2018EEC\u2019) to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. hSIOs grown in Wnt-high expansion medium (EXP) overwhelmingly consist of stem cells and enterocyte progenitors. Organoids grown in differentiation medium (DIF) contain enterocytes, goblet cells, and low numbers of enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Addition of BMP2/4 to DIF (DIF-BMP) leads to further maturation (25). In the final condition, we induced expression of NeuroG3 from a stably transfected vector with doxycycline to raise EECs numbers (fig. S3D). Samples were harvested at multiple timepoints post infection and processed for the analyses given in Figs. 2 to 5. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hSIOs as assessed by qRT-PCR for viral sequences and by live virus titrations on VeroE6 cells (see Fig. 2 for lysed organoids and fig. S1 for organoid supernatant). Infectious virus particles and viral RNA increased to significant titers for both viruses in all conditions. Since EXP medium supported virus replication (Fig. 2, A and E), enterocyte progenitors appeared to be a primary viral target. Differentiated organoids (DIF; DIF-BMP) produced slightly (non-statistically significant) lower levels of infectious virus (Fig. 2 and fig. S1). In organoids induced to generate EECs, virus yields were similar to those in EXP medium (Fig. 2, D and H). In differentiated hSIOs, SARS-CoV-2 titers remained stable at 60 hours post infection, whereas SARS-CoV titers dropped 1-2 log (Fig. 2, B, C, F, and G). The latter decline was not observed in infected hSIOs grown in EXP. Culture supernatants across culture conditions contained lower levels of infectious virus compared to lysed hSIOs, implying that virus was primarily secreted apically (fig. S1, A to D). Despite this, viral RNA was detected readily in culture supernatants correlating with the infectious virus levels within hSIOs (Fig. 2, E to H, and fig. S1, E to H).",

We stained for viral dsRNA, viral nucleocapsid protein, KI67 to visualize proliferative cells, actin (using phalloidin) to visualize enterocyte brush borders, DNA (DAPI) and cleaved caspase 3 to visualize apoptotic cells. Generally, comparable rates of viral infections were observed in the organoids growing in all three conditions. We typically noted staining for viral components (white) in rare, single cells at 24 hours. At 60 hours, the number of infected cells had dramatically increased (Fig. 3A). Infected cells invariably displayed proliferative enterocyte progenitor-phenotypes (EXP; Fig. 3B, top) or ApoA1+ enterocyte-phenotypes (DIF; Fig. 3B, bottom). Of note, SARS-CoV also readily infected enterocyte lineage cells (fig. S3, A and B) as shown previously (26, 27). Some infected enterocyte progenitors were in mitosis (fig. S3C). Whereas EEC-organoids produced appreciable titers, we never observed infection of Chromogranin-A+ EECs (fig. S3, D and E). We also did not notice infection of Goblet cells across culture conditions. At 60 hours, apoptosis became prominent in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected enterocytes (fig. S5). ACE2 protein was readily revealed as a bright and ubiquitous brush border marker in hSIOs in DIF medium (Fig. 3C). In hSIOs in EXP medium, ACE2 staining was much lower -yet still apical- in occasional cells in a subset of organoids that displayed a more mature morphology (Fig. 3C). In immature (cystic) organoids within the same cultures, the ACE2 signal was below the detection threshold. The percentage of infected organoids under EXP and DIF conditions are given in fig. S4. Figure S5 shows images and quantification of apoptotic cells upon infection.",

Viral particles of 80-120 nm occurred in the lumen of the organoid (Fig. 4I), at the basolateral (Fig. 4J) and apical side (Fig. 4K) of enterocytes. The double-membrane vesicles which are the subcellular site of viral replication (29) are visualized in Fig. 4, E and P. The nuclei in both organoids differed from nuclei in mock-infected organoids by a slightly rounder shape. The nuclear contour index (30) was 4.0+/\u22120.5 vs 4.3+/\u22120.5 for control set. There was more heterochromatin (4N), and one or two dense nucleoli in the center (4O).",

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited a broad signature of cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) attributed to type I and III interferon responses (Fig. 5A and tables S1 and S2), as confirmed by Gene Ontology analysis (Fig. 5B). An overlapping list of genes appeared in SARS-CoV-2-infected DIF organoids (fig. S6 and table S3). RNA sequencing analysis confirmed differentiation of DIF organoids into multiple intestinal lineages, including ACE2 up-regulation (fig. S7). SARS-CoV also induced ISGs, yet to a much lower level (table S4). Figure 5C visualizes the regulation of SARS-CoV-2-induced genes in SARS-CoV infected organoids. This induction was similar to infections with other viruses like norovirus (31), rotavirus (32) and enteroviruses (33, 34). A recent study (35) describes an antiviral signature induced in human cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whereas the ISG response is broader in intestinal organoids, the induced gene sets are in close agreement between the two datasets (fig. S8). One striking similarity was the low expression of Type I and III interferons: we only noticed a small induction of the Type III interferon IFNL1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected organoids. In SARS-CoV-infected organoids, we did not observe any type I or type III interferon induction. We confirmed these findings by ELISA on culture supernatant and qRT-PCR, which in addition to IFNL1 picked up low levels of type I interferon IFNB1 in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV infected organoids (fig. S9). The specific induction of IP-10/CXCL10 and ISG15 by SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed by ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively (fig. S10). As in (35), a short list of cytokine genes was induced by both viruses albeit it to modest levels. For a comparison with (35), see fig. S11. Altogether these data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a stronger interferon response than SARS-CoV in HIOs.",

A limited, qualitative experiment applying confocal analysis demonstrated infectability of two other lines available in the lab (one ileal, one duodenal) from independent donors (fig. S13). This study shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infect enterocyte lineage cells in a human intestinal organoid model. We observed similar infection rates of enterocyte-precursors and enterocytes whereas ACE2 expression increases ~1000-fold upon differentiation at the mRNA level (fig. S2).
