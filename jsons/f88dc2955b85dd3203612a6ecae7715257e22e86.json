During the acute stage of neurologic disease following intracerebral inoculation, Junin antigen was detected in 100% of animals, strongly in most neurons but also to a much lesser degree in scattered astrocytes, dropping to 20% of rats at 540 days postinfection. Initially labeled in all brain areas, viral antigen gradually disappeared from hippocampus but persisted irregularly in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, Purkinje cells, pons, and medulla oblongata. Such a pattern suggests that specific neuronal subpopulations, in spite of apparently unaltered cell morphology, may persistently harbor the virus, leading on occasion to a delayed neurologic syndrome. During both the acute and chronic stages of disease, a mild inflammatory exudate was observed, characterized by the presence of T and B lymphocytes, as well as macrophages and unidentified round cells. GFAP immunostaining showed increased astrocytic reaction as infection lapsed into chronicity. Corpus callosum, hippocampus, and cerebellum exhibited the sharpest reactive astrocytosis, followed by basal ganglia, pons, and medulla oblongata, whereas in cerebral cortex it was considerably less. Astrocyte activation, which failed to correlate with viral antigen presence in neurons, seems to result from a generalized condition, possibly including diffusible brain factors triggered by viral infection. Such widespread astroglial reaction may thus contribute to the outcome of the late neurologic syndrome.",

Solutions for the silver impregnation method comprised 1) 2% aqueous potassium bichromate; 2) 1% aqueous silver nitrate plus 0.4% aqueous potassium carbonate, and the resulting precipitate just dissolved by dropwise addition of ammonium hydroxide; and 3) 0.25% ( w h ) gelatin dispersed in warm distilled water followed by addition of 10% paraformaldehyde. The steps for staining were as follows: 1) Samples were deparafflnized, hydrated, and sensitized with potassium bichromate solution for 2 min; 2) preparations were washed several times in distilled water; 3) one drop of pure pyridine was add-ed for each milliliter of filtered silver solution and then used to impregnate samples at 60\u00b0C for 15 min; and 4) Formalin-gelatin mixture was employed to reduce silver, the reaction left to rest for 10 min.

Table I summarizes findings from virus antigen-PAP immunostaining, gradually dropping to 2/10 at phages, together with a few B lymphocytes and a variable number of unidentified round cells. This immunoperoxidase profile persisted until the very end of the observation period. Table I1 outlines the results of GFAP immunostaining and also staining by the PAP technique. Degrees of astrocytic reaction degree, which increased wth the successive stages of the disease, are depicted. Specifically, the cell activation, representing faster morphologic and immunocytochemical maturation versus control animals, featured hyperplasia and hypertrophy of cell bodies and processes. As from the onset, cerebellum exhibited sharp GFAP staining of astrocytes and of Bergmann fibers (Fig. 4a) . Although the glial reaction was less evident in basal ganglia, isolated cell areas of strong labeling were observed (Fig. 4b) . On occasion, foci of bizarre astrocytes were seen throughout the brain, including the thalamus (Fig. 4c) . Toward the end of the observation period, Bergmann fibers gradually stained even more heavily for GFAP (Fig. 4d) . Hyperplasia and hypertrophy were often depicted by a n increase in number and size of vascular end-feet, making up a sharp continuous border. Furthermore, a few degenerative foci appeared as from 30 days pi, represented by amorphous GFAP-positive masses or granules scattered within brain tissues. Table I1 also shows that the corpus callosum, hippocampus, and cerebellum had the sharpest astrocytic activation, followed by basal ganglia, pons, and medulla oblongata, whereas in cerebral cortex glial reaction was considerably weaker. slight staining of axons surrounding neurons and glial cells; 540 days pi.

The selective vulnerability of neuronal subpopulations t o viral infections has been reported for many RNA viruses [Kristensson and Norrby, 19861 , and, by comparing immunocytochemical findings to date, Purkinje cells stand out as a peculiar reservoir for persistent infection by virus such as JHM [Sorensen and Dales, 19851, human coronavirus [Pearson and Mims, 19831 , and reovirus type 3 [Spriggs et al., 19831 . It should be emphasized that the longlasting detection of Junin virus antigen observed in cerebral cortex neurons and in Purkinje cells has also been described for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [Rodriguez et al., 19831 , prototype of the Arenaviridae family to which Junin virus belongs. In our rat model, viral antigen was located mainly in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in astrocytes, closely paralleling a feature previously described for the mouse [Lascano and Berria, 19831 . Actually, neurons and astrocytes are precisely the two CNS cell types in which budding of and Berria, 19741 . Another pattern common to both animal models is that Junin antigen, though distributed all over the cytoplasm, was mostly concentrated at the cell periphery, where viral particle budding invariably takes place. Inflammatory infiltrate was mild throughout, in sharp contrast with the plentiful exudate observed in rat for the XJ-C1, strain [Lascano et al., 19861 . As regards its immunocytochemical profile, it agreed with the unique CNS features delineated by Griffin et al. [ 19871 in other experimental viral encephalitis diseases such as those induced by Sindbis and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses.",

            "text": "It is known that the astrocytic response to CNS injury is stereotyped, unidirectional, and characterized by proliferation [Latov et al., 19791, hypertrophy, and appearance of large quantitites of GFAP [Amaducci et al., 1981; Bignami and Dahl, 19761 . As a general rule, the intensity of the glial reaction is directly related to the proximity of the injury site [Eng and DeArmond, 1982J . However, in the present case, a comparison of the data given in Tables I and I1 indicates that there is no topographical relationship between viral antigen location in neurons and astrocytic activation detected by GFAP labeling. In fact, the hippocampus was Junin antigen free from 82 days pi, but this was the very area where astrocytic hyperplasia and hypertrophy reached a considerable degree. Conversely, during persistent infection, viral antigen was frequently detected in cerebral cortex neurons, where astrocytic activation was manifested to a lesser extent. Furthermore, at 280 and 450 days pi, there was a single case out of 10 animals that exhibited viral antigen in brain, although all rats presented a similar degree of astrocytic reaction. Resorting to in vitro systems [Berrla and Lascano, 19851, a direct Junin virus effect has been demonstrated on rat astroglial cell cultures, consisting of the induction of morphological and immunocytochemical differentiation. However, in the present model, the number of Junin antigen-labeled astrocytes in the whole animal was considerably lower that the number of activated astrocytes. Moreover, the gradual viral antigen restriction in neurons during the chronic stage was concomitant with widespread astrocytic reaction. Thus, the presence of viral antigen in both astrocytes and neurons seems unrelated to reactive astrocytosis.",

Although complete information is still lacking about the triggering of glial reaction [Reier, 19861, several substances have been identified that may induce astrocyte proliferation or differentiation [Lindsay, 19861 , such as glia maturation factors present in brain tissues [Kato et al., 1981; Nieto-Sampedro et al., 1985; Pettmann et al., 1980; Sobue and Pleasure, 19841 and possibly released from damaged neurons, as well as from demyelinated areas [Kristensson et al., 19861 . Glial reaction has also been attributed to lymphokines produced by viral antigen-stimulated perivascular lymphocytes [Oldstone et al., 19861 or to direct effects caused by the infective agent itself [Manuelidis et al., 19871. Recent evidence has been presented that viral infection can impair neuronal activity even in the absence of histologic injury ILipkin et al., 19881. Although consistent morphologic changes were lacking in Junin antigen-labeled neurons, it is probable that cell infection can induce the release of mitogenic and morphogenic factors. Understandably, since the astrocyte is the most abundant neuroectodermal cell of the brain, its reactivity seems the most obvious histologic expression of Junin virus persistent infection. It may therefore be concluded that the indiscriminate and detrimental astrocytic activation is a contributory factor to the pathogenesis of the delayed neurologic disease observed in the adult rat. The present findings encourage further studies that include the identification of the astrocyte subtypes [Miller and Raff, 1984; Takamiya et al., 19881 that are involved in such glial reaction. It seems reasonable to assume the existence of regional differences in the astrocytic response to persistent viral infection of the CNS.",
