Although vaccines have been developed and licensed for prevention of many of these diseases, there is a need for improvement in vaccine efficacy and for new vaccines. Reasons for low vaccine efficacy include inappropriate, unstable, or outdated antigens in vaccine preparations (e.g., in vitro expressed antigens instead of in vivo expressed antigens), inappropriate immune responses (e.g., systemic instead of mucosal, or Th2 type instead of Th1 type or vise versa), and inappropriate use of otherwise efficacious vaccines (e.g., inappropriate timing of vaccination) (Tizard, 2013). An overview of some of the vaccines currently licensed for vaccination of domesticated animals and wildlife by mucosal routes is provided in Table 1\n. Many of these vaccines consist of pathogens attenuated by traditional methods, but engineered virus-vectored vaccines are now used extensively (by both mucosal and parenteral routes) in veterinary medicine.",

Improved protective efficacy and rapid onset of immunity compared to killed vaccine products have led to widespread acceptance. Attenuated live oral vaccines for enteric diseases have also been marketed, but in many cases efficacy has been disappointing due to lack of potency in adults or interference by maternal antibodies in suckling animals. Better strategies for induction of immunity in the gastrointestinal tract are needed, especially for neonates in the presence of maternal antibodies. In contrast, effective parenteral vaccines for the most common diseases of the reproductive tract in veterinary species have been available for years, and there has been little motivation to develop mucosal vaccines.",

For these diseases active immunization may not provide protection before natural exposure to the pathogen. Maternal vaccination to enhance passive immunity has been widely used in veterinary medicine, especially for control of enteric diseases. Practical difficulties arise, however, with diseases such as parvovirus enteritis in puppies in which a smooth transition must be made from protection by passive maternal antibodies to protection by active immunity, without permitting a window in between of disease susceptibility. This transition is difficult to achieve because induction of active immunity is commonly inhibited by maternal antibodies. Various strategies are used to address this problem, but improved vaccines, adjuvants, and antigen delivery systems would improve the reliability of neonatal immunization.",

Disease conditions are intensified by current management practices such as mixing of recently weaned, stressed beef calves from multiple sources in auction barns. Certain disease conditions, such as atrophic rhinitis of pigs, result from the interplay of several pathogens, and multiple agents must be represented in vaccines. Some respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in young pigs are causing new patterns of disease as management practices change (e.g., weaning at an earlier age), requiring changes in vaccine strategies. Other pathogens such as PRRSV have only recently emerged and improved vaccines await advances in understanding of the agent and of disease pathogenesis. A discussion of respiratory vaccines for even the major pathogens of veterinary species is beyond the scope of the present review. This section will focus on vaccines for PRRSV infections in pigs and influenza in horses to illustrate general principles.",

Signs associated with PRRS are anorexia, fever, lethargy, pneumonia, red/blue discoloration of the ears and vulva, delayed return of sows to estrus after weaning, abortion, fetal mummification, stillborn or weak born piglets, and high preweaning mortality (Mengeling et al., 1998). PRRSV is prevalent in swine-producing countries worldwide. Annual economic losses to the pork industry in the United States due to PRRS have been estimated at $664 million (Holtkamp and Kliebenstein, 2011). According to the American Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) report of January 2009, 49.8% of unvaccinated pigs in the United States are seropositive to PRRSV. Infected pigs excrete PRRSV in saliva, nasal secretions, urine, milk, colostrum, and feces at low levels or intermittently, and also in semen of infected boars (Rossow et al., 1994). In the absence of control measures, PRRSV is spread by aerosols, fomites, and personnel.",

Induction of IL-10 is mediated by interaction between PRRSV proteins and M\u03a6s/dendritic cells (DCs). The PRRSV nucleocapsid protein induces IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and alveolar M\u03a6s (Wongyanin et al., 2012), delaying the onset of protective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to PRRSV (Dwivedi et al., 2011a, Dwivedi et al., 2012). Dysregulated immune responses in infected pigs affect viral pathogenesis, disease severity, and susceptibility to secondary microbial infections (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001, Renukaradhya et al., 2010). Immune responses against PRRSV are inadequate to completely clear the virus. Viremia disappears in 4\u20136 weeks, but the virus persists in the tonsils and lymphoid tissues for several months (Moyron-Quiroz et al., 2007). PRRSV infection in both germ-free and conventionally raised pigs is associated with polyclonal B cell activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphoid adenopathy, renal lesions, and lymphoid hyperplasia (Cooper et al., 1997). Polyclonal lymphoplasia also occurs in mice infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, a related virus (Grossmann et al., 1989). Primary antibody responses occur promptly after PRRSV infection (Loemba et al., 1996), but the majority of secreted antibodies are autoantibodies or PRRSV nonneutralizing antibodies (Lemke et al., 2004). The virus-neutralizing antibody (NA) response is weak, and delayed (Mateu et al., 2006).",

There are numerous reports of reversion of PRRSV vaccine virus to virulence and of the presence of reverted vaccine strain PRRSV in unvaccinated sows and pigs (Nielsen et al., 2002). Vaccine-derived virus has been isolated from fetuses, stillborn, and dead piglets, indicating the spread of disease from vaccinated pigs.

Control of PRRSV in breeding stock is critical in preventing vertical and horizontal transmission of the virus. Early attempts to develop killed PRRSV vaccines using recombinant PRRSV proteins, plasmids expressing viral genes, and inactivated PRRSV administered with or without adjuvants have been unsuccessful (Charerntantanakul, 2009). However, recent studies show promise. Killed PRRSV vaccine coadministered IN with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant (a TLR-9 ligand) induced antibodies, virus-specific T cells, and secretion of IFN\u03b3 and IL-6 (Zhang et al., 2007). In another study, PRRSV inactivated by UV light or binary ethylenimine induced NA and protected pigs against homologous viral challenge. The suppressive effect of live PRRSV on IFN\u03b1 production was lost when the virus was inactivated by UV irradiation (Vanhee et al., 2009). An oral immunization strategy using PRRSV nucleocapsid protein genetically fused to cholera toxin (CT) stimulated PRRSV antibody responses in the intestines, but no detectable response in vaginal secretions (Hyland et al., 2004).",

IN-delivered, potent mucosal vaccines generate better cross-protective immunity against genetically variable PRRSV field viruses. Efforts to control PRRS outbreaks using conventional parenterally delivered vaccines have had limited success; development of an alternative approach of generating immunity in the respiratory tract should be a priority.

For some complex disease conditions (e.g., bovine respiratory disease complex) there is continuing uncertainty whether all of the relevant contributing pathogens have been identified. Although many parenteral vaccines are efficacious in reducing lower respiratory tract disease, there is a need to investigate whether induction of mucosal immunity in the upper airways, in combination with systemic immunity, can further reduce infection rates, transmission of pathogens, and economic losses. Finally, there is a need to devise and implement changes in management procedures to reduce disease exposure (by nonimmunological methods), and to optimize immune interventions by improved timing of vaccinations.",

Several hematogenous infections have a predilection for the gravid uterus resulting in early to late abortions (Corbeil et al., 2001). These include leptospirosis, chlamydial infection, and brucellosis in several animal species, Histophilus somni infection in cattle and sheep and Neospora caninum in cattle. Although vaccines are available for several of these infections, the vaccine for brucellosis has been available since the 1940s and is the most well known. Several Brucella species cause abortion or epididymitis/orchitis in the primary hosts (Brucella abortus in cattle, Brucella suis in swine, Brucella melitensis in goats, Brucella ovis in sheep, Brucella canis in dogs, and Brucella marinum (or Brucella delphini) in marine mammals). Infection may be acquired via the gut mucosa or the conjunctiva/upper respiratory mucosa and localizes in the reticuloendothelial system and endometrium/placenta by systemic spread. Thus, systemic vaccines are effective. A modified live B. abortus vaccine, along with a \u201ctest and slaughter\u201d eradication program, has been successful in controlling bovine brucellosis in North America. The modified live vaccine (B. abortus strain 19) is very effective in stimulating CMI that is critical for protection against this facultative intracellular pathogen. Strain 19 now has been largely replaced by a new attenuated strain, RB51, which does not stimulate an antibody response known to interfere with diagnostic serologic assays. There is considerable information on mechanisms of systemic immunity to brucellosis. Neospora caninum also causes abortion by a hematogenous route and a vaccine is available (Weston et al., 2012). Histophilus somni can infect either by the hematogenous route or by an ascending genital route to cause abortion or infertility and vaccines are available. Since the focus of this volume is mucosal immunity, no more will be said concerning protection against hematogenous infections of the genital tract.\n",

After months of infection, the uterus is cleared first, followed by the vagina. Convalescent immunity is partially protective for a limited time. Antibody is effective in protection against this extracellular pathogen as demonstrated by systemic passive immunization (Berg et al., 1979). The antibody response to infection is primarily IgA in the vagina and IgG in the uterus (Corbeil et al., 1981). Systemic immunization with a whole cell vaccine results in both IgG1 and IgG2 antibody responses to surface antigen in serum, and uterine and vaginal secretions (Corbeil et al., 1981). This response prevents infection and can rapidly clear infected cows (Corbeil and Winter, 1978). That is, the vaccine can be used prophylactically and even therapeutically. Immunization is efficacious even though surface antigenic variation occurs in the face of a local immune response (Corbeil and Winter, 1978). Presumably, immune clearance occurs when the dynamic interaction between protection and evasion is shifted in the favor of the host. This appears to occur earlier when the response is primarily IgG than when IgA predominates (Corbeil et al., 1981). This may be related to the ability of the IgG antibodies to mediate opsonization and intracellular killing of the bacterium, an ability which IgA antibodies lack (Corbeil and Winter, 1978). Although this work was done many years ago, it sets a precedent for systemic immunization for prophylaxis and therapy of reproductive mucosal infections.",

            "text": "Trichomoniasis is a similar chronic genital mucosal infection of cattle. It is caused by the protozoan, T. foetus, and results in pregnancy loss. Trichomonas vaginalis causes a human STD also associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Thus, bovine trichomoniasis serves as a model for immune prevention of both bovine and human reproductive mucosal infections. Because of the economic significance of bovine trichomoniasis and because no chemotherapy is approved, investigations have focused on immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy. T. foetus colonizes the vaginal and uterine or preputial surfaces for months, like C. fetus subsp. venerealis infection. In fact, mature bulls are often infected for life whereas young bulls may clear the infection with time (Cobo et al., 2011). This is probably related to innate immunity. Trichomonads are anaerobic parasites and are found deep in uterine glands and epithelial crypts of the penis and prepuce (Rhyan et al., 1999) where the oxygen tension is probably lowest. Older bulls have deeper epithelial crypts, which may have lower oxygen tension. In order to understand protective acquired immune responses, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with putative protective functions were chosen for immunoaffinity purification of a highly glycosylated surface antigen (BonDurant et al., 1993, Corbeil et al., 2001). Analysis of many isolates of T. foetus indicated that two mAbs recognized different epitopes of the same antigen, which was conserved in all isolates tested. This glycosylated surface antigen was later shown to be a lipophosphoglycan (LPG)/protein complex. Systemic immunization with the immunoaffinity-purified LPG-containing surface antigen, followed by intravaginal challenge with T. foetus, resulted in significantly earlier clearance of the parasite from vaccinated animals than from controls (BonDurant et al., 1993, Corbeil et al., 2001). More importantly, clearance of immunized animals most often occurred before 7 weeks of infection. Parsonson et al. (1976) showed that significant inflammation accompanied by reproductive failure did not occur until after 7 weeks of infection, so the vaccine should protect against fetal loss. Analysis of vaccine-induced antibody responses demonstrated predominantly IgG1 responses in the serum and IgA plus IgG1 antibodies in secretions (Corbeil et al., 2001, Corbeil et al., 2005). IgE antibodies were also increased during infection. As IgE antibodies increased, mast cells degranulated and clearance of T. foetus occurred. These studies raised several questions. First, why is the systemic response to the LPG/protein complex skewed toward IgG1 (a Th2 response in cattle) and not IgG2 (a Th1 response)? This question is under investigation. Second, are IgG or IgA antibodies to the LPG-containing antigen most protective and how can that Ig isotype be enriched to enhance protection? To address the latter questions, preliminary studies were done in mice to determine the best routes and adjuvants to enrich for IgG or IgA in genital secretions (Corbeil et al., 2001). Subcutaneous priming with the immunoaffinity-purified LPG-containing surface antigen (called TF1.17 antigen) in Quil A adjuvant and subcutaneous boosting with whole cells enriched for IgG anti-TF1.17 antibodies in genital secretions whereas subcutaneous priming and intravaginal boosting greatly enriched for IgA antibodies in genital secretions. When cattle immunized by these two methods were challenged intravaginally with T. foetus, those with predominantly IgA or predominantly IgG1 anti-TF1.17 antibodies in genital secretions were equally protected. Later studies with similar IN immunizations showed that stimulation of the common mucosal immune system gave results similar to those of intravaginal immunization (Corbeil et al., 2001). This raised the question of inductive sites for local immune responses in the genital tract. Others have suggested that the genital tract is not an inductive site because M cells and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) are not present. This is true of cattle as well as mice and people. However, even though control cows did not have histologically demonstrable MALT in the uterus and vagina, cows experimentally infected with T. foetus did (Corbeil et al., 2001). Similar lymphoid nodules and follicles under a modified epithelium were detected in preputial and penial surfaces of bulls infected with T. foetus (Rhyan et al., 1999). Immunostaining of parallel sections with mAb to TF1.17 antigen indicated uptake of antigen by epithelial cells and large M\u03a6 or DC under the basement membrane near the lymphoid follicles (Rhyan et al., 1999). Similar antigen uptake has been detected in the infected female uterine and vaginal mucosa (Corbeil et al., 2005). Thus, even though the parasite is noninvasive, released TF1.17 antigen appears to be taken up by epithelial cells. Rat uterine epithelial cells can present antigen to T helper cells (Wira and Rossol, 1995). Also, M\u03a6/DC positive for antigen should be antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Detection of IgG1 and IgA antibodies in genital secretions of infected bulls (Cobo et al., 2010, Rhyan et al., 1999) and cows (Corbeil et al., 2001) and the histologic demonstration of follicles and putative APCs suggests that inductive sites in the genital tract are formed in response to antigenic stimulation.",

            "text": "Like C. fetus subsp. venerealis, T. foetus has mechanisms for evasion of immune responses. These include coating of the surface with Ig nonspecifically (Corbeil et al., 1991), epitope variation (Ikeda et al., 1993), and cleavage of IgG1, IgG2, and complement component 3 by extracellular cysteine proteinase (Talbot et al., 1991, Kania et al., 2001). Studies with cysteine proteinase inhibitors demonstrated decreased cytotoxicity of T. foetus for bovine trophoblast cells and decreased infectivity in a mouse model, confirming the likely role of cysteine proteinases in pathogenesis (Cobo et al., 2012). Even with these mechanisms for immune evasion, as with C. fetus, it is clear that the dynamic interaction between host and parasite can be made to favor the host by systemic or local immunization. The usefulness of whole cell vaccines in preventing T. foetus infection and reproductive failure in cows has been demonstrated in clinical trials (Kvasnicka et al., 1992). First-generation whole cell vaccines are now commercially available for prevention of trichomoniasis in cows. Earlier, Clark et al. (1984) demonstrated efficacious immunization of bulls with whole T. foetus cells or crude membrane glycoproteins that probably contained TF1.17 antigen. This study indicated that vaccination of bulls could both prevent infection and clear already established infection. So vaccines for bovine trichomoniasis are both immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic. Recent studies showed that vaccination of bulls with a commercially available whole cell killed T. foetus vaccine in oil adjuvant resulted in protection against challenge and high levels of IgG antibodies in serum and preputial secretions (Cobo et al., 2010). IgG1 antibodies to whole cell T. foetus antigens predominated but fairly high levels of IgG2 antibodies were also detected.",

Either systemic immunization or mucosal (IN or intravaginal) immunization with systemic boosting is protective.3.Inductive sites are formed in the mucosa of infected male and female genital tracts even with noninvasive pathogens.4.Strong and appropriate immune responses will clear microbial infection from the genital tract even when the microbe has multiple immune evasive mechanisms.5.The fact that protection against two STDs has been demonstrated in the natural outbred host (cattle) has advantages over murine models of STD vaccines. In the latter, the human pathogen is usually inoculated into the unnatural murine host and the disease does not mimic the human infection. Furthermore, although inbred mice provide a homogeneous experimental animal, they do not represent the variation in immune responses seen in the outbred human population. The work on bovine vibriosis and trichomoniasis demonstrates protection under field conditions for two STDs that cause adverse pregnancy outcome in an outbred host.

Agents causing diarrhea in animals include viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, pestiviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, parvoviruses, rotaviruses, toroviruses), bacteria (e.g., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp., diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp.), and parasites (e.g., Coccidia spp., Cryptosporidium parvum). These infections occur most commonly in suckling animals or in poultry under 3 weeks of age, but may also be common postweaning and in susceptible seronegative or stressed adult animals (Saif and Jackwood, 1990). Induction of local secretory IgA (S-IgA) antibodies (prevent attachment, invasion, and neutralize toxins or infectious agent) and mucosal cellular immune responses (against intracellular bacteria and viruses) by vaccines are essential for protection from enteric pathogens. Peyer\u2019s patches (PP) and mesenteric lymph nodes are two important organized gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) in domestic animals and serve as the induction site for gut immune responses. Ileal PP in some domestic animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs) differ from jejunal PP, serving as a primary lymphoid organ similar to the bursa of Fabricius in chickens, unlike in humans and rodents where PP are secondary lymphoid organs (Chu and Liu, 1984, Yasuda et al., 2006). Cryptopatches or clusters of lymphoid cells in the basal lamina propria occur in mice, but are absent in pigs (Pabst et al., 2005). Mucosal lymphoid tissues and lymphoid cells in domestic animals and humans differ in Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and function (after binding their ligand) when compared to mice (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004, Tohno et al., 2006, Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004). These differences in immune components suggest that vaccine studies carried out in mice may fail to translate to domestic animals or humans.",

Enteric viruses have predilections for replication in distinct vertical and longitudinal regions of the small or large intestines. Cytolytic infection of enterocytes leads to varying degrees of villous loss and fusion, reduced small intestinal absorptive capacity, and a malabsorptive, maldigestive diarrhea (Saif, 1999a). Secretory diarrhea is also induced by some viruses such as rotavirus (RV), which involves the viral enterotoxin, nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), and/or stimulation of the enteric nervous system (Ball et al., 1996, Lundgren et al., 2000). Thus, viral diarrheas can be of variable severity and act via multiple mechanisms that differ from those of enteric bacteria, most of which cause secretory diarrhea mediated by enterotoxins (Fairbrother and Gyles, 2006).",

Although a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality was observed in a field trial among vaccinated calves, in the majority of herds (compared to previous years), subsequent field studies revealed variable efficacy.

Gnotobiotic pigs are free of maternal antibodies (placental transfer of Igs does not occur in swine), but they are immunocompetent at birth. They are maintained aseptically and are free of exposure to extraneous wildtype RVs, assuring that exposure to a single pathogen can be analyzed. Initial studies were conducted to mimic natural RV infection (Bohl et al., 1984) and to study immune correlates of protection (Saif et al., 1996, Gonzalez et al., 2008, Yuan et al., 2008). Understanding the sequence and kinetics of immune responses stimulated by virulent RVs allows for the determination of markers of protective immunity and pathogenicity, which can then be used to design vaccines that will stimulate protective immunity without inducing pathology. Gnotobiotic pigs orally inoculated with virulent porcine or human RVs were completely protected from homotypic but not heterotypic (distinct G/P types) RV challenge (Hoshino et al., 1988, Saif et al., 1997). Significant correlations were observed between the protection to RV-induced diarrhea and shedding and the following immune parameters: the number of intestinal IgA RV antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), serum and intestinal IgA RV antibody titers, and the frequency of intestinal RV-specific IFN\u03b3 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Saif et al., 1996, Yuan et al., 1996, To et al., 1998, Yuan and Saif, 2002, Yuan et al., 2008). These immune parameters were significantly higher in virulent RV inoculated pigs than in those inoculated with attenuated or inactivated RV (Ward et al., 1996b). Pigs inoculated with two or three doses of attenuated RV were moderately protected against diarrhea (62%-3 doses, 44%-2 doses) and virus shedding (67%-3 doses and 19%-2 doses) after homotypic challenge, suggesting a need for multiple doses and suitable mucosal adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of RV vaccines (Saif et al., 1996, Yuan et al., 1996, Yuan et al., 2001, Yuan and Saif, 2002).",

Gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with one dose of attenuated RV showed lower early IFN\u03b3 and proinflammatory cytokine responses compared to virulent RV inoculated pigs. Both attenuated and virulent RV inoculated pigs developed Th1/Th2/Tr1 cytokine-secreting cell (CSC) responses at 2\u20134 weeks postinoculation; however, attenuated RV inoculated pigs developed lower intestinal IFN\u03b3 and higher intestinal and splenic IL-10 CSCs compared to virulent HRV inoculated pigs (Azevedo et al., 2006). Virulent RV inoculated pigs had significantly higher protection rates against RV challenge (87% and 100% against diarrhea and shedding, respectively) compared to one dose of attenuated RV inoculated pigs (0% and 14% against diarrhea and shedding, respectively) (Azevedo et al., 2006). These findings suggest that higher protection rates are associated with early proinflammatory and Th1 cytokine responses, which promote cytotoxic T cell activity and viral clearance, and later Th2 induced cytokines, which are important for protective S-IgA antibody responses. Thus, protection against RV in pigs requires balanced Th1/Th2/Treg responses (Azevedo et al., 2006, Gonzalez et al., 2008). Infection of gnotobiotic pigs with virulent RV causes early recruitment of innate APCs (monocytes/M\u03a6 and DCs) and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells into the ileum, and enhanced TLR2, TLR3, and TLR9 expression among APCs in spleen (Zhang et al., 2008c, Wen et al., 2009, Wen et al., 2011). In virulent RV-infected pigs, plasmacytoid DCs are major producers of serum IFN\u03b1 and, along with other innate immune cells (\u03b3\u03b4 T cells and APCs) and cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 and IL-12), are important for controlling early RV viral replication and subsequent development of protective adaptive immune responses (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Development of attenuated RV vaccines with mucosal adjuvants that mimic immune responses to virulent RV may improve existing vaccines.",

Inactivated oral or intramuscular RV vaccines failed to protect against virulent RV challenge, despite high IgG antibody responses induced in serum and systemic lymphoid tissues. Serum IgG antibodies did not correlate with protection. However, a recent study showed that an inactivated reassortant RV strain (CDC-9 strain) formulated with aluminum phosphate and administered systemically in gnotobiotic pigs resulted in induction of serum IgG antibody titers, coinciding with partial protection against shedding and diarrhea, suggesting that adjuvant may have stimulated local specific (gut IgA antibodies) or nonspecific immune responses, which were not assessed in this study (Wang et al., 2010). Rotavirus subunit vaccines consisting of double-layered VLP composed of RV inner capsid proteins VP2 and VP6 (2/6-VLPs) administered IN or orally with mutant heat-labile toxin of E. coli (mLT) or ISCOMs as adjuvants (Yuan and Saif, 2002) induced IgG ASC responses in systemic lymphoid tissues and low or no IgA ASC responses in intestinal lymphoid tissues and also failed to mediate protection, contrary to results in adult mouse studies (Yuan and Saif, 2002). The failure of IN or oral 2/6-VLP vaccines suggests that protective immunity to RV diarrhea in neonatal pigs requires mainly the presence of systemic or intestinal IgA antibodies to the outer capsid RV proteins, VP4 and VP7, each of which induces NA.",

            "text": "However, when 2/6-VLPs adjuvanted with mLT or ISCOM were used as IN or oral booster doses in pigs orally primed with attenuated RV, the protective efficacy increased significantly. An oral attenuated RV prime and IN 2/6-VLP-ISCOM boost regimen (AttRV/2/6-VLP) induced the highest numbers of intestinal IgA ASCs and serum and intestinal IgA antibody titers, and protection rates were similar to or higher than those induced by three oral doses of attenuated RV (Gonzalez et al., 2004, Gonzalez et al., 2008, Azevedo et al., 2010). Interestingly, priming with two doses of 2/6-VLP (IN or oral) followed by live attenuated RV was ineffective for inducing IgA antibodies or protection. Thus the use of a replicating vaccine to prime at one inductive site (GALT) followed by boosting with a nonreplicating vaccine at a second mucosal inductive site (nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, NALT) is an effective strategy for stimulating protective mucosal immune responses, which can be applied to other enteric viral vaccines. Furthermore, efficacy of the prime/boost strategy (replicating/nonreplicating vaccine, AttRV/2/6-VLP) was examined in the presence of high and low titers of passive antibodies to mimic neonatal pigs receiving maternal antibodies (Nguyen et al., 2006a, Nguyen et al., 2006b). Similar to AttRV/2/6-VLP prime/boost vaccine studies, plasmid DNA containing VP6 was used as a booster subsequent to oral attenuated RV vaccine priming. This regimen showed high protection against shedding, but poor efficacy against RV diarrhea (Yuan et al., 2005). Collectively these findings suggest that mucosal boosters are effective in enhancing IgA antibody titers to RVs in orally primed animals (Gonzalez et al., 2008).",

These findings suggest that probiotics are an alternative, cheap, and safe adjuvant for enhancing efficacy of oral attenuated RV vaccines in animals and potentially in humans. Colonization of pigs by two different strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri) and subsequent virulent RV infection resulted in higher and balanced Th1/Th2/Treg cytokine responses (IL-12, IFN\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10, TGF\u03b2), higher total intestinal IgA-secreting cells, total serum IgM, and intestinal IgM and IgG titers, although the numbers of IgA RV ASCs and serum and intestinal RV antibody titers did not differ compared to virulent RV-only infected pigs. No overall difference in protection rates was noted when compared to virulent RV-only inoculated pigs, which was likely because of the short interval (only 3 days) between LAB colonization and virulent RV challenge (Zhang et al., 2008a, Azevedo et al., 2012). Dual colonization of the aforementioned LAB strains also modulated innate immune components in virulent RV inoculated pigs as follows: (1) enhanced frequency of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the intestine and their distribution; (2) enhanced TLR2- and TLR9-expressing CD14+APC, and TLR2-expressing CD14\u2212 APCs in the blood, but reduced TLR3- and TLR9-expressing CD14\u2212 APCs in the spleen, and (3) reduced frequency of M\u03a6 and cDCs in the spleen. Collectively, these findings suggest that probiotics may reduce systemic inflammatory responses induced by virulent RV. Effects on TLR expression on APCs in the ileum were not determined (Zhang et al., 2008c, Wen et al., 2009, Wen et al., 2011). Probiotics may not only modulate immune responses to RVs or other enteric vaccines, but may also directly ameliorate diarrhea/infection by enhancing gut barrier integrity and maintaining intestinal permeability, by stimulating nonspecific immune responses, by changing gut microbial populations, and by aiding in the regulation and prevention of apoptosis (Madsen et al., 2001, Yan and Polk, 2002, Preidis et al., 2012).",

The natural occurrence of a deletion mutant of TGEV with exclusive respiratory tropism, referred to as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), provided a unique opportunity to study ASC responses and protective immunity to two antigenically related porcine coronaviruses with enteric (TGEV) versus respiratory (PRCV) tropism. Oral immunization of pigs with TGEV induced high numbers of IgA ASC in the intestine and provided complete protection against TGEV challenge, whereas IN immunization of pigs with PRCV induced mainly systemic responses (IgG ASC) and provided only partial protection against TGEV challenge. Thus, the IN PRCV alone failed to elicit sufficient intestinal IgA ASC to provide full protection against the enteric pathogen, TGEV. Findings from this study and RV vaccine studies suggest that the use of multiple mucosal inductive sites in a prime/boost vaccination regimen may be an effective approach for overcoming compartmentalization in the common mucosal immune system.",

            "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) infects crypt enterocytes causing hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in pups (Saif and Jackwood, 1990). Because CPV is likely disseminated to the basolateral surface of crypts by the hematogenous route, serum NA (derived maternally or actively produced) is protective against the disease. Pollock and Carmichael (1982) demonstrated that pups with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) serum antibody titers of >1:80 were immune to oronasal CPV type 2 challenge. CPV is highly stable in the environment and pups were susceptible to infection as soon as maternal antibodies declined to HI titers of 1:64\u20131:80. A maternal HI antibody titer as low as 1:20 severely affected the efficacy of a live low titer CPV vaccine (100\u2013115th passage in culture) in generating active immune responses (Carmichael et al., 1983), which resulted in a window of susceptibility for pups. Others have shown that an HI titer of less than 1:20 in CPV-2 (low passage, high titer) vaccinated pups did not severely affect active antibody responses (Burtonboy et al., 1991, Hoare et al., 1997), suggesting that increasing the dose or reducing the attenuation of the virus may help to overcome inhibitory effects of maternal antibodies. Studies with modified live variant CPV-2b strain (low titer) have shown that these vaccines, when given either parenterally (40th passage) or IN (68th tissue culture passage), elicited almost 100% protection in pups with maternal antibody titers of 1:10 to 1:80 and even 60% protection in pups with antibody titers of 1:160. Higher efficacy of these vaccines can be attributed to either strong inherent immunogenicity of these new vaccines or antigenic differences among CPV-2 and CPV-2a and CPV-2b (Pratelli et al., 2000). Overall, during the past four decades of CPV vaccine development, modified live viruses have proven superior to inactivated intramuscular (IM) vaccines (Appel, 1999). In brief, various strategies such as the use of less attenuated virus (low serial passage), high titer vaccines, multiple doses, or the use of the IN route of immunization have been attempted to overcome inhibitory influences of maternal antibodies and to reduce the window of susceptibility in pups.",

Antigenic differences between original CPV-2 and its variants may reduce the efficacy of current CPV vaccines, which is supported by in vitro virus-neutralization tests conducted on vaccinated animals that showed low cross-reactivity between heterologous CPV variants (Cavalli et al., 2008).

            "text": "Oral vaccines for the induction of active immunity against bacterial diarrhea are not commonly used in livestock, although E. coli diarrhea is an important problem in neonatal and postweaning calves and pigs. F4 (K88) and F18 are the major fimbrial adhesins present on swine enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and are major targets for E. coli vaccines (Fairbrother et al., 2005). Whole bacteria vaccines are routinely administered parenterally to pregnant cattle, sheep, and swine to protect their suckling neonates against ETEC infections (Moon and Bunn, 1993). Such vaccines are practical and effective because: (1) fimbriae are required for the adhesion-colonization of bacteria early in the pathogenesis of the disease; (2) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the neonatal period; (3) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types, (4) and mothers are seropositive to ETEC so booster responses are elicited. Recent vaccine studies have focused on administration of purified bacterial subunits (transgenically expressed adhesin of F4 fimbriae in plants) and mucosal adjuvants (Verdonck et al., 2005, Joensuu et al., 2006) and have shown promising results. Overall, the vaccine strategy used, parenteral vaccination of field-exposed seropositive mothers, to induce lactogenic immunity is the same as that shown to be effective for parenteral application of RV vaccines in RV seropositive mothers (Bohl et al., 1984, Saif and Jackwood, 1990, Saif and Fernandez, 1996).",

Studies conducted in immunodeficient or specific gene knockout adult mice have shown that neither CD4+ or CD8+ T cells nor antibodies were essential for induction of protective immunity to RV infection, but usually one of these effectors (T or B cells) was necessary for elimination of primary RV infection (McNeal et al., 1995, McNeal et al., 2002). In pigs, recent studies have shown that CD4+ and CD8+ IFN\u03b3 producing T cells play a role in protection against RV diarrhea and infection (Yuan et al., 2008), but it is difficult to create genetically modified pigs similar to knockout mice, to assess the contribution of B cells and T cells. The redundant nature of immune responses to RV in mice, the multiple immunologic and possibly nonimmunologic pathways to resolve RV infections (Franco and Greenberg, 2000, Ward, 2003), the age factor and host differences in RV pathogenesis in mice and pigs (Saif et al., 1996, Saif et al., 1997, Ward, 2008), and the use of inbred mouse strains contribute to the discrepancies seen between the adult mouse and the neonatal pig models.",

To develop effective mucosal vaccines, it is important to determine correlates of protection against enteric pathogens. Generally for localized gut infections, S-IgA antibodies and intestinal T cells play an important role. Improved vaccines that induce high levels of intestinal IgA antibodies against the appropriate microbial antigens can be achieved by choosing the proper vaccine formulation and delivery method. Vaccines should also induce: (1) heterotypic protection; (2) active immunity in the presence of maternal antibodies; and, (3) long-lasting immunological memory. Novel vaccines (e.g., VLPs, transgenic plants), adjuvants (e.g., mLT, ISCOMs, TLR ligands (e.g., CpG), mycobacterial extracts, 1\u03b1 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, retinoic acid, probiotics, and cytokines), and vaccine delivery systems (e.g., recombinant plant or animal viruses or bacterial vectors, genetically engineered probiotics, ISCOMs, liposomes, and nanoparticles) should be explored and evaluated in relevant animal models to further enhance the efficacy of current or new vaccines. Recent studies have shown that the targeting of antigens directly to APCs (via surface receptors) is an effective way to tailor immune responses to optimize protection and should be explored further in large animals (Trumpfheller et al., 2012).",

Vaccinated mothers develop higher levels of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk and increased levels of immunity in their offspring (Glezen, 2001, Saif and Fernandez, 1996). Passive immunity can also be enhanced by oral administration of immune milk or heterologous antibody preparations (e.g., chicken egg yolk IgY (Ikemori et al., 1992; Kuroki et al., 1994) or monoclonal antibodies) or by parenteral administration of hyperimmune plasma (Becu et al., 1997). Recent studies using monoclonal, single-chain antibodies (variable heavy domain (VHH) nanoantibodies) of llama origin open new possibilities for providing passive immunity to humans and animals (Garaicoechea et al., 2008). Immunoglobulins of the IgG2 and IgG3 isotypes of camelids consist of heavy chains without associated light chains (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993). The distinctive biochemical characteristics and binding qualities of VHH antibodies overcome some key limitations of conventional antibodies (see below).",

In avian species IgY, the functional equivalent of mammalian IgG, is transferred to the yolk to passively protect the developing chick (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012). In primates and rabbits, maternal IgG is transferred across the placenta to the fetus. In rodents, transplacental transfer occurs in combination with prolonged (16\u201321 days) postnatal transfer by means of colostrum and milk (Husband, 1998). In dogs and cats transfer of IgG occurs by a combination of prenatal and postnatal mechanisms, with 5% to 10% of total transfer occurring before birth (Tizard, 2013). In ruminants, horses, and pigs, offspring are born virtually agammaglobulinemic and transmission of Ig occurs only via colostrum for a limited time after birth (Tizard, 2013). After the transition from production of colostrum to milk, Ig are no longer absorbed from the intestines and only act locally in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Failure of passive transfer (FPT) is a common problem, however, in newborn calves and foals (Besser and Gay, 1994, Tyler-McGowan et al., 1997). FPT may occur because of the production of low quantities of colostrum, because of production of colostrum with low concentrations of maternal antibodies, because of ingestion of low quantities of colostrum, or because of inefficient absorption (Quigley and Drewry, 1998). Colostrum supplements, colostrum replacers, and plasma products have been developed commercially to address this problem, with variable success. Vaccination of the dam in late pregnancy can enhance antibody titers in colostrum and after suckling in the serum of the offspring (Saif and Fernandez, 1996). The benefits of vaccination of the dam for enhancing passive immunity can be lost if colostrum is of low quality or if absorption of colostral Ig is inefficient.",

Earlier weaning practices reduce intake of milk antibodies. Maternal enteric vaccines are commonly used in two populations of pregnant animals. To control epidemic infections, they are used in na\u00efve, seronegative animals to induce primary immune responses.

Unfortunately, it is well documented that maternal antibodies can suppress active immune responses following vaccination. This effect has been observed with both live and nonreplicating vaccines, and for both systemic and mucosal responses (Siegrist et al., 1998, Hodgins et al., 1999, Parre\u00f1o et al., 1999, Nguyen et al., 2006a, Nguyen et al., 2006b). Antibody responses especially are affected; T-lymphocyte responses may not be suppressed (Siegrist et al., 1998). Titers of maternal antibodies are maximal for most species of interest in the first week of life and then decline gradually over the next few months, but variability of titers among individuals is high. With many vaccines, a \u201cwindow of disease susceptibility\u201d of variable duration occurs when titers of maternal antibodies are too low to mediate protection, but are too high to permit effective vaccination. A number of strategies are used to cope with this problem.",

A common strategy for vaccines of dogs and cats is to administer a series of doses of vaccine from an early age (at which time only a few individuals will be responsive) and to continue vaccinating until an age at which virtually all can respond to vaccination. This strategy has economic disadvantages for the pet owner. Some manufacturers produce low passage, high virus titer vaccines especially for use in situations where high titers of maternal antibodies and high pathogen exposure are anticipated. This is similar to a strategy once (but no longer) approved by the World Health Organization for vaccination of children in developing countries against measles (Gellin and Katz, 1994). Preliminary evidence suggests that incorporation of vaccine antigens in highly structured ISCOMs or IN application of vaccines can enhance immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies (Van Binnendijk et al., 1997, Brockmeier et al., 1997).",

In contrast camelid species produce \u201cheavy chain immunoglobulins\u201d that lack light chains and the first constant heavy domain (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993). The antigen-binding site of these unusual heavy chain antibodies is formed by a single domain, designated VHH in camelids. VHH are easily produced as recombinant proteins, designated single domain nanoantibodies or nanobodies\u00ae and represent the smallest molecule in nature capable of binding a specific antigen. The CDR3 region of these nanobodies has the capacity to form long loops that can extend into cavities on antigens, e.g., the active site crevice of enzymes. Other advantageous features of nanobodies include their high solubility, thermal stability (resist pasteurization), refolding capacity, and optimal tissue penetration in vivo (reviewed by Vanlandschoot et al. (2011)). Nanobodies have demonstrated efficacy as agents of passive immunity for infectious diseases. VHH specific for rotavirus inner capsid protein VP6 are able to broadly neutralize rotaviruses independently of serotype, and in mouse experiments provide passive protection against challenge with human rotavirus (Pant et al., 2006, Garaicoechea et al., 2008). Nanobodies against other viral diseases with veterinary impact have been developed (foot-and-mouth disease, influenza, rabies (Vanlandschoot et al., 2011)) and represent a promising next-generation biologic platform for passive immunity.",

Some commercial vaccines for fish are administered by intraperitoneal or IM injection, but mucosal vaccines are also widely used (reviewed by Brudeseth et al. (2013)). Fish are routinely vaccinated by immersion in tanks of diluted bacterin, modified live bacteria or viruses, with exposure times ranging from 30 s up to 60 min, depending on the vaccine and age of the fish. It is unclear whether the main route of antigen uptake is oral or via the mucosal surface of the gills. Several commercial vaccines are now available that consist of recombinant viral proteins for mixing into the feed (Evensen and Leong, 2013); 10 days of feeding is recommended by the manufacturer.",

Investigations of pathogen\u2013host interactions in outbred animals have illustrated the complexity of these interactions. Early studies of an enteric coronavirus infection of swine (TGEV) led to the concept of the gut\u2013mammary gland S\u2013IgA immunologic axis and provided part of the basic tenet for a common mucosal immune system. Later studies of TGEV and a deletion mutant of TGEV with respiratory tropism (PRCV) revealed functional compartmentalization within the common mucosal immune system whereby IN inoculation of pigs with PRCV failed to elicit sufficient intestinal IgA antibody to fully protect against the enteric pathogen TGEV (VanCott et al., 1993, VanCott et al., 1994). Subsequent studies have explored new prime/boost mucosal immunization strategies to elicit intestinal immunity to rotavirus in na\u00efve pigs (Saif, 1999b, Yuan and Saif, 2002, Gonzalez et al., 2008). In these studies only oral priming with attenuated virus led to successful IN booster responses using nonreplicating (VLP) vaccines combined with mucosal adjuvants such as ISCOM or mLT. Thus use of a replicating vaccine to prime lymphocytes at a major mucosal inductive site (GALT) followed by boosting with a nonreplicating vaccine at a second inductive site (NALT) effectively stimulated intestinal IgA antibodies and induced active protection against rotavirus diarrhea. Although there is progress in developing safe and effective nonreplicating vaccines to boost mucosal immune responses (Saif and Fernandez, 1996), the dilemma remains to develop effective vaccines to prime for mucosal immunity. Mucosal adjuvants (mLT, ISCOM, CpG, cytokines) and new delivery systems (replicating vectors, microparticles) have shown promise in animal studies reviewed in this chapter. However, their economical production and final evaluation under field conditions, including in the presence of maternal antibodies as relevant, are needed.",

For example, the primary Ig in mammary secretions of ruminants is IgG1 which is actively transported to the mammary gland from serum and provides effective passive immunity to the nursing offspring against enteric pathogens. Thus parenteral immunization of the dam stimulates passive immunity in ruminants against enteric pathogens. In contrast, in monogastrics, IgA predominates in milk and IgA lymphoblasts that traffic to the mammary gland originate in the intestine. Therefore oral vaccines in monogastrics may provide a more effective vaccine strategy to induce IgA antibodies in milk (Saif and Fernandez, 1996). By applying the aforementioned vaccine concepts with new and effective mucosal adjuvants, delivery systems, and bioengineered vectors expressing appropriate microbial antigens, it is likely that a new generation of veterinary vaccines will emerge to better cope with existing and emerging mucosal pathogens.",
