Schools and workplaces are closed, and people are isolated. The older population is threatened, and although younger people are possibly physically less threatened, their behaviors could be riskier. The Commonwealth of Kentucky has closed down, and yet a young person who had attended a \u201ccoronavirus party\u201d has been reported sick. Social distancing was not followed. The press has a variety of things to say. The President is on television in the evening with his team. The news cycle is disrupted, and some are not happy with that.

The patients must not only consider the usual benefits and risks of the surgical procedure according to their own personal values, they must also consider the unique risks of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically with regard to the risks of personal and clinician exposure. The COVID-19 pandemic has progressed especially rapidly in part because asymptomatic hosts can transmit the virus3. Although the true prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is not known, in a limited population, 51% (318 of 619) of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 were entirely asymptomatic4. Clinicians are at especially high risk for COVID-19, and as long as the testing capacity in the U.S. lags so substantially behind what is needed, any clinical encounter will place patients and health-care personnel at risk for infection5,6. Given the risks and benefits of each surgical procedure, each patient can theoretically make an informed decision, although a decision about the risks of COVID-19 transmission cannot be fully informed because of a lack of information. For the sake of the argument, let us assume that (1) neither patient will become ill with COVID-19, (2) both patients will derive more benefit than harm from their respective procedures, and (3) both would like to proceed with the procedure. A number of professional athletes have been exposed due to the nature of their work with team meetings, practices, etc. The professional athlete puts the entire medical team at risk, possibly taking many health-care providers out of the available work pool as a result of being exposed to or acquiring COVID-19. The patient with the ankle injury has not yet returned to work, has been staying at home, and has not had any family exposure, which would lessen or minimize the risks of exposure from the patient to the surgical team.",

The Red Cross has an extreme shortage presently, with over 2,700 blood drives being cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic9. The Red Cross supplies about 40% of the U.S. blood supply, and about 80% of the blood acquired by the Red Cross typically comes from areas where drives have been cancelled, which represents a possible 32% reduction in available supply if the Red Cross is the only affected organization. Because the duration of the pandemic is difficult to project and because blood products are perishable (blood lasts for 42 days, platelets for 5 days, and plasma for up to 1 year), the severity of this shortage will likely become more profound as time progresses10, and blood may be rationed11.

Each surgeon has to make their own decision and analyze whether they consider performing an elective or possibly semi-urgent procedure is safe for themselves and their team members. That decision-making process is evolving, and some facilities may take the decision out of the hands of individual surgeons. If there is a complication related to anesthesia or the surgical procedure itself, further health-care resources may be necessary and utilized. Because physicians have an inherent drive to strongly advocate for patients at bedside, hospitals are utilizing committees to help reduce bias in determining what elective procedures are acceptable going forward.",

In the case of the ankle reconstruction, it may be correct to proceed given the potential limb compromise and the possibility of even greater resource utilization if the patient were to become septic from the open wound. In the case of the professional athlete, more serious questions arise. During a pandemic, when social justice takes on increased relevance, how can one argue for the performance of elective elbow procedures? The money that the team and player stand to make (as well as the money the physician will earn) is morally irrelevant amidst a pandemic. Triage of ill patients to match available resources may become an issue moving forward. There may be instances in which resources are not available and a battlefield-style triage of each patient is required as a result of the pandemic. Because resources are limited, equal-access distribution of these resources should be considered.

The resources, patient, surgical staff, and hospital-related services should not be threatened for the care of 1 person unless treatment is essential. It is imperative that orthopaedic surgeons carefully weigh these factors and demonstrate responsibility and leadership when balancing the desire to advocate for patients at bedside and the need to exemplify good management of limited resources.
