            "text": "In \"Combatting Professional Burnout Through Creative Writing,\" Cronin et al. point out that while burnout may be a problem, creative writing could even become a sort of medication. Such an activity may help in solving, or at least keeping at bay, the conflict between the calling and reality. (4) There are other tactics to be employed such as taking early retirement, seeing fewer patients, attending meetings, even leaving medicine; yet, creative writing complements other measures or, in itself, becomes a sovereign remedy for burnout. The authors point out some beginning techniques, such as writing for journals and then developing the ability to write fiction. Persistence is the key. Sometimes, as we know, ability to write is such that \"the writer\" overshadows the \"physician.\" Such is the case with Michael Crichton (1942-2008) (The Andromeda Strain), (5) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) (Sherlock Holmes), (6) or Archibald J Cronin (1896-1981) (The Citadel). (7) In other instances, the ability to write and the scientific capacities go hand in hand, as it happened with Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal (1852-1934). (8) Three Venezuelan dermatologists in independent contributions shed light on challenges and opportunities provided by migration. Paola Pasquali in \"A dermatologist\u00b4s peek on emigration and professionalism\" writes from her experience in moving from Venezuela to Spain, where she currently practices as a dermatologist. (9) She emphasizes the Venezuelan diaspora, underlining the fact that training physicians is an expensive endeavor. When doctors leave their country, an investment is \"lost,\" and the general population is left with less access to medical care. The receiving country or society does gain the proceedings of an investment it did NOT make. Still, Venezuela received a torrent of immigrants during the XXth Century, particularly after World War II.",

Their main point is that physicians, apart from their specific skills, are both problem solvers and communicators, who are capable of integrating their experiences with society. They may be incorporated by following the usual time -consuming and rather irrelevant formalities to revalidate their licenses to practice medicine. A wise community would employ them by channeling this gift from other countries with reciprocal benefits, just as rain water should not be left to run unused into the sea. Elston\u00b4s paper, \"Maintaining our Edge and Training the Next Generation of Dermatologists,\" poignantly and concisely, describes the salient features associated with the practice of dermatology. (14) It underlines what distinguishes dermatology from other specialties: namely, the visual nature of diagnoses and follow ups plus the correlation of clinical and pathologic features of the skin and its diseases. He also points out the traits in training and practice that differ in the United States and other, mainly European, countries. Elston reminds us of the fields that American dermatology has abandoned, such as venereology, but points out that this is not the case in other countries.",
