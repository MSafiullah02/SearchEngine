In relation to human populations, we focus primarily on human health as an index of well-being. We also introduce concepts of climate justice. Many of our examples are taken from the United States, although we also include other regions of the world in our analysis as appropriate. We discuss various ways in which mitigation and adaptation strategies can help reduce the magnitude and the impacts of the changes we are likely to experience, as well as improve human health and directly or indirectly affect ecosystem functions and services. Finally, although our analysis sets priorities and orders of importance for an ideal world unimpeded by political considerations, cultural differences, or economic limitations, we include a discussion of the social considerations that we believe must be incorporated into the development and application of mitigation or adaptation strategies.",

For example, increasing the efficiency of light-duty vehicles (cars and small trucks) has the potential to reduce their carbon emissions by up to 50% by 2030 (IPCC 2007b). Such efficiencies can be attained by a combination of reducing vehicle weights, increasing aerodynamics, increasing engine efficiency (particularly diesel engine efficiency), and increasing the use of biofuels and electric and hybrid vehicles. In 2006, the International Energy Association projected that the proportion of transportation energy supplied by biofuels could be increased to 10% (IEA 2006a). Although there is good evidence of successful biofuel markets and programs (e.g., ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil, Goldemberg 2007), there are also negative consequences of increased biofuel production for biodiversity and carbon storage (Fargione et al. 2008; Fletcher et al. 2010). One opportunity for transportation mitigation strategy is the promotion of behavioral changes of drivers. Efficiency of road vehicles could be improved by 5\u201320% by changes in driving styles, improved maintenance, more efficient tires, reduced idling, and traffic design and maintenance (IPCC 2007b).",

Decreasing the demand for transportation largely involves changes in human behavior, urban and landscape planning, and changes in technology. Sprawling, low-density urban neighborhoods, such as those found in the United States, perpetuate automobile dependency and transform ecologically functional landscapes into subdivisions. Compact, high-density communities with local urban centers allow residents to work and live in close proximity, and help build social capital among residents and protect natural areas. In conjunction with human-centered transportation infrastructure such as sidewalks, bike lanes, and public transportation, compact neighborhoods reduce car dependency while simultaneously improving the physical fitness of residents.

In the United States and elsewhere, people s relationships with the automobile involve issues of convenience, independence, safety, and social status. Changing these relationships will involve making forms of public transportation more convenient, more effective, and more appealing. Rising fuel costs and commute times may provide some opportunity for implementing transportation-based mitigation strategies. Failing automobile industries and economic crises may provide another. Similar to the projects undertaken by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the United States in the depression of the 1930s, modern-day work relief programs could be used to transform transportation systems. Short of such crises, major changes in transportation will take a combination of regulatory action, education, and incentive programs.",

Mines that observe best management practices such as land reclamation have fewer negative impacts on climate, local ecosystems, and human health. Sustainably harvested lumber can act as a long-term carbon sink and contribute to the productive and ecological resilience of forests. Rapidly renewable lumber alternatives such as bamboo can offset the demand for slow-growing trees species, rebuild soils, and set the stage for reforestation.

Recent climate modeling has demonstrated a positive feedback in the \u2018dust bowl\u2019 drought of the 1930s in the United States (Schubert et al. 2004; Cook et al. 2009). Cook et al.

As a result of the dust bowl, more than 50% of the surveyed farms comprising 8.7 million acres were seriously eroded, and the economic loss was valued close to US$200 million (AAAS 1936). A combination of warming, drought, and conventional agricultural practices together have the potential to re-create the dust bowl of the 1930s in the Great Plains of the United States (Rosenzweig and Hillel 1993).",

Another mitigation strategy to reduce emissions involves shifting livestock production regimes from ruminants to more efficient and lower impact monogastric species (e.g., poultry), well-managed fisheries and aquaculture, and promoting plant-based protein sources (Pelletier and Tyedmers 2010; Steinfeld and Gerber 2010).",

Several mitigation strategies for addressing energy consumption have been provided in the previous sections on transportation and shelter. In addition to those strategies, increasing the efficiency of appliances and lighting is likely to provide significant reductions in GHG emissions. The most efficient appliances in use today use half to one-fifth of their most inefficient counterparts currently in use (IPCC 2007b). In developed countries, substituting smaller and more efficient refrigerators, washing machines, and other appliances for less efficient ones can substantially reduce energy use. In addition, in developed countries, improvements in the efficiency of electronic devices with inefficient standby modes and power supplies (or more simply unplugging these devices when not in use) can significantly reduce energy consumption. In developing countries where biomass (e.g., wood, dung, and charcoal) is used for cooking fuel, substantial reductions in GHG emissions and improvements in human health may be attained by increasing the efficiency of biomass stoves, fostering a shift to cleaner burning liquid and gaseous fuels, and improving access to electricity (IPCC 2007b).",

Tidal barrages allow water to flow into a bay or estuary during flood tide, then they release the water back during ebb tide. As water is released it flows through turbines generating energy. The impact of barrages on fish may be substantial (Aprahamian et al. 2010). Power can also be extracted in the marine environment by turbines in regions of high wave and current energy. However, the ecological impact of the extraction of energy in highly energetic environments is not clear (Shields et al. 2011).

Nonetheless, many biofuels require significant amounts of land and water to grow them, which brings fuel production into conflict with food production as well as potentially result in a climate effect from the alteration in the surface fluxes of heat and moisture into the atmosphere. In addition, fuel plants may not be as effective as others at absorbing GHGs, and more natural lands converted to agriculture for biofuels will result in increased erosion, decreased water quality, and a loss of wildlife habitat and biodiversity.",

Solar water heating is a cost-effective alternative to other fuel sources in many locations. Similarly, passive solar heating of buildings (mentioned in the Section 4.25.2.2 Shelter) is an effective heating measure in many regions. Finally, solar energy can be used to generate power with solar thermal electric plants that focus solar rays to heat a liquid, which is then used to generate electricity. Passive solar space heating and hot water production likely have the lowest environmental costs. Decentralized photovoltaic use on residences and buildings incurs environmental costs in terms of the production process, but likely have few other negative effects.

These proposed approaches are still on the scientific fringe and considered to be highly unproven and/or potentially quite risky. One such approach is to capture carbon in the oceans through iron fertilization. In regions of the ocean where there are ample nutrients to drive primary production (photosynthesis) but observations show that chlorophyll is relatively low, the lack of iron is thought to limit the productivity. Over the last two decades, several experiments have attempted to determine whether the addition of elemental iron into the water could cause an increase in algal production and ultimately, as photosynthesis fixes carbon into organic molecules that then sink, the sequestration of carbon in deep ocean sediments. However, the results of these experiments are mixed (de Baar et al. 2005), with the export of carbon being difficult to assess and likely quite modest. At the same time, the impacts on local ecosystems and thus ultimately fisheries in potentially highly productive regions of the subpolar oceans are not yet known. Other carbon sequestration approaches have also been proposed including pumping air down into the oceans, injecting carbon into the ground, and incorporating biochar into soils.",

These approaches are collectively referred to as geoengineering. At present, these approaches are unproven, risky, and, at best, will only address some of the impacts of the human influence on climate. One such geoengineering approach would inject sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere. These aerosols would reflect incoming solar rays and reduce warming. Although such an approach might reduce average global temperatures, it would also likely decrease average global precipitation (Bala et al. 2008) as well as alter atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns. For a given change in radiative forcing, solar forcing is more effective at changing the hydrological cycle than forcing from carbon dioxide owing to differences in the surface latent heat (and thus evaporation) response. While the impact of carbon dioxide fertilization could increase net primary production in terrestrial ecosystems (Govindasamy et al. 2002), ecosystems could continue to be vulnerable due to changes in water resources. In addition, solar radiation management would not address the potentially significant problem of ocean acidification to marine ecosystems.",

Poor communities tend to bear not only the unequal burden of polluting, destructive, and destabilizing industries but also a disproportionate share of the blame for environmental destruction and responsibility for ameliorating environmental change. For example, polluting industries are often located in poor communities due to cheap land values and the inability of poor communities to politically resist their presence, or a desire to develop jobs at any cost. For instance, swidden agriculturalists in Southeast Asia have been blamed for forest fires despite satellite data pinning large fires to government-sponsored oil palm plantations (Harwell 2000) and Southeast Asian fishers living near toxic riparian runoff from mining have been blamed for polluting local waters by cyanide fishing (Lowe 2006).",

Resilient systems will be able to maintain ecosystem functions and processes and avoid a transition to a new state as climates change.

The outcomes of these more aggressive and forward-looking strategies will be more uncertain, and their implementation will be more controversial.

However, many species with limited dispersal abilities or that face significant barriers to dispersal will be unable to respond to changing climates. Assisted colonization is one strategy that has been proposed for facilitating climate-driven range shifts (Hunter 2007; McLachlan et al. 2007); also referred to as managed relocation and assisted migration \u2013 assisted colonization is the translocation of species outside their native range to facilitate movement in response to climate change. The concept is controversial for both ethical and ecological reasons. Some researchers have highlighted the potential for negative, ecological, evolutionary, and economic impacts, as well as ethical concerns (Ricciardi and Simberloff 2009; Sax et al. 2009). Advocates argue that assisted colonization will be essential for cases in which species will have to move to find suitable environments but will be unable to do so, that many of the potential risks are overblown, and that guidance can be developed for the strategic and informed use of assisted colonization. Several decision-making frameworks and prioritization strategies for applying assisted colonization have been proposed (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2008; Richardson et al. 2009). Although assisted colonization will likely be a useful strategy in many systems, there will be specific factors and risks that will need to be considered for particular systems (e.g., in freshwater systems, Olden et al. 2011).",

This has led to a growing realization that society derives substantial benefits both from out-of-stream extractions of water as well as by maintaining adequate flows of water within freshwater ecosystems.

Consequently, the linear nature of river systems makes them highly prone to fragmentation from waterfalls, dams, and water withdrawals. Such fragmentation can not only limit dispersal and the ability of species to track climate change but also disrupt the completion of life cycles for many freshwater organisms. For many streams, especially in arid and semiarid ecosystems, there is concern that more frequent and severe droughts will lead to the building of more dams and water diversions, further fragmenting stream networks (Seager et al. 2007).",

Species responses to climate change will be limited by human-engineered structures, including hundreds of thousands of dams, diversions, and impassable road culverts that exist globally (Nilsson and Schopfhauser 1995). In the United States alone, there are over 80 000 large dams and an estimated 2.5 million or more small impoundments that disrupt the dispersal of aquatic organisms. In recent decades, however, new water laws and programs have helped to increase habitat connectivity by removing or modifying human barriers to movement in river systems. Increasingly, small dams and diversions are being removed for a number of ecological, social, and economic reasons, including the enhancement of longitudinal connectivity for fish migration (Stanley and Doyle 2003). Similarly, temporary barriers such as impassable culverts under roadways are being modified to allow for easier recolonization and movement of fishes (Roni et al. 2008). Although this management strategy may promote the adaptive capacity of species to respond to climate change, the removal of such obstructions can simultaneously increase the risk of invasion by nonnative species and associated diseases, which are major threats to ecosystem structure and function. In fact, the conversion of culverts into permanent barriers has been a common management approach to protect isolated native populations from invasive species spreading upstream (Fausch et al. 2009). Given the complexities of promoting the movement of native species while concurrently limiting the spread of invasive species, it is unlikely that the removal of barriers to enhance habitat connectivity will be a successful adaptation strategy in all areas for reducing the impacts of climate change on ecosystem function.",

Recent modeling suggests that riparian habitat restoration can play an important role in offsetting the effects of climate change. Battin et al. (2007) used a series of linked models of climate, land cover, hydrology, and salmon population dynamics to investigate the impacts of altered stream flow and temperature on the effectiveness of proposed habitat restoration efforts designed to recover Chinook salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This study showed that in the absence of habitat restoration, basin-wide spawning populations would decline by an average of 20\u201340% by 2050. By contrast, they found large increases in juvenile rearing capacity associated with proposed riparian habitat restoration, which limited climate-induced declines to 5% according to one climate model and increased salmon abundance by 19% according to another model. However, the model results showed that not all expected climate impacts could be mitigated entirely. In relatively narrow streams, reforestation was predicted to decrease water temperatures by increasing shading, but in wide, main-stem reaches where most Chinook salmon spawn, riparian vegetation had a minor effect on water temperature. In addition to restoring riparian areas, targeted protection of forested riparian buffers using fencing to stop livestock from entering the stream and trampling/grazing vegetation or conservation easements to eliminate farming activities may also help to reduce stream temperatures.",

Changes in species composition, the timing of ecological events, and the rates of ecosystem processes will result in changes in the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide.

            "text": "In addition to these simple rules of thumb for placing reserves to address climate change, many more sophisticated approaches to selecting areas for new reserves have been proposed. For example, modeled climate-driven shifts in species distributions can be used to select new reserves that will protect biodiversity today and into the future (Hannah et al. 2007; Vos et al. 2008; Hole et al. 2009). Although this approach may prove useful for some species and systems, care must be taken in the use of the models developed to project species range shifts. There are many uncertainties associated with the models themselves and the climate projections on which they rely. Another proposed approach to building a reserve network that will be resilient to climate change involves protecting environments in lieu of protecting species and systems. This approach has been referred to as \u2018protecting the ecological stage.\u2019 This analogy implies that the species and the ecological systems are players and that the soils and topography of a region form the stage on which they interact and evolve. By protecting a suite of diverse environments, it is assumed that one will protect the areas where new ecological systems can develop as climates change (Anderson and Ferree 2010; Beier and Brost 2010). Similarly, others have suggested that more resilient reserve networks will be those that include a diversity of current climates (Pyke and Fischer 2005). Although climates will change, many of the climate gradients generated by latitudinal and topographic patterns will remain. Thus, a set of reserves that protects a diversity of climates today will likely protect a diversity of climates in the future. At least one recent study has applied the concept of protecting environments (topographies, soils, and climate gradients) to a reserve-selection problem (Schloss et al. 2011). One last approach to building a resilient reserve network in a changing climate involves placing reserves in areas that are likely to serve as climate refugia. Refugia are areas that are projected to experience minimal climatic changes and/or have cooler microclimates (Saxon et al. 2005; Hansen et al. 2010; Shoo et al. 2011).",

Traditionally, such corridors have been designed for particular focal species, and they have connected reserves or remaining fragments of habitat. However, corridors that facilitate species ranges shifts and the reshuffling of ecosystems will need to connect what is habitat for a species today with an area that may become habitat in the future. In this way, corridor design will need to evolve to address climate change. One such approach to developing corridors for addressing climate change involves basing the corridors on environmental gradients instead of on the current vegetation (which is often used as a measure of habitat) (Beier and Brost 2010). Another approach uses projected changes in climate to orient corridors (Ackerly et al. 2010). A third method involves using modeled shifts in species distributions to identify potential routes that species would need to take to move from currently suitable climates to places where climates will likely be suitable in the future (Williams et al. 2005; Rose and Burton 2009). These three approaches are based on different assumptions and have different levels of associated uncertainty. In general, the uncertainty increases with the intensity of modeling required to identify the corridor, and thus the first of the three approaches has the least inherent uncertainty and the last of the three has the most.",

Changes in forest harvest practices from clear-cuts to selective, retention harvests can increase the connectivity of forested landscapes.

Some natural protection features such as sea ice cannot be maintained in the face of increasing temperatures. In Alaska, the loss of sea ice and melting of permafrost due to warming ocean and air temperatures has exposed the shore to wave energy that used to be absorbed or damped by sea ice or frozen soils.

Corals are actually two creatures that live together in a symbiotic relationship. Zooxanthellae are the algal component of corals that provide nutrients generated from photosynthesis to the animal component. Different zooxanthellae species and different species of corals in general have differential environmental tolerances. For example, some corals near the Arabian Peninsula exist under conditions of salinity and temperature that are greater than near-term predicted future average salinities and temperatures resulting from climate change. These adaptive changes likely operate on a decadal time scale. Thus, in some cases, it may be possible to identify particular species or zooxanthellae and algal combinations that are more resilient to warming. Protecting coral reefs from other stressors such as excess sediment and/or nutrient and pollutant inputs from terrestrial sources and unregulated diving can increase the coral s ability to adapt to increased water temperatures.

Multiple adaptation options are available for improving crop performance in the face of such climate-driven stresses. First, in conjunction with conventional breeding, crop improvement through genetic engineering is seen as an effective adaptation tool in a changing climate \u2013 although public opinion is often divided on the use and consequences of genetically engineered crops (MacDiarmid 2007; Jones 2011). A second approach involves maintaining crop genetic diversity by, for example, collecting and storing the diversity of current cultivars or local landraces. A third adaptation strategy involves exploiting symbiotic relationships between crops and other organisms. For example, it has been shown that numerous fungal and bacterial endophytes confer stress tolerance to heat, drought, salinity, and pathogen attacks (Rodriguez et al. 2008; Rodriguez et al. 2009), and others promote growth and fix atmospheric nitrogen (Doty et al. 2009; Xin et al. 2009). Other strategies include the application of kaolin particle films to reduce heat stress and photoinhibition and to mitigate pest damage (Glenn et al. 1999; Glenn 2009) as well as the incorporation of biochar into soils to confer numerous agronomic benefits that enhance crop performance and stress tolerance (Marris 2006).",

By capturing high river flows and releasing the water in a carefully controlled manner, dam managers can deliver steady and dependable water supplies to downstream areas, protect settlements from floods, or generate power. Although human manipulation of the world s river flows has provided many societal benefits, it has also caused considerable ecological damage and the loss of important ecosystem services valued by society (Baron et al. 2002). Flow regulation for hydropower and storage, diversion for human use, and extraction of groundwater connected to stream systems often significantly affect the natural seasonal and interannual variation in river flow, commonly referred to as the natural flow regime (Poff et al. 1997). A natural flow regime is needed to sustain the complex riverine and riparian ecological functions and processes that support native biodiversity and provide myriad ecological services including maintaining water quality, recharging groundwater, and nutrient cycling (Naiman et al. 2002).",

Increasing demands for irrigation and industrial cooling water could conflict with the increasing demands for municipal water supplies resulting from urban growth. Climate-induced changes to water availability and increasing human demand for water are likely to prompt the construction or modification of dams and reservoirs to improve storage capacity and enhance water security (WCD 2000; Palmer 2008). For instance, by storing water in reservoirs, water managers capture high flows during wet years or seasons to supplement water supplies at drier times, thereby maximizing the reliability of water supplies and certain economic benefits each year.

Dams have also been implicated in the loss of commercial fisheries in many estuaries and coastal areas, and in the degradation of other natural ecosystem products and services worldwide (WCD 2000). In addition, reservoirs increase the loss of water due to evaporation. Finally, as mentioned above, reservoirs emit substantial quantities of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere (St. Louis et al. 2000), and therefore, the creation of additional reservoirs is likely to further promote climate change.",

Like most large-scale industrial processes, making water has a number of actual or potential impacts on aquatic goods and services (WWF 2007). Emerging issues include significant cost and pollution emitted by desalination plants and the mostly unknown, but potentially substantially, effects on freshwater and coastal ecosystems. Intake pipes can remove larvae and small marine organisms, and discharge from desalination plants can elevate levels of salt and other constituents of seawater such as boron; dead sea life, which consumes oxygen while decomposing; chemicals added to change the composition of the water for processing, as well as reducing contamination and clogging of filters and membranes; corrosion by-products; and the heat added for or during processing.

Although some adaptation strategies will be national and international in nature, much adaptation will take place at finer scales of communities and regions. A hallmark of climate change as a global phenomenon is that leadership and coordination across local, national, and international scales is important for ameliorating its effects. In turn, coordination across scales will entail understanding local climate risks and local and regional understandings of the causes of climate change and the costs and benefits of different mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

At the international level, efforts to shift blame from the activities of the rich to the actions of the poor have been used to shirk the responsibility to mitigate climate change and to impede the development of global mitigation strategies. The dispute between the Global North and South over who caused climate change and who must now take responsibility for mitigation is by now well known. Countries in the Global South argue that northern countries have already developed their economies relying on fossil fuel consumption and now, when it is their turn to develop, they are asked to put restrictions on their energy consumption and natural resource use. Meanwhile, the United States has used the reluctance of developing countries to cap emissions as an excuse for inaction on its part.

However, focusing on population size while ignoring global patterns in the consumption of resources and the distribution of wealth will result in failed policies and strategies. The world s human population is approaching 7 \u00d7 109, and a growing population inevitably means greater demand for the numerous goods and services supported by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. While the availability of resources has seemingly stretched beyond the direst predictions of several decades ago, the crisis of overconsumption \u2013 namely, of coal and other fossil fuels that produce GHGs and contribute to climate change \u2013 is simultaneously becoming clearer. While trends over the past several decades suggest that population growth is a significant driver of CO2 emissions (Bongaarts 1992; Dietz and Rosa 1997), it is also true that urbanization, aging, and changes in household size similarly affect energy use and emissions (MacKeller et al. 1995; Cole and Neumayer 2004). Particular point sources of GHG emissions from energy consumption in developed countries, like the internationally managed oil fields of Nigeria or emissions from the recent Iraq war, which since 2003 has released over 140 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of adding 25 million new cars to American roads (Reisch and Kretzmann 2008), should bear at least as much scrutiny as the desires of third world women and men to bear children. An overarching emphasis on population detracts from a nuanced understanding of the multiple drivers of GHG emissions.",

Disparities in climate change risk and human health often overlap, and human health and environmental health are intricately intertwined. Although diseases are often approached as singular phenomena, good models exist that demonstrate the interactive effects of multiple morbidity factors on health outcomes and disease trajectories. For example, interactions between acquired immune deficiency syndrome and tuberculosis, or diabetes and severe acute respiratory syndrome, have synergistic impacts on patients that must be understood together. Likewise, social attributes, like poverty or exposure to racism, interact with disease conditions to increase the damaging effects of disease. Such interactions have the potential to influence the effects of climate change on disease movement and clustering, disease interactions, and the impact of climate change on global health (Baer and Singer 2008). Human action and human vulnerability to such interactions between climate, disease, and the environment are structured by social and economic inequality, and thus mitigation and adaptation strategies will need to take these inequalities into account.",
