The positive rate was greatest in lower respiratory tract specimens, followed by nasopharyngeal aspirates, and faeces. Upper respiratory tract specimens, serum, and urine had the lowest positive rates. RT-PCR positive rate also varied with day after onset of disease when the specimen was taken. In nasopharyngeal aspirates, the positive rate in the first 2 days was only about a third, and rose to nearly 60% in 6\u201311 days, after which it declined. In faeces, the positive rate was fairly low in the first 5 days (up to 28%), but rose gradually to peak at around 70% at 9\u201314 days, with very high titres (table 2\n). Positive rates in faeces fell gradually, but remained high even after 23 days; one specimen was positive after 69 days. Results for other upper respiratory tract specimens, serum, and urine mirrored those of nasopharyngeal aspirates, although we received the bulk of specimens within 5 days of onset.",

This viral load profile had been reported previously.3, 5 Since patients are unlikely to be highly infectious in the first few days of illness, early isolation measures would probably be effective in prevention of transmission. Maximum viral shedding that was attained after 12\u201314 days of onset would explain why hospital workers were especially prone to infection, since most patients would be in hospital care at that time. This study also showed that specimens taken in the first few days of illness were less likely to have detectable SARS coronavirus RNA than were those taken at least 6 days after onset. Therefore, we recommend that repeat specimens be taken after 6 days, should the initial specimens on admission be negative.",

Although nasopharyngeal aspirates are much more sensitive to RT-PCR testing than are other upper respiratory tract specimens, they also carried a risk of aerosol generation. Faecal positive rates also proved sensitive; the low overall rate (28%) was distorted by collection of a large number of specimens after 23 days of illness, to assess whether recovered patients were still secreting virus. The presence of SARS coronavirus RNA in serum meant there was a possibility that the virus could be transmitted by the blood-borne route.",
