            "text": "Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is a member of the newly established genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. CCoV is strictly related to feline coronavirus type I (FCoV-I) and type II (FCoV-II), transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) and its respiratory variant porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV). Based on the similarities in their genomic organisation, all these viruses have been now included in a unique viral species Alphacoronavirus-1\n[1]. CCoV has a classical faecal\u2013oral route of transmission and colonises the top of the villi of the enteric tract, being responsible for mild, self-limiting enteritis. Infected pups usually recover spontaneously from CCoV-induced disease [2]. However, hypervirulent CCoV strains have been reported in the last years [3] and a pantropic variant [4] has been associated to systemic, sometimes fatal disease in pups under natural [5] and experimental conditions [6], [7], [8].",

These genotypes are variously distributed worldwide, with a predominance of CCoV-II in Europe [10] and Asia [11], [12]. In addition, CCoVs with a recombinant origin between CCoV-II and TGEV have been identified in the faeces of dogs with diarrhoea and have been found to be widespread in dogs populations. Accordingly, CCoV-II has been further classified into two subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, including \u201cclassical\u201d CCoVs and TGEV-like strains, respectively [13]. Subtype CCoV-IIb has been reported in several European countries [14], [15], as well as in Japan [12]. Limited antigenic cross-reactivity has been observed between subtype IIa and IIb CCoVs and this has raised some concerns about the real efficacy of the CCoV vaccines available in the market (prepared with subtype IIa) against the TGEV-like strains [13], [15].",

In the present study, virus 341/05 was used for vaccine preparation, whereas the Hungarian strain served as challenge virus. CCoV-IIb strain 341/05 was chosen as vaccine virus since it contains a 154-nucleotide deletion in ORF7b that could be used in the future as vaccine genetic marker, whereas strain174/06 was used as challenge virus since it had a distinct geographical origin. The two strains had been found to be strictly related at the genetic level, displaying a nucleotide identity of more than 96% in the nearly full-length genome [13].",

The dogs had tested negative for CCoV RNA by a real-time RT-PCR assay [23] carried out on the faeces and for CCoV antibodies by an ELISA test [24] carried out on serum samples. All dogs were housed individually in separate boxes, fed twice daily with a commercial dry dog food and provided water ad libitum. After an acclimatization period of one week, five animals (pups #1 to #5) were vaccinated by subcutaneous administration of two doses, three weeks apart (study days 0 and 21), of 1 mL of the experimental vaccine, whereas two dogs (pups #6 and #7) were maintained unvaccinated by receiving subcutaneously two doses of 1 mL of sterile saline solution (placebo).

Analogous CCoV strains, TGEV-like, have been identified about 40 years later in dead pups raised in Italy or imported from eastern Europe [13]. Upon genomic characterization, the virus was found to have a chimerical S gene, with the 5\u2032 end of the S gene being acquired from TGEV via recombination. Also, the virus was associated with a form of mild gastroenteritis in infected pups and it was named CCoV-IIb, in order to distinguish it from classical CCoV-II viruses (CCoV-IIa). Subsequent studies showed that CCoV-IIb is widespread in Europe with highest frequency of detection in eastern countries [15]. Limited antigenic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated between CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb and this has been hypothesised to account for a possible decreased efficacy of the current vaccines, based on inactivated CCoV-IIa strains, against TGEV-like CCoV strains [13], [15].",

By converse, an experimental modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine administered oronasally appeared to be able to prevent both CCoV disease and infection [27]. In this study, the inactivated CCoV-IIb vaccine, albeit not completely protective against the infection, was able to decrease markedly shedding of the challenge-virus, thus preventing the spread of virulent strains in the environment. A possible explanation for the good vaccine efficacy may rely on the MF59\u2122 adjuvant used in the formulation. MF59\u2122 is an oil-in-water formulation that contains surfactants (Tween 80 and Span 85), along with squalene emulsified under high-pressure conditions [29]. This adjuvant is satisfactorily included in the vaccines commonly used for prevention of seasonal and pandemic influenza [28]. The immune responses elicited by the MF59\u2122-adjuvanted CCoV-IIb vaccine, in terms of ELISA OD values and homologous VN antibody titres, were greater than those observed with an aluminium hydroxide-adjuvanted CCoV-IIa formulation [26] and comparable to experimental MLV vaccines [27]. The higher efficacy of the vaccines based on MF59\u2122 adjuvant is still largely unclear. Enhancement of the interaction between the antigen and the dendritic cell seems to be involved [28]. However, considering that the efficacy of commercially available CCoV vaccines was not evaluated in the present study, the claimed higher efficacy of the MF59\u2122-adjuvanted formulation may be biased by different ages and/or genetic backgrounds of the pups employed for the vaccination trials.",

            "text": "In dogs CCoV generally causes mild, self-limiting infections restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, CCoV vaccines are not considered as core vaccines and their use is discretional. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association currently does not recommend CCoV vaccination as the prevalence of CCoV-confirmed clinical cases is rather low [30]. However, the prevalence of CCoV-induced enteric disease in dogs is likely largely underrated, as diagnosis of CCoV infection requires specific tests that are not available in all the laboratories [2]. In addition, fatal diseases may occur as a consequence of mixed infections by CCoV and other canine pathogens, such as CPV-2, CAdV-1, or CDV [2]. Although it has never been proved that vaccination against CCoV reduces the severity of mixed infections, CCoV vaccination should be considered a priority in some settings, such as kennels and animal shelters, where CCoV is expected to circulate largely, mixed infections are common and animals are subjected to stress conditions, that may trigger the development of severe clinical forms. To date, there is still limited information on CCoV-IIb infection in dogs, but our findings seem to suggest that the pathogenetic patterns of this new CCoV subtype are similar to those observed for CCoV-IIa [13], [15]. Accordingly, similar prophylaxis strategies could be enacted to prevent and control CCoV-IIb-associated disease in dogs. The one-way antigenic cross-reactivity, already shown by neutralisation in vitro between CCoV-IIb and CCoV-IIa [13], was confirmed by the present study, as antibodies elicited against recombinant CCoV were able to cross-neutralise only partially the heterologous virus (CCoV-IIa). Based on these findings, as well as on the poor efficacy of aluminium hydroxide-adjuvanted formulations even against CCoV-IIa, it could be speculated that commercially available vaccines are not protective against CCoV-IIb. Therefore, it will be pivotal to assess whether and to which extent cross-protection occurs in vivo and whether CCoV-IIb (TGEV-like)-based vaccines may be developed for prevention of CCoV disease induced by both CCoV subtypes in dogs.",
