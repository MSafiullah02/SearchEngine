            "text": "According to Beck's 'World at Risk' theory, global risks push nations towards a cosmopolitisation of their health policy and open opportunities for a democratic turn. This article provides an empirical analysis of Beck's theory, based on the experience of Vietnamese authorities from 2003 to 2007 in managing the emerging avian flu virus. It shows how Vietnam's framing of avian flu has shifted, under the pressure from international organisations and the US administration, from an epizootic and zoonotic risk (or a classic risk) to a pandemic threat (or a late modern risk). Vietnam's response was part of its overall strategy to join the World Trade Organization and it was limited by Vietnam's defence of its sovereignty. This strategy has been successful for Vietnam but has limited the possibility of cosmopolitan and democratic transformations. The case study highlights the constructed dimension of risks of late modernity and their possible instrumentalisation: it minimises the role of a community of fear relative to a community of trade.",

This pressure is being exerted on countries with different perceptions of risks and with different agendas (Renn 2008, Taylor-Gooby and Zinn 2006) . In this article I examine how risks defined as 'global' by stakeholders in the international community push nations toward a cosmopolitisation of their risk management policies, together with the mechanisms used and the intended and unintended outcomes. I use Beck's World at Risk theory (Beck 2009 ) to study one empirical case: Vietnam's management of a recent emerging disease, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which is associated with the avian flu virus (H5N1), and popularly known as avian flu, avian influenza or bird flu. This study covers the period from 2003 to 2007, a period of intense international activity in avian flu management. I will discuss the link between global risks and cosmopolitisation, as identified by Beck. The following sections show how avian flu has been framed by international organisations and how Vietnam has complied with this definition, under pressure from the US administration and international organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) . I analyse the mechanisms of this convergence and its consequences for Vietnam. Finally, the discussion addresses the role of country reputation, national sovereignty, community of interests, community of fear and values as driving forces for a cosmopolitisation of health policy.",

In-depth interviews were conducted in 2007 and 2008 with key informants involved directly in Vietnamese avian flu management. In total, 20 people were interviewed, half of whom were working in public or private Vietnamese organisations (and representing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [MARD] , the Ministry of Health [MOH] and the veterinary services of two provinces, as well as representatives of the private sector). The other half were stakeholders from the international community (members of the FAO avian influenza team; experts in infectious diseases working for the WHO, members of the Partnership for Avian and Human Influenza (PAHI) , representatives of foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) active on the topic and one member of the leadership of an international hospital). Interviewees were asked to relate the role of the different stakeholders in the avian flu management over time and the major points of debates and controversies. Most interviews were conducted in English, with a few in Vietnamese through a translator. Interviewees were guaranteed anonymity. Some people have been interviewed twice or even three times. The interviews were recorded wherever possible and transcribed for further in-depth analysis. Additional information was collected from the websites of the FAO, OIE and WHO on avian flu and SARS, on the 'One World One Health' strategic framework adopted by these organisations, on the International Health Regulation of the WHO, and on the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of OIE.",

Consequently, late modern societies are confronted with a diversity of viewpoints and values from which risks can be evaluated. This situation creates the potential for new forms of risk governance involving a wide network of stakeholders and creating opportunities for an 'involuntary democratization' (Beck 2009: 60) .",

In response, Beck and his associates have developed the World at Risk theory (Beck 2009, Beck and Grande 2010) . They have introduced the concept of cosmopolitan modernities in order to take into account the varieties of modernity according to specific national cultures and histories and their global interdependencies. One of the main issues addressed by the World at Risk theory is: how do countries on different paths towards modernity, and with different risk perceptions, cooperate or not, in order to confront shared global risks? This question emphasises the realist dimension of global risk, since it opposes the diversities in risk perceptions to the nature of late modern risks. Beck has been criticised for the ambiguous status of risk in his theory. According to Burgess (2006) , in many works inspired by this theory, risks remain given, objectified and decontextualised, despite a proclaimed constructionist approach: their scientific and politically manufactured dimensions are often neglected. For Mythen (2007: 800, quoting Lash: 51) , 'so far as perceptions of risk are concerned Beck leans heavily towards the realist position'.",

As an epizootic or zoonotic disease, H5N1 is a classic risk. As a pandemic threat, avian flu is a risk of second modernity, according to Beck's definition. And that is the way international organisations have framed it.",

First, the management of this risk by international health organisations indicates 'a colonisation of the future', in the words of Beck (2003: 29) . It marks the unprecedented ambition of the institutions in charge of managing human and animal health risks to prepare the world for a virus that still does not exist but which could emerge from a mutation of H5N1. Secondly, the discourses produced by international organisations mark the end of a discourse that everything is under control. In a WHO handbook on avian flu published for journalists (WHO 2005b) one can read: 'the great unknown: why there are no certain answers for the big questions' (p. 4) as well as, throughout the text: 'we don't know' (p. 5), 'unpredictable' (p. 10), 'uncertain' (p. 10). Thirdly, H5N1 and SARS have opened the way for global health governance with an extended scope of intervention for international organisations and greater interference (see Calain 2007 for the WHO strategy). New WHO and OIE regulations encourage nations to go beyond routine measures on borders and to adopt preventive measures at the source of contamination, that is, within affected countries. Member states' obligations have been extended to the declaration of any 'extraordinary public health event which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and may require a coordinated international response' (WHO 2005c: 1). Lastly, the WHO and OIE are now authorised to take note of any information source on disease outbreaks in addition to official notifications from national administrations. Dr Chan, Director-General of WHO (2007a: xv), noted: 'This reflects a new reality in a world of instant communications: the concealment of disease outbreaks is no longer a viable option for governments'.",

This paradigm reflects what Beck calls a community of fate and a community of responsibility. But the current results are far from 'cosmopolitan moment' (Beck 2009: 47) in which nations see themselves as parts of a community of threat and fate and voluntarily contribute to global cooperation. According to Beck (2009: 57) global risks could open up 'a moral and political space that can give rise to a culture of responsibility that transcends borders and conflicts' but this opportunity has not been seized in the case of avian flu.",

Firstly, the rapidity of processes such as industrialisation, urbanisation and economic liberalisation, lead to the almost simultaneous development of first modernity and the transition to a second one, resulting in a compressed modernity ( Beck and Grande 2010 , Chang 2010 , Kyung-Sup 2010 . Secondly, 'global risks as a driving force of second modernity are more relevant in East Asia as a result of the side effects of the rush to development' (Han and Shim 2010: 465) . Thirdly, the economic and political transition has meant 'the protracted coexistence of socialist, capitalist or even (neo) traditionalist components of the political economy, thereby imposing an ultra-complex (compressed) modernity' as shown by Kyung-Sup (2010: 457) in analysing China.

Vietnam also lost considerable support following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the 1980s the domestic economic situation was a disaster, resulting in famines. In reaction, Vietnam implemented from 1986 important economic and political reforms (known as Doi Moi). At the international level Vietnam's objective was to become integrated in the international community. But according to Do Hien (2004: 171, my translation) , at that time, 'winning back the confidence of the international community was an almost impossible challenge'. Nevertheless, Vietnam succeeded within a relatively short time. The country started by restoring its relationship with China following the end of the conflict in Cambodia (1989) and then by amplifying its relations with neighbouring South-East Asian countries. Vietnam made an important gesture when it agreed to cooperate with the USA over the 'missing in action ' affair (1986) . This led to the lifting of the trade embargo (1994), after which Vietnam regained access to international credit (from the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund) and was integrated into the coalition of South-East Asian countries in 1995 (Do Hien 2004) . When avian flu emerged in Vietnam these successes were considered by Vietnamese authorities as steps towards a longer term objective: Vietnam's integration into the World Trade Organization.",

The population's anxiety receded: consumers resumed poultry consumption after a dramatic drop (Figuie\u00b4and Fournier 2008) and poultry farmers finally perceived avian flu as just another epizootic disease ( Desvaux and Figuie\u00b42011) .

In 2005 the number of countries notifying H5N1 to the OIE increased dramatically and the virus reached Europe (with the first human cases in Europe occurring in Turkey in January 2006), increasing the pandemic threat for western countries. The same year the US Congress commissioned an assessment of the actions undertaken by the international community and by the main countries affected by the virus, including Vietnam. The report underlined numerous inadequacies in the surveillance and control of the virus. In line with the lessons learned from terrorist attacks, the US government was now convinced that it should not rely for homeland security solely on the surveillance and the protection of its own territory but that it had to increase its involvement at the international level to manage the sources of threat (Congressional Research Service [CRS] 2006) . In September 2005 US President George W. Bush, addressing the United Nations World Summit, announced his country's decision to invest in and coordinate the formation of a new international partnership aimed at preventing an influenza pandemic. The President required all countries to be transparent on their epidemiological status (Bush 2005) .",

New laws were produced with the assistance of the FAO and OIE (MARD and MOH 2010) . The participation of the private sector became more widely solicited. Through new regulations, new hygiene standards, a credit policy and even local tax policies, the government consistently promoted the development of a modern industrial poultry farming sector to the detriment of small-scale farming (ACI 2007). The state even passed the role of public health protection, traditionally its own responsibility (in particular in communist countries) onto the private sector, by a Health Ministry radio announcement in which people were told, 'If you don't want to catch the virus, buy your poultry at the supermarket'.",

Following the deregulatory market reforms of 1986, provincial authorities gained new economic power and autonomy from the central government. Tuong (2010) has shown that the management of avian flu became an opportunity for the central government to affirm its authority, regardless of the local reality (as with the authoritarian imposition of massive culling measures). Central authorities used avian flu to blame local authorities for all mismanagement, pointing to their incompetence and corruption. The media presented the victory over the virus as a question of national honour and as popular mobilisation behind the Party against a new common enemy (Gue\u00b4nel and Klingberg 2010, Tuong 2010) .",

Vietnam had yet to complete bilateral negotiations with the USA in order to obtain the status of a permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) nation from the US Congress (for more details see the US Association of Southeast Asian Nations Business Council 2006).

Firstly, in the field many regulations adopted by the authorities were not applied or were applied for a short period only. For example, a ban on duck breeding has never been applied and live poultry markets, however much they were prohibited, have quickly resumed.

This demonstrates the varieties of modernity.

Vietnam currently ranks second in human deaths from H5N1 (352 deaths, WHO 2012) and numerous poultry outbreaks are still being recorded (World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] 2012).I identify two phases in Vietnam's management of the virus. The first began with the first outbreaks of the virus in Vietnam; the second began with the arrival of the virus in Europe and the globalisation of its management.Phase 1: avian flu, a classic risk The first phase began at the end of 2003 and the start of 2004. It was a consequence of a local epidemic (in which up to nine cases of human contamination per month were being recorded), as well as the number of infected flocks (as many as 25 per cent of Vietnamese communes had contaminated poultry flocks). Avian flu was rapidly compared with SARS by experts and the media, who feared an explosive increase in human cases. The SARS virus had emerged in China in 2002, reaching Vietnam and going on to kill 774 people throughout the world in a few months. The daily newspaper Thanh Nien (2004: 1) published the following headline: 'a flu epidemic even more dangerous than SARS'.",
