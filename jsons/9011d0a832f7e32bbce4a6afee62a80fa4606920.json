Turkey coronavirus (TCV) from two sources was studied, one isolate (NC95) was embryo propagated, the second was TCV infected material from turkeys diagnosed with poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). Beetles were fed virus-infected feces mixed with chicken feed. Transmission of virus was effectively halted by surface sterilization of the beetles. Turkey poults administered beetle homogenates infected with TCV\u03e9 PEMS that had not been surface sterilized had reduced weight gains and 50% mortality. Mortality and weight gains were not effected in the NC95 group. Virus isolation procedures were performed to determine NC95 viability at varying time intervals. Beetles were dissected and the guts removed 1, 12, and 24 h after the initial viral feeding. Whole beetles were also examined for comparison. Whole beetles and beetle guts were homogenized and injected into turkey eggs for embryo propagation. Direct immuno\u00dfuorescence was used to determine the presence of TCV. A. diaperinus were capable of mechanical transmission of TCV. However, only turkey embryos receiving whole beetle and beetle gut homogenates within 1 h of feeding on the virus were positive for TCV. Laboratory studies demonstrating PEMS transmission by A. diaperinus are continuing.",

After 1971, there occurred a dramatic drop in incidence with \u03fd1% mortality. The last TCV outbreak was controlled by depopulation, followed by disinfection of the facility, and a rest period before repopulation.

Since the disease \u00derst appeared, PEMS research has focused on its cause and identifying methods of prevention, control, and treatment. Studies have demonstrated the disease is highly infectious, and although the cause of PEMS remains unknown, it is believed that the disease may be a complex of etiologic agents.

Using turkey embryo to isolate virus directly from beetle gut or whole beetle provided a more direct diagnosis of the presence of TCV by reducing competitive organisms that may interfere or confound the results. Previous studies indicate that TCV was detectable by direct immuno\u00dfuorescence (FA) by day 3 after inoculation (Guy et al. 1997) . Inoculated embryos were dissected and the intestines examined for presence of TCV. Immuno\u00dfuorescence detected the presence of virus in embryonic tissues inoculated with beetles euthanized 1 h after feeding on NC95 infected feces. No virus was found in beetle inoculated embryonic tissues for time intervals 12 and 24 h ( Table 2) . No virus was found in the negative control groups.",

The agent may be transported on the cuticle or exoskeleton of the insect, or may be ingested by the insect to be retained in a viable state as it passes through the insect gut. In this study we found that surface sterilization of the insect effectively eliminated TCV from the exoskeleton of the insect. Turkey poults infected with embryo-propagated TCV (NC95) and TCV from PEMS affected turkeys had reduced weight gains when compared with the control groups. Turkeys administered surface sterilized virus infected beetles did not suffer a reduction in weight gains, nor did they test positive by either the FA or serology. Although birds inoculated with unsterilized beetle homogenates in NC95 group did not experience a reduction in weight, one of six birds had converted serologically. Experimental studies with isolate NC95 demonstrated that the virus did not produce clinically apparent disease (Guy et al. 1999) . In our study viable virus (NC95) was either not present or perhaps below detectable levels in the beetle gut 24 h after feeding on infected feces, suggesting that the beetle gut was environmentally inhospitable for the virus. Further examination of the viability of NC95 indicated the virus remained active in beetle guts and on whole beetles (unsterilized) for 1 h but was no longer viable after 12 h. The implications of these results are evident. A. diaperinus may well be involved in the transmission of TCV within a turkey house in which an active outbreak has occurred where beetles and birds are in close contact. However, it is less likely to transmit disease upon immigrating from \u00deeld soils to a turkey house after the land application of litter.",

Turkey poults infected with TCV\u03e9 feces from PEMS affected turkeys had reduced weight gains when compared with the control group. Turkeys administered unsterilized beetles in the TCV\u03e9PEMS group had reduced weight gains similar to that of the positive control group and tested positive in the FA test and serologically. Therefore, the agent(s) contributing to PEMS appear to be viable on the surface of A. diaperinus for at least 24 h. Although, the results of our second experiment indicated TCV was fastidious, some virus particles in the PEMS \u03e9 inoculum must have remained viable and gained purchase to be serologically detectable. The insect exoskeleton or perhaps fecal material adhering to the exoskeleton may have provided suf\u00decient harborage to protect the agent(s). Although the etiology of PEMS remains unsettled this study further supports the theory that PEMS may involve a complex of organisms. Conclusive evidence of the role of A. diaperinus and other insects in the transmission of PEMS depends on the more complete characterization of the etiologic agent.
