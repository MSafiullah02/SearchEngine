The S proteins of majority of coronaviruses are cleaved into two functional subunits, S1 and S2. Liu et al. [1] indicated that the S protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) also forms S1 and S2 domains. The peripheral S1 portion is responsible for cellular receptor recognition, while the membrane-spanning S2 portion mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membrane, hence S protein determines the specificity of host and virulence of coronavirus [2]. Similarly, there are two non-valently associated subunits in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein, gp120 and gp41, gp120 directs target-cell recognition and viral tropism through interaction with the cell-surface receptor CD4, while the membrane-spanning gp41 promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes so that viral contents are released into the host cell [3].",

Three templates were used to generate 3D model of S2. The quality evaluation of these models was conducted by proq program in which two measurements (ProQ-LG and ProQ-MX) were used. The corresponding scores are below: ProQ-LG=0.583 and ProQ-MX=0.026 for 1dg3_A, ProQ-LG=1.409 and ProQ-MX=0.034 for 1f5n_A, ProQ-LG=2.503 and ProQ-MX=0.106 for 1ezf_A. In view of the fact that cutoffs for \u2018correct model\u2019 are ProQ-LG>1.5 or ProQ-MX>0.1, so the \u2018correct\u2019 model for S2 is the model built on template 1ezf_A, although other templates obtained marginally higher 3D scores. The alignment between S2 and template 1ezf_A with ClustalW [10] and secondary structure of S2 predicted by PsiPred v2.3 [11] are displayed in Table 1\n. Fig. 1\nshows that the 3D model of S2 subunit is primarily consisted of \u03b1 helices. In fact, Liu et al. [1] predicted the secondary structure of S protein by eight techniques and found that there are nine successive alpha-helices in S2. Based on the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids alternately, they speculated that these helices could be the amphipathic alpha-helices, which collapse into coiled-coils, bring a fusion peptide back toward the transmembrane domain and lead to the fusion of cellular and viral membranes [2].",
