It is estimated that there were more than 500,000 hospital admissions in the United States in 2009 from pneumonia. Whereas pneumonia managed as an outpatient is a less severe disease, pneumonia requiring hospitalization is associated with approximately 15% mortality. Pneumonia is often a complication of a preexisting condition or infection such as influenza. The 2009 national vital statistics identified pneumonia and influenza as the eighth leading cause of death.1 Pneumonia consistently accounts for most of these deaths. Close to 90% of the deaths attributed to pneumonia occur in the population older than 65 years. In this cohort, pneumonia and influenza combine as the seventh leading cause of death.2, 3\n",

A meta-analysis has shown the use of sputum Gram stain to have low yield.18 The initial limitation is that less than 50% of patients do not produce an adequate sample. Despite this finding, when a sputum sample has more than 25 polymorphonuclear cells per low-power field and there is a predominant organism, the causative organism is identified in more than 80% of cases. The interpretation of the sputum culture is also problematic. For properly handled samples the sensitivity is approximately 75%. This sensitivity is lower if antibiotics therapy has been started before the sample is taken. In addition, because of the possibility of culturing bacteria that colonize the oropharynx, false-positive results may occur. This finding is especially true for debilitated patients, who are more likely to be colonized with pathogens. However, certain organisms are always pathogenic and can be assumed to be causing disease if they are identified. These organisms include Legionella species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the endemic fungi.19\n",
