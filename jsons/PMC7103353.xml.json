            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA particles that are responsible for enteric and/or respiratory disease in mammals and birds. Their ability to evolve through genetic recombination and/or point mutation is well-known so that they give rise to new viral genotypes or mutants with different tissue or host tropism. Currently, CoVs are organized into three antigenic groups with group 2 including bovine-like (subgroup 2a) and SARS-like (subgroup 2b) viruses. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) belongs to subgroup 2a together with mouse hepatitis virus, sialodacryadenitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43, human enteric coronavirus (HECV) 4408 (Enjuanes et al., 2000) and the newly recognized equine coronavirus (ECoV) (Guy et al., 2000), HCoV-HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005), and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Decaro et al., 2007a, Erles et al., 2003). There are multiple genetic and antigenic evidences that several subgroup 2a CoVs, such as HCoV-OC43, HECV-4408, PHEV and CRCoV, have arisen as a consequence of trans-species infections caused by BCoV (Zhang et al., 1994, Vijgen et al., 2005, Vijgen et al., 2006, Erles et al., 2007). BCoV can cause severe diarrhea in newborn calves (Snodgrass et al., 1986), \u201cwinter dysentery\u201d in adult cows (Cho et al., 2000, Saif et al., 1991) and respiratory tract illness in calves and cows (Lathrop et al., 2000, Storz et al., 2000). The same virus strain could be responsible for simultaneous appearance of enteric and respiratory disease in the same animals (Chouljenko et al., 2001) as well as in both calves and cows (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001). BCoV infection is responsible for severe economic losses in cattle herds due to decreased milk production in dairy cows and reduced weight gain in beef calves (Saif et al., 1998), with generally low mortality rates.",

            "text": "Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) represents a ruminant species important in the economy of several countries, including Brazil, India, Vietnam and some regions of southern Italy, where the breed Mediterranean Italian buffalo produces high quality milk employed for production of the buffalo \u201cmozzarella cheese\u201d (Romano et al., 2001). Recently, bovine-like CoVs have been identified in wild or domesticated ruminants, including several species of deer, waterbuck antelope (Tsunemitsu et al., 1995), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) (Hasoksuz et al., 2007), alpaca (Lama pacos) (Jin et al., 2007) and sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) (Spiro D., R. Halpin, S. Wang, M. Hasoksuz, X. Zhang, K. Alekseev, A. Vlasova, D. Janies, E. Ghedin, and L. Saif, unpublished). However, CoVs have never been isolated from buffaloes, although there is a single report on the detection of BCoV antibodies in Bulgarian buffaloes by hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization tests (Muniiappa et al., 1985). In the same report, hemagglutinating activity which could be suppressed by a BCoV-specific bovine serum was also demonstrated in some bubaline fecal samples. In this paper, we describe the isolation and biological and genomic characterization of a bovine-like coronavirus from a buffalo herd affected by severe diarrhea and calf mortality.",

Buffalo calves were removed from their dams shortly after their birth and placed in separate hutches according to the gender where they were hand-fed fresh colustrum for 5 days. Neonatal mortality was firstly observed in October 2006 in 30 5- to 20-day-old calves (out of 40 newborns) that displayed severe diarrhea and died despite treatment with antibiotics (oxytetracyclin and amoxicillin). Simultaneously, gastroenteric disease was also observed in older calves (1\u20133 months of age). On April 2007, neonatal mortality and enteric signs in calves persisted and two carcasses of 20-day-old dead calves together with fecal samples from additional 17 diseased calves were submitted to our laboratory for routine analysis.",

At the 5th passage on HRT cells the viral titer reached values of 106.25 TCID50/50 \u03bcl of viral suspension and 1.97 \u00d7 108 RNA copies/ml of template, as calculated by the Karber's method and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Replication of strain 179/07-11 in MDBK cells was not as efficient as in HRT-18 cells, considering that CPE was not observed on MDBK monolayers and only few positive cells were detected by the IF assay at the 1st passage, with viral titers (as calculated by real-time RT-PCR) decreasing progressively in the subsequent passages until definitive loss of the replication ability. MDBK cells were confirmed to be poorly permissive to 179/07-11 replication even when the HRT-18 cell-cultured virus was inoculated.",

The predicted 32-kDa nonstructural protein (nsp) had the same length (278 aa) as most other bovine-like CoVs, including ruminant CoVs giraffe coronavirus (GiCoV), alpaca coronavirus (ACoV) and sable antelope coronavirus (SACoV), as well as CRCoV and HCoV-OC43. Three aa changes were found to be unique to strain 179/07-11. The highest aa identity (98.9%) of the 32-kDa protein of strain 179/07-11 was found to enteric and respiratory BCoVs, as well as to ACoV. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein (424 aa) showed three unique aa mutations in comparison with other ruminant CoVs and it was more closely related (99% aa identity) to BCoVs DB2 and ENT and SACoV. By analysis with the NetNglyc server, the HE of strain 179/07-11 was found to contain nine potential N-glycosylation sites, analogously to BCoV reference strains. Moreover, the predicted site for neuraminidate-O-acetylesterase activity, FGDS, was detected at the N-terminus. The spike (S) protein was long 1363 aa and matched the best aa identity (98.1%) to BCoV-E-AH65 and SACoV-US/OH1/03. Twenty-one potential N-glycosylation sites were identified throughout the protein, one more than other ruminant CoVs, due to the presence of an additional N-glycosylation site, NLS, at position 1260. No deletions or insertions were observed in strain 179/07-11 compared with bovine-like CoVs. Also, the aa stretch KRRSRR, responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein at residue 768 into subunits S1 and S2, was conserved. In comparison to ruminant CoV reference strains, 16 unique residues were identified in the S protein of strain 179/07-11. Nsp 4.9 kDa was 43-aa long as for BCoVs Mebus, Quebec and DB2 and HECV-4408, whereas in other ruminant CoVs it is truncated in the C-terminus (only 29 aa in length). The length of nsp 4.8 kDa was 45 aa as for HECV-4408 and ruminant CoVs with the exception of GiCoV and SACoV (38 aa). Nsp 12.7 kDa showed the same size as for HECV-4408 and ruminant CoVs (109 aa), although BCoV Quebec exhibits a truncate form of the protein (87 aa). In the three nonstructural proteins, strain 179/07-11 displayed the highest identity to HECV-4408, with three, seven and one unique residues in nsp 4.9 kDa, 4.8 kDa and 12.7 kDa, respectively. The envelope (E) protein was 84-aa long exactly as BCoV and GiCoV but 1-aa shorter and 2-aa longer than the analogous protein of ACoV and SACoV, respectively. No residue unique to the bubaline strain was detected at this level. A 100% aa identity in the E protein was found between the bubaline strain and GiCoV and most BCoV strains, with the exception of BCoV-Mebus (98.8%), whereas the bubaline isolate was slightly less related to ACoV and SACoV. The membrane (M) protein was 220-aa long and contained two unique residues, with the I58L change shared with HECV-4408. In this protein the highest identity (99.5%) was matched to HECV-4408. One potential N-glycosylation and four potential O-glycosylation sites were detected at the N-terminus of the M protein, as for all bovine-like CoVs including the closely related HECV-4408, with which the bubaline isolates shared an aa mutation with respect to other ruminant CoVs. However, both programs indicated that M gene sequence of the ruminant CoVs might not contain a signal peptide. Proteins without signal peptides are unlikely to be exposed to the O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation machineries and thus may not be glycosylated in vivo even though they contain potential motifs. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of strain 179/07-11 had a length of 448 aa and was closely related (99.3% of aa identity) to BCoV-DB2. Two unique aa changes were found in comparison to other bovine-like viruses. The I protein (207 aa) encoded by the N-gene internal ORF showed four unique residues and the best aa identity (96.1%) to BCoV reference strains Mebus, Quebec and DB2. When the 9.6-kb sequence corresponding to the 3\u2032 end of CoV genome was analyzed, the bubaline strain showed over 97.6% nt identity to BCoV strains and other ruminant CoVs, whereas it was less genetically related to other bovine-like CoVs, including CRCoV (96.5% nt identity), HCoV-OC43 (91.4%), HECV-4408 (85.1%) and PHEV-VW572 (83.1%).",

For such a comparison, strain ENT was chosen among the available BCoV sequences as it is an enteric strain isolated very recently (Chouljenko et al., 2001). The results showed that strain 179/07-11 is less related to BCoV-ENT than to other ruminant CoVs in all major structural and nonstructural proteins, whereas closer relationship (98.8% aa identity) to BCoV-ENT with respect to SACoV (97.6% aa identity) was found only in the E protein. Analysis of the nt sequence corresponding to the entire 3\u2032 end of CoV genome confirmed that the bubaline strain has a lower genetic relationship (97.8% nt identity) to the reference BCoV than other recently isolated ruminant CoVs (99.1\u201399.3% nt identity).

The bubaline strain was detected in the feces of buffalo calves with severe gastroenteritis, causing the death of at least 30 animals. A virus (strain 179/07-11) antigenically related to BCoV was isolated on HRT-18 cells, producing CPE typical of BCoV and being recognized by a BCoV-specific serum in an IF assay. Analysis of the biological properties of the bubaline strain showed that, unlike classical BCoV strains (Fukutomi et al., 1999), the virus was not able to replicate efficiently on MDBK cells or cause hemagglutination with chicken erythrocytes. However, Benfield and Saif (1990) demonstrated that winter dysentery strains of BCoV from adult cattle were also unable to replicate in MDBK cells. Among wild ruminant CoVs, only few strains have been characterized at a biological level. GiCoV displayed HA activity also with chicken erythrocytes at a temperature of 4 \u00b0C, whereas no data are available about its replication efficiency on MDBK cells (Hasoksuz et al., 2007). Using chicken erythrocytes, other ruminant CoVs, including the waterbuck, sambar deer and white-tailed deer isolates and some BCoV strains, exhibited very low HA titers at 4 \u00b0C and no HA activity at 37 \u00b0C. Thus, the loss of ability to replicate on MDBK cells and to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes appears as characteristic of the bubaline CoV with respect to the other ruminant CoVs.",

Moreover, the virus has a close genetic relatedness to the bovine CoV subgroup in the major structural and nonstructural proteins. However, as shown by sequence and SimPlot analyses, the genetic distance between the bubaline virus and reference BCoV strain ENT was approximately the same or even higher than observed between the BCoV strain and other ruminant CoVs. Unique aa substitutions were detected in all proteins of the bubaline virus but they were mainly within the S protein (Table 4). As observed in BCoV (Chouljenko et al., 1998), GiCoV (Hasoksuz et al., 2007) and ACoV (Jin et al., 2007), these changes occurred mostly in the S1 subunit which has been proven to be involved in receptor binding and host specificity in the well-characterized MHV (de Haan et al., 2006). Certain residues in the S protein had been associated to enteric or respiratory tropism of BCoV, including residues 531, 769 and 1026 (Chouljenko et al., 1998). The bubaline strain displayed the same aa residues encountered in enteric BCoVs in only one position (D531). The remaining two aa residues (S769, G1026) suggest a potential respiratory tropism, which is in contrast with the exclusive enteric clinical pattern observed in water buffalo. However, more recent analysis of two enteric and respiratory BCoV pairs failed to identify specific aa residue determinants in the S proteins as well as in other structural and nonstructural proteins, except for a T22I mutation in nsp 4.8 kDa (Zhang et al., 2007). Interestingly, strain 179/07-11 showed the same aa determinant T22 as the enteric BCoV strains. Other authors have identified a truncated form of nsp 4.9 kDa (29 instead of 43 aa) as a genetic marker for the respiratory tropism (Gelinas et al., 2001, Vijgen et al., 2006). The bubaline strain presented an intact nsp 4.9 kDa as enteric BCoVs, but even this aa deletion has been recently shown not to be involved in tissue tropism (Zhang et al., 1994).",

With regard to the its possible origin, BuCoV may have arisen through interspecies transmission of a BCoV strain from cattle to water buffaloes, although no recent contacts with cattle or other ruminants were reported. This hypothesis is supported by the high genetic relatedness between BuCoV and BCoV. Moreover, it should be considered that a bovine origin has been strongly suggested for other group 2 CoVs less genetically related to BCoV, such as HCoV-OC43 (Vijgen et al., 2005), PHEV (Vijgen et al., 2006) and CRCoV (Erles et al., 2007).",

Coronaviruses are thought to mutate at high frequency like most RNA viruses as a consequence of high error rates of the RNA polymerase that are predicted to accumulate several base substitutions per round of replication (Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1991, Lai and Holmes, 2001). Changes in tissue tropisms and/or interspecies transmission of CoVs occur through genetic variations in structural and/or nonstructural proteins (Laude et al., 1993, Vennema et al., 1998, Guan et al., 2003, Rottier et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005, Vijgen et al., 2005, Decaro et al., 2007c). Genetic determinants that may have caused the cattle-to-buffalo interspecies transmission have not been identified so far. Although this study has detected a CoV strain in buffalo calves with severe diarrhea, the pathogenicity of this virus and its etiologic role in enteric disease of water buffalo still have to be determined more definitively. In addition, epidemiological studies could assess whether BuCoV is widespread among water buffalo herds as well as whether cross-species transmission between buffalo and cattle occurs mainly in areas where both closely related ruminant species are raised intensively.",
