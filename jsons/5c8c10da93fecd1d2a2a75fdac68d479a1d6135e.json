In the last 10 years, many national and international guidelines on the treatment of pediatric CAP have been published, in order to optimize the prescription of antibiotics and limit their cost and side effects. However, the practical implementation of these guidelines is still limited. Main Text. We analyzed the current recommendations for the therapy of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that all converge on the identification of aminopenicillins and beta-lactams as the optimal treatment for CAP. We also conducted a review of the current literature on antibiotic regimens used for pediatric CAP to identify the current state of guidelines implementation in different settings. We selected 37 studies published from 2010 to 2016, including both retrospective and prospective studies, mainly cross-sectional and hospital based. The results show a global heterogeneity in the antibiotics prescription for pediatric CAP, with application of guidelines varying from 0% to more than 91% and with important differences even within the same country. Conclusions. Our review has demonstrated that the implementation of the guidelines is still limited but also that achieving the optimal prescription is possible and can be done in both developed and developing countries.",

The incidence of CAP is lower in developed countries: in the US it is about 35-40/1000/personyears in children < 5 years old, 20/1000 person-years in children 5-10 years old, and 10/1000 person-years in children > 10 years old. Despite this, approximately 50% of children with CAP < 5 years old, 20% between 5-10 years old, and 10% of children > 10 years old need to be hospitalized [5] .

S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the commonest bacterial pathogens isolated in children under five years with CAP accounting for 30%-50% and 10%-30%, respectively [9] . Around 50% of deaths due to pneumonia are attributable to these organisms [10] . Viral etiology has been documented in up to 80% of CAP cases in children younger than 2 years and much less in older children (10-16 years) . The most frequently identified viral pathogen in younger children is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), rarely detected in older children. Less frequent are Adenoviruses, Bocavirus, Human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A and B Viruses, Parainfluenza Viruses, Coronaviruses, and Rhinovirus. Up to 33% of hospitalized children are simultaneously infected by 2 or more viruses. Mixed infections (both of viral and bacterial etiology) have been documented in 2-50% of children with CAP, more frequently in inpatients, which are more seriously ill than outpatients [3, 11] .",

Therefore, amoxicillin administered every 8 hours maintains blood and lung concentrations that are above S. pneumoniae MIC for enough time to allow S. pneumoniae eradication. A longer interval between administrations (every 12 hours), in case of intermediate resistant serotypes, would not permit having a sufficient antimicrobial plasma concentration [28] .

Through the different guidelines, amoxicillin daily dose varies from 40-50 mg/kg to 90-100 mg/kg, with higher dosage recommended in areas with higher risk for International Journal of Pediatrics antibiotic-resistant serotype, as in the US [13, 19] . In the same way, for inpatient parenteral therapy, higher doses of penicillin G or ampicillin are recommended [13] . The only two guidelines which suggest an aminopenicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor as first line are the Taiwan Pediatric Working Group and Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria de Atencion Primaria [29, 30] . Unlike the first one, in which aminopenicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate) is suggested as first-line therapy for all children treated as outpatient, the Spanish guidelines recommend coamoxiclav only for children who are not fully immunized with conjugate vaccines for type B H. influenzae and for S. pneumoniae. Indeed, this population is at increased risk to develop a CAP by aggressive S. pneumoniae serotypes and other less common organisms, as H. influenza. Unlike Pneumococcus, type B and nontypeable H. influenzae became resistant to penicillin through the production of -lactamase. Therefore, treatment with the association of amoxicillin with a -lactamase inhibitor ensures a broader coverage [30] . It should be noted that the addition of alactamase inhibitor does not change the amoxicillin kinetic curve; as a consequence, in order to treat a pneumococcal infection with the association of amoxicillin with clavulanate, the therapy should be administered every 8 hours [26] .",

On the other hand, all CA-MRSA strains are susceptible to vancomycin, which is considered by all guidelines as the drug of choice if MRSA is suspected [7, 13] . Although linezolid has been recently demonstrated as efficient as vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia, its use should be considered as a second-line treatment for cost consideration (linezolid costs >10 times more than vancomycin) and because linezolid-resistant MRSA has already been described [46, 47] .

The study by Awor et al. in Uganda in 2015 offers an important cause for reflection, since it shows that adherence to guidelines may be successfully implemented even in a nonhospital environment. In their 8-month quasiexperimental analysis, they investigated the visits and the prescriptions made by drug shop sellers, underlining how this class of health workers plays an important role in providing healthcare to populations in rural areas.
