            "text": "This study explores how the different nature of living space affects housing prices. In Hong Kong, buildable space is limited due to topographic constraints and government planning policy. These limitations have led to a high-density and compact design solution for housing as well as the other urban developments (Zaman, Lau, & So, 2000). Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with an overall population density of over 6350 persons/km2 where Kwun Tong District had about 52,123 persons/km2 (Census and Statistics Department, 2007) and 194,178 domestic households in 2006 (Census and Statistics Department, 2006). Urban space is at a premium. As a result, there are always arguments in favour of and against compact urban form. Such a development model is often praised for its efficient utilization of precious urban land because a large number of residents can share the common space and facilities within mass housing estates. However, a high concentration of residents also results in a very congested environment. Some past studies claim that compactness may induce adverse effects under reduced domestic living space (Brotchie, 1992; Forster, 1994; Stretton, 1996) and poorer access to green space (Breheny, 1992; Knight, 1996; Stretton, 1994). Home buyers are willing to pay for desired attributes such as more floor area, access to park, access to facilities, and nice view. But they are also forced to pay for common space and facilities that have to be shared with other households.",

In Hong Kong, all land is leasehold. The Hong Kong government exerts control on private development through land sales and planning control mechanisms. Private housing land is sold to developers through auctions and tenders. The land price is the highest cost component in private housing development. Hence, private developers try to maximize their profits by maximizing the saleable area. The extremely high population results in a majority of the residents living in higher-density housing development. In general, these multi-storey housing blocks are associated with smaller dwelling units for the mass population whereas the lower-density housing development can afford to have comparatively larger and spacious units for the higher-income households (Chan, Tang, & Wong, 2002).",

More than half of the housing units (55.3%) are produced by private housing sector (Census and Statistics Department, 2007). Public housing blocks have been built using the standard block designs.1\nThe most frequently used standard block designs are: (1) the New Cruciform [for Home Ownership Scheme (HOS)]; (2) the Harmony One (for rental housing); and (3) the Concord (for HOS) (Fig. 2\n). Another block design is developed with private developers under the Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS), with a higher efficiency ratio (ER) (Audit Commission, 2001). Households of all these block designs have to share a common area. Hong Kong private housing development is also remarkable with similar building layout of public housing. A typical building layout comprises a large number of housing units clustered around a cruciform core sharing a common area by the households. This central core contains lifts, services and stairs (Fig. 3\n).",

Furthermore, the \u201csaleable area\u201d concept in Hong Kong includes a portion of common area or mechanical plant room that is not used for the exclusive use of the flat owners.

There has been a long-term confusion about the exact measurements of \u2018gross floor area\u2019 (GFA) and \u2018saleable area\u2019 of a housing unit. Some developers cite GFA, which the Government defines to include all roofed areas, the area within the walls, the thickness of walls and apportion of common areas such as corridors, staircases, lift lobbies and the ground floor areas. Others interpret \u2018saleable area\u2019 to include also a share of external facilities such as gardens and car parks. The Government exempts some areas from the GFA calculation in order to encourage developers to build better public facilities and more spacious design for the housing developments. In fact, developers have to pay a very small amount for the construction cost for these exempt areas as compared with a huge amount for the land premium. This unclear measurement is mainly because the developers are including unidentifiable portion of floor area into the GFA calculation for the purpose of flat sale. Moreover, the final \u201csaleable\u201d GFA approved by the Buildings Department is always more than the GFA stated in the land lease documents. It is mainly because some floor areas, for example, plant rooms, are exempted from the GFA calculation, but some of the developers will include these exempted floor area into the GFA for the flat selling purpose. For example, a low-density housing development in Tai Po Kau was found to have a saleable area stated in the sale brochure exceeding about 10% (1233 ft2) of the accountable GFA under the land lease (Asia Television Ltd., 2000). It is difficult to have a clear picture about the actual size of the internal floor space of the housing units simply by judging from the GFA figures provided by the developers and subsequently registered with the Land Registry.",

            "text": "This study argues that different distribution of housing space will command different values from the housing buyers. Our key argument is that, notwithstanding the confusion in measuring housing flat size in Hong Kong, home buyers are not myopic in relying entirely on the GFA figures which are stated by the developers and registered in the Land Registry. In the secondary housing market, the buyers have the opportunity to inspect the flats and determine whether the \u201cstated\u201d floor space measurements are reasonable or not. There are two major types of measurement. The first one is GFA which has been fully elaborated above. The second one is net floor area (NFA) which is commonly conceived of as a measure of private internal space, net of the shared portion of external space included in the respective GFA, of a particular housing unit. Although this is a common understanding, there is no statutory and standardized definition of NFA. Therefore, there is still a possibility that the NFA may also be inaccurate. However, this study argues that, despite its possible imprecision, the NFA figure is likely to act as a better reference to home buyers than the GFA figure. It is natural to expect that, in a residential purchase decision, home buyers will put emphasis on the amount of internal space within the housing unit. The NFA figure is supposed to provide a better proxy of the internal space exclusively enjoyed by the buyers. When a prospective buyer inspects a housing unit, he can make a judgment about whether the stated NFA figure is indeed a reasonable measure of the internal space he is paying for.",

Based upon the above arguments, this study will examine the following hypotheses. First, a buyer is willing to pay more for a higher amount of internal space that he can exclusively enjoy. This implies that the NFA is expected to be more accountable for the housing price than the GFA. The higher is the amount of internal space, the higher will be the housing price, ceteris paribus. Second, a buyer is expected to be less willing to pay for the shared space. In other words, shared space is expected to exert a downward pressure on the housing price. The higher is the amount of shared space, the lower will be the housing price, ceteris paribus. Third, shared space may exist in different forms and a buyer is expected to be willing to pay for some \u2018desirable\u2019 shared space. For example, clubhouse is a kind of shared space which is desirable to the households within a housing development. Thus, a positive relationship between \u2018desirable\u2019 shared space and housing price is expected.",

The ability to place values quantitatively on the benefits generated by green spaces is becoming essential to the urban planners and developers. One of the methods to measure the economic benefits of green space to communities is to measure their impacts on the surrounding property prices. This approach assumes that the benefits (in terms of positive and negative externalities) of green space proximity are capitalized into property prices. Home buyers are willing to pay premiums for locations offering easy physical access to green spaces and the benefits they provide.",

In the first analysis, the NFA and the GFA are applied in two separate models: MODEL_NET (using NFA as independent variable) and MODEL_GROSS (using GFA as independent variable). In Hong Kong, housing unit is sold in terms of the gross price per square foot (selling price divided by the GFA). However, it is argued that house buyers are more sensitive to NFA rather than GFA. We hypothesize that home buyers are more willing to pay for a housing unit with a higher NFA, ceteris paribus. When they buy the housing units, they will perceive NFA as one of their preferences but not the GFA, as most developers only provide data on GFA and some calculations of the GFA are ambiguous. Therefore, in the first analysis, GFA and NFA are applied as independent variable, respectively, in two separate models (MODEL_NET and MODEL_GROSS) with the same combination of other variables. This shows the impacts made by GFA and NFA separately on the housing price. By comparing these two models, we are able to compare the coefficients of GFA and NFA, and to determine whether internal space is a better estimator of housing prices. In the subsequent analysis, we will examine how different attributes of floor area provision may affect housing prices. These attributes include the different levels of total shared space, the amount of \u2018desirable\u2019 shared space such as clubhouse and the possible exaggeration of internal floor space.",

To ensure consistency, the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors (HKIS) has reviewed and revised the existing code of measuring practice. The HKIS proposed revising its current \u201cCode of Measuring Practice of Saleable Area\u201d so that the saleable area3\nof a unit would be measured in two parts, namely saleable area (Type A) and saleable area (Type B). Type A would refer to the saleable area which is roofed of full headroom and is available for full normal occupation. Type B, however, would refer to areas of cockloft (of clear headroom less than 2 m); bay window, yard/terrace/garden/flat roof/car park; car parking space; and plant room. The HKIS also proposed clarifying that during measurement of saleable area, features such as pipe duct, mouldings, architectural fins and air-conditioning platforms not be included (Chung, 2007; LEGCO, 2007). Alnwick Chan Chi-Hing, an executive director at Knight Frank, said: \u201cThe new practice has clarified the definition of saleable area.

But if the housing unit involves a clubhouse, shared space is found to exert a positive effect on housing prices. This indicates that home buyers are more willing to pay for a larger amount of shared space (and accept a higher GFA or accept a lower NFA), if a clubhouse exists within the development. Comparing the coefficients of Models I and II shows that, while the GFA has a higher positive price elasticity than the NFA, nonetheless it is also associated with a higher negative price elasticity of the shared space. This reflects that the amount of shared space of the housing units will exert a stronger negative influence on housing prices, when the GFA rather than the NFA is used as a price estimator.",

This assumes that it is easier to cheat home buyers for larger units than smaller units. The results indicate that coefficients of some independent variables are highly sensitive to these alternations. In Model III, the negative price elasticity of shared space expands further, whereas in Model IV, the positive price elasticity of internal space increases considerably.

Many factors have an influence on housing prices. Floor area of the housing unit is one of these factors. It is normally expected that the larger is the amount of floor area, the higher will be the housing price. In the high-density building environment of Hong Kong, the measurement of floor area of a housing unit is complicated by the inclusion of an unidentifiable amount of shared space. Therefore, housing buyer in Hong Kong faces with at least two different categories of housing space in a purchase decision: internal space that is exclusively enjoyed by the purchaser and shared space that is an undivided part to be used jointly with other residents within the same building or housing development. The situation is further perplexed because there has been no standardized and statutory measurement of these two categories of housing space.",

The price elasticity of NFA is higher than that of the GFA. The analysis also confirms that there is a negative relationship between the amount of shared space and housing prices. In other words, the higher is the amount of shared space, the lower will be the housing price, ceteris paribus.

However, when these facilities are added into the housing projects, they may have an effect of expanding the GFAs considerably rather than the net floor areas. As this study shows, the home buyers should be made aware of how much floor space of these facilities are distributed \u2018numerically\u2019 into each of the living units. They are also highly sensitive to this space distribution. It is therefore important for the government to further promote and enforce the accuracy, transparency and consistency in floor area information especially in relation to the measurement of NFA in property sales brochures provided by the developers.",
