Its effects can be seen in social disruption, exceptional healthcare utilization, and economic instability worldwide. Many healthcare systems have continued to serve patients with urgent medical needs. However, the definition of what is to be classified as urgent disease differs. The need for intensive care units for COVID-19 patients exerts a strong influence on bedside procedures or operative intervention for non-COVID-19 patients.",

Some publications give recommendations and guidelines for physicians to ensure safety for themselves, their clinical staff, and their patients when they come into contact with patients who are suffering or have suffered from COVID-19 [1]. However, little attention in these dark days is paid to non-COVID-19 patients and their access to healthcare. The impression is that the entire medical community and/or political leaders are focusing on COVID-19 patients and other life-threatening diseases do not seem as important. Bone and soft tissue tumours are neoplasms that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, urgent and ideal treatment in the form of an interdisciplinary approach should be provided for these musculoskeletal oncology patients [2]. Postponing, delaying, or stopping therapy can be followed by life-threatening consequences. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas cause significant morbidity and mortality [2], which lead to death if untreated.",

The results of our study show drastic impairment of musculoskeletal oncology services worldwide. Resection of bone and soft tissue sarcomas, which untreated lead to patient death [5], were reported by approximately 20% of the respondents to be discontinued in their department. Bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas can infiltrate the neurovascular bundle or cause a severe pathological fracture, which can compromise the oncologic resection. Consequently, limb salvage might no longer be possible and patients would have to be scheduled for ablative final operations [6, 7].",

Accordingly, the reallocation of intermediate and intensive care units to COVID-19 patients would be the only reason for the fundamental reduction of this vital therapy for sarcoma patients. Amputations were still reported by a high rate of participants (85.9%), giving rise to the assumption that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients, who might have been candidates for a limb salvage procedure, underwent an ablative procedure in order to save their life. In addition, a stop or delay in reconstruction after sarcoma resection was reported by 23.5% (autologous bone graft) to 25.9% (custom made endoprosthesis) of the participants (Fig. 1, Table 1). Another reason for this scenario might have been to reduce contamination (staff, patients, community) in an \u201copen environment\u201d such as hospitals, which are difficult to control, in order to prevent contamination of immunocompromised patients (cancer patients).",

Our study found that the pandemic is having an enormous impact on physicians\u2019 conduct toward their families at home. Only 1.3% of the participants reported not having made any changes in their home behaviour at all. However, 68.25% reported isolating themselves in various ways, namely 21.6% kept a distance from other family members, 25.7% avoided any physical contact with them, 6.8% reported living in separate rooms at home, and 4% were no longer going home until further notice, as they feared they could potentially harm their family (Table 2). Aware of the risk of healthcare professionals such as physicians contracting COVID-19, musculoskeletal physicians are understandably trying to protect the ones closest to them by practicing some form of self-imposed social distancing in their private life.",

Moreover, in most countries, the treatment of sarcomas and musculoskeletal tumors is centralized to highly specialized sarcoma centres staffed by ISOLS and EMSOS members, namely experts and opinion leaders in their specialization.
