            "text": "Coronaviruses, family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales, are generally responsible for mild enteric and respiratory infections in both humans and animals (Masters, 2006). They are now recognized as emerging viruses with a propensity to cross into new host species, as have been shown by previous and recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Coleman and Frieman, 2014). To date, coronaviruses were classified into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. The genus Gammacoronavirus is mostly composed of viruses isolated from birds. However, gammacoronaviruses have also been detected in the beluga whale (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008) and bottlenose dolphin (Woo et al., 2014). The most economically important of the avian gammacoronaviruses are infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronaviruses. IBV, which was the first identified coronavirus and was isolated in the 1930s, causes highly contagious infectious bronchitis in domestic fowl, a respiratory, renal, and genital disease, which causes serious economic consequences worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007).",

About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated as the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, and then processed by virus-encoded proteinases into 15 or 16 non-structural proteins (Ziebuhr, 2005). The remaining one-third of the genome encodes the virus structural spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as four non-structural accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 5a and 5b). The S glycoprotein can be cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, and contains the regions of both B- and T-cell epitopes that are important for virus neutralization and the reorganization of virus-infected cells (Reguera et al., 2012, Satoh et al., 2011). The S1 domain occupies the amino proximal half, which contains the receptor-binding domain, and the S2 domain occupies the other half, which contains elements involved in membrane fusion.",

            "text": "In contrast to species belonging to the alpha- and betacoronaviruses, which occur as only one or two different serotypes, there are many different serotypes/genotypes of the chicken coronavirus IBV (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014). Typing of IBV strains is based on the feature of the S protein, especially S1 domain (Cavanagh, 2007). The high mutation and recombination rate of IBV, especially in the S1 subunit of the S protein gene, has led to the emergence of new variants, particularly in Europe and North America, and more recently in intensive poultry farms in China. Among the IBVs, two very important genotypes, LX4 (QX-like) and ck/CH/LDL/97I, are believed to have originated in China in mid-1995 and have since spread to other regions of the world (Ababneh et al., 2012, Marandino et al., 2015). More recently, another novel genotype, Guandong/Xindadi (XDN), which is also believed to have originated in China from independent recombination events between the LX4 and 793/B IBV genotypes, have emerged in Italy and Spain (Moreno et al., 2016). The continuous emergence of new IBV genotypes in China that later spread to other regions of the world has not only prompted the development of appropriate control programs aimed to mitigate the occurrence of the disease caused by those new IBV genotypes, but also emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance of IBV in chicken flocks in China. Meanwhile, extensive investigations, involving molecular characterization (especially the complete genome), antigenicity, and pathogenicity, are necessary to clarify the origin of the viruses and are significant for the control of diseases caused by new variants. In this study, a novel serotype (designated as GI-28) of IBV was found to be mainly circulated in south China in recent years and the complete genome, antigenicity, and pathogenicity were investigated to elucidate the origin and evolution of the novel serotype.",

The bird showed obvious respiratory signs at 70 days old. In this flock, morbidity was about 15% and mortality was 3%. Gross lesions were mainly mild with tracheitis, proventriculitis, and nephritis in some chickens. The proventriculi of the dead chickens were enlarged and had pale or mottled pale serosa. Kidneys of the birds were enlarged and pale. Virus isolation was performed as described by Liu and Kong (2004). Briefly, the proventriculi were homogenized, clarified by centrifugation, filtered, and then inoculated into specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Harbin, China) on embryonation day 9 via the allantoic cavity. The isolate were purified and propagated by inoculating and passaging three times in the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs until characteristic IBV lesions, such as dwarfing, stunting, or curling of embryos, were observed (Liu and Kong, 2004, Hewson et al., 2009).",

Five chickens in each group were humanly killed using carbon dioxide/oxygen. The dead chickens were carefully examined, especially for lesions in the trachea, kidneys, and proventriculi. Then, tissues of the tracheal, lungs, kidneys, and cecal tonsils were collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at a thickness of 4 \u03bcm, and mounted on glass slides, which were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed to detect the IBV antigen using monoclonal antibody 6D10 against the N protein as described by Han et al. (2016) and Gao et al. (2016).

The percentage of seropositive birds for each group in this study was calculated. All surviving birds were killed humanely using carbon dioxide/oxygen at 3 months of age, which was followed by exsanguination.

Analysis of complete genomic sequence of the ck/CH/LGX/111119 revealed that the virus exhibited high identity in the entire genome with LX4 genotype IBVs with the exception of the S1 protein gene, which is markedly diverse. We proposed that the emergence of GI-28 genotype viruses in chicken flocks in China resulted from recombination events involving LX4 genotype IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified IBV donating a S1 gene that encoded a protein of low amino acid identity to those of other IBVs (approximately 87.3%). This was very similar to that of turkey coronavirus, which was thought to have arose through recombination of the S gene (Jackwood et al., 2010). Alternatively, the GI-28 serotype might have originated from the accumulation of mutations and selection, especially in the S1 gene, because S1 domain showed the high sequence diversity in IBV (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014). If this is the case, strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 might have undergone extensive divergent evolution and acquired the abilities to infect and spread among chicken flocks. The higher sequence similarity in other regions in the genome outside of the S1 gene suggest a common origin of these sequences and could explain the closer antigenicity between ck/CH/LGX/111119 and ck/CH/LDL/091022, as compared with those of other serotypes, because in addition to the five conformation-dependent neutralizing antigenic sites mapped on S1, another immunodominant region was mapped in the N-terminal region of S2 (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014) and some antigenic epitopes that have roles in the protection have also been identified on N proteins of IBV (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005).",

This is in contrast to the observation in the field cases, where obvious respiratory signs and proventriculitis were observed. There are at least two possible reasons for this discrepancy: First, IBV strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 may not be the only causative pathogen responsible for the occurrence of the outbreak, and secondary infections caused by other microorganisms enhance the severity and contribute to the disease development. Second, it is also possible that different genetics of the chicks in the field cases and of the chicks experimentally infected are responsible for the difference in tropism of the virus; it is believed that genetics of chickens play an important role in differences in IBV susceptibility and tropism (Ignjatovic et al., 2003). It is believed that IBV mainly infects the respiratory and urogenital tracts, but it has long been known that IBV can be isolated from digestive organs, such as the proventriculus, intestines, and cloaca, and persists in the cecal tonsils (Ambali and Jones, 1990, Ambali, 1992, Montgomery et al., 1997). Similarly, the results of this study showed that obvious positive immunohistochemical reactions developed not only in the cytoplasm of the tubular epithelial cells and in the mucous membrane of the ureters and collecting ducts in the kidney, and in the epithelial cells of the tracheal mucosa of the secondary bronchi at 5 dpc, but the viral antigens were also detected in the cecal tonsils. This result suggests a broad tissue tropism of strain ck/CH/LGX/111119, similar as that of its deduced parental LX4 genotype viruses (Benyeda et al., 2009, de Wit et al., 2011, Mork et al., 2014).",
