EVD, formally known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. While the fatality rate varies from 25 to 90%, the average rate sits at around 50%. It is thought that the virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. Ebola first appeared in 1976 in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The original outbreak was in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease was named. Since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks of the disease throughout Africa.1",

By January 14, 2016, when the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the epidemic to be over, the crisis had lasted nearly two years, during which time more than 28,600 people were infected with the virus and more than 11,300 lives were lost, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (WHO 2016b; CBS\n2016). Faced with such a devastating humanitarian crisis, the entire international community has shown great courage in fighting the disease.

Through four rounds of emergency aid supplied in April, August, September and October 2014, a total of 750 million yuan (about USD 123 million) was contributed to West African countries by China. In addition to financial and material assistance, China also sent more than 1,000 medical personnel to the region to help with local epidemic prevention and control work (NHFPC 2015a; UNDP 2014a). This was unprecedented in the history of Chinese foreign assistance.

This chapter aims to answer these questions through the lens of human security rather than from a general foreign policy perspective. For this purpose, it begins by laying out the criteria and framework for the analysis. This is followed by an examination of China\u2019s efforts to fight the crisis. The chapter then goes on to evaluate these policies with a focus on effectiveness, empowerment and motives. Based on China\u2019s experiences in Africa, the concluding section draws some lessons for future human security-oriented foreign policies.",

            "text": "When the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2177 on September 18, 2014, declaring the outbreak of Ebola in Africa to be \u2018a threat to international peace and security,\u2019 the Ebola crisis was no longer a mere health issue but an international security crisis (UNSC 2014). Of course, it was not the first time that the Security Council had acknowledged the link between health and security. In 2000, the Council had recognized the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Resolution 1308 (UNSC 2000, 1), and declared it to be \u2018a risk to security and stability,\u2019 although its main concern was on the \u2018regional effects\u2019 in Africa (Deloffre 2014a). Resolution 1308 is important in terms of human security because the Council clearly focused not only on issues such as preventing wars and control of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction but also dealt with matters concerning human security such as disease (Poku 2013, 529). Therefore, Resolution 1308 constitutes a clear securitization of public health issues within the UN system. Following the Ebola crisis, Resolution 2177 and the creation of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in 2014 pushed the scale and depth of securitization to an unprecedented level, while at the same time brought the securitization processes into close alignment with human security frameworks (Snyder 2014). The question to be asked in this context is, therefore: what is meant by human security, and what counts as appropriate foreign and aid policies toward human security threats?",

            "text": "Since its introduction in 1994 (UNDP 1994), the concept of human security has increasingly been reflected in global governance and in the foreign and aid policies of many countries. Yet the kind of definition one adopts, narrow or broad, will have very different operational and policy implications. In keeping with the approach to human security taken by JICA and many East Asian countries (see Chapter 10.1007/978-3-319-95240-6_2 in this book; Tanaka 2015; JICA 2010), this chapter takes a broader concept as its working definition and uses this to identify the three features of human security. First, the causes and effects of human security can be far-reaching and multifaceted, and if we underestimate the complexity of such threats, we can never have adequate policies toward human security practices. Secondly, human security and human development are so closely related that, even though we can conceptually separate them, we must be aware of the interconnectedness between the two at the operational level (Cui 2014). Amartya Sen made the point comprehensively. He argued that on the one hand, human security demands both \u2018 protection\u2019 of people from a variety of dangers, and \u2018empowerment\u2019 of people so that they can cope with, and when possible overcome, these hazards. On the other hand, human development is concerned with \u2018removing the various hindrances that restrain and restrict human lives and prevent its blossoming,\u2019 and hence goes beyond \u2018overarching concentration on the growth of inanimate objects of convenience\u2019 (CHS 2003, 8\u20139). Such a comprehensive understanding is at the heart of his conceptualization of \u2018development as freedom,\u2019 in which poverty, one of the central concerns of human security, is no longer premised solely on income, but seen as a non-fulfillment of basic human rights (Sen 1999). Thirdly, when human security is threatened by conflict situations, natural disasters or pandemics, it is often the case that the most vulnerable people in society are the ones who are most threatened.",

            "text": "Given these features of human security, what kinds of policy tools are to be considered as most appropriate and effective? Tanaka (2015, 15\u201320) distinguishes between two types of human security instruments: \u2018fundamental measures\u2019 that affect the underlying causes of human security, and \u2018defensive measures\u2019 that affect consequences. This is very similar to Johan Galtung\u2019s (1969) distinction between \u2018 positive peace\u2019 and \u2018 negative peace,\u2019 because fundamental measures may bring positive peace, while defensive measures are more likely to bring negative peace. For Galtung, peace can be defined in a negative way, meaning the absence of violence (both direct and structural). Yet more importantly, peace can also be defined positively, that is, the construction of an appropriate environment for lasting peace. In other words, the conditions for positive peace may be built through a process analogous to the \u2018building of a healthy body capable of resisting diseases, relying on its own health forces or health sources\u2019 (Galtung 1985, 145\u201346). Drawing on these ideas, this chapter is framed around three measures by which human security policies can be assessed.",

The issue here is how swiftly and decisively can a country reduce the negative impacts of disease and human suffering. This is in line with Tanaka\u2019s defensive measure or Galtung\u2019s negative peace. Effectiveness means more than speed, scale and comprehensiveness; it also refers to the ability to cooperate with a variety of actors to tackle human security threats. Speed and scale are extremely important; however, if they are pursued singlehandedly, their impact remains limited. Cooperation is imperative when trying to effectively handle deadlier challenges. The Ebola crisis is a good demonstration of how a problem goes beyond the capacity of a single state. UNMEER was created specially to coordinate a variety of actors to fight the crisis more effectively. Thus, both comprehensiveness and cooperation are required if human security policies are to be effective.",

Taking individual health as an example, although a person may be cured of a disease, if they do not build up their bodily conditions, illness will reoccur. Empowerment is more closely related to dealing with structural violence as the underlying cause, building capacities, and creating a more secure environment, so that the occurrence of human security threats can be prevented or the likelihood of them occurring be reduced (Cui 2012). In this way, even if threats occur, people have the ability, or at least an increase in the ability, to address those threats on their own. Thus, if the first evaluate of effectiveness is used to assess more short-term defensive approaches, empowerment is used to evaluate longer-term fundamental approaches to human security.",

Traditionally, theorists, particularly realists, emphasized national interests when measuring national foreign policies. Hans Morgenthau (2005, 1950, 854) argued explicitly that a \u2018foreign policy derived from the national interest is in fact morally superior to a foreign policy inspired by universal moral principles.\u2019 Of course, Morgenthau did not deny political morality and prudence, or the need for a logic of consequences to save policy makers from both moral excess and political folly. However, because most human security-related governance activities do not directly relate to national interests in the narrow realist sense, the notion of raison d\u2019\u00e9tat provides poor guidance and does not fully explain the current global efforts to achieve human security. Thus, the practice of human security requires a certain degree of consideration of those people who are socially vulnerable, and concern should be given to the possibility of their dignity being exposed to existential threats.",

            "text": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa broke out in December 2013 and the WHO put out its first alert in March 2014. What followed was the largest, longest, and most severe and complex outbreak of the virus since it was discovered in 1976 (WHO 2016a). Although at the initial stage the impact of the outbreak was underestimated, following the declaration of emergency and threat by the WHO and the UNSC in August and September 2014, the international community has made great efforts and shown solidarity in the fight against the deadly disease. Among the countries fighting EVD, traditional donors, such as the USA and the UK, played a leading role. By October 2014, the US government was ranked as the largest donor having contributed around USD 750 million in aid, with the UK coming in second with about USD 330 million (WHO 2014a). Yet, the crisis also saw intense media attention given to some non-traditional donors, like China. By October 2014, China had contributed close to USD 123 million in financial aid. Although this was much lower than that of the USA, it was still above the contribution of traditional donor countries such as France, Japan and Canada (UNDP 2014a; see also Fig. 8.1).2 Accordingly, China\u2019s role and its impact on human security merit more detailed examination.\n",

            "text": "China\u2019s participation in fighting the Ebola epidemic is regarded as being historic, marking the first time it offered such aid to help combat a foreign health crisis (Tiezzi 2015). The Chinese government also admits that it was the largest medical aid program to be implemented by China at the time (NHFPC 2015b). China\u2019s role in fighting Ebola was particularly important in the early stages and was in stark contrast to the delayed response of the rest of the international community. For instance, even though the WHO was first alerted to the outbreak on March 23, 2014, it was not until April that M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) first warned that Ebola was getting out of control. By June, the spread and scale of the epidemic was obvious to many experts, yet it was not until August 8 that the WHO declared that it was a public health emergency. As a result, the international response generated criticism as being both too small and too slow (Dearden 2014; Gr\u00e9pin 2015). In comparison, China\u2019s response was swift. There are two reasons for this swift response: first, given China\u2019s long-term medical cooperation with African countries, many doctors and medical staff were already present in African countries when the outbreak began. For example, when the epidemic first emerged in Guinea, a Chinese medical team of nineteen people from Beijing\u2019s Anzhen Hospital was working at the China\u2013 Guinea Friendship Hospital in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. During this time, one infected patient was treated in the hospital without anyone realizing it was Ebola and was thus faced with the risk of death. Secondly, the Chinese experience with SARS in 2003 and its struggle to stop its spread, coupled with an awareness of the weaknesses in the medical system in West Africa, made Chinese officials and medical experts particularly alert to pandemics in West Africa.3 In fact, the weak healthcare systems in all three countries were emphasized by many medical experts after Ebola broke out. As Marie-Paule Kieny (2014) notes, Ebola became epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in large part due to their weak healthcare systems. Indeed, all these countries lack adequate numbers of qualified health workers, particularly in rural areas. Other limitations included weak or absent rapid response systems, and a lack of electricity and running water in some health facilities (Kieny 2014; WHO 2014c).",

In August, the epidemic accelerated as the total number of cases reached almost 2,000, with more than 1,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone alone. Cases of infections among American, British and Spanish citizens were also reported. On August 8, 2014, the WHO declared that the epidemic had gone from being an African problem to an \u2018emergency of international concern\u2019 (WHO 2014b). This situation alerted the top Chinese leaders. On August 7, 2014, Beijing announced its second round of assistance, whereby it would provide emergency anti-epidemic supplies worth 30 million yuan (about USD 4.86 million) to the three most affected countries. The supplies were mainly medical protective clothing, sterilization equipment, drugs and other much-needed medical equipment and supplies. Due to the urgency of the situation, China even used chartered planes to deliver medical supplies, which arrived on August 13, just one week after the announcement. The initial aid was followed by another three Chinese medical teams dispatched across West Africa to help with prevention and treatment. By this stage, more than 170 medical workers had been dispatched (China Daily, September 26, 2014).",

Two days later, the UNSC declared the outbreak of Ebola to be a \u2018threat to international peace and security\u2019 (UNSC 2014). On September 19, the UNMEER, the first-ever UN emergency health mission, was formed. This mission was led by a full range of UN actors, who utilized their expertise under the leadership of a special representative of the secretary general. It was in such crisis atmosphere that many countries pledged more aid and manpower to help. On September 16, US President Barack Obama announced \u2018major increases\u2019 in the US response to fighting Ebola in Africa including up to 3000 troops, material to build field hospitals, additional healthcare workers, community care kits and badly needed medical supplies (New York Times, September 16, 2014). In a speech to the UN High-level Meeting on the response to the EVD outbreak on September 25, 2014, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also promised that Japan would provide 500,000 sets of protective gear for medical personnel working to combat Ebola in Africa. In October, Japan used civilian aircraft to deliver 20,000 sets of protective gear to Liberia and Sierra Leone (Asahi Shimbun, February 18, 2015). In September, as its third phase of assistance, China increased its contribution significantly by opening a biosafety lab and providing protective treatment supplies and food assistance. Additionally, to help Sierra Leone improve lab testing, China sent a laboratory team of 59 (thirty doctors and twenty-nine laboratory technicians) to work at the Sierra Leone\u2013 China Friendship Hospital (China Daily, September 17, 2014).",

Japan, for example, while making significant financial and material contributions lagged behind many other countries in terms of the provision of personnel. By the end of 2014, Japan had sent a total of twenty Japanese experts to participate in WHO missions to Liberia and Sierra Leone, two Self-Defense Force (SDF) personnel to the headquarters of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) in Germany to support liaison activities, and one to UNMEER as a senior advisor (Government of Japan 2015). There were suggestions from Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry that a Ground SDF unit would be dispatched to join the fight in Sierra Leone. The plan was submitted to the prime minister\u2019s office on February 18, 2015, and called for 400 GSDF personnel to begin operations in April, with a possible Maritime SDF contingent to serve as the base of operations. However, for many reasons Japan did not go ahead with the plan. This decision generated some criticism because although Prime Minister Abe promotes a vision of \u2018 proactive pacifism,\u2019 he chose to put Japanese lives and his government\u2019s own political interests ahead of global well-being (Pollmann 2015; The Japan Times, February 24, 2015). South Korea made a large step in its contribution to international personnel at this time. In addition to the USD 12.6 million of assistance it had already provided, between December 2014 and April 2015, Seoul sent three emergency relief teams (a total number of thirty people), comprising mostly skilled military and civilian healthcare workers, to West African countries to carry out medical activities (The Korea Times, October 17, 2014; China News, April 3, 2015). This represented the first time that the South Korean government had sent an emergency relief team to fight the outbreak of an epidemic overseas.",

Since mid-September 2014, the USA had shown renewed engagement and significantly enhanced the global scale of the fight against Ebola. Over the course of the epidemic, the USA deployed more than 3500 personnel to the affected region5; as a superpower and as a longstanding traditional donor country, the USA did play a leading role in this humanitarian effort. Nevertheless, as a rising great power and as a non-traditional donor country, China\u2019s growing role in international aid and global governance is commendable for its willingness and comprehensiveness.",

Even though at the government level China contributed over USD 120 million to fight Ebola, at the private sector level it donated little to the cause. Many firms and business people in China still assume that the Chinese government should take the lead on international assistance.6 In a deeper sense, this philanthropic shortfall is the result of China\u2019s international aid tradition, which has been predominantly bilateral and government-to-government. This is clearly revealed in China\u2013 Africa relations. Since China began its assistance to Africa in the 1950s, it has been the government that has initiated the sending of medical practitioners and the building of roads and railways (Chan 2011, 95\u2013122). Even at present, this tendency has not changed very much; hence, the aid commitment under the multilateral mechanism of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) is also realized mainly through a bilateral mechanism (Xu 2012). With global multilateral cooperation frameworks growing in sophistication, China faces the challenges of how to better integrate itself into the multilateral development framework.",

As argued earlier in this chapter, empowerment refers to a longer-term positive/fundamental approach to human security that looks at the underlying causes of human security threats and should ultimately lead to an improved capacity to overcome threats. Strictly speaking, capacity building and empowerment may not be entirely identical, as the former is more related to organizational capabilities, while the latter is more concerned with people. Yet, the two are closely related to each other, and building organizational capabilities such as proper health systems can directly and indirectly enhance individual health resilience in the long term. Thus, this chapter examines the following two aspects in detail: China\u2019s effort in offering help to build public healthcare systems and its active engagement in African economic and social reconstruction.",

If China\u2019s four major rounds of assistance between April and October 2014 were dedicated mainly to stopping the spread of the Ebola epidemic, since then China has focused more on long-term capacity building (Embassy of the PRC 2014). In November 2014, China sent its public health training team to Sierra Leone to study the ways they could carry out training for public health professionals in West Africa. The team was to smooth the way for large-scale training programs in the future. By August 2015, Chinese public health training teams had trained more than 10,000 residents, including medical staff, community healthcare workers, government officials and volunteers. Using China\u2019s fight against SARS as a way of sharing their experiences, the training teams were able to deliver useful prevention and control knowledge and skills to the participants (NHFPC 2015a; Embassy of PRC 2015). Indeed, empowerment through improving regional health systems has become an important part of the China-Africa health cooperation. At the second Ministerial Forum of China-Africa Health Development in early October 2015, ministers emphasized the importance of African people being able to access quality essential health commodities, medicines, vaccines and medical services (NHFPC 2015c). To that end, China pledged to send 1500 medical workers to Africa in the next three years, and it encouraged ten of its large pharmaceutical and medical equipment enterprises to cooperate with various African counterparts, through measures such as technology transfers in the production, maintenance and distribution of quality pharmaceutical products (China Daily, October 8, 2015).",

Additionally, at the 2015 Forum, China pledged USD 60 billion worth of assistance and loans for African development. It also specified ten areas of cooperation and assistance, including agriculture modernization, public health and poverty reduction that it would engage in.7 In the declaration, China promised it would transfer agricultural technology to Africa; cancel outstanding debt for some of the poorest African countries; help build an African center for disease control; and back cooperation between twenty Chinese and African hospitals.

Of course, this does not mean that China has abandoned the principles of non-conditionality, non-interference, and respect for sovereignty, which continue to underpin the basic principles of China\u2019s foreign and aid policies. However, the growing emphasis on poverty reduction (\u51cf\u5c11\u8d2b\u56f0) and improvement of people\u2019s livelihood (\u6539\u5584\u6c11\u751f) means that these are increasingly attuned to those values of human security which have been endorsed and promoted by the UN and the international community (State Council of China 2014; UNDP 2014b). The shift also reflects some important changes in the way China assesses global security threats and identifies its national interests; this is increasingly in line with the broader definition of human security. As China\u2019s foreign aid specialist Wang Xiaolin argues, the trend of China\u2019s foreign assistance has changed significantly from being driven by ideology and only aiding socialist countries to being based on its assessment of global security challenges. China sees the global security agenda, such as poverty reduction and tackling climate change, as being part of its foreign aid agenda, and hence its foreign assistance is more consistent with the Millennium Development Goals (now the Sustainable Development Goals) (Wang 2014).",

            "text": "Importantly, as the global security agenda expands, human security norms such as poverty reduction and environmental responsibility have emerged and been institutionalized as important norms and institutions in international society (Kozyrev 2016; Kopra 2017). The global adoption of MDGs (2001) and SDGs (2016) has hugely contributed to the institutionalization of a human security norm in international society. Building on the success of the MDGs, the SDGs with 17 goals and 169 targets are particularly determined to eradicate poverty and hunger in all their forms, which are the core elements of human security. Moreover, the SDGs are also truly global in nature and universally applicable, and all countries have a shared responsibility to achieve them (UNGA 2015). In this way, human security norms have become an important and legitimate basis for moral claims within international society and even have an impact on \u2018the criteria for rightful membership\u2019 of international society (Falkner and Buzan 2017, 31). Given that China is so eager to build its global image as a responsible \u2018great power,\u2019 it cannot ignore these changes. Thus, the argument can be made that China may not entirely abandon its national interests and would not promote its foreign aid purely out of altruistic aspirations; however, it does indicate the ways in which China assumes and identifies its national interests in the changing international environment of the twenty-first century. In other words, China is increasingly seeing its national interests and security in terms of the interests and security of international society as a whole; in so doing, China is showing a growing sense of raison de syst\u00e8me in global international society, in which human security considerations are becoming an important part of its foreign policy projection.",

The \u2018Eight Principles\u2019 were announced by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1963 during a visit to Africa. The principles \u2018established the notion of non-conditionality of Chinese foreign aid\u2019 (UNDP 2014b, xi; Chaponni\u00e8re 2009, 57\u201358).The militarization of aid in a variety of global contexts has long been a concern for humanitarian actors, who worry that such actions violate important principles of ethical humanitarian aid, namely: \u2018neutrality\u2019 (not taking sides in a conflict); \u2018impartiality\u2019 (not discriminating in aid provision); and \u2018independence\u2019 (working free from government interference). Accordingly, several NGOs have renounced working with military forces in the provision of humanitarian relief (Deloffre 2014b; Dionne et al. 2014).\n",
