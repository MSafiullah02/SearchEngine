The novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rapidly transmitted to all provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) of China and dozens of other countries, and has raised widespread national and international concerns. Although the authorities have taken proactive measures to combat COVID-19, the case count from the SARS-CoV-2 soared continually. Until 22 February 2020, there were 78,811 confirmed cases globally with 2462 (3.1%) deaths in 29 countries [2].",

According to the guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 (6th trial edition) from China National Health Commission [3], respiratory droplets and close contact are the main routes of transmission. Meanwhile, prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosol in a relatively closed environment is a risk of aerosol transmission [3]. The literature showed that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and blood and have the potential to spread such infections to dental personnel and other people in the dental office [4]. Consequently, according to the Chinese authorities\u2019 recommendations and with fears of COVID-19, people are reluctant to go outside but stay in house. Our previous investigation showed that patients were less willing to go to dental institutions, and the proportion of dental and oral infection in emergency dental care rose at the beginning of the epidemic [5].",

Nine-tenths of them notified the change of dental services via a web-based and/or mobile-based network, while the others provided on-site or passive telephone notification only. As the usual face-to-face non-emergency dental services were canceled, 69% of the hospitals offered free online professional consultations for determining whether a condition was necessary for emergency treatment, and providing home dental and oral care guidance. The vast majority of those services were easily accessible through a widely used social software called WeChat. About two-fifths of the telehealth was 24 h of continuous service, while the others were time-limited.",

There would be a potential risk for transmission of acute viral respiratory tract infections during dental procedures because of aerosol production [6]. Thus, according to the guidelines of the Chinese Stomatological Association (CSA) [7], suspending general non-emergency dental treatment has potential importance in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, it may have a negative impact on patients\u2019 dental health or treatment effects, such as the prolonged orthodontic treatment time. Patients\u2019 psychological status (e.g., fear of infection) would also affect the progression of oral mucosa diseases [8]. There have been online questionnaires supplied by some public tertiary dental hospitals to identify whether their dental patients were anxious or worried about the delayed dental visit. Although the public dental hospitals still offered emergency treatments for patients, significant utilization reduction in emergency dental services was observed at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic [5]. Some dental specialists were also concerned about exploding visits after the end of the epidemic. The strengths of administrative departments of the government are suggested to be coordinated to implement comprehensive prevention and control measures in future dental care. However, there should be further studies about the long-term socioeconomic, psychological, or physical impacts of the current provision of dental services during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

The penetration rate was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of central/western regions (87.0% vs. 52.0%), which might be related to the economic development and oral health status. The online consultation, being a subset of teledentistry, provides education and preventive care to dental patients and has the potential to identify high-risk populations [9]. It is an innovative method of oral health service delivery that can connect dental practitioners and patients. This is important particularly for underserved oral care due to the COVID-19 epidemic or other reasons like geographical barriers or dental workforce shortages. The efficacy and benefits of online dental consultation have supported it integrating into routine dental health service [10], and the wide application during the epidemic would help its extensive promotion. The development of consultation software or apps was desired not only by patients but also by medical specialists, for better data consolidation, to access patients\u2019 previous medical records and facilitate their referrals to dental hospitals or clinics. The encouragement of online dental consultation should be enhanced especially for rural and remote areas in central and western regions to improve their locally based medical care.",
