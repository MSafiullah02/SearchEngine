Many studies in CLT have focused on the interface between the cognitive requirements of a learning task and the learners\u2019 resources such as task expertise. The cognitive load construct occupies an important place in the theory explaining the relationship between an instructional design and the learning outcomes. The theory distinguishes three types of cognitive load imposed by a learning task (Sweller et al., 1998): (a) intrinsic cognitive load (related to the number of information elements and the level of element interactivity inherent in the task), (b) extraneous cognitive load (the load created by the instructional design that does not contribute to learning), and (c) germane cognitive load (the load spent directly on learning). To be most effective, an instructional design has to reduce extraneous cognitive load and promote germane cognitive load (see Paas et al., 2003, Sweller et al., 1998).",

            "text": "From research into hypertext environments, many authors claim that hypertexts may cause high cognitive load or disorientation (e.g. Conklin, 1987, Foltz, 1996, McDonald and Stevenson, 1998b, Mohageg, 1992, Niederhauser et al., 2000, Wright, 1991). Navigating across non-linear environments is an activity which can interfere with the learning task because it requires additional resources in working memory (WM). According to DeStefano and LeFevre (2005), reading hypertexts would require important processing in WM like making decisions on the next information to process. Additionally, hypertext users have to plan their reading paths and construct a representation of the hypertext structure to navigate across the information space. In fact, processing non-linear information requires more relational processing than item specific processing (Wenger & Payne, 1996). Thus to understand the information conveyed by a hypertext, learners have to establish semantic relations between the nodes and to construct a representation of the semantic hypertext structure. A high number of embedded links and a large semantic distance between information nodes would provoke high cognitive load (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2005). Consequently, in many circumstances, navigating or reading is highly demanding for a learner, causing high extraneous cognitive load as it not directly concerned with learning, and hampering the learning processes. Thus, to increase the effectiveness of hypertext, navigation should be less demanding.",

A structuring of the hypertexts\u2019 space organisation according to semantic concepts, like conceptual maps or overviews, has received much scientific interest (e.g. M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and M\u00f6ller, 2003, Potelle and Rouet, 2003, Scott and Schwartz, 2007). A helpful semantic organisation is usually based on conceptual categories (topics) with no or few cross-links between categories (e.g., hierarchy). A hierarchical structure is mainly made up of organizational links that organize the information, whereas a network structure is made up of relational links that stress relevant information, for example definition, generalization, similar information, etc., (Mohageg, 1992). Hence, giving information on the semantic organisation of hypertext content (i.e. organizational links) should limit the cognitive requirements (i.e. extraneous cognitive load) imposed by structural and conceptual disorientation, and allow more cognitive resources to be spent on effective processes for learning (i.e. germane cognitive load). However, the guidance effects provided by hierarchical structures may be moderated by the learners\u2019 prior domain knowledge. Although as reported below, the research is not always consistent.",

A hierarchical structure favors the building of a well organised representation of the hypertext macrostructure, and thus, helps develop a good representation of the topics, the concepts and their relationships (de Jong and van der Hulst, 2002, Dee-Lucas and Larkin, 1999, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and M\u00f6ller, 2003, Potelle and Rouet, 2003, Puntambekar et al., 2003). A hierarchical structure may guide the reading sequence (Calisir and Gurel, 2003, de Jong and van der Hulst, 2002), support coherent reading paths (Dee-Lucas & Larkin, 1995), limit perceived disorientation (Beasley and Waugh, 1995, Last et al., 2001) and improve navigation efficacy (Park & Kim, 2000). However, some studies have not found any effect of this type of structure, and authors suggest that hierarchical structures would be more helpful if the hypertext was larger containing more text sections because it would be more demanding (Brinkerhoff et al., 2001, Jonassen, 1993).",

This can be either because high prior knowledge learners have more cognitive resources available (due to reduced intrinsic load) so that they can handle the disorientation better, or that by actively exploring germane load is facilitated by the need to structurally/conceptually link information (prior knowledge enables this process to occur). This relation between prior knowledge and guidance is consistent with the research into the expertise reversal effect, which has found that for experts, guidance, which is highly effective for novices, may no longer contribute to learning, or may even hamper learning (Kalyuga et al., 2003, van Gog et al., 2008).",

It was predicted that learners would follow coherent reading sequences based on the organizational links (i.e. systematic exploration of the hierarchy) and thus maintain coherence between information nodes. Therefore, it was expected that a hierarchical structure would produce lower mental effort and less disorientation (i.e. extraneous cognitive load) than a network structure.

A network structure would lead high prior knowledge learners to engage in active explorations of the document based on their schemata to plan and construct their reading sequences. In comparison to the hierarchical structure, one of two possible outcomes was expected. Either there would be no difference because prior knowledge would reduce extraneous cognitive load (i.e. disorientation) significantly to enable learning to occur, but not necessarily promote additional germane cognitive load (Hypothesis 2a), or the network structure would lead to a better learning performance because the cognitive requirements of the network structure would promote inferential activity (germane load) based on prior knowledge and would help build a deep mental model of the content (Hypothesis 2b). In both cases it was predicted that for disorientation there would be no difference between structures. However, in terms of cognitive load, it was expected that for Hypothesis 2a there would be no difference, but for Hypothesis 2b cognitive load would increase in the network structure due to increased germane load.",

The coronavirus was chosen because it was not familiar to the participants and would allow new knowledge acquisition. The content was made up of different concepts (elements, events/actions). Seventeen text sections (pages) were used (total number of words = 681). Two conceptual maps were designed that reflected the structure of the document: one hierarchical and the other a network structure (see Fig. 1\n). The hierarchical structure gave a short presentation of the coronavirus at level 1, the macro-information at level 2 (the virus and the main stages), the sub-elements and sub-stages at levels 3 and 4. The macro-information was made up of four groupings: (a) description of the virus, (b) entrance of the virus into the cell, (c) production of virus\u2019 elements and (d) departure of the new viruses from the cell. The network structure presented the concepts without any groupings, but the concepts were connected by relational links reflecting semantic relations, like causal, temporal or spatial relations (rather than organizational links as in the hierarchical structure). In both structure conditions, clicking on a link of the conceptual map opened a text section and then a link below the text led back to the map where a new concept (or the same concept) could be opened. It should be noted that the material is called a non-linear document rather than a hypertext because it was not as extended and complex as a classical hypertext (e.g., there were no hyperlinks in the texts, one always had to return to the map). Thus the material was more controlled than an extended hypertext. However, the document is characterised by the non-linearity of information as in a hypertext, and thus would required similar processing.",

As expected, the HPK group tended to construct more coherent reading sequences than the LPK group in the network structure, F(1, 50) = 3.63, MSE\n = 0.87, p\n = .062, Cohen\u2019s d\n = 0.54. In the hierarchical structure, there was no effect of prior knowledge, F(1, 50) < 1, ns.",

It was hypothesized (Hypothesis 1) for low prior knowledge learners that a network structure (relational links between nodes) would result in high disorientation (i.e. extraneous cognitive load) and hamper construction of semantics relations between information nodes. For high prior knowledge learners, it was predicted that they would cope much better with the requirements of a network structure. Prior knowledge would constitute a resource to construct coherent reading sequences and to reduce disorientation. In addition, compared to a hierarchical structure it was hypothesized that a network structure would not support better outcomes (Hypothesis 2a) or conversely would support better outcomes because it would promote additional germane cognitive load (Hypothesis 2b).",

This beneficial effect for low prior knowledge learners replicates previous findings (Calisir and Gurel, 2003, de Jong and van der Hulst, 2002, Potelle and Rouet, 2003, Shapiro, 1999). In accordance with previous studies, the hierarchical structure supported coherent reading sequences (de Jong & van der Hulst, 2002) and limited perceived disorientation (Beasley & Waugh, 1995). These results tend to show that a hierarchal conceptual map would help low prior knowledge learners to avoid ineffective processing for learning. Such a structure assists learners in making decisions in navigation and maintaining coherence during reading. These findings are consistent with the cognitive load theory and confirm that disorientation may explain the effect of the type of structure for low prior knowledge learners. Nevertheless contrary to our expectations, the type of structure affected neither mental effort nor conceptual learning. In the former case, equivalent mental effort ratings between the experimental groups may be explained by free resources in working memory being allocated to learning from the text (germane load) rather than to navigation (extraneous cognitive load). Indeed similar levels of cognitive load may be devoted to entirely different processes (see Paas & Van Gog, 2006), although this argument must be treated with some caution as only the free recall data supports this possibility. The lack of significant effect on the conceptual knowledge may be due to high values of standard errors. Furthermore the lack of these expected effects may be due to the fact that the non-linear document used in the present study was less extended than classical hypertexts, thus it required less relational processing between nodes (Brinkerhoff et al., 2001). Indeed the disorientation ratings were quite low (M\n = 3.89). These low ratings suggest that, although disorientation depends on the type of structure, it does not interfere so much with the effective processing for learning. The study should be replicated with more extended non-linear documents requiring more relational processing.",

Secondly, the investigations of the learners\u2019 reading sequences provided some evidence for the existence of active explorations based on prior domain knowledge, as high prior knowledge learners followed more coherent reading sequences than lower prior knowledge learners in the network condition, suggesting they were able to produce inferences based on their knowledge structures to find relations between nodes and construct reading paths semantically coherent.

Under the present conditions, a mental effort measure was not sensitive enough to differentiate between the different effects, whereas measures of disorientation identified differences according to the type of structure. Contrary to the study conducted by Calisir and Gurel (2003) and in agreement with others studies (McDonald and Stevenson, 1998b, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and M\u00f6ller, 2003), the disorientation measures highlighted the difficulties caused by a network structure in comparison to a hierarchical structure. In constructing a pathway and a mental representation of the information space, a network structure imposes high processing demands. While previous works considered only global cognitive load (e.g. Zumbach & Mohraz, 2008) or disorientation (e.g. Otter & Johnson, 2000), the present study underlines the need to take into account both mental effort and disorientation in research on learning from hypertexts.",

Although the learners\u2019 prior knowledge supported coherent reading sequences in the network structure, the assessed disorientation was not reduced with greater prior knowledge. An explanation may be that disorientation is dependent on different levels of processing. Only one level of processing was investigated in this study (i.e. processing of reading sequences) whereas other levels of processing of non-linear documents may be highly demanding. For example, disorientation may also reflect difficulties caused by processing of structural information. Future investigations should examine the processes linked to cognitive load and disorientation, and distinguishing the processes supporting the construction of a global representation of the information organisation from the processes supporting the construction of relations between two nodes. New assessment methods such as eye tracking could provide more information on the attentional processes in the reading task or selection task (van Gog, Kester, Nievelstein, Giesbers, & Paas, 2009). In addition, combining navigation data with verbal protocols (van Gog, Paas, Van Merri\u00ebnboer, & Witte, 2005) should help to identify the type of reading strategies and processes as well as their relations with cognitive load and disorientation.",
