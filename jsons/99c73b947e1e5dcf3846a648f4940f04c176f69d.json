The dynamics of the global interdependence of nations and peoples have led to the emergence of global challenges, such as global warming, transnational spread of infectious diseases, pollution and climate change, illicit drug trade and obesity. These new challenges defy the classic Westphalian inter-state system i by disrespecting the geo-political boundaries of nation-states. As a result of the globalization of the world's political economy, policies at the \"domestic-foreign frontier\" (Rosenau, 1997) now converge and intermesh in a seamless web of global governance. The idea of global governance was popularized in the 1990s through the work of the Commission on Global Governance (1995) , and the emerging discourse in international relations (Rosenau Czempiel, 1992) . Governance is defined as: \" . . . the sum of the many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairs. It is a continuing process through which conflicting or diverse interests may be accommodated and co-operative action may be taken. It includes formal institutions and regimes empowered to enforce compliance, as well as informal arrangements that people and institutions either have agreed to or perceive to be of interest\" (Commission on Global Governance, 1995).",

Instead, global governance postulates the emergence of multiple actors -states, regional and international organizations, charitable foundations, non-governmental organizations, civil society, and private sector interests like multinational corporations and international business associations -that now share power, influence, and authority in the cross-national dealings (Aginam, 2005; Bettcher & Lee, 2002; Mathews, 1997) . Because of the absence of a centralized enforcing authority at the global level, global governance is not synonymous with government (Rosenau, 1997) .

The regulatory approaches to transnational spread of disease and other health threats pose enormous challenges that are beyond the governance capabilities of individual nation-states. Erosion of the traditional distinction between national and international health threats means states are no longer the sole actors or stakeholders in negotiating effective solutions to transnational health threats. The traditional use of treaties, regulations and formal regimes, mostly by states within international organizations like WHO, still plays an important role in global governance because countries have always used international law to solve problems that are transnational in nature (Aginam, 2005; Fidler, 1999; Kaul et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2003) . However, the globalization of public health has catalyzed emerging global health governance involving states, international organizations and nonstate actors (Kickbusch, 2003) . Gomez-Dantes (2001) observes, \"the actors who traditionally dominated the global health arena -national governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), and various NGOs -have been joined by development banks, aid agencies, and other private sector groups who wish to shape the response to the threat of disease.\"",

Practically, WHO must respond to the realities of the present international system, in which nation-states are still the dominant, but no longer the sole actors in international relations. As codified in the new IHR, WHO's global public health surveillance must transform from traditional state-centered approaches to a \"post-Westphalian\" global health governance (Fidler, 2004 ) -a combination of formal and informal governance tools that directly involves states as well as international organizations, civil society, and non-governmental organizations.",

Besides SARS, the IHR's application to \"all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern\" links WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to emerging epidemics and pandemics such as avian and pandemic influenza. The WHO has recently set up an advisory Task Force linked to the IHR on potential public health issues of international concern related to avian and pandemic influenza, including issues such as the appropriate phase of pandemic alert, the declaration of an influenza pandemic, and appropriate international response measures to a pandemic. The IHR are a key element in strengthening global health security and a platform for sharing knowledge and the ability to respond to rapidly-evolving emergencies globally. The IHR complement existing technical partnerships and networks of global disease surveillance (WHO, 2006) . The Regulations also offer a framework to enable WHO to collaborate more effectively with other non-state actors during health emergencies.",

Global PPPs for health are \"those collaborative relationships which transcend national boundaries and bring together at least three parties, among them a corporation (and/or industry association) and an intergovernmental organization, so as to achieve a shared health-creating goal on the basis of a mutually agreed and explicitly defined division of labour\" (Buse & Walt, 2002) .

Global health PPPs have been the subject of critical and analytical discourses that assess their fairness, legitimacy, accountability and transparency (Aginam, 2002; Buse & Walt, 2002; Yamey, 2002) . As Buse & Walt (2002) observed, the widespread adoption of PPPs in global health policy raises challenges, including the need for \"more empirical research on the institutional features that make such partnerships effective. Such empirical work should also aim to identify more generally applicable, good practice guidelines, including principles for 'good partnership governance ' (transparency, accountability, etc.) .\" In the absence of good practice guidelines, PPPs are accountable to no one. This has largely been the case with the Roll-Back Malaria Campaign and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (Aginam, 2002; Yamey, 2002) . The proliferation of PPPs, although valuable, should not be confused with optimal effectiveness for global health governance.",

The Global Fund was conceived mainly by the G8 summit as a PPP to promote an integrated approach emphasizing prevention in a continuum of treatment and care for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. These three diseases are poverty-related, with the heaviest burdens in developing regions of the world where the public health systems are weak and vulnerable populations cannot afford effective therapies.

Still, the Fund is not without serious problems.

The codification and implementation of global health accords is becoming increasingly important as global health interdependence accelerates and nations increasingly recognize the need to cooperate to solve essential problems. Governance of global health requires collaboration between international organizations with \"overlapping\" mandates, such as WHO, UNAIDS, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization and many others, along with both state and non-state actors.
