This shift is more marked in an expiratory film, due to shortening of the trachea. The transparency of the tracheal lumen normally decreases from cranial to caudal. The maximal width of the trachea is 25 mm (for men) and 21 mm (for women). The right tracheal border, where the trachea is in direct contact with lung tissue, can be traced from the clavicle to the right main bronchus. This border is referred to as the right paratracheal stripe or line and is visible in up to 60% of patients. Its width is normally less than 4 mm. A left paratracheal stripe is generally not visible, because the left tracheal border is in direct contact with the large vessels rather than lung tissue.",

On electrophoresis, different allele variants are detectable, F = fast, S = slow, Z = very slow, M = intermediate. Normal alleles are designated by MM and the most important homozygous defect is ZZ. The \u03b11-antitrypsin is the major plasma proteinase inhibitor, which inhibits the neutrophil Elastase, trypsin, plasmin, and thrombin. The glycoprotein is formed in the liver and transported via the blood. The presence of excess amounts of destructive Elastase leads to the development of pulmonary emphysema. The liver can be also affected by hepatic cirrhosis. Several mutations may occur, the most common two variants include:PiZ: amino acid substitution of glutamine by lysine at codon 342, most commonly seen in northern EuropePiS: substitution of glutamic acid by valine at codon 264, most commonly seen in southern Europe\n",

Furthermore, mycobacteria are transported to regional lymph nodes leading to lymphadenitis. Depending on the immune status, this may lead to septicaemia. Other manifestations are bronchial spread, sometimes with cavitation (Fig. 19.57). Bronchial tuberculosis spreads by continuity and affects the bronchial mucosa. This form of tuberculosis is also a form of open tuberculosis. Cavitation occurs with necrosis of the lung parenchyma, and contact with a bronchus. Thick-walled cavities may occasionally contain liquefied tissue material, which can be seen on radiography and CT as air-fluid levels.",

Normally, sodium is absorbed actively along a gradient through a highly selective ion channel. Intracellular sodium is transported to the extracellular fluid via the Na/K pump. Concomitantly, the transport of chloride ions occurs. Furthermore, chloride may be eliminated via selective channels. Because of the defective CFTR protein, chloride transport is hindered. There is intracellular accumulation of chloride ions. Consecutively, sodium and water are transported into the cell to maintain the electrochemical equilibrium.

It leads to bronchiolar narrowing due to peribronchial smooth muscle proliferation leading to the formation of emphysematous cysts. Intrapulmonary vessels are also affected, leading to development of pulmonary hypertension. Occasionally the thoracic duct is dilated. LAM can also affect extrapulmonary organs such as the uterus, kidneys, and pancreas. Associated angiomyolipomas of the kidneys are common. There are two different types of LAM, a rare sporadic variant, and another form in tuberous sclerosis patients.
