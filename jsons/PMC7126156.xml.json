In the small-world model, the regular lattices are responsible for large clustering, and a very small density of long-range connections has a drastic influence on short average distance [3], [4].",

For example, the progress in science and technology cannot hold back the spread of infectious biological viruses in human society; on the contrary, the current networking age makes the diseases easily propagate all around the world [6]. The current outbreak of H1N1 flu was first detected in Mexico City on March 18, 2009. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared an H1N1 pandemic on June 11, 2009, moving the alert level to phase 6, marking the first global pandemic since the 1968 Hong Kong flu. Up till now, the virus has already propagated in all regions of the world. In 2003, the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) leads to 8096 known infected cases and 774 deaths worldwide, declared by the WHO in the concluding report. The spread of computer viruses and worms on the Internet is another urgent problem. There were more than $30 billion in damage caused by the Sobig worm, and the entire Internet came to a halt in a very short period given without any countermeasures to control the worms [7]. The cascading financial crisis of the East Asia and the avalanching blackouts in the electric grid of North America are also the typical examples of failure propagation in the small-world networks [8], [9], [10]. In the view of wide occurrence of spreading behaviors in the small-world networks, it becomes a very interesting issue to investigate the spreading of viruses, diseases and even disasters in the network [11], [12], [13].",

Moukarzel proposed a novel linear model of disease spreading in d-dimensional small-world lattices, which produces an exponential growth of infection to the limit of network scale [14]. The investigations on the outbreak of SARS in 2003 have shown that the high clustering of small-world human social network is one of the keys to transmit SARS [15], [16], [17]. In fact, when the epidemic diseases propagate among humans or the computer viruses spread through the Internet, the administrative authorities usually take some counter measures to control the unfavorable prevalence. Prof. Li et al. have carried out some pioneering researches on the stability of the spreading dynamics in small-world network when control strategies are applied, and made great achievements. It was recently reported that there exist oscillating infective behaviors with some unsuitable recovery rates in the epidemiology [18], indicating the possible oscillations resulted from control strategies applied by the administrative authorities. However, Prof. Li et al. concluded that the oscillatory spreading phenomena in delay-controlled small-world network are topologically inherent after studying the stability of spreading models with linear and nonlinear feedback controllers [8]. Prof. Li et al. further investigated three linear delayed SIR models for different cases of recovery response, and found that the unsuitable recovery strength may lead to oscillations [6].",

The index to be optimized is normally the expectation of a function measuring the discrepancy between the predicted output and the desired output of the system over the prediction horizon plus a function measuring the control effort over the control horizon [21].

The future system outputs yp(t+i) for i=1,\u2026,Hp, are predicted over the prediction horizon Hp using a model of the system. These values depend on the current process state and the future control signals u(k+i) for i=0,\u2026,Hu\u22121, where Hu\u2a7dHp is the control horizon. The control variable is manipulated only within the control horizon and remains constant afterwards, i.e., u(k+i)=u(k+Hu\u22121) for i=Hu,\u2026,Hp. The sequence of future control signals u(k+i) for i=0,\u2026,Hu\u22121 is computed by optimizing a given objective function. The objective function defines the goal over the prediction horizon in combination with a cost function on the control effort over the control horizon.

The random rewiring in the small-world model means in the propagation process that, each time the infective node spreads through the forthcoming edge in the nearest-neighbor ring, it may be linked with another node through the rewired long-range connection with probability 0\u2a7dp\u2a7d1. Therefore, based on the mean-field approach, the total volume of infected individuals V(t) in the one-dimensional small-world evolving model satisfies(3)dV(t)dt=1\u2212p+pV(t\u2212\u03b4), where the time delay \u03b4>0 is due to the long-range spatial distance [23]. From Eq. (3) we can easily find that the infected volume V(t) grows exponentially and finally can cover the whole network if no counter measure is taken. Faced with the cascading spread of diseases or disasters, authorities usually implement the control strategies to struggle against the propagation, which, for example, result in the decrease of infected individuals by the increasing recovery of SARS patients, or the slaughter of infected animals [8]. Therefore, we translate the reactions taken by the authorities to the following spreading equation with a feedback controller:(4)dV(t)dt=1\u2212p+pV(t\u2212\u03b4)+u(t\u2212\u0394), where the controller takes effect after the time delay \u0394>0.

Fixing r=10 and qHp=1, we select p=0.2, p=0.1 and p=0.05 respectively. When r=10, qHp=1 and p=0.2, two poles of the closed-loop system are outside of the unit circle as shown in Table 1. From the theorem, we can judge that the spreading behavior is unstable, and the decision is also proved by the result of simulation, depicted in Fig. 2(a). We can see that, the predictive controlled small-world spreading model oscillates, and furthermore it is discovered from the simulations that the spreading behavior even diverges if the output constraint is not considered. When r=10, qHp=1 and p=0.1, three roots of polynomial T(z)=0 are all inside the unit circle, so the closed-loop system is stable as shown in Fig. 2(c). Further decreasing the rewiring probability p to 0.05 results in a more stable spreading dynamics, which can be found by comparing Fig. 2(c) with Fig. 2(e). The stability of the predictive controlled small-world spreading model is illustrated in Figs. 2(b), 2(d) and 2(f) when fixing r=5, qHp=1 and varying p from 0.2 to 0.1 and then to 0.05. Large simulations are performed and a similar phenomenon is discovered that, with the fixed controller parameters r and qHp, the dynamics of the small-world spreading model with predictive controller become more and more stable when rewiring probability p decreases from a larger value to a smaller one.",
