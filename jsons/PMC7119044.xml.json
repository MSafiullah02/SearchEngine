Some of the factors to be considered in developing or redefining a local pneumonia protocol are listed here. Obviously, some cost is going to be expended. Hospital administrators need to be convinced that the pneumonia protocol is valuable. Certainly, adverse publicity can be avoided with good adherence. Local pneumonia protocols could be cost-saving, because fewer health care dollars would be spent by identifying patients who have mild disease and could be treated at home. Information from 2007 guidelines on site of care should provide important criteria [26], [27]. The cost differential is hundreds of dollars for outpatient treatment compared with thousands of dollars for an admission. Adherence to protocols also has resulted in shorter hospitalization stays with cost savings.",

The ED physician should identify the patient with a realistic possibility of pneumonia and differentiate patients presenting with other illnesses and similar symptoms (see Fig. 2). Information obtained from the history and physical examination should be helpful in making alternative diagnoses more or less likely. The presence of underlying diseases and medication history may be useful in defining the type of pneumonia and profiling its severity. Metlay and colleagues [29] reported that the absence of any vital sign abnormality or any abnormalities on chest auscultation can substantially reduce the likelihood of CAP. Several studies, including an emergency medicine evidenced-based review [30], make the point that there is no one historical finding or physical examination finding or combination of findings that can accurately rule in or rule out the diagnosis of pneumonia. Nevertheless, it is still recommended by these authors that history and physical examination findings can help to contribute to the diagnosis of pneumonia; thus, the concept of performing a complete history and physical examination findings continue to be an integral part of evaluating these patients. Moreover, pertinent history and examination findings can help the emergency physician to determine if certain organisms are more likely causative agents and whether antimicrobial resistance is likely.",

An early report by Heckerling and colleagues [31] determined that certain findings, such as fever, tachycardia, decreased breath sounds, and absence of asthma were predictors of finding CAP on CXR. Subsequent studies suggest that no one symptom, sign or examination finding is statistically powerful enough to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of pneumonia on CXR. The absence of any vital sign abnormality, coupled with a normal examination, may nearly excluded the diagnosis, with only a 5% miss rate, as reported recently by O'Brien and colleagues [32]. Despite the lack of predictors to rule in the diagnosis, several vital sign abnormalities (hypoxia, fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea) make the diagnosis of pneumonia more likely [33]. Most consensus recommendations state that a CXR should be obtained in patients older than the age of 40 years and in patients with abnormal vital signs or physical examination findings or the presence of significant comorbidities.",

In one study, one third of admitted patients were found to have a normal CXR on admission, and these patients had similar rates of positive blood and sputum cultures [34]. Although the CXR is still considered the standard of care for diagnosing CAP, high-resolution CT scanning may be more sensitive. In a frequently cited study [35], chest radiography missed 31% of cases of possible pneumonia (8 of 26 cases) that were subsequently diagnosed on high-resolution CT. Diagnosis by CT is being made even more commonly, given the increasing numbers of CT scans done to rule out common causes of chest pain, such as CT pulmonary embolus studies to rule out pulmonary embolus and CT aneurysm studies to rule out aortic dissection. The precise role of CT scanning to rule in or rule out CAP remains to be determined, however, and studies connecting the CT diagnosis with some microbiologic diagnoses are still lacking.",

The PSI was made up of 20 variables and was somewhat cumbersome to use in many EDs. The 2007 guidelines favor the CURB65 (see Box 1) designed by the British Thoracic Society [27]. Only 5 variables are required: newly developed confusion (C), uremia (U), increased respiratory rate (R), decreased blood pressure (B) and age older than 65 years. Niederman [39] suggested that the two instruments should be complementary, because each has its limitations. Although the PSI has been used to determine which patients have a low mortality risk, it can occasionally underestimate CAP severity, especially in younger patients who do not have comorbid illnesses. In one study comparing both instruments in patients in the ED [40], both successfully predicted which patients had a low risk for mortality. The CURB65 had a better gradation of severe disease, however, with those patients having scores from 2 to 5 having a progressively greater mortality rate compared with the PSI, which has only two categories of severe illness (IV and V). Interestingly, both tools were designed to predict mortality and not to determine the optimal site of care. Renaud and colleagues [41] found that the routine use of the PSI increased the percentage of patients in PSI classes I and II who were treated as outpatients (42.8%) compared with an ED in which the PSI was not routinely used (23.9%). The increased outpatient treatment was not associated with any compromise in patient safety. The accompanying editorial by Marrie [42] emphasized the need for prospective trials of patients discharged from the ED and managed on an ambulatory basis.",

Certainly, the low mortality rate in patients treated at home does not justify a search for an etiologic agent. The criticism of routinely obtaining blood cultures is that studies show that they rarely change therapy. A recent emergency medicine study reported that blood cultures altered therapy in only 3.6% of patients and that most of these were changes to narrow therapy, with only 1.0% of patients having their antibiotics broadened [51]. The accompanying editorial by Moran and Abrahamian [52] rationalized that blood cultures still make sense for patients in the ICU because they are more likely to be bacteremic and they are more at risk should empiric therapy be inappropriate. The editorial by Walls and Resnick [23] in the same issue criticized the JCAHO and CMS for adopting the original policy to require blood cultures for all admitted patients who have CAP, because the weight of evidence clearly does not support this. The 2007 guidelines recommend obtaining blood and respiratory cultures in all patients admitted to the ICU. They also suggest obtaining blood cultures in a subset of patients admitted to the ward who have comorbid conditions associated with potentially higher bacteremic rates. Blood cultures should be obtained before empiric antimicrobial therapy. If patients were pretreated with antibiotics, blood cultures still should be obtained in appropriate patients, because resistant organisms may be present. In patients who have bacteremia, antimicrobial susceptibility can guide continued therapy and the appropriate switch to oral agents.",
