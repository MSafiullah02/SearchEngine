            "text": "Introduction: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) result in substantial annual morbidity among military personnel and decrease operational readiness. Herein, we summarize the research efforts of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP) related to ARIs. Methods: The ARI Research Area of the IDCRP was established in response to the 2009 emergence of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. That year, IDCRP investigators deployed the ARI Consortium Natural History Study (ARIC NHS), a multi-centered, longitudinal observational study to assess etiology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the U.S. military. The success of this initial effort spurred implementation of several new initiatives. These include the FluPlasma trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy of hyperimmune anti-influenza plasma for the treatment of severe influenza; the self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (SNIF) trial, which assessed the immunogenicity and acceptance of a self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine in military personnel; the Study to Address Threats of ARI in Congregate Military Populations (ATARI), a prospective study of ILI transmission, etiology and epidemiology in recruits; and the Flu Breath Test (FBT) study, a preliminary study of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC) in influenza patients. In addition, the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) survey, a daily diary to measure influenza symptoms during clinical trials, was developed. Lastly, the Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED) study, a two-year randomized trial designed to compare the effectiveness of the three types of licensed vaccines, launched in Fall 2018. Results: The on-going ARIC NHS has enrolled over 2000 ILI and SARI cases since its inception, providing data on burden and clinical manifestations of ARI in military personnel and their families. The FluPlasma 2 trial concluded subject enrollment in 2018. Preliminary results from ATARI study show a high frequency of respiratory viruses circulating during the first two weeks of recruit training. Based on assessment of FLU-PRO responses, which were found to be reliable and reproducible, the survey may be a useful tool in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. The Flu Breath Study will complete enrollment in 2019. Findings from PAIVED are intended to provide evidence needed for assessing influenza vaccination policy in the military. Conclusions: The ARI burden in the armed services remains significant every year and the threat is dynamic given emergent and evolving threats, such as influenzas. With strong successes to date, future initiatives of the ARI Research Area will focus on interventional studies, ARI transmission dynamics in congregate military settings, and determinants of risk of pandemic influenza and other emergent respiratory viruses.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) have compromised military readiness and threatened the health of U.S. military personnel since the Revolutionary War where approximately one-third of soldiers were hospitalized from various respiratory illnesses. 1 During the 1918 influenza pandemic, an estimated 46,640 deaths among U.S. military members were due to influenza and its complications. 2 Between the First and Second World Wars, a number of health promotion strategies were implemented, including healthier living conditions and quarantine, which contributed to the reduction of ARI-related morbidity and mortality in World War II. 2 In the following decades, outbreaks of adenovirus infection occurring almost exclusively in military recruits were identified. 3 Soon thereafter, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and the National Institutes of Health developed a live-attenuated adenovirus vaccine. Routine immunization of recruits resulted in~50-60% declines in overall ARI, and by the early 1970s, vaccination for adenovirus became standard. 4 Service members are at heightened risk for ARI because missions often require living/working under stressful and crowded conditions, in environments where respiratory infections are endemic, and have inadequate access to hygiene. In these military training/deployment settings, the person-to-person transmission of respiratory pathogens is enhanced. Between 2012 and 2014, ARIs were responsible for up to 400,000 clinical visits each year, affecting more than 500,000 active-duty personnel and resulting in up to 95,000 lost duty days. Influenza alone accounted for 13,400 hospital bed days annually from 2011-2013. In particular, the rate of respiratory illness among deployed military personnel was~69% in Iraq and~40% in Afghanistan with performance being affected in 34% of cases between 2005 and 2006. 5 Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has been the need to reintroduce the adenovirus vaccine for military trainees, respond to transient outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in civilian populations, manage a novel pandemic North American H1N1 influenza, and closely monitor the periodic emergence of different highly virulent avian influenza viruses and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV). All these events remind us that ARIs pose considerable risk to public health, national security, and military readiness; [5] [6] [7] [8] both from the threat of sudden catastrophic epidemics, and importantly from the persistent burden and readiness impact exerted by more ubiquitous respiratory pathogens that result in \"non-severe\" but temporarily disabling illness.",

Using data collected through ARIC NHS, species-specific differences in clinical severity and viral shedding were demonstrated with human rhinovirus (HRV), a major cause of ILI. In particular, HRV-A was predominant in adults, and was associated with a greater severity of upper respiratory symptoms compared to HRV-B along with a significantly longer duration of viral shedding versus HRV-C. Age-specific differences were also observed with HRV-C being more common in children versus adults. 12 The clinical characteristics of adenovirus have also been assessed among febrile ILI patients enrolled in ARIC NHS. Over a five-year period, 3% of febrile ILI patients were positive for adenovirus with species C being the most common. Approximately half of the adenovirus cases were positive for at least one other respiratory pathogen, primarily influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. When symptoms were assessed, children positive for non-C adenovirus had a higher proportion of sore throats and hoarseness, indicating potential species-specific virulence differences, as well as variations in the host response to infection. 8 Furthermore, 12% of ILI patients enrolled in ARIC NHS were positive for human coronavirus (HCoV) with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E being the most common with season-to-season variability. 13 Most HRV-C occurred in children.

In addition, bacterial and non-influenza pathogens were more frequently detected in ILI cases than in SARI cases. The results suggest that SARI cases have a greater likelihood to be associated with pathogens that cause more severe symptoms than those responsible for ILI. The findings also highlight the diversity of pathogens that may cause ILI in trainees. It is also important to note that for both ILI and SARI cases, pathogens could not be detected in half the samples using PCR-based assays.",

The development of such a systematic measure would have substantial value for public health in terms of use as a validated outcome measure regarding interventions to treat or prevent influenza. A standardized method could also serve as an overall measure of influenza severity. Therefore, in collaboration with NIAID and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we developed the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) daily diary to act as a standardized, measure scale of patient influenza symptoms to evaluate the occurrence, severity, and duration of influenza symptoms during clinical trials. Thirty-seven drafted questions 14 were finalized into a 32-item measure of influenza symptoms across six body regions (e.g., nose, throat, eyes, and chest) and evaluated using a 5-point ordinal system. Use of FLU-PRO was assessed based on information from 200 ILI patients (28% hospitalized during illness) and the questionnaire scores were found to be reliable, reproducible, and valid, indicating its usefulness in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. 15 Specifically, FLU-PRO may provide valuable insight into treatment efficacy and safety with greater precision and less bias than non-standardized metrics in FDA-regulated studies.",

Among enrolled patients positive for influenza, 24% were prescribed neuraminidase inhibitors (more than half within 48 hours of symptom onset). Between patients who were and were not treated with neuraminidase inhibitors, there was no significant difference in symptoms; however, early receipt (within 48 hours) had a moderate benefit related to symptoms and duration of illness. 16 In an examination of clinical characteristics of ILI patients within the Military Health System stratified by hospitalization status, hospitalized patients were less likely to have received influenza vaccination and more likely to receive treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor. Obesity and influenza A infection were also associated with increased risks for hospitalization. Furthermore, patients with influenza requiring hospitalization were more likely to be febrile, but otherwise presented with similar symptoms (e.g., chills, cough, and sore throat) as outpatients. 17 Incidence rates of ILI for trainees are typically based on passive surveillance of those presenting to medical clinics. Such clinic-based surveillance may under-estimate the actual ILI burden because trainees with ILI may not seek healthcare due to mild symptoms or fear of missing training. Initial findings from the anonymous survey of advanced trainees regarding their health-seeking behaviors indicated 68% trainees reported ILI symptoms during training. 18 Of those reporting ILI, only 36% sought healthcare. The barriers to care-seeking in patients with ILI in a high risk, military population, are not well understood. The next phase of this study will focus on discerning the obstacles to seeking care for ILI with the overall goal of developing interventions designed to lower disease transmission in trainees.",

[25] [26] [27] [28] Research area investigators have conducted multiple studies focused on the response and effectiveness of vaccinations. Use of a selfadministered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (SNIF) was assessed in a phase IV, open-label randomized control trial involving 1077 subjects. Seroresponse between subjects who self-administered and those who had the vaccine administered by a healthcare profession did not differ. Prior to vaccine administration, there was no preference in method; however, at follow-up, 64% of subjects who selfadministered expressed a preference for that method. 29 Antibody response to the influenza vaccine among adults with HIV infections was also evaluated in one study and HIV-infected adults were less likely to generate a seroprotective response compared to adults without HIV infection. These findings indicate that despite receiving influenza vaccinations, adults with HIV infections may remain vulnerable to the disease. 30 Furthermore, the degree to which influenza vaccinations attenuate symptoms was assessed in another study involving 155 influenza-positive patients enrolled ARIC NHS (111 vaccinated). Patients who received a vaccination were significantly less likely to experience fever >-101\u00b0F or myalgias. When influenza species was considered, there was a significant reduction in symptoms among patients positive for Influenza A/H3N2 who received a vaccination; however, there was no difference in disease severity with vaccination status among patients positive for Influenza A/H1N1. 31 Annual immunization for influenza is mandatory for DoD personnel; however, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine has been shown to be suboptimal and warrants further investigation. Vaccine effectiveness is typically estimated using the test negative design, comparing proportions of influenza vaccination among patients with and without influenza. An analysis of influenza vaccine effectiveness conducted with ARIC NHS data in 2015 showed the vaccine effectiveness was below 35%. 32 The findings were consistent with those from the CDC and other sources, highlighting the poor effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine. These data also raise concerns that repeated immunization with seasonal influenza may increase susceptibility to influenza and severe illness. 33 In some influenza seasons, attack rates appear to be higher for people who were vaccinated during both the current and the prior year's influenza seasons compared to individuals who had only been vaccinated during the current season. Elucidating the relationship between repeated vaccinations and protection would have important implications for influenza vaccination policy. To date, the results from epidemiological studies have been conflicting. Nevertheless, examination of 155 influenza cases in the ARIC NHS (111 vaccinated) found that upper respiratory and overall symptoms were significantly less during the first two days of illness among vaccinated individuals. 31 The aim of the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Study is to explore the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza acquisition and severity in DoD populations based on a review of electronic medical records. Specifically, the study will assess the influence of antigenic components of the vaccine and the predominant influenza strain on vaccine effectiveness. The findings will provide preliminary data for the development of more definitive studies.",

In addition, patients who received plasma had less serious adverse effects (20% vs 38%; p = 0.041).
