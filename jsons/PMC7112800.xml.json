Presently, only four studies have reported the establishment of cell cultures from bovine intestinal cells (Birkner et al., 2004, Follmann et al., 2000, Hoey et al., 2003, Rusu et al., 2005). These studies described the generation of epithelial cell cultures from the colon of fetal cattle and the jejunum and colon of adult cattle. The cell lines established from adult cattle may not be relevant for the study of enteric infection, such as by rotavirus or coronavirus, since these viruses infect enterocytes in the small intestine of young calves.",

Considering the difficulties associated with establishing epithelial cell cultures from the small intestine of cattle, previous studies of enteric pathogens have been performed using heterologous cell lines. For example, studies of bovine rotavirus (BRV) have been performed using mouse, monkey and human cell lines (Bass et al., 1990, Bugarcic and Taylor, 2006, Lee et al., 1998). Although clearly valuable, information obtained using these heterologous cell culture models may not be fully applicable to cattle given known differences in rotavirus strains, species barriers, cellular receptors and factors required for rotavirus uptake, infectivity, replication and pathogenesis (Estes et al., 2001, Lopez and Arias, 2006, Pesavento et al., 2006, Ramig, 2004). Therefore, in order to examine the role of intestinal epithelial cells in pathogen attachment, invasion, and to define molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, autologous host cell cultures are required.",

Therefore, we investigated the use of different dissociation agents and digestion protocols to identify the best method for isolating and culturing viable epithelial cells from fetal intestine. Intestine was collected from two 110\u2013130-day-old fetuses, cut into 25\u201330 mm2 pieces, and placed in teflon-coated 50 ml beakers. Four different epithelial cells dissociation protocols were evaluated: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone; PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA; PBS supplemented with 0.25% trypsin (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Canada); or PBS supplemented with collagenase (100 U/ml; Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Canada). Tissues were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and stirred at a low speed for 15\u201330 min using a small magnetic stir bar before collecting the supernatant and centrifuging at 400 \u00d7 \ng for 7 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells from each tissue digestion condition were divided in half, re-suspended in either DMEM-10 or EGF-10 medium (described below), and cultured in 6-well plates for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Non-adherent cells were removed and discarded and the adherent cells were collected after trypsinization. Cytospins were prepared with the adherent cell fraction resulting from each intestinal cell isolation method and stained to quantify the percentage cytokeratin and vimentin positive cells (procedure described below). The results of these studies were used to define the enzymatic digest conditions used for epithelial cell isolation.",

Therefore, monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for cytokeratin and vimentin were used to quantify the percentage of epithelial cells and fibroblasts present in primary intestinal cell cultures. For immunohistochemical (IHC) studies, primary ileal and jejunal cell cultures were incubated with trypsin\u2013EDTA for 5\u201310 min at 37 \u00b0C to detach cells from the plastic. Cells were then washed twice with PBS before preparing cytospins using a cytofuge (Cytospin 3; Thermo Shandon Inc., PA, USA). Cytospins were air-dried, fixed in acetone and stored at 4 \u00b0C until stained with MoAbs specific for cytokeratin and vimentin. Briefly, slides were equilibrated at room temperature, rehydrated in PBS (pH 7.2) and then incubated with PBS containing 1% goat serum to block non-specific protein binding. Slides were incubated with either MoAb C6909 (clone K8.13, IgG2a isotype; cytokeratin) or V5255 (clone VIM 13.2, IgM isotype; vimentin) for 1 h.

MoAbs M9144 (IgG2a isotype) and M5170 (IgM isotype) were used as irrelevant isotype-matched controls. All MoAbs were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Canada and used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml. Slides were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with isotype-specific, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG2a or IgM antisera (Caltag laboratories, USA; 1:2000 dilution) for 30 min.

Repeated treatment of the primary cultures with trypsin\u2013EDTA was also used to selectively remove fibroblasts. Immunohistochemical staining of cells obtained following trypsin\u2013EDTA treatment confirmed that the majority of the cells being removed were vimentin positive and cytokeratin negative (data not shown). Thus, the cells being removed were primarily mesenchymal cells and removal of these cells provided additional space for epithelial cell growth. At the end of the 11\u201312-day primary culture period, there was a confluent monolayer of cells and these cells were split 1:2 and transferred to new flasks (P-1). The transferred cells appeared to be a homogenous population with a cobblestone appearance in both jejunal (Fig. 1D) and ileal (Fig. 1H) cultures. These cultures were confluent within 5\u20136 days of passage and were maintained by making 1:2 or 1:3 splits with each subsequent passage.

The percentage of cytokeratin positive cells ranged between 62 and 75% at P-6 which indicated that the low serum culture conditions and repeated treatment with trypsin\u2013EDTA was unable to eliminate mesenchymal cell contamination.

Jejunal and ileal intestinal cell suspensions were obtained with collagenase digestion as described earlier but the primary cell cultures were initiated in EGF-1 medium. As observed previously, the majority of cells died during the first 48\u201372 h in culture with a small number of organoids attached to the plastic. The surviving cells were maintained in EGF-1 media throughout the study and within 8\u20139 days there was an outgrowth of cells from individual organoids. The development of a confluent monolayer in these primary cultures required approximately 18 days which was a significant delay when compared to previous primary cultures established with EGF-10 medium. The majority of cells in the cultures established with EGF-1 medium displayed cobblestone morphology but the cultures were still treated with a 1:5 diluted trypsin\u2013EDTA at room temperature for 2\u20133 min to remove fibroblast-like cells. Three days later, the cultures were again confluent and cells were collected for immunohistochemical staining and passage to new flasks. Approximately 91% of the jejunal cells (Fig. 3B) and 85% of the ileal cells (Fig. 3F) stained visibly for cytokeratin. In contrast, only 48% of the jejunal cells (Fig. 3D) and 46% of the ileal cells (Fig. 3H) stained visibly for vimentin. These results and previous IHC results (Table 1) suggested that cultured epithelial cells contained both cytokeratin and vimentin. Furthermore, establishing primary intestinal cell cultures in EGF-1 provided a selective advantage for epithelial cells but the growth of these cells was much slower when compared to cultures established with EGF-10 medium.",

BRV infection of fibroblasts would not be consistent with the known tropism of BRV for mucosal epithelial cells.

Therefore, it was important to determine if BRV infection resulted in the lysis of the cultured jejunal and ileal epithelial cells. The reduced viability of these cells at 16 h pi (Fig. 5D) indicated that incubation beyond this time point might induce lysis of infected cells. Epithelial cell cultures were infected with BRV (MOI = 50) and checked for a cytopathic effect (CPE) at 24, 48 and 72 h pi. At 24 h pi, CPE was apparent in both jejunal and ileal cell cultures with dead cells present in the culture supernatant (data not shown). There was no visible sign of cell death in jejunal fibroblast cultures at 24 h pi and the cellular monolayer remained intact (data not shown). At 48 h pi, numerous dead cells were present in the culture medium and the cell monolayer was extensively disrupted in both the jejunal (Fig. 7B) and ileal (Fig. 7D) epithelial cell cultures. In contrast, the jejunal fibroblast culture did not show visible signs of CPE until 72 h pi (Fig. 7F). These observations confirmed that BRV infection was lytic within both epithelial and fibroblast cultures but cell lysis was delayed at least 48 h in the fibroblast culture. In the same experiment, supernatants from BRV uninfected and infected (12.5 \u00d7 106\n pfu/well) jejunal and ileal cultures were collected 48 h pi. Infectious virus recovered in jejunal and ileal culture supernatants were 50 \u00d7 106 and 175 \u00d7 106\n pfu, respectively. These values are a minimal estimate of viral replication since virus present within infected cells was not measured.",

Therefore, a second objective of the present study was to use BRV as a model pathogen to determine if cultured bovine intestinal epithelial cells were competent target cells for viral infection. To confirm that the response to viral infection was specific we tested the cultured epithelial cells to confirm that they were not infected with either BVDV1 or BVDV2. Protocols were established which supported the isolation and culture of cytokeratin positive cells from both the jejunum and ileum of bovine fetuses. These protocols were applicable irrespective of the various age of fetuses used in the present study. The developmental and differentiation states of the cultured epithelial cells were not, however, checked by special methods such as by electron microscopy, biochemical analysis, enzyme profiling or polarizing cultures on membrane filters. Therefore, we did not determine if fetal age influenced epithelial cell differentiation or function.",

The main advantage of enzymatic digestion of intestinal tissue is that it may preserve more cell-to-cell interactions, including close contact between pericryptal fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Collagenase and dispase digestion have been reported to provide incomplete disaggregation of cells and result in viable epithelial organoids (Booth et al., 1995b, Evans et al., 1992, Kaeffer, 2002, Macartney et al., 2000). Some of these organoids are presumably derived from crypts which contain epithelial stem cells capable of generating epithelial cells in vitro (Macartney et al., 2000). We consistently observed the outgrowth of epithelial cell foci from intestinal organoids and the incomplete digestion of epithelial tissues with collagenase provided the most consistent generation of epithelial cell cultures (Fig. 1). While standardizing the culture conditions we initially used collagenase at 100 U/ml concentrations but to increase the yield of epithelial cells and crypts, we increased the concentrations of collagenase to 800 U/ml in subsequent experiments. Earlier studies also recommended using more than 100 U collagenase/ml (Rusu et al., 2005; Kaeffer, 2002) when establishing primary bovine and murine intestinal epithelial cultures.",

            "text": "There are two major problems which must be overcome when culturing primary intestinal epithelial cells. These problems include the rapid death of isolated epithelial cells and fibroblast overgrowth of cultured epithelial cells (Kaeffer, 2002). The primary reason for rapid death of isolated epithelial cells may be disruption of epithelial cell contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) which triggers programmed cell death/apoptosis. This phenomenon is called \u2018anoikis\u2019 and intestinal epithelial stem cells are very sensitive to anoikis (Frisch and Francis, 1994, Kaeffer, 2002, Strater et al., 1996). Plastic surfaces coated with laminin, the collagen family of molecules, or metrigel may improve epithelial cell survival, growth, and differentiation (Follmann et al., 2000, Kaeffer, 2002, Macartney et al., 2000, Rusu et al., 2005). Therefore, isolated bovine intestinal cells were cultured in Primaria flasks in which the plastic surface was coated with nitrogen-containing functional groups in addition to negatively charged oxygen-containing groups. Primaria flasks have been reported to improve the attachment and differentiation of a variety of cell types (Chilkoti et al., 1995, Boisclair et al., 2000, Braun et al., 1996, Holgado-Madruga et al., 1997). We observed the outgrowth of epithelial cell foci from organoids when using Primaria flasks (Fig. 1) but there was still extensive cell death during the first 24\u201348 h of culture. Thus, using Primaria flasks was not sufficient to rescue many of the cells present in the single cell suspension generated by collagenase digestion.",

            "text": "Numerous strategies had been described for the control of fibroblast growth in primary intestinal epithelial cells cultures. These methods include the use of l-valine deficient medium (Hoey et al., 2003, Sordillo et al., 1988), low serum (\u22642%) supplementation of growth media (Flint et al., 1994, Macartney et al., 2000), density gradients to enrich crypt epithelium in the original cell suspensions (Follmann et al., 2000, Hoey et al., 2003, Macartney et al., 2000, Rusu et al., 2005), and brief treatment of cultures with trypsin, dispase or pepsin to selectively remove fibroblasts (Hague and Paraskeva, 1996, Radi and Ackermann, 2004). A wide variety of specific nutrients and growth factors such as insulin, insulin-like factor-1, heparin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), colony stimulating factor-1, transferrin, selenium, hydrocortisone, sodium pyruvate have also been used to enhance epithelial cell growth in cultures (Booth et al., 1995a, Chopra et al., 1987, Flint et al., 1994, Kaeffer, 2002, Ramsay et al., 2004). We were able to maintain enriched epithelial cell cultures for a period of 60 days by using a variety of these strategies. The culture medium used in the present study was supplemented with a variety of epithelial cell growth factors but despite the use of these supplements epithelial cell growth slowed after 4\u20136 passages and was negligible after 8 passages. This growth period exceeded that reported in earlier studies for bovine intestinal epithelial cells (Birkner et al., 2004, Follmann et al., 2000, Hoey et al., 2003, Rusu et al., 2005). The more prolonged growth of fetal intestinal epithelial cells may have been due to the synergistic effects of apo-transferrin, epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and bovine insulin (Kaeffer, 2002, Kedinger et al., 1987, Macartney et al., 2000) and the enhanced growth potential of fetal epithelial cells. It has been reported that murine intestinal crypt stem cells undergo functional changes with age and this may account for the difficulty in establishing primary cultures from young or adult animals (Kaeffer, 2002, Kondo et al., 1984, Martin et al., 1998). We also used fetal intestinal tissues rather than adult intestinal tissue since many enteric pathogens selectively infect the neonate. For example, BRV primarily infects and causes clinical disease and mortality in newborn calves (Saif and Smith, 1985).",

The density gradient protocol used by others (Follmann et al., 2000, Hoey et al., 2003, Macartney et al., 2000, Rusu et al., 2005) to enrich cellular aggregates/crypts added significantly more time before cells could be cultured and resulted in relatively low cell yields. Fibroblast contamination of bovine epithelial cultures was also an important factor even when primary cultures were established with crypts or cell aggregates obtained by 2% sorbitol gradient method (Follmann et al., 2000, Hoey et al., 2003). The use of a low percentage of FCS in the medium or l-valine deficient medium were still required to minimize fibroblast growth in these cultures. Earlier studies indicated that the addition of irradiated fibroblasts or conditioned medium was required to support primary epithelial cell growth (Hague and Paraskeva, 1996, Kaeffer, 2002; Perreault and Beaulieu, 1998; Perreault and Jean-Francois, 1996). Other studies also indicated that presence of non-epithelial cell types were required to support the growth and viability of primary epithelial cells (Booth et al., 1995b, Evans et al., 1992, Macartney et al., 2000). Therefore, we did not use the density gradient method in the present intestinal epithelial cell isolation protocol.",

Epithelial cell cultures were routinely treated with trypsin\u2013EDTA (1\u00d7) solution (diluted 1:5 in versene) for a brief period to selectively remove fibroblasts. We did not observe any morphological changes in the trypsin-treated and non-treated cell cultures but cannot exclude possible effects of trypsin\u2013EDTA treatment on the epithelial cells. Epithelial cells were, however, incubated with media containing FBS immediately after trypsin treatment which effectively neutralizes trypsin activity. It is important to note that the bovine jejunal fibroblast cultures which were not periodically treated with trypsin\u2013EDTA displayed a similar level of BRV infection as the bovine jejunal and ileal epithelial cultures (Fig. 6). This suggests that mild trypsin\u2013EDTA treatment did not have a significant effect on epithelial cell infection by rotavirus. Furthermore, rotavirus infection of epithelial cells requires that rotavirus be cultured in the presence of trypsin or the virus must be treated with trypsin prior to addition to the culture (Sabara et al., 1985, Macartney et al., 2000, Lee et al., 1998, Vijay-Kumar et al., 2005, Cuadras et al., 2002, Bugarcic and Taylor, 2006). These studies indicate that trypsin treatment is required for epithelial cell infection by rotavirus.",

It has been previously reported that intestinal epithelial cells cultured from cattle and other species may contain both cytokeratin and vimentin (Kaeffer et al., 1993, Kedinger et al., 1987, Rusu et al., 2005) despite the apparent absence of vimentin in mucosal epithelial cells. Consistent with these findings, we observed that the percentage of vimentin containing cells increased in both jejunal and ileal cultures as the passage number increased (Table 1). Previous studies reported that level of cytokeratin within each cell or the percentage of cytokeratin positive cells may decrease when intestinal epithelial cells are cultured (Blay and Brown, 1984, Whitehead et al., 1993). There was not, however, a significant decrease in the percentage of cytokeratin positive cells in either the ileal and jejunal cultures (Table 1). The presence of both cytokeratin and vimentin in epithelial cells observed in the present study might be a normal biological phenomenon in cultured intestinal epithelial cells but the absence of cytokeratin staining in bovine jejunal fibroblasts cultures indicated that cytokeratin is unique to epithelial cells. Collectively, these observations indicate that monitoring cytokeratin may provide the most specific method to determine purity of epithelial cell cultures.",

In some studies, an MOI of 20\u201330 was used for rotavirus infection of human epithelial cell lines (Vijay-Kumar et al., 2005, Cuadras et al., 2002) but a recent rotavirus infection study demonstrated that bovine and porcine epithelial cell lines were 5\u201310-fold less susceptible to rotavirus infection than MA 104 or human Caco-2 cells (Ciarlet et al., 2002). It was concluded that a high MOI should be used to successfully infect bovine epithelial cultures. In the present study we used a BRV lab-adapted strain C486, in contrast to the wild-type strains used by others, to infect the cultured bovine intestinal epithelial cell. This strain has previously been used at a high MOI to infect epithelial cultures (Lee et al., 1998, Sabara et al., 1985). Therefore, we used BRV strain C486 at MOIs of 30 and 50 for infectivity and cytopathic effect (CPE) studies, respectively.",

The epithelial cultures were incubated with BRV for only 16 h based on an earlier rotavirus study conducted with Caco-2 cells (Cuadras et al., 2002). We also observed that the viability of BRV-infected epithelial cells began to decline at 16 h pi (Fig. 5). Rotavirus is a lytic virus and when infected jejunal and ileal epithelial cultures were incubated for a longer period of time extensive CPE was observed (Fig. 7). Furthermore, infectious virus was also recovered in the culture supernatants of infected epithelial cells confirming that viral replication had occurred. These observations are consistent with previous reports for rotavirus infection in a variety of other cell types (Jourdan et al., 1997, Macartney et al., 2000, McNulty et al., 1977, Svensson et al., 1991). Thus, cultured jejunal and ileal epithelial cells appear to function as competent host cells for BRV infection and replication studies.",

No studies have specifically reported fibroblast infection by BRV and viral tropism is thought to be specific for mucosal epithelial cells (Holland, 1990, Ramig, 2004, Saif and Smith, 1985). Interestingly, we observed the presence of BRV protein in the majority of fibroblasts following exposure to virus (Fig. 6) but viral-induced CPE was markedly delayed in fibroblast cultures (Fig. 7). These observations indicate that BRV can infect cultured intestinal fibroblasts but the delayed lysis of infected cells suggests an altered viral\u2013host cell interaction when compared to epithelial cells. The presence of fibroblasts among cultured intestinal epithelial cells may, however, complicate the interpretation of results when the objective of a study is to specifically study epithelial cell responses to viral infection.",

These cells could be cultured for an interval sufficient to generate a relatively large number of epithelial cells. For example, if all cells in the primary cultures were maintained with each passage then following eight serial passages there was the potential to expand the primary epithelial culture between 256-fold (1:2 split; 28) to over 6500-fold (1:3 split; 38). Thus, there is the potential to generate a relatively large number of epithelial cells for host\u2013pathogen interaction studies. A variety of methods were required throughout the culture period to control fibroblast growth but it was not possible to completely eliminate these cells. Therefore, the presence of fibroblasts will need to be considered when using cultured intestinal epithelial cells for investigating host cell responses to an enteric pathogen unless the tropism of the pathogen is known to be epithelial cell specific.",
