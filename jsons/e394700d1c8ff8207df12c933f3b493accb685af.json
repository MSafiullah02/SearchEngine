No gold standard exists for measures of retention, and each measure has its own set of advantages and limitations; however, all of these measures center around in-person clinic visits, including measures of visit frequency, gaps between visits, and so on [1] [2] [3] . We are now facing a pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 that is disrupting our healthcare system and the way we deliver face-to-face care. The pandemic has forced us to undergo a drastic and rapid switch to telehealth for most of our patient visits. This reduces risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinic setting and with travel to and from clinic [4] . In this pandemic, telemedicine has emerged, out of necessity, as a tool for safely keeping our patients engaged in care. Its use challenges traditional measures of retention and offers a unique opportunity to study telehealth as a new tool for keeping patients in HIV care.",

We use Zoom\u00ae for video visits with end-to-end encryption and password protection. If a video visit is not feasible, we switch to audio only. We use landline or mobile telephone to connect with a small number of patients (less than 10%) who do not have smart phones.

Physical exams are not possible since patients are not equipped with telemonitoring devices.",

We posited that telehealth could address common barriers to retention in HIV care, including difficulties with transportation, inflexible work schedules, stressful life events, and stigma and fear of being seen at the HIV clinic. Overall, patients had a positive attitude and reported many potential benefits including better fit with work/ life schedules, reduced travel time, and having more privacy with the visit at home. However, 23% of patients had concerns about not being able to express themselves well, 37% had concerns about not having a physical exam, and 28% had concerns about the safety of their personal information over the internet. Interestingly, older age, lower income, and uncontrolled HIV (i.e., CD4 < 200) had no impact on the patients' attitude towards telehealth. However, patients who do not speak English as a first language and those with less education were less willing to use telehealth [6] .",

While switching to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic has required a steep mental shift, most of our providers have found telehealth an acceptable alternative and easy to use. The time allocated for visits has been sufficient, and there have been few if any technical problems. A delightful upside to videobased visits is the provider's ability to see their patient's home and the social context of their patient's environment. These include family members who patients invite to join the call, but who otherwise would not have attended a visit. Visits are often less formal, and patients seem more relaxed in the comfort of their homes, opening up more, smiling more. Additionally, patients who often forget to bring their medicine bottles or do not remember the names of the medicines they take can easily retrieve their medicines and confirm what they are taking. In general, providers felt they were able to communicate their message well with patients. However, most visits were conducted with established patients who the providers already know and with whom they have rapport.",

While patients and providers tend to view telehealth favorably during this crisis, we must consider how this will look in the long term, post-pandemic. Many questions remain. Historically, healthcare systems have used telehealth as a tool to increase access for patients who have not had good access to HIV care (e.g., rural patients and prison populations). However, when rolled out to the general population of patients with HIV infection, will certain subpopulations benefit more or less? Our team has published data showing the importance of effective communication and patient experience in predicting retention in HIV care [9] [10] [11] . In using telehealth, we must consider how telehealth alters communication and patient experience, and how differences in communication and patient experience may impact long term adherence and retention. Even when patients and providers favor the use of telehealth, the structure and content of their conversations might be altered in ways that neither the patient nor provider recognize. If telehealth is here to stay, what will retention look like if both telehealth and in-person visits are used? The time to start thinking about telehealth in the context of retention is now.",

Patient-related factors include willingness to use telehealth and the ability to use digital communication technology. Disease related factors need to be studied. For example, should patients with new HIV diagnoses always be seen in clinic, regardless of HIV stage? Should we offer telehealth to patients with uncontrolled HIV? On one hand these patients are more likely to have serious disease, and historically, be scheduled more frequent clinic visits. However, these patients are also likely the ones who have the most barriers to attending clinic visits (e.g., transportation, life change events). Studies are needed to understand how telehealth use will impact clinical outcomes, and how it could be incorporated into existing performance measures of retention in HIV care. Understanding how telehealth impacts completion of preventive services such as vaccinations and cancer screening is also necessary.",

Previous studies have found that patients tend to feel rushed during telehealth visits [12] , even though telehealth visits tend to be longer; providers use less encouraging language during telehealth visits [13] ; and these visits tend to be provider-dominated [14] .

Clinic pharmacies, such as ours, are now mailing patients their HIV medicines. Providers are checking safety labs and HIV viral loads less frequently. COVID-19 has forced health systems and providers to make these changes in an incredibly short period of time, and patients have relished them. The changes have also made providers rethink their practice. For example, given the high efficacy and excellent safety profile of the newer HIV medicines, do patients need safety labs and an HIV viral load every six months? Once the pandemic ends, health systems will also need to rethink their practice and ask if it makes sense to ever revert back.
