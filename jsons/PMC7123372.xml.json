Potential pathogenic microbial flora of the respiratory tract and of the vestibulum nasi, such as methicillin- sensible (MSSA) or resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is correlated with a higher risk of contamination of surrounding surfaces through direct or indirect contact with hands [81]. Intestinal infections caused i.e. by Clostridium difficile and Norovirus, or enteral colonization with nosocomial pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) may also be associated with a risk of widespread environmental contamination [30]. Compared with the large number of published literature on environmental contamination with MRSA, VRE, and C. difficile, there are relatively few published studies on environmental contamination by Gram-negative bacteria [64, 65]. Aside of a possible publication bias in the past, one reason for this is the different ability of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to survive in the inanimate environment.",

However, even at low particle numbers there is a risk of transmission (Table 2.1). In immuno-compromised patients, the required numbers of microorganisms for causing infectious diseases is even lower, increasing the risk of HAI in these populations. Inanimate surfaces have been described as source for HAI-outbreaks. Hayden et al. [49] demonstrated that touching the environment contaminated with relatively low pathogen concentrations in a room occupied by a patient colonized with VRE is associated with approximately the same risk of VRE acquisition on hands as touching an affected patient directly. Evidence of the importance of environmental transmission is further provided by studies showing an increased risk of infection in patients admitted to the same rooms previously occupied by other infected/colonised cases. This has been shown for C. difficile [101], VRE and MRSA ([54, 55], and also own observations). Environmental Norovirus contamination has been repeatedly found to be correlated with continuing outbreaks [128], although the significance of this pathway has not been fully elucidated.\n",

[56] have analysed the persistence of various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and Enterococcus hirae on office paper after contamination with standardised inocula of bacterial suspensions in the range of 2.8 \u00d7 107 cfu/mL. Opposite to E. coli, all other organisms were more stabile at room conditions and were reduced on paper only by 3 log10 after 7 days, whereas E. coli was reduced by 5 log10 within 24 h. Furthermore, the transmissibility of bacteria from hands to paper and back could be demonstrated for all bacteria strains. Similar investigations showed that paper money notes could harbour and transmit pathogens [62, 111, 115].",

Gram-positive cocci were most prevalent in indoor air, followed by Gram-positive rods (e.g. Bacillus spp. and Actinomycetes spp.), Gram-negative rods and Gram-negative cocci [103].

Adhesion triggers the expression of a sigma factor that depresses a large number of genes so that bacteria within the biofilm are at least 500 times more tolerable against antimicrobial agents [23] as well as against physical cold plasma [71, 72]. The reason for the unspecific increased tolerance is the production of extracellular substances like polysaccharides, proteins and DNA after attachment to surfaces. A precondition for biofilm formation is the presence of certain amounts of humidity. The biofilm matrix restrains water and nutrients and protects the microorganisms against environmental influences [28, 39]. Because of that, once formed biofilms are an important factor of persistence of microorganisms on surfaces in nature as well as in industrial or medical areas [22, 29, 12]. The persistence on inanimate surfaces is prolonged and depends of the environmental conditions, especially the humidity. Also on hospital surfaces biofilms were demonstrated on a number of objects and surfaces, such as sterile supply buckets, opaque plastic doors, venetian blind cords, and sink rubbers, and it was possible to cultivate viable bacteria. Currently, there is not enough research to elucidate whether presence or absence of biofilm affect the risk of transmission or possibility for cross-transmission. However, multi-drug resistant bacteria may not only be protected within biofilms, which may be the mechanism why they persist within the hospital environment [114], but may also exchange virulence factors among their own species or to other species present in biofilms as well [29, 43, 109].",

However, inconsistent results are reported for the influence of type of materials on microbial survival. Some authors described that the type of material did not affect the persistence of Echovirus, Adenovirus, Para-Influenza virus, Rotavirus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Poliovirus, or Norovirus. Other investigators found that persistence was favoured on non-porous surfaces for Influenza virus on formica and gloves for Respiratory syncytial virus, and on hand pieces of telephones for Feline calicivirus [64, 65]. Other factors for a longer persistence of viruses include the presence of faecal suspension and a higher bio-inoculum [66, 64, 65]. Interestingly and by nature, Urease activity enhances the survival of Haemophilus influenzae at a reduced pH [77].",

As consequence for the successful interruption of cross contamination and infections a multi-barrier approach is required with the key points of hand hygiene and surface disinfection, appropriate used of antisepsis, barrier nursing, and safe reprocessing of contaminated medical devices. Within such multi-barrier strategy, environmental disinfection policies should be based on risk assessments for surfaces with different risks for cross contamination such as high- and low-touched surfaces with appropriate standards for adequate disinfection measures. Generally, surface disinfection is indicated in the following situations:Frequently touched surfaces adjacent to patientsSurfaces with assumed or visible contaminationTerminal disinfection in rooms or areas where infected or colonized patients with easily transferable nosocomial pathogens are cared for, andin outbreak situations.\n",

In order to ensure the success of environmental disinfection, education, training [52], and targeted microbiological control are important measures and have been shown to improve both, cleaning performance and infection prevention [50]. Increasingly, novel technologies are introduced, which may be used additionally to cleaning. Such technologies may include antimicrobial surfaces on basis of different antimicrobial compounds and are provided for hospital door handles, alarm knobs, curtains, and other objects with high frequencies of hand contact. However, such technologies must be used appropriately and as an adjunct measure to meaningful cleaning and disinfection processes.",
