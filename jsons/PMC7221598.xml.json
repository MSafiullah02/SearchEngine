Moreover, while being included in the essential medicine lists of several countries as an antimalarial [14], chloroquine may hamper cardiac function at clinically relevant doses and its safety margin is very narrow. The proarrhythmic activity of chloroquine is mainly due to its capacity to inhibit the cardiac inward rectifier potassium current and further, it can induce lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The off-target activity partially stems from the blockades of the human ether-\u00e0-go-go related gene (hERG) [15] and Kir2.1 potassium [16] channels that may occur at low \u03bcM concentrations. Additionally, while therapeutic doses of chloroquine typically result in plasma concentrations of 2\u20135 \u03bcM [17], peak levels up to 80 \u03bcM could be achieved in the case of a clinical overdose [18].",

Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that chloroquine selectively blocks the above-mentioned potassium channels through structurally specific interactions. Regarding the hERG channel blockade, alanine-scanning mutagenesis and molecular docking studies indicated that chloroquine mainly interacts through specific cation-\u03c0 and \u03c0-stacking interactions with Tyr-652 and Phe-656 of the proteic subunits lining the pore through a \u201cfoot in the door\u201d type mechanism [22]. A third possible point of interaction would be offered by Ser-649 [23]. Thus, a three-point interaction binding might be envisaged and it may be anticipated that chloroquine off-target activity on cardiac functioning could display stereoselectivity. This means that one of the enantiomers could be less active as a hERG blocker and, consequently, safer to humans.",
