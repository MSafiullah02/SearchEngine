This suggests that the pathophysiology of SJS/TEN is highly complex and still poorly understood. A patient's predisposition to SJS/TEN is likely multifactorial and an interplay between genetics, the immune system, and environment. An underlying disease process or medication exposure needed to trigger the eruption may not be universal. Idiopathic SJS/TEN is therefore a particular challenge, as the clinical picture alone must guide the clinician toward the most appropriate management, one which optimizes the child's outcome and reduces mortality.",
