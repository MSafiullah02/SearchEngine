As pathogen\u2010reduction occurrs after different steps of precipitation and filtration in the fractionation process, proteins isolated later in the schematic were generally safer from infectious agents [9]. The albumin and globulin fractions proved extremely safe, particularly regarding transmission of hepatitis viruses and HIV. However, the process was not infallible and deviations from proper processing have resulted in disease transmission. Some of the most important plasma protein derivatives such as factors VIII and IX are separated early in the fractionation process and do not reap the benefits of added layers of fractionation and processing.",

Other proteins, especially clotting factors, denature during the pasteurization process unless additional stabilizers are added. Terminal heat inactivation of lyophilized clotting factors has brought varied results depending upon temperature and processing time. Dry heat treatment of lyophilized clotting factors at 60\u201368\u00b0C does not prevent transmission of HBV, HCV and HIV. Increasing the dry heat temperature to 80\u00b0C for 72 h destroys HIV, HBV and HCV, although the non\u2010enveloped viruses, especially HAV and human Parvo B19, may not be completely inactivated. Adding humidity (vapor heating) improves viral kill. Heat inactivation at 100\u00b0C for as little as 1 h has resulted in viral inactivation of both lipid enveloped and non\u2010enveloped viruses. When this process is applied to intravenous immunoglobulin concentrates, little protein is lost. Exposure to low pH inactivates many enveloped viruses, however among commercial proteins, only the immunoglobulins are stable under the necessary acid conditions (pH 4\u00b70).",

The solvent and detergent combination disrupts the lipid envelope and prevents the virus from binding to cells and replicating. Incorporation of a virucidal detergent and solvent (solvent 1% tri\u2010n\u2010butyl phosphate and the detergent 1% Triton\u2010X\u2010100 for 4 h at 30\u00b0C) into the processing of plasma from pools of approximately 12 000 donors produces a product known as solvent\u2010detergent plasma [12]. The tri\u2010n\u2010butyl phosphate is removed by oil extraction, and Triton\u2010X\u2010100 is removed by chromatographic adsorption. Plasma protein concentrates have been made from solvent\u2010detergent\u2010treated plasma, and fresh\u2010frozen plasma (FFP) equivalent has been licensed in the USA and Europe. As with the heat\u2010inactivated coagulation factors, solvent\u2010detergent technology does not inactivate the non\u2010enveloped viruses. Solvent\u2010detergent treatment also results in some loss of integral plasma proteins such as \u03b1\u20102 antiplasmin and protein S [12, 13]. Alpha\u20102 antiplasmin is crucial in maintaining haemostasis especially in patients with liver dysfunction. Decreased levels of the natural anticoagulant protein S can lead to a hypercoaguable state especially when massive solvent\u2010detergent plasma transfusions are used as in massive traumas or therapeutic plasma exchanges. These concerns, along with economic factors, resulted in the removal of solvent\u2010detergent plasma from the US market. Solvent\u2010detergent plasma is still used widely in Europe. Recently, two new solvent\u2010detergent treatment procedures have been developed for single unit or mini\u2010pools of 10\u201312 units of plasma that yield > 90% mean recovery of coagulation factors, anticoagulants (including Protein S), protease inhibitors (including \u03b1\u20102 antiplasmin), total protein, albumin and immunoglobulins. Single unit and mini\u2010pool solvent\u2010detergent treatment technologies show promise and have the potential to overcome some of the drawbacks of the original industrial solvent\u2010detergent treatment processes [14].",

MB has an affinity for nucleic acids and the surfaces of viruses [16]. When MB\u2010treated plasma is exposed to ultraviolet light, most enveloped viruses are easily inactivated; however non\u2010enveloped viruses are more resistant. Intracellular viruses are not inactivated by MB/ultraviolet light, but freezing and thawing plasma often disrupts the cell membranes of leucocytes, thus liberating the viral particles and leaving them susceptible to MB pathogen\u2010inactivation. Residual intact white blood cells containing viruses are removed by a micropore filter. Neither protozoa nor bacteria are inactivated by MB treatment. Plasma proteins are moderately affected; fibrinogen and FVIII activity is reduced by up to 30%[17]. MB treatment can be used for pathogen\u2010inactivation of single units of plasma, thus eliminating the risk of large plasma pools currently used to manufacture solvent\u2010detergent plasma. MacoPharma uses an in\u2010line system consisting of a membrane filter, MB dye, illumination bag, elimination filter and storage bag. The 0\u00b765 \u00b5M membrane filter removes platelets, leucocytes and debris. The plasma then passes through tubing containing an MB pill that dissolves as the plasma flows through the tubing into the illumination bag. The MB\u2010containing plasma is subjected to double\u2010sided illumination by sodium high\u2010intensity low\u2010pressure lamps emitting yellow light at a wavelength of 590 nm for 15\u201320 min. Plasma is then passed through an MB elimination filter that removes greater than 95% of the residual dye and photoderivative by\u2010products [18]. Millions of MB single unit of plasma have been transfused in Europe without unexpected adverse outcomes.",

Upon illumination with ultraviolet A (320\u2013400 nm), the psoralens react with the DNA or RNA pyrimidine bases to form covalently bonded intranucleic and internucleic acid cross\u2010links. This cross\u2010linking prevents replication and transcription of the RNA or DNA [19]. Psoralen treatment with ultraviolet A light results in the reduction of a broad array of viruses, bacteria and protozoa to a level unlikely to transmit infection. Aminomethyl\u2010trimethyl psoralen, a three\u2010ringed synthetic psoralen known as amotosalen hydrochloride or S\u201059, has been extensively tested in the pathogen\u2010reduction of platelets and plasma. Amotosalen and photochemical treatment have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile through extensive toxicological studies for acute toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, phototoxicity, and mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. In order to pathogen\u2010inactivate with psoralens, the platelet concentrate must be volume reduced and re\u2010suspended in 30\u201345% plasma and 70\u201355% platelet additive solution. The amotosalen is added to the platelet and incubated for 3\u20135 min [20]. The product is then exposed to ultraviolet A light after which approximately 80% of the psoralen have been photodegraded to by\u2010products.

The incidence of World Health Organization grade 2 bleeding between the groups was comparable, and the incidence between the groups of World Health Organization grade 3 or 4 bleeding was equivalent. Patients receiving the INTERCEPT platelets had lower post\u2010transfusion platelet count increments, required more platelet transfusions and had a shorter interval between transfusions. Explanations for the differences in post\u2010transfusion platelet count increments in the photochemical\u2010treated (PCT) platelets were partly explained by the lower mean platelet dose and disproportionate number of transfusions containing platelet doses less that 3\u00b70 \u00d7 1011 cells. Transfusion reactions were fewer with PCT platelets most likely attributed to the reduced volume of plasma in the PCT units as well as increased leucocyte inactivation resulting in less cytokine production during storage [21]. However a trend towards a higher frequency of respiratory complications has been noted and is of great concern to the US Food and Drug Administration, but apparently less so for other national regulatory bodies.",

Factor VIII levels, while decreased to 73%, are still sufficient for therapeutic use. There were no significant differences in the quantity and activity of the von Willebrand factor, the pattern and distribution of the von Willebrand multimers, or the activity of the ADAMTS\u201013. Fibrinogen maintained functional activity of approximately 87%. Protein C and S as well as antithrombin were maintained at > 95% pre\u2010treatment activity levels. There was no evidence of coagulation factor activation as a result of treatment. The factor VII kinetics of post\u2010transfusion PCT plasma was compared to standard FFP in a crossover study [23]. In a study of 34 patients with congenital coagulation factor deficiencies, coagulation factor kinetics and therapeutic efficacy of FFP treated with amotosalen and ultraviolet A light has been shown to be consistent with that of conventional FFP [24]. Randomized controlled trials of PCT\u2010FFP supported haemostasis for the treatment of acquired co\u2010agulopathy of liver disease and liver transplantation have revealed outcomes similar to that of conventional FFP [25]. Additional studies utilizing PCT\u2010FFP for plasma exchanges in thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura demonstrated similar results as those with conventional plasma.

The viral reduction of platelets was sufficient to close the window period of transmission of HIV and chronic phase of Parvo B19, eliminate the viraemic period of west Nile virus, prevent infection due to Staphylcoccus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, and result in a 5\u20136 log reduction of Leishmania donovani infantum [27].
