            "text": "Membrane curvature in phospholipid bilayers can be altered through their fatty acids compositions. Specifically, the nature of fatty acids have been shown to affect the packing of phospholipid fatty-acyl chains, inducing either positive or negative curvature, depending on the structure and size of the lipid and fatty acid head group1213. For example, oleic acid (OA) augments membrane fluidity in physiologically relevant phospholipid membrane bilayers and also enables negative curvature14. As such, we examined the effects of oleic acid and its involvement in HCV-induced negatively curved membranes. A key enzyme in the biosynthesis of oleic acid is stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)15. In humans, SCD-1 is highly expressed in the liver, while the other isoform, SCD-5 is primarily expressed in the brain and pancreas1516. SCD introduces a cis double bond in a highly specific manner at the \u03949 position of long-chain acyl-CoAs, with greater selectivity for palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA15. The monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) products of SCD-1 enzymatic activity are shuttled as substrates for the synthesis of membrane phospholipid fatty-acyl chains, triglyceride biogenesis, and cholesterol esterification (Fig. 1)121718. A variety of small molecule inhibitors have been used to show that inhibiting lipogenesis negatively affects HCV replication19. To determine whether HCV replication is dependent on SCD-1 activity, we treated human hepatoma cells (Huh7) stably expressing an HCV replicon with the SCD-1 inhibitor A20 (Fig. 2). Dose dependent reduction of viral RNA replication was observed following 96 hr treatments with inhibitor A (EC50 = 62 nM, Fig. 2c). No toxicity was observed at all concentrations tested (Supplementary Fig. S1). A panel of other previously characterized SCD-1 inhibitors, representing distinct structural classes2021222324, were also tested against genotype 1a and 1b HCV replicons, with EC50 values for inhibition of viral replication measured as low as 0.74 nM (Supplementary Table S1). Inhibition by the SCD-1 inhibitors compared well with the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) inhibitor B25 that inhibits HCV NS3 protease with an EC50 value of 8.3 nM (Fig. 2e). In some cases SCD-1 inhibitors (Supplementary Table S1) blocked HCV replication to a low level but did not abolish all replication as seen in DAA treatments, indicating a different mechanism of action for the SCD-1 inhibitors as demonstrated by a lack of inhibitory effect on in vitro NS3 protease and NS5B polymerase activity (Supplementary Table S2). Similar levels of inhibition of HCV replication and virus production were observed in a full-length genotype 2a (JFH-1T)26 model (Fig. 3). These results suggest that SCD-1 activity is highly advantageous for HCV replication and pharmacological inhibition of SCD-1 leads to an antiviral effect similar to DAAs.",

We observed strong correlation between HCV inhibition and SCD-1 inhibition within these cells suggesting that the antiviral properties of our SCD inhibitors are due to on-target inhibition of the SCD-1 enzyme (Fig. 4). The specificity was further demonstrated by the ability of OA addition to rescue the antiviral effects of the SCD inhibitors (Supplementary Table S1). Finally, SCD inhibitors had no observed effect on HIV replication/spread in a cellular assay. Taken together, these data suggest that inhibitor A acts to block HCV replication by reducing OA levels and that this effect is specific for HCV.",

Because MUFAs such as OA are highly incorporated into triglycerides, it is conceivable that there would be a reduction in storage of these neutral lipids in LDs upon SCD-1 inhibition15. Thus, we treated Huh7 cells, with and without a HCV subgenomic replicon, with the SCD-1 inhibitor A at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 1 \u03bcM. We then performed cellular imaging using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, a label-free method for LD detection2829 and voxel analysis, which quantifies lipid volumes from the threshold CARS signal specific for LDs30. We detected a small change in LD density when Huh7 cells stably expressing an HCV subgenomic replicon were treated with concentrations well above the EC50 value for inhibitor A (Fig. 5). The LD size and cellular distribution did not change in cells treated with inhibitor A below 250 nM. This indicates that there is no appreciable reduction in LD size or density at concentrations of SCD-1 inhibitor that can cause inhibition of HCV replication. At concentrations above 250 nM, we observed a significant reduction in cellular lipid content. Our observations were specific for SCD-1 inhibitor A20 as treatment with inhibitor B25, which targets the NS3 protease, produced no discernible changes in LDs across all concentrations of inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S3).",

Specifically, we postulated that the pharmacological blockade of SCD-1 would alter membrane composition, fluidity and/or the curvature required for functional HCV replication complexes. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the cellular localization of double-stranded (ds) HCV RNA, a species normally localized to intact replication complexes, upon treatment with varying concentrations of SCD inhibitor A (Fig. 6). Using an antibody specific for dsRNA30 and Huh7 cells stably transfected with HCV replicons, confocal microscopy revealed that in untreated cells, ds-HCV RNA exhibits a punctate staining pattern within the cytoplasmic space of the cell (Fig. 6a). Under mock treatment, a similar punctate pattern was also observed, as expected (Fig. 6b). However, upon addition of 100 nM of SCD-1 inhibitor A, we detected a diffuse dispersion pattern of ds-HCV RNA intermediates that are consistent with a significant change in localization (Fig. 6c). We reasoned that the exclusion of ds-HCV RNA from HCV-modified membranes caused the down-regulation of HCV replication since the RNA is no longer protected from endogenous nucleases and is likely no longer associated with host and viral proteins that mediate replication, as previously reported30. This is consistent with SCD inhibitor A affecting HCV modified membranes.",

These membranes are characterized by their detergent and nuclease resistant properties93132.

            "text": "To examine this possibility, we performed an in situ RNAse protection assay (RPA) based on a previously published methodology931. Miyanari et al. showed previously that HCV RNA in replication complexes remains intact in the presence of a membrane permeabilizing detergent (digitonin) and exogenous nucleases931. However, upon disruption of the ER membrane integrity using an additional non-ionic detergent (NP-40), HCV RNA became susceptible to nuclease-mediated degradation. We sought to investigate whether inhibitor A exerts a similar effect on the structural integrity of HCV altered membranes as NP-40, by inhibiting SCD-1 and lowering oleate levels. This is consistent also with the ability of oleic acid to rescue the effect (Supplementary Table S1). We performed comparative PCR for HCV RNA levels followed by densitometry to quantify the magnitudes of HCV RNA degradation after probing for nuclease accessibility to HCV RNA (Fig. 7, and Supplementary Fig. S4). The RPA was performed during mock (Fig. 7a,b lanes 1\u20136) and SCD-1 inhibitor A (Fig. 7a,b lanes 7\u201311) treatments to examine the influence of SCD-1 on the nuclease and detergent resistant properties of viral RNA at replication complexes. Cells were treated at a concentration yielding ~50% reduction of HCV RNA by PCR (n = 5) (Fig. 7b,c and Supplementary Fig. S4). This was performed to ensure that we would be able to observe additional reduction of HCV RNA levels by endogenous and exogenously added nucleases. 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs are susceptible to degradation by cytoplasmic nucleases, and their degradation is a positive control for both cell membrane permeabilization and nuclease activity (Fig. 7a,b). As expected, in treatments containing both nuclease and digitonin, 28S and 18S rRNA are readily degraded (Fig. 7a,b, lanes 3 and 9), whereas HCV RNA is not. In the absence of digitonin, the exogenous nuclease fails to enter the cytoplasm, and as expected, no degradation is observed (Fig. 7a,b, lane 6). Additionally, when NP-40 was added in the absence of nuclease and digitonin, ribosomal RNAs remained intact (Fig. 7a,b, lanes 4 and 10). SCD-1 inhibition alone has no effect on the integrity of ribosomal RNA bands (Fig. 7a,b, lane 7). Interestingly, we observed that for digitonin and nuclease treated cells, inhibitor A (Fig. 7a,b, lane 9) reduced HCV RNA levels similar to the effects of NP-40 (Fig. 7a,b, lane 5). This suggests that the SCD-1 inhibitor disrupts the structural integrity of HCV modified membranes to a similar extent to that of NP-40, which allows exogenous nucleases access to HCV RNA. For inhibitor A as well as digitonin plus nucleases treated cells, the HCV RNA levels showed above 50% reduction in HCV RNA levels (See Fig. 7a,b, lane 8 vs 9). This further supports the notion that SCD-1 inhibitor treated HCV replicon containing cells are more susceptible to nucleases where SCD-1 inhibitor-induced membrane perturbation allows nuclease access into the replication complexes to degrade HCV RNA to a greater extent than mock treated cells. After repeating the exogenous nuclease protection assay (n = 5), we observed that HCV RNA levels in digitonin, nuclease, and inhibitor A treated HCV replicon containing cells showed no statistically significant difference in comparison to digitonin, nuclease, and NP-40 treatment, which further confirms that the effects of inhibitor A mimic NP-40 treatment in disrupting the protective environment of the membranous webs (Fig. 7c). As expected, no significant degradation of HCV RNA was observed in cells treated with digitonin only (Fig. 7a,b, lane 1), NP-40 only (Fig. 7a,b, lane 4), and nuclease only (Fig. 7a,b, lane 6), in both mock and SCD-1 inhibitor A (Fig. 7a,b, lanes 8 and 10) treated groups. Ultimately, the RPA demonstrates that reduced oleate from SCD-1 inhibitor treatment caused a change in the nuclease resistant HCV replication complexes, which then become accessible to endogenous or exogenously added nucleases.",

However, our current understanding of the biogenesis of HCV-associated membranous webs is limited. While it is well established that HCV hijacks host lipid homeostasis to facilitate its pathogenesis193536, there is an emerging body of evidence that these lipid pathways play an important role in HCV's formation of membranous replication complexes. This includes the modulation of phosphoinositide signaling and cholesterol synthesis to induce the formation of the HCV replication compartments237. Previous work analyzing the role of fatty acid biosynthesis in HCV pathogenesis has had a central focus on its relevance in HCV-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Our study demonstrates an important role for unsaturated fatty acids in the formation of HCV-induced membranous compartments.",

This HCV-induced increase in cellular fatty acid levels may serve as a source of unsaturated fatty acids for formation of the viral replication complex. Our proposed pro-viral role of SCD-1 is consistent with recent studies demonstrating HCV activates SCD expression and activity384344.

We have shown that inhibiting SCD-1 decreases HCV RNA replication, through compromising the integrity of the membrane environment at replication complexes. Also, we demonstrated that SCD-1 inhibition increases the susceptibility of HCV RNA to exogenous nucleases in permeabilized cells suggesting that SCD-1 inhibition disrupts oleic acid-induced negative membrane curvature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence of unsaturated fatty acids playing a role in the formation of HCV replication complexes.
