Anosmia and ageusia have received much attention, but are ubiquitous in other common upper respiratory tract infections. While a reported increased risk of cerebrovascular disease [4] was replicated in a further preprint [5], the incidence was similar to that in critical illness more broadly [6].

Recent correspondence provides a secondary (Chinese language) citation of CSF positivity for SARS-CoV- 2 [9], but no clinical or laboratory details were provided, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are at risk of sample contamination from shed airborne virus. A concerted effort by the international Human Cell Atlas community (yet to be published, but presented online at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHqBoU4s63U&feature=youtu.be) has documented the relative expression of the two key co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, ACE2, and TMPRSS2, across multiple tissues, and highlights that (in health) there is minimal expression in brain tissue, suggesting that direct brain infection would not be a common phenomenon. The one brain cell type which did express both genes was the oligodendrocyte, and therefore, SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis might be expected to be a predominantly white-matter disease where it does occur.",

It is reassuring that, despite the peak onset of para-infectious conditions typically occurring within 4 weeks, there has been no clear signal from countries affected early in the pandemic course.

Although recent reports suggest some benefit in the most severe cases of COVID-19-related ARDS [10], evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks suggests that viral shedding may be prolonged in patients treated with corticosteroids [11], and their routine use is currently avoided. Typical second-line treatments for neuroinflammatory crises, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) or plasma exchange (PLEX), are less likely to delay viral clearance in COVID-19, and given some reports of benefit in sepsis [12, 13], they may even be of potential benefit. However, IVIg is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism [14], a particular issue given the reports of increased D-dimer levels [10] and (as yet unquantified) concerns regarding the risk of microthrombosis in COVID-19 infections.",

The collection of such pragmatic data should be feasible in a global pandemic, with incorporation into wider pandemic research efforts, which currently collect some limited neurological data [18]. They could also provide a basis for retrospective clinical record review in cohorts of patients affected earlier in the pandemic, looking for neurological associations with COVID-19 infection. More specialized units could seek to collect more detailed basic CDEs, which require more effort and pose a greater regulatory burden. Finally, supplemental CDEs (e.g., neuroimaging, biospecimens, and postmortem brain examination) would only be collected by centers that had appropriate resources. One key (but organizationally demanding) supplemental CDE would be the long-term follow-up of survivors of the COVID-19 pandemic, to allow effective monitoring of late neurological sequelae.",
