ARBs directly protect the lung from the severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of viral infections, including those from coronavirus. The protective effect of ACE2 is enhanced by ARB administration. For these reasons ARB therapy must be continued for patients affected by hypertension, diabetes and renal disease, comorbidities of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine whether ARBs may be included as additional therapy for COVID-19 patients.",

The authors hypothesize that increased expression of the receptor would enhance viral uptake.

However, the speculation that such treatment enhances infection with this virus [1] is without scientific evidence.
