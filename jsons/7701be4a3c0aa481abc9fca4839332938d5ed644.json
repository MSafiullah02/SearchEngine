Indications are that the exodus resulted from a convergence of several independent economic forces: the looming uncertainty of the Affordable Care Act on the prevailing radiology business model, the effect of successive cuts to Medicare imaging revenue, and the impact of the recession on the radiology job market [3, 4] .

The simple answer is that student interest in DR is driven, in part, by the strength of the radiology job market [6] . In recent years, students have been so attracted to DR during periods of economic prosperity that it now has the dubious distinction of being the \"number one backup specialty in the match\". This behavior helps explain the extreme volatility of radiology recruitment with respect to the economy -why residency positions can be quite competitive when the job market is strong yet quickly become difficult to fill when it tightens. A better understanding of these student behaviors might help us predict and even mitigate future declines in recruitment related to economic uncertainty.",

The truth is that marketing and recruitment for our specialty has always been somewhat challenging, mostly because of radiology's absence in the required medical school curriculum. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, only 16% of medical schools required a dedicated radiology clerkship in the 2018-2019 academic year [7] . Without broad access to students, our specialty has been relegated to the sidelines while others have controlled our narrative, primarily medical students and physicians from other specialties [8] . This has allowed misconceptions to run rampant for decades, including for example, that radiology is a specialty occurring far from patient care areas, that it offers trainees little opportunity for social interaction, and that it is a specialty better suited for men.",

One study revealed that the top three attitudes medical students associate with radiology are \"regular hours, excellent salary, and lots of free time\" [9] . Perception of these lifestyle metrics, coupled with the presence of a strong radiology job market, make DR popular as a backup choice for many students, especially those vying for the truly competitive specialties in the match.",

It includes students who fail to match into competitive specialties and are faced with scrambling into unfilled radiology positions. It also includes countless surgical interns and residents looking to leave their programs and transfer into DR, their stories all quite familiar to PDs. Indeed, radiology program directors receive unsolicited emails nearly every week from clinical residents looking to leave their programs. To be clear, DR is the beneficiary of these talented trainees, but we must dig deeper to understand why such a substantial fraction of our most competitive applicants consider radiology only as their second career choice.",

In an attempt to avoid a catastrophic number of unmatched students in the first year of the integrated IR match (2016-2017), the leadership of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology made an eleventh-hour recommendation that applicants also apply to DR programs at institutions hosting IR residencies, as they could provide alternate pathways to IR [10] . While the solution was meant as a stop-gap measure to prevent disaster during the first IR recruitment season, it has become the default strategy for subsequent classes of students applying to integrated IR, as expansion of IR positions in the match has been too slow to accommodate student interest. This represents a large and relatively new subset of students using radiology as their \"plan B\" -applying to DR but preferring another specialty on their rank lists.",

Additionally, DR consistently has among the highest \"average number of ranked applicants required to fill its positions\" in the match. As explained in the NRMP data report, this metric is a rough measure of specialty competitiveness, with larger numbers indicating less competitive specialties [11] .
