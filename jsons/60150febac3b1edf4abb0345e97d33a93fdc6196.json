There are 81 currently no effective treatment or prevention options and it has become a global health problem 82 with more than 3.1 million cases and over 217,000 deaths as of 29 th April 2020 [1] . Urgent strategies 83 are required to manage the pandemic and the repurposing of already approved medicines is likely to 84 bring options forward more quickly than full development of potent and specific antivirals. Antiviral 85 drugs may have application prior to or during early infection, but may be secondary to 86 immunological interventions in later stages of severe disease [2] . repurposing exist, including the use of the anti-angiogenic drug thalidomide for cancer and the use 93 of mifepristone for Cushing's disease after initially being approved for termination of early 94 pregnancy [5, 6] . 95 96 SARS-CoV-2 targets the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that are present in high 97 density on the outer surface of lung cells. Lungs are the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and 98 infection is usually initiated in the upper respiratory tract [7] . Symptoms that result in neurological, 99 renal and hepatic dysfunction are also emerging due to the expression of ACE2 receptors in these 100 organs [8] [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, therapeutic concentrations of antiviral drugs are likely to be needed in the 101 upper airways for treatment and prevention of infection, but sufficient concentrations are also likely 102 to be required systemically for therapy to target the virus in other organs and tissues. 103",

The authors recently reported a holistic analysis which 106 benchmarked reported in vitro activity of tested drugs against previously published pharmacokinetic 107 exposures achievable with their licenced doses [13] . Importantly, this analysis demonstrated that the 108 majority of drugs that have been studied for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity are unlikely to achieve the 109 necessary concentrations in the plasma after administration of their approved doses. While this 110 analysis is highly influenced by the drugs selected for analysis to date and highly sensitive to the 111 accuracy of the reported antiviral activity data, a number of candidate agents were identified with 112 plasma exposures above the reported EC50/EC90 against SARS-CoV-2. 113 114 One such drug, nitazoxanide, is a thiazolide antiparasitic medicine used for the treatment of 115 cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis that cause diarrhoea [14, 15] , and also has reported activity against 116 anaerobic bacteria, protozoa and other viruses [16] . Importantly, rapid deacetylation of nitazoxanide 117 in blood means that the major systemic species of the drug in vivo is tizoxanide, which has not yet 118 been studied for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Notwithstanding, tizoxanide has been shown to exhibit 119 similar in vitro inhibitory activity to nitazoxanide for rotaviruses [17], hepatitis B and C viruses [18, 120 19 Model development 160 One hundred virtual healthy adults (50% women, aged 20-60 years between 40-120 kg) were 161 simulated. Patient demographics such as weight, BMI and height were obtained from CDC charts 162 [37] . Organ weight/volumes and blood flow rates in humans were obtained from published 163 literature sources [38, 39] . Transit from the stomach and small intestine was divided into seven 164 compartments to capture effective absorption kinetics as previously described [40] . Tissue to plasma 165 partition ratio of drug and drug disposition across various tissues and organs were described using 166 published mathematical equations [41] [42] [43] . Effective permeability (Peff) in humans was scaled from 167 apparent permeability (Papp) in HT29-19A cells (due to lack of available data, it was assumed the 168 same in Caco-2 cells) using the following equations to compute the rate of absorption (Ka in h -1 ) from 169 the small intestine.

The present study aimed to 296 define the optimal doses and schedules for maintaining tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations 297 above the reported nitazoxanide EC90 for the duration of the dosing interval. [55] was calculated to be 8.4 mg/L, which is higher than the one reported EC90 for nitazoxanide 306 against SARS-CoV-2 [50]. The PBPK model was used to simulate plasma and lung exposures after 307 administration of 600 mg BID for 5 days, and while only plasma Cmax exceeded the average influenza 308 EC90 in the majority of patients, the Ctrough values did not. The modelling data suggest that the 309 moderate effects of nitazoxanide seen in influenza could be a function of under dosing. Taken 310 collectively, these data are encouraging for the application of nitazoxanide in COVID-19, assuming 311 that tizoxanide displays anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity comparable to that reported for nitazoxanide. 312",

The PBPK model simulations indicate a high BID dose of 1400 mg (fed) 323 and caution may be needed for gastrointestinal intolerance at this dose. The simulations indicate 324 that lower TID and QID dosing regimens may also warrant investigation, and 900 mg TID as well as 325 700 mg QID (both with food) regimen are also predicted to provide optimal exposures for efficacy. 326 Importantly, the overall daily dose was estimated to be comparable between the different optimal 327 schedules and it is unclear whether splitting the dose will provide gastrointestinal benefits. For 328 prevention application where individuals will need to adhere to regimens for longer durations, 329 minimising the frequency of dosing is likely to provide adherence benefits. However, for short term 330 application in therapy, more frequent dosing may be more acceptable to minimise gastrointestinal 331 intolerance. 332 333 Nitazoxanide mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown. However, for influenza it 334 has been reported to involve interference with N-glycosylation of hemagglutinin [22, 55, 56] .

However, there are some important limitations that must be considered. PBPK models 342 can be useful in dose prediction but the quality of predictions is only as good as the quality of the 343 available data on which they are based. Furthermore, the mechanism of action for nitazoxanide for 344 other viruses has also been postulated to involve an indirect mechanism through amplification of the 345 host innate immune response [59] , and this would not have been captured in the in vitro antiviral 346 activity that informed the target concentrations for this dose prediction.

Nitazoxanide absorption was 179 considered using the available apparent permeability data (shown in table 1) and tizoxanide was 180assumed to form as soon as the drug reached systemic circulation as metabolic studies have shown 181 it takes just six minutes for complete conversion into the active circulating metabolite, with no trace 182 of nitazoxanide detected in plasma [47]. Therefore, tizoxanide parameters were used to define drug 183 disposition. The model was assumed to be validated if: 1) the absolute average fold error (AAFE) 184 between the observed and the simulated plasma concentrations -time curve of tizoxanide was less 185 than two; and 2) the simulated pharmacokinetic parameters -maximum concentration (Cmax), area 186 under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and Ctrough (trough concentration at the end of the 187 dosing interval) were less than two-fold from the mean observed values. following administration of 600 mg BID as reported in a previous phase 2b/3 191 clinical trial of nitazoxanide in uncomplicated influenza [24] were first simulated and plotted relative 192 to the average of previously reported influenza EC90s [48, 49] for strains(as shown in supplementary 193 table 1) included in the previous trials. This was done to assess the exposure relative to in vitro 194 activity for an indication where clinical benefit was already demonstrated. 195 196 For potential SARS-CoV-2 applications, several oral dosing regimens were simulated for BID, TID or 197 QID administration in the fasted state.

As another respiratory 121 virus, previous work on influenza may be useful to gain insight into the expected impact of 122 nitazoxanide for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the drug has been shown to selectively block the 123 maturation of the influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein at the post-translational stage[22, 23]  and a 124 previous phase 2b/3 trial demonstrated a reduction in symptoms and viral shedding at a dose of 600 125 mg BID compared to placebo in patients with uncomplicated influenza [24]. Other potential benefits 126 of nitazoxanide in COVID-19 may derive from its impact upon the innate immune response that 127 potentiates the production of type 1 interferons [25, 26] and bronchodilation of the airways through 128 inhibition of TMEM16A ion channels [27]. A clinical trial (NCT04341493) started on April 6 th 2020 and 129 aims to evaluate the activity of 500 mg BID nitazoxanide alone or in combination with the 4-130 aminoquinoline hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 [28]. However, there are currently no data 131 within the public domain to support this dose selection for COVID-19. Nitazoxanide is relatively safe 132 in humans and studies showed tolerability of single oral doses up to 4 g with minimal 133 gastrointestinal side effects. Plasma concentrations of tizoxanide have demonstrated dose 134proportionality, but administration in the fed state increases the plasma exposure[29]. Thus, the 135 drug is recommended for administration with food. 136Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling is a computational tool that integrates 138 human physiology and drug disposition kinetics using mathematical equations to inform the 139 pharmacokinetic exposure using in vitro and drug physicochemical data[30]. The aim of this study 140 was to validate a PBPK model for tizoxanide following administration of nitazoxanide. Once validated 141 this model was first used to assess the plasma and lung exposures estimated to be achieved during a 142 previous trial for uncomplicated influenza. Next, different nitazoxanide doses and schedules were 143 simulated to identify those expected to provide tizoxanide plasma and lung trough concentrations 144 (Ctrough) above the reported nitazoxanide SARS-CoV-2 EC90 in the majority (>90%) of patients. 145A whole-body PBPK model consisting of compartments to represent select organs and tissues was 148 developed. Nitazoxanide physiochemical and drug-specific parameters used in the PBPK model were 149 obtained from literature sources as outlined inTable 1. The PBPK model was assumed to be blood-150 flow limited, with instant and uniform distribution in each tissue or organ and no reabsorption from 151 the large intestine.
