Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is being increasingly recognized and may indicate a poor outcome [2]. While patients with COVID-19 can develop acute coronary syndrome, ST segment elevation on electrocardiogram (ECG) has been mainly described in patients with COVID-19-related acute myocarditis and severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [2\u20135]. We describe two cases of transient ST segment elevation in patients with preserved LVEF. Our goal is to raise awareness of this aspect of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 and prevent unnecessary catheterization.",
