The containment measures for this disease such as the requirement of health care facilities greatly rely on estimating the future dynamics and flattening of the COVID-19 curve. However, it is always challenging to estimate the future trends and flattening of the COVID-19 curve due to the involvement of many real-life variables. Recently, traditional methods based on SIR and SEIR have been presented for predictive monitoring and detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve. In this paper, a novel method for detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve and its ending life-cycle using only the time-series of new cases per day is presented. Simulation results are compared to the SIR based methods in three different scenarios using COVID-19 curves for South Korea, the United States of America, and India. In this study, simulations, performed on the 26 th April 2020 show that the peak of the COVID-19 curve in the USA has already arrived and situated on the 14 th of April 2020, while the peak of the COVID-19",

            "text": "The common characteristic of the COVID-19 spread across the nations is that there is an increase in the new cases per day initially, then flattens and comes to an end after following almost an exponential trend. The graphical representation of new cases per day is known as the COVID-19 curve. At this stage, everyone wants to know when the curve will flatten, and when this will end. This is important to note that the prolonged flattening of the curve may not only put an extra burden on the healthcare system but also to the economic activities of a nation. Thus, it is always a challenge for those who are involved in policy interventions and assessing health care requirements to estimate the present trends and the possibility of flattening of the COVID-19 curve shortly. This assessment ultimately helps to make suitable decisions in the future. Traditionally, estimation of epidemiological disease dynamics is carried out using susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-infected-exposed-recovered (SIER) based models. Recently, an effort has been made to detect flattening and estimating the ending lifecycle of COVID-19 curves based on the SIR model [6] . However, it is reported that the main disadvantage of SIR based methods is that they require estimates of critical epidemiological parameters [7] .",

For example, the relative peak position abruptly changes on the current day from 5 days to 70 days is not realizable in the near future, however, a change in peak position from 5 to 25 days is realizable. In this manner, using eqn. (1), ending the life-cycle of the curve is also estimated. Here, ending life-cycle means the day when the curve will come to an end. For example, the ending date of 97% life-cycle of the curve is a day when 97% of the total expected cases will be reported.",

A novel method for detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve and estimating its ending life-cycle using only the time-series of new cases per day, grossly fitted to the Gaussian function is proposed. Simulation results using the COVID-19 curve for the South-Korea demonstrate the ability of the method to detect the peak as well as estimating its ending lifecycle. Further, comparisons of the simulations results to the method based on the SIR model for the USA and India, suggest that the proposed method can quantify the varying dynamics of the COVID-19 curve without utilizing critical epidemiological parameters.",
