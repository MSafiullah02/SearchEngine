However, COVID-19 is not considered as direct zoonosis as its transmission now is primarily human to human [6]. The mode of transmission of the virus between humans is via respiratory droplets [7]. However, aerosol spread could be a potential route of transmission as illustrated by a study investigating the aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 [8], where the authors studied the viability of the virion particles on different surfaces including stainless-steel, plastic, cardboard, and copper as well as in aerosol particles (< 5 \u00b5m). It was found that the virus remains viable in aerosol particles for up to 3 hours with a median half-life of 1.2 hours [8]. The virus is more stable on plastic and stainless- steel surfaces than on copper and cardboard. The viability of the virus was found to be up to 3 days on plastic and stainless-steel, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper surfaces [8]. Direct contact is another source of virus transmission via touching the mouth, nose or conjunctiva with contaminated fingers [9].",

Its entry to the lung is facilitated by the binding of S protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors [15], which may be the same as SARS-CoV which also enter cells via ACE2 receptors [16,17]. Moreover, it uses the host Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming and fusion of viral and host cell membranes [6]. ACE2 receptor binding can be shown by two lines of evidence: (1) sequence analysis of the receptor binding motif, which is the part of receptor binding domain that comes into direct contact with ACE2 receptor, which has revealed extensive similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and (2) the blockade of SARS-2-S driven cell entry by using human ACE2 antisera.",

Lung ultrasound may be also useful in the evaluation of critically ill COVID-19 patients [21,22]. The utilisation of CT radiological findings to diagnose/screen for COVID-19 is controversy. An American-Singaporean panel published that CT findings were not part of the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 [19].

            "text": "There are many factors that could explain why SARS-Cov-2 is not primarily a disease with large consequences for paediatric populations. Firstly, it could be explained by the distribution of ACE2 receptors in fetal lung compared to adult lung tissue. Hoffmann et al. in their study inoculated different cell lines with pseudo-particles harbouring SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein then measured the luciferase activity; it was shown that Calu-3 cells (adult human lung adenocarcinoma cells) demonstrated higher luciferase activity 105.5 cps compared to MRC-5 cells (human fetal lung cells) with 102 cps [6]. This finding infers that foetal lung ACE2 receptors have different characteristics than mature lung tissue (e.g. lower binding capacity). Secondly, the children are exposed to other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza A and Influenza B viruses, which enhance their serum antibody levels and could provide cross protection [4]. Children\u2019s immune system is not fully mature and they respond to infections in a manner different from adult\u2019s response. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the actual number of COVID-19 in children may be higher than the published figures. Nonetheless, due to the mild symptoms or even asymptomatic cases, it may be underdiagnosed. Widening the screening scale may pick up larger number of childhood cases.",

The affected children can also present with gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal distension - [35]. The disease has good prognosis in children with most of the cases are recovered after a mild disease course and it is very uncommon to progress to severs lower respiratory disease [38]. Data from adult patients showed that they can develop difficulty breathing one week after the initial symptoms which can progress to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy [7]. However, this trajectory is extremely rare in children [38]. Sun et al. [34] described eight critically/severely ill patients who were admitted to the ICU. One patient had underlying immuno-suppression from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia which made him more susceptible to critical COVID19 disease. In this study four patients developed complications in the form of septic shock, multi organ system failure, kidney stones, hydronephrosis, coagulopathy, DIC, intussusception, status epilepticus, and hypoglobulinemia.",

Additionally, Chen et al. [10] examined the amniotic fluid, cord blood and the first breast milk after delivery. All samples tested negative for COVID-19. Other studies investigated the possibility of vertical transmission via vaginal delivery, they found that all tested neonates had negative throat swab [11,25,27]. However, a recently published study [12] investigated the possibility of COVID-19 vertical transmission via screening all neonates (n = 33) born to confirmed COVID-19 mothers, 3 neonates (9%) experienced positive nasopharyngeal and throat swabs of COVID-19, this means that the possibility of vertical transmission cannot be precluded. The limitation of these studies are: 1) the small sample size; 2) maternal infection occurred at the third trimester of pregnancy, so little is known about the possibility of neonatal affection in the first or second trimesters.

This prematurity may be explained by COVID-19 induced hypoxemia or may be attributed to other factors such as the preeclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, history of previous CS or still birth[10,25]. Neonatal death was reported in only one case born to COVID-19 positive mother. This child had thrombocytopenia, impaired coagulation profile and elevated level of transaminases. He developed multiorgan failure and DIC to which he received packed RBCs, platelets and plasma transfusion, but he did not respond to the treatment and eventually died at the age of 9 days. The cause of death is not clear, it may be related to poor neonatal immunity, high maternal viral load or severe maternal clinical picture.",

First, the sample was taken 36 hours after delivery, so the child could be infected by direct contact [27]. Secondly, both cord blood and placenta samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, vertical transmission could not be ruled out completely as the negative screening in the cord blood and placenta can be attributed to low viral load at the time of delivery that was below the detection limit of the PCR. So, further studies are needed.",
