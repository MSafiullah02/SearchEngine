We think those with international flights have a more extensive network, and this will increase the probability of getting infected with an emerging disease that is not endemic inside the country. Besides, more than 25% of Iran's population live in the rural area, and it seems the prevalence of infection among them is highly lower than in large cities (2). Second, it is not clear the source of the infection whether they infected inside of Iran or they were international travelers from other countries. Some passengers, especially Chinese, prefer to use Iran as the connection for their international flights. The spread of the disease from China has been attributed to the level of its communication with other countries. Iran has communication with China in the form of trade and travel, however, the level of transfer between the two countries as well as the number of Iranians and Chinese living in the other country does not seem to be more than those observed in other countries of the region and the world (3).",
