            "text": "Abalone herpes-like virus (AbHV) is a major pathogen that affects the nervous system of abalones (Corbeil et al., 2012b). The pathogen is highly virulent for Haliotis diversicolor, but does not have any apparent effects on other abalone species (Corbeil et al., 2012a). Abalones can be infected at all life-stages and suffer a high mortality rate. Once symptoms occur, the entire pool of abalone can die within three days. Between 1999 and 2003, the yields of cultured abalone in China were severely affected by an epidemic of continuous outbreaks of this fatal disease. In addition to AbHV, the pathogen viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV) can cause severe disease in fish populations. The disease caused by VNNV is known as viral nervous necrosis (VNN) or viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) (Doan et al., 2016, Grotmol et al., 2000, Toubanaki et al., 2015a). It is a major cause of mortality in larvae and juveniles of farmed marine fish, occurring frequently in adult fish in recent years (Chi et al., 2005, Su et al., 2015, Toubanaki et al., 2015a, Toubanaki et al., 2015b). With a high mortality rate (80\u2013100%), the disease can rapidly wipe out a local fish population in a week. Data from fish populations in South Korea, Japan, and China reveal that RGNNV is causing a major epidemic in East and West Asia, with strains specific to each region (Gomez et al., 2008, Gomez et al., 2004, Ma et al., 2015). Over the past decade, RGNNV infection has caused severe losses to seedling production in the large-scale culture of groupers in the coastal regions of China.",

The TaqMan\u00ae PCR assay developed by Corbeil et al. can detect 30 copies of recombinant plasmid DNA per reaction (Corbeil et al., 2010). There are several methods for the detection of NNV, such as enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELLSA) (Arimoto et al., 1992, Huang et al., 2001, Nunez-Ortiz et al., 2016), immuno-fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) (Nguyen et al., 1996), in situ hybridization (Comps et al., 1996), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Gomez et al., 2008, Grotmol et al., 2000, Nishizawa et al., 1995), reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Dalla Valle et al., 2005, Hodneland et al., 2011, Kuo et al., 2011, Mazelet et al., 2011), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) (Mekata et al., 2014, Sung and Lu, 2009, Wang et al., 2011), and molecular beacon (Su et al., 2015). Although these methods have their own advantages, drawbacks such as complex and time-consuming procedures, lower sensitivity, and the requirement of well-trained personnel and precise equipment, severely hinder their application in the field and popularization among farmers.",

The entire reaction is performed between 37 and 39 \u00b0C for 20\u201340 min without the requirement of a heating and cooling system. Therefore, it may be more suitable for field detection than PCR. RPA has been widely used in the life sciences, such as for food testing and clinical diagnosis, as well as in other fields (Babu et al., 2017, Boyle et al., 2014, Hill-Cawthorne et al., 2014, Mekuria et al., 2014, Miles et al., 2015, Murinda et al., 2014, Xia et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2016a, Yang et al., 2016b). Kersting et al. developed RPA chips that can simultaneously amplify and detect three pathogens, including Neisseriagonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Kersting et al., 2014a). Using the chip, the assay can complete detection of these three pathogens, including control plasmids, within 20 min. Abd El Wahed et al. developed a portable RT-RPA device that can identify Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged zoonotic virus, within 3\u20137 min with a detection limit of 10 RNA molecules, making it as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR (Abd El Wahed et al., 2013). Kersting et al. combined the RPA TwistAmp\u00ae nfo probe and primers with a lateral flow dipstick to achieve high sensitivity and rapid detection of the 18S rRNA gene for the parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Kersting et al., 2014b).",

Previous studies have used this method to test 1673 samples from different abalone populations in Victoria and Tasmanias, showing that the sensitivity and specificity are 96.7% and 99.4%, respectively (Corbeil et al., 2010). However, the detection limit in present studies was 1000 copies, causing it to be below the level reported in the literature and also below the AbHV-qRPA assay presented here (100 copies). Furthermore, AbHV-qRPA has an advantage when considering the reaction time and temperature. The entire reaction takes place at 37 \u00b0C, without the need for a complicated heating and cooling system, and results can be obtained within 20 min. This can be compared to the TaqMan\u00ae PCR method which typically takes 1 h. Therefore, the qRPA detection method presented here can greatly improve the screening efficiency of AbHV and enable timely preventive measures.",

The RT-qPCR assay introduced by Kuo et al. can detect as few as 10 copies of the plasmid (Kuo et al., 2011). The same method was attempted in this study, but we were only able to detect 100 copies of the plasmid as the same detection limit as the qRPA method. The RT-qPCR assay takes 40 min to complete, while qRPA yields results within 20 min. For high copy number plasmids, qRPA can obtain results within 10 min, causing it to have a large advantage over conventional PCR methods. Additionally, the detection rate of qRPA was slightly higher than that of qPCR with shorter time using both methods to analyze the same batch of grouper samples. LAMP is another isothermal amplification detection method. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP compared with single-step RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR was described by Sung and Lu (Sung and Lu, 2009); they found that the detection limit of RT-LAMP was approximately 1000-fold and 10-fold higher than that of one-step PCR and nested RT-PCR, respectively (Sung and Lu, 2009). However, LAMP is a qualitative or semi \u2013 quantitative detection method that cannot be accurately quantified. On the contrary, qRPA can perform quantification in the sample, as evidenced by a good correlation between quantification methods (R2\n > 0.85).",

Therefore, we tried to reduce the reaction volume in this study. However, the RPA buffer is so viscous that it is difficult to obtain an admixture of the reaction solution. This may explain why the qRPA repeatability is not as accurate as qPCR. Before preparing the RPA reaction solution, we first configured the upstream and downstream primers, probe, and buffer. Next, we thawed the freeze-dried powder (in TwistAmp kit), and then add MgAc to the fully mixed solution to initiate the reaction. This process is more cumbersome than PCR and LAMP, resulting in increased susceptibility to environmental contamination. Although RPA has the advantage of rapid reaction and low reaction temperature, it still requires more effort to reduce reagent costs and simplify reaction steps in order to play a better role in field detection. Twist Amp\u00ae DNA amplification kits and Twist Amp\u00ae exo Probe are very expensive; the cost of each reaction of 25 \u03bcL is approximately 25 Yuan. In contrast, the price of qPCR assays is comparatively lower than that of qRPA assays; each reaction costs approximately 5 Yuan. If SYBR@Green dye is used, the cost is reduced further.",
