            "text": "Developing risk-based surveillance programmes for animal diseases is essential to support both strategic and operational decision-making in the field of animal and veterinary public health (Reist et al., 2012). Indeed, mobilising resources towards targeted high-risk populations improves the sensitivity and cost-effectiveness of surveillance systems (St\u00e4rk et al., 2006). The sub-populations to be targeted are usually chosen based on epidemiological studies assessing the probability of occurrence of the hazard in the sub-population (e.g. farms with specific risk factors) and/or the consequences of the disease potentially being introduced in this sub-population (e.g. economic effects, spread to other herds or countries) (St\u00e4rk et al., 2006). However, most current pathogen surveillance programmes do not quantitatively include the risk related to animal movements, even though these are a major transmission route between farms. The exposure of farms or areas to pathogens is therefore closely related to the movement network\u2019s features. As such, animal movement data have been increasingly studied using social network analysis (SNA) methods, with farms being considered as nodes, and animal movements between farms as links (Wasserman and Faust, 1994, Bigras-Poulin et al., 2006, Bigras-Poulin et al., 2007, Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2009, Natale et al., 2009, Ribbens et al., 2009, N\u00f6remark et al., 2011, Lindstrom et al., 2012, Rautureau et al., 2012, Buttner et al., 2013, Dorjee et al., 2013, Guinat et al., 2016, Thakur et al., 2016). Although in most studies network analyses have been motivated by the consequences of animal trade on the epidemiology of animal diseases (Keeling, 2005, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005, Bigras-Poulin et al., 2007, Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2009, Rautureau et al., 2012, Buttner et al., 2013), the specific role of animal shipments in pathogen transmission and/or exposure has only scarcely been documented and rarely quantified, especially in the swine sector (Ortiz-Pelaez et al., 2006, Green et al., 2008, Martin et al., 2011, Porphyre et al., 2011, Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012, Nicolas et al., 2013, Beaunee et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2017, Salines et al., 2017b, Sintayehu et al., 2017). Analysing contact patterns related to pig trade could provide new insight into infection dynamics, pathogen spread and risk factors, helping to design risk-based surveillance programmes.",

Indeed, several human hepatitis E cases have been related to the consumption of raw or undercooked products containing pig liver (Colson et al., 2010, Moal et al., 2012, Motte et al., 2012). HEV is highly prevalent in pig farms and is likely to spread between farms through the introduction of infected pigs, especially due to the pyramidal structure of the pig production sector (Salines et al., 2017a). To date, no continuing HEV surveillance programmes have ever been implemented in industrialised countries (Salines et al., 2017a).",

In short, previous data had indicated a farm-level prevalence close to 70% (Rose et al., 2010); the number of herds required to estimate 70% with 10% relative precision and 95% confidence, was 165. This number was increased to 186 to anticipate uncontrolled events. The herds to be sampled were determined by random selection of a list of slaughter dates and times from a database table. The observed minimum within-herd prevalence in this same preliminary study was close to 10% (Rose et al., 2010) and this value was retained as the minimum within-herd target prevalence to be detected. Given the sensitivity and specificity of the commercial serological tests (Rose et al., 2010), this led to sampling of 30 pigs in batches with less than 50 pigs, 40 pigs in batches of 50\u2013100 pigs and 50 pigs in batches with more than 100 pigs. Finally, 6565 sera and 3715 livers were randomly sampled from 186 pig farms located in 49 different French d\u00e9partements, corresponding to between 26 and 42 individual serum samples per farm and between 16 and 20 liver samples per farm collected at the slaughterhouse.

The primary advantage of our study lies in combining epidemiology and network analysis to quantify both the impact of animal movements on pathogen prevalence within farms and the risk of areas being exposed to diseases due to between-area movements. HEV was chosen as a pathogen for implementation. Indeed, pig movements are likely to play a pivotal role in HEV epidemiology (Salines et al., 2017a), although they have only scarcely been explored to date (Nantel-Fortier et al., 2016).

The information provided by this database is recognised by the French Ministry for Agriculture and can therefore be considered trustworthy. Moreover, a thorough cleaning stage was carried out to manage incorrect or incomplete data. The quality of data in terms of accuracy, reliability, and comprehensiveness guaranteed the robustness of our results (Salines et al., 2017b). The random selection process for tested farms and for individual pigs tested from each farm (Rose et al., 2011) ensured reliable estimates for the seroprevalence values used in our study. Moreover, the within-farm apparent seroprevalence estimates were corrected for serological test characteristics, providing true seroprevalence estimates. Eight production sites surveyed in 2009 ceased activity before 2013, limiting movement data availability to only 178 out of the 186 farms. This is consistent with the observed overall decrease in the number of pig farms in France (Salines et al., 2017b). On the d\u00e9partement scale, the model involving the random sampling of farm-level HEV prevalence from beta distributions \u2212 with a weighted confidence interval \u2212 made it possible to take into account the low precision of some prevalence figures in quite a few d\u00e9partements where a low number of farms had been sampled. Temporal variability of both pig movements and HEV seroprevalence was a limitation of our study. Indeed, one should note that movement and prevalence data were not simultaneously collected. However, the French pig movement network has been found to be stable over time (Salines et al., 2017b), so we can assume that combining the 2009 prevalence data with the 2013 pig movement data is still consistent. Moreover, 70% of the 178 farms included in our study showed a loyalty equal to 1 (i.e. they exchanged animals with the same suppliers/buyers over the year), reflecting the stability of their movements. Regarding HEV prevalence, our data were dated (2009) and HEV prevalence is likely to vary over time. However, a more recent study also conducted in France reported similar prevalence figures (59% seroprevalence in Feurer et al. (2017) vs 65% in Rose et al. (2011)). Aggregating movement data on a yearly basis also appeared to be relevant due to the absence of seasonality in the French pig network (Relun et al., 2016, Salines et al., 2017b) and provided indicators representing the overall activity of farms over a year. A possible improvement to the network model may involve weighting links depending on the number of animals exchanged.",

            "text": "In the recent literature, several farm connectivity indicators were identified as risk factors for disease occurrence and spread (Martin et al., 2011, Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2017, Sintayehu et al., 2017). Our study found that the farms\u2019 in-degree was positively associated with high within-farm HEV seroprevalence. This is consistent with several studies conducted in livestock production sectors showing that farms having a high in-degree were more likely to be infected with a pathogen (Martin et al., 2011, Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2017, Sintayehu et al., 2017). Since repeated animal shipments to a farm from the same supplier were aggregated into a single link, the association between HEV seroprevalence and in-degree not only indicates that the HEV seroprevalence of farms increases with the number of incoming shipments, but it also proves that buying animals from several suppliers is linked to higher HEV seroprevalence. Our results also showed that the greater the ingoing closeness of a pig farm, the higher its HEV seroprevalence. A high value for the ingoing closeness centrality of a given farm indicates that the farm can be reached by its trade partners in only a few movements. Farm centrality in the network therefore appears to be a factor in vulnerability to HEV. This is consistent with the findings of previously published papers (Lee et al., 2017, Sintayehu et al., 2017). As Lee et al. (2017) demonstrated for PRRSV, we found that the odds of having higher within-herd HEV seroprevalence was increased more by ingoing closeness than by in-degree, meaning that the level of connectivity with all other holdings in the network is a better predictor of HEV infection than the number of directly connected farms. Unlike for other pathogens (Lee et al., 2017), no significant association was found between HEV within-farm seroprevalence and out-degree or outgoing closeness. The absence of an effect for these centrality indices was expected since HEV is mainly transmitted by infected pigs introduced into a na\u00efve population. Introduction into a farm due to the sole transit of a possibly contaminated truck loading pigs in the farm for an outgoing shipment is therefore extremely unlikely. Unlike Sintayehu et al. (2017) regarding bovine tuberculosis, our statistical model did not show any significant effect of a herd\u2019s betweenness on within-herd HEV seroprevalence. Production units with high betweenness centrality play a key role in the spread of disease throughout the network since they can build so-called bridges between distinct network components. Since we explored the role of centrality metrics in HEV occurrence in farms, and not in their ability to transmit HEV to other farms, the lack of an effect for betweenness was also expected. Ingoing and outgoing contact chain values were not found to have a significant effect on HEV seroprevalence either. Again, as we did not investigate a farm\u2019s potential for spreading HEV, the lack of a link between OCC and HEV seroprevalence is coherent. An association between ICC and HEV seroprevalence could have been expected. This kind of association has indeed been demonstrated in other studies, but Fr\u00f6ssling et al. (2012) showed that this link was pathogen-dependent: indeed, high ICC was found to be a risk factor in the occurrence of bovine coronavirus but not for bovine respiratory syncytial virus.",

The choice of the departmental level for our study was policy-oriented; indeed, French d\u00e9partements are local administrative areas and surveillance programmes are often designed and implemented on this scale. Due to the low precision of HEV farm-level prevalence data in quite a few d\u00e9partements, the distribution of the risk of exposure was large in these d\u00e9partements and the results in these d\u00e9partements therefore lack precision. Nevertheless, the outputs of the procedure used to assess the risk of HEV exposure were stabilised thanks to a high number of simulations. Given the form of the risk distribution, the median appeared the most appropriate metric for the risk of exposure. High variability in the median risk of exposure to HEV was observed depending on the French d\u00e9partement, confirming the relevance of designing targeted and differentiated surveillance strategies based on the area\u2019s risk level. Moreover, the discrepancy between the departmental observed prevalence figures and the departmental risk levels provides justification for monitoring not only highly prevalent areas but also those having at-risk movements coming from infected areas.",

For instance, no detailed data was available regarding farm size, pig density or farm management practices, but we checked that farm type (breeding, farrowing-to-finishing, etc.) was not a confounding factor. Several research teams have recently developed farm-level risk scores based on animal movements. For instance, Sch\u00e4rrer et al. (2015) introduced a cumulative score taking several parameters into account, including the ICC, the number of animals per incoming movement, the type of pasture and the number of weeks per year with movements. Another study proposed a method for calculating a disease-specific relative ratio for the increased probability of infection due to the introduction of animals (Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2014). Ribeiro-Lima et al. (2015) also identified farms with a higher risk of bovine tuberculosis infection using a model based on a risk score at movement level. A further stage in our study could be to build a farm-level risk score including both risk factors linked to pig movements and other farm-specific risk factors for HEV that have previously been identified (Walachowski et al., 2014). Such a score would make it possible to target only high-risk farms for more effective surveillance.",
