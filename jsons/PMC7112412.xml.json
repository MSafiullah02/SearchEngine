Essentially, these public health materials should provide adequate barriers against highly communicable bacteria and viruses. The spread of HIV, hepatitis viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc., by contacting with contaminated materials, has created increased pressure for the protection of the personnel with functional clothing. In the surgical zone, a lot of priority has been given to the protection of the surgical team from the patient's infectious blood and other body fluids and vice versa. Therefore, surgical fabrics should possess more antimicrobial properties (Vaideki et al., 2008, Mucha et al., 2002). The cellulose fiber skin scaffolds contain cellulose, a homopolymer of \u03b2-d-glucopyranose units linked together by (1\u21924)-glycosideic bonds (Gardner, Oporto, Mills, Said, & Samir, 2008). Cellulose molecules are linear in nature and are aggregated through van der waals forces, intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The reactive sites in the cellulose are the three-hydroxyl groups which are also widely responsible for metal nanoparticles bonding characteristics (Gardner et al., 2008).",

The primary thermograms of CSNCFs of GA and GG with reference to pure cellulose fiber (C) are shown in Fig. 6a and b respectively. The results indicated that, in case of AgNPs-loaded CSNCFs fibers, an initial weight loss at a temperature below 100 \u00b0C was observed and this was due to the loss of moisture present on the AgNPs and cotton fibers. Also, the maximum decomposition of all CSNCFs occurred at a slight higher temperature at around 398.68 \u00b0C when compared to that of pure cellulose fiber. Thermal studies led to the conclusion that with the increase in the percentage (%) of GA and GG, the stability also increased. This might be due to the rise in nanoparticles number on the cellulose fibres\u2019 surface, which occurred due to the strong bonding characteristics developed among AgNPs and cellulose fibers with increase in GA and GG concentrations. Overall, thermal analysis indicated that the CSNCFs designed were thermally stable.",

            "text": "AgNPs inherently possess bacteria killing property but more effective action of AgNPs on the bacteria always plays a major role in deciding its well functioning. In the current approach, much smaller synthesis of AgNPs by green process was developed. These smaller AgNPs enter into the bacteria cell more effectively, causing damage to the nuclei and resulting to bacteria death at a faster rate. Also, the smaller AgNPs kill bacteria more effectively than the bigger AgNPs was supported from the investigations of Morones et al. (2005), Varaprasad, Murali Mohan, Vimala, and Mohana Raju (2011), Varaprasad, Vimala, et al. (2011) and Murthy, Murali Mohan, Varaprasad, Sreedhar, and Mohana Raju (2008). The antimicrobial efficacy of the CSNCFs developed from AgNPs was tested against gram negative bacterium E. coli. The inhibition zone for all the fibers was found to be higher than 1.7 mm, shown in Fig. 7\n. According to the Standard Antibacterial test \u201cSNV 195920-1992\u201d, specimens showing more than 1 mm microbial zone inhibition can be considered as good antibacterial agents (Pollini, Russo, Licciulli, Sannino, & Maffezzoli, 2009). Hence, the developed CSNCFs from the current approach can be considered as good antibacterial agents and effective in killing the microbes. It was also concluded that the developed CSNCFs in the present investigation exhibited higher inhibition zone than earlier reported work of Ravindra et al. (2010). This achievement was because of synthesing much smaller AgNPs in the current approach when compared with the work of Ravindra et al. (2010). Hence, the improved result. Further, it was noticed that for the same concentration of polymer as reducing media, CSNCFs developed form GG show higher inhibition zone than those of CSNCFs developed from GA, which was evident form Fig. 7.",
