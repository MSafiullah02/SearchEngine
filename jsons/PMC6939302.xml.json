B\u2010cell numbers are typically present at low or normal levels, whereas CD4 T\u2010cell numbers may be decreased in some patients.4 CVID is believed to result from the absence of B\u2010cell maturation into long\u2010lived isotype\u2010switched memory B cells and plasma cells due to a variety of potential mechanisms that are poorly understood. Many patients with CVID experience heightened susceptibility to both infections and autoimmune and inflammatory complications (e.g., autoimmune cytopenia, enteropathy, and lung disease).5 Notably, patients with CVID with the lowest levels of isotype\u2010switched memory B cells (CD27+ IgD\u2212 IgM\u2212) have been reported to have the greatest risk of these complications.6 Because antibody deficiency is the prominent feature of CVID, Ig replacement therapy is the standard of care, although this treatment does not seem to alter the course of autoimmune and inflammatory complications in many patients.5\n",

In addition, prophylactic antibiotics can be considered for patients who continue to have infections despite Ig replacement therapy (generally azithromycin or amoxicillin) (Table 2).",

More recently, infection with norovirus has been reported as an important enteric infection in patients with CVID, and it has also been associated with chronic infection that causes malabsorption and severe enteropathy.21, 22, 23 Some patients may benefit from antiviral therapy to clear norovirus infection.22 Patients are also predisposed to GI infections with Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Surprisingly, despite frequent courses of antibiotics, patients with CVID appear to be at no greater risk than the general population of infection due to Clostridium difficile.7 Thus, in addition to infections of the sinopulmonary tract, GI pathogens are a major concern in CVID.

In fact, PJP pneumonia is the presenting manifestation of hyper\u2010IgM syndrome in almost half of diagnosed patients.39 This association with PJP pneumonia is likely due to the role of CD40L in T\u2010cell effector function, including activation of macrophages and other immune cells to kill intracellular pathogens, and thus such patients effectively have a combined (B\u2010 and T\u2010cell) immunodeficiency. In fact, mutations in CD40 ligand, CD40, and NEMO appear to be the most highly associated with severe infections and opportunistic infections, likely due to impairment of macrophage activation and T\u2010cell effector function.38, 40\nCryptosporidium is also frequently reported in patients with HIGM, and infection can contribute to high rates of sclerosing cholangitis and hepatobiliary disease.36 Patients appear to be at increased risk for parvovirus B19 and Candida infections as well.38 Patients with NEMO defects may be especially prone to invasive bacterial infections (abscesses, meningitis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and sepsis) as well as chronic infections including Mycobacterium avium\n36, 37, 40\n",
