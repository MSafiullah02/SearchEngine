Physicians managing patients with RID are encouraged to do the best for both the individual and society where antibiotic usage is concerned. It is suggested that continuing these approaches, while incorporating new value adding information, will ensure the development of future significant improvements in both our knowledge and management of all forms of RID. In addition, such a strategy may have the added benefit of prioritizing ongoing antimicrobial drug development and even streamlining regulatory drug approvals.",

Although this number approaches 50% with detailed microbiological and molecular testing in some studies, a microbial diagnosis eludes us in approximately half of all patients.\n6\n Whether this is because \u2018uncommon\u2019 organisms have not been tested for, or \u2018common\u2019 organisms have been missed because of an overexuberant host response is not known. Diagnostic inefficiency not only leads to a heavy reliance on empirical treatment strategies, but also contributes to lack of knowledge. Diagnostic inefficiency handicaps innovative thinking regarding the management of acute RID, particularly in those who are severely ill and not responding to empirical antimicrobial therapy.",

In the long term, however, there is a need to move away from an almost absolute requirement for empirical antibiotics in RID and move towards targeted antibiotic strategies as is the case for most other organ\u2010based infections.\n5\n To achieve this, there needs to be considerable improvement in the development of diagnostic tools for RID. These tools need to be rapid, reliable and available at the point of care. This is not impossible as has >been shown by the development of rapid HIV/CD4 diagnostic tests to help stratify limited antiretroviral use in developing countries.\n7\n, \n8\n Improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays for specific respiratory pathogens are also required. Improved sensitivity would enhance our ability to avoid using antibacterials in viral infections. Improved specificity would enhance our ability to use specific antibiotics and/or antivirals in the first instance and to use them to their maximum potential according to pharmacodynamic principles. Although the recent developments of multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays for viral and atypical bacterial organisms and enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays for some bacterial antigens (e.g. Legionella, Streptococcus pneumoniae) are promising, this area requires considerably more basic and applied research.",

As an example, the management of HIV/AIDS and its associated opportunistic infections has been revolutionized over the last 15 years by an approach that combines quantitative viral load and CD4 testing and effective antiretroviral therapy.\n9\n Similarly, lung and other organ transplantation has now become commonplace in western countries and one of the commonest infections post\u2010transplantation used to be cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis due to reactivation of this ubiquitous DNA virus. Twenty years ago, transplant physicians relied on poorly sensitive histopathological and non\u2010specific viral culture diagnostics for CMV disease and relatively blunt treatment approaches using antiviral treatments. The whole field was transformed when sensitive molecular testing was routinely applied and combined with more focused antiviral strategies yielding both better results and a richness of information regarding pathobiological events.\n10\n First, subclinical CMV reactivation was identified as being very common in the lung allograft and hence, a period of universal prophylaxis was appropriate for all CMV \u2018at\u2010risk recipients\u2019 (>90% lung transplant recipients). Second, an understanding of the dynamics of CMV reactivation following cessation of antivirals had immediate direct benefits to the patient (i.e. quantitative CMV detection to determine the need for specific antiviral use) and indirect benefits (subtle reactivation syndromes could now be related to specific immunological profiles and long\u2010term lung allograft outcomes). Third, the efficacy of specific intervention strategies could now be easily monitored. This conceptual framework is now being extended to other reactivating DNA viruses post\u2010transplantation and in the case of lung transplants is being increasingly used to delineate the overall influence of community respiratory RNA viruses on the lung allograft with a view to developing novel antiviral intervention strategies. In the setting of lung transplantation, the potentially direct and indirect (i.e. allograft rejection) life\u2010threatening consequences of respiratory infection are an important drive for innovation in management.\n11\n\n",

This information could aid decision\u2010making in terms of whether to use prophylactic or pre\u2010emptive antibiotics to avoid specific acute infection syndromes in certain \u2018at\u2010risk\u2019 patient groups, a strategy already used in HIV/AIDS. This information could also provide insights into host\u2013pathogen interactions in acute conditions, such as pneumonia as well as asthma and COPD, where acute exacerbations and chronic progression are an important burden of respiratory disease. This research could also provide a greater understanding of the heterogeneity of host\u2013pathogen interactions, thereby better explaining why patients vary in their susceptibility to RID and why the clinical expression of disease differs so much between patients.",
