Middle ear effusion is common to both. To distinguish between OME and AOM, the tympanic membrane must be examined for signs of acute inflammation. The single most powerful sign of AOM is the presence of distinct fullness or bulging of the tympanic membrane [12] . Although adjunctive techniques, such as tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry, can confirm the presence of middle ear effusion, neither technique can distinguish between OME and AOM. The most common and important error in diagnosis occurs when the clinician detects the presence of middle ear effusion and then uses a nonspecific marker of infection to classify the episode as AOM. Accordingly, middle ear effusion accompanied by fever, anorexia, nausea, irritability, and vomiting does not equal a diagnosis of AOM [9] . Figure 4 is an example of a normal tympanic membrane that is pearly gray in color, translucent, in normal position, and with clarity of the bony landmarks. Figures 5 and 6 are excellent examples of AOM demonstrating a bulging tympanic membrane. Figure 7 shows how a tympanocentesis is performed. The middle ear fluid is collected in the syringe or Senturia trap and sent to the laboratory for gram stain and culture [13] . Table 2 shows the current microbiologic characteristics of AOM [14216] . S. pneumoniae now accounts for 35%-40% of isolates and nontypeable H. influenzae for 30%-35% of middle ear isolates. Licensure of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000 led to a temporary decrease in the prevalence of S. pneumoniae infection and a relative increase in H. influenzae infection. However, the emergence of the nonvaccine pneumococcal serotype 19A has reversed this trend [16] . M. catarrhalis is responsible for 15% of cases. In the postpneumococcal vaccine era, the prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is quite variable; 35%-45% of H. influenzae strains are b-lactamase producing, and nearly 100% of the M. catarrhalis strains are b-lactamase producing [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 292, "end": 296, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 817, "end": 820, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1243, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1316, "text": "[14216]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1721, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2017, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 823, "end": 831, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 979, "end": 994, "text": "Figures 5 and 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1076, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1253, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Clinical diagnosis"}, {"text": "Finding a virus in the nasopharynx or middle ear fluid of an individual child with AOM (using a commercially available multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR assay) will not obviate the need for antibiotics, because it is understood that respiratory viruses are important in the pathogenesis of AOM.

However, the pathogenesis of the 2 diseases is very similar. Figure 8 shows the relationship of the nose and the paranasal sinuses. The nose is divided in the midline by the nasal septum. From the lateral wall of the nose come 3 shelf-like structures designated according to their anatomic position as the inferior, middle and seen best on the saggital section, the superior nasal turbinates.

The preceding URI causes a mucositis of the membranes that line the nose and the paranasal sinuses [20] . Although in almost all instances, the mucositis resolves spontaneously, in some cases, it results in obstruction of the sinus ostia. When there is a functional or mechanical obstruction of the paranasal sinus ostia, there is a transient increase in pressure in the sinus cavity followed quickly by the development of negative pressure in the sinus cavity. This negative pressure evolves because the oxygen component of the air is rapidly absorbed, leaving the pressure in the sinus negative by the partial pressure of oxygen. This negative pressure relative to the positive or atmospheric pressure in the nose or nasopharynx favors aspiration of the mucus laden with bacteria, from the nasal cavity in to the maxillary sinuses during sniffing and nose-blowing, resulting in contamination of the paranasal sinus [21] . If the mucociliary apparatus was functioning normally, this material would be swept out again. However, in the face of obstruction of the sinus ostia, the bacteria begin to multiply and secondary bacterial sinusitis develops. Studies from the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, have shown that ABS likely complicates viral URI in children 6-36 months of age in 8% of children [19] . These results are similar to those of Wald et al [22] . However, studies of the epidemiology of ABS have not been done in older children. There have not been comparable studies to those performed for children with AOM in which the precise viral isolates have been identified in children who subsequently develop ABS.

Infection is defined as the recovery of bacterial species in high colony count to assure that the bacterial species implicated derive from the sinuses rather than from contaminating bacteria inadvertently picked up in the nose. Studies performed in the United States in the early 1980s defined the microbiology of ABS by performing this procedure in 50 children [23] .
