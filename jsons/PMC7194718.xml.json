With this rapid expansion of the pandemic comes a growing need to ensure that accurate and credible information is accessible to public health authorities, researchers, and the wider public. This has prompted WHO, institutions, and individuals to develop online tools to track the spread of the pandemic. Although WHO's emergency preparedness is informed by established principles of international law,1 the multiplicity of actors has the potential to create confusion and barriers to accessing reliable and consistent data. These actors\u2019 categorisation of countries and territories, which could be subject to geopolitical considerations, remains unaccountable to affected populations.",

Initially listing data recorded by the Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under its entry for Palestine, the dashboard separately listed cases confirmed by the Israeli Health Ministry. On March 10, CSSE replaced the entry for Palestine with oPt; on March 11, the oPt entry was removed and its figures merged with the entry for Israel. International law does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over any part of the oPt,3, 4 and the Israeli Health Ministry does not record COVID-19 cases in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. How, then, can we effectively monitor the spread of the pandemic in the oPt using the CSSE dashboard?",

The removal of the oPt from the CSSE dashboard goes against global scientific cooperation and solidarity, resulting in discrepancies with official data recorded by the Palestinian and Israeli Health Ministries. Consistency with international law and the need for impartial data on the spread of COVID-19 requires databases to list the oPt separately, as reflected in WHO practice. Instead, removing the oPt and merging it with Israel undermines the credibility of the CSSE dashboard. All the more concerning is the dashboard's use of US State Department country designations,5 which have legitimised the acquisition of territory by force6 and undermined Palestinian identity and rights in Jerusalem.7\n",
