Currently, no FDA approved drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of LASV fever. The LASV glycoprotein complex (GP) is a promising target for vaccine or drug development. It is situated on the virion envelope and plays key roles in LASV growth, cell tropism, host range, and pathogenicity. In an effort to discover new LASV vaccines, we employ several sequence-based computational prediction tools to identify LASV GP major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II T-cell epitopes. In addition, many sequence-and structure-based computational prediction tools were used to identify LASV GP B-cell epitopes. The predicted T-and B-cell epitopes were further filtered based on the consensus approach that resulted in the identification of thirty new epitopes that have not been previously tested experimentally. Epitope-allele complexes were obtained for selected strongly binding alleles to the MHC-I T-cell epitopes using molecular docking and the complexes were relaxed with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction and dynamics of the epitope-allele complexes. These predictions provide guidance to the experimental investigations and validation of the epitopes with the potential for stimulating T-cell responses and B-cell antibodies against LASV and allow the design and development of LASV vaccines.",

LASV is endemic, particularly in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, The Republic of Guinea, Nigeria, and Liberia 2,3 . The transmission of LASV to humans occurs through the urine or feces of infected Mastomys rats and the virus spreads human-to-human through direct contact with the blood, urine, feces, or other bodily secretions of an infected person. LASV can be fatal and no approved effective therapeutics are currently available. The development of therapeutics such as antibodies and vaccines for the treatment of LASV is therefore of significant urgency 4-6 .",

GP1 is the receptor-binding subunit, and GP2 is the membrane-spanning fusion subunit 8-10 . The virion envelope protein spikes are composed of three heterotrimers, with each heterotrimer containing signal peptide, GP1, and GP2 11,12 , shown in Fig. 1 . A chalice-like GP trimer interacts with receptors on the cell surface, for example matriglycan, which mediates the entry of the virus into the host cell. In addition, the GP also interact with ERGIC-53 in the exocytic pathway, which helps to form infectious virions 13 . GP is considered to be a key factor for LASV growth, cell tropism, host range and pathogenicity, and as it is the only protein situated on the LASV virion surface, GP becomes a primary target for vaccine design 4 .",

            "text": "Identification of epitopes is an essential step for understanding disease etiology, immunotherapy, immunodiagnostics, and the discovery and development of epitope based-vaccines. An epitope-based vaccine has fewer side effects compared to conventional vaccines. Experimental identification of a promiscuous epitope involves many expensive and time-consuming steps, including the production of antibodies to map antigenic regions on a target protein, animal models, and determination of the crystal structure of antigen-antibody complexes using X-Ray crystallography. Computational identification of epitopes is often employed as a powerful and fast approach to facilitate the identification of potential epitope candidates that can decrease the number of validation experiments and time 15, 16 . Multi-epitope based vaccine development has already proven effective against several viral infections and cancer 17, 18 . In this study, we have identified and characterized T and B-cell epitopes for the LASV GP using different sequence and structure-based computational epitope prediction methods. We then selected potential B and T-cell epitopes for the LASV GP based on a consensus approach, and the novelty of the epitopes was examined with the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) tools. Subsequently, we identified strongly binding alleles to the MHC-I T-cell epitopes and modeled the allele structures and performed docking to understand the interaction between alleles and epitopes. We further investigated the stability and dynamics of the epitope-allele complexes using molecular dynamics simulations. Analyses of root-mean square deviations, hydrogen bond, interaction energy, and solvent accessibility showed that epitope-allele complexes are stable, indicating that the epitopes strongly bind to the alleles. The identified B and T-cell epitopes of LASV GP in the study can be useful for the development of effective vaccines against Lassa hemorrhagic fever.",

Subsequently, multiple sequence alignments were performed between the sequences using Clustal Omega 20 to select a conserved LASV GP for sequence-based epitope prediction. The corresponding X-Ray crystal structure of the Mouse/Sierra Leone/Josiah/1976 LASV GP was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5VK2) 4,21 for structure-based B-cell epitope prediction. The missing residues were modeled using the Charmm-Gui 22-24 . Prediction of B-cell epitopes.

In addition, a search of this strain with the experimentally determined structure available in the PDB displayed the 3.2 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the prefusion GP trimer of LASV in complex with the human neutralizing antibody 37.7 H. [PDB ID: 5VK2] as shown in Fig. 1 . This structure was used for the structure-based B-cell epitope prediction. A schematic representation of the epitope prediction cascade is shown in Fig. 2 . We have adopted multiple methods to predict and rank the epitopes as they use different criteria for their predictions. Some approaches may incorporate some properties that are similar such as solvent accessible surface area, but the predicted epitopes are different. Previous studies 52, 53 have suggested that the consensus approach would improve the specificity and accuracy of the epitope prediction as it can reduce the false positives. Therefore, we employ a consensus approach; for example, an epitope can be considered if it overlaps with even a single residue by at least two prediction methods. Our consensus approach selected several nanomer epitopes for MHC-I (Table S1 ). Although the predicted epitopes for MHC-II T-cell vary in length, the consensus core region between predicted MHC-II epitopes is a nanomer (Table S2 ) which is considered 54 an optimal length for the HLA.",

Analysis of Ramachandran plot 59 of the model shows 99.6% of residues are either in favored or in allowed regions ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), indicating that backbone torsion angles of these models are acceptable. The ERRAT overall quality factor 60 score was computed as 99, which is greater than the normally accepted score range for a high quality model of 50.

The Autodock Vina docking protocol has been previously demonstrated to successfully dock epitopes into allele structures 45 . However, we validated the capability of the docking protocol before docking the epitopes by redocking the epitopes into the allele crystal structure (PDB ID:3OX8) to see whether the crystal bound conformation of the peptide could be reproduced or not. The docked allele-epitope complex showed the same residue-epitope interactions observed in the epitope bound crystal structure, indicating that the Autodock Vina docking protocol was capable of reproducing the experimentally observed binding mode of the epitope. We applied Autodock Vina to each of the four MHC-I allele-epitope complexes. Autodock Vina found that the highest ranked docking structure had the following binding affinities: \u22125.5 kcal/mol for A1::E1 \u22125.0 kcal/mol Table 3 . Prediction of the B-cell epitopes.

To quantitatively understand the stability of the allele-epitope complex, we calculated the root mean square deviations (RMSD) of the backbone atoms of the allele-epitope complexes as a function of simulation time as shown in www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 5 also includes curves of the RMSD of the backbone atoms of just the allele, and separately, just the backbone atoms of the epitope. All alleles have an RMSD compared to their initial structures of approximately 2 \u00c5, whereas the allele-epitope complexes have a bit higher RMSD of approximately 2.5 \u00c5, indicating that the epitopes make the complexes more flexible. Interestingly, in the case of A3::E3, the allele and the complex show almost the same RMSD, suggesting that the complex is especially stable. To pinpoint why the complexes show a higher RMSD, we further computed the RMSD of only the backbone atoms of the epitope in each the complex. Figure 4 shows that the initial configuration of epitopes E1 and E4 is compact, and that both of these epitopes rearrange their configuration in the binding site and elongate during the 200 ns MD simulation. This elongated configuration is consistent with the investigations of Antunes et al. 61 on MHC-I epitopes.",

The hydrogen bond was calculated between the protein interface atoms with a distance cut-off of 3.5 \u00c5 and angle cut-off of 30o between the donor and acceptor heavy atoms. As shown in Fig. 6 , the number of H-bonds fluctuates during the MD simulations for all the complexes. The A3 complex has the largest number of H-bonds. Table 4 shows that during the last 50 ns of the MD simulation trajectory, the A3 complex averages 2.5 H-bonds. Additional analysis of the hydrogen bonding between allele and epitope are listed in Supplementary Table S4 . Figure 6b shows the interaction energy (electrostatic interaction + van der Waals contacts) throughout the entire MD simulation and Table 4 lists the average over the last 50 ns. The A3::E3 and A4::E4 display relatively stronger interaction energies than the A1:E1 and A2::E2 complexes. The comparison of RMSD, hydrogen bond, and interaction energy information indicates that the E3 epitope is an especially promising epitope candidate. Novelty analysis. The novelty of the four MHC I T-cell epitopes in Table 1 , the nineteen MHC II T-cell epitopes in Table 2 , and the ten B-cell epitopes in Table 3 identified in this study were analyzed using IEDB 34 . The IEDB database contains the epitopes that are annotated based on scientific literature. The IEDB showed that the E1, E4, E18, E22, E27, E29 epitopes, which bind to solvent exposed regions on the protein (Fig. 3) , have not been previously reported as LASV epitopes or vaccine candidates. In addition, this analysis further indicates that 24 other epitopes (E2, E3, E5, E6, E7, E8, E10, E11, E12, E14, E15, E16, E17, E19, E20, E23, E24, E25, E26, E28, E30, E31, E32, E33) have partial segments of their sequence reported as subsets of other epitopes, whereas E9, E13, E21 are exact match to previously reported sequences. For these epitopes, a comparison showing the overlap between the predicted epitopes in this study and previously known epitopes documented in IEDB is given in Table S5 . In addition to the epitopes in the IEDB, we compared our consensus predicted epitopes with the previously reported predictions [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] in Table S6 . This comparison shows a varying degree of overlap in the predicted sequences. The www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ novelty results confirm that thirty epitopes have not been previously tested experimentally as LASV epitopes, suggesting that their therapeutic potentials in designing vaccines against LASV can be further explored.",

            "text": "LASV hemorrhagic fever is endemic in West Africa, and no approved effective therapeutics are currently available. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the discovery and development of potential antiviral therapeutics. The LASV GP spike has emerged as a promising selective target for the development of novel vaccines as it plays an essential role in the virus-host interaction. Several in-silico studies [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] were performed to predict LASV GP epitopes with the use of a single prediction tool for each type of epitope. We have identified new T and B-cell epitopes using a variety of computational approaches, including twelve epitope prediction methods, protein-peptide docking, and MD simulations. The MHC I and II T-cell epitopes were separately predicted with the LASV GP sequence using well-known prediction methods. The predicted MHC I T-cell epitopes then were prioritized based on the consensus score, binding affinity, and antigenicity, while MHC II T and B-cell epitopes were prioritized based on the consensus score. Novelty analysis of the consensus-selected 33 epitopes showed that thirty of these predicted epitopes have either no overlap or only a partial overlap to previously reported sequences. Within this list of new epitopes, six sequences have no overlap with any known experimentally tested epitopes in the IEDB. In addition, docking and MD simulations were performed to further validate the MHC I T-cell epitopes. The simulation results show that the allele-MHC-I epitopes are stable, with favorable hydrogen-bond and interaction energy. Of these, Epitope E3 ( 233 FSRPSPIGY 241 ) segment was found to be especially stable. This study demonstrates that the adopted consensus epitope prediction strategy is valuable for in-silico investigations of known epitopes and the identification of new epitopes. Experimental validation of these epitopes may lead to the design and development of effective LASV vaccines. Table 4 .

All alleles have an RMSD compared to their initial structures of approximately 2 \u00c5, whereas the allele-epitope complexes have a bit higher RMSD of approximately 2.5 \u00c5, indicating that the epitopes make the complexes more flexible. Interestingly, in the case of A3::E3, the allele and the complex show almost the same RMSD, suggesting that the complex is especially stable. To pinpoint why the complexes show a higher RMSD, we further computed the RMSD of only the backbone atoms of the epitope in each the complex. Figure 4 shows that the initial configuration of epitopes E1 and E4 is compact, and that both of these epitopes rearrange their configuration in the binding site and elongate during the 200 ns MD simulation. This elongated configuration is consistent with the investigations of Antunes et al. 61 on MHC-I epitopes. Since the interactions between protein and epitope peptide are mostly influenced by non-covalent interactions, we computed the number of hydrogen bonds and the interaction energy between the allele and epitope as a function of the MD simulation time. The hydrogen bond was calculated between the protein interface atoms with a distance cut-off of 3.5 \u00c5 and angle cut-off of 30o between the donor and acceptor heavy atoms. As shown in Fig. 6, the number of H-bonds fluctuates during the MD simulations for all the complexes. The A3 complex has the largest number of H-bonds. Table 4 shows that during the last 50 ns of the MD simulation trajectory, the A3 complex averages 2.5 H-bonds. Additional analysis of the hydrogen bonding between allele and epitope are listed in Supplementary Table S4. Figure 6b shows the interaction energy (electrostatic interaction + van der Waals contacts) throughout the entire MD simulation and Table 4 lists the average over the last 50 ns. The A3::E3 and A4::E4 display relatively stronger interaction energies than the A1:E1 and A2::E2 complexes. The comparison of RMSD, hydrogen bond, and interaction energy information indicates that the E3 epitope is an especially promising epitope candidate.",
