Scientists directed their efforts toward viral polymerase in attempt to find inhibitors that might interfere with its function. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) was performed over 444 ns for a ZIKV polymerase model. Molecular docking (MD) was then performed every 10 ns during the MDS course to ensure the binding of small molecules to the polymerase over the entire time of the simulation. MD revealed the binding ability of four suggested guanosine inhibitors (GIs); (Guanosine substituted with OH and SH (phenyl) oxidanyl in the 2\u2032 carbon of the ribose ring). The GIs were compared to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and five anti-hepatitis C virus drugs (either approved or under clinical trials). The mode of binding and the binding performance of GIs to ZIKV polymerase were found to be the same as GTP. Hence, these compounds were capable of competing GTP for the active site. Moreover, GIs bound to ZIKV active site more tightly compared to ribavirin, the wide-range antiviral drug.

The protein in the solvent system was equilibrated at room temperature (310 K) then the solvent was minimized for 100 ps. Normal pressure and temperature (NPT) ensemble was used to relax the system for a total period of 5 ns, after that normal volume and temperature (NVT) ensemble was used in the production run for 444 ns.

Every 10 ns of the production run, the structure of the protein was retrieved for docking study. Therefore, the docking study was performed for 45 times during different dynamic states (different conformations). The retrieved structures were used to check the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and radius of gyration (R of G). These two parameters were used to check conformational changes during the course of MDS. AutoDock Vina software 44 was used to perform the docking study using default parameters. The protein is treated as rigid as we need to test the contribution of dynamics of the protein into inhibitor binding.

This implies a conformational change in the distal end of the arm that contains G46 and suggests its functional characteristics. Based on structural alignment made between ZIKV and HCV polymerases, this arm is a part of the fingers domain, where the fingers' tips interact with the viral RNA during the polymerization process. 45 Figure 2B illustrates the secondary structural elements of the ZIKV RdRp model before performing the MDS. It has nine alpha helices and six beta sheets. The active site aspartates are protruding from the beta turn between \u03b23 and \u03b24. The distance between the active site D124 and each of D6 and G46 is labeled at selected times during the MDS ( Figure 2C-E) . Figures 3A and 3B shows the calculated values of surface accessible surface area (SASA) in \u00c5 2 and the radius of gyration (R of G) in \u00c5. These values were calculated each 10 ns of the MDS using visualizing molecular dynamics (VMD) software. 46 SASA was calculated as relative exposure (0 to 1), that is, the exposure of each amino acid in the protein relative to per residue SASA values.",

In this study, the authors simulated the dynamics of ZIKV polymerase in water over 444 ns. The results supported our previous suggestion. In addition, four new compounds were introduced as promising binders to ZIKV polymerase active site based on the calculated binding affinities. On the other hand, the arm movement that occurred after 200 ns did not affect the binding of all of the small molecules. Future work is suggested to test the arm movement effect on the viral RNA upon polymerase binding. ",

The color is the same as in AFIGURE 3 A, Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) (\u00c5 2 ) and (B) radius of gyration (\u00c5) of ZIKV polymerase model versus time (ns) . One can notice that at the beginning of the MDS (in the first 70 ns), the values increase up to 45.6 \u00c5. This can be attributed to the swallowing of the protein in the solvent. 37 The R of G of the protein gradually increases up to a certain value. It then fluctuates around this value up to 200 ns before it starts to decrease again and fluctuate around 45.35 \u00c5. This may be also attributed to the arm movement close to the protein core which reduces the R of G. After 350 ns the fluctuation in the R of G increases again, probably due to reverse movement of the arm apart from the protein core.3.1 | Does arm movement have a contribution on small molecule binding to ZIKV polymerase?To answer this question, MD was performed over the course of the MDS to test the binding affinities of the studied drugs to ZIKV RdRp during 444 ns of simulation.Figure 4shows the average binding affinities of GTP, IDX-184, MK0608, R7128, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin to ZIKV RdRp over 444 ns of MDS (error bars represent the standard deviation). The binding affinities were calculated every 10 ns of the MDS and their values were found to lie between \u22125.5 and \u22129.1 kcal/mol. GTP (red circle) is better (having more negative binding affinities) compared to ribavirin and R7128. . By examining the H-bonds that were formed upon binding of the small molecules to ZIKV polymerase, one finds the same mode of interaction as that with HCV polymerase. H-bonds were formed between the small molecules and ZIKV polymerase active site aspartate D124 and two amino acids in the active site cavity; R190 and E194. These results imply the ability of the suggested compounds to compete with GTP for ZIKV RdRp active site over the entire period of MDS.",
