Later, Japanese scientists described HFRS in northeastern China as \u201cSongo fever\u201d and Swedish scientists as \u201cepidemic nephropathy\u201d; a similar disease was described in 1960 in China.1 The abbreviation \u201cHFRS\u201d was suggested by Mikhail Chumakov (Figure 2.10) in 1954 and was recommended for adoption at a World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Meeting in 1982.",

The main species of rodents, which are the hosts of hantaviruses in Russia, are presented in Table 8.1\n. The infection rate of mouselike rodents and insectivores lies within the limits 3.3\u00b10.5%.23 Hantavirus antigens have been detected in birds as well: the Oriental turtle dove (Streptopelia orientalis), coal tit (Parus ater), marsh tit (Parus palustris), Daurian redstart (Phoenicurus auroreus), nuthatch (Sitta europaea), black-faced bunting (Emberiza spodocephala elegans), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia), pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Ural owl (Strix uralensis), green-backed heron (Butorides striatus), and grey heron (Ardea cinerea).19 Hantavirus (Magboi virus, or MGBV) was isolated in 2012 from the hairy slit-faced bat (Nycteris hispida) in Africa (Sierra Leone),24 but the role of bats in the circulation of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome virus (HFRSV) is yet to be investigated in detail.",

The disease was named Crimean hemorrhagic fever. A viral etiology was demonstrated by experimental infection of volunteers by an ultrafiltrated homogenate of H. marginatum nymphs collected in 1945 from local hares.1 In 1963, the historical Hodzha strain was isolated from a patient with hemorrhagic fever in Uzbekistan, as was a set of strains from H. marginatum larvae and nymphs in the Astrakhan region, near the Caspian Sea.2., 3. In 1967, the similarity between the etiological agent of Crimean hemorrhagic fever and that of Congo virus, isolated from a patient in 1966 in Zaire (Congo), was demonstrated, so the virus was renamed CCHFV.4., 5.\n",

Exceptions are the viruses from Senegal, which represent a separate lineage in the S-segment analysis, and those clustered within group III in the L-segment analysis.

Hares and mouselike rodents play the main role in CCHFV circulation.1., 21., 22. Viremia in birds is not sufficient for vector transmission (although specific antibodies appear); nevertheless, ground birds are an important element of CCHFV transmission because they are the hosts for the preimaginal phases of H. marginatum development.16., 18., 23. During field investigations of Chatkalsky Ridge in Kirgizia, nymphs and larvae of H. marginatum dominated among field-collected materials from birds. The highest number of ticks was found on rollers (Coracias garrulus), crested larks (Galerida cristata), tree sparrows (Passer montanus), and black-billed magpies (Pica pica). In the Astrakhan region, rooks (Corvus frugilegus) are the main hosts for H. marginatum preimaginal phases.16\n",

The drop could have been due to the introduction of high-grade express diagnostics methods into clinical practice and an intensification in seeking out and diagnosing those suspected of having CCHF. At the same time, the disease extended its incidence into the new territories of the Volgograd region, with nosocomial CCHF cases recorded there once again.52 A warming of the climate promotes an expansion in the distribution of CCHFV to the north and the widening of endemic territory. Starting in 2002, CCHF was registered regularly in all of the units units of the Astrakhan region, accompanied by a mean morbidity of 3.7 per 100,000 population. More than 90% of CCHF cases occurred in the May\u2013July period, and about 85% of the inhabitants of the rural area fell victim to the disease. Morbidity reached 26 units and three towns in the Rostov region. In the Volgograd region, CCHF was originally reported in 2000 in dry steppe on the boundary between that region and the Kalmyk Republic. Morbidity in the Kotelnichesky unit of the Volgograd region reached 37.5 per 100,000 people. Sporadic cases (with 16.7% lethality) were found in six units in the southwestern part of the Volgograd region, where the modern northern boundary of the distribution of CCHFV lies. During 2000\u20132006, 170 cases of CCHF were reported in the Kalmyk Republic. CCHF morbidity was found in 26 rural units of Stavropol Krai, mainly in dry steppes, where the highest infection rate from H. marginatum existed.",

The similarity of this domain of ARTSV to other nairoviruses is 42\u201365% nt and 58\u201370% aa. The phylogenetic tree constructed by the maximum-likelihood method on the basis of the amino acid alignment of the RdRp catalytic core domain of nairoviruses confirms the topology of ARTSV on a newly formed genetic lineage (Figure 8.10, Figure 8.11, Figure 8.12). The nairoviruses on the tree can be divided into two main phylogenetic groups. The first group includes the nairoviruses, which are transmitted predominantly by ixodids: the Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever group (Hyalomma and Haemaphysalis, as well as Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, and Ixodes), the Dugbe group (mainly Amblyomma, but also Hyalomma, Rhipicephalus, and Haemaphysalis), the Sakhalin group (Ixodes), and the Tamdy group (Hyalomma). The first group also includes Erve virus (ERVEV), whose vectors are unknown.7., 8. The second phylogenetic lineage includes the nairoviruses from the Hughes, Issyk-Kul, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Qalyub groups, whose vectors are argasids: Argas and Ornithodoros. The tree topology of ARTSV shows that the virus is in the lineage of the nairoviruses transmitted predominantly by Ixodidae ticks, although all isolations of ARTSV were obtained from the Argasidae ticks O. alactagalis and O. verrucosus (Table 8.9). It can be assumed that the adaptation of ARTSV to argasids is the result of the the narrow ecologic niche occupied by those ticks, which are ticks of the subgenera Theriodoros and Pavlovskyella. Note that, although ERVEV, a European nairovirus, is phylogenetically close to the nairovirus transmitted by ixodids, the association of ERVEV with Ixodes spp. ticks has not been established in endemic areas (southern Europe).8\nERVEV has been isolated from shrews (Crocidura russula).9\n",

The genome of the prototypical strain LEIV-63Az of CASV was sequenced, and it has been shown that CASV is a member of the HUGV group of the Nairovirus genus.11 The S-segment of CASV is about 1,594 nt in length and has a single ORF that encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N, 497 aa). The second start codon, in position 7, is located in the N-protein ORF of CASV. The identity of the amino acid sequence of the N-protein of CASV with those of other nairoviruses is only 28%, on average. The cleavage site for caspase-3 (D285EVD288) that has been found in the N-protein of CCHFV is absent in CASV. Cleavage of N by caspase-3 is required for effective replication of CCHFV.12 Note that caspase cleavage sites in the nucleocapsid protein are also necessary for replication of human influenza A viruses.13 The M-segment of CASV, like that of the other nairoviruses, has a single ORF-encoded polyprotein precursor of the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc. The length of the Gn/Gc precursor of CASV is 1,376 aa. According to the results of an analysis of polyprotein in the program SignalP server 4.1, the first 32 aa constitute the signal peptide that is cleaved on the SSA/SY site. The cleavage site between pre-Gn and pre-Gc is in position 699 (VSG/IK). These data are confirmed by the location of transmembrane domains in mature proteins Gn and Gc that was defined with the use of the program TMHMM server 2.0. Six potential sites of N-glycosylation are predicted in the mature Gn protein of CASV, only one in the Gc protein. In general, the level of identity of polyprotein in CASV is 25\u201327% aa with that of other members of the Nairovirus genus (Table 8.3). The L-segment of CASV has an ORF (4,001 aa) that encodes the viral enzyme RdRp, which is the most conservative viral protein. The similarity of the RdRp of CASV to that of other nairoviruses for which complete genome sequences were available is 38.8\u201343.0% aa.",

The highest level of similarity (80% aa) that the RdRp core domain of CASV has is with the same sequences in viruses of HUG. On the dendrogram, constructed on the basis of a comparison of RdRp core domains, CASV is located on the branch of the HUG group (Figure 8.10, Figure 8.11, Figure 8.12). Note that viruses of this group (as well as CASV) have been isolated from Ornithodoros (Carios) ticks that are associated with seabirds on the coasts and islands of the world\u2019s oceans.2., 16. Thus, the phylogenetic relationship of CASV with HUG group viruses reflects the ecological features of those coasts and islands.",

The genome of the prototypical strain LEIV-858Uz of CHIMV was sequenced, and, on the basis of sequence analysis, the virus was classified as a novel member of the Nairovirus genus.9 Phylogenetic analysis based on a partial sequence of a catalytic center of RdRp placed CHIMV on the genetic branch of the QYBV group.9., 10. The amino acid sequence of this domain of CHIMV has an 87% identity with QYBV, Geran virus (GERV), and Bandia virus (BDAV), the other members of the QYBV group.11., 12., 13., 14. All these data are consistent with the fact that viruses of the QYBV group, as well as CHIMV, have an environmental connection to ticks of the Ornithodoros genus and to the burrows of rodents. QYBV has repeatedly been isolated from O. erraticus ticks, collected in burrows of the African grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) in the Nile valley and the Nile delta in Egypt.13 To date, only short sequences of the RdRp of QYBV are available in GenBank, but recently we gave a genetic characterization of GERV, isolated in Transcaucasia and, apparently, closely related to QYBV.11 The full-length amino acid comparison of CHIMV with GERV showed that their nucleocapsid proteins N (S-segment) have only a 55.6% identity. The similarity of complete amino acid sequences of RdRp (L-segment) is 74.8%. The similarity of the polyprotein precursor of Gn/Gc is 55.6%. The proteins of CHIMV have 30.3\u201342.4% aa (N-protein), 27.5\u201345.1% aa (Gn/Gc precursor), and 48.1\u201362.3% aa (RdRp) identities with their counterpart proteins in other nairoviruses. Among these nairoviruses, CHIMV has the highest level of similarity with ISKV, which is associated with bats in Central Asia (Figure 8.10, Figure 8.11, Figure 8.12).15\n",

The highest level of similarity all three proteins of GRNV have is to that of CHIMV (54.2\u201374.8% aa identity) and that of ISKV (42.4\u201362.3% aa identity).2., 3. Further analysis based on a comparison of partial sequences of the conservative core domain of RdRp of the nairoviruses showed that GRNV and CHIMV were most closely related to QYBV, which is the prototypical virus of the group of the same name.4 The nucleotide sequence of the RdRp core domain of GRNV has 74.3% nt and 97.1% aa identities with the counterpart sequence of QYBV. The data obtained allow GRNV to be classified as a virus of the QYBV group (Figure 8.10, Figure 8.11, Figure 8.12). The phylogenetic relationship between GRNV and QYBV corresponds to their similar ecological characteristics. QYBV was first isolated in 1952 by R. Taylor and H. Dressler from argasid Ornithodoros erraticus ticks collected in a rodent burrow in the Nile River delta near Qalyub village, Egypt (30\u00b0N, 32\u00b0E).5., 6., 7. Complement-binding antibodies to QYBV were found in humans (1.5%), camels, donkeys, pigs, buffalos, dogs, and rodents.1., 7. The antigenic group of Qalyub, a group that includes QYBV and antigenic-related BDAV, is one of the prototypical groups of the Nairovirus genus.5., 8. Previously, QYBV had been repeatedly isolated from O. erraticum collected in the burrows of rodents (Arvicanthis) in Africa. The second member of the QYBV group, BDAV, was isolated from O. sonari (a member of the O. erraticus group) collected in the burrows of rodents (mainly Mastomys) in Senegal.9., 10. The isolation of GERV, which is closely related to QYBV, is the first confirmation of the circulation of QYBV group viruses in Transcaucasia.",

ISKV (prototypic strain, LEIV-315K) was originally isolated from a pool of internal organs (liver, spleen, brain) of Nyctalus noctula bats, and their ticks (Argas (Carios) vespertilionis) were collected near Issyk-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan in 1970 (Figure 8.16\n).1., 2. Subsequently, ISKV was isolated from other bat species of the Vespertionidae family (Vespertilio serotinus, Vespertilio pipistrellus, Myotis blythii,\nRhinolophus ferrumequinum), and from birds, in different regions of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10., 11. Two strains were isolated from Anopheles hyrcanus mosquitoes and Culicoides schultzei biting midges, respectively (Figure 8.16, Table 8.10\n).3., 12., 13. Complement-fixation testing showed that ISKV is closely related or identical to the Keterah virus, which was isolated from Scotophilus temminckii bats and A. pusillus ticks in Malaysia in 1960.14., 15. A strain that has a close, one-sided antigenic relationship to ISKV, LEIV-218Taj (named Garm virus), was isolated from a common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) caught in the village of Garm, Tajikistan, 39\u00b010\u2032N, 70\u00b030\u2032E (Figure 8.16) in the spring (migratory period) of 1976.",

A pairwise comparison of the full-length nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the ISKV ORFs with those of other nairoviruses revealed 48.2\u201351.1% nt (39.0\u201342.1% aa), 37.3\u201339.7% nt (23.2\u201326.5% aa), and 43.1\u201347.0% nt (31.9\u201334.5% aa) identity for RdRp, the precursor of Gn and Gc, and the N protein, respectively (Table 8.10).

The outcome is generally favorable, and no deaths have been registered.18 Most of the cases were associated with the presence of bats in the attic of the residence. The primary route of human infection was apparently by argasid ticks, but respiratory or alimentary routes (via the feces and urine of bats) could not be excluded. Furthermore, a laboratory experiment showed that ISKV can be transmitted by Aedes caspius mosquitoes.22 The percentage of the population immune to ISKV in the southern part of Tajikistan is 7.8%. In Kyrgyzstan, antibodies to ISKV have been found in 0.7\u20133.2% of the human population.

The full-length genome of UZAV was sequenced, and, on the basis of phylogenetic analysis, the virus was classified into the Nairovirus genus.6 The genome of UZAV, like those of other nairoviruses, consists of three segments of ssRNA with negative polarity. The L-segment encodes RdRp (3,988 aa), the M-segment encodes a polyprotein precursor of the envelope glycoprotein Gn and Gc (1,621 aa), and the S-segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein N (485 aa). A pairwise comparison of the sequence of the UZAV genome with those of other nairoviruses showed that the virus is related most closely to ISKV. Full-length sequences of the L- and M-segments of UZAV have, respectively, 69.3% nt and 64.1% nt identities with those of ISKV. Amino acid sequences of RdRp (S-segment) of UZAV and ISKV have 76.2% aa similarity. The similarity of the amino acid sequences of the precursor of Gn and Gc for UZAV and ISKV is 66.7% aa. A comparison of the S-segments of UZAV and ISKV revealed that they are almost identical (99.6%). Thus, we can conclude that UZAV is a reassortant virus that got an S-segment from ISKV. Phylogenetic analysis based on L- and M-segments placed UZAV in the lineage of ISKV (Figure 8.10, Figure 8.11, Figure 8.12).6., 7.\n",

Subsequently 52 strains of TAMV were isolated in Uzbekistan,4., 5., 6., 7. Turkmenistan,8., 9., 10., 11. Kyrgyzstan,12., 13. Kazakhstan,11., 14., 15. Armenia,6., 16. and Azerbaijan8., 17., 18., 19. in 1971\u20131983 (Table 8.13\n). Most of the strains were obtained from H. asiaticum ticks, but several were isolated from birds, mammalians (including bats), and sick humans. On the basis of virion morphology, TAMV has been classified into the Bunyaviridae family. Serological studies by complement-fixation and neutralization tests revealed no antigenic relationships of TAMV with any known viruses.2\n",

Three strains of TAMV isolated in Uzbekistan (LEIV-1308Uz), Armenia (LEIV-6158Ar), and Azerbaijan (LEIV-10226Az) were completely sequenced.20 Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length sequences showed that TAMV is a novel member of the Nairovirus genus, forming a distinct phylogenetic lineage (Figure 8.10, Figure 8.11, Figure 8.12). The similarity of the amino acid sequence of TAMV RdRp (L-segment) with those of other nairoviruses is 40% aa, on average. The similarity of the RdRp of TAMV with that of the nairoviruses associated predominantly with ixodid ticks (CCHFV, Hazara virus (HAZV), and DUGV) is higher (40% aa) than that with viruses associated with argasid ticks (ISKV and CASV) (38% aa). The similarity of the TAMV polyprotein precursor of Cn and Gc with that of other nairoviruses is less than 25% aa. The similarity of the amino acid sequence of the nucleocapsid protein (S-segment) of TAMV is 33% aa with ixodid nairoviruses and 28% aa with argasid nairoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic core domain of the RdRp of the nairoviruses confirms that TAMV forms a novel group in the Nairovirus genus (Figure 8.10, Figure 8.11, Figure 8.12).20\n",

Two strains of BATV\u2014LEIV-Ast04-2-315 and LEIV-Ast04-2-336\u2014isolated in Russia were completely sequenced and placed into the cluster of the European strains.14 Within this group, they are phylogenetically close to strain 42, isolated in the Volgograd region in 2003 from Anopheles messeae (maculipennis) mosquitoes, for which the partial nucleotide sequences of the L- and M-segments are known. Between the strains LEIV-Ast04-2-315 and LEIV-Ast04-2-336, there is very high level of nucleotide and amino acid identity of three segments of the genome: 99.6/99.0% (L-segment/RdRp), 99.9/100.0% (M-segment/polyprotein predecessor), and 99.7/100.0% (S-segment/nucleocapsid). The levels of nucleotide identity of strain 42 with these strains on partial sequences of L- and M-segments are 98.6/98.8% and 100/100%, respectively; that is, for the M-segment, all available nucleotide polymorphisms are synonymous. The lowest observed genetic differences and the temporal and geographical proximities of the various strains of these viruses suggest a common origin as different isolates of the same strain of BATV circulating in the southern part of Russia.",

Messeae).2., 6., 17., 18., 20. In the southern hyperendemic regions of Russia, the main vector of BATV is An. messeae. According to our data, the infection rate of An. messeae in the middle belt of the Volga delta (Astrakhan region) reaches 0.188% (approximately 1 infected mosquito out of 500). Because this species of mosquito attacks mainly domestic animals, it serves as a biological barrier, reducing risk of infection to humas. In the northern areas (the subarctic, the northern taiga), BATV circulation is due mainly to Aedes mosquitoes: Ae. communis complex and Ae. punctor. Under experimental conditions, BATV was isolated from hibernating females of An. messeae. Hibernation is one of the mechanisms by which BATV survives during the winter.20., 25.\n",

Tahyna virus (TAHV) was isolated in 1958 by V. Bardos and V. Danielova from Ae. vexans and Ae. Ochlerotatus mosquitoes collected in the vicinity of the village of Tahyna in eastern Slovakia. (TAHV is identical to Lumbo virus,3 isolated in 1960 in Mozambique in the southeastern part of Africa.) Snowshoe hare virus (SSHV) was isolated in 1959 by W. Burgdorfer from the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). La Crosse virus (LACV) was isolated in 1960 by W.H. Thompson from the brain of a patient who died as the result of meningoencephalitis. Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) was isolated in 1961 by L.C. La Motte et al. from the Culiseta inornata mosquito. Inkoo virus (INKV) was isolated in 1964 by M. Brummer-Korvenkontio from Ae. communis and Ae. punctor mosquitoes in the south of Finland. Khatanga virus (KHTV) was isolated in 1982 from Aedes mosquitoes by D.K. Lvov.2., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10.\n",

As in other bunyaviruses, the L-segment encodes RdRp, the M-segment a polyprotein precursor of the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc, and the S-segment nucleocapsid protein (N). Two nonstructural proteins are found in infected cells: NSs, which encodes by adding an ORF in the S-segment; and NSm, which forms during the maturation of the Gn and Gc proteins from the precursor.11 Phylogenetic relationships of viruses of the CE serogroup are presented in Figure 8.27, Figure 8.28, Figure 8.29\n.",

Thus, having traversed the distance from southeastern Asia to North America, Ae. triseriatus is now part of the North American virus circulation.39 The clinical picture varies from an acute fever syndrome (in some cases with pharyngitis and other symptoms of acute respiratory disease) to encephalitis. Lethality is about 0.05%. From 40 to 100 cases occur annually. Generally, the virus attacks children age 10 and under (60%), a phenomenon that may be explained by the existence of a layer of immunity in up to 40% of adults.40 JCV (in the United States and Canada) and SSHV (in the northern part of the United States and in Canada) are associated with sporadic cases of fever and encephalitis.26 Domestic dogs are susceptible to LACV, which provokes encephalitis.21., 34., 41., 42. The role of deer in virus circulation has been established as well. Horizontal and vertical transmission of viruses provides an active circulation of the virus, a high rate of infection in mosquitoes, and stability of natural foci under the relatively rough conditions of the central and northern parts of the temperate climatic belt.43\n",

In forest\u2013steppes, specific antibodies to TAHV and INKV are marked out with an identical frequency. In semideserts, anti-TAHV antibodies are found twice as often as anti-INKV ones. The small number of strains isolated in these natural zones precludes establishing a relationship between the circulation of viruses and an immune layer of the population. Active circulation of CE serocomplex viruses on the territory of Russia results in regular registration of the diseases caused by these viruses. More than 7% of all seasonal fevers are etiologically linked to such viruses, and in some natural zones (the southern taiga and the mixed forests), this indicator increases to 10\u201312%.",

Palma virus (PALV), a virus closely related to BHAV, was isolated from Haem. punctata ticks in Portugal.5 Two viruses\u2014Kismayo virus (KISV) and For\u00e9cariah virus (FORV)\u2014antigenically related to BHAV were isolated in Africa.6., 7. These viruses have been merged into the Bhanja group on the basis of their serological cross-reactions.8., 9. In Transcaucasia, BHAV (strain LEIV-1818Az) was isolated from Ixodidae ticks Rhipicephalus bursa collected from cows in Ismailli District, Azerbaijan, in 1972 (Figure 8.40\n). Closely related to BHAV, RAZV (strain LEIV-2741Arm) was isolated from ixodid ticks Dermacentor marginatus collected from sheep near the village of Solak in the Razdan district of Armenia (Figure 8.40).10., 11. Serological methods (detection of antibodies in animals and humans) have shown that BHAV circulates in many Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.12., 13.\n",

The sandfly fever virus group includes Naples and Sicilian subtypes.1 Epidemics of the comparatively mild acute febrile disease of short duration brought on by these viruses in countries bordering the Mediterranean have been known since the Napoleonic Wars.2 The same disease was common among newly arrived Austrian soldiers on the Dalmatian coast each summer.3 Experiments conducted by an Austrian military commission proved that the disease was caused by a filterable agent in the blood of patients and that the sandfly Phlebotomus papatasi can serve as a vector to transmit the disease.4 During World War II, epidemics occurred among troops in the Mediterranean and two antigenically distinct strains were isolated from the blood of patients in 1943 in Sicily and Naples. These strains have been designated the sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) and sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV), with prototype virus TOSV.5., 6. Dr. A. Sabin gave a clinical description of the disease and demonstrated that immunity developed to one type of virus does not protect from infection caused by the other type. Later, several viruses related to SFNV (Anhanga (ANHV), Bujaru (BUJV), Candiru (CDUV), Chagres (CHGV), Icoaraci (ICOV), Itaporanga (ITPV), and Punta Toro (PTV)) were isolated from humans and rodents in South America.2., 3., 7. To date, viruses related to TOSV have been found in all regions of the world, including the Palearctic, Neotropical, Ethiopian, and Oriental zoogeographical regions.2 The prototype strain of TOSV was isolated from Phlebotomus papatasi sandflies in 1971 in Monte Argentario in central Italy.8 Two viruses antigenically related to TOSV\u2014Karimabad virus (KARV) and Salehabad virus (SALV)\u2014were isolated from Phlebotomus flies collected in 1959 near Karimabad village and Salehabad village, respectively, in Iran.9., 10. Several related viruses were isolated in the Mediterranean: sandfly fever Cyprus virus (SFCV;11 Adria virus (ADRV, Salehabad-like), isolated in Saloniki (alternatively, Thessaloniki), Greece;12 and Massilia virus, isolated near Marseilles, France.13 Epidemic outbreaks of sandfly fever whose agents could not be typified occurred in some central Asian countries and in Crimea during and after World War II and in Turkmenistan after the devastating earthquake of 1948. Antibodies to SFSV, SFNV, and KARV were found in the blood of humans in Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.14 Antibodies were also found in wild animals in Turkmenistan: the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus), the long-clawed ground squirrel (Spermophilopsis leptodactylus), and the hedgehog (Erinaceus auritus). Three strains of SFNV and two strains of SFSV were isolated in 1986\u20131987 from the blood of patients in Afghanistan.14., 15.\n",

Nausea, anorexia, vomiting, photophobia, pain in the eyes, and backache were common and were followed by a period of convalescence with weakness, sometimes diarrhea, and usually leucopenia. Viremia was present 24 h before and 24 h after the onset of fever.37 TOSV was established as the cause of one-third of previously undiagnosed human aseptic meningitis and encephalitis cases examined in central Italy. SFCV was associated with a large outbreak in the Ionian Islands of Greece.28 ADRV is associated with serious illness with tonic muscle spasms, convulsions, difficulty urinating, and temporary loss of sight. Human disease frequently goes unrecognized by local health-care workers. Studies of antibodies in people indicate that the most infections occur in children. When large numbers of unimmunized adults are introduced into an endemic area, the incidence of disease can be high. Human exposure to sandflies can be reduced by repellents, air-conditioning, and screens on windows. Because sandflies have a flight range of not more than 200 m, human habitats can be constructed at a distance from potential domestic sandflies\u2019 breeding places, such as chicken houses and quarters for other farm animals.19\n",

Antigenically similar isolates (strains LEIV-540Az and LEIV-810Az) have been obtained from blackbirds (Turdus merula) and I. ricinus ticks collected in the foothills of the Talysh Mountains in the southeast of Azerbaijan in 1968 and 1969, respectively.3., 4., 5. UUKV is distributed in the mid- and southern boreal zones of Fennoscandia and adjacent areas of the Russian Plain. Twelve strains of UUKV were isolated from I. ricinus ticks (the infection rate was 0.5%), and one strain from Aedes communis mosquitoes, in landscapes in the mideastern region of Fennoscandia.6., 7. Three strains were isolated from I. persulcatus ticks collected in Belozersky District, Vologda Region, Russia, in 1979.8., 9. UUKV was also isolated from the mosquitoes Ae. flavescens and Ae. punctor in the west of Ukraine, as well as at the border between Poland and Belarus.10., 11. Twenty-eight strains of UUKV were isolated from I. ricinus ticks collected in Lithuania and Estonia in 1970\u20131971.6., 7., 12., 13., 14. UUKV was isolated as well from birds and I. ricinus ticks in western Ukraine and Belarus.11., 15., 16. In central Europe, UUKV was found in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland.17., 18., 19., 20.\n",

The viruses of the Phlebovirus genus can be divided into two main ecological groups: those transmitted by bloodsucking mosquitoes (subfamily Culicinae) and midges (subfamily Phlebotominae), together called mosquito borne, and those transmitted by ticks (tick borne). UUKV is a prototypical virus of the Uukuniemi antigenic group, which includes at least 15 related tick-borne phleboviruses (Figure 8.37, Figure 8.38, Figure 8.39).26 The genome of UUKV consists of three segments of ssRNA: an L-segment 6,423 nt long, an M-segment 3,229 nt long, and an S-segment 1,720 nt long. The M-segment of UUKV, and indeed, that of all tick-borne phleboviruses, is shorter than the M-segment of mosquito-borne phleboviruses, owing to the absence of the nonstructural protein NSm, which is common in the mosquito-borne phleboviruses. Originally, ZTV was described as a virus closely related to UUKV. A full-length sequence comparison showed that the similarity of ZTV to UUKV is 77.3% nt identity of the L-segment (90.9% aa of RdRp) and 70.9% nt identity of the M-segment (81.5% aa).",

These rates indicate a high frequency (8\u201310%) of transovarial transmission of ZTV.7., 9. Probably, ZTV has a more pronounced ability to replicate in mosquitoes that are active in the subarctic climate zone (tundra landscapes) in July through the first half of August at temperatures sufficient for the accumulation of virus in the salivary glands.7., 9. During this period, circumpolar species predominate: Aedes communis, Ae. punctor, Ae. hexodontus, Ae. impiger, and Ae. nigripes; Culiseta alaskaensis is rarer. I. ricinus, together with I. persulcatus, I. pavlovskyi, I. nipponensis, I. kashmiricus, I. kazakstani, I. granulatus, I. nuttallianus, and I. hyatti, forms a single phylogenetic branch within the genus Ixodes.7., 9. The origin of this group of species is said to be southeast Asia. Currently, I. ricinus inhabits mixed and deciduous forests of the eastern coast from the Atlantic Ocean to the Middle Volga, but zoogeographical data show that the tick emerged in the Paleocene epoch in a belt of mesophilic forests.27 Comparative ontogenetic analysis revealed a relation of I. ricinus to the southern group of I. persulcatus (I. kazakstani, I. kashmiricus, I. nipponensis, and I. hyatti) and, through that group, with I. pavlovskyi.",

The first hint that Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) was etiologically linked with Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, antigenic complex of TBE) came in 1940\u20131945.1., 2. The disease arose in the spring\u2013summer in the northern forest\u2013steppe landscape zone in the region around Omsk, western Siberia; Figure 8.48\n) an area with a wide network of lakes. About 200 cases with two lethal outcomes (\u201catypical tularemia\u201d and \u201catypical leptospirosis\u201d) were investigated (without laboratory confirmation) from the end of April to the beginning of October in 1945. In the spring\u2013summer of 1946, the endemic territory enlarged and the number of cases increased to 623, with 4 lethal outcomes.3., 4. In 1947, a large expedition (about 50 members) under the leadership of Mikhail Chumakov (Figure 2.10) began to work in the Omsk region; the virus etiology of OHF was proven, and the disease acquired its modern name: OHF.3., 5., 6., 7. The expedition produced prodigious results: The prototype strain OHFV/Kubrin was isolated from the blood of one patient; the mechanism of transmission of the virus by the Ixodidae tick Dermacentor reticulatus was established; the epidemiological and clinical features of OHF, as well as its pathogenesis and pathomorphology, were described; and inactivated vaccine from mouse brain was developed and prepared for epidemiological trials.5 Later, the role of another species of Ixodidae ticks (D. marginatus) as an OHFV vector was revealed.8., 9.\n",

In some of those years, however, a high number of Ixodes apronophorus, all phases of which feed on the water vole (Arvicola terrestris), become involved in the virus\u2019s circulation on a par with D. pictus ticks. Ar. terrestris makes fodder migrations in June\u2013August from damp locales (where their infection takes place) to coastal meadows (where peak activity of the larvae and nymphs of D. pictus is observed during those months). Small animals living in those meadows become infected as they feed on the D. pictus larvae and nymphs. In damp locales, I. apronophorus could infect muskrats.

Close interactions among O. zibethicus and local populations of Arvicola terrestris emerged. Ar. terrestris has periods of rapid population growth followed by epizootics of tularemia, leptospirosis, and OHFV. Muskrats suffered these epizootics together with other local species of rodents: Microtus oeconomus, M. gregalis, Myodes rutilus, Apodemus agrarius, and Ar. terrestris.13 The OFV infection rate among muskrats is about 15% in both the autumn\u2013winter and the spring\u2013summer periods.16 Latent infection was established in all rodents except the muskrat.18\n",

Donohue in September 1958 from the brain of a five-year-old child who was admitted to the hospital with blinking, tremors, and dizziness in the small town of Powassan in the north of Ontario, Canada.1 The child later died of encephalitis. Subsequent virological and serological surveys carried out in the Powassan\u2013North Bay and Manitoulin Island areas of northern Ontario during 1959\u20131966 elucidated a summer transmission cycle involving Ixodidae ticks and small wild mammals.2 Neutralizing antibodies were found in 1.1% of humans.3 A virus strain isolated from a pool of Dermacentor andersoni collected in Colorado was identified as POWV.4 In Russia, POWV was isolated in 1972 in Primorsky Krai from Haemaphysalis neumanni collected from spotted deer (Cervus nippon) (Figure 8.50\n).5\n",

During field expeditions in 1937\u20131940, the historical strain TBEV/Sofjin was isolated from the brain of a patient with encephalitis who died in Khabarovsk Krai (Figure 8.52\n). In that period, the main vector of TBEV\u2014Ixodes persulcatus ticks\u2014was established, epidemiological peculiarities of TBE were studied, and the first anti-TBEV vaccine was developed on the basis of intracerebrally infected mouse brain and was successfully used in medical practice.2 Complex expeditions were undertaken by a number of prominent virologists (L.A.

The infection rate in I. ricinus is about 0.2% in the northwestern part of the Russian Plain, 0.4% in Lithuania, and 3.8% in Crimea. The infection rate in I. persulcatus is, as a rule, higher, ranging from 0.6% to 4.8%.

Birds transfer JEV from natural to synantropic biocenoses, where, thanks to Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes willingly attacking wild birds, pigs, persons, synantropic birds, and domestic animals (chiefly pigs), these all join into JEV circulation.7 Infection in pigs could be inapparent, or it could be clinically expressed with encephalitis and a lethal outcome. The level of viremia in infected pigs is enough to infect mosquitoes. Such epizootics among pigs are, in effect, amplifiers for JEV, serving as prerequisites for the development of epidemics, first of all among people living in the countryside, but then among city dwellers as well.",

(See \u201dTaxonomy\u201d next.) Strain Eg101, isolated from the sera of a child without clinical signs in Egypt,2 is the prototype for African genetic lineage I, widely used for investigations. WNV belongs to the JEV group, has the broadest antigenic properties, and, on theoretical grounds, appears to be the most ancient member of the Flavivirus genus.3 Low-passaged WNV strains are known by many investigators to be common causes of laboratory infection, apparent or inapparent.4\n",

The topotypic isolates of WNV in Australia\u2014Kunjin virus (KUNV)\u2014belong to clade 1b, and clade 1c is formed by isolates from India.5 Subsequently, two genetically divergent Rabensburg strains\u201497\u2013103 (isolated in the Czech Republic) and LEIV-Krnd88-190 (isolated in Russia)\u2014were proposed to form novel lineages III and IV, respectively.6., 7., 8.

Seven cases (12.5%) had a lethal outcome. The virus was found in Culex sp. and Aedes vexans mosquitoes caught in September\u2013October in New York City and in the states of New Jersey and Connecticut. Positive results were obtained by RT-PCR during an investigation of brain tissues of dead birds: crows, seagulls, storks, herons, ducks, cuckoos, pigeons, jays, robins, hawks, and eagles. The genomes of the strains that were isolated were found to belong to the first genotype and were close to the strains isolated in 1996 in Romania and in 1998 in Israel.33 In 1999, WNV was registered in the United States, probably translocated there by migrating birds or by infected mosquitoes inhabiting the holds of visiting ships. WNV was found in Florida and on the Cayman Islands. In the spring of 2002, WNV extended its coverage to the eastern part of the United States through the central and Mississippi migratory pathways. Also in 2002, the virus reached the central regions of the United States and southern Canada and, in the fall of that year, Mexico, Jamaica, other Caribbean countries and Central and South America (Cuba, Guatemala, and the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles islands). Then, in 2004, WNV penetrated to California through the Pacific migratory pathway.",

The number of diseased individuals reached 4,000\u20139,000 cases in separate years. During 1999\u20132006 in the United States, more than 16,000 WNF cases were identified, with more than 600 (4%) succumbing to the disease. The economic damage was estimated in billions of dollars.36., 37. Today, WNV continues to circulate in the United States.38., 39. Morbidity grew in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina.40 In Montana, the infection rate of people living in close proximity to a colony of pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is five times higher than in other regions of the state.41 In a sea park in Texas, grampuses (Orcinus orca) contracted encephalitis and died,42 and previous episodes of polyencephalomyelitis were revealed among seals (Phoca vitulina). Also in Texas, three new genetic clades of WNV were found, testifying to rapid evolution of the virus on the American continent.43 In 2012, an epidemic arose again, accompanied by a large number of lethal outcomes. In Texas, a state of emergency was declared.",

Ninety percent of these species of birds overwinter on the African continent.

The highest portion of positive results was obtained from internal parts of wild birds in 2001 and was decreasing until 2004 (Figure 8.72\n).",

W.B. Becker was the first who identified Influenza A virus among wild birds when he described antigenic relations between A/tern/South Africa/61 and A/chicken/Scotland/59 strains and developed the hypothesis that wild birds played a role in disseminating the virus.38 Then, during 1960\u20131970, Gram Laver (Australia), Dmitry Lvov (Figure 2.36) (former USSR, Russia), and Robert Webster (Figure 2.20) (USA) independently formulated the more general idea that there were natural foci f Influenza A virus and that wild aquatic birds were a natural reservoir for the virus.39., 40., 41., 42.\n",

The first three strains were isolated in 1960 in Crimea and in the Kharkov region.44 These prototypical strains were Ya-60, B-60, and S-60. 45 Several other strains (Z-61, C-61, N-62, D-62, D-62, Z-62, S-64, and BV1) were isolated from ducks and chickens46 in 1961\u20131964. The most peculiar features of these isolates were revealed in comparative studies performed at the D.I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow. As early as 1964, the duck strains Ya-60, B-60, Z-61, and C-61 were analyzed with respect to their antigenic specificity by HIT and were found to be antigenically distinct from the human H1 and H2 viruses.47 After the appearance of the H3 pandemic virus in 1968, some of the Ukrainian duck strains were shown to be antigenically\nrelated to the new subtype. In 1969, L.Ya. Zakstelskaya et al. used HIT to demonstrate that duck strains B-60 and BV1 cross-reacted with the A/Hong Kong/1/1968 pandemic strain and other human strains isolated in 1968, whereas the strain Ya-60 exhibited a negligible cross-reaction with the human viruses.48., 49. Moreover, HIT testing also showed that the B-60 and BV1 strains of the virus reacted with human sera, including those collected in 1881\u20131886 and in 1905\u20131908. On the basis of this phenomenon, the authors suggested that an avian virus similar to the strains B-60 and BV1 was the precursor of the human pandemic strain and that this antigenic variant had appeared in humans several times in the past.48 Formerly known as Ya-60, strain A/duck/Ukraine/1/1960 was shown50 to belong to the H11N2 subtype, whereas A/duck/Ukraine/2/1960 was identified as H3N6 and A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 as H3N8.",

The NS gene of an H14N5 strain isolated from a mallard was much more distantly related to the NS gene of the viruses isolated from gulls.76 The results suggest that reassortment events play a significant role in the evolution of H14 viruses, with the NS gene being an important determinant of the range of the host.",

During longitudinal wide-scale monitoring of Influenza A viruses among wild bird populations in Northern Eurasia, several H5N2 and H5N3 strains were isolated in 1976 and 1981 in the Caspian Sea basin.70., 74. More recently, in 1991\u20132001, strains belonging to the same subtypes were isolated in Siberia, and their features proved to be relevant to H5 virus circulation. Onn the one hand, the HAs of the strains isolated from teals in 2001 in Primorsky Krai, as well as the HAs of strains isolated from a mallard in Lake Chany in western Siberia in 2003, were shown to be closely related to HAs of H5 strains isolated in 1997 in Italy from poultry.79., 82. On the other hand, the HA of the H5N3 strain isolated from a wild duck as early as 1991 in Altai Krai in southwest Siberia was closely related to the HA of A/duck/Malaysia/F119-3/1997 (Figure 8.95\n). The HA of the Altai (1991) and Lake Chany (2003) viruses had a monobasic HA1\u2013HA2 cleavage site, and, accordingly, it had a low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) phenotype.72., 79., 82., 86.\n",

The extent of the exchange is demonstrated by the relatedness of different genes of the Russian isolates to the genes of European strains, on the one hand, and South Asia isolates, on the other.72., 76., 83., 84. The exchange is to a certain extent restricted by host specificity, but this restriction is not rigid, and the virus genes frequently traverse interspecies barriers. Avian migration routes crossing Russian territory are an important factor in the gene flow. The extensive intra- and interspecies contacts in the natural habitats of wild birds in Russia stimulate rapid virus evolution and the appearance of new variants through reassortment events and, presumably, through the postreassortment adjustment of genes, thereby restoring the functional intergenic match.87., 88. Another factor may be the occurrence of avian influenza viruses in lake water, first registered in 1979 in eastern Siberia.41 This phenomenon might provide a means for the temporal as well as territorial transfer of genes, as suggested by the recent detection of influenza viral RNA in the ice of high-latitude lakes in the Lena River basin in the Sakha\u2013Yakutia Republic.89\n",

Preparing for these two possibilities, we increased our surveillance in the southern part of western Siberia (through the Russian Foundation for Basic Research Project 03-\u043004-49158) and in Primorski Krai (through the International Science\u2013Technical Center Project 2800) in the spring of 2004. In April of 2005, a wide epizootic outbreak emerged at Kukunor Lake (also called Qinghai Lake) in Qinghai Province, China, and from this location the virus could spread through the Dzungarian Gate, which links the northwestern mountain ranges of Tibet with the western Siberian lowland. Our second prediction was confirmed as well, when HPAI H5N1 first appeared in Northern Eurasia, in western Siberia (Novosibirsk Region, Russia) in the summer of 2005 (Figure 8.98\n). Although the official start of the epizootic among poultry was dated July 10, 2005 (Table 8.50\n), that one occurred among wild birds about 2 weeks before was retrospectively established.5 The outbreak spread quickly and caused over 90% lethality among poultry.",

A deletion in the NA gene in amino acid positions 49\u201360 indicated that the strains belonged to the genotype Z, which dominated in 2004 in southeastern Asia.94 The other group of strains was isolated by a team of researchers from the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR (also known as the Vector Institute) in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Region. Two strains were isolated from chickens and one strain from a turkey in the village of Suzdalka, Dovolnoe District, in July 2005. The viruses were isolated from homogenates\nof turkey spleen and chicken kidneys. The isolated viruses belonged to subtype H5N1, and their HA gene was closely related to the HA gene of the viruses isolated near Qinghai Lake in China in 2003. The sequences of the internal genes (PB1, PB2, PA, and NS) revealed a similarity to the avian H5N1 viruses isolated in Hong Kong in 2004 and in 2005 in Shantou,\nGuangdong Province, China.95 The viruses were highly pathogenic to chickens in a laboratory test.96\n",

In November 2005, an epizootic with mass deaths emerged in the downstream part of the mouth of the Volga River (Figure 8.98) among a local population of mute swans (Cygnus olor).102 Many of the swans contracted neurological disorders, including the inability to keep their neck or head raised, paralysis of the extremities (mainly the legs), and depression. Because there are no human settlements in this part of the Volga, no infections were detected among poultry. Migrating tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula), among which no clinical features were detected, are suspected to be the source of the infection, because the start of the epizootic coincided with the appearance of the ducks.

Dramatic events occurred June 10\u201328, 2006, at Uvs-Nuur Lake, which is situated on the boundary between the Great Lakes Depression of Mongolia and the Tyva Republic of Russia (Figure 8.98). An estimated 3,000-plus birds died in the Russian part of this lake, which is only about 1% of the total area of the lake. The species most affected was the great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus); as also affected were coots (Fulica atra) and cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo). Terns and gulls were involved in the epizootic to a significantly less extent. The absence of poultry farms in the vicinity of Uvs-Nuur Lake precluded outbreaks among poultry. The Tyva strains appeared to be the beginning of a new genetic lineage in the Qinghai\u2013Siberian genotype 2.2. The lineage was designated as a Tyva\u2013Siberian subgroup104 (Figure 8.99) that was isolated not only in Siberia, but also in Europe. It is believed that the Tyva\u2013Siberian subgroup emerged in 2006 on nesting grounds of wild ducks in western Siberia. These birds were thought to have been infected in 2005 at the Great Lakes Depression in Mongolia and at their overwintering grounds in India. After the virus was introduced into the nesting places of Northern Eurasia, it spread through the region.",

The occurrence of the outbreak at that time of the year seems to preclude the participation of wild waterfowl in introducing or spreading the virus; in addition, terrestrial wild birds tested negative by RT-PCR. The virus was isolated (Table 8.51) from dead and sick poultry, and all the isolates were identified as HPAI H5N1 (Table 8.52) with a high level of sequence similarity to the Qinghai\u2013Suberian genotype 2.2 (Figure 8.99). This outcome implied a common source of infection for all the local outbreaks (Figure 8.101), and subsequent epidemiologic investigation demonstrated a link to live-bird markets in Moscow, where the affected farmers had purchased poultry several days before. A complete genome analysis of the prototype A/chicken/Moscow/2/2007 revealed105 that the highest similarity occurred for the strains isolated in the Caucasus region during the winter of 2005\u20132006: A/cat/Dagestan/87/2006, A/Cygnus cygnus/Iran/754/2006, A/chicken/Krasnodar/01/2006, A/chicken/Adygea/203/2006 (the similarity for nucleotide sequences of PB2 was 99.5%; PB1, 99.3%; PA, 99.7%; HA, 99.1\u201399.4%; NP, 99.4%; NA, 99.1\u201399.6%; M1, 99.5\u201399.9%; and NS1, 99.9%). The closest neighbor for A/chicken/Moscow/2/2007 was found to be A/Cygnus cygnus/Iran/754/2006. Later, this genetic subgroup of HPAI/H5N1/2.2 was designated as \u201cIran\u2013North Caucasian\u201d (Figure 8.99). Nevertheless, A/chicken/Moscow/2/2007 differed significantly from other Qinghai\u2013Siberian strains: In four genes\u2014\u0420\u04122, \u0420\u04121, \u041d\u0410, and NP\u2014there were 12 unique amino acid substitutions (Table 8.53\n), and all 8 amino acid substitutions in PB1 were unique at that time, affording evidence of active circulation of the virus before 2007. However, the specific origin of A/chicken/Moscow/2/2007 has not been officially identified, and it is suspected that the virus was circulating in a small intermountain\nvalley ecosystem in the north or south Caucasus in the winter of 2007 and was introduced into the live-bird market through contaminated poultry cages or contaminated grain.",

Unfortunately, the infection was not reported in time, and infected poultry manure was spread on adjacent fields, where wild terrestrial birds could be infected.107 This exposure is thought to have contributed to the infection of a number of species. including rooks (Corvus frugilegus), jackdaws (Corvus monedula), rock doves (Columba livia), common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), tree sparrows (Passer montanus), house sparrows (Passer domesticus), and more. Surveillance of these species by RT-PCR detected H5 virus in 60% of pigeons and crows, in around 20% of starlings, and in 10% of tree sparrows, all without clinical features. These results were confirmed by viruses isolated from wild birds and poultry (Table 8.51). Birds whose infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and virus isolation seemed reluctant to move and had ruffled feathers. On necropsy, the birds were observed to have had conjunctivitis; hemorrhages on the lower extremities and in muscle, adipose, intestine, mesentery, and brain tissue; and changes in the structure of the pancreas and liver. Wide involvement of wild terrestrial birds in virus circulation, presumably from the exposure to infected chicken manure, distinguished this outbreak from others. Genome analysis (Table 8.52) revealed that the strains which were isolated belonged to the Iran\u2013Northern Caucasian subgroup of the Qinghai\u2013Siberian genotype (Figure 8.99). They were phylogenetically similar to A/chicken/Moscow/2/2007 and 13 unique amino acid substitutions with respect to Qinghai\u2013Siberian consensus in PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, and M2 (Table 8.53).",

The other genes of the Qinghai\u2013Siberian genotype are associated with group Z, which has dominated among poultry in southeastern Asia since 2003\u20132004.93., 94. The group Z genotype has several unique genetic markers, including a 20-mer amino acid fragment deletion C49NQSIITYENNTWVNQTYVN68 in the N1 gene, compared with the genotype of A/goose/Guangdong/1996. The HA cleavage site\u2014P337QGERRRKKRGLF349\u2014has multiple basic amino acid insertion. Three types of silent nucleotide substitutions are known in the coding region of the cleavage site among members of the Qinghai\u2013Siberian clade: G\u21921020A (A/\u0441hicken/Volgograd/236/2006), G\u21921028A (A/pied magpie/Liaoning/7/2005), and A\u21921044G (A/chicken/Crimea/04/2005). In addition, four types of amino acid substitutions are known: G\u2192339R (A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/{1,3}/2005; A/brown-headed gull/Qinghai/1/2005; A/great black-headed gull/Qinghai/3/2005; A/great cormorant/Qinghai/3/2005; A/whooper swan/Mongolia/13/2005), R\u2192341G (A/chicken/Sudan/1784-{7,10}/2006), R\u2192343K (A/pied magpie/Liaoning/7/2005), and K\u2192344R (A/whooper swan/Mongolia/7/2005). The presence of consensus G339 makes the Qinghai\u2013Siberian clade different from other HPAI/H5N1 variants from southeastern Asia containing consensus R339. The highest portion of R339, 5/15 (33.3%), was detected in the initial outbreak at Kukunor Lake, suggesting that the Qinghai\u2013Siberian strains which originated from southeastern Asia were under a \u201cbottleneck\u201d selection at an early stage of their evolution.

In winter, 2005\u20132006, HPAI/H5N1/2.2 was under selection in two main overwintering areas: (1) Africa, Transcaucasia, and the Middle East (penetrating along eastern and western European flyways); and (2) India and central Asia (penetrating along the Indian\u2013Asian flyway).54 The first overwintering area could be the source for the Iran\u2013North Caucasian subgroup, the second for the Tyva\u2013Siberian subgroup. Returning to their nesting areas in Northern Eurasia in the spring of 2006, wild birds afforded a mixed virus population the opportunity to spread (Figure 8.100).5., 24., 28., 42., 43., 108. A decrease in the potential of isolated strains to reproduce in vitro (Figure 8.102\n) is more evident in poultry (TCID50=11.847\u20130.272\u00d7t) than in to wild birds (TCID50=6.185\u20130.066\u00d7t)115 (Time t is time expressed in months starting from the beginning of 2005.)

            "text": "Although HPAI H5N1 has penetrated into Northern Eurasia through the Dzungarian flyway of wild birds, this fact did not exclude the possibility of the virus transferring through other flyways \u2014(e.g., through the Far East\u2013Pacific flyway).54 Indeed, in April 2008, a second breach of HPAI H5N1 into Northern Eurasia emerged in the Russian Far East116 and was linked with another genotype: 2.3.2.1 (Figure 8.99, Table 8.52). The epizootic originated from unvaccinated poultry in the outermost backyard of Vozdvizhenka, a village in Primorsky Krai surrounded by a small river and meadow where poultry often interacted with wild waterfowl. One initial theory of the introduction of the virus to poultry was from the birds\u2019 exposure to hunted ducks, but the direct interaction of wild birds with poultry seems more likely. The isolates (see Table 8.51) from dead chickens and the common teal (Anas crecca) collected in the vicinity of epizootic farms were identical and indicated a direct role of migrating birds in the introduction of the virus. The teal, which appeared to be the most likely source of infection of poultry, had no obvious behavior changes but did have hemorrhagic lesions in the intestines on necropsy. It is interesting to underline the fact that common teals were the source of isolation of H5 strains in Primorski Krai in autumn 2001. The teals migrate for long distances, so, the operative hypothesis is that HPAI/H5N1/2.3.2.1 variants may have migrated from the Far East to southern China, Vietnam, or Laos. The HPAI/H5N1 virus was widely distributed in Primorski Krai in the spring of 2008: According to RT-PCR testing, 26% of wild ducks in the Suifun River\u2013Lake Khanka lowland were infected.116 However, during monitoring in the autumn of 2008, we were not able to find HPAI/H5N1. Nevertheless, the emergence of the HPAI/H5N1 virus in Primorski Krai creates a new type of HPAI stratification in Northern Eurasia (genotype 2.2 in the eastern portion of the subcontinent, genotype 2.3.2.1 in the western portion), as well as the threat of introducing HPAI into North America. The closest neighbors of Primorski Krai 2008 strains are A/chicken/Viet Nam/10/2005 (the nucleotide sequence similarity for the HA gene is 97.5%), A/chicken/Guandong/178/2004 (97.3%), and A/duck/Viet Nam/12/2005 (97.2%). The cleavage site of HA\u2014P337QRERRRKRGLF348\u2014contains a multiple basic amino acid motif, which is typical for HPAI but differs from the Qinghai\u2013Siberian HA cleavage site. The 2008 isolates also belong to group Z for internal genes, have avian-type receptor specificity, and are sensitive to M2-channel formation and neuraminidase inhibitors. Nevertheless, in contrast to the HPAI/H5N1/2.2 strains, which contain K627 (an amino acid that promotes virulence in mammalian cells), the Far Eastern 2008 isolates contains E627, typical for avian-adaptive variants. Finally, direct experiments in vitro verified that the 2008 isolates had a reduced tropism for mammalian cell lines.116\n",

Most strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs and had the value W\n3/6<1. These strain had D222 and Q223 in the receptor-binding site of HA1 and usually did not cause any severe complication of the disease, such as pneumonia. The strains with W\n3/6\u22481 were isolated from autopsies of patients who died of primary viral pneumonia.

Despite mountain relief along the lake coast, the delta represents a sandbank wedge overgrown with low reeds where the conditions are conducive to a mass nesting of ducks and a high density of population of muskrats. As a result, there is a high level of interaction between the populations of aquatic birds and muskrats. In particular, A/muskrat/Buryatia/1944/2000 (H4N6) has the highest homology with A/pochard/Buryatia/1903/2000 (H4N6).

Degeneration, necrosis, and further apoptosis, followed by tearing away of the epithelial cell layer take place as a result of the infection. Nevertheless, the main element of Influenza A virus\u2013induced pathogenesis is lesions on the system of vessels; the lesions emerge as the result of the toxic effect of the virus, an effect that includes the multiple formation of active oxygen forms. The latter provoke the generation of hydroperoxides, which interact with lipids and phospholipids of the cell wall to oxidize their peroxide, thereby hindering transport across the cell membrane.217., 218., 219. A subsequent increase in the permeability of vessels, the fragility of their walls, and a violation of the body\u2019s microcirculation result in hemorrhagic manifestations, from nasal bleeding to hemorrhagic hypostasis of the lungs and hemorrhages in the substance of the brain.219., 220. Frustration of the circulation, in turn, defeats the nervous system. The pathomorphological picture is characterized by the existence of lymphomonocytic infiltrates around small and average-size veins, hyperplasia of glial elements, and a focal demyelinization that testifies to the toxic and allergic nature of the pathological process in the CNS during influenza.219., 221., 222.\n",

For example, for avian Influenza A virus variants, there is an obvious threshold in the virulence level: so-called LPAI and HPAI. HPAI strains strike vascular endothelial and perivascular parenchymal cells as well as the cardiovascular system, quickly reproduce high titers in practically all internal organs, and cause systemic disease leading to death of a bird 1\u20137 days after infection. LPAI strains, to the contrary, reproduce in low titers, have a narrow tropism toward mucous in the digestive and respiratory tracts (Figure 8.108\n), and cause enteritis or rhinitis with low mortality. (However, bird diseases connected with LPAI also cause significant damage to agriculture and can break the interspecies barrier, resulting in diseases that are dangerous to people). Wild aquatic and semiaquatic birds, which are natural reservoirs of Influenza A viruses, can have inapparent disease during either LPAI or HPAI infection.5., 24., 27., 28., 39., 41., 42., 43., 53., 226., 228., 229., 230.\n",

Because the homology of the other structural and nonstructural proteins of BKNV and DHOV is 96\u201398%, it can be concluded that BKNV is a variant of DHOV, typical to central Asia and Transcaucasia. A phylogenetic analysis based on a comparison of the PB1 and HA proteins is presented in Figure 8.110, Figure 8.112.",

There is substantial evidence, that, in Africa, wild primates play an important role in the natural transmission cycle, but it is not clear whether infection in primates is incidental to or necessary for the maintenance of the virus. In Uganda, CHIKV was frequently isolated from Aedes africanus mosquitoes, which preferto feed on monkeys in the forest canopy.47 Specific anti-CHIKV antibodies were found among chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in equatorial and savanna forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa)48 and in savannas in southern Africa. Antibodies were found over a wide area in vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and baboons (Pipio ursinus), and in both species the virus could circulate in the blood for two to three days at high concentrations without evidence of illness.49 So, wild animals could play an important role as amplifying hosts.49 CHIKV was isolated in Dakar< Senegal, from bats, which developed viremia after experimental infection. But in India, inoculation of the virus into two species of fruit-eating bats was followed by low virulence.50., 51. Antibodies were found among donkeys, bats, and wild rodents in Africa52 and among domestic animals in Asia.49., 50.\n",

Thus, the medical radiography portrait was consistent with right-side pneumonia with lymphadenopathy. Several peculiarities of the case were the bareness of clinical symptoms (pneumonia was diagnosed only via medical radiography), a rapid progression of changes in the lungs, and the absence of inflammation markers in the peripheral blood. Three days later, positive dynamics were detected: The basal parts of the right lung were restored to their previous level of clarity, although the shadow indicating a hypertrophic lymph node and right root broadening remained.",

The first group comprises strains from tundra and forest\u2013tundra in the Magadan region and the Sakha\u2013Yakutia Republic in the north of Asia. The second group encompasses strains from leaf-bearing forests of Khabarovsk Krai.
