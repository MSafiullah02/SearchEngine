Educators\nacross the world have begun to use technology-based applications or \u201cjust- in-time\u201d instructional strategies to an extent never seen before.\nSuch instructional strategies are intended to implement the curriculum in the absence of a physical classroom. However, they do not emphasize\nthe design of instructional material used in it or the mastery of information by learner per se ( 1\n). The ultimate goal of medical education is to cause changes in behaviour through gaining information. It is vital to understand how the student\u2019s memory\nhandles the information load imposed by online instruction format and extent of information retention.",

When a teacher delivers the lecture via streaming applications such as Zoom Cloud Meeting\u00ae or Google classroom, it is impossible to ascertain the level\nof attention by the student. The allotment of working memory may not be limited to grasping the information conveyed by the teacher, but also to other\nevents happening concurrently in the surrounding environment. The information from a streaming lecture can be channelled into three sub-systems: a) visuo-spatial path, for visual images which are either projected or drawn on the screen,\nb) phonological path, for listening to the verbal information (delivered by the presenter), and c) a buffer system, to integrate both sub-paths\ninto working memory ( 3\n). When the attention of the students gets bifurcated, the integration of sub-paths does not happen. Further, the frequency with which chunks\nof new information are presented also determines the efficacy of information consolidation. Rapid delivery of new information leads to clogging of working memory.",

There is a need to differentiate the instructional elements which have low interactivity compared to those with higher interactivity. For example,\na lecture on anatomical components of basal nuclei has few highly interactive elements. Missing one element will not compromise on the comprehension\nof the other elements. However, a lecture on physiological communications and functional aspects of basal nuclei has many high interactivity\nelements that cannot be omitted. If the teacher omits certain interacting elements in order to make the lecture appear easy, then,\nit may compromise the understanding and impair learning by students. On the contrary, teaching too many essential elements at a stretch would overwhelm\nthe cognitive capacity of the students. One method to overcome this conundrum is to create an effective cognitive schema, where multiple elements are\nseamlessly integrated. Also, allotting adequate time gap between different elements will enable mental rehearsal. Another method to deal with\ntoo many interacting elements in a lecture is to divide the lecture topic into 2-3 smaller segments and test the learning activity by asking\nthe students to draw concept maps or solve multiple-choice questions. Thus, we need to understand that the primary challenge in creating\ncontent for online lectures is to manage the intrinsic load of the instructional formats.",

Even if we consider the content, delivery and material as constant factors, the learning taking place in the conventional classroom-based physical\nenvironment would not be similar to a distance and individual learning environment. The classroom environment, with the presence of teacher and peers,\nis found to have a positive effect on the learner\u2019s willingness to participate in active discussions and motivation ( 9\n). Dowaliby and Schumer ( 10\n) measured the level of the students\u2019 anxiety in learner-centred and teacher-centred environments. They found that students with higher levels of anxiety performed\nbetter in the conventional teacher- centred environment compared to those with lower anxiety who performed better in a learner- centred environment.\nIf we extrapolate this finding to virtual and distance learning, we could see that students with lower levels of anxiety could learn better.",
