For example, SARS is caused by a corona virus for which there is no vaccine. First reported in Asia in February 2003, it spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, containing viable micro-organisms can be released (Jennison 1942) . The smaller droplets quickly evaporate to droplet nuclei, which can suspend in air for a long time and travel considerable distances either in free form or by attaching to other aerosols. Because of droplet encasement, virus infectivity can be shielded from external forces (e.g. drying, sunlight and temperature) (Tyrrell 1967) .",

However, conventional high efficiency filters require high energy consumption (for HVAC system) or breathing exertion (respirators) because of its high pressure drop. Moreover, the surviving micro-organisms collected on the filter can multiply and may be released into the air passing through the filter medium, thus resulting in microbial contamination of the breathing air (Richardson et al. 2006) . Therefore, there have been efforts to incorporate antimicrobial agents into air filters, intended to destroy or inhibit the survival and growth of microorganisms (Foarde and James 2001; Cecchini et al. 2004) .",

Oxidation of sulfhydryl (-SH) groups or substitution onto tyrosine and histidine residues results in the disruption of normal functions of these amino acids (Carroll 1955) .

However, only limited studies have been conducted recently on the disinfection capacity of iodinated resin filters for air treatment (Messier 2004; Heimbuch and Wander 2006; Heimbuch et al. 2007; Eninger et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008; Ratnesar-Shumate et al. 2008) . The previous study in this series (Ratnesar-Shumate et al. 2008 ) -investigating the performance of iodine-treated filters for inert fluorescent particles and vegetative bacterial cells (Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli) -proposed a near-contact transfer mechanism between the iodine-treated filter and micro-organisms penetrating the filter as an inactivation mechanism, but without solid proof. In the current study, a second possible source of inactivation was considered -I 2 released from the filter. I 2 released from the filter could cause inactivation in the sampling device, whereas I 2 captured by micro-organisms passing through the filter could inactivate them in their airborne state and \u2044 or continue the inactivation process after collection in the sampling device, either bound to the particle or by dissolving in the aqueous medium. Identification of inactivation by dissolved I 2 could confound the results in earlier reports (Messier 2004; Heimbuch and Wander 2006; Heimbuch et al. 2007; Eninger et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008; Ratnesar-Shumate et al. 2008 ) that used plating methods to measure viable removal efficiency, which would require an independent experimental method to quantify the relative importance of two competing inactivation mechanisms.",

The virus in the experimental impinger might lose its infectivity because of both the operation of the impinger (e.g. swirling effect and reaerosolization) and the action of I 2 . Meanwhile, the infectivity of viruses in the control impinger will be affected only by the operation of the impinger. Therefore, by comparing the results of the control and the experimental impingers, the loss of virus infectivity by the operation of the impinger was excluded. How I 2 disinfects virus in the impinger was studied by using sodium thiosulfate solution to quench the reactivity of I 2 available in the impinger. The same experimental procedure described previously for sublimation and dissolution of I 2 was followed except that the impinger medium was replaced by a 0AE1-mol l )1 solution of sodium thiosulfate.

The use of thiosulfate solution has a limitation in this exclusion because it can react with both I 2 existing free in the impinger solution and I 2 residing on the MS2. Therefore, a halogen-demanding substance, bovine serum albumin (BSA), was used, which consumes free I 2 in the impinger solution but competes less aggressively than thiosulfate for I 2 on the MS2. The capacity of BSA to consume all of the I 2 released from the filter was predetermined by using the same experimental configuration for sublimation and dissolution of I 2 except that the impinger contained 0AE3%, 3% and 6% BSA and a virus suspension of known concentration. The filtration experiment was then performed using the selected concentration. Viral aerosols were delivered as challenges to the iodine-treated filter and collected in both control and experimental impingers for 1, 5, 10 and 15 mins. The MS2 in the experimental impinger was compared to the penetrating MS2.

The PSD of the aerosols entering the test filters showed its mode at approx. 25 nm. As a baseline, sterile DI water without virus was aerosolized from the nebulizer, and the PSD of that was measured, defining the background noise. Therefore, the PSD of the aerosols above the noise level in the window from 9AE82 to 162AE5 nm was considered for the calculation. The PREs (mean \u00b1 SD) of the iodine-treated and untreated filters for this size range were 41 \u00b1 3% and 39 \u00b1 2% respectively. Statistical evaluation of the two values by a onetailed student's t-test indicated that the difference was insignificant (P-value > 0AE05). The initial pressure drop of the test filters was around 50-100 Pa, and the variation in pressure drop during the entire experiment was negligible. This value is much less than the inhalation and exhalation resistances of the respirator certified by NIOSH, which cannot exceed 343 and 196 Pa respectively (CFR 2002) . No significant difference in the pressure drop between the iodine-treated and untreated filters was observed.",

At HT \u2044 LRH, a significantly higher value of the iodinetreated filter than the other conditions was observed, according to one-way anova (P-value < 0AE05), because of the increased release of I 2 from the filter. Meanwhile, the difference between RT \u2044 LRH and RT \u2044 MRH was not significant (P-value > 0AE05), indicating that the release of HOI into air because of the hydrolysis of I 2 at increased RH is negligible.",

As shown in Table 2 , no surviving virus was detected in the experimental impinger until >10 4 PFU in the PBS was added to the impingers. As the virus concentration in the impinger increased, the number of surviving viruses also increased. Meanwhile, the survival fraction of viruses in the thiosulfate solution was much higher than that in the PBS. Most viruses suspended in the thiosulfate solution survived in the experimental impinger because of the quenching by reaction with thiosulfate of the I 2 released from the iodine-treated filter and \u2044 or transferred I 2 to viral aerosols. Hatch et al. (1980) proposed spontaneous dissociation of I 2 from the polyiodide-resin complex as one of three possible inactivation mechanisms of their iodinated resin filter in water treatment. In another study (Marchin et al. 1983) , acquisition of I 2 by a cyst during passage through an iodinated resin column was hypothesized. The authors observed that cysts regained viability because of the reduction of I 2 by thiosulfate solution for up to 3 min. A more recent study (Brion and Silverstein 1999) reported reversal of MS2 inactivation after a few minutes (<5 min) of iodine treatment by adding 0AE3% BSA. It must be noted that these studies were performed in water, so their applicability to inactivation mechanisms of iodine in air treatment is uncertain.",

The distinguishable increase of surviving MS2 at 10 mins of collection time parallels a delayed reactivation of MS2 observed in aqueous iodine solutions (Brion and Silverstein 1999) , and it is tempting to conclude that the deactivation processes in water and in this system are similar after iodine has been transferred to the virion. However, some combination of direct transfer of I 2 from the filter plus dissociation of I 2 from weaker binding sites on penetrating particles reproduces their general conditions and appears to cause almost half the observed inactivation of viral aerosols penetrating the iodine-treated filter and collected in PBS medium. After submission of this manuscript, Triosyn Corp. (P.J. Messier, 2009 , unpublished data) disclosed data showing a threshold for inactivation of MS2 and of Staphylococcus aureus at 0AE5$0AE6 ppm I 2 in PBS medium, which is consistent with results presented herein and defines a boundary condition to anticipate significant interference by dissolved iodine. We then verified that the data reported by Heimbuch and Wander (2006) and by Heimbuch et al. (2007) were measured under conditions that inactivation by free I 2 did not contribute significantly. Eninger et al. (2008) collected MS2 aerosols penetrating an iodinated medium into gelatin-coated plates, which they washed out into water and plated in a plaque assay. They observed no kill of MS2 and concluded that the treatment was ineffective. However, their observation of no inactivation by iodine during the steps of their workup that were executed in water shows clearly that the overwhelming excess of protein in their collection surface consumed all of the iodine displaced, released or captured from the iodinated medium. Whereas their experiment thus does not support the conclusion that the treatment is inactive, in the absence of measurements of I 2 concentrations in the impingers, we can make no quantitative statement about the relative importance in our dataset of these potentially competing processes for inactivation. However, we note that, even though sufficient I 2 is released to confound the environment in the impingers, the airborne concentration of I 2 released from the filter was much less than the 8-h time weighted average-threshold limit value of 1 mg m )3 , the level below which a worker is expected to have no adverse health effect resulting from chronic exposure (OSHA 2000; Di Ionno and Messier 2004) . Hence, whatever activity is present is realistically available for use in respiratory protection.",

The corrected values were determined by dividing the observed values by the survival fraction (0AE17) to consider the effects of free I 2 . As shown, no significant difference in the corrected extracted fraction between iodine-treated and untreated filters at the same environmental condition was exhibited (P-value > 0AE05). Both iodine-treated and untreated filters tested at MRH showed the lowest value among the survival fractions presumably because of the sensitivity of MS2 to the MRH (Dubovi and Akers 1970) . The lower values of free I 2 from the iodine-treated filter tested at HT \u2044 LRH and RT \u2044 MRH than that at RT \u2044 LRH indicate measurable loss of I 2 from the iodine-treated filter.

The PRE was measured for ultrafine particles (i.e. 9AE82-162AE5 nm), whereas the VRE was measured over the entire particle size range generated from the nebulizer. Even if the PRE for the entire particle size range is calculated by particle counting, its value will still be different from the VRE because of aggregation of virus aerosols and fewer counts of viable virus available for disaggregation in smaller particles than in bigger particles. A viral aggregate is measured by the particle counter as one particle, but it can be assayed as several viruses after collection in the impinger because of dispersion in the collection medium. The number of viable viruses in a big particle is larger than that in an ultrafine particle; thus, the contribution of larger particles collected in the impingers to the infectivity results will be much greater than that of ultrafine particles.

Berg et al.

They mentioned a lagged deactivation curve of iodine because of virus clumping and the necessity of time for virus clumping to be separated.

High retention capability of the electret test filter can be a reason for the low extracted fraction caused by the electrostatic attraction between viral particles and filter media. In the same context, insignificant reaerosolization of the viruses from the test filters is expected. It should be noted that both iodine-treated and untreated filters presumably have similar retention of viruses. In the test filters, the negatively charged surface of viruses is influenced by an attractive force with the positive resin surface and repulsive force caused by negatively charged functional groups on the filter medium. This property of the test filter implies that a filter medium that is depleted of I 2 over time can still serve as an effective medium for trapping viruses, because it has the same attractive and repulsive forces as the untreated filter -the resin surface and by-product iodide ions remain after consumption of the iodine molecules from the triiodide ions. The effect of iodine on the infectivity of MS2 collected on the iodine-treated filter is less certain than previously thought, because similar viable recoveries were observed for the iodine-treated and untreated filters; however, a strong virucidal effect of I 2 was observed in both the VRE of the iodine-treated filter and free I 2 residual experiments. This phenomenon can be explained by two possible reasons: (i) shielding effect of aggregated particles collected on the filter and (ii) high retention capability of the test filters.",

However, toxicity of iodine dissolved in the collection medium is likely to be a competing mechanism in warm environments, and the relative importance of each must be determined -or at least factored into the design and analysis processes -at different conditions. Data from a different experimental approach might not encounter this uncertainty, and the assay is only a surrogate for the goal of the technology, enhancing respiratory protection against bioaerosol transmission of pathogens. Both the medium in the impinger and the protein gel have elements in common with respiratory mucosa, and for a person wearing individual protective gear, the time of transit from filter to mucosal surface is similar. However, competition by water and by proteins at the site of impaction might or might not behave the same as in the in vitro systems tested to date.
