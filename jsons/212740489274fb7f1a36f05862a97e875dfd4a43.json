The warning messages reminded further measurements by ear thermometers. A total of 149 healthcare professionals, 75 suspected/confirmed patients and 63 college students in quarantine wear the HEARThermo. The data efficiency retrieved by the HEARThermo ranged from 33-70%, and suspected patients retrieved highest data (70%), followed by healthcare professionals (45%). Only three healthcare professional and nine patients had fever. Body surface temperature of the patient on January 25, 2020 was shown in figure 1. The HEARThermo, as a wearable physiological monitor for remotely monitoring the health status of people under risk of infection, provides real-time data and decision support for healthcare providers and public health agencies. Our data suggest the application the innovative wearable device in continuous monitoring of body temperature with heart rate variation may be a solution in provision of early detection and point-of-care for suspected cases, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
