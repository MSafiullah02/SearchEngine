The age at onset of inflammatory symptoms varies, even between affected siblings,2 indicating that additional factors are required.

However, since patients were not enrolled in a formal protocol, we did not have definite information, whether all microbiological studies had been performed. Assuming that some of the investigations were incomplete, we performed an additional search for viruses using biomaterial stored at the time of HLH diagnosis. The patients are part of a cohort of 87 patients with 1\u00b0 HLH recruited between 2008 and 2014.7 Of these, 12 (8% of 61 patients < 2 years and 27% of 26 patients > 2 years) had a documented infection at the time of HLH manifestation, 11 viral infections and one periungual S. aureus infection. In 26 of the remaining 75 patients, we had access to biomaterial (7 FHL2, 12 FHL3, and 7 FHL5). Age at onset was < 2 years in 23 patients. Informed consent was obtained (University of Freiburg IRB 143/12; 40/08). We isolated DNA and RNA from the pelleted blood cell fraction remaining after Ficoll separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the initial diagnostic sample. Real\u2010time PCR was performed for EBV, CMV, herpes simplex virus 1+2 (HSV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parechoviruses, adenovirus, parvovirus, and BK polyomavirus using commercial kits. As quality control, we included PCRs for torque teno virus (TTV) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV), two persisting DNA viruses thought to be prevalent in 20%\u201340% of children aged 2\u20134 years8 and glyceraldehyde 3\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a positive control. Assuming that local mucosal infections could disseminate in cytotoxicity\u2010deficient patients under HLH conditions, we also performed multiplexed nucleic acid tests for gastrointestinal pathogens and respiratory viruses. We validated the methodology by investigating 3 patients with EBV, CMV, and HSV\u20101\u2013associated 2\u00b0 HLH, where the initially detected virus could also be found in the stored biomaterial. Analysis of the 26 FHL samples revealed TTV and TTMV at the expected frequency. Additionally, CMV was identified in 2 patients. Notably, in the 24 remaining FHL patients, all PCR results remained negative (Table 1).",

            "text": "This report focuses on the question of whether HLH manifestation in FHL patients always requires an infectious trigger. We report on two patient cohorts with primary HLH with a low incidence of infections. Obviously, some limitations require discussion. In the first cohort, the analysis was restricted to viral DNA or RNA isolated from a blood fraction that is not standard for virus detection. Although we could detect EBV, CMV, HSV, TTV, and TTMV in high copy numbers in this material, we could not validate all of the viruses tested in our study, in particular viruses with replication restricted to mucosal sites. Also, viruses may have initiated the immune reaction, but already been eliminated at the time of blood sampling. In addition, unknown viruses or organisms other than viruses causing localized or systemic infections were not covered in our panel. On the other hand, the infection rate of 16% (14/87) was similar to the 19% (32/168) observed in a recent report.10 Higher rates ranging from 28% (5/18)4 to 42% (25/60)11 up to 81% (13/16)5 had been reported earlier, but in these studies, 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 HLH could not be readily differentiated. It is also notable that in our cohort the immunosuppressive HLH therapy did not lead to secondary emergence of a pathogen in the FHL infants presenting without apparent trigger. In the second cohort, although an infection was the key initial differential diagnosis and extensive investigations for neonatal infections were therefore performed, the lack of standardized testing represents a limitation. Furthermore commensal bacteria or viruses that escaped awareness of the physician may become pathogenic in immunodeficient patients. Also, exposure to bacteria or transplacental transmission of pathogens could have triggered HLH in these infants without causing infectious illness. However, the fact that not a single case was reported with an associated infection challenges the concept that HLH manifestations in FHL patients may always require an overt infection.",

            "text": "Therefore, we propose that besides infections other triggers should also be considered in primary HLH. This is further supported by the observation of isolated central nervous system (CNS) HLH without detectable trigger in FHL patients (M. Heeg, unpublished), where HLH appears to be initiated in a primarily sterile compartment. We speculate that noninfectious triggers provoking tissue damage, the associated danger signals or even developmental processes in the fetus that require expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes could be sufficient to initiate the immune activation. The occasional association of disease onset with vaccination supports these possibilities. However, it is difficult to envisage how such moderate localized and transient stimuli can result in systemic polyclonal activation of up to 80% of all T cells.12 In perforin\u2010deficient mice, at least the large majority of hyperactivated T cells is specific for the triggering virus.13 The specificity of these T cells in human patients remains an enigma. Understanding their specificity might help to further elucidate the pathogenesis of HLH. The unique amplification of cytotoxic (HLA\u2010DR+ CD127\u2212PD1+ CD57+ perforin+) CD4+ T cells observed in 1\u00b0, but not in virus\u2010induced 2\u00b0 HLH may provide additional clues.12\n",

This puts lymphocyte cytotoxicity to the center of immune regulation and maintenance of T\u2010cell quiescence, far beyond its activity in virus control. A better understanding of the initiation of immune reactions in HLH and the role of perforin and the secretory pathway in controlling them will therefore be highly relevant for understanding the regulation of human immune responses. Ultimately, it will also provide insights relevant for prophylaxis and intervention in this life\u2010threatening disease.",
