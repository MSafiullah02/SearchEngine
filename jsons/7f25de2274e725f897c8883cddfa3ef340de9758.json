The focus is how to get the most valuable and actionable information out of data -models that translate data into evidence for policy. Transmission dynamic modelling is now central to designing and evaluating public health interventions against infectious diseases, especially for intervention programmes. Who should we vaccinate? Should we close schools to limit spread? What vector control option will save the most lives? These questions, if they are to be answered rationally, need a way of predicting the impact in terms of health outcome, e.g. numbers of clinical cases or deaths averted. Policy questions determine the necessary components and the complexity of the model; models need to be simple enough to analyse, but sufficiently detailed to address the questions.",

Early papers were content to try to understand the observed patterns: Kermack and McKendrick's finding that \"an epidemic, in general, comes to an end, before the susceptible population has been exhausted\" was derived from first principles in order to explain the observations from data on a cholera epidemic in Bombay, India (Kermack et al., 1927) . As the data become more complete and more detailed, the methods of analysis and fitting the model to data become more complex; and it is this that has substantially changed in the last 20 years of infectious disease modelling. Kermack and McKendrick's SIR model from 1927 is still the archetypal virus model, but there have been many additions to this simple model, to test the utility of control strategies (Keeling and Gilligan, 2000) and to account for known biases in the data (Finger et al., 2018 , as one of many examples). This field has been rapidly developing, but is maturing as some of the core ideas become fixed. The purpose of this Special Issue on methods for infectious disease analysis is to act as both a marker in time of where the subject is, and as a way into the literature and techniques for those new to the area. Each paper takes one approach or technique (a 'tool'), typically associated with a particular software platform, and leads the reader from the basic idea into the darker reaches. We have asked the authors to develop specific, relevant examples and we recommend that the reader work through the code and run the examples: it is impossible to learn to swim without getting wet. The first paper describes and provides an overview of the available infectious disease models and a suggested criteria for selecting a specific model (see Box 1).",

With this respect three early 20th century studies can be considered as the founding of disease dynamics: Ross's work on malaria transmission (Ross, 1911) , McKendrick and Kermack's paper (Kermack et al., 1927) and Reed-Frost's chain binomial model (presented in 1928 but not published at the time) (Lessler and Cummings, 2016) .",

            "text": "A major step-change in the use of models to understand infectious diseases was apparent in the late 70's and early 80's where investigation began in full-swing in both the UK and the USA. These developments were motivated by understanding both the chronic effects of persistent parasite infection (for example hookworm), the regularity of viral epidemics such as 'flu and measles, the emergence of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, and the initiation of large vaccination programmes (Agur et al., 1993; Anderson and May, 1985; Elveback et al., 1976; Grenfell and Anderson, 1989; Longini et al., 1984; May and Anderson, 1987) . Whilst most modelling studies emerged from a small number of research groups, there are some notable exceptions (e.g. (Baroyan, 1963) for influenza in the USSR). Although the development of models in order to support policy making was well underway at the end of the 1980s, it was only later, with the emergence of affordable computational power following the advent of personal computers and the increasing availability of digital data, that effective tools to were developed or borrowed from other fields. This period ends about 1993 marked by the publication of Anderson & May (1993) and the series of meetings at the Newton Institute (Grenfell et al., 1995; Medley and Isham, 1996) . Heesterbeek's thesis titled R0 and his notable seminar style in which he filled a blackboard with equations, marks the last point at which infectious disease modelling could be done on paper alone (Heesterbeek, 1992) . The publications from those meetings are now notable by their lack of statistical innovation, and the apparent paucity of data.",

These methods, now referred to as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to approximate the posterior distribution has provided an incredibly useful and simple iterative method. It is particularly useful inside the Bayesian framework, but also any situation where a probability distribution can be derived by linking the data and the parameters of the model. It provides a way of exploring the parameter space and obtaining representative samples of the parameters compatible with the target distributions. We assume in this special issue that the essentials of MCMC are known. Readers who might want to look for more information in implementing MCMC can refer to (Gilks et al., 1996; van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2018) . As the field of mathematical modelling for infectious diseases has expanded, so has the complexity of models and their relation to data. Specific policy questions have triggered the need for including new layers of heterogeneity and complexity to existing models. A notable example of this type of change is the inclusion of the age structure within transmission models using contact surveys (Mossong et al., 2008) . This increase in model complexity has been driven by an improvement in understanding transmission; in the example by Mossong it has been the importance of age-structure in driving transmission of infectious diseases (in this case 'flu). Without including this model complexity, predictions in the effectiveness of interventions would be incorrect.",

Its first use in infectious disease modelling were (Dureau et al., 2013) and is becoming an increasingly popular choice as a fitting method for highly complex models where states are not directly observable. However the development of this method has been hindered by the potentially complex mathematical background behind it, in particular in terms of the multiple indexes necessary to write the algorithms.

One of the most fundamental is the \"closed population\", which only exist in very special circumstances such as boarding schools and isolated populations (Keeling and Grenfell, 1997) . But people (and nonhuman hosts) move. An important problem at the time of writing is the emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus , initially in Wuhan, China (Riou and Althaus, 2020) . As well as the need to rapidly understand the natural history of infection of this new virus, it is essential to understand how population movement will impact spread. An important part of the data revolution is the increasing ease with which we can collect geostatistical information; it is increasingly common to use flight data to estimate patterns of emergence and associate an individual with a precise J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and temporally changing spatial location, utilising GPS devices and smartphones (Wesolowski et al., 2015) . The analysis of infectious disease spread in geographical space and time is an area requiring more attention. The paper by Milton et al. (see Box 6, (Milton et al., 2019) ) is different from the others in the issue in that the dynamics are not at the centre of attention, but this approach represents one of our bets for the future. Infectious disease dynamics drive spatio-temporal statistical patterns on an aggregate level, providing an alternative angle for inference when strong assumptions on the transmission process cannot be justified.

The arrival of Bayesian analysis Using Gibbs Sampling (BUGS) in the early 90s as a user-friendly software for implementing MCMC brought Bayesian analysis to the mainstream and spurred a revolution in infectious disease modelling. BUGS remains a widely used tool for analysing data including from the perspective of infectious disease models (see Box 2 andAuzenbergs et. al. (2019) in this issue). The use of the BUGS language for fitting J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f complex models gained popularity in many areas of infectious disease research, but some challenges to using SIR-like models prevented their widespread use, such as the acyclic nature of non-linear models. Until MCMC samplers became easier to write, and researchers skills in computational methods improved enough to write them, a second revolution was required in methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology.Second Revolution: adding complexity and heterogeneity(early 2000spresent)",

            "text": "). Fortunately, advances in computational capabilities, as well as advances in tools and software packages available have allowed for these developments. Infectious disease modellers now require skills in coding (often in several languages) and statistical inference, as well as an ability to manipulate and solve equations. However, with increasing model complexity, statistical inference becomes challenging and sometimes a distraction from the objectives of the analysis (ie. to capture the dynamics of infection through a population). Fortunately, shortcuts have been made increasingly available, such as packages to borrow inference from elsewhere and approximating the full likelihood, which has been helped by the sharing of code to complement equations within the papers. The increasing use of R and python software by researchers has also been transformational, as the software is relatively accessible and the use of libraries of additional code and wrappers to use other languages enable a rapid progression to carry out infectious disease modelling. To this end, several of the papers within this Special Edition make use of R libraries and various wrappers that port other languages into R(Auzenbergs et al., 2019;Chatzilena et al., 2019;Funk and King, 2020), making modelling more accessible.A particularly useful development has been Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) which can be used where the likelihood of a model is intractable. Whilst ideas related to this method have been circulating since at least the 1980s, only in the late",
