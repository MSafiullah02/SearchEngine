L. pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium, which is found ubiquitously in the environment as a parasite of protozoa (Fields 1996). It is considered an accidental opportunistic human pathogen, because it can cause disease in immunocompromised individuals, but cannot be transmitted between individuals (Yu et al. 1983; Fields 1996; Shin 2012). One of the major virulence factors of L. pneumophila is a type IVB secretion system, called Dot/Icm, which delivers a large number of bacterial proteins into the host cell (Marra et al. 1992; Berger and Isberg 1993; Segal, Purcell and Shuman 1998; Vogel et al. 1998). The delivered proteins, termed effectors, target specific cellular processes in the host cell, resulting in altered trafficking of the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole, and promoting the survival and replication of the bacterium inside the modified vacuole (Horwitz 1983; Isberg, O'Connor and Heidtman 2009).",

            "text": "The transport mechanism of the Dot/Icm secretion system is not well understood, with limited structural data available (Kubori et al. 2014), and largely undefined substrate selectivity (Nagai et al. 2005; Burstein et al. 2009). One of the Dot/Icm components, DotK/IcmN, has been implicated in playing a role as a cell-wall anchor of the Dot/Icm secretion system through the binding to peptidoglycan (Nagai and Kubori 2011). The DotK/IcmN protein is one of six L. pneumophila proteins containing the domain called OmpA-like, or OmpA-C-like, annotated as Pfam F00691 (Finn et al. 2013). The OmpA-like protein domain denotes homology to the C-terminal portion of the canonical Escherichia coli outer membrane porin OmpA. Proteins containing an OmpA-like domain are predicted to bind to peptidoglycan at the cell wall, and are important for the virulence of a number of intracellular pathogens, including Francisella tularensis (Mahawar et al. 2012), Leptospira interrogans (Ristow et al. 2007) and Coxiella brunetii (Martinez et al. 2014). Of the six L. pneumophila proteins containing an OmpA-like domain, the best studied is DotK/IcmN, which is encoded within one of the two dot/icm loci. The dotK/icmN gene is dispensable for intracellular replication within human macrophages, but is partially required during replication in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii (Segal and Shuman 1999). Three other OmpA-like proteins are predicted to function as structural components of the flagella: MotB, MotD and Lpg2962. The lipoprotein Ppl/PAL is a surface exposed protein (Ludwig et al. 1991; Hoffman, Ripley and Weeratna 1992), and has been explored as a possible diagnostic tool, as it can be detected in the urine of patients with Legionnaires\u2019 disease (Kim et al. 2003; Gholipour et al. 2014). Finally, the OmpA-like protein that is encoded by open reading frame Lpg0657 is a highly conserved protein within the Legionella genus, but has not been studied to date. Here we set out to characterize the potential role of the Lpg0657 OmpA-like protein in the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila. We find that the Lpg0657 protein, which we renamed CmpA, is required for efficient intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in both the protozoan host A. castellanii and in primary murine macrophages, but not in broth. The importance of the CmpA protein may be in part due to its contribution to bacterial uptake into host cells.",

In detail, A. castellanii was plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 and infected with a 1:1 mixture of the competing strains at an overall multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.25. After 2 h, all wells were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. Initial uptake was determined by processing wells immediately following the wash step to determine the number of colony-forming units (CFU). Every 3 days supernatant was collected and combined with cell lysate from the same well. Bacteria were then plated for CFU enumeration, and diluted 1:1000 and used to re-infect a fresh batch of cells. For differential enumeration of the two strains, bacteria were plated on both plain CYE and CYE-containing kanamycin.",

Efforts to generate a deletion mutant that lacks the entire coding sequence of the cmpA gene have repeatedly and consistently resulted in 100% of the intermediate merodiploid clones resolving back into the wild-type genotype, rather than a knockout genotype. We opted instead to use a transposon mutant from a partially sequenced mariner minitransposon (Murata et al. 2006) mutant library. Sequencing showed that the cmpA gene was interrupted at nucleotide 262 downstream of the start site of the gene (illustrated in Fig. 2A). The transposon mutant was transferred to a fresh background using methods previously described (Murata et al. 2006), and the genotype was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 2B), using primers that flank the transposon insertion site (Fig. 2A). A complementation strain was constructed by introducing an expression vector into the cmpA mutant, where expression of the Flag-CmpA fusion protein is driven by an IPTG-inducible promoter. Immunoblot analysis of the complemented strain shows that the expression of the Flag-CmpA fusion protein is strongly regulated by IPTG, with no signal detected in samples from cells that were not induced by IPTG (Fig. 2C).",

To test this, we examined the ability of the cmpA mutant to grow in broth. Our results show that cmpA can replicate as well as an isogenic wild-type strain in liquid growth media, showing similar growth kinetics as the wild type (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). To examine the effect of a mutation in cmpA on the ability of L. pneumophila to infect host cells, and replicate within the cells, a quantitative intracellular growth assay was performed. The results clearly demonstrate that the cmpA mutant has an intracellular growth defect. In the protozoan host A. castellanii, growth at 72 h after infection was more than 10 times lower than that observed in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained using primary bone marrow-derived murine macrophages, where 72 h after infection the mutant reached CFU numbers that were roughly two orders of magnitude below those of the wild type (Fig. 3B). In both hosts tested, the dotA mutant, lacking an essential component of the Dot/Icm secretion system, serves as a negative control. The dotA mutant failed to replicate in both macrophages and protozoa, demonstrating that at the conditions used in the assay, host cells are able to successfully restrict bacterial replication, and replication is only observed in strains that have a functional Dot/Icm virulence system (Fig. 3A and B). Importantly, the defect observed in the cmpA mutant was fully complemented by adding the cmpA gene in trans using a plasmid encoding for a Flag-CmpA fusion protein under the control of the IPTG-inducible promoter Ptac. Complementation was observed in both protozoa and mammalian cells (Fig. 3A and B). The complementation data demonstrates that the defect observed in the cmpA mutant is a result of the interruption of the cmpA gene, and not a result of a potential polar effect, or another mutation elsewhere in the genome. To further evaluate the impact of cmpA on the fitness of L. pneumophila during infection of host cells, a competition assay between the cmpA mutant and the isogenic wild-type strain was conducted. The results show that when the two strains were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 and used to initiate an infection in the protozoa A. castellanii, the wild type quickly outcompeted the cmpA strain and 3 days after the initiation of the infection, wild type is the only strain recovered from the infected protozoan culture (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the cmpA mutant has a significant disadvantage during an intracellular infection.",

None of the other L. pneumophila proteins containing the OmpA-like domain are predicted to span the inner membrane twice; therefore, CmpA is likely to have a structure and a function that are distinct from those of the other L. pneumophila OmpA-like proteins.",

Interestingly, we found that not only does the cmpA mutant not display a defect growing in the presence of salt, but growth of this mutant was actually better than that of the wild type under high-salt conditions (Fig. 4). Salt resistance in L. pneumophila has been strongly correlated with mutations in the Dot/Icm secretion system (Vogel, Roy and Isberg 1996), presumably due to decreased leakiness of the Dot/Icm system in these mutants. The cmpA mutant shows an intermediate salt resistance phenotype, with resistance that is higher than that seen in the wild type, but lower than that observed for the dotA mutant. This data suggest that the CmpA protein may interact with the Dot/Icm secretion system, or with another transport apparatus, contributing to the overall flow through that system. For example, CmpA could function as part of a larger complex, and may help anchor that complex to the cell wall, similar to Escherichia coli MotB (DeRosier 1998), which also contains an OmpA-like domain and several transmembrane helices.",

A polar effect could result in deregulation of another gene causing either reduced expression or overexpression of that gene, and suggests that the cmpA gene may be encoded as part of an operon. To exclude the possibility of a polar effect in the transposon mutant studied here, a complementation vector was used for the expression of CmpA under the control of the Ptac-inducible promoter. Both the intracellular growth defects and the uptake defect seen with the cmpA transposon mutant were completely restored upon complementation in trans. These results demonstrate that the phenotypes observed for the cmpA mutant are a result of the disruption of the cmpA gene, and not a result of a polar effect on other genes, or the effect of another mutation elsewhere in the genome.",

The cmpA gene encodes for a protein 249 amino acids in length. Two putative transmembrane domains are depicted as gray rectangles marked TM1 and TM2, predicted using both TMpred (Hofmann and Stoffel 1993) and the SMART database (Letunic, Doerks and Bork 2012). TM1 ranges between amino acids 29 and 47, and TM2 ranges between amino acids 76 and 98. The SMART database also predicts the presence of two additional domains, defined by the Pfam database (Finn et al. 2013). A glycine zipper domain, Pfam PF13488, is predicted at amino acid range 61\u2013103 and portrayed by a white rectangle encompassing TM2. The OmpA-like domain, Pfam PF00691, ranges between amino acids 132 and 228 and is represented by a black rectangle. The length and location of the different domains are shown to scale, with the ruler at the bottom marking residue numbers. (B) Multiple sequence alignment of all six C-OmpA-like proteins found in L. pneumophila. Sequence alignment was performed using the T-Coffee server (Notredame, Higgins and Heringa 2000; Wallace et al. 2006) and color coded for degree of homology with pink denoting strong homology, as shown in the key. The C-OmpA-like region is highly conserved among all six proteins.",
