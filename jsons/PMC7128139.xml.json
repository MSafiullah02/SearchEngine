            "text": "In 2017, bezlotoxumab became the second monoclonal antibody authorized for use throughout the European Economic Area directed against an infectious agent. It targets Clostridium difficile toxin B, and as such aims to prevent recurrences of the infection in adults at high risk of repeated bouts [1]. This follows a much earlier EU regulatory approval of palivizumab (in 1999), which is administered to prevent serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for the disease [2]. Licensing of these two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), nearly two decades apart, illustrates the gap to date in clinical development of this therapeutic tool against infections. This is consistent with the experience of other regulatory authorities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which granted similarly phrased labels in the United States for both products [3], [4]. Additionally, the FDA recently licensed ibalizumab as a rescue therapy in heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection and also previously approved raxibacumab (in 2012) and obiltoxaximab (in 2016), both intended for treatment of inhalational anthrax (in combination with appropriate antibacterial medicines) and for prophylaxis when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate [5], [6], [7]. The latter two products were assessed by FDA according to its \u2018Animal Rule,\u2019 largely relying on efficacy data generated in a relevant animal model [8], [9], [10]. In general, the use of mAbs is viewed as an attractive biodefense measure, countering deliberate threats [11]. The technology platform may also offer a rapid protection against newly emerging and reemerging infectious agents when no other treatment or prophylaxis is available. Witness to this, for example, is the ongoing research in mAbs to treat patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome [12]. The experimental use of a tobacco plant\u2013derived mixture of mAbs (ZMapp) during an Ebola virus disease outbreak in western Africa provides an additional example in this respect [13], [14].",

These sera are typically administered when rapid protection is required, following known exposure in an unvaccinated individual (or vaccination is nonexistent) or when previously acquired immunity has waned. As with hyperimmune sera, mAbs can be deployed irrespective of preexisting immune protection status and equally may benefit the immunocompromised host [17], [18]. However, they avoid some of the disadvantages attributed to sera derived immunoglobulins, such as potential (exceedingly low) transmission of infectious hazards and batch variability [19].",

The first licensed monoclonal antibody, OKT3, indicated to prevent acute kidney transplant rejection, used a murine hybridoma technique [20], [21]. Early commercial successes with mAbs were limited, however, by the availability of suitable myeloma cell lines. Also, occurrence of adverse immune reactions, by provoking a human anti-mouse antibody response, is a recognized setback for use of the technique. To limit such unwanted effects whilst also enhancing effector function, chimeric (mouse\u2013human) antibodies first replaced murine hybridomas and more recently humanized (i.e. antibody structure containing less than 10% nonhuman sequences) and fully human mAbs have been developed [19], [21]. New expression tools became available, such as phage display libraries, transgenic mice, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-based biomanufacturing and highly scalable plant technology, as well as the possibility to produce mAbs using human B cells isolated from subjects in convalescence or after vaccination [22], [23], [24], [25].",

            "text": "Thus, current methods have made production more efficient, and importantly, the use of human and humanized mAbs poses fewer safety concerns as opposed to older techniques and serum therapy [19], [26]. With exquisite specificity being the hallmark, mAbs generally harbour a low potential for off-target adverse reactions [27], although it makes them vulnerable to escape mutants, potentially rendering this therapeutic measure ineffective [28]. Hence, this drawback justifies the development of mAbs cocktails, with the antibody constituents binding to different epitopes [27], [29]. Also, alternative antibody formats have been engineered, simultaneously addressing different targets involved in pathophysiologic processes. As such, bispecific antibodies aim to ensure enhanced potency and breadth of protection [30], [31], [32]. Other developments include antigen-binding (Fab) fragments, single chain variable fragments (ScFv) and pairs linked in different ways, as to create formats combining optimal size, half-life, activity and safety [25], [33], as well as novel delivery systems such as antibody\u2013antimicrobial conjugates and radioimmunoconjugates [34], [35]. Effector functions can be modified: Fc domain changes may enhance the affinity to Fc receptors on phagocytic cells, NK cells and B cells, and hence enforce antibody-dependent killing, whilst mutations leading to increased binding affinity for neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) contribute to an extended half-life of the antibody [25].",

To date, promising results to that effect have been shown in animal models [40], [41]. Further on, antibody administration is expected to provide less selective pressure for cross-resistance and may preserve the gut microflora [34], [42]\u2014an important consideration in view of our expanding knowledge on the role of the human gut microbiome in both health and disease [43]. Nevertheless, the success for a wide introduction of mAbs in treating established bacterial infections will be largely dependent on ready and specific pathogen identification.

For example, in the face of periodic outbreaks of diphtheria in various world regions, a global short supply of equine diphtheria antitoxin provides new impetus in developing a suitable monoclonal antibody alternative [56]. So far, though, activities have been most advanced in respect to rabies, for which at least two different products are considered [19]. For one of these, a single human monoclonal antibody (SII-RMAb), a recently completed noninferiority controlled trial concluded it as a potential safe and potent alternative to human rabies immunoglobulin-containing postexposure prophylaxis regimen [57].",

For instance, proper selection of bacterial targets remains fraught with uncertainties: highly conserved outer membrane proteins may be masked and hence unavailable for binding with antibodies; conversely, epitopes located on exopolysaccharides are typically not conserved (i.e. different serotypes exist), posing limitations to the effectiveness of a targeting single monoclonal antibody [34]. Moreover, bacterial defence mechanisms developed in response to host immunoglobulins (e.g. production of antibody degrading proteinases) can impede the success of antibody-based therapy. For viral infections, a single lasting treatment is hampered in the face of multiple strains, rapid evolution and selection of escape mutants [36]. In addition, for some pathogens, viraemia often peaks before appearance of symptoms [58], [59]. In these circumstances, rapid point-of-care diagnostics may be fundamental to the success of the intervention, allowing prompt therapy initiation in those most at risk of developing serious illness [36], [60].",

Indeed, a small number of patients and unpredictable outbreak dynamics may impede the conduct of confirmatory controlled clinical trials. Also, human challenge studies can provide supportive evidence of protection for only a limited number of conditions [61], [62]. In the absence of adequate risk mitigation, such an approach is not expected to be feasible for most of the emerging infections [63], [64]. Alternatively, however, for those threats lacking sustained human-to-human transmission, assessment could be based mainly on data obtained from animal challenge studies and on pharmacokinetic/safety evaluation of the product in healthy volunteers, on the condition that animal models can be established that are sufficiently representative of human disease [8], [65]. The availability of protocols to test the effectiveness and safety of the therapeutic in the field at the time of an outbreak would then probably constitute a condition to the licensing.",

Uncertainties remain\u2014for instance, in selecting appropriate trial endpoints and delineating populations best suited to the intervention [16]. Additionally, development is constrained by high investment expenses amidst unsure future returns. Appropriate pricing is considered a prerequisite for market success, and hence increased streamlining, optimization and innovative processes (e.g. Quality-by-Design) may exert downward pressure on costs. Moreover, research into new delivery methods should be expanded and intensified, ensuring convenient administration to a large number of people. This may entail the development of novel intramuscular and inhalation formulations. In this respect, DNA plasmid-delivered mAbs produced by muscle cells in vivo are singled out as a potential way to circumvent some of the limitations in immunoglobulin G administration [66]. Next-generation mAbs might offer further opportunities, even allowing a single product to target multiple pathogens [67], [68]. From a regulatory viewpoint, tools are available in the European Union to ensure a swift evaluation process and early access to the market, including specific scientific guidance or dedicated advice to companies (Table 1\n) [69]. In this regard, obtaining and complying with European Medicines Agency's scientific advice has shown to be predictive of regulatory success [70].",
