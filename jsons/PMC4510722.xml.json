TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectivity dose) was calculated using the Spearman-Karber method14. The TZM-bl indicator cell line is a HeLa cell derivative that expresses high levels of CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4. Cells contain HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) and firefly luciferase reporter cassettes that are activated by HIV infection and subsequent Tat protein expression. Blue-stained HIV-infected cells expressing \u03b2-gal can thus be quantified and compared with uninfected cells.",

The function of HIV protease is to cleave newly synthesized polyproteins at the appropriate places to create mature functional protein components of an infectious HIV virion22. Cystatins are thought to be non-selective and inactivate proteases reversibly and competitively by indirect blockage of catalytic centers and form very stable bimolecular complexes with proteases23. Our findings demonstrated that cys C was able to abrogate the action of HIV protease on its peptide substrate, suggesting that it might prevent the normal functioning of HIV protease which in turn would potentially prevent viral replication and transmission. Human seminal plasma is known to contain cys C in abundant amounts. Hence, biologically active cys C was purified from seminal plasma employing gel permeation chromatography followed by immunoaffinity chromatography techniques. Two bands of cys C were obtained on SDS-PAGE, both of which reacted with the specific antibodies to cys C, thus leading to the conclusion that the low molecular weight band might be a truncated form of cys C. Previously, Martellini et al10 have identified fragments of cys C besides the whole cys C in human seminal plasma.",
