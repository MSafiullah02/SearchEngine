            "text": "Here we briefly summarise the processes that influenced the diffusion of the \u2018lunatic asylum\u2019 as a model of psychiatric care in France during the 18th and 19th centuries. Prior to these developments, no specific medical or health care response was proposed for people with mental disorders. They were placed in institutions for the indigent and criminals. Hitherto \u2018insanity\u2019 had not been understood as a treatable illness, so the aim was to restrain people identified as \u2018mad\u2019 and prevent them from disturbing public order, not to try to cure them. Foucault (1961, chapter II) suggests that in France, and particularly in Paris, this approach was clearly illustrated in institutions called H\u00f4pitaux G\u00e9n\u00e9raux created in 1656 (Imbert, 1982) to implement this policy described by Foucault (1988 edition, p. 38\u201364) as \u2018the great confinement\u2019. The lamentable conditions of their confinement were already being identified in the 18th century (Colombier & Doublet, 1785).",

            "text": "At around the start of the 19th century, in France as in other countries, we begin to see the seeds of innovation: insanity began to be interpreted as an illness that could be cared for in specialised institutional settings. This therapeutic innovation was rooted in the emergence of the philanthropic and humanist ideals of the 18th century. These were associated with a shift away from demonological interpretations of madness and the growing pre-eminence of naturalistic explanations. The idea of the curability of mental illness and the legitimacy of the physician\u2019s role in the social management and treatment of madness also contributed to the emergence of this innovation (Foucault, 1961, Gauchet and Swain, 1980). These ideas were promulgated through the \u2018alienist\u2019 school of thought, calling for the separation of \u2018mad\u2019 people into specialised, therapeutic settings as recommended by Pinel (1801) in France, and Tuke (1813) and Browne (1837) in the United Kingdom. They were developing the concept of mental \u2018alienation\u2019 (mental illness viewed as a person\u2019s inability to integrate in society), arguing that a mental disorder inhibited the sufferer\u2019s feelings to such an extent that eventually, both the self and the external world seemed unreal.",

The lunatic asylum thus became the preferred therapeutic instrument of this moral treatment, secluding mentally ill people from the stresses of mainstream society and family life and incarcerating them in a secluded place, ideally situated in tranquil countryside where a strict moral framework was imposed. Foucault (1988 edition, 259) argues that \u2018\u2026the asylum becomes, in Pinel\u2019s hands, an instrument of moral uniformity and social denunciation\u2026\u2019. \u2018Place\u2019 has considerable significance in this model; physicians aimed to put the mentally sick in a new situation, removed from places, objects, people and circumstances that shaped their usual relationships and behaviour. At this period, well before the introduction of psychotropic drugs, \u2018moral treatment\u2019, acting on intellect and feelings, also marked a move away from physical treatment by traditional methods of blood-letting and purges applied to the patient\u2019s body (Goldstein, 1997).",

In a report on institutions for the \u2018insane\u2019 presented to the French Interior Minister in 1819, the alienist physican Esquirol wrote: \u2018These unfortunate people are treated worse than criminals and reduced to a worse condition than animals\u2019. It was at around this period that Esquirol introduced the term \u2018asylum\u2019 to distinguish psychiatric care institutions from both the \u2018H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019 carceral regime and \u2019H\u00f4tel-Dieu\u2019 hospitals for paupers, since these earlier types of institution were considered oppressive, arbitrary in their treatment of mentally ill people, and likely to exacerbate their condition (Lant\u00e9ri-Laura, 2001). Esquirol wrote: \u2018I would like us to give these facilities a specific name which does not bring to mind a painful image; I propose we name them asylums\u2019 authors' translation from (Esquirol, 1818, p. 26). The term \u2018lunatic asylum\u2019 was still used as late as 1937 when it was replaced by \u2018psychiatric hospital\u2019. By then, psychiatry had become an established practice within the medical profession and psychiatric institutions had entered into the clinical domain. The later phase of our study period thus arguably represents the shift to a different model of care associated with a new phase in the diffusion of changing ideas about psychiatric treatment that were expressed in the new facilities built most recently.",

This required that every French d\u00e9partement (representing the local administrative tier of national government in France) provide a \u2018facility dedicated to host and care for lunatics\u2019. Promulgated under the July Monarchy, the Lunacy Act continued to influence the provision of care for mental disorders, for over 150 years as it was only revised on June 27th 1990 with the \u2018Act relative to the rights and protection of people hospitalised because of mental disorders and to their hospitalisation conditions\u2019. The Lunacy Act of 1838 instituted the mandatory provision of mental health care in each administrative d\u00e9partement either by the creation of at least one asylum or by contracting with an authorized voluntary hospital to do so. This legislation could therefore be expected to have had a significant impact on the geographical diffusion of this type of institutional structure, albeit that the \u2018Lunatic Asylum\u2019 was not specified as the model on which these facilities were to be built. Individuals that were to be housed in these new facilities were nevertheless described as \u2018lunatics\u2019 rather than \u2018insane\u2019 or \u2018agitated\u2019 which suggests that the law makers were influenced by the \u2018alienation\u2019 paradigm proposed by Pinel.",

            "text": "While the 1838 Lunacy Act did not include direct guidelines on the type of site that should be preferred for asylum facilities, psychiatric ideas on the subject had already been clearly expressed in France. The Esquirol (1838) thus specified that asylums should be built outside cities for economic and therapeutic reasons. The following quote illustrates alienist ideas that dictated 19th Century views of what might constitute (or undermine) a therapeutic setting for care of mental illness: \u201cMost lunatic asylums are located in cities, a few in the countryside, in the plains or on the heights. In cities, space is lacking, the sick are excited by the hubbub and the noise of the population; visits are more numerous and more frequent; nurses are more distracted, more inclined to leave, while in countryside, there is more space, the sick enjoy more peace and quiet, can go out for a walk in tranquil surroundings or engage in gardening; they have fewer visitors and finally, there are economic advantages. Buildings on a high plateau are more favourably situated but when the plateau is not sufficiently extensive, buildings cannot develop on the same level or be sufficiently spaced out; terraces and steps are then required because of the uneven ground.\u201d He specifically cites the example of Antiquaille hospital in Lyon: \u201cLocated at mid-altitude on the Fourviere Mountain, it is built on the ruins of an ancient Roman construction. This choice of location was unfortunate. It was impossible to design suitable buildings: yards are too narrow, promenade galleries are missing, the ground is arid, and vegetation cannot improve the view or refresh the air. Water is not very abundant whereas it is required in such a house. Views are certainly very extensive, but the insane can constantly see their fellow citizens coming and going on the banks of the Saone River and in the neighbouring streets. They hear the hubbub of the city; is that not sufficient to provoke feelings of irritation likely to increase and to maintain delirium?\u201d (translated by the authors from\nEsquirol, (1838, p. 463)).\n",

These asylums constituted a new type of clinical and therapeutic environment for care of mental illness as conceived by Pinel. In the following discussion we use the term \u2018asylum\u2019 to refer to state sponsored, specialised psychiatric hospitals in France that were either established following the 1838 Lunacy Act, or pre-existing facilities, including voluntary or religious institutions, recognized by the government as meeting the requirements of the Act. Other institutions providing mental health care (in multi-specialty general hospitals or independent institutions not recognized by the state) are not included in this category, although their contribution in the general context of care provision is taken into consideration in our analysis. In this study, \u2018asylum\u2019 therefore refers to an administrative category of residential institution. These institutions did not all systematically incorporate every aspect of Pinel or Tuke\u2019s asylum model of care, and it is likely that the care provided over the period covered, varied from one institution to the next. However, one aspect of asylum design does become apparent in this analysis; the preference for a rural or semi-rural location as an ideal site. Our analysis indicates that this had a significant and lasting influence on the geographical development of psychiatric care in France and contributed to the specific geographical pattern of diffusion of asylum facilities around the country, as will be discussed below.",

The lunatic asylum can also be considered as an \u2018institutional innovation\u2019 according to the Pederson\u2019s (1970) definition, because it does not directly apply to individuals or households (as in \u2018individualistic\u2019 or \u2018domestic\u2019 innovation), but involves the introduction of a collective service.

Centrally managed innovation diffusion may follow different time space paths than individualistic or decentralised processes. In this case, the adopter of the innovation was central government, aiming to influence the process of innovation through local administrative and geographical levels of government throughout the country. The government of the day was keen to demonstrate the effectiveness of this recently created government structure, inspired by the egalitarian and republican goals of the French Revolution (1790). In 1838, legally assigned with new powers in terms of resources, broader responsibilities and greater facilities, French d\u00e9partements provided a conduit for central power to all parts of France, ensuring the management of national space in line with central government policy (Burgui\u00e8re & Revel, 1989). This was paralleled by increasing spatial accessibility of most parts of the country, particularly in the first part of the 19th century with the expansion of the railway network (suggesting interesting potential parallels with Bretagnolle\u2019s study mentioned in the introduction). These processes might have been expected to encourage homogenization and evenness in social and economic development across all French d\u00e9partements, though they might also have tended to encourage early adoption of the new model of psychiatric hospital in the geographical centres of central governmental control in Paris, the capital city, and in provincial centres of government.",

The following analysis explores how these processes influenced the diffusion of asylums in 19th and 20th century France. The state hierarchy was strongly centred in the capital city and its regional seats of government, and had the potential to control the pattern of spreading the innovation through the national space. This could lead one to expect an even, more or less simultaneous geographical diffusion of asylum facilities designed to ensure provision in each d\u00e9partement. In many other cases of innovation diffusion, the largest urban centres are most likely to be the sites for early adoption. However, in this case, the diffusion phase dominated by the \u2018alienist\u2019 model of care could be expected to result in the early establishment of asylums in rural or semi-rural settings close to major towns and more particularly, in the proximity of regional administrative centres.",

The analysis proceeded by first trying to establish whether the 1838 legislation provided a major impetus to the development of asylums throughout the country, which would be consistent with the idea of a centralised institutional innovation. Then, at different historical phases of development of asylums, the analysis investigated the parts of the country where they were set up and the types of geographical setting where they were concentrated. In order to model the neighbourhood diffusion process, a contiguity matrix of French d\u00e9partements was created and in each d\u00e9partement, Euclidian distance was calculated between asylum locations and the city where the Departmental administrative centre, (representing the local seat of government power), was located. Finally, to bring all this information together, a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was performed on the dataset to examine the connections between different aspects of the diffusion process. At this point we were also able to explore the possible significance of independent and religious institutions that were not recognized by the state as psychiatric \u2018asylums\u2019, but which may have influenced the spread of alienist ideas.",

Alternative methods also considered were multiple factorial analysis (MFA) (Escofier & Pag\u00e8s, 1998) or mixed data factor analysis (MDFA) (Pag\u00e8s, 2004). However, MCA was preferred since it is widely used and understood, as well as being the most likely to offer statistically robust results. To carry out this MCA, quantitative variables were converted into nominal categories, choosing a classification which would generate similar numbers of categories as were present in the qualitative variables. If the variables in MCA differ significantly in the number of categories, this will tend to distort their impact on the analysis. This is because variables with a large number of categories will carry disproportionate weight in the resulting dimensions.",

Although two hospitals with psychiatric wards and one private asylum existed during the 19th century, no state lunatic asylum was established in Paris during the first part of the period. It was not until 1867 that it opened its first lunatic asylum \u2018Sainte-Anne\u2019. Asylums for the curable and incurable would be built outside the city at a later date (Lamarche-Vadel & Pr\u00e9li, 1978). This may have been because of rigidities in the system of institutional provision that already existed in Paris, where the H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral had become firmly established. It would also be consistent with the preference for locating \u2018lunatic asylum\u2019 facilities in less urban settings. Although Pinel developed the \u2018lunatic asylum\u2019 concept through his observation and critique of conditions in the H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral setting, his ideas were initially concretised in new institutional facilities elsewhere in the country.",

Apart from the striking absence of the Parisian Capital at the emergent phase of the process, this gives the impression of a hierarchical diffusion process, with the innovation spreading initially in the more populated and economically advanced areas and later reaching the more sparsely populated and economically \u2018backward\u2019 regions (Saint Julien, 1985). This may have been a simple effect of the pressure of potential demand (which would be greatest in populated areas). However there may have been qualitative differences in the propensity for innovation and the availability of resources for new developments so that areas that were socially and economically more dynamic (Pumain, 2006) led the way in adopting the new style of asylum. This was a period of very rapid industrial and economic growth in the north associated with the exploitation of coal and the industrial revolution, so that the region saw rapid urbanization and population growth and was relatively wealthy at this time with sufficient community resources for new health care development.",

This may have been due to state intervention preceding legislation, and was probably also strongly influenced by the alienist network of reformists. During the years preceding the Act, the question of care for the \u2018insane\u2019 was on the government agenda. The French alienists Pinel and Esquirol, both Parisian doctors, were disseminating their ideas about treatment for the insane. The influence of Pinel\u2019s report entitled Medico-Psychological Treatise for Mental Alienation published in 1801 and reprinted in 1809, reached beyond the medical and bureaucratic fields (Goldstein, 1997). It is very likely that this original paradigm shift in psychiatry provoked by Pinel (and by his colleagues in other countries such as William Battie and William Tuke in England) initiated the lunatic asylum diffusion process rather than national government policy (see Philo, 2004, and Foucauld, 1988). With his theory on mental alienation and moral treatment, Pinel laid the foundations of French psychiatry through the diffusion of his ideas. On the eve of the 1838 Act, 38 d\u00e9partements out of 86 had already developed asylums to implement the innovations he proposed. Voluntary initiatives remained numerous during this phase. If there was a \u2018tipping point\u2019 at which innovation started to escalate, it occurred prior to 1838. The legislation appears to have simply taken up and officially endorsed a previously established movement by encouraging the diffusion of the innovation throughout the national space.",

This contagious diffusion model seems to be more relevant in the north of France.

The apparent acceleration in 1940 is the result of a bias in the data, noted above; some psychiatric hospitals established by 1940 could not be precisely attributed to the preceding years. Then we see a period of relative stabilisation until the 1960s when most of the \u2018late adopters\u2019 made some provision of this type. During the first part of the 20th century, the drive to expand provision seemed to focus particularly on rural and less populated d\u00e9partements. The North-East and South-West of France constitute areas with high levels of adoption during this period (see Fig. 2). Classic models of the diffusion of innovations would predict a slowing down in the third phase of a diffusion process, but Longin (1999) suggests a further explanation of this relative stabilisation at the beginning of the 20th century, linked with the development of secularism. The 1905 Act on separation of Church and State prevented any denominational private enterprise. Furthermore, damage during the First World War strongly affected some asylums. Closures and transformations were considered in some cases. This is a period of rehabilitation and repair rather than of new construction of asylums. The Second World War resulted in less destruction of hospitals but more than 40,000 patients died in French psychiatric hospitals during this period.",

Sectorisation interrupted the classical diffusion process proposed by Hagerstrand, so that the final phase of complete saturation predicted by his model did not occur. Instead, sectorisation introduces a new paradigm in psychiatric care, with a shift from large residential institutions to community-based services. In France, this process of deinstitutionalisation was initially planned on the basis of a territorial strategic framework. The \u2018psychiatric sector\u2019 was defined as a geo-demographic area of around 70,000 inhabitants, for which a specialised team and a range of community-based services were dedicated. At this point the incentive to provide psychiatric hospital facilities was no longer driven by the aim of providing institutions for long term care, but by the need to convert and redevelop the service infrastructure to provide acute inpatient services as part of a deinstitutionalised model of care. To be able to implement this new policy, d\u00e9partements who had not yet followed the trend to build asylums had to create such acute facilities. The last d\u00e9partements to build inpatient psychiatric services often set up psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric wards in the multi-specialty hospitals serving the area, resulting in a more rapid period of growth in the number of psychiatric facilities after the 1960s. Arguably, these were part of a new phase of innovation in psychiatric care, rather than the last stages of the diffusion of asylums. However, they can also be seen as a continuation of psychiatric service infrastructure development that had been set in motion though the asylum development process, since in the French case the original asylums have often been retained and converted to the community care model.",

This is consistent with the theory that dominant centres in the urban hierarchy adopt the innovation before smaller centres.

The fourth axis showed suburban locations were more common in rather sparsely populated d\u00e9partements while very rural locations were more often chosen in more populated d\u00e9partements.

The first of these was the question of how to analyse a hierarchical diffusion hypothesis when the urban hierarchy was changing significantly through the period studied. The dramatic modification of the French national urban hierarchy during the 19th century due to the unprecedented urban growth biases the hierarchical diffusion model. The d\u00e9partements\u2019 mean population density increased by a factor of 1.8 during the 19th century with a good deal of local variability, which radically altered their demographic ranking. The urban hierarchy also became more differentiated: in 1801, for the least and the most populated d\u00e9partements, the population density ratio was around one to seven; by 1982, the ratio was one to 34. This unstable urban hierarchy makes the hierarchical hypothesis difficult to apply, even if we hypothesise that the greatest population growth was associated with a greater probability of adopting the lunatic asylum innovation. Similar challenges also face other studies of diffusion over extended time periods. We also note that percentages in the tables and the results of the MCA need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small numbers of data points. This makes it especially difficult to assess the later stages of the diffusion of the asylum model. It would be interesting to have more information on the capacity of the institutions and the numbers of patients using them, in order to assess the extent to which provision was related to likely demand in d\u00e9partements of varying population size.",

            "text": "While the hierarchical diffusion model seems to be more relevant in our study, it nevertheless proves to be inadequate in explaining the whole process of diffusion and location of lunatic asylums. Some large urban centres, and namely the capital city, Paris, delayed in the construction of asylum facilities despite the fact that it had been the centre of emergence of the clinical and therapeutic ideas about the moral treatment and the need for such asylums. This delay in the creation of a lunatic asylum in Paris was criticized at the time and interpreted as an administrative failure. For example, Semelaigne wrote in 1860: \u2018In France, several large cities already have model establishments, and rival improvements are developing in foreign countries. In Paris, however, through a regrettable anomaly, the Bicetre and Salpetriere hospitals are not affected by this trend, as indicated by both their imperfections and gaps in their scientific progress and actual achievements. This immobility, in a centre from which fruitful initiatives usually emanate, cannot continue. The capital city is embarrassing itself. A special commission has been established to consider the changes required in this situation\u2019. (translated from a quote from Daum\u00e9zon (1959)). This phenomenon reflects both the social rejection of people with mental illness and the facilities to treat them, and processes operating in landscapes of power as defined by Dear and Wolch (1987). While Paris was a centre of psychiatric knowledge, it may have been slow to establish asylums because of the effort required to reorganize the existing provision in \u2018H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019 facilities, and there may also have been motives to distance people with mental illness from the capital by devolving provision for \u2018the insane\u2019 to the provincial d\u00e9partements.",

Other authors have interpreted the development of psychiatric medicine less in terms of repression and punitive action towards mentally ill people and more in terms of innovative knowledge of the social and psychological determinants of mental illness progressively leading to a long term shift towards new models of care and risk governance (Gauchet and Swain, 1980, Qu\u00e9tel, 2009, Swain, 1977).
