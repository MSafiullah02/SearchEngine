Thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) prompted many clinicians, including neurologists, to add heparin to the therapeutic arsenal used in the fight against the virus. However, this drug could resolve the epiphenomenon but not the disease.",

It is well known that molecular mimicry has a role in the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 [3]. In my opinion, it would be appropriate if this Journal would stimulate the scientific community on the fact that molecular mimicry phenomena can occur in SARS-CoV-2, as well as it was described in another SARS [4]. In fact, it could explain both the acute pulmonary embolism and the multi-organ microvascular thrombosis that some patients experience. Therefore, it is also urgent to start the search for human epitopes that turn into autoantigens, and to remind this risk to all those who are currently working on vaccines.",
