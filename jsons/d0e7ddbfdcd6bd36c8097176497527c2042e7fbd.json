The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15 th , 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6 th , 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru.",

Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government.",

In particular, the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has an ability to exert substantial severe disease and mortality burden especially affecting individuals older than 60 years and those with prior health conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes (Adler, 2020; Team, 2020) . As of April 15 th , 2020, the trajectory of the pandemic varies significantly around the world ranging from relatively well contained outbreaks in Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong to explosive epidemics characterized by initial exponential growth periods in a few hotspots located in various countries around the world including the United States, Italy, Spain, UK, France, and Iran (Ebbs, 2020; Griffiths, 2020; Minder, 2020) .",

In this equation the numerator represents the total new cases I \u0b67 , and the denominator represents the total number of cases that contribute to the new cases I \u0b67 at time t \u0b67 . The relative contribution of imported cases to the secondary disease transmission is represented by the parameter 0\u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. We perform a sensitivity analyses by setting \u03b1 = 0.15 and \u03b1 = 1.0 to assess the relative contribution of imported cases to the secondary disease transmission (Nishiura & Roberts, 2010) . This is followed by the derivation of the uncertainty bounds around the curve of R directly from the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates (r, p). We estimate R for 300 simulated curves assuming a Poisson error structure (Chowell, 2017) .
