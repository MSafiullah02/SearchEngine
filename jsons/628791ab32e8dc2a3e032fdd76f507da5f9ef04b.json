            "text": "In the past two decades, bats have emerged as an important model system to study host-pathogen interactions. More recently, it has been shown that bats may also serve as a new and excellent model to study aging, inflammation, and cancer, among other important biological processes. The cave nectar bat or lesser dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) is known to be a reservoir for several viruses and intracellular bacteria. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India to Southeast Asia and pollinates several plant species, including the culturally and economically important durian in the region. Here, we report the whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, followed by subsequent de novo assembly, of the E. spelaea genome solely using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing platform. Findings: The newly assembled E. spelaea genome is 1.97 Gb in length and consists of 4,470 sequences with a contig N50 of 8.0 Mb. Identified repeat elements covered 34.65% of the genome, and 20,640 unique protein-coding genes with 39,526 transcripts were annotated. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the PacBio long-read sequencing platform alone is sufficient to generate a comprehensive de novo assembled genome and transcriptome of an important bat species. These results will provide useful insights and act as a resource to expand our understanding of bat evolution, ecology, physiology, immunology, viral infection, and transmission dynamics.",

More recently, bats have been increasingly recognized as an important reservoir harboring numerous pathogenic viruses while displaying minimal clinical signs of disease [3] . Indeed, comparing the genomes of bats with the genomes of other mammalian species has revealed an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes. These include those involved in DNA damage repair and innate immune functions, which may partially explain bats' unique tolerance to deadly viruses and their unusually long life span [4] . Together, this highlights bats as an emerging model organism in the study of ecology, development, aging, and evolution.",

Most of these genomes were assembled using only short Illumina sequencing reads (49-150 bp) , with the exception of R. aegyptiacus, which utilized both short reads (data not released) from the Illumina HiSeq platform and long reads (data not released) from the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform, resulting in a hybrid genome assembly. The long-read length of PacBio sequencing, which is available for both DNA and RNA sequencing (also known as isoform sequencing [Iso-Seq]), has shown considerable promise in genomics studies. For example, PacBio DNA sequencing has improved assembly of the human [8] , gorilla [9] , loblolly pine [10] , and avian genomes [11] , while Iso-Seq has helped deepen our understanding of alternative splicing in the chicken [12] , coffee bean [13] , and maize [14] transcriptomes.",

It is widely distributed over both the tropics and subtropics, throughout the Indomalayan region [15] [16] [17] . This species has been associated with pollination of durian and other fruits of both cultural and economic importance throughout Asia [18] . Additionally, this species has been identified as a carrier of orthoreoviruses, Lyssa virus, filoviruses, flavivirus, coronaviruses, and astroviruses [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .

In order to compare the REs of E. spelaea with those of other genomes, we also performed the same analysis on all 14 available bat genomes on NCBI. Consistent with observations that PacBio technology is a better solution for solving repeats [8, 27] , we found that known REs accounted for 34.65% of the genome in Espe.v1, which is the highest proportion among all bat genomes published to date (0.71% higher than that of the second REabundant bat genome, R. sinicus; Table 2 , Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Similar to other bat genomes, the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeat elements constituted two of the highest proportion of all REs in Espe.v1, 51.32% and 18.05%, respectively (Supplementary Table S2 ). After repeat masking, the genome was annotated with Maker2 (v. 2.31.9) [30] by integrating homologous prediction, ab initio prediction, and Iso-Seq-based prediction methods (see Methods section). As a result, the predicted gene set included 20,640 protein-coding genes (Fig. 2) , of which 11,819 (57.2%) unique coding genes were supported by Iso-Seq and 16,637 (80.6%) were supported by homologous predictions. The relatively higher number of protein-coding genes predicted in E. spelaea compared to P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus is likely due to a more homologous approach being used to predict the gene models of E. spelaea than that of P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus (see Methods section). In summary, 18,588 (90.1%) of the coding genes were supported by at least one of the two types of prediction evidence (homologous and Iso-Seq evidence).",

The E. spelaea genome assembly exemplifies the power of long-read sequencing technologies in rapid de novo assembly of a nonmodel genome and alternative-splicing isoform identification. Compared to the hybrid assembled R. aegyptiacus genome, the \"PacBio-only\" assembly was faster, more straightforward, and possessed higher contiguous N50 contigs and better repeatresolving with a minimum difference (0.7%) in gene integrity. Thus, our study provides a high-quality reference genome for use in any future comparative studies. Even without scaffolding, these highly contiguous contigs and FL gene transcripts will be helpful to researchers to extract more accurate genomic loci information of their genes of interest, saving a great amount of energy, resources, and time. Our Iso-Seq results have increased our understanding of the complexity of the bat transcriptome and aided in alternative transcript identification. This complexity in the transcriptome of bats is still likely to be underestimated since Iso-Seq was performed at a relatively shallow depth (\u223c20x coverage) in this study. We would like to further highlight that this complexity is attributed by the type and number of alternative transcription events, as well as previously unannotated transcripts in bats. As more and more transcriptome data become available for E. spelaea, e.g., Illumina transcriptome sequencing of various tissues, this will aid in the identification of other alternative transcripts and continuously improve the annotation of the genome and the accuracy of protein coding sequences, as has been evident with the P. alecto genome since its first release. Taken together, we have provided a valuable resource, an E. spelaea genome and transcriptome database, for future comparative and functional studies, as well as demonstrated the advantages of employing the latest long-read sequencing technology in such studies of exotic species.",

The Maker2 pipeline was first run on the masked genome using the Iso-Seq transcriptome to infer gene predictions (est2genome = 1), and training files for the ab initio gene predictors Augustus and SNAP were generated based on these results. Then, the annotation pipeline was run iteratively two additional times using the Iso-Seq transcriptome as evidence (est2genome = 0) and providing new training files with each run. At this point, the protein-homology evidence was set to include all unique proteins in the eight different mammals. Next, Maker predict transcripts were merged with Iso-Seq transcripts and collapsed using pbtranscript-ToFU to include all the unique alternative spliced transcripts. Finally, low-quality genes shorter than 50 amino acids and/or exhibiting premature termination were removed to produce the final gene set.",

Briefly, Proteinortho software (v. 5.16b) [31] was used to identify the single-copy orthologous genes under default parameter setting. Using M. domestica as an outgroup, we identified 3,185 single-copy orthologous genes from E. spelaea and 11 other mammalian genomes (as described above). The coding sequence from each single-copy family was aligned by MUSCLE (v. 3.8.31) [44] . Four-fold degenerate sites were extracted from each gene alignment by an inhouse Python script and concatenated to one super gene for each species. Then, RAxML (v. 8.2.11) [45] was applied to build phylogenetic trees for the concatenated sequences as described [4] . A total of 1,000 bootstrap replicates were employed to assess branch reliability in RAxML. Last, PAML (v. 4.9c) mcmctree [46] was used to determine split times based on the topology obtained in the RAxML analysis [4] . The gamma prior for the overall substitution rate was described by shape and scale parameters that were set as 1 and 11.1, respectively, calculated according to the substitution rate per time unit using PAML baseml [47] . Fossil calibrations were retrieved from the TimeTree database (last accessed 12/15/2017) [48] . Other parameters were set as default. The PAML mcmctree pipeline was run two independent times to confirm convergence and all acceptance proportions fall in the interval (20%, 40%).",
