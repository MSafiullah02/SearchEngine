The variable flying fox, Pteropus hypomelanus, is a megachiropteran bat that inhabits Sulawesi and small islands from the Bay of Bengal and the Malay Peninsula to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The range of this species is fragmented, and rapid habitat destruction is occurring throughout the range. Since 1989, it has been listed as CITES appendix II. There are seven subspecies of this bat, the most endangered being P. hypomelanus\nmaris, found on the Maldives [2]. The greatest threat to the variable flying fox is human predation and habitat destruction. This bat is heavily hunted and is exported for food in the Philippines. Residents of Guam have imported large numbers of Pteropus spp. from other Pacific islands as a delicacy. Thirty-four percent of megachiropteran bats are at risk of extinction [3], and all members of the genus Pteropus are listed as at least CITES appendix II.",

            "text": "It is not surprising to find significant pathogen diversity in bats. There are over 900 bat species, representing approximately 20% of mammalian diversity [4]. While less than 2% of human pathogens have bats as natural reservoirs, several emerging potentially lethal viral infections of humans have recently been found in wild flying fox populations, attracting significant interest [4]. These include Nipah virus, Menangle virus, Hendra virus, and Australian bat lyssavirus. Evidence suggests that megachiropteran bats are carriers of Ebola virus [5], and Rhinolophid bats, which are closely related to the megachiropterans, are carriers of SARS-like coronaviruses [1], [6], [7]. With the subsequent interest in viruses of bats, Tioman virus has recently been discovered [8], and it is likely that further bat viruses will be discovered in the near future. Evidence for Nipah virus [9], Tioman virus, and Australian bat lyssavirus [10] have been found in wild P. hypomelanus. Currently, serum neutralization assays are the most common tests used to detect the presence of antibodies to specific pathogens in bats, and are accepted as the reference standard [11]. However, serum neutralization assays require days to weeks for results, and require virus culture, which is labor intensive, slow, and involves live virus culture, representing a risk to personnel. IgG assays have also been performed in bats using chimeric protein G, a streptococcal protein, and protein A, a staphylococcal protein, that bind IgG from a number of different species [11], [12], [13]. Assays have also been performed using only protein G [7], [14]. Protein A and protein G do not bind well to immunoglobulins from all species [15]. Protein A has been found not to bind well to immunoglobulins from some bat species [16]. The specificity and avidity of either protein G or chimeric protein G/protein A for bat immunogobulins has not been published.",

Wells of a high protein binding microplate (Nunc Maxisorp, Fisher Scientific) were coated with 50 \u03bcl of DNP-BSA (1.0 \u03bcg/ml) and were left to adsorb overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After this and each subsequent step, all wells were washed three times with PBS-AZ and 0.05% Tween-20 using an automated microplate washer. After washing, all wells were blocked with PBS-AZ containing 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM). This and each subsequent step of the ELISA were incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at approximately 25 \u00b0C. Variable flying fox plasma samples were diluted from 1:25 to 1:32,000, and replicate wells were done for each dilution. PBS-AZ was applied to a pair of wells for each plasma sample to serve as duplicate negative control wells. Fifty microliter of preimmune and immune bat plasma dilutions were used to coat the wells. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated protein G (1:500 in PBS-AZ), rabbit anti-P. hypomelanus IgG polyclonal antibody (1:10,000 in PBS-AZ), and mouse anti-P. hypomelanus IgG monoclonal antibody (undiluted hybridoma supernatant) were added for the detection of bound bat antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma A-8025, 1:2000 in PBS-AZ) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG (A-1902, 1:1000 in PBS-AZ) were used as secondary antibodies for polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, respectively. After washing, 0.1 ml of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added for detection. Color development was monitored visually, and the OD405 was recorded after 30 and 60 min by use of a microplate reader. For analysis, the average OD405 of the negative controls were subtracted from the average OD405 readings of all other wells of the corresponding antibody (corrected OD405).",

A Tris\u2013glycine buffer (Invitrogen) in 20% methanol was used as the transfer buffer. The blotting time was 60 min at 30 V. After transfer, the nitrocellulose was immediately blocked overnight with PBS-AZ containing 5% NFDM at room temperature (approximately 25 \u00b0C). The nitrocellulose blot was washed three times for 5 min each with PBS solution containing 0.02% sodium azide and 0.05% Tween-20 and placed into a channel divider (Fast Blot Developer, Pierce, Rockford, IL).

In a study on rabies vaccination in vampire bats, 31 of 32 bats were protected from challenge by vaccination, whereas 9 of 10 unvaccinated bats succumbed [29]. Of these 31 protected bats, 9 (29%) did not develop a neutralizing antibody titer, implying a large role for cellular immunity in protection. Absence of antibody does not demonstrate that an animal has not been exposed to a pathogen.",

Based on their western blot results, their polyclonal antibodies appear to have a greater specificity for chiropteran IgG than the more broadly cross-reactive polyclonal antibodies developed in this study. Their antibodies were used to determine phylogeny by examining cross-reactivity with other species. This may be a future use for the antibodies developed in this study. Evidence is mounting that the phylogenetic division between the suborders Microchiroptera and Megachiroptera is a false dichotomy, and that microchiropterans are not monophyletic. Molecular sequence data suggests that Rhinolophoid bats actually cluster with Pteropodid bats, which were considered the sole family in the megachiroptera [1]. These bats have been classified into the Yinpterochiroptera, and the remaining microchiropterans classified into the Yangochiroptera. No Rhinolophoid bat sera were examined, so no conclusions can be drawn regarding cross-reactivity, but this may be a direction for further studies.",

The polyclonal antibody was found to cross-react well against IgG of all bat species tested, but did not show as great a difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated bats. This was likely due to non-specific binding as seen on the western blot, resulting in high backgrounds. The monoclonal antibody was found to cross-react well against IgG of six other species in the genus Pteropus and to cross-react less strongly against IgG from E. helvum or P. hastatus. Protein G distinguished best between vaccinated and unvaccinated bats, and these results validate the use of protein G for detection of bat IgG antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies developed in this study recognized immunoglobulins from other members of the genus Pteropus well, and may be useful in applications where specific detection of Pteropus IgG is needed. Further investigation of these reagents in diagnostic assays is merited.",
