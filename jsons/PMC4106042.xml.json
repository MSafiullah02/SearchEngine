While effective vaccines and antiviral drugs have been developed for circulating strains of human influenza (Santone et al., 2008), continued antigenic drift and shift generate novel virus strains that pose a threat to immunologically na\u00efve populations. The emergence of pandemic influenza H1N1pdm in the spring of 2009 led to hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations with significant numbers of fatalities in North America (Update: Influenza Activity \u2013 United States, 2009\u201310). Severe cases were characterized by viral pneumonia and uncontrollable pulmonary inflammation, and were similar to the inflammation observed in severe cases of SARS, H5N1 and Spanish Influenza patients (Baillie and Digard, 2013, Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010, Cameron et al., 2012, Curfs et al., 2008) Importantly there is little understood regarding the pathways driving the pulmonary inflammatory process for these diseases.",

Early host responses are characterized by the mobilization of leukocytes, such as alveolar and circulating macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) (World Health Organization, 2012) and NK cells which continues into the activation of adaptive immune cells such as T-cells, B-cells and dendritic cells. Importantly, factors that lead to the activation of these cells and cell networks are increased after H1N1pdm Infection (Influenza Activity \u2013 United States and Worldwide,, Ohtsuki et al., 2006, Ohtsuki et al., 2006, Paquette et al., 2014). These include inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines and lipid mediators like eicosanoids.",

To date, 11 secreted PLA2 enzymes (sPLA2; IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA and XIIB) (Murakami et al., 1999), six cytosolic PLA2 enzymes (cPLA2s; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03be) (Kim et al., 2007), nine Ca2+-independent PLA2 enzymes (iPLA2s; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b42, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b52 \u03be, \u03b8, and \u03b7) (Murakami et al., 1999), and two lysosomal PLA2 enzymes (Femling et al., 2005) have been described. The sPLA2 enzymes are structurally related, Ca2+-dependent proteins with unique biological properties, enzymatic activities against membrane phospholipids and tissue and cellular locations, suggest distinct roles for these enzymes in various pathophysiological events. sPLA2 enzymes are implicated in lipid mediator release, degranulation, cellular proliferation, destruction of invading bacteria (Murakami et al., 1999), viruses (Kennedy et al., 1995, Mazur et al., 2007) and activation of intracellular signaling cascades (Kim et al., 2007). GX-sPLA2 is expressed in alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells in the lungs of patients with pneumonia (Marshall et al., 2000), neuronal cells (Gaudreault and Gosselin, 2008), male reproductive organs (Dennis, 1994) and atherosclerotic plaques (Huang et al., 2011), and is cleaved to its active form in inflamed tissues (Lu et al., 2006).",

Eicosanoids also regulate antigen presenting cell [APC] function (Degousee et al., 2001, Murakami et al., 2011, Truchetet et al., 2012), T cell maturation (Myers et al., 2012) and Th17 expansion (Stephenson et al., 1988, Zhao et al., 2011).

Therefore, sPLA2 enzymes and eicosanoids may play a central role in determining the outcome of pulmonary viral infection.

Recently, GX-sPLA2 has been suggested as a signal amplifier in TLR4 stimulation which further suggests a role for GX-sPLA2 in the regulation of the inflammatory response (Schultz-Cherry and Jones, 2010). Considering the potential of GX-sPLA2 in the inflammatory response, sPLA2 enzymes may play a central role in determining the outcome of pulmonary viral infections, which cause uncontrolled inflammatory destruction of the respiratory tract (Henderson et al., 1995).",

We have shown that H1N1pdm infection in this mouse model leads to pulmonary inflammation, a histopathological picture similar to what is observed in fatal human cases, and over 90% lethality within 5\u20138 days (Paquette et al., 2012). In this study, we document a marked increase in GX-sPLA2 expression in lung following infection in GX+/+ mice. To specifically evaluate the pathophysiological role of GX-sPLA2 in our lethal influenza mouse model, we subjected GX+/+ and GX\u2212/\u2212 mice (Henderson et al., 1995) to H1N1pdm infection in vivo. Our results showed that, in two distinct mouse strains, targeted deletion of GX significantly increased survival following H1N1pdm infection in comparison with GX+/+ mice. In addition, eicosanoid accumulation in BAL fluid was attenuated and induction of T cell and B cell associated genes was higher in GX\u2212/\u2212 than GX+/+ mice after H1N1pdm infection. Taken together, our data suggests a negative role for GX-sPLA2 in the immune response to pulmonary infection with H1N1pdm influenza in vivo. Furthermore, these findings implicate GX-sPLA2 as a potential therapeutic target during severe influenza infection.",

Real-time PCR was performed on the extracted RNA and identified a significant increase in the ratio of GX-sPLA2 to GAPDH mRNA on day 3 and day 14, but not day 6 pi (Fig. 1Ai). GX-sPLA2/GAPDH mRNA increased approximately four fold on day 3 and three fold on day 14 compared to baseline. Furthermore, we also determined the regulation of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (Fig. 1Aii) and the sPLA2 family member GV-PLA2 (Fig. 1Aiii) in both GX+/+ and GX\u2212/\u2212 mice. There was negligible total protein upregulation of cPLA2 and GV-PLA2 was not regulated throughout the infection time course. The absence of the change of total protein of cPLA2 was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). No statistical differences in mRNA transcripts for cPLA2 and GV-PLA2 were noted between the GX+/+ or GX\u2212/\u2212 mice. These results demonstrated that H1N1pdm influenza infection stimulated a bimodal increase in pulmonary GX-sPLA2 mRNA expression which was specific for this sPLA2 since neither cPLA2 nor GV-sPLA2 was up-regulated.",

Lungs from GX+/+ and GX\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with H1N1pdm were harvested at baseline, 3, 6 and 14 days pi and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis with anti-mouse GX-sPLA2 antiserum. Visualization by light microscopy revealed GX-sPLA2 protein accumulation in the lungs of infected mice compared to baseline (Fig. 1B). GX-sPLA2 protein was identified in inflammatory cells that had infiltrated in the alveolar space on day 3 and 6 in GX+/+ mice infected with H1N1pdm (shown by arrows). GX-sPLA2 protein was also clearly identified in epithelial cells lining the bronchioles on day 3, 6 and 14 in GX+/+ mice infected with H1N1pdm (Fig. 1B, upper right panels). No staining for GX-sPLA2 protein was observed in GX\u2212/\u2212 mice at baseline or at any time point after infection with H1N1pdm (Fig. 1B, lower panel rows). Similarly, no proteins cross reacting with the secondary antibody alone was identified in GX+/+ or GX\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1B, left hand panels). We confirmed the loss of GX-sPLA2 in the GX\u2212/\u2212 mice by immunoblot analysis. We indeed observed a specific depletion of GX-sPLA2 but no change in the expression of GIIA-sPLA2 in the GX\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to GX+/+ mice (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results show that intranasal infection with H1N1pdm increases GX-sPLA2 RNA and protein expression in the lung that corresponds to the increase in lung inflammation associated with influenza infection. This suggests a possible role for GX-sPLA2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary H1N1pdm influenza infection.",

Together, these studies showed that targeted deletion of GX-sPLA2 in two different mouse models led to increased survival following H1N1pdm infection in vivo.

Hemorrhage, edema, and necrotizing respiratory epithelia were also observed with similar severity among both groups. Pathology persisted until day 7 pi where mononuclear cell and neutrophil infiltration were still profound and caused patches of consolidation in the lung tissue in both groups. It seemed by day 14 pi that the pulmonary pathology was slightly more minimal in the GX\u2212/\u2212 mice with reduced level of leukocyte infiltration. In contrast, multi foci cell infiltration and tissue consolidation was still prominent in the GX+/+ lungs by day 14 pi.",

As previously reported by our group (Kudo and Murakami, 1999, Paquette et al., 2014, Rowe et al., 2010), influenza infection caused a progressive increase in the total number of upregulated genes in the lung tissue of GX+/+ mice (1246 genes at 3 days pi and 2469 genes at 6 days pi). Genes that belonged to different functional groups, such as immune response, inflammatory response and prostaglandin signaling pathways (\nFig. 6, Fig. 7) showed a progressive increase that was parallel to the global evolution of gene expression.

Here we evaluated the pathophysiological role of GX-sPLA2 during severe influenza A H1N1pdm infection in the mouse. We found that GX-sPLA2 expression was increased following infection, and that targeted deletion of GX-sPLA2 led to increased survival in mice. Lack of GX-sPLA2 resulted in decreased levels of PGD2, LTB4, cysteinyl leukotrienes, PGE2 and Lipoxin A4 and increased adaptive immune responses at 3 but not 6 days following H1N1pdm infection. This demonstrates that GX-sPLA2 plays an important role in the production of several biologically active inflammatory lipid mediators during the early phase of the inflammatory response that follows H1N1pdm influenza infection. Human patients with a severe respiratory disease caused by influenza infection have a dysregulated inflammatory response that leads to lung pathogenesis associated with hypercytokinemia in most cases (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010, Curfs et al., 2008). Taken together with the previous findings showing a role of GX-sPLA2 in inflammatory lung diseases, our work supports the further investigation of the therapeutic potential of attenuating GX-sPLA2 during severe influenza infection as well as the interplay between eicosanoids and adaptive immunity.",

We show that GX-sPLA2 protein and mRNA expression increased in the lungs of GX+/+ mice following H1N1pdm infection, suggesting that GX-sPLA2 may be used as a possible biomarker of severe influenza infection. This is the first report of increased GX-sPLA2 expression following influenza virus infection. Both epithelial cells and leukocytes were found to be sources of GX-sPLA2 during infection, and GX-sPLA2 expression was detected in epithelial cells 3 days prior to the infiltration of leukocytes. In will be interesting to determine in future experiments whether the specific deletion of GX-sPLA2 expression in epithelial cells vs. infiltrating leukocytes or both is responsible for the increased survival. Here we observed a bimodal expression pattern of GX-sPLA2 during the 14 day time course of infection. It is possible that this occurred due to the protein stability as it is used to regulate bioactive lipid mediator synthesis. If the protein does not remain stable throughout the course of infection and recovery, it may be important to have a second increase in GX-sPLA2 in the later stages of infection to compensate for the loss of protein. It is in fact possible that the protein exerts distinct roles in the clearance of the virus and tissue remodeling in addition to the regulation of immune cells. Such a scenario would require inductions at specific time points during infection. It will be important to further explore the local expression in the virus niche and the stability of protein GX-sPLA2 during influenza infection to better understand how GX-sPLA2 stability may influence influenza severity in the initiation of the innate immune response, adaptive maintenance, and recovery. Furthermore, it would also be of value to investigate the source of GX-sPLA2 by expression analysis of each cell type and also by investigating the role of hematopoietic GX-sPLA2 compared to epithelial GX-sPLA2. The latter could be studied by employing bone marrow transplantation experiments from GX\u2212/\u2212 mice into GX+/+ and the reverse. While the association between GX-sPLA2 and influenza related complications has not previously been investigated, LTB4, a downstream product of GX-sPLA2 has been suggested to be a biomarker for pulmonary disease and respiratory complications following trauma (Influenza Activity \u2013 United States and Worldwide,, Henderson et al., 2011, Shridas et al., 2011).",

Deletion of GX-sPLA2 in a Th2 cytokine-driven mouse asthma model significantly impairs development of asthma (Henderson et al., 1995) and accordingly, administration of a human GX-sPLA2 selective inhibitor in a human GX-sPLA2 knock-in mouse model led to a significant reduction in airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperresponsiveness (Henderson et al., 2007). Furthermore, although not specific for human GX-sPLA2, the indole-based sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib has been shown to significantly inhibit sPLA2 activity in the BAL fluid of infants with post-neonatal ARDS (de Jong et al., 2006) during induced asthma, suggesting the involvement of sPLA2 among other sPLA2s. Our results showing increased survival of the GX\u2212/\u2212 mice after infection with H1N1pdm further support the notion that GX-sPLA2 is a therapeutic target in pulmonary diseases due to viral infection and that infection with H1N1 might be better controlled by inhibiting this sPLA2.",

            "text": "One of the main functions of GX-sPLA2 is likely the generation of bioactive lipid mediators which play important roles in lung inflammatory diseases (Gao et al., 2013, Gaudreault and Gosselin, 2007, Van Elssen et al., 2011). Although we did not see any major differences in the mRNA analysis of the eicosanoid pathways between the GX\u2212/\u2212 and GX+/+ mice, measuring the mRNA levels of these genes may have limited value to determine the level of activation of their signaling pathways. Conversely, we observed decreased levels of PGD2, LTB4, cysteinyl leukotrienes, PGE2 and Lipoxin A4 in BAL fluid 3 day pi in the GX\u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that GX-sPLA2 acts upstream of these bioactive lipid mediators during influenza infection and thereby suggests a possible role of these bioactive mediators in pulmonary pathogenesis after influenza infection. In agreement with our findings, PGD2 has been implicated during influenza A infection as PGD2 expression in the lungs of older animals inhibits regulatory dendritic cells activity and T cell responses (Zhang et al., 2000). Other eicosanoids have been implicated in different lung diseases, and the dysregulation of leukotrienes and lipoxins have been reported as contributing factors to the pathogenesis and severity of other respiratory diseases (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2009). LTB4 has been suggested to play a destructive inflammatory role in the lung by priming neutrophils for adhesion, chemotaxis and stimulation of granule release (Cameron et al., 2007). As well PGD2, PGD receptor, lipocalin-type PGD synthase and LTB4 have been implicated in asthma pathogenesis (Arima and Fukuda, 2011, Masuda et al., 2005, Rusinova et al., 2012). Although asthma and pulmonary disease due to influenza infection differ in derivation, both are characterized by hyper-inflammation of the respiratory tract. Taken together, our data supports a role of GX-sPLA2 signaling and bioactive mediator production in the regulation of the pulmonary response to H1N1pdm infection. In the future it would be important to specifically determine whether PGD2, LTB4, cysteinly leukotrienes, PGE2, Lipoxin A4 or another AA metabolite specifically modulates the response to H1N1pdm infection.",

            "text": "The inflammatory response may be simultaneously beneficial and destructive during lung infection (Baillie and Digard, 2013, Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010). Although destructive killing of foreign pathogens is imperative for eradication and microbe clearing, the over production of inflammatory mediators leading to an overt inflammatory response may accentuate disease pathology, as is the case during severe influenza H5N1 and H1N1 infection (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2010, Curfs et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2009). This illustrates the dual role of proinflammatory mediators, which has also been suggested for some GX-sPLA2 downstream lipid mediators. For instance, LTB4 has been shown to increase the activity of nasal neutrophil killing of human coronavirus, RSV, and influenza B virus (Van Elssen et al., 2011) and to induce the release of antimicrobial peptides in vivo in the lungs of mice infected with viruses (Gao et al., 2013, Gaudreault and Gosselin, 2007). The lipid product protectin D1 has been implicated in influenza therapeutics (Arima and Fukuda, 2011, Mitsuishi et al., 2006). Although these previous reports seem to suggest a conflicting role for GX-sPLA2 in consideration of our data, it may be possible that LTB4 and GX-sPLA2 promote antiviral activity and are significant during a viral response but only at moderate levels. Alternatively, it is possible that GX-sPLA2 prevents H1N1 infection but also triggers excessive inflammation that is associated with lipid surfactant destruction. More work is needed to understand how the function of GX-sPLA2 mediates both beneficial and deleterious roles during influenza infection.",

The microarray mRNA data from lungs of GX+/+ infected mice were in agreement with our previously published data on pandemic H1N1 2009 virus infection, in mice including the progressive increase of immune and inflammatory responses and of the prostaglandin signaling pathway (Paquette et al., 2014). Together, the results of microarray analysis, gene expression by Real-Time RT PCR and immunocytochemistry of the lungs suggested that GX\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a more robust adaptive immune response than GX+/+ mice. Indeed, we observed significant differences in lymphocyte gene profiles at day 3 pi, associated with differences in the levels of lymphotoxin alpha and beta, B cell chemokines, T cell chemokine receptors and B cell immunoglobulin chains as measured which by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Expression of B cell immunoglobulin chain genes were substantially increased on day 3 pi in the GX\u2212/\u2212 mice but not in the GX+/+. B cell immunoglobulin gene expression was significantly greater on day 6 pi. and the expression of the T cell, B cell and dendritic cell chemokines and chemokine receptors, i.e., CCL19, CXCR3, etc., were significantly higher in the GX\u2212/\u2212 samples than GX+/+. These results suggest that the downstream products of GX-sPLA2, such as PGD2, PGE2, LTB4 may inhibit the early adaptive immune responses of T and B cells during viral infection and this fits with the fact that aspirin, which attenuates eicosanoid production, can be an effective therapy for patients with influenza infection (Matsuoka et al., 2000). It would be of value in future studies to further investigate the effect of GX-sPLA2 on the proliferation, activation and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes. Consistent with this notion, the chemokines and chemokine receptors found to be upregulated in the H1N1pdm infected GX\u2212/\u2212 mice are known to play significant roles in T and B cell migration and localization to the lymph nodes (Goracci et al., 2010, Muthuswamy et al., 2010). CXCL13/CXCR5 signaling has been shown to activate B cells (Sadik and Luster, 2012), which may explain the increased immunoglobulin chain gene expression observed in GX\u2212/\u2212 mice. Our data supports previous findings implicating PGD2 in the inhibition of cell migration to lymph nodes (Zhang et al., 2000), and PGE2 in the inhibition of adaptive immune cellular events such as chemokine production by DCs and the attraction of na\u00efve T cells (Murakami et al., 2011, Truchetet et al., 2012).",

Overall, the sPLA2 appears as a negative effector but it may act at several steps during infection. We found that GX-sPLA2 and its downstream products may have a role in the inhibition of adaptive immunity during viral infection in mice thereby contributing to pathogenesis. Within this mechanism, it is in fact possible that T and B cell maturation and activation are initiated in mice lacking GX-sPLA2 prior to virus infection, and that a more robust and earlier adaptive immune response increased the survival of GX\u2212/\u2212 mice after H1N1pdm infection. Since GX-sPLA2 may contribute to inflammatory response dysregulation during influenza infection and contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with hospitalized influenza patients, this work may shed important insight into the molecular mechanisms of severe influenza infection. Our findings further support the notion that GX-sPLA2 is an interesting therapeutic target in lung inflammatory diseases. Whether inhibition or attenuation of GX-sPLA2 activity during severe influenza infection has a therapeutic effect remains to be demonstrated.",

This mixed background strain has a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding GIIA-sPLA2 (Karabina et al., 2006), which has been implicated in bacterial phospholipid hydrolysis (Fang et al., 2011). Furthermore, we generated GX\u2212/\u2212 mice on the C3H/HeN background (\nFig. 1C) by backcrossing the C57BL/6J GX\u2212/\u2212 mice for 10 generations which had functional GIIA-sPLA2.",
