There is a strong association between antimicrobial resistance and modern livestock rearing, with the overuse of antimicrobials in livestock an important factor in the development of resistance in some pathogens that infect humans, or in the emergence of new resistant organisms. 9 Expansion of urban environments has led to increased interaction between wildlife and livestock, and climate change is an important enabling factor for transmission of many infections; for example, affecting mosquito populations competent for arboviruses.",

This arrangement is recommended by WHO 14 Commentary countries aiming to prevent and respond to the international spread of disease. 19(a2) They require States to assess, strengthen and maintain core capacities for surveillance, risk assessment, reporting and response, and notify WHO of all events that may represent a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, including unnamed diseases or events, aiming for an all-hazards approach. 19 Antimicrobial resistance is not specifically listed in the IHR, but is included in the guide to implementation as a risk to be targeted by national initiatives. 20 Although the IHR have been widely criticised, it was a lack of implementation rather than the agreement itself that was responsible for failures in this response, according to the Review Committee on the role of the IHR (2005) in the Ebola outbreak and response. 21 Unfortunately there has been only a partial international response to the IHR, with just 35% of State Parties (including New Zealand) having core capacities in place by the end of 2015. 21, 22 Full implementation will require support for lowincome countries to strengthen their health systems. 21 The Review Committee has developed a draft implementation plan for their recommendations. This aims to: accelerate countries' implementation of IHR, with particular focus on countries with high vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases and low capacity; strengthen WHO's capacity to implement IHR and respond to emergencies; and improve monitoring of IHR core capacities by introducing a joint external evaluation tool. 23 One facet of this implementation plan is the development of a five-year global strategic plan by WHO and will emphasise the importance of making use of existing frameworks, including the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED). 23 Other frameworks have been developed to assist countries to implement the IHR, notably the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA each with five-year targets, actions and indicators. These action packages are intended to facilitate specific commitments and leadership from countries involved. An assessment tool for essential national structures and functions has also been developed and piloted. 25 The recently developed IHR (2005) core capacities joint external evaluation tool is structured similarly, with 19 areas grouped under the headings 'prevent' , 'detect' , 'respond' and other IHR-related hazards and points of entry. 23 It is recommended that countries undertake one external evaluation every four years. 23 APSED is a strategic framework for countries of the Western Pacific and South East Asian regions to strengthen their capacity to manage and respond to emerging infectious disease threats, and comply with IHR (2005). 27 It recommends collaboration mechanisms between human and animal health sectors, and that national pandemic preparedness and response plans should be integrated into a public health emergency plan for all emerging infectious diseases. 28 Its third version is currently in draft and now has eight focus areas: public health emergency preparedness; surveillance risk assessment and response; laboratories; zoonoses; prevention through health care (including antimicrobial resistance); risk communication; regional preparedness alert and response; and monitoring and evaluation. 9 At a recent (February 2017) meeting hosted by the Health Environment and Infection Research Unit of the University of Otago and the Integrated Systems for Epidemic Response, public health professionals saw APSED as the appropriate mechanism with which to develop IHR core capacities across the South Pacific.",

They give stakeholders the opportunity to deepen their understanding of crisis issues, clarify policies and processes, and build up trust and familiarity that can lead to faster decision making during a crisis. 35, 36 New Zealand public health professionals also emphasise the importance of exercises in building capacity, 37 and simulation exercises will form part of the new IHR core capacity monitoring and evaluation framework. 23 A New Zealand-based workshop and series of interviews with public health professionals (undertaken by one of us in 2015), 37 assessed utility of ranking pandemic 'scenarios' to inform planning. These were thought to be a useful way to consider threats for training and testing capacity. Other key components of emerging infectious disease preparedness identified during these discussions were retention of institutional knowledge, exercising responses, national public health leadership and consideration of potential impact on vulnerable populations. Surveillance outside notifiable diseases and laboratory capacity for highly pathogenic organisms were identified as major gaps in current New Zealand preparedness.",

Participants discussed the need for technical and financial support from Australia and NZ for Pacific Island countries in epidemiology, laboratory capacity and infection prevention and control, and recommended that countries in the region are encouraged to assess their capacity for responding to public health emergencies using appropriate tools such as the joint external evaluation tool. The need for field epidemiology training in public health workforce development was emphasised, and steps towards ensuring public health data is rapidly available and better utilised were discussed, including undertaking a stocktake of returned traveller surveillance and use of rapid electronic journals (e.g. Eurosurveillance). It was recommended that a health or development agency perform a regional surveillance needs assessment to guide development of an operational plan under APSED, and that agencies in the region continue to strengthen collaboration between human and animal health sectors at all levels with a view to developing an effective One Health platform.",
