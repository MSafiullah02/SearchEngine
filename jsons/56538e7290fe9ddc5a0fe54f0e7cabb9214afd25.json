Long-recognized agents that remain in research facilities in the 21 st century include parvoviruses of rats and mice, mouse rotavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and pinworms. The reasons for their persistence vary with the agent. The resilience of parvoviruses, for example, is due to their resistance to inactivation, their prolonged shedding, and difficulties with detection, especially in C57BL/6 mice. Rotavirus also has marked environmental resistance, but periodic reintroduction into facilities, possibly on bags of feed, bedding, or other supplies or equipment, also seems likely. TMEV is characterized by resistance to inactivation, periodic reintroduction, and relatively long shedding periods. Although MHV remains active in the environment at most a few days, currently prevalent strains are shed in massive quantities and likely transmitted by fomites. Pinworm infestations continue because of prolonged infections, inefficient diagnosis, and the survivability of eggs of some species in the environment. For all of these agents, increases in both interinstitutional shipping and the use of immunodeficient or genetically modified rodents of unknown immune status may contribute to the problem, as might incursions by wild or feral rodents. Elimination of these old enemies will require improved detection, strict adherence to protocols designed to limit the spread of infections, and comprehensive eradication programs.",

Published reports of the number or percentage of research institutions that conduct health surveillance are not available, nor are there reports indicating whether institutions include more of their intramural facilities in surveillance programs. Facilities newly subject to surveillance may turn out to harbor previously unsuspected infectious disease. The current trend toward incorporating additional facilities into monitoring programs could thus foster the impression of continued disease prevalence as detected by the percentage of positive samples processed by diagnostic laboratories. Because data are not available, no conclusions can be drawn; however, any impact of more institutions beginning to monitor will be diluted by the great majority of institutions that already have routine surveillance programs. In addition, there has been no impact from institutions initiating health monitoring programs for other diseases such as M. pulmonis and Sendai virus.",

What is the problem with continued low prevalence of subclinical infections, especially if the responsible scientists express little concern?\" There are at least two important problems raised by lowprevalence subclinical infections. First, any nidus of infection in any part of an institution poses a risk of contamination to the remainder of the facilities. Second, many research measurements are increasingly precise, and some, such as various cytokines, are exquisitely sensitive to perturbation from even subclinical and transient infection. Given that for many viruses there is a dose-response effect, that not all animals will be exposed to the same dose or in the same week, and that response to infection varies among individual animals, even subclinical infections can increase variability in all parameters they influence. As a result, there is a growing clash between investigators who study subtle variations in metabolic, immunologic, or transcriptional responses and others who are reluctant to endure the cost, research delays, or potential changes in their models that might result from infection eradication campaigns.",

Also, one of the most commonly used strains of mice, the C57BL/6, is relatively resistant to infection, requiring an infectious dose of 10-to 100-fold the dose for a BALB/c or CD-1 mouse (Besselsen et al. 2000; Shek et al. 2005) .",

Testing every animal may be necessary to exclude the possibility of infection, although the slight increase in parvoviral detection may not justify the increased costs.

But despite the substantial literature of parvoviral interference with research, it is sometimes difficult to garner the necessary commitment from principal investigators. Again, the low prevalence of parvoviruses is an important factor: in many instances, only a very small minority of animals are infected, and among these the systemic effects are often subtle and relevant to only a few research areas. Effects of the virus on infected cells may be more significant (productive infection is cytolytic), but very few cells are productively infected so the overall effect on a tissue can be small.

Contamination of entire lots of feed and bedding seems unlikely, given the generally localized nature of rotaviral contaminations (i.e., a single institution at a time), whereas contamination of entire lots of feed might reasonably be expected to result in nationwide outbreaks. A more probable, although unproven, mechanism of contamination is exposure of individual bags or pallets of feed or bedding to infected wild or feral mice. Mice have a keen sense of smell, and stored feed must be a powerful lure. Mice nesting on or near stored feed could easily contaminate the bags or contents with multiple agents. Nonenveloped viruses would be among the most likely infectious agents to survive time and desiccation, especially those shed in high quantities such as rotavirus.

At a minimum, it is advisable to disinfect the external surfaces of feed and bedding containers. However, based on a recent abstract describing incomplete inactivation of parvovirus on a cardboard surface (Lee et al. 2007) , spraying paper bags of feed and bedding with common disinfectants does not necessarily eliminate all risk. Rotaviral prevention strategies should also include personnel considerations such as personal protective equipment (PPE).",

Other infected populations of mice that could serve as occasional sources of TMEV contamination include wild or feral mice, pet mice, and mice raised as food for carnivorous reptiles, birds, and mammals. As with rotavirus, contamination of feed or bedding, especially the external surfaces of bags, could also be a source of TMEV infection. It is appropriate to test cell cultures and biologically derived reagents for TMEV as a matter of course, but PCR testing of thousands of cell cultures and other biological reagents at one major diagnostic laboratory did not find any evidence of TMEV contamination (CBC personal communication with KS Henderson, Charles River Laboratories, May 2007).",

Eradication of TMEV from research facilities depends on accurate detection of infected groups of mice, elimination of those that are infected (or shedding), and adequate cleaning and disinfection of contaminated materials. Prevention of recontamination entails the screening of incoming animals, disinfection of imported material, testing of biological materials, and proper use of PPE. Based on its moderate environmental stability, resistance to disinfection, and relatively long duration of shedding, the difficulty of TMEV eradication may be intermediate between that for parvovirus (more difficult) and rotavirus (less difficult).

In immunocompetent mice, enterotropic MHV causes clinical disease only in nursing pups of MHV-na\u00efve dams, so transmission of the virus by fomites contaminated by animals not known to be infected is likely a major reason for its continued prevalence.

In addition to their prevalence at institutions where they are tolerated, or where attempts at eradication have failed, several factors are probably responsible. These include continual reintroduction by feral rodents or from infections in recently arrived laboratory rodents, egg persistence in the environment, the lack of an ovicidal disinfectant for environmental decontamination, and inefficiencies in diagnosis. Together, these factors can contribute to movement of (undiagnosed) pinworm-infected animals between colonies or reinfection of colonies after successful treatment. An additional factor to consider is anthelminthic resistance, which is commonly reported in other species, although not, to date, in mice.",

A. tetraptera eggs are thought to be long-lived in the environment, remaining dormant for several months at 4\u00b0C (Stahl 1966) . Anya (1966a) reported, however, that culturing newly shed eggs at 37\u00b0C accelerated embryonation, decreased the number of viable eggs, and reduced their longevity. In a study to determine methods to inactivate viable S. muris eggs, 100% inactivation occurred only with temperatures of 100\u00b0C for 30 minutes and ethylene oxide, although high kill rates with formaldehyde and chlorine dioxide suggested that these chemicals could be successful with adjustments to the protocol (Dix et al. 2004 ). Huerkamp and colleagues (2000) reported the eradication of S. muris without environmental decontamination, suggesting that the eggs in the environment may not have outlived the treatment period (fenbendazole in feed every other week for five treatments). S. obvelata eggs appear to be unstable-they are reported to survive only 42 hours under ideal conditions, and may be inactivated by drying or immersion in liquids (Chan 1952; Grice and Prociv 1993) .",

Diagnosis in barrier caging systems usually relies on the detection of infection in sentinel mice exposed to soiled bedding (Brielmeier et al. 2006) . But there are many opportunities for failure. For instance, the collection of soiled bedding from only a subset of cages may miss infected cages, particularly in nonbreeding colonies housed in barrier caging where the prevalence of patent infection could be low. And when infected colony cages are sampled, fecal pellets in the soiled bedding sample may not contain eggs. Both S. muris and A. tetraptera exhibit cyclic egg excretion, although there is some question about the period of peak excretion-S. muris eggs are shed mostly in the afternoon (Van der Gulden 1967), while A. tetraptera eggs are variably reported as shed mainly at dawn (Phillipson 1974) or in the afternoon (Bunte and Nolan 2006) . Small bedding samples could easily miss the infected fecal pellets, particularly when one sentinel cage services many colony cages and there is pressure to take small samples of soiled bedding to avoid overloading the sentinel cage.",

Conversely, A. tetraptera has a long (minimum 23 days) prepatent period before eggs are shed (Anya 1966b) . Even when eggs are present in the bedding sample, they may be too new or too old to infect the sentinel: A. tetraptera eggs take at least 5 days to embryonate at 27\u00b0C, before which they are not infectious (Anya 1966a) , and S. obvelata eggs are reportedly inactivated by drying or by immersion in water (Chan 1952) . A further problem with sentinel testing lies in its retrospective nature. A positive sentinel pinworm test indicates exposure to pinworm-infected bedding some time during the exposure period, which typically lasts at least 3 months. By the time of diagnosis, the positive colony cage(s) may no longer be present or may have moved to another area, complicating decisions about the size of the risk group for treatment.",

Usual methods include flotation of fecal pellets in saturated salt or sugar solution for A. tetraptera (Baker 2007) and microscopic examination of clear cellophane tape applied to the anus (tape test) for Syphacia sp. (LeBlanc et al. 1993) . Although centrifugation dramatically enhances the sensitivity of simple flotation of fecal pellets, many such pellets from mice with patent infections may be egg-free. A 24hour cumulative sample is more definitive (Bunte and Nolan 2006) . Tape tests may yield false negatives due to cyclic egg excretion in S. muris (Van der Gulden 1967) or a mature infection in S. obvelata (Clarke and Perdue 2004) . As noted above, egg excretion decreases with increasing age and duration of infection (Behnke 1976 (Behnke , 2007 Chan 1952) . For example, Baker (2007) refers to a study in which only 15% of S. obvelata-infected mice were positive by tape test at 7 weeks of age, compared with 100% at 4 weeks. Given that sentinels are typically exposed to soiled bedding for several months, they may no longer be regularly shedding eggs by the time they are tested. In A. tetraptera, male mice harbor more worms than females (Behnke 1976 ) and worm count also varies by mouse strain (Derothe et al. 1997) .",

For example, S. obvelatainfected AKR mice mounted an increased antibody response to sheep red blood cells (Sato et al. 1995) , and S. obvelata-infected BALB/c mice immunized against ovalbumin showed an increased allergic response to antigenic challenge (Michels et al. 2006 ). It has also been suggested that early infection with helminths may reduce subsequent atopy by increasing the proportion of Th2 to Th1 responses, although this is unproven (Mao et al. 2000; Weiss 2000) . Studies have also demonstrated reduced incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in nonobese diabetic mice with other helminths (Cooke et al. 1999; Imai et al. 2001) due to a switch to Th2 dominant responses, and a similar effect can be predicted with pinworms for the same reason (Franke and Shirwan 2006; Michels et al. 2006) .",

Although apparently safe, treatment with oral fenbendazole was reported to reduce litter size in Sprague-Dawley (SD) but not GEPR-9 rats (Johnston et al. 2006) . Unfortunately, feed consumption and body weight were not measured, both of which could affect litter size. In addition, statistical significance was found only with continuous treatment of SD rats, in which there was dramatic difference in ages between groups: treated rats averaging 297 days of age produced smaller litters, whereas untreated rats averaging 142 days of age produced larger litters. Studies have found no effect (Barlow et al. 2005; Keen et al. 2005) or only minor effects of fenbendazole treatment on behavioral testing (Barron et al. 2000) .",

The lack of an ovicidal disinfectant remains a major problem, as does the challenge of locating and decontaminating equipment that may harbor pinworm eggs. It is particularly important to decontaminate biosafety cabinets and change stations to prevent them from serving as sources for widespread dissemination. For A. tetraptera outbreaks, steam cleaning or scrubbing surfaces with detergent at frequencies of less than 5 days (i.e., twice weekly) should prevent the transfer of embryonated eggs from one user to another via fomites.
