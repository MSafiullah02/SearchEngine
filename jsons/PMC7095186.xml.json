Through a review of completed willingness-to-serve forms, the President then identifies members with the expertise to address these issues and appoints them to committees or task forces that are assigned specific charges in respect to the issues. These members are volunteers\u2014staff nurses, RN first assistants, advanced practice nurses, educators, managers, industry nurses, and retired nurses\u2014who give their time to improve outcomes for their colleagues and patients. This year 265 members have worked diligently with the AORN staff to represent you through their work on our committees and task forces. The work of the committees and task forces for the year culminates in the proceedings at the Forums and House of Delegates sessions at the AORN Congress.",
