Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) polyproteins incorporate 16 protein domains (nsps), with nsp1 and nsp2 being the most variable among the coronaviruses and having no experimentally confirmed or predicted functions in replication. To determine if nsp2 is essential for viral replication, MHV and SARS-CoV genome RNA was generated with deletions of the nsp2 coding sequence (MHV\u2206nsp2 and SARS\u2206nsp2). Infectious MHV\u2206nsp2 and SARS\u2206nsp2 viruses were recovered from electroporated cells. The \u2206nsp2 mutant viruses lacked expression of both nsp2 and an nsp2-nsp3 precursor, but cleaved the engineered chimeric nsp1/3 cleavage site as efficiently as the native nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site. Replication complexes in MHV\u2206nsp2-infected cells lacked nsp2 but were morphologically indistinguishable from those of wild-type MHV by immunofluorescence. These results demonstrate that while nsp2 of MHV and SARS-CoV is dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, deletion of the nsp2 coding sequence attenuates viral growth and RNA synthesis. These findings also provide a system for the study of determinants of nsp targeting and function.",

In fact, the size and amino acid sequence variability of nsp2 across the different coronaviruses has led some investigators to speculate that the nsp2 protein, along with the nsp1 and nsp3 proteins, may play host-and/or cell-specific roles in the virus life cycle. [8] [9] [10] While this may be the case, it should be noted that nsp2, in some form, exists in all coronaviruses studied to date and likely plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle. A previous study from our laboratory identified a coronavirus replicase protein that plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. 11 Such may prove to be the case for nsp2, as well. Alternatively, beacuse nsp2 exists as a detectable precursor protein nsp2-3 prior to processing of nsp2 and nsp3 into mature proteins, nsp2 may play a critical adaptor/regulatory role for nsp3 function. Importantly, the viruses produced in this study provide a system by which the role of the nsp2 protein in viral infection can be characterized. ",
