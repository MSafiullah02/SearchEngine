Asthma is primarily characterized by airflow obstruction resulting from inflammation and remodeling of small airways. Asthma is a multidimensional disease, with several systemic manifestations, and it is associated with a number of co-morbid diseases (Pearce and Douwes, 2006). It is clear that much more clinical and basic research is needed to understand the complexity of asthma, so that more effective management of asthma and its various co-morbidities are possible in the future.",

(2006) indicated that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was significantly exacerbated by respiratory viral infections that caused reduction of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and airway inflammation. On assessing the effects of a winter influenza season on patients with COPD, Gorse et al. (2006) found that laboratory-documented influenza-caused illness was associated significantly with lower FEV1. Ko et al. (2007a) reported that the most prevalent viruses detected during acute exacerbations of COPD in Hong Kong were the influenza A virus and coronavirus. They indicated that among 196 patients with a mean age of 76 years, mean FEV1 was 40% of predicted normal and the FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio was reduced to 58% of normal. Singh and Busse, 2006, De Serres et al., 2009 also suggested that the influenza virus frequently causes acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD.",

A value of p\n < 0.05 was judged significant. To quantify the uncertainty and its impact on the estimation of expected risk, a Monte Carlo (MC) technique was implemented. The MC simulation algorithm depends on the statistics of input parameter and all possible distributions of parameters can be simulated considering random sampling of probability outcomes. The Monte Carlo simulation was performed with 10,000 iterations to generate 2.5- and 97.5-percentiles as the 95% CI for all fitted models. The Crystal Ball\u00ae software (Version 2000.2, Decisionerring, Inc., Denver, Colorado, USA) was employed to implement the MC simulation. Fig. 1\nillustrates the computational algorithm implemented in this study.",

Fig. 3\nillustrates the daily positive rate data of total respiratory viruses (including adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, and RSV) and influenza in the Taiwan region from 2001 to 2008. We found that Kaohsiung had relative higher annual mean values (8 years) of PM10 (~ 76 \u03bcg m\u2212 3), SO2 (~ 8 ppb), and O3 (~ 31 ppb) levels than Taipei (~ 50 \u03bcg m\u2212 3 for PM10, ~ 4 ppb for SO2, and ~ 24 ppb for O3), whereas there was no significant difference in CO (~ 0.7 ppm) and NO2 (~ 24 ppb) levels (Table 1\n, Fig. 2). The 8-year annual-average positive rates of total virus and influenza were estimated to be 13.55 \u00b1 8.73% (mean \u00b1 sd) and 6.50 \u00b1 7.22%, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 3).

Secondly, the reported data that we used were combined arbitrarily. They were used here to analyze observational data which have not been analyzed before. Finally, determining the probabilistic of future asthma episodes caused by influenza virus infection and air pollutants is challenging. It requires a synthesis of uncertainties along the cause-effect chain from viral infection and specific air pollutants to lung function variations. Velthove et al.

We also found that the probability of asthma admission can be limited to below 50% by keeping the correlation exponent of influenza (\u03b1\ni) below ~ 0.90. If the acceptable probability of exceedance were 50%, this would limit the annual asthma admission rate to 3425 per 100,000 populations or lower. We concluded that fluctuation analysis-based risk assessment provides a novel predictor for assessing the potential incidence of asthma.",
