These are health issues that transcend national boundaries to affect the health of people in rich and poor countries and require concerted international effort to address them. Many such issues arise from the impact of globalization on health, which serves to accelerate not only the transmission of communicable disease but also the spread of unhealthy products and lifestyles. Health in fragile states poses complex challenges for global health diplomacy, requiring even greater engagement with all parties. This need for wider engagement to create a global movement for health and to establish pathways through which multiple actors can work together is the common theme that emerges at many different levels. It heralds a new era of global health governance recognizing the voice and contribution of all parties.",

Conditions and diseases of global health have a major impact on health and the burden of disease in both rich and poor countries as Markle et al. ( 2007 ) elaborate.

MDG 8, calling for a new global partnership is relevant to the determinants of global health , it sets targets for establishing fair trading and fi nancial systems, meeting the UN target for aid fi rst agreed in 1970, working with pharmaceutical companies to ensure access to affordable essential medicines and with private sector partners to make the bene fi ts of new technologies including information and communications available to all.

This might appear straightforward when the objectives of cooperation are so clearly bene fi cial to all, but, as noted, the interests of states and other actors vary. Even in relation to global public goods for health, from which all bene fi t and none can be excluded as described in Chap. 8 , there is disagreement as to how responsibilities for action and funding are shared. States and other parties such as multinational companies may be happy to bene fi t from global public goods but unwilling to pay for them. Voluntary cooperation may be insuf fi cient to address such factors, a system of global agreement between all the parties is required, preferably supported by some form of international law. Thus, for example, surveillance of threats to global health is clearly a global public good for health and after some years of negotiation the responsibilities of states were set out in law as International Health Regulations. However, this has not been the end of negotiations as, for example, in the case of in fl uenza virus sharing by Indonesia (see Chap. 6 ).",

Kates and Katz ( 2010 ) examine 50 signi fi cant international health agreements, classi fi ed as legally binding treaties and executive agreements and protocols, non-binding agreements and commitments to UN organisations, agencies and programmes plus declarations, principles, other international agreements and partnerships. Of these only 36 had been joined by the USA and only 8 of the 21 legal binding treaties had been rati fi ed by the US Senate. Examples of such agreements include: the Millennium Development Goals, the Framework Convention on Tobacco control, the Doha declaration on Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement and Public Health and the Global Health Security Initiative. However, even when agreements are not legally binding or rati fi ed they may still have moral force and the weight of international public opinion, as noted in Chaps. 7 and 5 .
