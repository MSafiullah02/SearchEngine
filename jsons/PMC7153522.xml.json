As of March 28, 2020, no additional people have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in this investigation.

Moreover, if either a healthcare practitioner or resident from an LTCF becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2, a COVID-19 outbreak would be highly possible due to the close contact that occurs between LTCF caregivers and residents and the shortage of manpower or resources for infection control and prevention. Finally, an outbreak of COVID-19 in the LTCF could be associated with high morbidity and mortality due to resident characteristics (i.e., elderly patients with multiple comorbidities). Therefore, possible outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTCFs are of serious concern in the ongoing pandemic.",

A previous study investigating the knowledge surrounding SARS that consisted of interviewing 27 health care workers and 40 elderly residents in an LTCF found that most of the elderly residents were not well-informed about SARS and its prevention strategies, despite having access to the news through the media and visitors.22 In addition, the fear of a SARS outbreak was high among staff.22 Therefore, the authors suggested that education programs to promote awareness and prevention of SARS in a manner that is tailored to the elderly are needed. Additionally, more in-service training, support, and counseling are strongly suggested for the staff to promote disease prevention and improve the quality of care.22\n",

The WHO provides an interim guidance on IPC in LTCFs, which aims to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering the facilities, spreading within the facilities, and spreading outside the facilities.23 This IPC policy includes providing training to all staff, providing education for residents, auditing IPC practices, promoting hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, ensuring adequate supplies are available, and promoting physical distancing in the LTCFs.23 In addition, early recognition, isolation, care of COVID-19 cases, and source control are essential to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the LTCFs. The US CDC also suggests that each LTCF should develop a comprehensive response plan, consisting of restricting all visits, removing unnecessary healthcare personnel and canceling all group activities and communal dining.24 A daily report from the Expert Advisory Committee of COVID-19, presented a suitable example of how to respond to COVID-19 in LTCFs. On March 22, 2020, one nurse at a nursing home tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through local transmission. Subsequently, 81 doctors, nurses and residents in the LTCF were immediately tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all of them tested negative. Simultaneously, all the residents were moved to a nearby hospital and two quarantine locations to prevent further spread of COVID-19, and the LTCF was closed and disinfected. Authorities also identified an additional 14 people who had contact with the infected nurse before her diagnosis and closely monitored their clinical conditions. On Mar 29, 2020, a repeated test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative for the infected nurse and all the tests of the contacts were also negative.",

Appropriate IPC policies should be established in LTCFs and strictly adhered to in order to prevent this disease from entering these facilities and spreading within and outside of them.",
