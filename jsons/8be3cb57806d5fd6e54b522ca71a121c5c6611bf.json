Vaccinia virus as a vector for the full-length IBV cDNA has the advantage that modifi cations can be introduced into the IBV cDNA using homologous recombination, a method frequently used to insert and delete sequences from the vaccinia virus genome. Here, we describe the use of transient dominant selection as a method for introducing modifi cations into the IBV cDNA; this has been successfully used for the substitution of specifi c nucleotides, deletion of genomic regions, and the exchange of complete genes. Infectious recombinant IBVs are generated in situ following the transfection of vaccinia virus DNA, containing the modifi ed IBV cDNA, into cells infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gammacoronavirus that is the aetiological agent of infectious bronchitis (IB); an acute and high contagious disease of poultry. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which replicate in the cell cytoplasm. Coronavirus genomes consist of single stranded positive sense RNA, and are the largest of all the RNA viruses ranging from approximately 27-32 kb; the genome of IBV is 27.6 kb. Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of full-length cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered due to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving the insertion of a full-length cDNA copy of the IBV genome, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome in place of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. This was followed by the in situ recovery of infectious IBV in cells both transfected with vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [ 1 ] .",

A second and equally important advantage is the ability to modify the IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus vector through transient dominant selection (TDS), a method taking advantage of recombinant events between homologous sequences [ 3 , 4 ] . The TDS method relies on a three-step procedure. In the fi rst step, the modifi ed IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. In our case we use a plasmid, pGPTNEB193 ( Fig. 1 ; [ 5 ] ), which contains a dominant selective marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( Ecogpt ; [ 6 ] ), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5 K early/ late promoter.",

Vaccinia virus DNA is a very large molecule that is very easy to shear, therefore when working with the DNA be gentle and use wide bore tips or cut the ends off ordinary pipette tips. In addition always store vaccinia virus DNA at 4 \u00b0C; do not freeze as this leads to degradation. However, there is an exception to this if the vaccinia virus DNA has been extracted using the Qiagen QlAamp DNA mini kit, as this DNA will have already been sheared (the kit only purifi es intact DNA fragments up to 50 bp). This DNA can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C but it is only suitable for analysis of the rVV genome by PCR and is not suitable for the infection and transfection of CK cells for the recovery of rIBV.",

The recovery process is a low probability event and the serial passage of rIBVs in CK cells acts as an amplifi cation step.",

Integration of the complete pGPTNEB193 plasmid into the vaccinia virus genome results in an unstable intermediate because of the presence of tandem repeat sequences, in this example the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene, the S gene and the 5\u2032 end of gene 3. The second single-step recombination event is induced in the absence of MPA; loss of selection allows the unstable intermediate to lose one of the tandem repeat sequences including the Ecogpt gene. The second step recombination event can result in either (I) the original sequence of the input vaccinia virus IBV cDNA sequence, in this case shown as a recombination event between the two copies of the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene which results in loss of the modifi ed S gene sequence along with Ecogpt gene; or (II) retention of the modifi ed S gene sequence and loss of the original S gene sequence and Ecogpt gene as a result of a potential recombination event between the two copies of the 5\u2032 end of the S gene sequence. This event results in a modifi ed S gene sequence within the IBV cDNA in a recombinant vaccinia virus",

Vero cells are infected with rVV containing IBV cDNA and then transfected with a plasmid containing the IBV sequence to be inserted and the selective marker gene Ecogpt . Homologous recombination occurs and the complete plasmid sequence is inserted into the rVV. The Ecogpt gene allows positive selection of these rVV as it confers resistance to MPA in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. The viruses are plaque purifi ed three times in the presence of selection agents ensuring no wild type VV is present. The removal of the selection agents results in a second recombination event with the loss of the Ecogpt gene. Plaque purifi cation in the absence of selection agents not only ensures the loss of the GPT gene but also ensures the maintenance of a single viral population. Small stocks of rVV are grown from individual plaques which are screened through PCR for the desired modifi cation; this is found in theoretically 50 % of rVVs Screw-top 1.5 ml microfuge tubes with gasket.",
