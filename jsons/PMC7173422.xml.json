            "text": "The liver possesses two enzymic pathways for ethanol metabolism. The primary (constitutive) mechanism involves the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde (via alcohol dehydrogenase in the cytoplasm), followed by its oxidation (via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in the mitochondrion) to acetic acid. Acetic acid may then be released into the blood or converted to acetyl CoA. From this point, metabolism may flow along any of the standard biochemical pathways (Fig. 7.14). The second metabolic routing is activated only in the presence of high concentrations of ethanol. It involves an inducible enzyme (microsomal ethanol oxidizing system) that oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, using molecular oxygen. The activation of this system is undesirable because it generates free oxygen radicals. These are rapidly destroyed by superoxide dismutase and catalase in cells. Nevertheless, long-term exposure to the trace amounts of oxygen radicals that survive can result in the slow accumulation of irreparable cellular damage. The subsequent metabolism of the acetaldehyde generated by the microsomal system is identical to that derived by alcohol dehydrogenase. The conversion of ethanol to acetate (acetic acid) has the advantage that tissue cells can regulate its uptake. This is not true for ethanol, which can diffuse freely through cellular membranes. The control of the ingress of substances into cells is central to the maintenance of proper cellular function.",

Wine contains divers minerals in readily available forms, especially potassium and iron (in the ferrous state).

In addition to aiding food digestion, gastric juice inactivates enzymes involved in ulceration. Even more significant may be the effect of wine constituents on the bacterium Helicobacterium pylori. H. pylori is considered the primary cause of stomach ulceration. Thus, although wine cannot be considered an ulcer medication, moderate wine use appears to have a prophylactic effect in limiting ulcer development (Brenner et al., 1997).",

Most (\u223c80%) of the alcohol absorbed is taken up through the intestinal wall. Thus, by increasing the time wine stays in the stomach, food consumption effectively slows alcohol uptake. Consequently, the liver has more time to metabolize ethanol and, the maximum concentration reached in the blood is more likely to remain acceptably low. The rate of metabolism differs considerably among individuals, with rates commonly varying between approximately 90 and 130 mg/kg/h. The hormonal and nutritional state of the individual can also affect the rate of ethanol metabolism.",

Thus, most of the antimicrobial action of wine results from other constituents, notably its phenolic content. The modification of anthocyanin pigments during fermentation increases their toxicity to viruses, protozoans, and bacteria. Other phenolic compounds commonly found in red wines are also bacteriostatic and fungistatic. For example, p-coumaric acid is particularly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, whereas other phenols inhibit gram-negative bacteria, for example Escherichia, Shigella, Proteus, and Vibrio (Masquelier, 1988). Gram-negative bacteria cause serious forms of diarrhea and dysentery. Wine is even more effective than some standard antimicrobial agents, notably bismuth salicylate (Weisse et al., 1995). Thus, it is not without good reason that Roman armies added wine to their drinking water when they were out on compaigns. Red wine is also active against H. pylori (Fugelsang and Muller, 1996), the causal agent of the majority of stomach ulcers. Wine consumption is inversely correlated with active H. pylori infection (Brenner et al., 1997). The bacterium is also implicated in gastritis, vitamin B12 malabsorption, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Wine inhibits several gastrointestinal and respiratory tract viruses, such as the poliovirus, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Moderate alcohol consumption has also been correlated with a reduced incidence of the common cold in nonsmokers (Cohen et al., 1993).",

These have shown that people who consume moderate levels of alcohol on a daily basis have a significantly reduced incidence of the expression of various stages or forms of cardiovascular disease, for example hypertension (Keil et al., 1998), heart attack (Gaziano et al., 1999), stroke (Truelsen et al., 1998; Hillbom, 1999), and peripheral artery disease (Camargo et al., 1997). Those who consume wine moderately live, on average, 2.5 years longer than teetotalers, and considerably longer than heavy drinkers. The prime area of contention in these investigations is whether most of the benfits accrue from the alcohol or phenolic content (Rimm et al., 1996). That ethanol easily passes into the blood stream is clear. What is less understood is the permeability of the intestinal wall to wine phenolics.

            "text": "Arteriosclerosis apparently results from chronic injury to the arteries (Fig. 12.3\n). Although associated with several independent factors, most seem to function primarily via the oxidation of lipids in a special subgroup of cholesterol\u2013apoproteins complexes, the low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). Because of the hydrophobic nature of cholesterol and triglycerides, their transport in the blood requires a special transport vehicle. As illustrated in Fig. 12.4\n, lipoprotein complexes consist of an outer membrane of phospholipids, in which apoproteins and free cholesterol occur. They enclose a hydrophobic core possessing numerous triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. The specific apoproteins in the complex regulate the metabolism of the associated lipids. Oxidized lipids are cytotoxic and indirectly irritate the artery wall. They also promote the adherence of various blood proteins to the artery wall. In addition, oxidized lipids activate helper T-cells. They, in in turn, induce macrophages (a scavenger form of white blood cell) to migrate into the artery wall. The macrophages engulf oxidized LDLs, giving the cell the appearance of being full of bubbles. This has given rise to the term foam cells. They initiate localized arterial swelling (plaques). Gradually, oxidized lipids induce the smooth muscle of the artery wall to proliferate. Additional LDLs slowly continue to collect in the artery wall. These accretions may develop their own vasculature, and become fibrous and inelastic. They generate the irregular protrusions into the artery lumen that restrict blood flow and can provoke the various forms of peripheral artery disease. They also set the stage for platelet aggregation, clot formation (thrombus), and the blockage that can precipitate a heart attack or stroke. If the initiators of chronic artery-wall irritation, such as smoking, high blood pressure, high dietary sources of cholesterol, and certain chronic bacterial infections, for example Chlamydia pneumoniae, can be removed, arteriosclerosis appears to be at least partially reversible. Part of the reversal relates to elevated levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). They remove cholesterol that has accumulated in the arteries. These lipoproteins are the \u201cgood\u201d (HDL) blood cholesterols, in contrast to the \u201cbad\u201d (LDL) blood cholesterols, which incorporate fats into the artery wall. The slower the turnover rate of LDLs, the greater the likelihood of oxidation (Walzem et al., 1995). Moderate wine consumption, notably of red wines, increases the concentration of HDLs, decreases the level of LDLs, and increases the rate of their degradation (turnover) in the blood.",

There is also direct evidence that resveratrol can enter the blood system at levels sufficient to have a physiological effect in reducing the action of cyclooxygenases and 5-lipooxygenase (Bertelli, 1998) as well as acts as a phytoestrogen. In addition, resveratrol activates proteins involved in nerve cell differentiation, synaptic plasticity (important in learning), and neuronal survival (Tredici et al., 1999). Additional potent antioxidants in wine are flavonols, such as quercetin, and tannin subunits, such as catechin (Miller and Rice-Evans, 1995). They not only are more effective antioxidants than resveratrol, but also occur at higher concentrations. Their content depends partially on the duration of maceration and fining used in wine production. For example, fining with PVPP (polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) markedly reduces the quercetin content (Fluss et al., 1990).",

Thus, it is not surprising that inhibitors of platelet aggregation reduce the frequency of these cardiovascular events. It is the rationale for recommending the daily consumption of ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation). Ethanol has a platelet inhibitory action (Renaud and Ruf, 1996), as well as phenolics found in red wine (Fig. 12.5\n). Many flavonoids, such as catechin, epicatechin, and quercetin, markedly inhibit platelet aggregation (Keli et al., 1994). This may be a consequence of the production and release of nitric oxide by endothelial cells of blood vessels. This can be activated by the exposure of endothelial cells to grape extracts (Fitzpatrick et al., 1997). Nitric oxide induces vasodilation (by relaxing vascular smooth muscle), decreases platelet aggregation, and limits platelet adhesion to blood vessel endothelia. Indicative of the complexities of these effects is the observation that flavonoids also inactivate nitric oxide (Verhagen et al., 1997). Nitric oxide, notably as peroxynitrile, oxidizes LDLs. Resveratrol also been noted to decrease the adhesion of blood constituents that promote platelet aggregation to vessel walls (Bertelli, 1998).",

Gout is caused by localized crystallization of uric acid in the joints and the associated inflammation. This frequently results as a consequence of reduced excretion of uric acid by the kidneys. Wine can occasionally aggravate the situation as a consequence of alcohol metabolism; the lactic acid produced as a result reduces uric acid elimination by the kidneys. Alcohol can also raise blood uric acid level, by promoting purine breakdown (the prime source of uric acid). In this regard, wine is less likely to induce gout than beer, due to wine's lower purine content. Nevertheless, medical historians suspect that lead-induced kidney damage was the primary cause of the gout epidemic during the nineteenth century (Emsley, 1986\u20131987; Yu, 1983). Samples of port from the 1800s show high lead contents. Lead pickup from stills (used in making fortifying brandy) probably was the primary source of the contamination. In addition, pewter and lead-glazed drinking cups and the prolonged storage of wine in lead crystal decanters could have further augmented the lead content of port.",

At the concentrations typically found in wine, ethanol has an inhibitory effect on the carcinogenesis of ethyl carbamate. Certain wine phenolic compounds also can be protective, whereas others, or a higher concentration, can be mutagenic. For example, quercetin can induce mutations in laboratory tissue culture, but is a potent anticarcinogen in whole-animal studies (Fazel et al., 1990). This apparent anomaly may result from differences in the concentrations of quercetin used, and the low level of metal ions and free oxygen found in the body (vs. tissue culture). In addition, phenolics can detoxify the small quantities of nitrites commonly found in food. However, in the presence of high concentrations of nitrite (a preservative found in smoked and pickled foods) nitrites are converted into diazophenols (Weisburger, 1991), which can induce oral and stomach cancers. Resveratrol can inhibit the production of cyclooxygenase-2, thought to be important in carcinogenesis (Subbaramaiah et al., 1998). It also is a major inhibitor of human P450 1A1 (Chun et al., 1999), an important aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase that can convert environmental toxicants and procarcinogens into active carcinogens. In addition, flavones and flavonols strongly restrict the action of the common dietary carcinogens, heterocyclic amines (Kanazawa et al., 1998). It is estimated that these compounds, produced during cooking, are consumed at a rate of approximately 0.4 to 16 \u03bcg per day (Wakabayashi et al., 1992). The antiallergic and antiinflammatory properties of flavonoid phenolics probably also contributes to the anticancer aspects of these chemicals (see Middleton, 1999).",

It could explain the rapid onset of an asthma attack because the absorbed sulfite is transported via the blood to the bronchi. At potentially a greater risk are individuals afflicted with a rare genetic disease, sulfituria (Shih et al., 1977; Crawhall, 1985). They are unable to produce active sulfite oxidase. Consequently, they must live on a very restricted diet, low in sulfur-containing proteins. It is estimated that the synthesis of sulfite, associated with normal food metabolism, generates approximately 2.4 g sulfite/day. The sulfites in wine contribute only marginally to this amount. Because of the gravity of sulfituria, most affected people die before reaching legal drinking age.",

Migraines may be induced by a wide range of environmental stimuli, possibly because migraines are themselves a complex of etiologically distinct events. The dilation of blood vessels in the brain, as a result of histamine release, can be the common element in many instances of headache development. When red wines were discovered to have higher concentrations of biogenic amines, such as histamine and tyramine, there was the initial assumption that they were the culprit. However, it was later realized that the histamine levels normally found in red wines are below those that normally could trigger a migraine. In addition, double-blind studies have seemingly exonerated histamine in red-wine-induced migraine headaches (Masyczak and Ough, 1983). Nevertheless, alcohol can suppress the action of diamine oxidase, an important enzyme of the small intestine that inactivates histamine and other biogenic amines (Jarisch and Wantke, 1996). Thus, in individuals with histamine intolerance, sufficient histamine may enter the blood system to provoke a vascular headache.",

            "text": "Although the biogenic amine content of wine appears to be insufficient to cause migraines in most individuals, tannins and other phenolic compounds in wine can provoke headache development. Because red wines contain significantly more phenolic compounds than white wines (\u223c1200 mg/liter vs. 200 mg/liter), red wines are more frequently associated with headache production. Phenolic compounds that enter the blood stream suppress the action of platelet phenolsulfotransferase (PST) (Jones et al., 1995). Thus, individuals initially having low levels of platelet-bound PST are more susceptible to migraine headaches (Alam et al., 1997). The suppression of PST activity results in reduced sulfation (inactivation) of biogenic amines and catacholamines. Thus, these compounds are more likely to stimulate the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, or serotonin), which acts as an important neurotransmitter in the brain. 5-HT also promotes platelet aggregation and the dilation of small blood vessels in the brain. This can cause pain and instigate the development of a migraine (Pattichis et al., 1995). People prone to migraine headaches occasionally show abnormal and cyclical patterns in platelet sensitivity to 5-HT release (Jones et al., 1982; Peatfield et al., 1995). This may explain why wine consumption is not consistently linked to headache induction. Small phenolic components in wine also prolong the action of potent hormones and nerve transmitters, such as histamine, serotonin, dopamine, adrenalin and noradrenaline. These can affect headache severity and other allergic reactions.",

However, the real cause of the detrimental effects observed in FAS is unknown. The problem is complicated because alcoholic mothers also tend to be heavy smokers, use illicit drugs, consume large amounts of coffee, have poor nutrition, or show a combination of these (see Scholten, 1981; Whitten, 1996). Although there is no absolutely safe level of alcohol consumption, or of consumption for any food for that matter, there now seems no reason to suspect that taking a glass of wine with meals should harm the developing fetus. A small amount of alcohol is periodically found in the blood due to the action of the natural bacterial flora in the intestines. Thus, alcohol is a natural component in the human diet, even if we never drink a beverage that contains alcohol.",

For the majority of the adult population, however, moderate wine consumption appears to have considerable health benefits. Nevertheless, there are several situations in which wine consumption, even in moderate amounts, can complicate or diminish the effectiveness of disease treatment.1.The acidic nature of wine can aggravate the inflammation and slow the natural healing of ulcers in the mouth, throat, stomach, and intestinal tract. Other constituents in wine may also be detrimental in this regard. Thus, all beverages containing alcohol are usually contraindicated in cases of gastritis, gastric cancer, and bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Nevertheless, the action of red wine against H. pylori and the suppression of histamine production by the gastric mucosa (Masquelier, 1986) may require a reconsideration of the old prohibition. In the presence of pancreatitis, alcohol is absolutely contraindicated.2.In liver disease, the consumption of wine is normally contraindicated. The presence of alcohol puts additional stress on an already weakened vital organ. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to cirrhosis of the liver.3.In acute kidney infection, wine should be avoided. The consumption of alcohol increases the burden on an organ essential to eliminating toxic metabolic wastes.4.In prostatitis or genitourinary infections, the consumption of alcohol can complicate matters. The diuretic action of wine may increase the frequency of urination or, conversely, it may induce highly painful urinary retention.5.In epilepsy, the consumption of even moderate amounts of wine may increase the frequency of seizures in some patients.6.In patients about to undergo surgery, the generally beneficial effect of alcohol on reducing the aggregation of platelets is undesirable. Thus, it is recommended that patients terminate any alcohol (as well as aspirin) consumption before surgery. This avoids increasing the incidence of intra- and postoperative bleeding (Wolfort et al., 1996).\n",

Alternatively, the peppery flavor of some tannins or the sharp bite of marked acidity may enhance food flavor\u2014similar to the role of spices.

Examples of some of the more well-known opposed combinations are the associations of port with Stilton cheese, Sauternes with Roquefort cheese, venison with auslese, Sancerre with goat cheese, and crab with chablis. The rationale for the combination of sweet, richly flavored wines (ports and sauternes) with salty, creamy blue cheeses (Stilton and Roquefort) seemingly relates to their similar richness and the blend of salt and sweetness. The complexities of their flavors integrate, enhancing mutual enjoyment. In Germany, the gamey character of well-aged venison is considered to be counterbalanced by the sweet, rich flavors of a fully mature \u2018Riesling\u2019 Auslese. In the Loire, the aggressive dry acidity of Sancerre is viewed as counterpoised when taken with the racy goat cheeses of the region. Finally, the sourness of Chablis is deemed to be offset by the sweet flavor of crab.

Because most basic food ingredients exhibit neither sour nor bitter tastes, there is little obvious logic in their association with food. However, food does depress the sour, bitter, and astringent aspects found in many table wines. Proteins in food have already been mentioned as minimizing the sensory impact of tannins and acids in wine. This results in the wine tasting smoother, less sour, and better balanced. Thus, in many cases, it is the food that enhances the perception of the wine, rather than the reverse. Nevertheless, the acidity of wine tends to freshen the mouth, whereas moderate bitterness and astringency can enliven bland foods.",

For example, the predominant flavor qualities of wines, such as fruitness, floral notes, vegetal, and oaky aromas, are rarely found in the basic ingredients of a meal. Conversely, common food flavors are seldom found in wines. Occasionally, however, a flavor component of a wine may complement a similar essence in the food. Examples are the nutty aspect of cream sherries and a walnut dessert, or the oaky character of wines and the smoke flavors of meat roasted over hardwood charcoal.",

The rule focuses attention on balancing savory, dark-colored meats with flavorful red wines, and the milder-tasting, pale-colored meats and fish with the delicacy of most white wines. Regrettably, the expression glosses over the effects of cooking techniques and condiments on food flavor. The adage also neglects the influence of other important aspects of flavor perception, namely its complexity, development, and duration. Occasionally, however, a mild wine may be chosen to moderate strong food flavors. Conversely, a delicate food may be chosen to highlight the complex subtlety of a well-aged red wine. It is much easier to indicate situations in which wine and food will clash, than suggest sublime combinations.",

The next course could be a light citrus sherbet, or terrine, principally to cleanse the palate and prepare for the entree. Because the entree is customarily a meat dish, one or a number of red wines would be served. Typically, the youngest wine is served first and the oldest last. This retains the oldest and most subtle wine for the last; otherwise, the younger wines would appear increasingly rough and undistinguished.
