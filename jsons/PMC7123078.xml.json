Effective treatment, however, was not possible at that time; prevention and spread of infectious diseases depended solely on proper hygienic means. At the beginning of the twentieth century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.). Thanks to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (by Paul Ehrlich) and antibiotics (by Sir Alexander Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimised. Large-scale vaccination programmes against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough, and polio), started in the early 1950s, raised hopes of finally being able to eradicate these diseases from the planet. This approach was successful for smallpox (1980). However, new infectious diseases have emerged [e.g., Legionella, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV), Helicobacter, SARS, etc.], and new vaccines and antibiotics are needed. Furthermore, due to intensive medical treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, hospital infections are a growing problem. Bacteria hitherto deemed harmless are causing OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS in immunocompromised patients. The pathogens have developed resistance to many antibiotics, and sometimes no effective antibiotics are available to treat these patients.",

ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES are widely expressed as part of the professional phagocyte antimicrobial arsenal and rapidly induced at epithelial surfaces. They are found in mammals, invertebrates, and plants. In general, they are small, amphipathic molecules, contain positive charge, and can be structurally divided into several categories. The mode of action goes beyond their antimicrobial capacities, and they elicit a complex array of responses in different cell types. The most extensively studied mammalian gene families are the cathelicidins and DEFENSINS. In general the ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES disrupt lipid membranes and thereby induce microbial killing. Micro-organisms have developed several countermeasures against ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES, but the many structurally different peptide classes still provide protection against infection (Table 10.1).",

The ingestion by phagocytic cells of the micro-organism is enhanced by serum proteins (opsonins), such as ANTIBODIES and the C3b component of complement, which are recognised by specific RECEPTORS on the PHAGOCYTES. After ingestion, the particle is surrounded by the membrane of the phagocyte, forming a vacuole known as a PHAGOSOME. The PHAGOSOME then fuses with some of the countless granules in the phagocyte, thus allowing the lysosomal microbicidal agents and enzymes to do their work. The formation of toxic oxygen radicals greatly contributes to the killing and elimination of the ingested micro-organism (Fig. 10.1) (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-10811-3_8).",

They differ from one another in size, charge, amino acid composition, and glycosylation (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-10811-3_4). In principle, the structure of the ANTIBODIES is the same, i.e. two heavy and two light chains: it is the variable part of these chains that recognises the micro-organism. The biological function (see below) is determined by the constant part (Fc) of the heavy chain. With the exception of IgD, all these ANTIBODIES are important in antimicrobial activity. IgA, which is found in all external secretions, reacts with the surface of micro-organisms, preventing them from adhering to sensitive cells and mucous membranes. IgG neutralises microbial toxins.IgG, IgM, and C3b serve as opsonins, which promote phagocytosis.IgG, IgM, and to a lesser extent IgA activate the complement system after binding to the micro-organism. Activation products C3a and C5a ensure that the phagocytes are attracted to the inflammatory response.IgG and IgM, in combination with complement and lysozyme, have a lytic effect on Gram-negative bacteria and enveloped viruses.IgG and IgM inhibit the mobility of micro-organisms by attaching specifically to the flagellum. Thereby the chance of phagocytosis increases, and the chance of spreading of disease decreases.IgG, together with the killer or K cells, can eliminate infected host cells which carry viral or other foreign antigens on their surface. IgE is of importance in parasite infections. At the site of the infection, mast cells, bearing specific IgE, release large quantities of vasoactive amines, which cause the contraction of smooth muscle tissue and increase the permeability of the blood vessels. In the intestine, this results in worms being detached and eliminated.",

The TLR family members are coupled to a signalling adapter protein (MyD88) and form differential dimers that may explain the discrete responses to TLR ligands such as lipoproteins, heat SHOCK proteins, unmethylated CpG DNA, viral dsRNA, and bacterial flagellin. Intracellular signalling involves several kinases depending on the TLR involved and includes the MAP kinase and NF-\u03baB pathways leading to a cellular response. PAMP for TLR2 include a variety of agonists derived from Gram-positive organisms such as PEPTIDOGLYCAN and lipoteichoic acid. Therefore, it seems that TLR2 and TLR4 are activated primarily by different PAMP to initiate the host response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infection, respectively. This is further illustrated by the fact that TLR2 (but not TLR4) knockout mice are highly susceptible to GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA, like Staphylococcus aureus, whereas TLR4 (but not TLR2) knockout mice are highly susceptible to Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium.",

LPS-hyporesponsive TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice are made responsive by transfer of MACROPHAGES of a closely related LPS-sensitive strain. When the host is challenged with LPS, soluble factors are produced by MACROPHAGES that mediate fever and an acute-phase response. These factors include the pro-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Together, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 stimulate endothelial cells to produce and express proteins on their membrane that have adhesive properties for LEUKOCYTES, promoting the margination and passage of neutrophils from blood vessels through the endothelial layer, leading to neutrophil influx into the tissue. ADHESION MOLECULEs that mediate the binding of neutrophils appear on the endothelium after an inflammatory stimulus, followed by molecules that are specific for adhesion of MONOCYTES or LYMPHOCYTES, which may be why NEUTROPHILS enter before mononuclear cells. Molecules that are currently known to be involved in leukocyte-endothelium interactions belong to three structural groups: the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, the integrin family, and the selectin family.",

The CD4 molecule, together with other RECEPTOR molecules, like chemokine RECEPTOR CCR5, acts as a binding site for the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of the virus. In an attempt to respond to HIV ANTIGENS and concomitant secondary microbial infections, these cells are activated, thus inducing the replication of HIV in the infected CD4 T cells, which are finally destroyed. In contrast, HIV-1 infection of MACROPHAGES is self-sustained and results in an inexorable growth of chronic active inflammatory processes in many tissue compartments including the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. Infected cells bear the fusion protein gp41 and may therefore fuse with other infected cells. This helps the virus to spread and accounts for the multinucleated cells seen in lymph nodes and brain. As a result of the decreased numbers of CD4+ Th cells and defects in antigen presentation, depressed immune responses in these patients are observed. During the progression of the disease, OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS by otherwise harmless micro-organisms can occur. These include Candida albicans oesophagitis, mucocutaneous herpes simplex, toxoplasma in the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, and pneumonia caused by toxoplasma and Pneumocystis carinii; Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma also occurs frequently in these patients. This has been linked to the presence of a previously unknown type of herpes virus (HHV-8). This immune deficiency syndrome is called \u2018acquired immune deficiency syndrome\u2019 (AIDS). It has been suggested that infected MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES carry the HIV virus into the brain where it replicates in microglia and infiltrating MACROPHAGES. As a consequence, many AIDS patients develop cognitive and motor brain impairments. However, the picture is complicated by the various persistent infections already present in these patients, which give rise to their own pathology in the brain.

Treatment of infected individuals is possible but expensive. HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (HAART) reduces morbidity and mortality among patients infected with HIV (see Fig. 10.5). Success is limited by the emergence of drug-resistance viruses that can be transmitted to newly infected individuals. Resistance, drug toxicity, and poor patient ADHERENCE lead to treatment failure and necessitate continuous development of alternative treatment strategies that intervene with the HIV replication cycle: i.e. on the level of virus entry, critical viral enzymes [reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and proteases (PR)], or viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein. At this moment a triple therapy is being prescribed in Western countries (two RT inhibitors and one PR inhibitor, Fig. 10.4), each of which interfere with specific steps in the process of HIV replication. One major problem that has arisen is the increasing resistance to these drugs. Agents with novel MECHANISMS OF ACTION provide options for patients with DRUG-RESISTANT virus. Blocking of the chemokine RECEPTOR CCR5, a co-RECEPTOR on CD4 cells for HIV, is an alternative treatment for persons infected with the R5 HIV type. This notion is supported by a recent finding that a homozygous defect in this chemokine RECEPTOR accounts for resistance of multiple-exposed individuals to HIV-1 infection. Currently a commercially available drug is being used that specifically binds to CCR5 on the surface of the CD4 cell and selectively blocks HIV-1 binding. One remarkable HIV patient, known as the \u2018Berlin patient\u2019 and on an antiretroviral therapy for 10 years, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia and therefore received a haematopoietic stem cell transplant from a donor with the \u2018resistant\u2019 CCR5 receptor.

Von Behring and Kitasato were the first to demonstrate that the source of the protective activity induced by vaccines was present in blood serum. Von Behring was also the first to prove that protective immunity could be passed on via serum. The development of new vaccines had its ups (yellow fever) and downs (tuberculosis).

C1). Today, thanks to new insights into the IMMUNE SYSTEM and modern molecular biological and chemical techniques of analysis and synthesis, it is possible to produce well-defined vaccines. These contain only those determinants of the PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISM that induce protection ( EPITOPES). These EPITOPES are usually short peptide or oligosaccharide chains, which can be produced synthetically or by means of RECOMBINANT DNA techniques. The immunogenicity of these products can be enhanced by coupling them to a CARRIER (tetanus toxoid, liposomes) and/or by adding an adjuvant (a substance that strengthens the immune response non-specifically). The RECOMBINANT DNA technique can also be used to obtain attenuated strains of micro-organisms, which are fully immunogenic and thus provide protection but which are no longer virulent. One example of this is the development of a new cholera vaccine based on a bacterium that has all the characteristics of a virulent strain, except the toxin. The bacterium has retained all its ADHERENCE factors, which allow it to adhere to the intestinal mucosa; the length of time it spends in the intestine is sufficient to stimulate the local IMMUNE SYSTEM. The newest trend in vaccinology is immunisation by introducing plasmid DNA into the host. Success has been attained by this method for hepatitis B vaccination. An example that holds a combination of modern techniques has been developed to combat Malaria, a communicable disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite that is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. P. falciparum causes the highest rates of complications and mortality and is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, especially young children. Besides many alternative strategies to combat the spread of malaria, vaccination is a long-going approach. A promising candidate vaccine combines the circumsporozoite coat protein fused to hepatitis B surface antigen exposed on the surface of self-assembled virus-like particles together with immunomodulatory adjuvants. It has been shown to induce an immunogenicity profile in controlled human malaria infection model and field studies in sub-Saharan Africa.",

Targeting soluble factors (like neutralisation of bacterial toxins and viruses) or common structures (like bacterial adhesins or viral entry factors) in high-risk patient groups may be beneficial alone or may enhance the therapeutic EFFICACY of other drugs. Targets for clinical development of MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES include multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci, Bacillus anthracis toxin, HIV, HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Therapeutic application of human monoclonal antibodies is boosted by their proven success for various cancers. Molecular cloning and efficient in vitro production by cell lines enable customising antibody properties like IgG subclass, glycosylation pattern (to chance effector functions like complement activation, receptor triggering, or half-life), or coupling with toxins, antibiotics, and inhibitors. Renewed optimism for treatment of HIV is encouraged by uncovered naturally arising, broad, and potent HIV-1-neutralising antibodies. It is a challenge to select the best monoclonal antibody (or cocktail) that not only depends on its capacity to recognise HIV broadly, but may also relate to the kinetics of the antibody epitope expression on infected cells. Understanding the molecular complexity of the neutralising antibody repertoire towards the main antigenic determinant of the influenza virus, the HA surface glycoprotein, is important to design a future vaccine that can elicit long-term broadly protective antibodies to a variety of different strains.

The eradication of smallpox (Variola major) virus in the 1970s was a milestone for the World Health Organisation. The next goal of the WHO is to eradicate poliovirus in the coming years. Major problems to be dealt with are the distribution of these vaccines, the costs involved, the registration and the compliance of the vaccines, and molecular techniques to trace the final bug. Meanwhile new unexpected microbiological threats become in focus. Hospital infections caused by multiresistant micro-organism due to the abundance use of antibiotics and exchange of genetic material between micro-organisms impose major problems on patients and healthcare workers. New antibiotics and/or vaccines should be developed and new strategies employed to contain these infections. Due to crowding and the high mobility of the world population, old and new pathogens, e.g. influenza and SARS, threaten our society. The recent influenza A H1N1 (\u2018Mexican\u2019) flu outbreak in 2009 demonstrated how rapidly a new strain of flu can emerge and spread around the world. The sudden outbreak of this novel flu virus has tested the world\u2019s public health preparedness. In the Netherlands, Q fever emerged with large epidemic outbreaks. Q fever is a zoonotic disease that is passed from infected (farm) animals (cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary carriers) to humans. Q fever is a disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and faeces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. C. burnetii is resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, allowing it to survive for a long time in the environment. People can become infected by inhalation of the bacteria, but the risk of infection is low. Only about one-half of all people infected with C. burnetii show signs of clinical illness (e.g. flu-like illness, pneumonia, and hepatitis). Q fever can be treated with antibiotics, and most people will recover fully. As a control measurement, pregnant goats on dairy farms had to be killed, and a mandatory vaccination campaign was started. Since May 2015, Zika virus infection spread from Brazil to other countries in South and Middle America as well the Western Hemisphere. Although most infections are unnoticed or only follow mild symptoms like fever and rash, in pregnant women, the infection may cause microcephaly. This is a birth defect where a baby\u2019s head is smaller than expected and the brain is not developed properly. Zika virus was recently (1947) identified in a rhesus monkey and is spread by the bite of an infected yellow fever or dengue mosquito which are not endemic in the Netherlands. Currently no vaccine or specific medication is available, but new vaccine candidates elicit neutralising antibodies in mice and non-human primates providing protection against Zika virus infection. Since March 2014, the largest outbreak of Ebola virus in history has affected multiple countries in West Africa, especially Guinea and Sierra Leone. Ebola virus causes a grotesque haemorrhagic fever syndrome that is associated with high mortality in humans. The virus originates from an infected animal (like bats) and may jump to a person where it is easily transmitted by direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids. Infected people were placed in quarantine, but the lack of treatment capacity and isolation facilities hampered an efficient response. The infection caused major loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in the region. The international community responded with funds, specialists, equipment, and training. Two years later the outbreak has been brought under control, and only an occasional flare-up occurred. The frightening reputation of the disease has re-emerged the efforts to produce a vaccine. A recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based candidate vaccine, expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire ebolavirus, proved to be protective in animals including non-human primates. Although this vaccine candidate was not yet officially approved, an emergency stockpile was produced. A field \u2018ring vaccination\u2019 (after the outbreak) trial proved to be effective in localised infections. This encouraged new opportunities to develop robust and safe new vaccine strategies to combat Ebola virus outbreaks. High-throughput sequencing and epitope mapping, high-resolution proteomics, and single-cell antibody-cloning techniques combined with computational methods are applied to map both natural and elicited epitope targets of antibodies in a given individual. This guides both structural vaccinology approaches and development of protective immunisation with specific human monoclonal antibodies.",

The global initiative known as the Human Microbiome Project (started in 2007) aims to catalogue this balance. It is now realised that each person has a unique mix of bacteria and much of the diversity in healthy subjects remains unexplained.
