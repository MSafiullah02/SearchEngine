More\nrecently, there has been a growing academic and policy interest in connecting\nchallenges of a majority urbanised world to questions of health and disease,\nincluding Ali and Keil\u2019s\n(2008) edited collection, Networked Disease: Emerging Infections\nin the Global City, as a ground-breaking publication (see also Elsey et al., 2019; Moore et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2017). Meike\nWolf\u2019s (2016)\nresearch on urban epidemiology also takes forward the debate surrounding the role of\nchanging geographies on urban health and disease. Furthermore, a recent article by\nBollyky (2019) has\nmore explicitly noted that the future of global health is urban health. Recognising\nthese emerging conversations, we are specifically interested in this paper in new\nways in which infectious disease is bound up with processes of\nextended urbanisation, paying particular attention to the\nsocio-ecological flows and disruptions leading to an increased incidence of\ninfectious disease in peri- or suburban areas.",

As we discuss, LPE approaches are\ncrucial to understanding the metabolic processes and socio-environmental\nimplications bound up with extended forms of urbanisation. The concept of metabolism\nrefers to the combination of social and natural processes to form socio-natural\nlandscapes (Swyngedouw and\nHeynen, 2003). We posit that, while rapid and intensive forms of\nurbanisation (densification) are seen as enabling factors for the spread of\ninfectious disease (Munster et\nal., 2018), it is important to study extended urbanisation because\npatterns of urban sprawl and expansion are more likely to lead to infectious disease\noutbreaks, as opposed to cities, which are generally assumed to reduce the incidence\nof infectious disease for inhabitants (see Wood et al., 2017). This is, in part,\nbecause urban expansion might expose sub- and ex-urban areas to higher levels of\nbiodiversity (and disease sources) than are found in central urban areas (Kaup, 2018). Cities also\nhave better health facilities and resources which can enable faster response times\nand enhance containment of disease outbreaks.",

In demonstrating\nthis argument, we highlight three key factors influencing the distribution of\ninfectious disease burden that have been identified in the literature on this topic\nwithin various strands of urban studies. These interrelated dimensions are mobility\nand demographic change, infrastructure and governance. There are certainly more\nfactors that could be identified (e.g. deforestation and climate change) but these\nthree themes have been most prominent in the literature on urbanisation and\ninfectious disease, and also relate closely to processes of extended\nurbanisation.1 We have kept these themes intentionally broad to capture as much\nof the disparate work that exists on this topic as possible. Moreover, we consider\nhow these factors influence different phases of infectious disease management, from\ndisease prevention to mitigation and control of outbreaks, and possible\nresponses.",

At the top of the list of these concerns are usually obesity\n(especially amongst young people), diabetes and heart disease (Hamblin, 2014).\nImportantly, attention has now also shifted to mental health related to suburban\nlife, for example in emerging work on people living with dementia in suburban\nenvironments (Biglieri,\n2018). Much of the literature on chronic disease has, as the tacit\nstarting point, the notion of \u2018epidemiological transition\u2019. That is, the\nargument that in Western, industrialised societies, more individuals are living\nto older ages, which consequently leads to increased incidence and prevalence of\nchronic diseases associated with (sedentary) \u2018lifestyle\u2019 and \u2018ageing\u2019, as\nopposed to infectious diseases. Bloch and co-authors (2013: 96) of\ncourse warn: \u2018A closer examination of urban risk shows, in fact, that \u201csprawl\u201d\nis not the problem, but rather the lack of adequate land use planning policies\nand infrastructure provision in rapidly growing and expanding settlements.\u2019",

However,\nsuch findings are not wholly conclusive, as research has also pointed to certain\nfeatures of urban life that benefit the health of urban dwellers, including the\navailability of social support and better access to health and social services\n(Bollyky, 2019).\nCurrent health research does conclusively demonstrate, however, that one aspect\nof the built environment is detrimental to good health, namely, living in\nsprawling suburban neighbourhoods (Freudenberg et al., 2005; Frumkin et al., 2004).\nWhat has made this question more complicated is exactly the tendency, invoked in\nour usage of extended urbanisation and post-suburbanisation, of blurring the\nclassical lines of distinction of city and suburb, town and country.

Thus, for example, it was\nin this light that in 1967 the US Surgeon General publicly declared that it was\n\u2018time to close the books on infectious diseases\u2019 and to shift all national\nattention to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (Garrett, 1994: 33).\nRecent developments, however, appear to indicate that this may be premature as\nwe now appear to face an onslaught of what are referred to as new and\n(re)emerging diseases (Garrett, 1994; Haggett, 1994; Mayer, 2000; Morse, 1996).",

UPE examines the multitude of socio-natural flows into and out of the\ncity, often referred to as \u2018urban metabolism\u2019, including biophysical, technical,\nsocial and economic exchanges (Gandy, 2004; Loftus,\n2006; Swyngedouw,\n2006). Kaika and colleagues have also recently proposed a distinctive\nsuburban political ecology lens which has considerable overlap with the perspective\nput forward here in our combined use of landscape and urban political ecologies\n(Tzaninis et al.,\n2020). As Coker et\nal. (2011: 599) have elaborated, cities are home to \u2018dynamic systems in\nwhich biological, social, ecological and technological processes interconnect in\nways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches\u2019. Moreover, \u2018the\nparticular sociopolitical contexts and spatial configuration of urban regions have\nstrong implications for how these various non-human natures are urbanised\u2019 (Connolly, 2019). For these\nreasons, landscape political ecology becomes an extremely useful tool for\nunderstanding the political, social, economic and cultural relationships between\nurban environments and public health.",

This is seen most\nclearly in rapidly urbanising regions such as Africa and Asia, which have\nexperienced recent outbreaks of Ebola and SARS, respectively. Projections by\nurban scholars hold that sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s urbanisation rates are higher than\nanywhere else in the world as the urban population in the region \u2018is expected to\nquadruple, from 295 million to 1.15 billion\u2019 (Angel et al., 2017: 169). Twelve million\npeople now live in Kinshasa, capital of the DRC, which is three times the\ncombined population of the cities affected by the 2014 outbreak in West Africa\n(Yong, 2018).\nEqually, regional towns in the DRC, where some of the recent Ebola cases have\nbeen recorded, have also been expanding, some under the influence of conflict\nand war.

Jakarta, to take another example, is projected to\nbecome the largest city in the world in coming decades, with much of the\npopulation made up of rural\u2013urban immigrants. Numerous researchers have thus\nnoted that population density \u2013 which is highest in cities \u2013 strongly influences\nthe likelihood of a disease outbreak (Ali and Keil, 2007; Alirol et al., 2010;\nCoker et al.,\n2011). For instance, Wilkinson and Leach (2015) have noted\nthat the dense urban areas and slums in Monrovia and Freetown, Sierra Leone,\nhave been prime sites where Ebola has thrived. While suburban areas are\npopularly understood as low density areas, such processes of extended\nurbanisation in developing regions often consist of densely populated \u2018new\ntowns\u2019 of high-rise flats or peri-urban informal settlements with high densities\n(see Mabin et al.,\n2013). Such cases indicate the importance of a landscape political\necology lens in examining urbanisation and infectious disease, as it is often\nthe lack of physical infrastructure coupled with political-economic factors\nresulting in high density in such places that provide perfect scenarios for the\nspread of microbes.",

Why,\nthen, was there a change from rural to urban outbreaks after this time and in\nthis particular region? One factor is the high degree of population movement on\nthe continent, which is seven times higher than anywhere else in the world\n(WHO, 2015). This\nmigration is driven by a myriad of social and political-economic factors that\nforce people to travel daily in search of food or work; extended families with\nrelatives living in different countries; the traditional practices of returning\nto a native village to die and be buried near ancestors; as well as travel to\ntraditional healers who have the trust of community members (WHO, 2015).

As discussed above, urban political\necology approaches also discuss the ways in which governance decisions result in\nunequal and spatialised patterns of disease whereby particular spaces and\npopulation groups face a disproportionate burden of disease for various reasons\n(Rose, 2007;\nSarasin,\n2008).",

They further put in place the\n\u2018administrative machinery for disease prevention\u2019 and protection of public\nhealth (Rosen, 2015:\n47). As Keil and Ali\n(2011) found, it was typically conventional containment strategies,\nsuch as isolation and home quarantine, that proved most successful for\ncontrolling the spread of SARS in affected cities. As they note, this is based\non the view of the bounded city with fixed, territorialised and restricted\naccess, which contrasts with the unbounded and \u2018topological\u2019 character of\ncontemporary urbanisation processes. The coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic that\nspread just as we were completing this paper sparked the \u2018largest quarantine in\nhuman history\u2019, resulting in the isolation of entire cities and regions (Gollom, 2020). Wuhan\u2019s\nurban periphery also became the setting for a \u2018pop-up\u2019 construction of a\n1000-bed hospital facility to deal with affected patients. As Wuhan is locally\nknown as the \u2018thoroughfare of China\u2019 (Huifeng, 2020), such spatial factors\naccount for the need for a landscape political ecology approach that can\ninterrogate the relationships between social actors across multiple spatial and\ntemporal scales.",

The attention to socio-ecological metabolisms also allows for understanding\nhow outbreaks of zoonoses and other emerging infectious diseases can be triggered by\nthe expansion of urban settlements in previously forested or agricultural areas. For\ninstance, the aforementioned outbreak of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) first\ncrossed the animal\u2013human divide at a market in Wuhan, one of the largest Chinese\ncities with 11 million people. As in the SARS pandemic of 2003, the connectivities\nof accelerated urbanisation, heightened mobilities and more extensive zoonotic risks\nbecame immediately apparent (Ali\nand Keil, 2008).",

This course of events, continuing as we complete this paper, urges urban\nresearchers to seek new and better explanations for the relationships of extended\nurbanisation and the spatialities of infectious disease. This will require an\ninterdisciplinary approach including geographers, health scientists, sociologists,\nwhile also developing possible solutions to prevent and mitigate future disease\noutbreaks. As we have argued, landscape political ecology approaches can contribute\nto this goal by helping to identify the political-economic and biopolitical factors\ninfluencing the spread of disease through a range of spatial scales in an age of\nextended urbanisation.",
