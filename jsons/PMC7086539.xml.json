One challenge is to achieve longitudinal studies in newborn infants, especially if born preterm, due to the need of repeated blood sampling over a short period of time in infants already at risk of being compromised and with a low circulating total blood volume. A study of preterm baboons showed rapid telomere attrition rate during the first year of life and measured in parallel the turnover of hematopoietic stem cell types and found longer telomere length in T cells compared to granulocytes and B cells at birth. This difference disappeared at 2 years of age. They concluded that there was a biphasic pattern of stem cell turnover with an initially rapid cell division that declined during the second year of life and similarly a rapid telomere attrition during the first year of life that subsequently slowed down.16",

Cross-sectional measurements in adolescents show similar telomere length for preterm born and healthy term born children, with longer telomeres in girls irrespective of prematurity and a negative correlation to lung function, that could not be explained by perinatal events.3 We have previously reported a study of 10-year-old preterm born children with a history of BPD compared to a group of term born children with asthma showing that the strongest predictors for short telomeres at age 10 years were impaired lung function and male sex, rather than prematurity alone.20",

The control group were healthy children born at term (gestational week 37+0\u201341+6) on the same day as the index child and matched for sex and maternal smoking. The protocol included blood sampling at two time points: cord blood at birth and peripheral blood at follow-up at 2 years of age. Respiratory infections during the first year of life were monitored. Parents kept a diary and were instructed to report to the hospital for clinical evaluation when their child showed symptoms of infection. Nasopharyngeal sampling for viral infections (adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus (Oc 43, 229 E, NL 63, HKU1), enterovirus, rhinovirus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydia pneumoniae) was performed at every infection episode and analyzed by routine PCR methods at Karolinska University Hospital Laboratory.

Each reaction contained: 17.5 ng DNA, 1\u00d7 PCR buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 150 nM Rox (Molecular Probes), 0.2\u00d7 SYBR Green (Roche Diagnostics GmBH), 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 1.7 mM MgCl/2.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT; TEL reaction) or 2.5 mM MgCl/5 mM DTT (HBB reaction), and TEL/HBB primers (TEL 1b, 100 nM: CGGTTTGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTT and TEL 2b, 900 nM: GGCTTGCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCT, or HBB3, 400 nM: TGTGCTGGCCCATCACTTTG and HBB4, 400 nM: ACCAGCCACCACTTTCTGATAGG).

TEL/HBB (T/S) values were calculated by the 2\u2212\u0394Ct method, where \u0394Ct = CtTEL \u2212 CtHBB. The RTL value for each sample was generated by dividing the sample\u2019s T/S value with the T/S value of a reference cell line DNA (CCRF-CEM) included in all runs. A standard curve generated by the reference cell line DNA was also included in each run to monitor PCR efficiency. The mean inter-assay coefficient of variation for RTL measurements in our laboratory is between 4% and 8%.",

In a recent publication by Olin et al. we showed that preterm infants have higher levels of CD4+ T cells and lower levels of neutrophils compared to term born infants at birth but these differences normalize early in life.30 We still do not know exactly how cell composition develops and affect telomere length and within what time frame from a viral infection a change in telomere length could be detected.

Standard of care for extremely preterm born infants in Sweden include management for pain relief, parental involvement with both skin-to-skin care and supporting parental\u2013infant bonding from the moment of birth as well as having the parents stay at the ward together with their infants around the clock, from admission to discharge from the hospital. Breastfeeding is also promoted and all infants born preterm in our cohort received bank milk if mother\u2019s own milk was not available. More than half of the infants born term were exclusively breastfed at 4 months of chronological age. Wojcicki et al. showed in 4-year-old children that exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of age was correlated to longer telomeres.31 In our study, breast milk was highly available for both term and preterm born infants early in life and do not explain the longer telomeres we found in preterm infants. Wojcicki et al. also measured change in telomere length from birth to 2.4 years of age with a yearly change of \u22120.08 \u00b1 0.6,32 which correspond to the same telomere attrition rate for term infants that we found in our study. Despite spending 5\u201310 weeks after birth at the hospital and being exposed to more severe respiratory tract infections during the first year of life, preterm infants in our cohort had longer telomeres than term born infants and cellular aging was not accelerated. The low neonatal morbidity and very close parental involvement might elude some of that stress-related telomere erosion described by Provenzi et al. in infants in need of neonatal intensive care.",
