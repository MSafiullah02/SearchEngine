The drugs studied include Chloroquine, Ivermectin, Remdesivir and \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine (DMFO). Our results indicate that these small drug molecules selectively bind to stable, kinetically active residues and residues adjoining them on the surface of proteins and inside protein pockets, and that some prefer hydrophobic over other active sites. Our approach is not restricted to viruses and can facilitate rational drug design, as well as improve our understanding of molecular interactions, in general.",

The latest worldwide rapidly spreading disease, COVID-19, is caused by a new member of this virus family, SARS-COV-2. The disease originally emerged in China in December 2019 with most common symptoms being fever and cough, as well as shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, muscles ache, nausea, and diarrhea [1] . In some cases initial symptoms also involve a still unexplained loss of smell and taste [3] . The SARS-COV-2 virus spreads through respiratory droplets, directly via physical contact, or through contact with contaminated objects, and can severely affect patients with immune systems weakened by preexisting conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases [4] . The virus has lower fatality rate than SARS and MERS, but spreads more easily due to high binding affinity between the virus spike glycoprotein (S) and the host receptor [5] [6] [7] [8] , making it, potentially, more deadly. The virus is therefore a primary cause or initiator of a significant number of deaths all over the world. By restricting access to work and slowing down supply lines the virus also directly affects the global economy, which experiences a significant decline in gross national products worldwide and unemployment rates reaching levels not encountered since the Great depression.",

            "text": "As this manuscript is being prepared there are several efforts and clinical trials underway to develop a vaccine and evaluate potential drugs for COVID-19, but such investigations usually take months or even years to yield a successful treatment. Drug repurposing, on the other hand, may offer an immediate solution, because it considers already approved compounds as potential treatments for COVID-19. There are two paths toward a viral treatment. One path directly attacks the virus and interrupts its replication machinery or its ability to attack host cells [9] . This path is often hard to implement due to rapid emergence of new viral strains with acquired resistance to implemented drugs. The second path should therefore aim to block the host-viral interactions on the host side due to difficulties viral single point mutations should have in recovering the loss of host factors [10] . A recent study of human-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) detected 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs [11] . The study showed that 40% of SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with endomembrane compartments or vesicle trafficking pathways, and that viral proteins also interact with multiple innate immune pathways, the host translation machinery, bromodomain proteins, enzymes involved in ubiquitination regulation, and Cullin ubiquitin ligase complex. Importantly, it showed that the SARS-COV-2 human PPI map is very similar to the interaction maps of West Nile Virus (WNV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Among the human proteins involved in interactions with viral proteins, the study detected 66 druggable human (host) proteins targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds). It identified two groups of compounds with noticeable antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation/protein biogenesis (zotatifin, ternatin-4, PS3061, and plitidepsin), and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors (Haloperidol, PB28, PD-144418, Hydroxychloroquine, Clemastine, Cloperastine, Progesterone, and the clinical molecule Siramesine). The first group of compounds directly affects the viral cap-dependent mRNA translation because coronaviruses use the host translation machinery for their own mRNA translation. The compounds affecting the second group of proteins are approved and long established human therapeutics [11] . As much as they are informative, such screening associative studies rarely offer detailed insights into mechanisms of molecular interactions, whereas structural studies [5] [6] [7] [8] 12] give snapshots into residue and atom level physical interactions between molecules, but cannot offer general principles of molecular interactions.",

Other kinetically active sites although exposed to solvent are not binding targets. The analysis of Chloroquine's nondiscriminatory binding to human and parasitic proteins may offer an explanation of its efficiency against parasitic infections as well offer a glimpse into its toxicity. Our results suggest that Chloroquine's binding to Covid-19 proteins should follow the same patterns of attachment to residues which are both hydrophobic and kinetically active (or close to kinetically active sites).",

The structure reveals that the double stranded RNA is inserted into RdRp's central channel and that the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir is covalently bound to the primer strand at the first replicated base, which effectively terminated the chain elongation. It shouldbe noted that the prodrug form of Remdesivir does not have any inhibitory effect on the polymerization activity of the purified enzyme [12] . Our analysis reveals that the residues recognized via the fastest two normal modes (corresponding to kinetically active residues [28] ) delineate the central channel ( Figure 3 ). The enzymatically important residues K500, S501, K545 and R555 are all recognized by the SAGNM algorithm using just the fastest normal mode, while the residue D761 of the catalytic center (out of residues 759-761 that form the catalytic center) is also emphasized with the two fastest modes. Residues K545 and R555 are important because they stabilize the incoming nucleotide in the correct position for catalysis. The crystal structure shows that the catalytic center of RdRp, NSP12 protein (Non Structural Protein 12), does not have any contacts with base pairs of RNA emphasizing RdRp's sequence-agnostic polymerization ability [12] .

The structural alignment of HCV and Covid-19 RdRp ( Figure S1d ) shows that they share the structure of the binding pocket, and also reveals that the catalytic cores in both are bounded by kinetically active residues, but the overall distribution of residues is partially different between the two proteins ( Figure S1e ).

We therefore need not only to develop an effective and efficient treatment for the current pandemic, but also have to design a set of protocols to address all future, similar pandemics. In this manuscript we presented our strategy to recognize potential drug binding residues in human and viral proteins. We analyzed four currently approved drugs (Chloroquine, Ivermectin, Remdesivir, and Eflornithine). Our results indicate that small, drug like compounds preferentially bind to kinetically active and adjoining residues, thus seeking stable residues characterized by fast normal modes with small amplitude of fluctuations [28] . Some drugs preferentially seek active patches that are hydrophobic (Chloroquine, Ivermectin), while others prefer hydrophilic surfaces (Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Eflornithine). We can postulate that in water environment drugs binding to hydrophilic patches will be more stable, as their removal will lead toward the reduction in structural entropy, but a full account of this proposition will require calculations of binding free energy differences based on full atom molecular dynamics, using, for instance, steered molecular dynamics simulations (SMD) [31] . We can also propose that the drugs/small molecules that bind to deep pockets will be more stable, and thus more effective. Our algorithm accurately recognizes such pockets as binding spots for drugs (Figure 3 ), and small peptides (see, in particular, Figure 6a in [28] ).",

For Remdesivir we analyzed its binding patterns in the recently released structure [12] (pdb id 7bv2). We also performed the analysis of binding pattern of drug Sofosbuvir to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp (pdb id 4wtg) and compared them to the Covid-19 RdRp predictions (pdb id 6m71). Sofosbuvir was already analyzed in light of similarities between HCV and SARS-COV-2 RdRp and similarities between Remdesivir's and Sofosbuvir's [29] . For \u03b1-Difluoromethylornithine we analyzed a structure of Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) with D-ornithine bound to it (pdb id 1njj). \u03b1-Difluoromethylornithine binds to the active site of ODC and inhibits ornithine binding to it. We performed the comparative analysis of the binding patterns between the ACE2 human receptor and the spike glycoproteins from SARS (pdb id 6cs2) and SARS-COV-2 (pdb id 6moj).
