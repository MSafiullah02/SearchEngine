            "text": "The primary objective of this study was to estimate variance components and heritability of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) incidence in beef calves before weaning and during the finishing phase. The second objective was to investigate the impact of BRD incidence and treatment frequency on performance and carcass traits. Bovine respiratory disease is the biggest and most costly health challenge facing the cattle industry. The 2 populations used consisted of 1,519 preweaned calves and 3,277 head of feedlot cattle. The incidence rate of BRD in preweaned calves was 11.39%, and among treated cattle, 82.1% were treated once, 13.9% were treated twice, and 4.0% were treated 3 times or more. The incidence of BRD (P = 0.35) and the number of treatments (P = 0.77) had no significant effect on weaning BW. Heritability estimates of the entire preweaned population for BRD resistance and number of treatments were 0.11 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.08 \u00b1 0.05, respectively. The genetic correlation estimates for BRD incidence with weaning BW and birth BW were low (\u22120.02 \u00b1 0.32 and 0.07 \u00b1 0.27, respectively). The same estimate for the number of BRD treatments with weaning BW and birth BW was 0.25 \u00b1 0.35 and 0.30 \u00b1 0.27, respectively. The observed BRD incidence rate for feedlot cattle was observed at 9.43%. Incidence of BRD significantly (P < 0.01) decreased overall and acclimation ADG by 0.06 \u00b1 0.01 kg/d and 0.28 \u00b1 0.03 kg/d, respectively. Carcass traits were also significantly (P < 0.05) affected by BRD incidence; untreated cattle had a 9.1 \u00b1 1.7-kg heavier HCW. Results were similar in the analysis of treatment frequency. The heritability estimate of BRD incidence and the number of treatments were 0.07 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.02 \u00b1 0.03, respectively. Estimates of genetic correlations of BRD incidence with production traits were \u22120.63 \u00b1 0.22 for acclimation ADG, \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.23 for on-test ADG, \u22120.31 \u00b1 0.21 for overall ADG, \u22120.39 \u00b1 0.21 for final BW, \u22120.22 \u00b1 0.22 for HCW, \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.22 for LM area, 0.24 \u00b1 0.25 for fat, and \u22120.43 \u00b1 0.20 for marbling score. Similar results for the number of treatments and production traits were \u22121.00 \u00b1 0.68 for acclimation ADG, \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.39 for on-test ADG, \u22120.47 \u00b1 0.41 for overall ADG, \u22120.66 \u00b1 0.40 for final BW, \u22120.58 \u00b1 0.45 for HCW, \u22120.12 \u00b1 0.38 for LM area, 0.42 \u00b1 0.50 for fat, and \u22120.32 \u00b1 0.37 for marbling score. Because of the high economic cost associated with BRD incidence, even these modest estimates for heritability of BRD resistance should be considered for incorporation into beef cattle breeding programs.",

These 3 factors converge in the typical beef production system at nearly the same time. Common viral agents that are implicated in BRD include infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza type 3.

Feedlot cattle diagnosed with BRD had significantly (P < 0.01) less ADG during the acclimation period (1.22 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 1.50 \u00b1 0.02 kg/d); however, no significant effect was observed on ADG during the on-test period (P = 0.72). The length of the acclimation period averaged 37 d in the current study. This time period represents the most critical period because most BRD incidences occurred during or directly after this time period within the population under study. Overall ADG was adversely affected (P < 0.01) by treatment for BRD; treated cattle gained 0.06 \u00b1 0.01 kg/d less BW when compared with untreated cattle. These results indicate that BRD incidence has a detrimental effect on ADG, especially early in the finishing period. In addition, because cattle that were treated for BRD have a decreased reduction in ADG when considering the entire feedlot phase compared with the acclimation period, perhaps cattle properly treated for BRD are able to more closely match the performance of untreated cattle after the effects of infection have been minimized.",

Carcasses from cattle treated had lighter HCW (9.15 \u00b1 1.68 kg; P < 0.01) compared with healthy cattle (Table 2 ). This result may be explained by the effect of BRD incidence on ADG, which subsequently leads to lighter final BW at a constant age. Treated cattle were also leaner (11.43 \u00b1 0.23 mm vs. 12.35 \u00b1 0.14 mm; P < 0.01) and had smaller marbling scores (5.49 \u00b1 0.06, small 49 vs. 5.59 \u00b1 0.04, small 59 ; P < 0.05).

This is a definite advantage when compared with cattle in the other number of treatment categories (1 = 72.2%; 2 = 71.1%; 3+ = 72.2%).

These results indicate that selecting for BRD resistance may be more feasible in Angus cattle within this population compared with the Simmental breed. Possible differences in the heritability estimates between breeds are likely due to breed differences observed in terms of additive genetic variances, rather than phenotypic variances (Table 4 ). Within this population the additive genetic variance for Angus cattle is considerably larger with relatively similar estimates for phenotypic variance seen between both breeds. Phenotypic and genetic correlations among BRD incidence, number of BRD treatments, weaning BW, and birth BW were estimated from records on the entire population (Table 5 ). The phenotypic correlations between all traits were low, ranging between \u22120.04 and \u22120.00. The genetic correlation estimates for BRD incidence with weaning BW and birth BW were low (\u22120.02 \u00b1 0.32 and 0.07 \u00b1 0.27, respectively). However, slightly greater genetic correlation estimates were obtained for the number of BRD treatments with weaning BW and birth BW (0.25 \u00b1 0.35 and 0.30 \u00b1 0.27, respectively). These estimates of genetic correlations between number of BRD treatments and BW traits may have implications for selection decisions. Selection for reduced birth BW is favorable for reduced number of treatments; however, selection for increased weaning weights may lead to an increased number of treatments for BRD in preweaned calves.",

The heritability of BRD incidence estimated within this study was observed with a disease rate of 9.43%, which is approaching the lower end of the incidence expectation, and there is evidence that as incidence rate is increased, heritability estimates are increased (Snowder et al., 2006) .",

Though the heritability estimate for BRD was small, results here illustrate that breeding programs could be developed to incorporate BRD resistance into selection programs for improving cattle health to ultimately increase profit potential.
