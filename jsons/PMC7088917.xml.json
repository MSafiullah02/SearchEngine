Past pandemics have ranged in disease severity, from the devastating \u201cSpanish flu\u201d of 1918 (Johnson and M\u00fcller 2002) to the comparatively mild \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d of 1968 (Kilbourne 2006). Nonetheless, all pandemics have exerted a considerable and global impact on society, including a death rate exceeding those of seasonal influenza outbreaks. The SARS outbreaks of 2003 (Fan and the Asian Development Bank 2003) demonstrated the great potential for social and economic disruption caused by the spread of a lethal pathogen. There is every reason to expect that an influenza pandemic will have a very significant impact when it arises.",

In fact, it is unlikely that an effective vaccine will even be available during the first six months of a pandemic (Webby and Webster 2003). During this time antiviral drugs will be the first line of defence for pharmaceutical intervention, and several countries have been stockpiling such drugs, mainly oseltamivir (tradename Tamiflu) (Ward et al. 2005). These stockpiles are being widely used in the ongoing outbreaks of H1N1 both to treat known cases and to prevent the establishment of known outbreaks by treating the close contacts of cases. The currently circulating viral strain is mild making it hard to tell if the drugs are effective either in ameliorating symptoms or in reducing onward transmission. The widespread use of drugs for prophylaxis on a national scale would be prohibitively expensive, and so, in the UK and US pandemic plans, for example (US Dept of Health and Human Services 2005, UK Department of Health 2007), the primary role of oseltamivir is for therapeutic (post-symptomatic) treatment. Treatment by oseltamivir of seasonal influenza, taken within 48 h of symptoms, alleviates and shortens the duration of symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of mortality (McGeer et al. 2005), and it is hoped that the drug will have the same effect against a pandemic influenza virus.",

Specifically, if a stockpile is potentially insufficient for all clinical cases, should we treat only priority cases in an effort to preserve the drug supply, or should treatment continue to be dispensed to as many clinical cases as possible until the stockpile is exhausted? UK policy is in line with the former; at first all symptomatic cases will receive treatment and, if supplies run low, drugs will be prioritised for health care workers and those most at risk (UK Department of Health 2007). This policy makes sound intuitive sense, but is it the best way to minimise morbidity and mortality? Is it consistent with a principle of just allocation of limited resources?",

Infectious disease dynamics are intrinsically \u201cnonlinear\u201d, meaning, for example, that an epidemic started by two infectious individuals is not twice as large as one caused by a single individual. The fundamental issue here is that drug treatment protects those taking the medicine and gives some protection to people they might otherwise have gone on to infect. This preventive effect is clearly positive, but it can lead to complex balances between treatment strategies that are good for the individual versus strategies that are good for the community.",

For instance, young adults suffered a higher mortality rate than any other age group in the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d pandemic of 1918 (Jordan 1927). In such a scenario, we argue that prioritizing the treatment of those at most risk of death is not always in agreement with minimising infection and overall numbers of deaths.

A notable feature of this graph is that aggressive policies are not always more drug-consuming than conservative ones. For example, in the case R\n0 = 1.5, fewer drugs are dispensed overall if 90% of infected cases receive treatment than if only 60% do. This is because the potential benefits of treatment are not limited to those individuals receiving it; by accelerating their recovery, treatment also shortens their infectious period, and thus reduces the spread of disease, leading to fewer cases overall. If dispensed to sufficiently many cases, therefore, this effect can in fact reduce the overall number of drugs needed. In the extreme case of R\n0 = 1.2 and with over 60% of cases receiving treatment, the treatment programme is effective in stamping out infection before it can spread widely and hence only a very small number of drugs are used. However, such an effect is, as one might expect, dependent on the viral transmissibility and on the drug efficacy. For a highly transmissible virus and/or a poorly effective drug, antiviral usage always increases with coverage, as in the example R\n0 = 2 in the diagram.\n\n",

We can now consider how the picture might change if there were only a limited stockpile. This is implemented in the model by imposing zero antiviral coverage once the drug usage exceeds a given stockpile level. Say, for example, that there are enough drugs for a quarter of the population, as in the current US and UK stockpiles. Figure 2 shows how the epidemics would progress according to this model, for different coverage policies, assuming that R\n0 is 1.7 (a moderate value). An aggressive 95% coverage exhausts the stockpile, but a conservative 30% coverage avoids doing so. On these grounds alone the latter might appear preferable. Nonetheless, the epidemic peak is significantly reduced and broadened by the aggressive policy. Analysis of this model, presented in detail elsewhere (Arinaminpathy and McLean 2008), also shows that although an aggressive policy exhausts the stockpile, it results in fewer cases overall than the conservative one.\n\n",

Here the public health planner, faced with the potential exhaustion of a stockpile, must choose between an assured supply of drugs, but a greater overall number of cases and pressure on health services, and on the other hand minimising the overall disease burden, but potentially denying treatment to those infected towards the end of the epidemic. This is particularly true if no vaccine, or alternative treatment, is available when the stockpile has been exhausted. This seems a likely scenario, given that it will take at least six months from the start of a pandemic for a effective vaccine to be available (Webby and Webster 2003). Any problem of resource allocation is burdened with a trade-off between the interests and welfare of individuals. In this case, however, the tension between the consequentialist approach (driving the aggressive coverage policy) and equitability (a key guiding principle in many pandemic plans) is amplified by the underlying disease dynamics.",

Further parameters are given in the figure legends. In the first scenario, depicted in Fig. 3, the drug is effective in both the general population and in the risk group, at reducing transmission and mortality. The ridges in the plotted surfaces correspond to policies under which the exhaustion of the stockpile coincides with the end of the epidemic. With any greater coverage in either group the stockpile would be prematurely exhausted. The first main point to note is that the policy for minimising mortality is not the same as that for minimising attack rate (numbers infected). For the former (see Fig. 3a), drugs should be prioritised for risk-group cases and any remaining stockpile used for the general population. For the latter (see Fig. 3b), the opposite is true and the general population instead takes priority. Despite this contradiction, most non-fatal infections of influenza do not result in lasting disability, and so many would argue that the policy to minimise overall mortality should take precedence over the policy to minimise numbers infected.\n\n\n",

This situation is not implausible: clinical features of serious human cases of H5N1 have raised questions about the potential efficacy of oseltamivir for these cases (WHO 2007). Here, minimising mortality agrees with minimising overall numbers of infections: prioritise treatment for the general population, and spend any remaining drugs on the risk group cases. It must be stressed that this is not merely a matter of \u201cabandoning\u201d the risk group as a result of their poor response to treatment: this policy also offers indirect protection for risk group members. Specifically, because the drug performs so poorly in the risk group, rather than aiming to protect these cases against mortality through direct treatment, it becomes more important to protect them against infection. This is achieved by investing the drugs in the general population, where treatment has the strongest effect in reducing disease spread. Evidence of this dynamic is seen in the fact that the policy for minimising mortality coincides with that for minimising numbers of infections.",

At first glance it seems clear that this favours prioritising symptomatic treatment for those most at risk. However, we have seen that a policy to minimise mortality should be guided not only by the effect of the disease itself, but also by the drug efficacy in different groups of the population. As we have shown, in cases in which antivirals have low efficacy in high risk populations, it is possible for the community-wide effect of treatment in the general population to offer more protection than direct treatment of high risk-group members. In this case, is it more \u201cjust\u201d to prioritise the general population, if necessary even denying treatment to those hardest hit by a pandemic? There are two reasons to think that denial of treatment of the worst off is consistent with a Rawlsian \u201cmaximin\u201d theory of justice of prioritizing the worst off. Firstly, control of infection spread might be regarded as being as much a \u201cpublic good\u201d as availability of the drugs themselves. Secondly, by denying low efficacy treatment of high risk symptomatic individuals, drugs can be used to maximally reduce the spread of disease and so indirectly benefit those most at risk (though not those symptomatic) by reducing their chances of contracting the disease. Under such constraints, justice paradoxically requires denial of treatment of the worst off, in favour of preventing infection of those most at risk.",

Nevertheless, if a virus should emerge in South-East Asia, effective and rapid case analysis during this time could well provide valuable data with which to guide antiviral deployment in other countries. Our discussion does not offer direct solutions for this uncertainty; nonetheless, it highlights the need for continuous, accurate surveillance, and illustrates how this information could usefully inform an antiviral deployment strategy.",

Nor have we considered the possibility of presymptomatic postexposure prophylaxis and its impact on spread and overall mortality. In any case, the strength of the modelling approach presented here lies not in its quantitative predictions, but its capacity for providing heuristic insights, and these are likely to remain valid in yet more detailed models.
