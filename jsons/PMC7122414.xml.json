            "text": "A major time-consuming\nprocess in nearly all structural and functional studies of proteins is their overproduction and purification. Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli has become the most popular platform for researchers who require large amounts of protein. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) with a polyhistidine tag (usually six consecutive histidine residues) has emerged as the most common and convenient method for purifying recombinant proteins. However, many His-tagged proteins form insoluble aggregates, especially in E. coli [1]. Before abandoning bacterial expression in favor of more complicated and costly eukaryotic systems, we suggest employing a simple strategy that combines the solubility-enhancing benefit conferred by E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) [2, 3] with the powerful advantage of IMAC [4], made possible by the use of a polyhistidine tag in a tandem configuration with MBP (His6-MBP) [5]. In this chapter, we describe how to construct either a His6-tagged or His6-MBP tagged fusion protein and conduct a few simple pilot experiments that are reliable predictors of protein production success, prior to extensive resource investment. The outcome of these pilot experiments dictates which N-terminal tag (His6 or His6-MBP) should be used for large-scale protein production.",

            "text": "To construct a His6- or a His6-MBP fusion expression vector, we amplify the target open reading frame (ORF) by PCR, incorporating into the primers elements that are necessary for Gateway\u00ae cloning and downstream protein production. Next we perform successive BP and LR reactions. The 3\u2032 ends of the primers include a sufficient number of nucleotides that are complementary to the template sequence to result in a 69 \u00b0C melting temperature (by modified Breslauer\u2019s method, see\nhttp://www.thermoscientificbio.com/webtools/tmc/). This enables two-step PCR cycling using 72 \u00b0C as both the annealing and extension temperature. Proximal to the ORF-specific part of the forward primer, we add a sequence that encodes a TEV protease cleavage site preceded by an attB1 site to enable recombination. Because shorter primers are less expensive and because the TEV- and attB1-containing sequences are common to many of our experimental designs, we often use two overlapping forward primers, only one of which is ORF-specific (Fig. 1). An attB2 recombination site is added to the 5\u2032 end of the ORF-specific portion of the reverse PCR primer. During early rounds of cycling, the inner, ORF-specific forward primer (N1) acts with the reverse primer (C) to create a template amplified by N2 and the same reverse primer in later rounds. To favor full-length product accumulation, the concentration of N1 is 20-fold lower than that of N2 and C (see\nNote\n8).The PCR reaction mix is prepared as follows (see\nNote\n9): 10\u201325 ng template DNA, 10 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 Phusion Flash PCR Master Mix (contains all necessary reaction components except primers and template), 0.025 \u03bcM primer N1, 0.5 \u03bcM primer N2, 0.5 \u03bcM primer C, H2O (to 20 \u03bcl total volume).The reaction mixture is placed in a thin-walled tube in a thermal cycler with an appropriate program, such as the following: initial denaturation for 3 min at 98 \u00b0C; 30 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s and 72 \u00b0C for 15 s, and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 60 s (see\nNote\n10); hold at 4 \u00b0C.Purification of the PCR amplicon by agarose gel electrophoresis (see\nNote\n2) is recommended.To create the His6-MBP fusion vector, the PCR product is recombined first into a donor vector, such as pDONR221, to yield an entry clone intermediate (BP reaction), and then into pDEST566 (LR reaction; see\nNote\n11). Similarly, to create the His6-fusion vector, the PCR product is recombined first into a donor vector, such as pDONR221, to yield an entry clone intermediate (BP reaction), and then into pDEST527 (LR reaction) as detailed below.Add to a microcentrifuge tube: 100 ng of the PCR product in 1\u20135 \u03bcl TE or H2O, 1.3 \u03bcl of 150 ng/\u03bcl pDONR vector DNA, and enough TE to bring the total volume to 12 \u03bcl. Mix well.Thaw BP Clonase II enzyme mix on ice (2 min) and then vortex briefly (2 s) twice (see\nNote\n12).Add 3 \u03bcl of BP Clonase II enzyme mix to the components in (a) and vortex briefly; incubate the reaction at room temperature for at least 4 h (see\nNote\n13).Add to 10 \u03bcl of BP reaction: 2 \u03bcl of 150 ng/\u03bcl destination vector (pDEST566 or pDEST527) and 3 \u03bcl of LR Clonase II enzyme mix (see\nNote\n12). Mix by vortexing briefly.Incubate the reaction at room temperature for 2 h.Add 2 \u03bcl of the proteinase K stop solution and incubate for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C.Transform 1 \u03bcl of the reaction into 50 \u03bcl of appropriate competent E. coli, such as electrocompetent DH5\u03b1 cells (see\nNote\n3).Spread the cells on an LB agar plate containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml), the selective marker for pDEST566, pDEST-HisMBP, and pDEST527. Incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C overnight (see\nNote\n14).\nPlasmid DNA is isolated from saturated cultures started from individual ampicillin-resistant colonies and screened by sequencing putative clones to ensure that there are no PCR-introduced mutations.\n",

However, lane 2 reveals that most of the His6-tagged protein is not found in the soluble fraction. In contrast, lanes 3 (total protein) and 4 (soluble protein) clearly demonstrate that a significant portion of the His6-MBP-ChikV protease fusion protein is soluble when produced in the same strain. Lanes 6 (total protein) and 7 (soluble protein) illustrate the solubility of catalytically inactive Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 3C-like protease (MERS-CoV 3CLpro C148A) as a His6-MBP tagged protein. Lanes 8 (total protein) and 9 (soluble protein) reveal that a very similar solubility is obtained even with His6-fusions of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Hence, MERS-CoV 3CLpro is an example of a protein that does not require a solubility enhancer for overproduction in E. coli.\n",

In lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 3, which correspond to the soluble lysate and soluble products of the cleavage reaction, respectively, the band representing the fusion protein has largely disappeared, and three significant new bands have appeared: a 42-kDa band for His6-MBP, 28-kDa band for His-TEV protease, and 37-kDa band migrating at the expected size of ChikV protease. The prominent band corresponding to ChikV protease indicates that it remains soluble after cleavage from MBP , suggesting that it is probably properly folded. Similarly, the cleavage of His6-tagged MERS-CoV 3CLpro was conducted and lanes 3 and 4 indicate the soluble protein and soluble products of TEV digestion, respectively. The cleaved His6-tag and the MERS-CoV 3CLpro (33-kDa) are clearly visible on the gel. Had the TEV protease failed to cleave the fusions or had the target protein become insoluble after cleavage, troubleshooting would have been necessary.

Therefore, although solubility after intracellular processing is generally a useful indicator of a passenger protein\u2019s folding state, it is not absolutely trustworthy. For this reason, we strongly recommend employing a biological assay (if available) at an early stage to confirm that the passenger protein is in its native conformation.

            "text": "\nWe recommend a processive, high-fidelity polymerase such as Phusion (Thermo Fisher or New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) to reduce cycling times and minimize the occurrence of mutations during PCR.We typically purify fragments by horizontal electrophoresis in 1\u20132% Certified Molecular Biology Agarose (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) gels run in sodium borate solution [8] using standard submarine equipment. DNA fragments are extracted from slices of ethidium bromide-stained gel using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.Any gyrA\n+ strain of E. coli can be used. We prefer ElectroMAX\u2122 DH5\u03b1-E\u2122 Competent Cells (Life Technologies) because they are easy to use and very efficient.We prefer the QIAprep\u2122 Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen), but similar kits can be obtained from a wide variety of vendors.Chemically competent cells are transformed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Electrocompetent cells can be purchased or prepared. Briefly, the cells are grown in 1 L of LB medium (with antibiotics, if appropriate) to mid-log phase (OD600 ~ 0.5) and then chilled on ice. The cells are pelleted at 4 \u00b0C, resuspended in 1 L of ice-cold H2O and pelleted again. After several such washes with H2O, the cells are resuspended in 3\u20134 ml of 10% glycerol, divided into 50 \u03bcl aliquots, and immediately frozen in a dry ice\u2013ethanol bath. Competent cells are stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Electrotransformation procedures can be obtained from the electroporator manufacturers (e.g., Bio-Rad, BTX, Eppendorf). Immediately prior to electrotransformation, the cells are thawed on ice and mixed with 10\u2013100 ng of DNA (e.g., a plasmid vector or a Gateway\u00ae reaction). The mixture is placed in an ice-cold electroporation cuvette and electroporated according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (e.g., 1.5 kV pulse in a cuvette with a 1 mm gap). One milliliter of SOC medium [9] is immediately added to the cells and they are allowed to grow at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (ca. 250 rpm) for 1 h. 5\u2013200 \u03bcl of the cells are then spread on an LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic(s).If the open reading frame encoding the passenger protein contains codons that are rarely used in E. coli (http://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/cgi/cam/racc.html), this can adversely affect the yield of a protein. In such cases, it is advisable that the expression strain carries an additional plasmid that codes for rare-codon-tRNA genes. The pRIL plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) is a derivative of the p15A replicon that carries the E. coli argU, ileY, and leuW genes, which encode the cognate tRNAs for AGG/AGA, AUA, and CUA codons, respectively. pRIL is selected for by resistance to chloramphenicol. In addition to the tRNA genes for AGG/AGA, AUA, and CUA codons, the pRARE accessory plasmid in the Rosetta\u2122 host strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) also includes tRNAs for the rarely used CCC and GGA codons. Like pRIL, the pRARE plasmid is a chloramphenicol-resistant derivative of the p15A replicon. Both of these tRNA accessory plasmids are compatible with derivatives of pDEST566, pDEST-HisMBP or pDEST527. Another option is to prepare the insert (cDNA of interest) synthetically, using E. coli-preferred codons.We find it convenient to use precast SDS-PAGE gels, running buffer, molecular weight standards, and electrophoresis supplies from Life Technologies.Alternatively, the PCR reaction can be performed in two separate steps, using primers N1 and C in the first step and primers N2 and C in the second step. The PCR amplicon from the first step is used as the template for the second PCR. All primers are used at the typical concentrations for PCR in the two-step protocol.The PCR reaction can be modified in numerous ways to optimize results, depending on the nature of the template and primers. See Ref. 9 (Vol. 2, Chapter 10.1007/978-1-4939-7000-1_8) for more information.PCR cycle conditions can also be varied based on reagents and consumables chosen, template complexity and gene length. For example, when using Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix, extend the cycle for 15 s per kb of DNA. Consult the directions provided by the manufacturer of your thermostable polymerase.This \u201cone-tube\u201d Gateway \n\u00ae protocol bypasses the isolation of an \u201centry clone\u201d intermediate. However, the entry clone may be useful if you intend to experiment with additional Gateway\u00ae destination vectors, in which case the BP and LR reactions can be performed sequentially in separate steps; detailed instructions are included with the Gateway\u00ae PCR kit. Alternatively, entry clones can easily be regenerated from expression clones via the BP reaction, as described in the manual.Clonase enzyme mixes should be thawed according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.At this point, we remove a 5 \u03bcl aliquot from the reaction and add it to 0.5 \u03bcl of proteinase K stop solution. After 10 min at 37 \u00b0C, we transform 2 \u03bcl into 50 \u03bcl of competent DH5\u03b1 cells (see\nNote\n3) and spread 100\u2013200 \u03bcl on an LB agar plate containing kanamycin (25 \u03bcg/ml), the selective marker for pDONR221. From the number of colonies obtained, it is possible to gauge the success of the BP reaction. Additionally, entry clones can be recovered from these colonies in the event that no transformants are obtained after the subsequent LR reaction.If very few or no transformants are obtained after the BP or LR reactions, the efficiency of the process can be improved by incubating the reactions overnight.We have found that decreasing the induction temperature to 30 \u00b0C increases the quality and solubility of the fusion protein without significantly decreasing the yield, especially in the presence of glucose. We also test 18 \u00b0C inductions if necessary, in which case the inductions are usually longer (18\u201324 h).We routinely disrupt cells in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes on ice with two or three 30 s pulses using a VCX600 sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Inc.) with a microtip at 38% power. The cells are cooled on ice between pulses.\n",
