The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises.",

Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.",

Although the occurrence of a pandemic caused by a new virus is unsurprising for virologists, the infection control measures such as social distancing (Glass et al., 2006) taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 exert tremendous pressure on large parts of a nation's economy. Most actors central to shaping the economy would admit to the current pandemic being a metaphorical black swan event, that is, a surprising, unpredictable event of great significance and severe consequences that dramatically changes the political and economic environment (Winston, 2020) . While such events could be interpreted as opportunities, the unprecedented lockdown of large parts of society arising from the COVID-19 crisis marks the current situation out as an acute crisis. SARS-CoV-2 triggered a twofold crisis: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on many health systems worldwide, and the infection control measures have caused an economic crisis by bringing a vast amount of economic activity to an abrupt halt. Moreover, while many other past crises have hit humanity at a specific point in time and regionally (e.g., hurricanes like Katrina in 2005) or developed over a longer period of time with global effects (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis), the COVID-19 pandemic has developed globally and the necessary countermeasures put in place have hurt economies suddenly.",

Most policy initiatives taken to protect economies during the COVID-19 crisis seem to target established corporations, existing industry sectors, and economies as such, and in doing so those measures aim to protect employment and the continuation of necessary economic activity. Currently, the focus is on protecting the present while the future of economic activity receives less attention. However, innovative startups that will shape that future economic activity are one of the most vulnerable actors in any economy (Walsh & Cunningham, 2016) . Even in calmer times innovative startups face liabilities of newness and smallness (Stinchcombe, 1968 ) that threaten their continued existence. This situation is likely to worsen in times of crisis and the spread of COVID-19 thus threatens to curtail a tremendous potential for innovation that has been accumulated in recent years and was meant to generate economic and potentially societal and ecological value in the near future.",

At the time of writing, measures supported by the German government intended to protect companies and startups affected by the COVID-19 crisis include taxation support, state support for short-hour working, improved measures at guarantee banks, as well as loans and special programs provided by KfW, a state-owned development bank. In addition to these loans (PWC, 2020) , KfW offers other specific support programs for startups, such as growth loans and coinvestment schemes, which were not explicitly developed to address the COVID-19 crisis, but may still prove useful. Moreover, a central measure is the nationwide COVID-19 aid package for large companies, sole-traders, and entrepreneurs. However, many of these measures, such as the KfW loans, are not available to startups as they (especially at an early stage) simply do not meet the traditional criteria for obtaining loans (BVDS, 2020a; PWC, 2020) . Equally, not every startup can rely on investors who apply to co-investment schemes. Many programs require appli-cant firms to be bankable, in that they can be expected to be profitable within a reasonable timeframe. The profit criterion is one an innovative startup cannot usually meet soon after inception. Innovative startups are thus clearly under pressure (German Startups Association 2020a; 2020b).",

            "text": "Beyond the humanitarian tragedy of the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus is also having a growing impact on local economies and the global economy. Fears surrounding the unforeseeable effects of COVID-19 have already significantly influenced the world's top economies and many economists are now forecasting recession (GDA, 2020) . A crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic threatens the functioning and performance of a business (Boin, 2009; Comfort, 2002; Quarantelli, 1988; Williams et al., 2017) . Turbulence affecting a business might arise from disturbed structures, routines, and capabilities (Williams et al. 2017) . Unfortunately, to manage a crisis well, preparation is essential, and few startups would have been prepared for a crisis of the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. The limited number of studies on resilience in the context of entrepreneurship and crises mainly focus on the pre-crisis period and on the skills or resources that entrepreneurs and organizations build up to resist or adapt to crisis events (Bullough et al., 2014; Doern et al., 2019; Korber & McNaughton, 2017) . Generally, the specific characteristics of innovative startups should enable them to be better prepared to cope with the COVID-19 crisis than other types of firms. Being innovative is a precondition of being resilient, as innovative businesses tend to constantly and continuously anticipate and adjust to a broad range of crises (Hamel & Valikangas, 2003; Linneluecke, 2017) . However, businesses do not always recognize the actual threat that a potential crisis event entails (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2019) and the majority of startups will not have been prepared for the events of the last four months. We know from research on the effects of hurricane Katrina and its aftermath that a failure to prepare can have dramatic consequences, particularly for small businesses that are vulnerable to interrupted cash flows, lack of access to capital for recovery, and face problems accessing federal assistance and also serious infrastructure problems (Runyan, 2006) .",

Crisis management is employed to foster resilience and will be of utmost importance during the COVID-19 crisis. Crisis management is employed to minimize the impacts of a crisis (Spillan & Hough, 2003) and, if done well, can quickly restore functionality to organizations suffering from the effects of disrupted or weakened systems (Williams et al., 2017) . The few studies on crisis management in entrepreneurship research predominantly assess the actions that entrepreneurs or organizations take to mitigate the potential negative consequences of a crisis (Doern et al., 2019), among which are changes in sales, marketing, and employment practices. Small businesses in particular tend to excel at adaptability and flexibility (Smallbone et al., 2012) and we should expect them to demonstrate that in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Crisis management in the entrepreneurial context is thus closely related to the concept of bricolage (Mallak, 1998) , and rather than suggesting rigid processes to address the challenges presented by COVID-19, it seems more appropriate for innovative startups to embrace iterative and flexible approaches such as effectual logic (Sarasvathy, 2001) . Findings from research on the 2012 Emilia earthquakes in Italy (Martinelli et al., 2018) illustrate this point: The resilient entrepreneurs were those who created change and opportunities with the resources available at the time, thus clearly following one important effectual principle.",

To face the COVID-19 crisis, startups reported relying heavily on what are termed relational capabilities (Williams et al., 2017) . Accordingly, their response to adversity has first and foremost been based on purposeful bricolage (Williams et al., 2017; Gilbert-Saad et al., 2018) through combining available internal resources and calling upon external resources from their network (Baker & Nelson, 2005) , which would include the goodwill of partners, mutual support in the startup community, and access to social capital through brokers. Moreover, founders reported trying to boost their firms' financial capabilities (Williams et al., 2017) by gathering capital through internal measures and applying for government support. However, with regard to government support, founders reported a perceived mismatch between the support services offered by government policy and their organizations' characteristics, in that, startups are being excluded from policy measures because for example they are not bankable, or the support programs are beset by bureaucratic hurdles that outweigh the benefits. Consequently, the startups' first response to the crisis was not founded on obtaining immediate governmental support. Finally, founders reported that they are very cognizant of their customers' shifting needs due to the COVID-19 crisis. Given the above conditions, startups applied their bricolage crisis response to solve new problems, in that they identified and pursued new entrepreneurial opportunities and established new directions for their firms.",

            "text": "While crisis management on the micro level is largely the task of entrepreneurs themselves, policymakers are called upon to support entrepreneurs in their endeavors to deal with crises such as COVID-19, meaning that policymakers conduct crisis management on the macro level as they aim to strengthen the resilience of businesses, including startups, and to support their individual crisis management actions. Interestingly, research has shown that regions that exhibit a high level of entrepreneurship pre-crisis are well positioned to deal with exogenous shocks (Williams & Vorley, 2015; Bishop, 2019 ). An entrepreneurial region is characterized by the resilience of its enterprises and entrepreneurial activity can contribute to restructuring and adaptation in the aftermath of the crisis. Fieldwork by Grube and Storr (2018) conducted following hurricane Katri-na and the tornadoes in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Joplin, Missouri, illustrates how post-disaster entrepreneurs contribute to recovery through actions such as supplying necessary resources to disaster victims while leveraging social capital to navigate extreme uncertainty. Such people are motivated by high place attachment, and address both commercial and societal goals. It is very likely that in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis we will see regions coping differently with the consequences of drastic lockdown measures, and some will benefit from their entrepreneurial potential. Whether this becomes possible depends on how innovative entrepreneurs can be. From a policymakers' perspective, it would however be unwise to rely solely on entrepreneurial initiative to fix the economic damage triggered by lockdown measures; instead, it should be a key priority of policymakers in the short-term during the COVID-19 crisis to guarantee that innovative startups can call on sufficient resources. New legislation, however, might not be the method of choice. Drawing on in-depth interviews with Greek entrepreneurs, Williams and Vorley (2015) suggest that changes to institutions have constrained entrepreneurial activity rather than enhanced it, and that effect was more pronounced in the midst of crisis. In any case, external assistance for affected regions prior to, during, and in the aftermath (e.g. McEntire & Myers, 2004 ) of the COVID-19 lockdown will be essential.",

The international media reports in English we identified cover policy measures being called for or implemented to support SMEs and startups in 40 countries. Among them are countries such as Namibia or Nepal, which at the point of data collection reported fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19. We differentiate between those measures called for by stakeholders such as entrepreneurs, scholars, or lobbyists (40.98% of all coded measures) and policy measures announced by government or central banks (59.02%). Interestingly, the latter outweigh the former, which suggests most governments reacted promptly and in a resolute manner to the COVID-19 crisis. We find a plethora of immediate responses to the COVID-19 crisis specifically to support SMEs addressing the current threats around decreasing revenues, mounting costs, and illiquidity. Figure 3 provides an overview of the number of countries announcing the various measures to protect SMEs and startups. Overall, most measures represent short-term aid; the most popular policy measure announced or implemented by governments worldwide is to enhance a firm's financial capital by reducing loan interest rates or improving loan availability.",

An example is the Chinese call to generally secure the accessibility of financial capital for innovative startups. Among the measures being called for, some US opinion leaders advocate not losing sight of sustainable development goals and thus suggest economic government aid be tied to adherence to measures to ameliorate climate change (Kaufmann, 2020). If governments succeed in providing immediate relief to entrepreneurs under pressure, in a way that remains in line with the long-term objectives of \"promoting health, equity, and environmental protection\" (Wyns, 2020) , the COVID-19 crisis may even contribute to a better future. Across all countries, we observe that the policy measures discussed or announced are usually available to businesses in general (82.93% of the countries). In 63.41% of the countries we find measures designed to specifically meet the re-quirements of SMEs.

We have illustrated how the economic crisis caused by infection control measures-and in particular the lockdown of much economic activity-affects innovative startups and the measures that could be taken to protect them. Unlike, for instance, the crisis caused by the dotcom boom and bust (Ofek & Richardson, 2003) , the COVID-19 crisis threatens potential for innovation that could have proven viable in normal times. With respect to the fall of internet stock prices at the turn of the millennium, it could be argued that this was a shake-out during which unviable business models were eliminated. The COVID-19 crisis seems different; and the situation is not only about state intervention and protection of innovative startups. In particular the qualitative part of this rapid response research suggests that some businesspeople in the entrepreneurial ecosystem already perceive entrepreneurial opportunity in a positive sense, that is, they see an opportunity to address current issues by employing entrepreneurial measures. We identified seven factors related to adversity and coping strategies, which, however, only constitutes a first step to understanding startups' reactions to crises in general and to the COVID-19 crisis in particular. Future research will have to identify just how those factors interact, and it will be particularly interesting to determine how adverse situations can be managed to produce positive consequences. Our key dynamics model (Figure 3) suggests entrepreneurs re-sponding to the COVID-19 crisis are employing a bricolage approach as part of their initial response to turn crisis induced adversity into resilience.",

            "text": "The quality of an organization's response to a crisis is typically associated with resilience and \"depends on the capacity to enhance improvisation, coordination, flexibility, and endurance \u2026\" (Boin et al., 2010, p. 11) . These are qualities that are closer to routine behavior among innovative startups than they are among larger more-established firms. Furthermore, smaller businesses are often more creative than large firms, and this creativity might help to ensure that those businesses remain viable in the face of adversity (Williams et al., 2017) . Many entrepreneurs adopt the bricoleur role as they attempt to spur change and create opportunities with the resources available (Martinelli et al., 2018) . Bricoleurs demonstrate that crises can nurture the development of new opportunities (Br\u00fcnjes & Revilla-Diez, 2013), innovation, and alternative products/services (Brem et al., 2020; Irvine & Anderson, 2004) . As crises can also encourage the exploitation of new opportunities (Br\u00fcnjes & Revilla-Diez, 2013), they can prompt innovation and the development of alternative products and services (Brem et al., 2020; Irvine & Anderson, 2004) . In the short-term, there will be opportunities arising from the COVID-19 crisis, particularly for lifescience ventures. The long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are, however, not yet foreseeable, but it seems inevitable that broader opportunities will arise. The literature suggests that for entrepreneurs, dealing with uncertainty and failure is a normal part of business (Ucbasaran et al., 2013; Mandl et al., 2016) , even when the uncertainty is caused by a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, entrepreneurs can be expected to demonstrate flexibility and adapt their business models in response to a crisis. This would suggest startups are better prepared for crises than any other economic actor. Some commentators will no doubt suggest that startups' flexibility and the relatively low numbers they employ mean that excluding them from governmental aid programs will not have a critical impact on the economy, but letting startups go to the wall potentially jeopardizes a state's future innovativeness. Therefore, mid-, or long-term policy measures targeting future innovativeness, while unlikely to be the first responses to such a crisis, nonetheless seem essential. This finding is in line with prior research suggesting entrepreneurial responsiveness to crises is determined by factors such as entrepreneurial culture and knowledge diversity (Bishop 2019; Bishop and Shilcof 2017) , which cannot be addressed by short-term measures, but are the result of consistent policies fostering entrepreneurship. Just as the resilience of different state's health systems (Wyns, 2020) is currently proving central to their ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries that have established resilient entrepreneurial ecosystems will be able to resume their pre-crisis level of activity more quickly than those that have not. The interviews conducted in support of this research show that startups will rely heavily on the support of their entrepreneurial ecosystem to manage the crisis. Policy measures are thus only likely to be successful if they are complemented by the wider attributes of an entrepreneurial ecosystem (Spigel, 2017) . Incentivizing investors to provide growth capital despite the crisis-as called for by venture capitalists in Great Britain (M2 PressWIRE, 2020)could be a suitable way to combine both providing short-term liquidity to pay wages and bills while laying the foundations for future recovery.",

While it remains unclear what specific measures will be most effective, it seems evident that programs specifically targeting innovative startups should be mandatory. Assuming measures targeting SMEs will benefit innovative startups too would be an error policymakers must avoid. Unlike many other crises, the COVID-19 crisis has not hit every country at the same time. At least in healthcare, many European countries were able to learn from the experiences of China and Italy and to react proactively. While the time-lag of the economic crisis hitting countries might disappear in the long run, policy makers can nevertheless observe how measures taken to protect startups are unfolding and adopt or discard them as appropriate to improve the knowledge derived from crisis situations (Boin, 2009) . Future research should thus not only evaluate the effectiveness of the different policy measures on the entrepreneurial activity in various countries but could also aim to understand the effect of short response times to economic crises. It will be important to follow up on the effects of the measures taken during the COVID-19 crisis to prepare for future comparable events. ",

Following Glaser and Strauss (1967) , a large number of categories were identified, although the first research question guided our focus in the coding process. The coding team especially looked out for signs of adversity facing the firms of the interviewees and tried to elicit the responses actioned. In order to give respondents a voice and to their perceptions as closely as possible, we used in vivo coding when possible (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007; Gioia et al., 2013; Salda\u00f1a, 2015) . Following the process of Shepherd et al. (2019) , one author of the coding team used three interviews with entrepreneurs to identify key issues on the research question and built a first version of codes by aggregating similarities. Two authors then used the code list to code unprocessed interviews. In a subsequent iterative approach, constantly comparing data, codes, and categories (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007) , the coding team discussed and agreed upon a list of first-order codes (Locke, 2001) . Based on the evolving understanding of our codes and theory we also adjusted the semi-structured questionnaire (Strauss & Corbin, 1994) . One of the authors created a first version of aggregated codes and first-order categories leading to secondorder themes. Two other authors assessed the categories and themes and generated an adjusted list of second-order themes based on the consensus within the coding team (Appendix 3). The second-order themes were then directed toward overarching dimensions relating to existing theory (Gioia et al., 2013; Strauss & Corbin, 1994) . We terminated data collection once we achieved theoretical saturation (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) . The data structure model (Figure 1) illustrates the data development from interviews to codes, themes, and dimensions whereas the key dynamics model (Figure 3 ) provides indications for theoretical implications stemming from the data structure (in line with Shepherd et al., 2019; Nag et al., 2007) .",
