The aim of this study was to determine the viral etiology of respiratory infections in hospitalized children, to understand the viral seasonality in a major Lebanese hospital, and to correlate disease severity and the presence of virus. Over a 1-year period, nasal and throat swabs were collected from 236 pediatric patients, aged 16year old or less and hospitalized for acute respiratory illness. Samples collected were tested for the presence of 17 respiratory viruses using multiplex real-time RT-PCR. Pathogens were identified in 165 children (70%) and were frequently observed during fall and winter seasons. Co-infection was found in 37% of positive samples. The most frequently detected pathogens were human Rhinovirus (hRV, 23%), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV, 19%), human Bocavirus (hBov, 15%), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV, 10%), and human Adenovirus (hAdV, 10%). A total of 48% of children were diagnosed with bronchiolitis and 25% with pneumonia. While bronchiolitis was often caused by RSV single virus infection and hAdV/hBoV coinfection, pneumonia was significantly associated with hBoV and HP1V1 infections. No significant correlation was observed between a single viral etiology infection and a specific clinical symptom. This study provides relevant facts on the circulatory pattern of respiratory viruses in Lebanon and the importance of using PCR as a useful tool for virus detection. Early diagnosis at the initial time of hospitalization may reduce the spread of the viruses in pediatric units.",

Most of these infections are confined to the upper respiratory tract (URT) leading to symptoms of common cold, coryza, and cough and are often accompanied by fever with fatigue and loss of appetite in some cases. Approximately, one third of infants with respiratory viral infections develop lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms that may lead to bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and severe respiratory distress [Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010] .",

It was previously documented that viruses may be persistent in asymptomatic individuals who may be also shedding in the nasal secretion for 11 days, 3 weeks and 6 months in hRV, RSV, and hBoV infections, respectively [van Benten et al., 2003; von Linstow et al., 2008; Blessing et al., 2009; Peltola et al., 2013; Piedimonte and Perez, 2014] . The high rate of co-infections led us to explore the association between the presence of multiple viruses and severity of symptoms. According to our results and in accordance with previous studies, we found no differences in clinical severity between patients hospitalized with single infection and those with viral co-infection [Aberle et al., 2005; Paranhos-Baccala et al., 2008; Asner et al., 2014] . However, a previous study conducted by Semple et al. [2005] demonstrated that coinfection with both hMPV and RSV increase by 10-fold the risk of admission for intensive care unit and the use for mechanical ventilation. This hypothesis could not be applied in our study since only one child was infected with both viruses and was not admitted to ICU for ventilation.",

In our study, we used nasal and throat swabs instead of nasopharyngeal swab, which is a more invasive procedure with a higher sensitivity [Do et al., 2011] .
