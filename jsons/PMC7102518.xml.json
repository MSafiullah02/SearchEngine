            "text": "Influenza virus affects approximately 10% of the population during every season. In most healthy individuals, these infections predominantly result in relatively mild, self-limiting disease that remains restricted to the upper respiratory tract and does not require therapeutic intervention. Reflecting the overall high disease prevalence, however, the World Health Organization estimates that 3\u20135 million infections lead to severe disease that advances to the lower respiratory tract and viral pneumonia, resulting in up to 650,000 deaths annually.1 High-risk groups for severe influenza infection include older adults, the immunocompromized, pregnant women, people with underlying pulmonary conditions, and, to a lesser degree, the very young. Yearly vaccination is recommended for everyone older than 6 months of age, but vaccine efficacy varies substantially based on how well circulating viruses and vaccine strains are matched, patient age and patient influenza history. In the 2017/18 influenza season, for instance, vaccine efficacy against the predominant H3N2 strain was only 25%, leading to the highest mortality rate since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.2 Although disease burden was particularly high in that season, vaccination efficacy was on average below 50% also in the preceding years also.3\n,\n4 Moreover, effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is particularly low in older adults, leaving one of the primary at-risk groups poorly protected (reviewed in5). Due to these limitations to vaccine prophylaxis combined with continued high disease burden caused by seasonal influenza viruses, the threat of spill-over of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses into the human population and a low barrier to viral escape of standard-of-care therapeutics (discussed in detail below), effective novel antiviral therapeutics are urgently needed for improved disease management especially in high risk patients and for heightened preparedness against the risk of future global pandemics.",

            "text": "Whereas influenza virus infection causes direct cell damage in the airway epithelium, severe tissue damage during complicated disease is largely a consequence of immunopathogenesis and peaks after the acute infection has been cleared. Influenza virus load in the upper respiratory tract is highest approximately 2\u20133 days after infection, which coincides with peak fever and most pronounced respiratory clinical signs. After the third day of infection, virus replication is increasingly immune controlled and virus load drops rapidly.6 Rapid disease progression and, in the case of uncomplicated disease, immune control of virus replication outline a narrow therapeutic window for influenza drugs. Ideally, treatment should be initiated within 24\u201336 hours of infection. In fact, clinical studies assessing the impact of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) have revealed a benefit for the patient when treatment was initiated within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms,7\n,\n8 and therapeutic impact was greatest when antiviral drugs were administered within 24 hours of disease manifestation.9, 10, 11 Accordingly, public disease awareness, proactive patient behavior, and access to rapid diagnostics are paramount for therapeutic success. Several diagnostic methods are currently used in the clinic that shorten the time to treatment, recently comparatively reviewed in.12\n",

Since both IAVs and IBVs are human pathogens and clinically relevant,64 efficacy against pathogens of both genera should constitute a developmental objective of next-generation drugs. This target breadths cannot be achieved with traditional bnAbs. However, engineering of multidomain antibodies has been explored experimentally and proof-of-concept efficacy against both IAVs and IBVs has been demonstrated in mice,65 potentially illuminating a path to overcome this limitation. Furthermore, better compliance from the large patient group of nonhospitalized adults suffering from uncomplicated disease is expected when the drug is orally bioavailable and amenable to cost-effective manufacture. bnAbs appear therefore best suited for use in high risk groups or hospitalized patients with complicated disease.",

Influenza virus RdRP is comprised of 3 subunits, the PB1, PB2, and PA proteins, that are responsible for both replication and transcription of the 8 genome segments. The segments do not exist as naked RNA but are encapsidated by viral NP proteins, forming RNP complexes. Whereas replication requires the generation of complementary positive polarity RNA intermediates (cRNA) that are then copied into progeny negative polarity segments (vRNPs), viral message is directly synthesized from vRNPs. Since the influenza virus RdRP lacks enzymatic activity to form 5\u2032 mRNA cap structures, endonuclease activity of the PA subunit is instrumental for the generation of bioactive viral mRNAs through transfer of 5\u2032-capped RNA primers derived from host mRNAs in a cap-snatching mechanism. PB2 is involved in binding of the capped primers, whereas the PB1 subunit harbors enzymatic activity for phosphodiester bond formation.66, 67, 68, 69 The overall replication strategy and RdRP organization is highly conserved across all IAV subtypes and among IAVs and IBVs, increasing the likelihood that therapeutic targeting of the polymerase complex will result in the development of broad-spectrum influenza virus inhibitors.",

A single dose is typically sufficient for clinical benefit, and efficacy is similar to, or better than, current standard-of-care.71\n,\n72 In clinical trials, participants showed significantly lower viral burden 1 day after initiation of treatment compared to placebo groups, and the time to alleviation of clinical signs was decreased on average by approximately 26 hours, which resembled the improvements that can be achieved with NAIs.72 Quite remarkably, twice daily experimental treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of a highly pathogenic avian IAV resulted in complete survival of the animals and reduction of viral load in the respiratory tract. Similarly profound efficacy was observed in immunocompromized mice.73, 74, 75 In addition to activity against IAVs, IBVs and influenza viruses of the C and D genera are susceptible to baloxavir inhibition, making the drug a truly broad-spectrum influenza virus inhibitor.71\n,\n76\n,\n77\n",

Resembling resistance profiles generated for different PA endonuclease inhibitor chemotypes in cell culture,81 the signature hotspot for escape from baloxavir marboxil is PA residue 38, for which several substitutions (PA I38T/M/F) have been described. The initial characterization of PA I38 mutant viruses in cell culture suggested that resistance may carry a severe fitness penalty.71\n,\n82 However, subsequent follow-up analyses of the fitness of H1N1 and H3N2 strains containing PA I38 mutants in the ferret model revealed that pathogenesis and transmission success of resistant and the corresponding sensitive viruses were equivalent.83\n,\n84 In mice and ferrets, both loss of animal body weight and lung viral loads were identical after infection with resistant or sensitive viruses, and substitutions at PA I38 remained stable over 4 passages through mice.85\n,\n86 A small percentage of influenza viruses circulating in the United States in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons, and thus prior to approval of baloxavir marboxil, contained mutations at PA residue 38.80\n,\n87\n,\n88 Moreover, a resistant H3N2 virus was detected in a pediatric patient without prior exposure to baloxavir marboxil, supporting that this mutant strain spread between humans.89 Even though baloxavir marboxil has not yet been used extensively in the clinic and long-term field data are scarce, the available evidence indicates that the genetic barrier against resistance to the drug is low and that escape comes with little penalty to viral fitness, pathogenesis, or transmission success. Accordingly, there is considerable risk that pre-exiting resistance to baloxavir marboxil could become widespread with increasing duration of clinical use.",

In the past year, the first new drug class in over 2 decades was approved for influenza therapy, providing a much-needed expansion of the available antiviral arsenal. However, low genetic barriers of both neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors against viral escape create an urgent need for next-generation therapeutics. Of the different developmental candidates currently explored, bnAbs are attractive for the protection of high-risk groups if treatment costs can be managed. Competitive ribonucleoside analog inhibitors with high resistance barrier are promising for use against seasonal and pandemic viruses, provided the risk of adverse effects is acceptably low or can be appropriately mitigated.",

Sublethal concentrations of the inhibitor increase the frequency of random transition mutations, reducing overall fitness of the virus population (salmon). At sterilizing concentrations, the drug increases the random mutation frequency beyond a tolerable threshold, resulting in collapse of the virus population (red); MOA, mechanism of action.
