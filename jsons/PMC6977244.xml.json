            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a potential pathogen of zoonotic disease and causes worldwide important economic losses [8, 9]. Pathogenesis studies have shown that in pigs as well as in all other mammals viral infection and replication is limited to the respiratory tract [10]. Independent of the subtype, the disease can emerge both in a subclinical and in an acute way, with varying severity, showing febrile illness together with respiratory disease [4, 8, 11]. An involvement in reproductive disorders, such as return to oestrus, abortion or small litters, is assumed, although a causal link could not be shown in all studies [12, 13]. Numerous case reports as well as a case-control study on a naive Norwegian pig subpopulation describe the emergence of reproductive disorders in context with the infection with influenza A virus [14\u201317]. In contrast, there are few experimental studies investigating the pathogenesis and the clinical presentation of the reproductive losses [18\u201320]. The clinical presentation was not reproducible in these studies. Thus, a validation of a causal link between the virus infection and inadequate reproductive performance is still lacking. Subsequent to the emergence of the pandemic influenza A virus, a new vaccine against this subtype was developed. The results of the clinical studies for efficacy and safety were verified under field conditions in 315 farms infected with pandemic influenza A virus. A majority of the sows in the affected farms where IAV was circulating showed remarkably reduced reproductive performance. The present longitudinal field study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pandemic IAV on the reproductive parameters and vaccination of animals in conventional sow herds.",

The results of the survey concerning the clinical signs of the infection with pandemic IAV coincide with the observations of numerous experimental studies and case reports [4, 11, 21]. Interestingly, in the present study, reproductive disorders were present in nearly 80% of the assessed farms. A connection between reduced reproductive performance and infection with IAV is described in the literature, but data confirming a causal link is lacking. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of reproductive disorders subsequent to infection with IAV is not definitively determined. Alterations of the maternal immune system during pregnancy can result in an increased likelihood of influenza virus infection [22]. The few studies examining the effect of infection with IAV during pregnancy were conducted mainly with rodent models [22, 23]. Thus, interpretation of these studies is hampered by histological dissimilarities of the rodent placenta and the of swine placenta [24]. It is assumed that reproductive disorders due to influenza virus infections are indirectly caused by systemic consequences of the infection [25], particularly by fever and immunological reactions leading to hormonal imbalances [26, 27]. An increase in proinflammatory gene expression after infection with influenza virus results in the release of inflammatory cytokines [28, 29]. The pathological consequence of the infection may be reduced progesterone synthesis in the corpus luteum in pregnant animals [23]. Consequently, a low progesterone level induces luteolysis and termination of pregnancy [30].",

It was shown previously that by immunisation with the vaccine used in the current study, the viral lung load, virus shedding and clinical parameters such as dyspnoea and elevated body temperature can be reduced in animals infected with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus [33, 34]. Reduction in viral lung load and viral shedding after immunisation correlates with reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion and therefore with the extent of the disease [35].",

Usually, there are also only a few litters involved [15, 18]; thus, the cases where this pathogenesis could have been seen in the current study are probably overlaid by the usual losses.

With the exception of three farms, improvement of at least one reproductive parameter was observed after vaccination. However, the alteration of each parameter differed between farms. These individual levels of influenza affectedness of the single parameter can be explained by various assumptions. There may be different IAV infection time points affecting not all sows in all different gestational states, resulting in different clinical outcomes apparent in the reproductive parameters. Perhaps in the three farms with no improvement in reproductive performance after vaccination IAV infection either remained subclinical or manifested in respiratory disease rather than in reproductive disorders. Furthermore, as it is described that the infection dynamic of IAV can vary from endemic to short epidemic patterns [42], it could be assumed that the assessed time periods did not include the time of clinical disease in the mentioned farms. Additionally, the presence of stress or other immunosuppressive agents might have adversely affected the onset of immunity. After all, vaccine management and handling procedures were not monitored, so lack of compliance might be a possible cause as well. The analysis of the effect of pre-vaccination of some herds against other influenza subtypes revealed that the number of piglets weaned per sow and year improved significantly (p = 0.016) more in herds pre-vaccinating sows than in herds that only vaccinated against the pandemic IAV. Repeated vaccination of pigs with antigens of different IAV strains can induce slight cross-reactions in neutralisation tests with pandemic influenza viruses [43]; however, cross-protective immunity cannot be achieved [44]. The parameter piglets weaned per sow and year is only indirectly affected by the vaccine through improved colostrum quality and quantity transferred from healthier sows and a reduction in virus shedding in the farrowing unit. Thus, the results of the current study may indicate improved conditions for piglet health in the farrowing unit when sows are pre-vaccinated against other influenza strains.",

To verify the causality of the present findings experimental studies need to be conducted under controlled conditions, which was beyond the scope of the current study. However, given that until now, it was not possible to experimentally reproduce the pathogenesis of reproductive disorders due to influenza A virus infection [19, 20], the present results support the common assumption of an association. The findings of the current field study are substantiated through the combination of the large number of cases and the different assessed parameters predominantly showing the same results.",

Subsequently, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test or a paired t-test was performed on the paired samples, depending on wether the metric variables were normally distributed. To test whether the numbers of herds with increasing or decreasing reproductive parameters differed, a one-sample chi-square test was performed. For analysis of variance (ANOVA), R software version 3.3.12016 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) was used. To test the association between herd size and reproductive performance or vaccination against other IAV subtypes and reproductive performance, a linear regression model was employed. Each farm was considered a statistical unit. The applied level of significance was 5% (p < 0.05).",
