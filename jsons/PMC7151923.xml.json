The number of treatment spaces needed in an ED is usually matched to the anticipated ED patient volume; roughly 1 treatment space per 1100 annual ED visits or 1 treatment space per 400 annual ED hospital admissions is recommended.1 According to disaster planners, a major urban trauma center ED built for 50,000 to 100,000 visits per year should have surge capacity up to 100 patients per hour for 4 hours and 1000 patients per day for 4 days. One disaster-ready design challenge is to provide surge capacity to meet anticipated patient needs. Hospitals are woefully overcrowded, and EDs are routinely housing admitted patients.9, 10, 11 To maintain surge capacity, efforts to address hospital overcrowding and eliminate the boarding of admissions in the ED must be successful.",

Garage and parking lot space has been used in many disaster drills and mass exposures. Garages and parking lots can be designed with separate access to streets, allowing separation of disaster traffic and routine ED traffic. More often, needed terror-response supplies (e.g., antidotes, respirators, personal protective gear) are stored near or within the ED. The cost of ventilation, heat, air conditioning, communication, and security features often prohibits renovation of garages. More often, tents are erected over parking lots or loading areas. Modular \u201csecond EDs,\u201d tents or structures with collapsible walls (fold and stack), have been deployed by disaster responders. These can be used near the main ED, preserving the ED for critical cases during a disaster surge. Some hospitals are building capacity for beds in halls and double capacity patient rooms, and converting other nontreatment spaces to wards to increase their ability to meet patient surges during disaster. Hallways can provide usable space if constructed wider and equipped with medical gases and adequate power and lighting. Often only minimal modifications are necessary to make existing halls and lobbies dual-use spaces. Some hospitals have increased space by installing retractable awnings on the exterior over ambulance bays or loading docks. Tents are often used outside EDs as decontamination and treatment areas in disaster drills. Tents with inflatable air walls have the added benefit of being insulated for all-weather use.",

U.S. Air Force air evacuation flights have stacked critical patients three high, and some naval vessels may bunk patients vertically in mass-casualty scenarios. Similar bed units could be deployed for a mass event. Portable modular units are also available to help EDs meet additional space needs. Unfortunately, many EDs plan to rely on other facilities in the regional system and do not build in surge capacity. During a terror event occurring on a hospital campus, the ED function may need to be moved to a remote area within the hospital in response to a flood, fire, building collapse, bomb or bomb threat, active shooter, or other event. Many disaster plans designate a preexisting structure on campus as the \u201cbackup\u201d ED. The area is stockpiled with equipment and has a viable plan for access.

Stairways are sufficient in size to allow backboarded and chair-bound patients to be evacuated. Ground level EDs should have access to surface streets, interior pathways, and exterior sidewalks.

Some computer-based tracking systems have a disaster mode that quickly adapts to a large influx of patients allowing for collation of symptoms, laboratory values, and other pertinent syndromic data. In many regions, EDs provide real-time data that serve as a disaster alert surveillance network. Routine data obtained on entry are passively collected and transferred to a central point for analysis (usually a health department). In the event of a significant spike in targeted patient symptom complexes, these data can trigger an appropriate disaster response. The capacity for this entry point surveillance should be anticipated and built in to any disaster-ready ED information system.24, 25, 26 For example, data terminals allowing patients to input data at registration similar to electronic ticketing at airports could passively provide information during a surge, rather than requiring chief complaint and registration data input by staff. This self-service system could add to ED surge capacity. Similarly, real-time bed identification, availability, and reservation systems used to assist patient management in some EDs could aid ED function during disaster. Movement to an inpatient bed is a well-documented choke point recognized nationally during normal hospital operations, and implementing a plan to open access to admissions becomes an issue during disaster.",

EDs have added or augmented DECON facilities. DECON areas should have a separate, self-contained drainage system, controlled water temperature, and shielding from environmental hazards. Exhaust fans are used to prevent the buildup of toxic off-gassing in these decontamination areas. Most importantly, DECON facilities should be deployable within minutes of an incident, to avoid secondary contamination of the ED. For most EDs, mass DECON has been accomplished by using an uncovered parking lot and deploying heated and vented modular tent units. Uncovered parking areas adjacent and accessible to the ED have been enabled for disaster response. Other EDs use high-volume, low-pressure showers mounted on the side of a building. Serial showers allow multiple patients to enter at the same entrance and time. However, serial showers do not provide privacy, can be difficult for an ill patient to access, and can lead to contaminated water runoff. Also, persons requiring more time may impede flow and reduce the number of patients decontaminated. Parallel showers built in advance or set up temporarily in tenting offer greater privacy but require wider space and depth. Combined serial and parallel design allows the advantages of each, separating ill patients and increasing the number of simultaneous decontaminations.29\n",

Patients who present with undetermined respiratory illnesses are routinely sent to an isolation area. A direct entrance from the exterior to an isolation room is not usually available but has been a recent renovation in some EDs. Creation of isolation areas poses special design requirements for HVAC, cleaning, and security to ensure that infections and infected persons are contained. An isolation area should have compartmentalized air handling with high-efficiency filters providing clean air.35, 36, 37, 38 Biohazard contamination is particularly difficult to mitigate. Keeping the facility \u201cclean\u201d and safe for other patients is an extreme challenge. Biologic agents of terrorism or epidemics may resist decontamination attempts. Infected patients present a risk to staff. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, Singapore built outdoor tent hospitals to supplement their existing decontamination facility. Patients were evaluated outside the ED and those with fever were isolated and not allowed to enter the main hospital. This, among other measures, allowed Singapore to achieve relatively rapid control over the epidemic.39 Few triage areas and ED rooms have been designed for decontamination. Surfaces must be able to withstand repeated decontamination. Sealed inlets for gases and plumbing have also been considered.40 Patients who are isolated can be observed with monitoring cameras. Some isolation areas include a restroom within their space, which helps restrict patient egress.",

A compartmentalized central venting system without recirculation has the ability to remove or contain toxic agents in and around the ED. Compartmentalized HVAC systems allow for the sealing of zones from each other. More desirable HVAC systems electronically shut down sections, use effective filtration, and can clean contaminated air. A compartmentalized system can fail, but it only fails in the zone it is servicing; smaller zones mean smaller areas lost to contamination. These systems are less vulnerable to global failure or spread of contamination. Modular mobile HVAC units developed for field military applications have been added to existing ED isolation areas for use when needed to create safe air compartments.",

Certainly the surge capacity of a disaster-ready ED could be used for natural disaster response and in disaster drills. The surge space could also be used for over-census times, public health events, immunizations, and health screenings. Newly built or renovated EDs should have excess capacity by design to serve as a community disaster resource.
