Colloque Internationale sur les Glycoconjugu\u00e9s\u201d (later named the 2nd International Symposium on Glycoconjugates), organized by Jean Montreuil in 1973 at the Universit\u00e9 des Sciences et Technologies de Lille (Villeneuve d\u2019Ascq, France), stated: \u201cWe are not at the end of all progress, but at the beginning; we have but reached the shores of a great unexplored continent.\u201d1 And this certainly held for his favorite topic: sialic acid research. Gottschalk encouraged students interested in research to work in the field of carbohydrate (bio)chemistry/glycobiology, which rapidly expanded in the 1970s. Since then, as this review will show, many questions regarding the chemistry, analysis, biochemistry, and biology of sialic acids could be answered, and the important influences of this family of sugar molecules on and in our lives have been documented in a myriad of publications.",

            "text": "Sialic acids are frequently found in Nature in many molecular forms, and detailed reviews have been available since the 1960s.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 These compounds are regularly present in higher animals like Echinoderma, Hemichorda, Cephalocorda, and Vertebrata and could also sporadically be identified in some members of other groups of animals, such as the Platyhelminthes (Polychoerus carmelensis), Cephalopoda, and Crustaceae (Homarus americanus). It is, however, not clear whether the sialic acids are produced by the animals themselves or originate from nutrition or microorganisms. Sialic acid concentrations have been measured in subcellular membrane fractions of various cell types, showing highest values in the plasma membrane (65%\u201370% of the total sialic acid quantity of the cell) and in much lower amounts in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.3 Generally, most of these sugars are bound to glycoproteins with the exception of nerve and brain cells, where they prevail on glycolipids. The overall sialic acid level in the various organelles was assumed to be influenced by endogenous sialidase, but no experimental evidence existed. Interestingly, also insects were shown to contain sialic acids and to express corresponding enzymes.8, 9, 10, 11 Sialic acids were found in some viruses, various bacteria, protozoa, and pathogenic fungi. They are absent in plants and in most animals in the evolutionary tree lower than the echinoderms. The various studies show that sialic acids appeared relatively late in evolution, which led to the assumption that acquisition of these monosaccharides accelerated differentiation of the higher animals.2, 4 Deaminated neuraminic acid is often seen in vertebrates and bacteria, but its abundant occurrence in animals is limited to the lower vertebrates.12 Further details are included in the various sections in this chapter, when applicable.",

            "text": "In naturally occurring sialic acid-containing structures, the sialic acid units play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes via carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions, including cellular recognition and communication, cellular aggregation and development, controlling the lifetimes of glycoconjugates in organisms, mediating bacterial and viral infections, being involved in tumor growth and metastasis, playing a great role in immunology, in the biology of the microbiome, in cell signaling, in reproduction biology, and in neurobiology. Sialic acids, which occur mostly as the terminal part of many glycoconjugates (glycoproteins; glycolipids) and carbohydrate chains (oligosaccharides, capsular and tissue polysialic acids, bacterial lipooligo/polysaccharides) occur in various chemical forms, which can dramatically influence their biology. O-Acetyl and N-glycolyl groups, in particular, are most effective in determining sialic acid function. Many genes and enzymes control the anabolism and catabolism of sialic acids, which are of importance not only in health but also in disease situations. Increasing information about the regulation of sialic acid expression on the genetic level of various hereditary diseases can be gathered. Sialopharmacy is still in its infancy, but recently more publications show progress in this field. But it was not too long ago that groups of scientists worldwide were trying to elucidate the primary structures and the basic biochemical reactions of these unusual monosaccharides.",

            "text": "Nowadays, the basic structural features of the sialic acid (Sia) family, a subclass of the superfamily of naturally occurring non-2-ulosonic acids (NulOs), are well known (Fig. 1\n). The mother molecule of the family, neuraminic acid (Neu), which does not occur in free form in nature due to its immediate cyclization to form an internal Schiff base, is a nine-carbon-containing monosaccharide, chemically defined as a combination of a 2-keto-carboxylic acid, a deoxysugar, and an aminosugar. It is systematically named 5-amino-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (Neu; C9H17NO8) (C7 is the anomeric reference atom). The intramolecular (cyclic) hemiketal form of Neu (C2\u2013O\u2013C6) comprises a pyranose ring in a 2\nC\n5 chair conformation with an equatorially oriented glycerol side chain at C6. The amino group at C5 is generally N-acetylated [5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid (IUPAC/IUBMB Recommendations 1996/199713); N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac; C11H19NO9] (for different views, see Fig. 2\n) or N-glycolylated [5-hydroxyacetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid (IUPAC/IUBMB Recommendations 1996/199713); N-glycolylneuraminic acid, Neu5Gc; C11H19NO10]. Note that the full name for Neu5Ac, as presented in the IUPAC/IUB document 1969/1971,14 namely, 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonic acid, is no longer used. The amino group at C5 can also be replaced by a hydroxyl function, yielding 3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid (ketodeoxynononic acid, Kdn; C9H16O9) (IUPAC/IUBMB Recommendations 1996/199713), usually called deaminated neuraminic acid (other names used: 2-keto-3-deoxy-nononic acid, 3-deoxynon-2-ulosonic acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nononic acid). To indicate the absolute configuration, up to the 1980s the trivial names of the mother molecule and the derived members were presented with the configurational prefix d, e.g., d-neuraminic acid, N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid, N-glycolyl-d-neuraminic acid. According to the IUPAC/IUBMB Recommendations 1996/1997,13 this prefix should not be used, as the d-glycero-d-galacto configuration is implied in the trivial names.",

In the case of Neu, besides N-acetyl or N-glycolyl groups at C5, the hydroxy groups at C4, C7, C8, and C9 may be free, esterified (acetylated, glycolylated, lactylated, sulfated, phosphorylated) or etherified (methylated). Most free sialic acids occur predominantly in the more thermodynamically stable \u03b2-anomeric form (>93%), whereas in nature bound sialic acids, with one exception, possess the \u03b1-anomeric configuration. The exception is the nucleotide-bound sialic acid, the activated CMP-donor, e.g., CMP-\u03b2-Neu5Ac (Fig. 3C). Crystalline Neu5Ac occurs specifically in the \u03b2-anomeric form. The mother molecule Neu and Neu1,5lactam (neuraminic acid 1,5-lactam) (Fig. 3A) only exist in bound form. A number of other members (can) only occur as free form, i.e., Neu5Ac9P (9-O-phospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid), (O-substituted) Neu2en5Ac (Fig. 3B), or Neu2en5Gc (2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-glycolylneuraminic acid), (O-substituted) Neu2,7an5Ac (2,7-anhydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid) (Fig. 3D) or Neu2,7an5Gc (2,7-anhydro-N-glycolylneuraminic acid), and Neu4,8an5Ac (4,8-anhydro-N-acetylneuramic acid) (Fig. 3F) or Neu4,8an5Gc (4,8-anhydro-N-glycolylneuraminic acid). In the case of Kdn, the hydroxy groups at C4, C5, C7, C8, and C9 may be free, esterified (acetylated, phosphorylated) or etherified (methylated). In Neu5Gc, the hydroxy group at C7 can be replaced by an acetamido group, yielding in fact another variant of Neu, with the full name of 7-acetamido-5-hydroxyacetamido-3,5,7-trideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid, so far only found with one or two O-acetyl groups.",

It will describe how the founders of the sialic acid field since the mid-1930s, over a period of more than 20 years, were struggling with the chemical structure of these molecules in a period in which mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy did not exist. And it will show how sialic acid constituents of glycoproteins, glycolipids, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides have grown to be considered biologically and medically highly essential factors of the daily life on earth.",

Elemental analyses yielded C14H24NO11 as the preferred chemical formula. Microacetyl determinations suggested the presence of two acetyl groups in one molecule, whereas a negative ninhydrin reaction supposed the presence of one N-acetyl group. The product had an mp of 140\u2013150\u00b0C (dec.). UV spectroscopy showed the absence of ethylene bonds. The compound turned out to be very sensitive to heating with dilute mineral acid, giving rise to dark humin formation. When heated with Ehrlich's reagent, both with and without alkali pretreatment, an intense red\u2013violet color was formed. Taking into account these and later observations, a disaccharide structure composed of an N-acetylated hexosamine part and a polyhydroxy acid part with six carbon atoms, being not a hexuronic acid, was suggested (note that hexosamine was not isolated from the substance).165, 166, 167 An initial suggestion that the hexosamine part should be chondrosamine (galactosamine)166 was withdrawn when chondrosamine was isolated, separated from \u201cKohlenhydrat I,\u201d and it was stated that both compounds were \u201cprobably bound with an easily split linkage.\u201d167 An additional earlier suggestion was that the polyhydroxy acid could be a deoxy-hexuronic acid.168 Because of the salivary origin of \u201cKohlenhydrat I\u201d (the Greek name for saliva is \u201csialon\u201d), Blix called the compound \u201csialic acid.\u201d167\n",

So, the lipid material was treated with 5% methanolic HCl (3 h, 105\u00b0C), and the released substance was converted, via its barium salt, into the free acid {elemental analysis: preferred chemical formula C11H21NO9; [\u03b1]20\nD \u221254.9\u00b0 (c 3.2, H2O)}. A positive ninhydrin reaction indicated a free amino group, whereas reducing power was not detected. The Bial and Ehrlich colorimetric assays were both strongly positive. Protocols directed to the detection of a hexosamine part in \u201cneuraminic acid\u201d were negative, and a suggestion for an aliphatic polyoxy-aminodicarboxylic acid structure was made. When Klenk realized that the isolated substance contained a methoxy group, introduced during the methanolic-HCl treatment (in the 1950s proved with 14C-labeled CH3OH171), he renamed \u201cneuraminic acid\u201d as \u201cmethoxyneuraminic acid\u201d and kept the name \u201cneuraminic acid\u201d for the compound with chemical formula C10H19NO9 ( \n\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n\n C11H21NO9 \u2212 CH2).172 Then, \u201cneuraminic acid\u201d might contain a reactive carbonyl function, which enabled the formation of a glycosidic linkage with other monosaccharides.

            "text": "Besides scientific interest from the mucin and brain glycolipid research areas for these new, but still unknown compounds, an interesting new angle of incidence came from the virology field. At the end of the 1940s, Burnet reported that the ability of various mucoproteins (i.e., serum mucoprotein, ovarian cyst mucoid, chorionic gonadotropin) to act as competitive inhibitors for hemagglutination by heated influenza B virus was lost after pretreatment of the mucoproteins with active virus.173 Then, Gottschalk and Lind found that incubation of the Melbourne strain of influenza A virus with ovomucin, a protein fraction containing a strong virus hemagglutinin inhibitor, yielded a water-soluble, nitrogen-containing compound with reducing power, that gave, after alkaline treatment, with Ehrlich's reagent, a purple color; furthermore, the Molisch carbohydrate test (concd. H2SO4, \u03b1-naphthol) was strongly positive.174 Acid treatment resulted in black insoluble humin formation. Incubation of ovomucin with a Vibrio cholerae filtrate yielded a substance with similar properties.175 In these years, the enzyme-like agent in the filtrates was called \u201creceptor-destroying enzyme\u201d (RDE) (see Section 11.7). Based on the results so far, the enzymatic liberation of a \u201ccarbohydrate\u2013peptide complex\u201d was suggested, and it was stated that the carbohydrate moiety should be \u201can oligosaccharide containing one or more\nN\n-acyl (acetyl) hexosamine residues linked by an alkali-labile glycosidic linkage to a non-amino-sugar.\u201d Two years later, Gottschalk repeated the incubation experiments with human urinary mucoprotein176 and influenza B virus and suggested now that the released compound should be an \u201cN-substituted\niso\nglucosamine\u201d (a fructosamine; an N-1-deoxy-1-ketose amino acid or peptide).177 Interestingly, the presence of a keto function was indicated by a positive Seliwanoff resorcinol/concd. HCl test, an assay whereby ketoses, in contrast to aldoses, rapidly give a red color (ketoses are more rapidly dehydrated than aldoses with concd. acid).In 1975, Blix described in a letter to Klaus St\u00f6riko (Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany) about his first contact with Gottschalk: \u201c\u2026 I recall how I at the first international biochemist congress in Cambridge 1949 talked with Stacey and Gottschalk, when the latter described the general properties of the carbohydrate component in mucins that inhibited virus haemagglutination and asked for advice from Stacey. It struck me immediately that some of the properties Gottschalk mentioned strongly reminded me about those of sialic acid. When I got home I mailed Gottschalk what we had written about sialic acid and told him that we intended to test the matter closer. Gottschalk obviously did not, at this time, know about sialic acid, which outside Cologne and Uppsala still was of low interest. I had on my part limited knowledge about Burnet's investigations. We agreed later on to study in each of our laboratories the carbohydrate component in the well defined Tamm\u2013Horsfall urinary protein and to publish our results in 1952 simultaneously in Nature \u2026\u201d (from the archive of Blix's scientific correspondence, available at Uppsala University Library).161\n",

Treatment of \u201cN-acetylneuraminic acid\u201d with 40% NaOH (2 h, 100\u00b0C) yielded pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, a product identified 1 year earlier by Gottschalk188 in an alkaline hydrolysate of bovine submaxillary gland mucin (see Section 3). In additional studies, crystalline \u201cN-acetylneuraminic acid\u201d (C12H21NO10) could be obtained from enzymatic incubations of human urinary mucoprotein with influenza virus B-Lee,189 and of human urinary mucoprotein and bovine submandibular gland mucin with the RDE from V. cholerae.190 It was concluded that both the influenza virus and the RDE are acting as O-glycosidases. Following the methanolyis protocol,170 crystalline \u201cmethoxyneuraminic acid\u201d (neuraminic acid methyl glycoside: C11H21NO9) could be isolated from porcine and equine submaxillary gland mucin and bovine colostrum mucin,191 from amyloidose liver,192 from fetuin,193 and from bovine stroma protein.194\nThe paper of Klenk and Uhlenbruck191 gives a clear insight into the competition between Klenk (\u201cneuraminic acid\u201d) and Blix (\u201csialic acid\u201d) in the slowly developing field. At the end of a long criticism in a footnote (we write 1956), Klenk ends with \u201cAs long as the information provided by Blix can not be confirmed by other sources, it must be doubted that a chemically well-defined, uniform compound has been presented here\u201d (translated from the German).\n",

An overview of some physical parameters (elemental analysis, optical rotation, decomposition range, type of N- and O-substituents, the number of hydroxyl functions) is presented in Table 2\n. The chemical formulas for \u201cmethoxyneuraminic acid,\u201d isolated from the mucins and purified \u201csialic acids\u201d following the methanolic HCl protocol of Klenk, were found to be C10H19NO8 (preferred) or C11H21NO9, being the composition earlier reported by Klenk.170 Both the Blix and Klenk \u201cmethoxyneuraminic acid\u201d samples showed the same X-ray powder patterns. Bial's and Ehrlich's reactions gave red\u2013violet and red\u2013purple colors for all four \u201csialic acids,\u201d respectively. As the \u201csialic acids\u201d can be reduced with sodium borohydride and subsequent hydrolysis did not produce a reducing substance, whereas the Bial and Ehrlich tests on the reduced compounds were negative, it was stated that, in contrast to earlier conclusions of the Uppsala group,165 this almost excludes the presence of a glycosidic linkage in \u201csialic acid.\u201d Quantitative determination of hydroxy groups (via an O-acetylation/NaOH titration protocol) showed the presence of five hydroxy groups for the ovine preparation and six hydroxy groups for the porcine preparation. Amino-group determinations revealed the absence of significant amounts of amino nitrogen, so amino groups are substituted. Periodate studies on bovine \u201csialic acid\u201d showed the consumption of 1 mol of periodate and no formic acid production (CH2OH\u2013CHOH\u2013CHOAc\u2013 element), whereas the periodate consumptions for the porcine and ovine \u201csialic acids\u201d were 2 mol of periodate (CH2OH\u2013CHOH\u2013CHOH\u2013 element) and 1 mol of formic acid formation; in all cases 1 mol of formaldehyde was found. As shown in Table 2, the isolated porcine \u201csialic acid\u201d contained an N-glycolyl group, a result confirmed one year later by the Cologne group. Here, \u201cN\n-glycolylneuraminic acid\u201d was chemically and enzymatically released from porcine submaxillary gland mucin, and a colorimetric method for the quantitative determination of glycolic acid was developed.64 See also ref. 196. For further discussions on the structure of the presented \u201csialic acids,\u201d see Section 3. To give an impression of the use of X-ray powder diffraction analysis for comparison purposes, Fig. 6\nillustrates the diagrams of various \u201csialic acids.\u201d",

The precursor of pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid was supposed to be pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylic acid, stabilized by the engagement of its enolic hydroxy group in an O-glycosidic linkage apparently with a pentose, being the released substance. The latter compound is very sensitive to alkaline hydrolysis. The choice of position 4 for the hydroxy group was based on the biogenetic relationship to hydroxyproline. In a subsequent paper from 1955, however, an isomeric structure for the O-glycosyl-pyrrole-2-carboxylic was assumed (Scheme 2B).219 In aqueous solution, such a structure will undergo a reversible ring opening, yielding a product that would be unstable to alkali (or acid), and gives, under the expulsion of the sugar, pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid.From a citation of Gottschalk218 discussing the earlier report of Hiyama215 about the formation of pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (see Scheme 1): \u201cIt is not known whether pyrrolidines are transformed into pyrroles under the conditions applied, and Hiyama's results cannot therefore be interpreted.\u201d\n",

Taking into account the revised chemical formula C13H21NO10\u00b7H2O for bovine \u201csialic acid,\u201d195 with one N- and one O-acetyl group, C9-sugar structures were constructed as depicted in Scheme 3\n.220 In this proposal, \u201cneuraminic acid\u201d c is presented as an aldol type of condensation product of a 2-amino-2-deoxy-hexose with pyruvic acid. For the cyclization to pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid d, the \u03b1-keto function, the \u03b4-amino function, and the \u03b3-hydroxyl function of the open deacetylated chain (a\n \u2192 \nc) are in the right positions relative to the carboxyl group. Blix and coworkers stated that the supposed pyranose ring form is in accordance with their periodate experiments, carried out on bovine, porcine, ovine, and equine \u201csialic acids.\u201d23 Gottschalk's proposal also included for terminal \u201cN-acetylneuraminic acid\u201d an enzymatic release from mucoproteins via a glycosidase instead of an amidase.97, 221 See also ref. 190. A first unraveling of the mechanism behind the enzymatic release had to wait until the 1980s.The citation of Blix and coworkers (1956) in view of their finding that the O-acetyl group should be on C7 instead of C4 (Scheme 3): \u201cThe bovine \u2018sialic acid\u2019 consumes only 1 mole of oxidant per mole, and produces no formic acid. This indicates that the C7 group is acetylated in this substance. The position of the O-acetyl group in Gottschalk's formula is therefore probably wrong.\u201d23 The structure was corrected in 1957.222\n",

The problems with the great variations in elemental analyses (including separate nitrogen determinations) on different preparations of the isolated substances, published over a long period of time, certainly delayed the progress in the field. One of the causes for these variations was due to the frequent use of methanol in work-up procedures, leading to contaminating methyl-esterification of the relatively strong acids. Another complication was mentioned to be the hygroscopicity of the substances. But also the possible presence of closely related family members in specific preparations should not be excluded.",

Sialic acid is suggested as group name for the acylated neuraminic acids (for example, N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and diacetylneuraminic acids). For the enzyme, which splits the glycosidic linkage joining the terminal sialic acid to the residual oligo- or polysaccharide, the names neuraminidase and sialidase may be used synonymously. We have agreed to use this nomenclature in future.\u201d223 Looking back, one can say that this joint statement was really a breakthrough after many years of experiments and competition.Gottschalk wrote in a letter to Klenk (in 1957) about the final phase of the Nature publication: \u201c\u2026 I have just returned the corrected proofs of our joint note to Nature, ordered and paid 250 reprints in all and asked the printers to send all reprints to you. I am sorry that I could not consult you with regard to the reprints; however, I had to deal with the proof by return mail and the reprints have to be ordered when returning the proof. I have informed Blix accordingly and asked him to claim reprints (up to 85) from you.

Because of the anomeric C2 atom, \u201clactaminic acid\u201d should occur in \u03b1- and \u03b2-forms; therefore, it was surprising that no mutarotation was observed (see Section 4.3). Also Zilliken and Glick demonstrated that incubation of \u201cgynaminic acid\u201d (N-acetylneuraminic acid) with 0.1 M NaOH (5\u201310 min at 90\u00b0C) afforded d-GlcNAc and pyruvic acid.226 In another study, incubation of bovine submaxillary gland mucin with a V. cholerae filtrate, containing the RDE, yielded besides sialic acid, also d-GlcNAc, leading to the suggestion that still another enzyme should be present in the extract.227 Additional incubation of sialic acid with the same extract gave equimolar amounts of d-GlcNAc and pyruvic acid, and an aldolase mechanism for this splitting was suggested (see Section 12). Finally, N-acetylneuraminic acid could be synthesized from d-GlcNAc and oxaloacetic acid at pH 11 in 1%\u20132% yield (Scheme 4\n).228\n",

In the case of N-acetylneuraminic acid, the N-acyl-hexosamine was identified as N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (d-ManNAc), not d-GlcNAc (Fig. 10, Structure II). Note that the d-configuration was established by a chemical degradation reaction of mannosamine, yielding d-arabinose. Note also that d-GlcNAc and d-ManNAc could only be separated by paper chromatography, when using borate-treated paper. The reaction was reversible; thus incubation of d-ManNAc and pyruvate using this enzyme led to the formation of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Scheme 5\n). The enzyme was inactive with d-GlcNAc and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (d-GalNAc). Phosphoenolpyruvate could not replace pyruvate. In view of its activity, the enzyme was called N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase [later called sialate (acylneuraminate)-pyruvate lyase; see Section 12]. Incubation of the enzyme with N-glycolyl-d-mannosamine and pyruvic acid afforded N-glycolylneuraminic acid.",

However, using borate-treated paper in a time-course experiment, the initial formation of d-ManNAc, next to d-GlcNAc, was clearly seen. The d-ManNAc \u2194 d-GlcNAc reversible epimerization (ratio 1:4) was also observed in aqueous alkaline solution (pH 10\u201311) at room temperature,233, 234, 235 thereby explaining the earlier results of Zilliken and Glick226 and of Cornforth and coworkers.228 Repetition of the synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid from oxaloacetic acid and either d-GlcNAc or d-ManNAc confirmed this view. In both cases N-acetylneuraminic acid was formed (Scheme 6\n; Fig. 10, Structure II).235, 236 Replacing oxaloacetic acid by its di-tert-butyl ester gave higher yields.237 In a repeated study, incubating N-acetylneuraminic acid with a V. cholerae filtrate (pH 6.1, 70 h, 37\u00b0C), d-ManNAc, but not d-GlcNAc, was found.238 The earlier observation of splitting into d-GlcNAc and pyruvate227 was also attributable to a paper chromatography protocol that could not separate d-GlcNAc and d-ManNAc.238 In another report, the system d-ManNAc/phosphoenolpyruvate/ATP/rat liver extract (not d-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc; not pyruvic acid) was described for the synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid.239 Finally, several years later a protocol was described to determine the absolute configuration of N-acetylneuraminic acid by converting it into d-arabinose by chemical degradation.240\n",

Isolated crystalline N-acetylneuraminic acid showed an increasing mutarotation in (CH3)2SO as follows: [\u03b1]23\nD \u2212115\u00b0 (t\n = 7 min) \u2192 \u221237\u00b0 (t\n = 23 min) \u2192 \u221224\u00b0 (final value) (c 0.2) (extrapolated to t\n = 0 min, [\u03b1]23\nD should be \u2212150\u00b0 to \u2212200\u00b0). This observation was correlated with the \u03b2-form for the crystalline product, which means that the OH group at C2 in the Fischer formula should project to the left.242 As in H2O no change in mutarotation was observed, it was concluded that in this solvent the mutarotation was too fast (strong acid) to be followed in the polarimeter. Note that in other studies no mutarotation could be observed in (CH3)2SO,247 whereas in H2O mutarotation was seen.248 Applying Hudson's isorotation rules,249 comparison of the optical rotations in (CH3)2SO of (N-acetylneuraminic acid)-(\u03b1,\u03b2-lactose) ([\u03b1]23\nD +6\u00b0), \u03b1,\u03b2-lactose ([\u03b1]23\nD +53\u00b0), and assumed \u03b2-N-acetylneuraminic acid ([\u03b1]23\nD \u2212150\u00b0 to \u2212200\u00b0; see above), it was hypothesized that the bound N-acetylneuraminic acid occurred in the \u03b1-form.

Both compounds were subjected to mild periodate oxidation followed by sodium borohydride reduction, and the degradation products that formed were treated with N,N\u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in pyridine (Scheme 10\n). The C7 product related to the sialidase-sensitive methyl glycoside did not give rise to lactone formation, whereas the C7 product related to the sialidase-resistant methyl glycoside gave rise to lactone formation. IR analysis of the isolated lactone fraction [preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC)] revealed evidence for a \u03b4 (major) +  \u03b3 (minor) lactone mixture. The trimethylsilyl derivative of the major lactone, isolated via gas\u2013liquid chromatography (GLC), was analyzed by electron-impact mass spectrometry (EIMS), and shown to be a \u03b4-lactone. Boat conformations of the lactones were supported by Dreiding modeling. All these findings were in agreement with an axial orientation of the carboxyl function (\u03b1-configuration) in the case of the sialidase-susceptible methyl glycoside and with an equatorial orientation of the carboxyl function (\u03b2-configuration) in the case of the sialidase-resistant methyl glycoside. So, sialidases (here V. cholerae sialidase) were proven to be \u03b1-sialidases (see Section 11.7). Note that also the glycerol-side-chain-trimmed \u03b1-anomer was susceptible to sialidase, but the \u03b2-analogue not susceptible. Note also that N-acetyl-\u03b1-neuraminic acid methyl ester methyl glycoside was totally inactive with sialidase, which is contrary to results published three years earlier.255\n",

In comparison with permethylated N-glycolylneuraminic acid, the EIMS fragmentation pattern of permethylated SiaX supported a structure in which the N(CH3)COCH2OCH3 group at C5 was replaced by an OCH3 group (for EIMS data of sialic acids, see Section 5). Further support for a hydroxy group instead of an N-acyl group at C5 was supplied by the 1H NMR spectrum of the SiaX methyl ester methyl glycoside (for NMR data of sialic acids, see Section 5). The spectrum turned out to be identical with deaminated neuraminic acid methyl ester methyl glycoside, synthesized from N-glycolylneuraminic acid.260 Referring to the earlier work of Roseman et al. (Section 4.1), incubation of free SiaX with N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase yielded d-mannose and pyruvate. Finally, SiaX showed the same absorption spectrum as N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminic acid in the thiobarbituric acid assay. In conclusion, SiaX could be assigned as 3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid. For information with respect to the metabolism of Kdn and the enzymatic release of this sialic acid from glycoconjugates, see Sections 11.5.3 and 11.7, respectively.",

As mentioned in Section 2.1, the first studies, reported in 1936, spoke of the presence of an O-acetyl group in the unknown substance, isolated from bovine submandibular gland mucin.165 It is to be noted that for the release of (O-acylated) sialic acids from sialoglycoconjugates/sialooligosaccharides, the chosen acid hydrolysis conditions must be such that the labile glycosidic linkage between sialic acid and a neighboring monosaccharide is efficiently cleaved, but also that the applied conditions do not cause too much de-esterification. Note that conditions that are too harsh lead to acid- and heat-mediated degradation to chromogens (humin formation). Over the years, the three acid hydrolysis systems most applied are formic acid pH 2.0 (1 h, 70\u00b0C) [in later years followed by HCl pH 1.0 (1 h, 80\u00b0C)],24, 104 2 M acetic acid (3 h, 80\u00b0C),261 and 2 M propionic acid (4 h, 80\u00b0C)262; however, other systems have been advocated. Although these conditions do not lead to significant N-deacylation, O-deacylation has been shown to occur to an extent of approximately 30%\u201350%. The use of aqueous H2SO4 is no longer recommended.6, 33, 154 Besides mild acid hydrolysis, in later years sialidases made their appearance.6, 154 As mentioned in Section 2.1, even the acidity of mucin suspensions (pH 3.5\u20134.0) was low enough to initiate release of sialic acids.23\n",

Furthermore, it was suggested that the bovine material also contained Neu5,7,8Ac3, and the equine material Neu4,5,?Ac3. The consumption lines of Neu5Ac and Neu4,5Ac2 showed overconsumption after 40 min, due to opening of the pyranose ring. In theory, Neu5,8Ac2 should give no consumption of periodate; the slow consumption of periodate (0.25 mol/mol sialic acid in 40 min) combined with only a partial positive Aminoff test (extinction coefficient 47% of that obtained with free Neu5Ac) was explained as the result of a slow O-deacetylation. In fact, a possible presence of Neu5,9Ac2 was excluded, because the combination of \u201c1 mol periodate consumption and a positive Aminoff test\u201d was not found. The number of N-glycolyl groups was estimated using a microanalysis protocol for glycolic acid,270 and the number of O-acetyl groups was determined with the colorimetric Hestrin assay (alkaline hydroxylamine/Fe(ClO4)3; see Section 7.1).271 Note that all bovine sialic acids could also be released with the sialidases of V. cholerae and C. perfringens, although at different rates, but equine Neu4,5Ac2 and di-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (presumably one of the O-acetyl groups attached at C4) were resistant to these enzymes (see Section 11.5.2). In the same period, Neu5,8Ac2, assigned via polarographic periodate oxidation studies, was found to occur in fish brain gangliosides.272\n",

            "text": "A few years later (1975), a novel technology for the analysis of N,O-acylneuraminic acids, namely, GLC\u2013EIMS, was introduced by Vliegenthart/Kamerling and coworkers at Utrecht University (the Netherlands).26, 27 To this end, the isolated sialic acids were esterified with diazomethane, followed by trimethylsilylation of the free hydroxy groups. In a later protocol, the sialic acids were pertrimethylsilylated.33 Analysis of the mass spectra suggested strongly that all N,O-acylneuraminic acids with an earlier identified 8-O-acetyl group by periodate oxidation, in fact, had to be assigned with an O-acetyl group at C9. This change in assignment was based on mass spectrometric fragmentation patterns that originated from the mass spectral analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates.273, 274, 275 For cleavage of the latter compounds, at the end of the 1960s it had been demonstrated that the charge is preferentially located on an ether oxygen instead of on an ester oxygen atom. Translated to the sialic acid situation, it meant that, in general, cleavage occurs between two trimethylsiloxylated carbon atoms, or between an acetoxylated and a trimethylsiloxylated carbon atom with location of the charge on the ether oxygen, rather than between an acetoxylated and a trimethylsiloxylated carbon atom with location of the charge on the ester oxygen, or between two acetoxylated carbon atoms (Fig. 14A). The mass spectra obtained for the different sialic acid derivatives gave rise to highly specific fragmentation patterns A\u2013H, both for N,O-acylneuraminic acids and for N-acyl-O-alkyl-neuraminic acids (Fig. 14B).6, 27, 30, 33, 275 Fragments A and B indicate the molecular mass of the sialic acid derivatives, and thus the number and type of substituents. Fragments C\u2013H contain the information concerning the position of the different substituents. Fragment C only has significant abundance if C7 bears an ether group; when an ester group is present at C7, this fragment is absent or hardly observable. The occurrence of fragment D is dependent on the presence of fragment C. Fragment E is not seen if an O-acyl group is attached to C4. Fragment F can be readily formed only if an ether group is attached at C8. As an illustration, the mass spectra of Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac2 are presented in Fig. 15\n. Additional mass spectra of various members of the sialic acid family can be found in refs. 6, 30, 33, 104, as well as in the references included in Table 1. For tables of m/z data of the A\u2013H fragments and GLC retention times of various sialic acid derivatives, see refs. 6, 26, 27, 30, 33, as well as the references included in Table 1.",

The products formed were 6-O-acetyl-N-acetylmannosamine and 6-O-acetyl-N-glycolylmannosamine, respectively, as proven by GLC\u2013EIMS.27 Furthermore, synthetic \u03b2-Neu5,9Ac21,2Me2 and \u03b2-Neu4,5,9Ac31,2Me2, of which the structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, were subjected to mass spectrometry and periodate oxidation studies. Indeed, both derivatives showed mass spectrometric fragmentation patterns similar to those found for \u03b2-Neu5,9Ac2 and \u03b2-Neu4,5,9Ac3, and consumed only ~0.15 mol of periodate/mol of sialic acid within 10 min (\u03b2-Neu5Ac1,2Me2 consumed 2 mol of periodate/mol sialic acid within 10 min).276 An explanation for the resistance of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids to periodate oxidation was stated to originate from the staggered anti orientation of the OH groups at C7 and C8, stabilized by some hydrogen-bonding network, that hampers the formation of a diol\u2013periodate complex (see Section 6). It seems to take time to create the complex with both OH groups in a cis configuration, as over a period of 48 h a higher periodate consumption (85% of their theoretical value) was seen for both compounds, only partially due to O-deacetylation. Neu5Ac9Lt behaved in the same way as Neu5,9Ac2 (consumption of only ~0.10 mol of periodate/mol sialic acid within 10 min).42 Periodate oxidation of Neu5Ac9P yielded glycolaldehyde phosphate, indicating a splitting of the C7\u2013C8 bond, and a positive thiobarbituric acid color reaction (extinction coefficient 78% of that obtained with free Neu5Ac).51 Also Neu5Gc9S turned out to be easily susceptible to periodate oxidation.72 In view of the literature protocols followed, it seems that in both cases the oxidation had been carried out for several hours. It should be noted that on treatment of \u03b2-Neu5Ac1,2Me2 with low amounts of periodate, the C8\u2013C9 diol group is preferentially oxidized, as was shown by the high ratio of the aldehyde of the 8-carbon analogue to the aldehyde of the 7-carbon analogue obtained.277 The aldehyde of the 8-carbon analogue, being a 2-hydroxyaldehyde, is further oxidized if the amount of periodate is sufficient. So, the oxidation of the C7\u2013C8 diol group will be hindered if the formation of the mentioned aldehyde is blocked by the presence of an O-acetyl group at C9. See also refs. 6, 30, 277, and 278 for periodate/borohydride degradation studies on the glycoprotein level, generating bound C8-\u03b1-Neu5Ac, C7-\u03b1-Neu5Ac, C8-\u03b1-Neu5Gc, and/or C7-\u03b1-Neu5Gc.",

Underivatized N,O-acylneuraminic acids were successfully analyzed by combined HPLC\u2013CIMS (chemical ionization mass spectrometry), although localization of O-substituents based on CIMS data alone was not possible.279 Although CIMS of pertrimethylsilylated sialic acid derivatives gave less fragmentation than EIMS, GLC\u2013CIMS also furnished suitable information for identification purposes.104, 280 Furthermore, a methodology based on HPLC, coupled with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS), has been developed.32 To this end fluorescent sialic acid derivatives were prepared by reaction with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) (see Section 7.2). A combination of HPLC retention times and ESI mass spectra allowed the assignment of the type and position of the various substituents.32, 33 A similar approach, but now using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS), has also been developed.281 Analogous to the GLC\u2013EIMS analysis of trimethylsilylated sialic acids, a GLC\u2013EIMS methodology for the analysis of heptafluorobutyrylated (HFB) sialic acid methyl ester derivatives has been worked out.19 Here, the EI mass spectra are rather complex; a survey of reporter fragment ions and GLC data of specific members of the sialic acid family can be found in refs. 19, 33. For EI mass spectra of acetylated derivatives, see ref. 25. For fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) studies of sialic acid derivatives, see ref. 31.",

The first three compounds had an axial OR (R = CH3 or OH) group at C2 (proof for \u03b2-anomer), while the fourth compound had an equatorial OCH3 group at C2 (proof for \u03b1-anomer). The equatorial glycerol side chain of all four compounds was found to occur in an extended, staggered conformation with the OH groups at C7 and C8 in anti orientation. In general, extensive three-dimensional systems of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, also involving H2O molecules, were seen. In the context of the conformation of the glycerol side chain, intramolecular hydrogen bonds are of interest. For \u03b2-Neu5Ac1Me\u00b7H2O, 1 intramolecular hydrogen bond between HO7 and the carbonyl O of NHCOCH3 was detected. In the case of \u03b1-Neu5Ac1,2Me2, intramolecular hydrogen bonds were detected between HO7 and the carbonyl O of the planar NHCOCH3 group (trans configuration of the peptide bond), and between HO8 and the carbonyl O of the COOCH3 group (Fig. 16\n).

In a first study,28 taking into account the values of the vicinal coupling constants J\n6,7, J\n7,8, J\n8,9, and J\n8,9\u2032 (Table 3), the lowest energy conformation of the extended C7\u2013C8\u2013C9 side chain was believed to be as depicted in Fig. 20A. Here, H6 and H7 are placed in a staggered gauche, H7 and H8 in a staggered anti, H8 and H9 in a staggered gauche, and H8 and H9\u2032 in a staggered anti orientation. In this spatial model the H of HO7 can form a hydrogen bond with the ring O, and the H of HO8 a hydrogen bond with the O of HO9 (two five-membered ring interactions). In another study, using hard-sphere, exo-anomeric (HSEA) calculations, the latter model (Fig. 20A) got support.295\n",

In contrast, especially models with intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the HO7 and the NHCOCH3 group, and between the HO8 and the ring O or the COOH function (in case of the \u03b1-configuration), leading to a strong hydrogen-bonding network between the glycerol side chain and the 2\nC\n5 pyranose ring conformation, pop up.

Because of the strong acidic conditions used, the method is suitable for the quantification of total amounts of free and glycosidically bound sialic acid. Note that O-acyl groups are split off. When applied during the fractionation of biological materials, the Bial assay is therefore typically a reaction to monitor the presence of sialic acids. As other carbohydrates (pentoses, hexoses, uronic acids) can strongly disturb the determination of small amounts of sialic acid, quantification usually requires purified samples. To overcome some of the problems, different variants of the Bial reaction have been explored. With a focus on contaminating 2-ketohexoses, a suitable variant reagent to measure total sialic acid, namely, resorcinol/concd. HCl/CuSO4, was worked out by Svennerholm. It proved to be 30%\u201350% more sensitive than the Bial assay.310, 311 Here, free or bound sialic acid samples are mixed with the reagent and heated for 15 min at 110\u00b0C, and the formed blue\u2013violet chromophore is extracted with amyl alcohol followed by measurement of the absorbance at 580 nm, and also at 450 nm to correct for 2-ketohexoses (for further information, see refs. 269, 312, and 313).

H3PO4\n266 vs 0.06 M H2SO4\n265), and (ii) the use of cyclohexanone266 or acidic n-butanol265 for the extraction of the chromophore. In the periodate oxidation step (followed by an arsenite step), a chromogen is generated, predicted to be \u03b2-formylpyruvic acid, which gives a red chromophore with 2-thiobarbituric acid with \u03bb\nmax 549 nm. A proposed reaction mechanism of the assay is presented in Scheme 13\n.100, 268 In contrast to Warren,266 it was stated by Paerels and Schut268 that a conversion of the N-acyl group into a free amino group under the acidic periodate oxidation conditions (room temperature; incubation for a relatively short time) is not obvious, because of the high stability of an amide bond. As sialic acid glycosides did not react in the Warren and Aminoff tests, sialic acid glycosidic linkages are not hydrolyzed under the assay conditions. Furthermore, it was presumed that \u03b2-formylpyruvic acid is not a direct product of the periodate oxidation, but the result of an acid-catalyzed C4\u2013C5 aldol splitting of the true oxidation product (for Neu5Ac: formed after consumption of 3 mol of periodate; see the upper part of Scheme 13) during the incubation with the acid solution of 2-thiobarbituric acid at 100\u00b0C. The red pigment was earlier prepared in the crystalline form from a derivative of \u03b2-formylpyruvic acid, and proven to be a condensation product of 2 mol of 2-thiobarbituric acid and 1 mol of \u03b2-formylpyruvic acid.318 It may be clear that O-substitutions of the glycerol side chain will influence the prechromogen formation (see discussion in Section 5), and a test after O-deacetylation was advised. In case of Neu4,5Ac2, an O-deacetylation at C4 during the reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid before the aldol splitting was suggested. See the comments on the analysis of Kdn, which directly yields \u03b2-formylpyruvic acid.314\n",

In the following, some typical examples will be presented. Reaction of sialic acid with 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid dihydrochloride in hot dilute HCl yields an intense green fluorescent condensation product (405 nm excitation, 510 nm emission) (free and bound sialic acids react equally).321 Reaction of sialic acid with pyridoxamine in the presence of zinc acetate and pyridine/methanol for 45 min at 70\u00b0C yields a highly fluorescent chelate (395 nm excitation, 470 nm emission; Scheme 14\n) (free sialic acids).322, 323 The fluorescence of the chromophoric product, obtained from sialic acid in the periodate/2-thiobarbituric acid assay (Scheme 13), is readily detected by excitation at 550 nm and analysis of the emission at 570 nm. Here, special attention has been paid to contamination with 2-deoxyribose.324 Finally, a different approach has been worked out, whereby free or glycosidically bound sialic acid was subjected to mild periodate oxidation. This method also allowed the discrimination between sialic acids with or without O-acyl groups at the glycerol side chain by O-deacetylation of a parallel sample (for a discussion of the mild periodate oxidation of sialic acids, see Section 5). The released formaldehyde, derived from C9 in the case of nonsubstituted HO9 and HO8 functions, is derivatized with acetylacetone in the presence of ammonium acetate, yielding the slightly yellow chromophore 3,5-diacetyl-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine,325 of which the fluorescence can be detected by excitation at 410 nm and analysis of the emission at 510 nm (Scheme 15\n).326 Using this methodology, it could be demonstrated that rapid O-deacetylation of Neu5,9Ac2 occurred only at pH values below 2 and above 11. When incubated for 10 min at 58\u00b0C, no significant loss of O-acetyl groups were seen in the range of pH 2\u201311.327\n",

Coupling of the aldolase-catalyzed cleavage reaction of N-acylneuraminic acids to the lactate dehydrogenase/NADH-catalyzed reduction of pyruvate to lactate drives the lyase reaction, otherwise an equilibrium reaction, to completion. Initially, the amount of pyruvate (and thus the amount of sialic acid) was calculated from the amount of oxidized NADH, measured spectrophotometrically by the change in absorbance at 340 nm.329 In the course of time, various commercial colorimetric and fluorimetric assays have been developed for the estimation of oxidized NADH. Note that the reaction rate of the cleavage by aldolase is influenced by the sialic acid O-substitution pattern, e.g., it has been found that O-acyl groups at the sialic acid glycerol side chain lead to a reduction in the reaction rate of 30%\u201350%, while O-acetylation at C4 gives 90% reduction.41, 330, 331\n",

The greater resolution, combined with improved reproducibility, made TLC for many years the technique of choice for screening and (tentative) assignments of sialic acids. Especially, Schauer and coworkers at the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, and later at the Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel, contributed greatly to the development of TLC technologies. Although several solvents were developed, the most popular flow systems turned out to be propan-1-ol/butan-1-ol/0.1 M HCl (2:1:1, v/v/v) for cellulose sheets (Fig. 23\n), and propan-1-ol/water (7:3, v/v) for silica gel sheets. For R\nf values of different sialic acids, see refs. 6 and 269. For the visualization of the sialic acid members, in most cases, the Bial reagent (orcinol/concd. HCl/FeCl3) was used, yielding typical purple\u2013blue bands. Periodate combined with resorcinol/CuSO4 and periodate combined with arsenite and thiobarbituric acid sprays were also developed. For a further differentiation between N,O-acylneuraminic acids with similar R\nf values in one direction, a two-dimensional TLC method with intermediate saponification, carried out on cellulose sheets with the solvent system mentioned earlier, was developed. The intermediate exposure to an atmosphere of ammonia vapor over a 5 M NH4OH solution (2 h, room temperature) generates Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from their O-acyl derivatives.41, 334 A two-dimensional technique on cellulose sheets was also developed for O-acyl group identifications. After a separation in the first dimension using propan-1-ol/butan-1-ol/0.1 M HCl (2:1:1, v/v/v), the lane of migrated sialic acids is sprayed with Hestrin's alkaline hydroxylamine reagent and left for 60 min. Then, the plate is developed in the second dimension using propan-1-ol/10% aq (NH4)2CO3/5 M NH4OH (6:2:1, v/v/v). Visualization of the acylhydroxamates is carried out with a 10% FeCl3 spray.41, 334\n",

So, rapid screening of sialic acids in biological materials, affording assignments based on retention times, whereby contaminating substances (e.g., other monosaccharides) did not interfere, could be developed. Also the monitoring of fast transitions between members of the sialic acid family due to migration of substituents, the introduction of substituents, the cleavage of substituents, or other (enzymatic) modifications became possible.",

Initially, methods for Neu5Ac were developed using an anion-exchange resin combined with a periodate/arsenite/thiobarbituric acid colorimetric detection assay,349 a cation-exchange resin combined with UV detection at 206 nm,350 and an amino column combined with UV detection at 195 nm.351 Chromophores, obtained by treatment of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc with periodate/arsenite/thiobarbituric acid, were analyzed on a reversed-phase C18 column, monitored at 549 nm.352 As it was realized that analysis of complex mixtures of sialic acids should require other approaches, the focus was switched to generally applicable methods (for a review, see ref. 6). A first report proposed the use of an anion-exchange resin in borate buffer (pH 8.55), whereby nonderivatized sialic acids were separated as sugar\u2013borate complexes. For the detection, the effluent was mixed with 4,4\u2032-dicarboxy-2,2\u2032-biquinoline disodium salt/CuSO4 (5.4 min, 100\u00b0C), and the chromophores (Cu+/4,4\u2032-dicarboxy-2,2\u2032-biquinoline complexes) that formed were monitored at 570 nm.353, 354, 355 At the same time a different anion-exchange chromatography method was reported, making use of sodium sulfate as mobile phase and UV detection at 195 or 215 nm.356 Great progress in HPLC approaches was made by the combination of reversed-phase HPLC with fluorometric detection systems and, in a later stage, with additional coupling to MS. To this end fluorescent sialic acid derivatives were prepared by reaction with DMB (373 nm excitation; 448 nm emission) (Scheme 16\n)357, 358, 359 or o-phenylenediamine (OPD) (232 nm excitation; 420 nm emission).360 In an evaluation of seven different HPLC methods, including high-performacnce anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC\u2013PAD) (see ref. 361), it turned out that no single method is adequate to completely separate and quantitate complex mixtures of sialic acids.362 For a quantification protocol of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc by a stable isotope dilution assay using HPLC coupled with ESIMS, see ref. 363. For a more detailed overview of HPLC procedures, see ref. 6.",

            "text": "In the context of this section, attention will be paid to some NMR studies of sialic acids. As shown in 5, 11.5.2, the value of 1H NMR spectroscopy for the characterization of N,O-acylneuraminic acids and for the migration of O-acetyl groups along the glycerol side chain was clearly demonstrated. NMR spectroscopy also proved to be of great value for unraveling of the mechanism of the release of bound sialic acid and for the assignment of the type of glycosidic linkage [e.g., (\u03b12\u21923), (\u03b12\u21926), (\u03b12\u21928); see also Section 8.6]. Following the incubation of Neu5Ac(\u03b12\u21923 or 6) conjugates with bacterial (C. perfringens, Arthrobacter ureafaciens, V. cholerae, Bifidobacterium) and viral (fowl plague virus) sialidases in an NMR tube, NMR spectroscopy showed in a fast process at first instance the formation of free \u03b1-Neu5Ac in high amounts, which then mutarotates in a slower process to the equilibrium \u03b1-Neu5Ac:\u03b2-Neu5Ac = 8:92. The anomerization could be followed easily via the intensities of the H3e, H3a, and N-acetyl signals of both anomers (see Section 6.2; Table 3).370, 371, 372 Fortunately, the initial high concentration of \u03b1-Neu5Ac made it now possible to follow the mutarotation in more detail than described in Section 4.3. But it should be said that the rapidity of the \u03b1-Neu5Ac \u2192 \u03b2-Neu5Ac mutarotation depends on the pH. At pD 5.4, being the pH for an optimal cleavage of 2-azido-\u03b1-Neu5Ac with C. perfringens sialidase, the process turned out to be rather slow, but at higher and lower pD values a more rapid establishment of the equilibrium of mutarotation was observed. At pD 1.3 and pD 11.7 the mutarotation was too fast to be measured (no indications for open-chain structures or lactones).373 For GLC\u2013EIMS studies on the release of Neu5Ac from substrates by sialidases in the presence of H2[18O], see ref. 374. The fact that the cleavage by these sialidases passed with retention of anomeric configuration received support in a later mechanistic study with the sialidase from influenza virus.375 These results were in contradiction with an earlier report that Neu5Ac, liberated by the enzymatic cleavage of the \u03b1-linked Neu5Ac, leaves the catalytic site of V. cholerae sialidase as the \u03b2-anomer, which meant an inversion of anomeric configuration in the mechanism.247 However, such a mechanism was later proposed in case of Salmonella typhimurium sialidase.376, 377 With the ability to generate \u03b1-Neu5Ac in situ, the aldolase-catalyzed degradation of Neu5Ac to pyruvate and ManNAc (in fact \u03b1-ManNAc, followed by a fast mutarotation to \u03b1,\u03b2-ManNAc) could also be investigated in more detail using 1H NMR spectroscopy.378, 379\n",

A few years later, in 1950 and 1952, Leblond and coworkers used the technology in combination with light microscopy.382, 383 After periodate oxidation, tissues of different animals were stained with fuchsine\u2013sulfurous acid, a technique developed by Hotchkiss.384 At these times, the nature of the molecules in tissues, oxidized by periodic acid, was not yet known.",

In subsequent years, the PAS technique developed into a powerful technique of sialic acid staining, because of the sensitivity of its glycerol side chain to mild periodate oxidation, thereby generating aldehyde functions. Typical examples are the detection of vicinal hydroxy groups (mostly of sialic acids) in plasma membranes by electron microscopy.386, 387 In an early review,388 the periodate acid\u2013Schiff technique, together with other methods for the detection of acidic groups/acidic glycoproteins of plasma membranes, e.g., using cationic compounds such as colloidal iron, thorium hydroxide, Alcian blue, and ruthenium red, used earlier for light or electron microscopy, is summarized. The studies confirmed that all cell surfaces seem to be covered by a carbohydrate-rich coat. In a thorough investigation on complex carbohydrates (glycoproteins) in the Golgi apparatus of rat cells, two electron microscopy visualization methods, based on (1) successive treatment of sections with periodic acid, chromic acid, and silver methenamine, and (2) brief treatment of sections with a mixture of chromic acid and phosphotungstic acid, were compared with the PAS technique using light microscopy, and the staining results obtained were shown to be identical/similar.389\n",

Until the mid-1970s, 9-O-acetylated sialic acids were believed to be cleavable between C7 and C8 (see fig. 1 of ref. 391). However, as discussed in Section 5, in the same period (1974), this assumption turned out to be incorrect.276 So, PAS-resistant sialic acids can be substituted at C9 and not necessarily at C8. Neu4,5Ac2 is fully PAS positive (but sialidase resistant). The specificity of this sialic acid-staining technique can be increased by previous sialidase or acid treatment of tissue slices. The difference of staining intensity with and without alkali treatment enables a rough estimation of the degree of O-acetylation in the glycerol side chain.",

First, a light microscopic histochemical localization of sialic acids (sialoglycoconjugates) in tissue sections of eccrine glands of porcine snout skin could be carried out by employing a method that includes a selective periodate oxidation\u2013phenylhydrazine blockade and a thiocarbohydrazide\u2013silver protein sequence, followed by a physical development procedure.395, 396 Second, for the in situ imaging by confocal laser microscopy and flow cytometric quantification of sialylated glycoproteins on living human gastric normal and cancer cells, the cell lines were treated by mild periodate oxidation (1 mM, 4\u00b0C, up to 20 min), and the aldehyde functions generated on the glycoproteins were ligated with the fluorescence tag, fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide.397 Note that the chosen periodate oxidation conditions only introduce aldehyde groups into the sialic acid glycerol side chains of the glycoproteins on the living cell surface.",

The specificities of the methods, developed for sialic acid linkage analysis, were higher than those developed using the periodate reaction.398 Especially, the sialyl(\u03b12\u21923)-specific Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) and the sialyl(\u03b12\u21926)-specific Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) found wide application [and more rarely Limax flavus agglutinin (LFA)] in the lectin histochemical localization of glycoconjugates containing Neu5Ac in (\u03b12\u21923) and (\u03b12\u21926) linkage, respectively, to Gal and GalNAc. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) also interacts with Neu5Ac (not Neu5Gc), but according to a discussion with J\u00fcrgen Roth (University of Zurich, Switzerland), the lectin is not suited for sialic acid analysis. For the detection of sialic acid with these lectins, for example, a peroxidase\u2013antibody\u2013peroxidase complex (PAPS), which can be visualized, is in use. In the same period, the labeling of lectins and immunoglobulins with ferritin, and especially colloidal gold particles, used in both light and electron microscopy, got wide attention. J\u00fcrgen Roth (\u201cImmunogold Master,\u201d \u201cMr. Compartment\u201d399) and collaborators developed, most elegantly and frequently applied, the lectin\u2013gold technique for human and animal tissues, including the Golgi complex.400, 401, 402 Typical examples of staining of normal human colonic mucosa and colon carcinoma with MAA and SNA are shown in Fig. 24\n.

            "text": "In more recent years, virolectins have shown to be also powerful reagents for histochemical detection of sialic acids. For example, influenza C viruses bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in tissue slices from rat liver or human colon and are immunologically detected by incubation with rabbit antiserum, followed by treatment with fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG antibody for visualization.404 Staining is also possible by the esterase activity of the bound viruses. In a similar way, such staining has also been done with a soluble form of influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase, wherein the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are replaced by the Fc portion of human IgG. This complex (CHE-Fc) retains both its recognition and enzymatic function. It is detected on the cryosections with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antihuman IgG.405 Great progress in the identification of 4-mono-, 9-mono, and 7,9-di-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc) in tissue slices or cells of man and mouse was recently achieved with hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) envelope proteins of nidoviruses (toro- and coronaviruses) and influenza C virus (HEF).406 For this purpose, HE and HEF ectodomains were fused with the C-terminal domain of human IgG1 or of mouse or bovine IgG2a. The authors showed that O-acetylated sialoglycans occur in a species-, organ-, tissue-, and cell-type-specific way, and that their expression is regulated at the level of the individual cell. They also observed that in several key tissues, especially in the brain, mice and humans share similar 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid expression profiles, which suggests an evolutionary and functional conservation. In a similar way, this method with the recombinant soluble virolectins was applied to various tissues of many kinds of animals, including humans, and demonstrated an astonishing variability of the occurrence of the three O-acetylated sialic acids in the tissues studied. While Neu4,5Ac2, for example, was prevalent in horse and guinea pig respiratory tissue, Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu5,7,9Ac3 were found especially in the same tissue of man and mouse.407 In an early study using a monoclonal antibody bound to gold particles against the Meningococci group B capsular polysaccharide, [\u2192 8)Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192]n, this polymer was detected in a human Wilms tumor (Fig. 25\n).408, 409, 410 Treatment with endo-neuraminidase N as control abolished staining. Furthermore, in an immunocytochemical study on ganglioside expression in human breast cancer cells, specific monoclonal antibodies and antimouse IgM or antimouse IgG labeled with Alexa 488 showed the accumulation of gangliosides on the tumor cell surfaces in confocal microscopy.411\n",

            "text": "Finally, at the end of this short overview of the history of histological methods in sialobiology, attention will be paid to some new fluorescence microscopy investigations that allow the manipulation of glycans within their native environment, i.e., to study living cells and the localization, mobility, and lifetime of glycans. Since some sialyltransferases tolerate such large groups as fluorescein at C5 or C9, it was possible to incorporate fluorescent probes via suitably modified CMP-sialic acid donors into cell-surface glycoconjugates412 (for a general review, see ref. 413) or even enabled the kinetic analyses of the rates of different sialyltransferases within cells.414 So, it was possible to localize sialyltransferases in the Golgi compartments in rat liver with the CMP-9-fluoresceinyl-Neu5Ac donor substrate.415 Furthermore, Bertozzi and coworkers introduced the Staudinger ligation for covalent tagging of azido sugars, incorporated biosynthetically into cell-surface glycans. In case of sialic acid, cells are treated with per-O-acetylated N-azidoacetyl-d-mannosamine (ManNAz). After entering the cells, the product is O-deacetylated, transformed into the corresponding N-azidoacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Az), subsequently converted into the activated CMP sugar, and finally incorporated into cell-surface glycans on human or other cells.416 Interestingly, the various biosynthetic enzymes, normally involved in the conversion of ManNAc into bound Neu5Ac (see Section 11.1), tolerate the unnatural substrates. The bound Neu5Az can be visualized using a copper-free click chemistry reaction with, for instance, a difluorinated cyclooctyne (DIFO) reagent, conjugated to an imaging probe, e.g., Alexa Fluor 488. This staining procedure is not toxic and can be carried out in cultured cells and in live mice. Here, a typical example is the study of the sialome during zebrafish development, which showed that the biosynthesis of cell-surface sialosides starts as early as 8.5 h postfertilization.417 In another example, Neu5Az(\u03b12\u21923)Lac or Neu5Az(\u03b12\u21923)Gal was incubated with live trypomastigotes, resulting in Neu5Az(\u03b12\u21923)Gal-glycoconjugates by means of the parasite trans-sialidase (see Section 11.7). For visualization use was made of, for instance, the phosphine\u2013FLAG conjugate, identified by anti-FLAG antibodies. It was learned from this approach that the transfer of sialic acid is mainly to the mucins of the parasites.418\n",

This revolution started with the introduction of fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) in the 1980s. However, today, MALDI-TOFMS and ESIMS play the main roles in carbohydrate analysis (for recent reviews, see refs. 275 and 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610). Even intact glycoproteins can be unraveled now by ESIMS.611 For a series of papers, specifically focused on mass spectrometry of intact sialoglycans, including information about the stabilization of sialic acid, see refs. 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618. For the differentiation between (\u03b12 \u2192 3) and (\u03b12 \u2192 6) linkages several elegant protocols have been developed. For instance, treatment of Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192 \nx)Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 4)-glycans (x\n = 3 or 6) with 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methyl-morpholinium chloride (carboxylic acid activator) in methanol yielded methyl ester derivatives for (\u03b12 \u2192 6)-linked Neu5Ac and lactone derivatives for (\u03b12 \u2192 3)-linked Neu5Ac [Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192 3,1 \u2192 2)Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 and/or Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192 3,1 \u2192 4)Gal(\u03b21 \u2192], providing a difference of 32 Da in mass between both glycosidic linkage types.617 A very recent example comprises the treatment of Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192 \nx)Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 4)-glycans (x\n = 3 or 6) with dimethylamine, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide (activator)/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (catalyst) in dimethyl sulfoxide, affording dimethylamidate derivatives for (\u03b12 \u2192 6)-linked Neu5Ac and lactone derivatives for (\u03b12 \u2192 3)-linked Neu5Ac (difference in mass: 45 Da).619 Subsequent treatment with ammonium hydroxide had only effect on the lactone ring of the (\u03b12 \u2192 3)-linked Neu5Ac, resulting in the formation of an amidate derivative (difference in mass: 28 Da).620\n",

            "text": "As has been described in Section 4.1, first reports on the organic and enzymatic synthesis of Neu5Ac date from the 1960s, in a period that questions around the different chiralities were still not completely solved. The protocols comprised chemical coupling of oxaloacetic acid (or its di-tert-butyl ester) and either d-GlcNAc or d-ManNAc, followed by decarboxylation (Scheme 6),228, 235, 236, 237 and enzymatic coupling of pyruvic acid and d-ManNAc in the presence of Neu5Ac aldolase (N-acylneuraminate pyruvate lyase) (Scheme 5).231, 232 For the preparation of Neu5Gc, d-ManNAc was replaced by d-ManNGc. Next routes to prepare Neu5Ac enzymatically were the condensation of d-ManNAc with phosphoenolpyruvic acid catalyzed by Neu5Ac synthase (rat liver extract) in the presence of ATP, or by Neu5Ac synthase using nonphosphorylated ManNAc (meningococcal extract).239, 621, 622 In the following years, different routes and improvements to obtain higher yields (even at the multikilogram level) were reported.6, 100, 623, 624, 625, 626 In this context, d-ManNAc was frequently generated from the cheaper d-GlcNAc in an alkaline epimerization process. Note that an excellent biological source for the isolation of large amounts of Neu5Ac was initially the urine of sialuria patients (see Sections 8.4 and 13.1),584 and later edible bird's nest mucin153, 548 and hen's egg.627 For the isolation of large amounts of Neu5Gc from holothuroidea gumi, Cucumaria echinata, see ref. 628. With the characterization of a long series of N,O-acylneuraminic acids in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Section 5), synthetic activities in this direction were also started. Via organic synthesis, several free O-acetylated sialic acids became available, e.g., Neu4,5Ac2, Neu5,9Ac2, Neu9Ac5Gc, Neu4,5,9Ac3, and Neu5,7,8,9Ac4.629, 630, 631, 632 Additionally, a large series of N,O-acetylneuraminic acid alkyl/aryl ester \u03b1-alkyl/\u03b1-aryl glycosides were synthesized: Neu4,5Ac2, Neu5,7Ac2, Neu5,8Ac2, Neu5,9Ac2, Neu5,7,8Ac3, Neu5,7,9Ac3, Neu5,8,9Ac3, Neu4,5,9Ac3, Neu4,5,8,9Ac4, and Neu5,7,8,9Ac4.633, 634, 635 Enzymatic protocols using Neu5Ac aldolase were developed for the synthesis of Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu5Ac9Lt.636, 637 A number of other naturally occurring sialic acids have also been synthesized along organic chemical or aldolase-catalyzed routes. Examples are as follows: Neu2en5Ac,638 Neu2en5Gc,75, 638 Neu2en5,9Ac2,56 Neu2en5,7,9Ac3,56 Neu2en9Ac5Gc,56 Neu2en5GcAc,56 Kdn,639, 640, 641 Kdn2en,642 Neu2,7an5Ac,643, 644 Neu5Ac8Me,645 Neu5Ac9P,51 Neu5Ac1,7lactone,646, 647, 648 Neu5Gc1,7lactone,647 and Kdn1,7lactone.647 See also refs. 6 and 252. More recently, a highly efficient, one-pot, three-enzyme system with flexible substrate specificity was developed, whereby sialic acid family members are generated as intermediates from corresponding N,O-acyl-d-mannosamines and O-acyl/O-alkyl-d-mannoses (catalyst: a sialic acid aldolase) in a protocol that leads via CMP-sialic acids (catalyst: a CMP-sialic acid synthetase) to sialic acid-containing glycosides or sialyl(\u03b12 \u2192 3 or \u03b12 \u2192 6)galacto-glycans (catalyst: a bacterial sialyltransferase).649, 650, 651, 652 Reported examples of intermediates comprise Neu5Ac, Neu5,9Ac2, Neu5Ac9Lt, Neu5Gc, Neu9Ac5Gc, Neu5GcAc, Neu5GcMe, Kdn, Kdn5Ac, Kdn5Me, Kdn9Ac, and Kdn5,9Ac2. For the study of biochemical pathways and to understand interactions at the molecular level, isotopically labeled and (stereochemically) modified sialic acids (at C1 and C3 to C9) were also prepared; for reviews, see refs. 6, 106, 108, 252, 626, and 626, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660.",

            "text": "It was soon realized that stereoselective chemical sialylation leading to \u03b1-glycosidic linkages is one of the most difficult glycosylation reactions in carbohydrate chemistry. First, a neighboring participating group is missing to direct the stereochemical outcome of the coupling (C3 is a deoxy group). Second, the coupling reaction takes place at a sterically hindered, tertiary oxocarbenium-ion intermediate. Third, the deoxy moiety in combination with the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group (C1) at the anomeric center (C2) makes sialic acid donors prone to glycal formation. Because it was realized that the availability of labeled sialic acids, sialic acid derivatives, sialic acid O-, N-, C-, and S-glycosides, sialo-analogues, and sialo-oligosaccharides was of the utmost importance for unraveling the secrets of the sialobiology and sialomedicine, the interest in sialochemistry grew enormously. In this context, the creation of a great variety of suitable sialic acid donors and catalysts for organic chemical approaches was developed.6, 107, 137, 660, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672 Furthermore, the progress in the biotechnology of carbohydrate enzymes led also to the generation of suitable amounts of stereoselective sialyltransferases/CMP-Neu5Acyl and trans-sialidases, which made enzymatic approaches attractive.107, 126, 137, 139, 142, 660, 669, 673, 674, 675, 676\n",

Now, from the beginning onward, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry played major roles in their characterization. Since 2017, six subclasses (six isomers) have been identified, namely,(i)5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-non-2-ulosonic acid, called pseudaminic acid (Pse);(ii)5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid, called legionaminic acid (Leg);(iii)5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-talo-non-2-ulosonic acid, called 4-epi-legionaminic acid (4eLeg);(iv)5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid, called 8-epi-legionaminic acid (8eLeg);(v)5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-altro-non-2-ulosonic acid, called acinetaminic acid (Aci); and(vi)5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-l-altro-non-2-ulosonic acid, called 8-epi-acinetaminic acid (8eAci).\n",

As in the case of neuraminic acid, in the full names C7 is the anomeric reference atom. The free sugars exist in the 2\nC\n5 pyranose form as mixtures of \u03b1- and \u03b2-anomers with a predominance of the thermodynamically more stable anomer having an equatorial carboxyl group. Substitutions of the amino groups at C5 and C7 comprise acetyl (Ac), formyl (Fo), (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3RHb), (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3SHb), 4-hydroxybutyryl (4Hb), 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl (3,4Hb), acetimidoyl (Am), N-methyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe), N,N-dimethyl-acetimidoyl (AmMe2), methyl (Me), d-alanyl (Ala), N-acetyl-d-alanyl (AlaNAc), N-methyl-5-glutamyl (GluNMe), l-glyceryl (Gr), and/or 2,3-di-O-methyl-glyceryl (Me2Gr) groups.

This central metabolic pathway provides both fructose-6-phosphate and phosphoenol pyruvate as basic substances for the biosynthesis of sialic acids. The chemical steps involved were primarily elucidated in the laboratories of Roseman734 and Warren.735 It had been shown in the 1950s by several researchers (see, e.g., refs. 736, 737) that radioactive d-glucose is converted into d-glucosamine. Moreover, the precursor of d-glucosamine-6-phosphate was investigated in microorganisms738, 739 and in mammals (rat liver).739, 740 Here, the biosynthetic route comprised an amination of d-fructose-6-phosphate (not d-glucose-6-phosphate) with the amido group of l-glutamine catalyzed by l-glutamine-d-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase), to give d-glucosamine-6-phosphate and l-glutamate.739 The product d-glucosamine-6-phosphate is then acetylated by an N-acetyltransferase, which occurs in many animals and microorganisms, and was first isolated 254-fold from Neurospora crassa.741\n",

It can use both ManNAc and N-glycolylmannosamine (ManNGc). Many years later (1990s), it was shown by the group of Werner Reutter at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin (Germany) that the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc into ManNAc6P is catalyzed by one bifunctional enzyme, the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (GNE)/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (MNK), a crucial step often discussed between Reutter and one of the authors (R.S.). This enzyme, purified from rat liver, both epimerizes UDP-GlcNAc under release of UDP and phosphorylates the resulting ManNAc by its kinase activity.752 In the same study, also feedback inhibition of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase part of the enzyme by CMP-Neu5Ac was demonstrated. In a parallel report, the molecular cloning and functional expression of the GNE/MNK enzyme were published.753 A selective loss of either the epimerase or the kinase activity was established, via site-directed mutagenesis based on sequence alignments. This technique also enabled the localization of the 2-epimerase activity in the N-terminus and the kinase activity in the C-terminus of the protein.754 GNE, the root of which is in the Bilateria, was found to have a complex evolutionary origin.755 It is encoded in the genomes of deuterostomes, acoelomorphs, and Xenoturbella, but is absent in protostomes and nonbilaterians.",

The glycosidic linkage between Neu5Ac and CMP has the \u03b2-configuration.761, 762, 763 The responsible enzyme, CMP-sialic acid synthetase, a pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.43), was first detected in bacteria and purified from N. meningitidis.764 At the same time, it was also found in animal tissues765, 766 and was first purified from pig submandibular glands,767 as reviewed in ref. 768. The enzyme from different sources was found to react with Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and O-acetylated sialic acids, and some of them also with Kdn.6 Remarkably, in contrast to the other sialic acid-synthesizing enzymes, CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase is located in cell nuclei, first observed by Ed Kean769 at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, USA). From the nucleus, CMP-Neu5Ac is transported into the Golgi, using a carrier-mediated transport system to penetrate liver microsomal vesicles (mice studies).770 For the cloning and expression of this CMP-sialic acid transporter, see ref. 771. Kean, who devoted most of his scientific life to the investigation of sialic acid activation, discovered also a CMP-Neu5Ac hydrolase in the plasma membranes of rat liver. Its activity was low in other tissues.772 The role of this hydrolase is still a subject of speculation. Especially in liver, with its most active sialic acid metabolism, the membrane-bound CMP-Neu5Ac hydrolase may regulate the extent of attachment of sialic acid residues to cell membrane glycoconjugates by membrane sialyltransferases.",

In the field of glycolipids, the biosynthesis of GM3 ganglioside was shown from an incubation of lactosyl-ceramide, CMP-[1-14C]Neu5Ac, and a particulate preparation from a 9-day-old embryonic chicken brain.778 In Roseman's laboratory the period between 1963 and 1970 was most fruitful, and the detection of four different sialyltransferases for the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and four different sialyltransferases for the biosynthesis of gangliosides was reported by various coworkers (summarized in refs. 230, 779, and 780). These studies suggested that the different sialyltransferases were responsible for the formation of a variety of sialyl glycosidic linkages. The first purification of a sialyltransferase from bovine colostrum by affinity chromatography on CDP-hexanolamine agarose was achieved by the group of Robert Hill at Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC, USA).780 The specific activity increased 440,000 times when compared with whole colostrum.

In this excellent analysis the architecture of these enzymes, which is similar in all vertebrate sialyltransferases, is discussed. Also the precursor genes for animal sialyltransferases are suggested, e.g., for ST6Gal from insects (Drosophila melanogaster).10 There are also over 25 subfamilies in lower vertebrates, orthologs of the 20 mammalian subfamilies, as well as additional subfamilies in fish genomes.138 For the interesting evolutionary history of the ST8Sia gene family since the early deuterostomes, see ref. 784.

A natural inhibitor was first purified in 1988 from the 100,000 \u00d7 \ng supernatant of a rat-brain homogenate.786 It is a small, heat-stable protein composed of two components of 14.8 and 22.4 kDa, which inhibits brain \u03b12,6-sialyltransferase noncompetitively. Inhibitory activity was also found in brains from other mammals and in nonbrain tissues. A similar, potent inhibitor was isolated from calf brain, which inhibited (95% by 4 \u03bcg of inhibitor) the \u03b12,6-sialyltransferase from ovine submandibular glands.787 Experiments to chemically modify CMP-Neu5Ac in either its nucleotide or sialic acid moiety in order to gain effective sialyltransferase inhibitors were not successful. Instead, cytidine nucleotides inhibited rat liver \u03b12,6-sialyltransferase (\u03b12,6-ST) and porcine submandibular gland \u03b12,3-sialyltransferase (\u03b12,3-ST) well and at similar rates. The K\ni-values of 5\u2032-CMP, 5\u2032-CDP, and 5\u2032-CTP varied between 0.13 and 0.05 mM for \u03b12,6-ST.788 Probably the strongest sialyltransferase inhibitor presently known is 3-fluoroax-N-acetylneuraminic acid (3Fax-Neu5Ac), which is supplied to cells or tissues in per-O-acetylated methyl ester form.789 The hydrophobic molecules penetrate into cells, where they are O-deacetylated. The liberated free 3Fax-Neu5Ac more efficiently inhibits \u03b12,3-sialyltransferases and, consequently, hypersialylation of cancer cells. In vivo, delayed growth of inhibitor-treated melanoma cells was observed.",

The first hint came from studies by Kean.769 The fact that CMP-sialic acid synthetase is located in cell nuclei of various prominent mammalian tissues suggested that this location is an important control mechanism. Furthermore, two feedback inhibition mechanisms of key enzymes of sialic acid synthesis were detected, i.e., (i) UDP-GlcNAc efficiently inhibits the l-glutamine-d-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferases, and (ii) CMP-Neu5Ac inhibits UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (GNE).790 Newer views on the latter enzyme (GNE/MNK) have been discussed in Section 11.1. An example of the lack of the feedback inhibition by CMP-Neu5Ac, required for a physiologically controlled sialic acid metabolism, came from studies of the metabolism of a sialuria patient583 (see Section 13.1). This young patient excreted gram quantities of free Neu5Ac in urine, as well as Neu2en5Ac, 2-acetamidoglucal, ManNAc, and GlcNAc.52, 585 2-Acetamidoglucal represents the putative transition state between UDP-GlcNAc and ManNAc.",

Evidence for the formation of glycolyl-CoA from hydroxypyruvate was demonstrated in porcine liver.803 However, glycolyl-CoA seemed to be a less likely N-glycolyl precursor [only traces of O-glycolylated sialic acids have been detected in bovine and equine submandibular glands (Table 1)]. Furthermore, radioactively labeled 3-hydroxypyruvate and serine were not precursors of (radioactive) Neu5Gc.804 Thus, a transfer of glycolyl groups during Neu5Gc biosynthesis was largely excluded. The following two studies were in agreement with a direct oxidation of the N-acetyl group, as had been (theoretically) proposed 10 years earlier805: (i) direct hydroxylation of N-acetyl anilids to N-glycolyl anilids in liver microsomes806; (ii) oxidation of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid to UDP-N-glycolylmuramic acid before incorporation into the peptide glycan of the bacterial cell wall.807\n",

Incubation of surviving slices of porcine submandibular glands with N-[1-14C]acetyl-glucosamine led to labeling of sialic acids, including Neu5Gc having a radioactive glycolyl group (for analysis of glycolyl groups, see Section 7.1). The direct incorporation of 18O from 18O2 gas, resulting in N-[18O]glycolyl groups in Neu5Gc, was also shown.808 Further incubations with [1-14C]acetate, N-[1-14C]acetyl-mannosamine, and N-[1-14C]acetyl-neuraminic acid led in each case to the identification of N-[1-14C]glycolyl-neuraminic acid.809, 810, 811 All these results led to the claim of the existence of an N-acetylhydroxylase, involved in Neu5Gc biosynthesis. Most of the newly formed, radioactive Neu5Gc was within the tissue still free and not yet incorporated into glycoconjugates. As shown by the group of one of the authors (R.S.), CMP-Neu5Gc (and CMP-Neu5Ac) is formed in porcine submandibular glands and can act as the donor for the transfer of Neu5Gc to nascent glycoproteins by sialyltransferases.812 This led to the assumption that Neu5Gc was formed before the transfer to glycoconjugates in the Golgi.",

In the same years, the group of Akemi Suzuki at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science (Japan) elucidated the complex mechanism of electron transport required for hydroxylase activity, in which NADH, cytochrome b5,817 and cytochrome b5 reductase818 in mouse liver cytosol were involved. This cytochrome b5-dependent electron transport chain is soluble or membrane-bound.819 The enzyme activity can be stimulated by the addition of iron and is inhibited by iron-binding agents, which suggested the existence of an iron-containing prosthetic group.820 Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the primary structure of the hydroxylase revealed that this enzyme is an iron\u2013sulfur protein of the Rieske type (2Fe\u20132S). Interestingly, it was the first example of such an enzyme found in the cytosol in Eukarya.821 The Rieske center is located close to the N-terminus of the enzyme protein. For a first molecular cloning of the CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) gene of mouse liver, see ref. 822. As the CMAH gene is defective in humans, it became clear why Neu5Gc cannot be synthesized in man.823 Finally, the group of Ajit Varki at the University of California (San Diego, USA) discovered that the Rieske sulfur\u2013iron center is missing, which is due to an Alu-mediated inactivation of the human CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase gene.824, 824a\n",

And in a report from 1956, more information about \u201c7-O- and 7,8(9)-O-acetylated N-acetylneuraminic acids\u201d after periodate oxidation studies was provided23, 263 (see Section 5). In the same period, O-acetylated sialic acids were also isolated from bovine mucin by incubation with sialidase (V. cholerae receptor-destroying enzyme)264 (see Section 5). Larger quantities of various O-acetylated sialic acids from bovine submandibular gland were obtained by a combination of anion-exchange and cellulose chromatography.24 The challenges and problems of analyzing O-acetylated sialic acids (Table 1) have already been worked out in Section 5. A turning point in the history of assigning O-acyl substitution patterns was a report from the laboratories of both authors (J.P.K. and R.S.) in 1975, describing the determination of \u201c8-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid\u201d as 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). An unexpected misinterpretation of periodate oxidation data24 was rectified by EIMS27 (see Section 5). And over the years it became clear that Neu5,9Ac2 is the most frequent O-acetylated sialic acid occurring in Nature.",

At pH 5.0 the substance was relatively stable. This migration phenomenon was studied in more detail by 360-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy.38,38a Using the peak intensities of the N-acetyl signals of \u03b1,\u03b2-Neu5,7Ac2 and \u03b1,\u03b2-Neu5,9Ac2, Fig. 29A illustrates the decrease of Neu5,7Ac2 and the increase of Neu5,9Ac2 as a function of the time of incubation in 0.1 M phosphate buffer/D2O (pD 7.2) at 37\u00b0C. In the migration process Neu5,8Ac2 could not be traced as an intermediate. This could mean that a direct intramolecular transfer Ac7 (secondary ester group) \u2192 Ac9 (primary ester group) occurs. But note that so far, an Ac7 \u2192 Ac8 \u2192 Ac9 mechanism has not been excluded. In Fig. 29B a similar plot is depicted for the conversion of Neu5,7,9Ac3 to Neu5,8,9Ac3 (0.1 M phosphate buffer/D2O, pD 7.5), yielding a molar equilibrium of approximately 1:1. A transient distortion of the anti orientation of the functional groups at C7 and C8 seems to be necessary to explain the migration of the O-acetyl group between the two secondary OH groups (see Section 6). For 4-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid no migration of the O-acetyl group was observed.",

When surviving slices of submandibular glands from cow and horse were incubated with [1-14C]acetate at various times at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of oxygen, the radioactivity was almost exclusively incorporated into the O-acetyl groups (and N-acetyl and N-glycolyl groups) of sialic acids within the time of incubation of maximum 4 h.831 Similar to the Neu5Gc synthesis, the highest specific radioactivity of O-acetylated sialic acids was found in the fraction of free sialic acids, followed by that in the microsomal fractions, and the cytosolic sialic acid of the mature glycoproteins, which were least labeled. These findings were interpreted as O-acetylation also occurs before the sialic acid transfer, either at the hexosamine level (which would not be possible for the horse 4-O-acetylated sialic acid) or at the \u201cfree sialic acid\u201d level. In the latter case, free Neu5Ac, Neu5Ac-9-phosphate, or CMP-Neu5Ac were candidates of O-acetyltransferase substrates. Indeed, incubation of homogenates of bovine submandibular gland with N-[1-14C]acetyl-neuraminic acid and acetyl-CoA led to N-[1-14C]acetyl-7- and -8-O-acetylneuraminic acid, as shown by radio-TLC analysis and based on our knowledge of sialic acid derivatives at that time (at the end of the 1960s). Hints for the existence of O-acetylated N-acetylhexosamines were never obtained, and O-acetylation of mature mucin-bound cytosolic sialic acids did not occur.832 Therefore, a systematic name for the enzyme was proposed: \u201cacetyl-CoA:N-acetylneuraminate-7(8)-O-acetyltransferase.\u201d As mentioned earlier, the 8-O-acetyl position was later corrected to be a 9-O-acetyl position, and correspondingly the enzyme was denoted as a 7(9)-O-acetyltransferase (Fig. 30\n). In equine submandibular gland and guinea pig liver, a corresponding acetyl-CoA:sialate-4-O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.44) was detected. Kinetic and other properties of the enzyme were studied in microsomes, prepared from equine submandibular glands, and in an enzyme solubilized from guinea pig liver, respectively.833, 834 In the years that followed, 7(9)-O-acetyltransferase activity was seen in some bacteria and various tissues and cells, ranging from starfish to man.826\n",

Indeed, this was shown to be the case for the CMP-sialate synthetase from bovine submandibular glands, which activates Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, Neu5,7Ac2, and Neu5,8Ac2 (in fact Neu5,9Ac2; see above).835 Sialyltransferases were also shown to be not absolutely strict toward the kind (structure) of activated sialic acid.836 Only in 2007, it was established that CMP-Neu5Ac was the correct substrate for O-acetyltransferase, and CMP-Neu5,7Ac2 was identified as the primary reaction product. Accordingly, the enzyme's name was then modified into AcCoA-CMP-Neu5Ac 7-O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.45).837 Interestingly, ab initio calculations gave information concerning possible roles of the different functional groups occurring on sialic acids.307 Here, the relatively negative charge on the sialic acid side chain O7 supports the hypothesis that in O-acetyltransferase reactions this position is the primary insertion site of the acetyl group, and not the less negative oxygen at C9 (Fig. 30). Afterward, the O-acetyl group migrates to O9, and the participation of a \u201cmigrase\u201d was discussed.838 Before the 2007 Kiel report,837 much effort had been undertaken by the group of Ajit Varki to elucidate the mechanism of sialic acid O-acetylation in rat liver.839, 840 A transmembrane transfer of acetyl groups was observed for which histidine and lysine residues were essential. And it was hypothesized that the O-acetyltransferase activity might be associated within a membrane-bound complex composed of the acetyl-CoA transporter, the O-acetyltransferase, and sialyltransferase activities, and possibly an acetylated intermediate.841 The same group solubilized acetyl-CoA:polysialic acid O-acetyltransferase from K1-positive E. coli and studied its basic properties.842 Unfortunately, it was not possible, in spite of a lot of effort in various laboratories, to isolate and characterize the transferase from this subcellular location, and to get molecular genetic insight on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the enzyme.",

The candidate gene turned out to be CasD1 (capsule structure1 domain containing 1), which is similar to a gene of the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (this yeast contains O-acetylated mannose). Various experiments were described indicating a direct involvement of the human Cas1 including siRNA protein (Cas1p) in the O-acetylation of sialic acids. Expression of this protein and characterization as O-acetyltransferase were achieved more recently.847 CMP-Neu5Ac as substrate of the enzyme was confirmed.",

A recent study on the occurrence of free sialic acids in head and neck cancers of the throat revealed relatively high levels of Kdn (2 \u03bcg/g tissue) when compared with Neu5Ac and also Neu5Gc. Thus, Kdn was discussed to be of prognostic value, as a biomarker, for detecting some early-stage cancers at biopsy.852 The occurrence of Kdn in bacteria was first reported in 1989, namely, in the acidic capsular polysaccharide from Klebsiella ozaenae, which causes respiratory diseases in man.77 Kdn was also detected in trout gangliosides524 and in different organs of the pig, although in smaller amounts than Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc.800\n",

Focusing here on the metabolism (Fig. 28C), a Kdn-9-phosphate synthase, which condenses mannose-6-phosphate and phosphoenol pyruvate to yield Kdn-9-phosphate, was identified in rainbow trout ovaries and in testes. Thus, the biosynthesis of Kdn is similar to that of Neu5Ac, using Man as the hexose precursor instead of ManNAc. After dephosphorylation, the Kdn that is formed can be linked to CMP (CMP-Kdn synthetase853) and transferred to glycans. There exist some enzymes specific for Kdn, including a KDNase (see Section 11.7), but there are also enzymes of the Neu5Ac metabolism that can react with (CMP-)Kdn. For example, a sialyltransferase activity, which catalyzes the transfer of Kdn from CMP-Kdn to the nonreducing termini of the polysialyl chains of polysialoglycoproteins, was found in rainbow trout ovary854 (see Section 8.1). This capping with Kdn of the polysialyl chains prevents their further elongation.",

            "text": "The study of the metabolism and biological functions of sialic acids with hexosamine precursors substituted at the amino group with nonnatural functions, inaugurated by Werner Reutter in a visionary way,859 opened a new area in chemical sialobiology, referred to as metabolic glycoengineering. By the end of the 1960s, Reinhard Brossmer at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr medizinische Forschung (Heidelberg, Germany) had synthesized, among others, N-formyl- and N-succinyl-neuraminic acid and had studied the influence of these foreign substituents on sialidase activity860 (see Section 11.7). At the beginning of the 1980s, the group of Reutter reported that N-propionylglucosamine (GlcNProp) and N-propionylmannosamine (ManNProp) inhibited the Neu5Ac biosynthesis in a cell-free system of rat liver,861 and the formation of N-propionylneuraminic acid (Neu5Prop) was demonstrated. Following these studies, the uptake of N-propionylhexosamines was studied in more detail.862, 863 In rat liver, Neu5Prop biosynthesized from ManNProp was found back in the membrane and serum glycoproteins, as well as in gangliosides. Although some N-acetylmannosamine analogues exhibited a degree of toxicity to cells, with this glycoengineering, various modulations of cell functions became possible. For example, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells could be immunomodulated by the replacement of about 10% of their sialic acids with Neu5Prop, after incubation with ManNProp. The cells proliferated faster, produced more IL-2, upregulated their receptor CD25, and expressed the transferrin receptor.864 Modified sialic acids were found to stimulate the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia cells in the rat central nervous system865 and modulate virus\u2013receptor interactions.866 Growth of diploid human fibroblasts with ManNProp, N-butyrylmannosamine (ManNBut), and N-valerylmannosamine (ManNVar) destroyed their sensitivity to contact inhibition of growth.867\nN-Acyl modification of sialic acids seems to be promising in cancer therapy. Treatment of human neuroblastoma cells with ManNProp or ManNVar reduced their sialylation and metastatic potential and increased their sensitivity toward radiation and chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, ManNPent inhibited polysialylation.868 The formation of cell membrane N-azidoacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Az) after the application of per-O-acetylated N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAz) also offers many possibilities for cell biological, including histochemical (see Section 7.4), experiments.413 Recently, this rapidly growing area of the metabolic glycan labeling strategy was excellently and thoroughly reviewed.869, 870 It reports many more applications than mentioned here, and it summarizes that mannosamines with modified aliphatic N-acyl functions, like ManNProp, can be used for the investigation of Neu5Ac-dependent biological processes. In contrast, mannosamines with bio-orthogonal modified N-acyl groups, like ManNAz, are mainly used to visualize sialylation and sialic acid metabolism in vitro and in vivo.\n",

Although 4-O-acetylated sialic acids are resistant toward the action of the latter enzymes [an exception is the fowl plague virus sialidase (see Section 11.7)], no accumulation of sialoglycoconjugates in corresponding tissues, like in the horse, leading to storage diseases, was observed. A first hint for the existence of a \u201cmissing link\u201d in the catabolism of O-acetylated sialic acids was obtained in the 1980s when the ganglioside Neu4Ac5Gc-GM3, isolated from horse erythrocytes, was incubated with partially purified equine liver sialidase.871 Unexpectedly, non-O-acetylated Neu5Gc was slowly released, which was later explained by the possible presence of a 4-O-acetylesterase activity in the sialidase preparation.872 More recently, two esterases could be isolated from the 100,000 \u00d7 \ng supernatant of horse liver by isoelectric focusing, one O-deacetylating both Neu4,5Ac2 and Neu5,9Ac2, and the other only Neu5,9Ac2.873 Both enzymes were inactive with 7-O-acetylated sialic acids, as was also observed for other sialate esterases.",

For a summary of the enzyme tests available, see ref. 876. The sialate-O-acetylesterase in influenza C virus was one of the first esterases discovered. Although an enzyme destroying the virus receptor had been demonstrated to exist on influenza C viruses in 1950,877 the specificity of this enzyme and the nature of the cellular receptor for this virus have remained puzzling ever since. Then, in the 1980s, it was found that sialic acid is involved in the receptor function for the virus, because sialidase destroyed a potent hemagglutination inhibitor present in rat serum, i.e., \u03b11-macroglobulin.878 The nature of this sialidase-susceptible sialic acid was found to be Neu5,9Ac2, which lost its O-acetyl group by incubation of rat \u03b11-macroglobulin or bovine submandibular gland mucin with influenza C virus.829 This pointed to the presence of an esterase in the virus, which was thereafter isolated and denoted as sialate 9(4)-O-acetylesterase, because it hydrolyzed both Neu4,5Ac2 and Neu5,9Ac2.879 For a further characterization and molecular cloning, see ref. 880. In additional studies, the group of Jos\u00e9 Cabezas at the Universidad de Salamanca (Spain) found that the influenza C virus esterase had broad substrate specificity, hydrolyzing not only natural substrates containing Neu5,9Ac2 (e.g., bovine submandibular gland mucin) but also many nonsialic acid O-acetyl-containing compounds.881 This esterase turned out to be part of the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein complex of influenza C virus, the crystal structure of which has been elucidated in 1998.882 In the same period, the HEF protein complex from mouse hepatitis virus strain S was shown to contain a sialate 4-O-acetylesterase part.883 It should be noted that, due to steric hindrance, all these esterases never can act on sialic acid 7-O-acetyl groups. Therefore, for O-deacetylation, the 7-O-acetyl group must first migrate to position 9 (Fig. 30) in order to get access to the catalytic center of the enzyme.838 In further investigations, the human sialate-9-O-acetylesterase, the gene of which is located on chromosome 11, gained much interest, since it was shown to play a key role in the regulation of B-cell response and the level of O-acetylation in human colon mucosa,884 and to be involved in immune and autoimmune events.885, 886, 887 In a thorough study of the human sialic acid acetylesterase, including a genomic and phylogenetic analysis, the size of the enzyme and its subcellular localization, the composition of the active center, and other properties have been addressed.888 One of the most interesting target molecules of this 9-O-acetylesterase is the ganglioside 9-O-acetylated GD3, which influences a variety of biological functions, from apoptosis to the growth and metastasis of tumor cells.826 Its elevated concentration in a variety of tumors was described.",

In fact, they regulate the lifetimes of soluble serum glycoproteins and cells, have great significance in all aspects of cell biology, and are most prominent in immunology and in disease states such as cancer (for reviews, see refs. 6 and 963). The sialobiology area was greatly stimulated when Ashwell and Morell in 1974 described in a review that desialylated glycoproteins of rabbit blood serum were rapidly cleared from the circulation and taken up by hepatocytes.964 This process was mediated by a galactose-specific receptor on the hepatocytes, which recognized galactose residues of the glycoprotein glycans, demasked by the loss of terminal sialic acids (cleavage of Neu5Ac(\u03b12\u21923/6)Gal linkage). The first report, describing the fate of desialylated serum glycoproteins, is from 1971.965 The properties, molecular biology, and biosynthesis of this Ca2+-dependent (galactose) receptor have been intensively investigated, e.g., see ref. 966.",

The adhesion of asialo-erythrocytes is mediated by lectin-like receptors on Kupffer cells, which recognize the unmasked galactosyl residues.969, 971, 972 Adhesion can be inhibited by glycans that possess galactose in a terminal position. This binding and phagocytosis of sialidase-treated (rat) erythrocytes occurs by a mechanism independent of opsonins.973 Using rat peritoneal macrophages and desialylated rat erythrocytes, the attachment of the erythrocytes to the macrophages and partial phagocytosis could be clearly demonstrated (Fig. 34A).974, 975 The galactose receptor of rat peritoneal macrophages was identified by photoaffinity labeling as a protein of 42 kDa.976 It adds to the rapidly increasing family of lectins recognizing galactose and other sugars, as reviewed in ref. 977.",

Correspondingly, binding studies with sialidase-treated rat lymphocytes and homologous peritoneal macrophages also showed reversible binding to these nucleated cells (in contrast to the erythrocytes), but no phagocytosis (Fig. 34B and C).980, 981 The interaction was inhibited by galactosides, showing the involvement of the galactose receptor. Also in this in vitro experiment the lymphocytes continuously were released from the macrophages within 1 day. This reversible binding may be due to rapid resynthesis of membrane sialic acids, as observed with human lymphocytes982 and with rat liver plasma membranes.983 The turnover rate of sialic acid in a rat liver cell membrane glycoprotein was 33 h, whereas that of the corresponding protein part was 70\u201378 h.983\n",

It functions as an inhibitory \u201cself-signal\u201d to the vertebrate immune system.985 Also in cancer biology, the masking role of sialic acids is of great significance, as will be discussed in Section 12.3.",

The most important feature is the altered, mostly elevated, sialylation of the surface of tumor cells. This is caused by \u03b12,3-, \u03b12,6-, and \u03b12,8-sialyltransferases, which are often more expressed in malignant cells compared to the corresponding normal cells. This high sialylation often leads to accelerated cancer progression including cell\u2013cell repulsion, altered binding of cancer cells to the extracellular matrix, enhanced migration, docking to the vascular endothelium, and invasion that facilitates the formation of metastases and leads to poor prognosis of the disease. An elevated expression of the selectin ligands SLea and SLex in a variety of tumor types has been observed. Higher sialylation increases the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis. Some tumors also exhibit more Neu5Gc and changes in sialic acid O-acetylation or Kdn concentration in comparison to the normal tissues.",

            "text": "The year 1956 may be considered as the beginning of tumor sialoglycobiology, when Ambrose and coworkers discovered that tumor cells from hamster kidneys have a much greater electrophoretic mobility than normal homologous kidney cells.1000 In addition, mouse sarcoma cells migrated faster on electrophoresis when they acquired more malignant properties.1001 At that time, the nature of the molecules responsible for the electrophoretic mobility was not yet known. However, treatment of erythrocytes, as a model, with trypsin released a \u201csialomucopeptide\u201d which contained terminally linked sialic acids. This was the first demonstration of a sialoglycopeptide at the periphery of a cell.960 The existence of sialylated carbohydrates on the surface of normal and malignant mammalian cells was nicely demonstrated by using a Hale staining technique and comparison with sialidase treatment.1002 Most interesting experiments were carried out by the groups of Leonard Warren and Mary C. Glick in the beginning of the 1970s, when they demonstrated a marked difference in cell-surface glycosylation/sialylation of normal and virus-transformed baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells by a double-label technique with [14C]- or [3H]-l-fucose. The radioactive pronase-released glycoproteins from the two cell types were mixed and fractionated on Sephadex G-50. The eluting radioactive glycopeptides of both biological sources showed different profiles.1003, 1004 In a publicaton1004 by Warren and coworkers, an elevated (up to 11 times) sialyltransferase activity in the transformed BHK cells, when compared to the normal cells, was reported; the sialic acid content was much higher in the transformed cells. Also invasive tumors of human breast and colon expressed elevated levels of glycoprotein sialyltransferases.1005 Since then, by using various techniques, increased sialylation and altered glycosylation have been observed in many tumors, mostly derived from ectodermal tissues, for example, in the most prevalent breast and colon cancers. A wealth of information about tumor biology was obtained in the early days of this research from the study of blood serum from tumor patients; an increase of sialic acids during tumor growth in humans and mice was identified.1006, 1007, 1008 The increase of serum sialic acid was later recognized to be due to high levels of sialylation of both glycoproteins and glycolipids.1009 In the case of \u03b2-myeloma proteins, three to six times more sialic acid was found in blood serum.1010\n",

Probably the first observation of higher lysosomal sialidase and lower cytosolic sialidase levels was made in rat hepatomas, when compared to that of normal liver.1011 More recently, human sialidase was established to be a cancer marker, which is downregulated in lysosomes, promoting the growth and metastatic ability of tumor cells. The enzyme is upregulated in the plasma membrane, which suppresses apoptosis of cancer cells.1012 As described in Section 11.7, the human sialidases NEU1\u2013NEU4 are expressed differently in various tumor tissues.928 In general, transformed cell lines express higher activities of membrane-bound sialidase that preferably desialylates gangliosides.1013 Furthermore, the SLex epitope, which is often more expressed on tumor cells and interacts with selectins, facilitates metastasis (see below). Its biosynthesis has been studied in human lung carcinoma cells.1014\n",

A well-studied example are human colon cells, the mucin of which is highly O-acetylated in the healthy state. On tumor development, in the adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence, mucin O-acetylation gradually decreased with the lowest value in adenocarcinoma. This leads to a higher concentration of SLex in mucins, which had been masked before by O-acetylation in the metastatic cells, thus facilitating metastasis.1015 The O-acetyltransferase activity declined, also.1016 Another example are melanoma and basalioma tissues in which gangliosides with O-acetylated sialic acids, mostly 9-O-Ac-GD3, are much more expressed than in normal skin.1017 For example, in gangliosides from basalioma, up to 56 times higher concentration of Neu5,9Ac2 was determined. O-Acetylated gangliosides, which also occur in other tumors of neuroectodermal origin, represent markers for neoplastic development. Interestingly, they are also universal markers for rapidly growing normal cells and tissues. In spinalioma (squamous cell carcinoma) and in skin nevi, sialic acid O-acetylation was not increased (J. Gierthm\u00fchlen and R. Schauer, unpublished results). A ganglioside containing sialylated lacto-N-fucopentaose II turned out to be an antigen associated with human gastrointestinal cancer cells.1018 During the last 30 years, more knowledge about gangliosides has been gathered, especially about the signaling mechanisms, particularly in cancer cells, regulated by these sialoglycolipids. Antitumor therapy addressing these molecules has been gradually put into practice.1019\n",

Elevated levels of Neu5Gc were described as chemical or tumor-associated markers in glycolipids of human breast carcinoma and other tumors and in avian lymphoma cell lines.1020, 1021, 1022 They are called Hanganutziu\u2013Deicher (HD) antigens (see Section 12.4). HD antigens occur in blood serum in rather variable amounts from normal individuals to cancer patients, where the values are often increased. With regard to the origin of Neu5Gc, a dietary source is assumed, as was first studied with rats.1023 Tumor cells may be able to take up more exogenous Neu5Gc than normal cells. There is also some evidence, which, however, needs more solidification, that small amounts of Neu5Gc can also be produced in an endogeneous metabolic pathway (H.-G. Hanisch, personal communication). Hydroxylase activity was, however, never observed. Finally, an important aspect of the xenoantigen Neu5Gc is its immunological and inflammatory role. There is evidence that these processes may lead to malignancies.1024\n",

            "text": "In this section some historical aspects of sialic acids playing a role in immunology will be summarized. The beginning of the classical immunology goes back to 1900, when Landsteiner discovered the ABO blood group system.1025 For a review, see ref. 1026. The system was originally defined in terms of the antigenic substances occurring at the surface of red blood cells. At that time the carbohydrate nature of the antigens was not yet known. In the following years, more than 100 red cell antigens were analyzed including the Lewis system and the M and N antigens.1026, 1027, 1028 The largest group of these glycans are human erythrocyte autoantigens that react with the corresponding antibodies. They can also occur on cells of human tissues and in animals. The antibodies are monoclonal in patients with chronic lymphoproliferation. The cold agglutinins mainly react with erythrocytes, best at 0\u00b0C. This can lead via complement activation to intravasal erythrocyte degradation, which leads to anemia. The antigens corresponding with the monoclonal anti-Gd, -Fl, -Li, -Lud, -Pr, -Sa, -Ss, and -Vo are sialylated and can be inactivated by sialidase. As an example, the abbreviation Gd means \u201cganglioside-dependent.\u201d Gangliosides with Neu5Gc are Gd-inactive. Sialic acids, linked (\u03b12 \u2192 3) or (\u03b12 \u2192 6) at the glycophorin glycans, can also influence the Pr antigen specificity.1029 For comprehensive reviews about this complex topic, see refs. 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034.",

This and the early studies of the biosynthesis of blood group substances are thoroughly described in ref. 1026. Regarding the glycosylation of immunoglobulins, as early as 1934 covalently linked carbohydrates were reported to occur on serum proteins with high antitoxin titer after immunizing horses against diphtheria toxin.1038 For a review, see ref. 1039. But it was until 1967 that sialic acid was described to be present in human IgG.1040 The variable sialic acid content altered the electrophoretic mobility of this immunoglobulin. In one of the first attempts to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of human \u03b3G1, four possible ways of joining the Fab region to a nearby Fc region were shown.1041\n",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies against O-acetylated sialic acids in human colon mucins were obtained by immunization of BALB/c mice with mucosal scrapings from normal human large intestine. Antibody PR.3A51052 and antibody 6G41053 bound to O-acetylated mucin and were useful in studying the histochemistry of the normal colon, colon cancer, and ulcerative colitis. Immunization of mice with highly purified human colonic mucin afforded the monoclonal antibody MMM-17, which strongly binds to the mucin of goblet cells of the normal colon, but not to those of colon cancer tissue.1054 Saponification of the O-acetyl groups in the mucin or sialidase treatment of the mucin abolished the binding. O-Acetylated gangliosides are also immunogenic, as was studied with GD3 and GD3 derivatives. Here, monoclonal antibodies were obtained that distinguish between GD3 (CD 60a), 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (CD 60b), and 7-O-acetyl-GD3 (CD 60c).1055 It was found in many investigations that the disialoganglioside GD3 is the most frequent carrier of terminal O-acetylated sialic acid. The occurrence and the roles known of O-acetylated GD3 have been reviewed826 (see also Section 11.5.2). Among the most striking and influential effects of O-acetylation are the inhibition of apoptosis of tumor cells,1056 the inhibition of the interaction of the siglec sialoadhesin with 9-O-acetylated sialic acid ligands, and the inhibition of the binding of human complement factor H, a negative regulator of the alternative complement pathway, to sialic acids.1057, 1058 Thus, a decrease of O-acetylation may help tumor cells to escape from complement-mediated lysis. A classical example of the protective effect of (unsubstituted) sialic acids from activation of the lytical alternative complement pathway is the channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus. Very little bactericidal activity is exerted by the alternative complement pathway against the fish pathogens containing sialic acids, in contrast to a strong response against the nonpathogenic bacteria that lack sialic acid. This phenomenon is sialidase sensitive.1059\n",

            "text": "The previous examples have shown that sialic acids are involved in antigenic structures. To these also belong the so-called differentiation and oncodevelopmental antigens of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are expressed during ontogenesis and also in cancer.987 However, sialic acids often mask antigenic sites on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and carbohydrate oligo- and polymers and thus represent \u201cantiantigens.\u201d Thus, these monosaccharides have a remarkable regulatory role in immunology (see, e.g., refs. 963 and 1065), in a similar way as already discussed for the regulation of the lifetime of blood components and cells, namely, via a dual \u201cself/nonself\u201d system (see Section 12.2). So, the masking effect of sialic acids renders molecules and cells as \u201cself.\u201d After the loss of the sialic acid residues, the structures become \u201cnonself\u201d and may be recognized by the immune system, which may lead to autoimmune diseases. A masking role of sialic acids has early been detected for porcine submandibular gland glycoproteins. Sialidase treatment of these mucins revealed H blood group activity, because Neu5Gc had stereospecifically masked the H-determinant Fuc(\u03b11 \u2192 2).1066 A classical example is also the masking of the T-antigen Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 3)GalNAc(\u03b11 \u2192 O)Ser/Thr and the Tn-antigen GalNAc(\u03b11 \u2192 O)Ser/Thr of blood cells and some tumors by Neu5Ac in humans.1032 The Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 4)[Fuc(\u03b11 \u2192 3)]GlcNAc antigen was also found to be cryptic in different human tissues.1067 It is masked to a variable extent by Neu5Ac at the terminal Gal residue of the antigen {Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192 3)Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 4)[Fuc(\u03b11 \u2192 3)]GlcNAc} or at adjacent carbohydrate chains (obscuring the antigen by steric hindrance) and can be made visible by histochemical means by using sialidase. One of the most striking and important examples for the masking of antigenic sites is the immunobarrier between mother and fetus due to the expression of highly sialylated glycoconjugates on syncytiotrophoblast cells.1068, 1069 These molecules prevent the formation of antibodies by the maternal organism against fetal cells. Loss of sialic acids in kidney, e.g., by viral or bacterial infection, may lead to immunological injuries of the glomeruli leading to chronic glomerulonephritis.1070 Note that tissues rich in sialic acids tend to develop autoimmune diseases.963 The pronounced masking of tumor antigens by sialic acids has already been discussed in Section 12.3. These observations, together with an old report1071 about the effect of sialidase to increase the immunogenicity of the Landsch\u00fctz ascites tumor cells, stimulated attempts to cure cancer by sialidase treatment of tumor cells, reinjection of the cells, and thus vaccination of the patient with these cells.963 Injection of the cells into various places of the skin (\u201cchessboard vaccination\u201d) had been recommended. This method was successful in the treatment of dog mammary tumors,1072 while in humans the duration of the remission was extended in myelocytic or lymphatic leukemia.1073 Although some positive results were obtained, this method was not followed further.",

This lectin also agglutinates erythrocytes and preferably binds to sialylated O-glycans of mucins. These lectins of the phylogenetically very ancient horseshoe crabs are considered as potent innate defense systems against parasites with sialic acids or perhaps similar nonulosonic acids.",

Influenza virus hemagglutination was found to be inhibited by a brain lipid fraction, known to contain gangliosides.1093 In the following decades the structure and pathophysiological significance of the viral hemagglutinin (designated \u201cH\u201d antigen) was most intensively studied, until today, by the group of Hans-Dieter Klenk at Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg (Germany).958, 959, 1094 Influenza viruses demonstrate pronounced receptor binding specificity. Human influenza viruses preferentially bind to Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192 6)Gal sequences, whereas avian influenza viruses prefer Neu5Ac(\u03b12 \u2192 3)Gal as ligand (or receptor in the terminology of virologists).1095 Competitive inhibitors of the binding of avian or human influenza viruses to sialylated glycans are soluble glycoconjugates carrying (\u03b12 \u2192 3)- or (\u03b12 \u2192 6)-linked sialic acids, respectively. The earlier discussed mucin from the nests of the Chinese swiftlet, genus Aerodramus collocalia (collocalia mucoid, edible bird's nest substance),1096 rich in sialic acids, is a potent inhibitor of the agglutination of myxoviruses.1097 This may have been the reason that it has been used in Chinese medicine for hundreds of years in order to prevent and cure influenza and its following bronchial diseases. The substance, which is a good substrate for sialidase, has additional health benefits and is therefore highly esteemed in Asia.1098\n",

Heinrich (Karl Wilhelm) Schade from the same university also observed about 40 years later the extravasation of white blood cells into inflamed tissues. He assumed that substances penetrating into the blood make the leukocytes \u201csticky\u201d resulting in adhesion of the cells to the wall of the blood vessels before they extravasate into the tissue guided by chemotaxis.1111 The molecular basis of these events could not be elucidated in those times. Heinrich Schade is considered the father of molecular pathology, a new area of medical research, in completion with the then existing cellular pathology.",

Electron microscopic studies showed that microvascular structures exist in the lymph nodes, consisting of plump, cuboidal endothelial cells, known as high endothelial venules (HEV),1112 and lymphocyte adherence to HEV could be demonstrated.1113 Further studies on the leukocyte extravasation at sites of inflammation showed a dynamic process.1114 After 2 h of injury, postcapillary venules displayed adhesive properties that supported leukocyte binding, followed by endothelial transmigration. At this state of the research, it was not known that carbohydrates were involved in leukocyte extravasation, but soon after these reports the participation of carbohydrates in lymphocyte trafficking was recognized.978 In many further studies, the HEV receptor of the lymphocytes was shown to be a lectin, whereby sialylated glycans on HEV serve as ligand for this lectin.1115, 1116 Furthermore, a family of sulfated sialofucosylated glycoproteins (sulfated at position 6 of GlcNAc or Gal of SLex) was found which serve as L-selectin ligands on HEV, known as \u201cperipheral lymph node addressins.\u201d1117 While L-selectin is expressed on lymphocytes, and functions in the migration of these cells to lymphoid organs, E- and P-selectins are expressed on vascular endothelial cells and mediate the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation in tissues (Fig. 36\n). P-Selectin also occurs on lymphocytes. E-Selectin is constitutively expressed on bone marrow microvessels, and human hematopoietic stem cells express high amounts of an E-/L-selectin ligand.1110 The involvement of selectins in cancer metastasis has drawn many researchers to this field.1118\n",

The adhesion mediates interactions with developing myeloid cells in the bone marrow1125 and lymphocytes in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes.1127 Recent research has shown that adhesion is also involved both in clearance of sialylated human pathogens and in antigen presentation.1123\n",

Aberrant O-acetylation of sialic acids, caused by the enzyme pair O-acetyltransferase and -esterase, is thought to be involved in autoimmune diseases like asthma.885 Furthermore, mouse and human Sn prefer Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc. However, murine CD22 strongly prefers Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac, but human CD22, as well as CD33, siglec-5 and siglec-6 accept both types of sialic acids. It can be assumed that these human-specific changes are due to the dramatic alteration in the human \u201csialome\u201d after the CMAH mutation and Neu5Gc loss.133, 133a\nMany of these binding studies with differently linked sialic acids and natural or chemically modified sialic acid derivatives, e.g., Neu5Gc and Neu5,9Ac2, which much helped to understand the biology of siglecs, were, in the beginning of siglec research, based on a close cooperation between Paul Crocker, Jim Paulson, and S\u00f8rge Kelm.

This helped research on this topic, since Neu5Ac was very expensive at that time, and scientists were interested in a commercial source of the compound. As said in Section 11.4, the underlying metabolic defect in sialuria is the loss of feedback inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis, i.e., UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase (GNE), by CMP-Neu5Ac. This leads to enhanced enzyme activity and accumulation of Neu5Ac in sialuria fibroblasts.586, 1143 Also the mutations in the epimerase gene have been analyzed.1142 Sialuria is a very rare disease. The French patient, suffering from sialuria, remained unique for a long time, but other cases, also without lysosomal involvement, but with lower excretion of sialic acids, have been described later.568 Sialuria patients show mild mental retardation, seizures, and slightly dysmorphic features.",

So far, about 150 cases have been reported.1141, 1145 The name \u201cSalla\u201d is derived from a Northern area in Finland from where most of the patients originated. However, two patients with Salla disease were also detected in Turkey.1146 A similar, but more severe disease than Salla disease, with a much earlier onset, often occurring at birth, was described in 1982 in an infant of German\u2013Swedish origin, and it was called Infantile Sialic Acid Storage Disease (ISSD).1147 Such patients are, rarely, found in several continents. The pathomechanism of these diseases is an impaired transport of free Neu5Ac across the lysosomal membrane.1148 The reason for the Neu5Ac accumulation in the lysosomes of various tissues is a defective H+-driven transport of sialic acid (and d-glucuronic acid) through the lysosomal membrane by a mutation of the integral lysosomal protein Sialin.1142, 1149\n",

As reviewed in Section 8.4, excessive quantities of sialyloligosaccharides (sialic acid = Neu5Ac), derived from glycoprotein N- and O-glycans, were found in body fluids and urine. Fibroblasts of the patients exhibit a sialidase defect and accumulate abnormal amounts of sialic acid-containing substances. Besides this group of dysmorphic children with early beginning of the disease, there is a milder type of sialidosis with normal physical appearance of the patients, absent or mild mental retardation, and onset only in adolescence. These patients also have impaired sialidase activity and excrete unusual amounts of sialyloligosaccharides.1154 These two groups are categorized as type I and type II sialidosis, respectively. In summary, sialidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, affecting the degradation of glycoproteins. It is caused by a genetic defect of the lysosomal sialidase (Neu 1) gene, first cloned in 1996.1155 Several mutations are known, which lead to different expressions of the phenotype of this disease.1156, 1157\n",

            "text": "Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) encompasses several syndromes with autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance, and the patients suffer from a progressive course of muscle weakness leading to severe disability. In 2011 about 500 patients with HIBM were known worldwide.1163 The most common form is the quadriceps muscle-sparing autosomal recessive myopathy,1164 which was originally described in patients of Persian\u2013Jewish heritage.1165 The muscle problems usually start in the second to third decade of life with weakness and atrophy of distal lower limb muscles that eventually spreads proximally. The reason for this disease is a reduced activity of the key enzyme UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE/MNK) (see Section 11.1), which leads to impaired Neu5Ac biosynthesis, and to rimmed vacuoles and Congo-Red-positive depositions in fibers in the muscles. So far, 154 mutations have been identified in the gene of GNE that are likely leading to reduced GNE enzyme activities.1166 It was shown that mutation of methionine 743 to threonine in GNE leads to 30% reduction of enzyme activity and to an aggressive form of GNE myopathy. The introduction of threonine offers an additional phosphorylation/O-GlcNAcylation site. Indeed, the O-GlcNAcylation of the M743T GNE variant was increased. Removal of that residue resulted in almost normal GNE activity. Hereby, the balance of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation is decisively involved in regulation and efficiency of GNE. Evidence is accumulating, especially from experiments with mice, that hyposialylation is underlying the molecular mechanism of this muscle weakness.1167, 1168 Also in humans, a considerable lack of free sialic acids in muscle biopsies of patients, when compared to healthy individuals, has been described.1169 It was stated that the lack of sialic acids in GNE myopathy contributes to ROS production/oxidative stress followed by muscle weakness and atrophy.1168 Correspondingly, application of antioxidants had a curative effect.1168, 1170 Furthermore, oral administration to mice of Neu5Ac, sialyllactose, ManNAc, and especially per-O-acetylated ManNAc also decreased the disease symptoms.1170 In man, intravenous application of high doses of highly sialylated immunoglobulin G (IVIG) also improved the disease symptoms.1171\n",

Most impressive was to follow the efforts of those early pioneers to identify the correct structure of the N-acylneuraminic acid molecule. To achieve this goal the often cooperative work of dedicated scientists during several decades was necessary, and they had to cope with erroneous conclusions. After the isolation of sialic acids with still unknown structure from bovine submandibular gland mucin, it was by pure chance that a similar substance was discovered by studies with influenza viruses, and that years later also the analysis of the product of a lyase reaction played an important role in solving the stereochemistry of the sialic acid structure. Another difficult and lengthy effort was the development of reliable techniques for the identification of sialic acids and their many derivatives in natural sources, and chemists, synthesizing, for example, sialic acid glycosides, encountered challenges by these compounds that exceeded those experienced from working with \u201cordinary\u201d sugars.",

Sialic acids are prominent molecules on the cell surface, on the glycocalyx, not only in position but also in function, and they can be considered as cytoprotectors. However, in this position, they are often attacked and conquered by pathogens, especially viruses, and they can also be misused by malignant cells. We highlighted the beginnings and discussed the following inquiries into the pathobiochemical functions of sialic acids. The increasing number of publications on this topic shows that in laboratories all over the world efforts are continuing to gather more information and to employ this knowledge, for example, to develop effective therapies for various diseases.",
