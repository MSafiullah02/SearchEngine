Veterinarians may be able to act on behalf of owners in acquiring an exception under an exotic pet ordinance, but this should first include a frank discussion regarding the potential consequences if a petition is not successful. Furthermore, some state veterinary practice acts prohibit veterinarians from providing care for illegal pets and may require reporting of such by a veterinarian. Owners need to be advised that an illegal carnivore that bites a visitor to a home will face an unfortunate end should the bite be reported, regardless of vaccination status.",

Their curiosity level, combined with a small, flexible, tubular-shaped body, enables them to both gain access to and escape from areas that pose little to no concern with many other pet species. They, therefore, should be housed in a secure, appropriate cage or enclosure and should only be allowed to roam outside the enclosure in a ferret-proofed area while under close supervision. Ferrets are especially fond of crawling into furniture and piles of laundry and seem to have a predilection for soft rubber items.1, 3 The author has treated many cases of \u201cferret versus recliner,\u201d clothes dryer\u2013associated heatstroke, and television remote button ingestion.

Additionally, some high-end feline diets seem to work well for some ferrets. In short, there is no one perfect formulated diet that can be recommended universally and owners need to be advised that they may have to do some experimenting to find which works best for their individual ferrets.2, 4 The author advises clients to find 2 to 4 brands with the appropriate composition of protein and fat and feed in combination. Because ferrets experience olfactory imprinting, it is wise to expose young ferrets to various foods early. Additionally, with the recent trend in frequent pet food recalls, this ensures that ferrets are not subjected to sudden diet changes if one of the main dietary components becomes unavailable.",

Because this disease is considered universally fatal in ferrets, vaccination for CDV should be considered every bit as important as rabies vaccination.4 Choosing a vaccine in this case is not as easy. Various multivalent canine vaccine products were used successfully prior to the introduction of ferret-licensed monovalent vaccines. A safe and effective vaccine has been on the market for ferrets for years,12 but availability from the manufacturer has become inconsistent recently and, at the time of this writing, the product has been on long-term back order. It is suspected that it may not be returning to the market and veterinarians again forced to choose from available canine products for off-label use. Although some practitioners choose not to vaccinate in the absence of a labeled product, the deadly nature of this disease necessitates that owners be involved in a discussion of all options available. If an owner elects to vaccinate with an off-label product, a vaccine with the fewest components should be chosen. Distemper/parvovirus combination vaccines are generally used by most clinicians. If owners choose to forego vaccination, they need to be advised to avoid any possible source of exposure\u2014these include allowing ferrets outdoors with access to the ground; bringing any new dogs into the household; and walking in the house with shoes on after having visited a shelter, dog park, or other area frequented by a higher than average number of dogs of undetermined vaccination status. Vaccinated household dogs can bring the virus in on their feet as well. The myriad sources of exposure is generally sufficient to convince an owner that it is a wiser choice to vaccinate.",

Prior to emergence of deslorelin implants, leuprolide acetate was under investigation for preventive use.20, 21 With the availability of deslorelin implants, potential prevention becomes a more convenient and economical option.9 Investigation regarding the true efficacy of this practice is still in the early stages, but the general consensus is that it is currently appropriate to use these implants for preventive purposes. Owners may initially balk at the expense of placing an implant so closely after the series of first year vaccinations (which are often a surprise to new owners because many pet stores fail to disclose that young ferrets have only received the first in a series of at least 2, but more likely 3, CDV). For those owners receptive to this option, implants ideally should be placed in December or January of a male ferret's first year and in January or February of a female ferret's. Insufficient data exist at this time to suggest a definitive interval for replacement, although the labeled usage for therapeutic use is for 1 year.

This is compelling evidence that there may be a hereditary factor.22 It is too soon, however, to rule out diet as a factor and a combination of the 2 may prove causative.
