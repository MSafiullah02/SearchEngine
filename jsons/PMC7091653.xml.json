After entry into a host cell the genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into dsDNA, which is integrated into the host chromosomal DNA. Newly synthesized unspliced genome-length and spliced subgenomic viral RNAs are possible targets for RNAi in the cytoplasm. It has recently been reported that HIV-1 encodes a suppressor of RNAi, the Tat protein, indicating that HIV-1 replication is controlled by RNAi in human cells.12 Due to its sequence specificity, RNAi is a potentially powerful and selective method for intracellular immunization against HIV-1 infection. RNA interference-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication has been accomplished by synthetic siRNAs in a transient manner13, 14, 15, 16 and by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expression vectors in stably transfected cells.17, 18, 19 Despite potent inhibition, the use of siRNA/shRNA as a therapeutic antiviral is limited, because of the rapid emergence of HIV-1 escape mutants.19, 20, 21 Minor sequence changes in the target sequence, sometimes even a single point mutation, are sufficient to abrogate the inhibition of virus replication. Strategies to reduce the chance of viral escape include the simultaneous use of multiple siRNAs22, 23 or the use of long-hairpin RNA (lhRNA, a single-hairpin molecule) or long dsRNA (two complementary molecules that form a duplex).16, 24 Another possibility is the use of miRNA-based approaches, which do not require perfect sequence complementarity.25, 26",

Transfection of pre-implantation mouse embryo cells, undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and embryonic carcinoma cells with in vitro synthesized long dsRNA confers specific gene silencing.27, 28 However, exposure of non-embryonic mammalian cells to dsRNAs longer than 30 basepairs (bp) leads to rapid induction of a specific set of cytokines, including the class I interferons (IFNs).29 During natural virus infections, the IFN response is activated by virus-produced dsRNAs, and acts as an innate defense mechanism. Viruses counter this response by encoding IFN antagonists, which are also responsible for the fact that antiviral IFN therapy is often not successful.30, 31 So far, virus-encoded RNAi suppressor factors, like the HIV-1 Tat protein, do not appear to be able to suppress induced antiviral RNAi. Strong induction of RNAi by intracellular expression of virus-specific dsRNAs is likely to outcompete the inhibiting effects of RNAi suppressors.",

In order to increase the efficacy of the lhRNA molecules, we cloned the HIV-1 leader sequence (\u03a8) between the LTR and nef1 in pLTR\u03a8-nef1 (Figure 3). Control plasmid pLTRas\u03a8-nef1 was made with the \u03a8 element inserted in antisense orientation. Previously, we reported that sequences from the 5\u2032 untranslated leader of the HIV-1 genome, such as the RNA dimerization signal, can be used to inhibit HIV expression in trans.53 We presumed that \u03a8 should bring the antiviral RNA along viral pathways, conferring a stronger inhibitory effect. Indeed, in HEK 293T cells transfected with pLAI and pLTR\u03a8-nef1, HIV-1 production was almost completely inhibited (Figure 5a). The level of inhibition conferred by pLTR\u03a8-nef1 is comparable to that of the positive control sh-nef. Inhibition is specific and not due to a more general cell toxicity problem because no significant decrease in RL expression was observed (results not shown). Control plasmid pLTRas\u03a8-nef1 was much less effective in inhibiting HIV-1 production, with a potency comparable to that of the original pLTR-nef1 construct. Plasmid pLTR\u03a8, in which the nef1 sequence has been deleted, failed to inhibit HIV-1 production (Figure 5b). This result indicates that the presence of the \u03a8 element enhances lh-nef1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1, but the presence of the nef1 sequence is essential for the potent effect of pLTR\u03a8-nef1.",

In order to test whether there is a difference between the RNAi-inducing capacity of dsRNAs produced in the nucleus or cytoplasm of cells, we expressed dsRNA targeted to the nef-coding domain (nef2 in Figure 1) using the cytoplasmic T7 RNA polymerase system. To generate pT7-nef2, we cloned a 300 bp nef-specific DNA fragment between convergent T7 promoters and terminators (Figure 3). In addition, the control expression plasmid pT7sh-nef was constructed. Cytoplasmic transcription of pT7-nef2 and pT7sh-nef is performed by T7-polymerase encoded by pT7-pol. Expression of the firefly luciferase (FL) reporter from the T7 promoter (pT7-luc) was measured as a positive control in all transfection experiments with pT7-pol (Figure 6a). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with pLAI and pT7-nef2 or pT7sh-nef, with and without pT7-pol. Virus production was measured in the culture supernatant 3 days after transfection by CA-p24 ELISA. In the absence of T7-polymerase, pT7-nef2 and pT7sh-nef confer a low level of inhibition on virus production probably due to leaky RNA expression from the plasmids (Figure 6b). With T7-polymerase, pT7-nef2 and pT7sh-nef confer up to 90% inhibition of HIV-1 production (Figure 6b). This level of inhibition is comparable to that obtained with the sh-nef control expression plasmid. Renilla luciferase expression was not affected (Figure 6b, gray bars). To demonstrate that the effect of pT7-nef2 is sequence-specific, we cotransfected it with the pGL3-Nef reporter (Figure 6c). In the presence of T7-polymerase, pT7-nef2 potently inhibited luciferase expression.",

Similar to the combined use of antivirals in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), one could design an RNAi therapy with extended lhRNA/dsRNA. Endogenous expression of two long complementary RNAs, with the potential to form an extended dsRNA duplex, leads to specific suppression of gene expression in mammalian cells.32, 34, 35, 37 Interestingly, full-length dsRNAs could not be detected, suggesting that processing by Dicer precludes their accumulation in the cytoplasm. Long dsRNAs are indeed processed in vitro by the RNAi machinery into multiple active siRNAs.55, 56 Several lines of evidence show that lhRNAs induce gene silencing by the RNAi mechanism. Inhibition of Dicer abrogated the gene silencing induced by lhRNA against GFP, indicating that silencing was mediated by RNAi.32 These results suggest that long dsRNA is well tolerated in mammalian cells, most likely because it is processed rapidly by the RNAi machinery. It is also relevant to mention that mammalian cells may naturally produce dsRNA derived from repetitive and transposable elements.57, 58 A recently performed bioinformatics study revealed the presence of at least 4520 full-length transcripts, which form sense\u2013antisense gene pairs in the human genome.59",

The most active constructs either link the lhRNA to viral RNA sequences (\u03a8) or express the long dsRNA directly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that translocation of dsRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is a crucial step for these molecules to enter the cytoplasmic RNAi pathway. It is widely accepted that RNAi is a cytoplasmic process, as most protein components of the RNAi pathway, including Argonaute 2, TRBP and Dicer, assemble and function in the cytoplasm.54, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 Putative problems in nuclear export of lhRNA may thus hamper its inhibitory activity. Modification of the lhRNA by addition of the HIV-1 leader sequence (\u03a8) or direct cytoplasmic expression of long dsRNA by the T7 polymerase created potent inhibitors. The viral \u03a8 sequence may provide the transcript with a non-self signature and thereby boost RNAi. It has previously been suggested that the inhibitory effect of \u03a8-containing transcripts is sequence-specific, possibly due to premature formation of RNA dimers,53 but the exact mechanism of inhibition remains to be elucidated.",
