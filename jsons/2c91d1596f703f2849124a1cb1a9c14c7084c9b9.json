            "text": "2001. It has been reported that HMPV was responsible for approximately 5-10% of 188 hospitalizations of children suffering from ARI, 14 which has led to considerable clinical 189 and economic burden worldwide. HMPV detection rates vary according to geographic 190 location, and the incidence of HMPV may show seasonal or annual patterns in the 191 same area. In previous studies, 21330 the HMPV detection rate was approximately 192 1-17% of ARI. In this 33year study, 103 of 5133 (2.0%) patients were positive for 193 HMPV, which is similar to previous reports of HMPV in patients with ARI in southern 194 China 31 and Japan. 32 195 HMPV is commonly found in the pediatric population, with children under 5 196 year3old most susceptible to and children under 2 year3old at the greatest risk for 197 serious HMPV infections. 15 In our study, more frequency of HMPV infection occurred 198 in patients \u22645 year3old (2.2%, 98/4399) than in patients >5 year3old (0.7%, 5/734) 199 ( =0.004), which is consistent with most previous studies. 3 30 33 34 In detail, HMPV 200 infection were found high frequency in children with the age groups of 3-6 201 months, >6-12 months, >1-2 years and >2-5 years ( =0.865) (-) . Therefore, 202 children of this age need more attention to prevent HMPV infection. Moreover, our 203 findings suggested a male predominance, there was no significant difference in the 204 HMPV has a typical seasonal distribution. The activity of HMPV is largely 207 affected by different climate factors, which are locally present. The activity of HMPV in 208 temperate climates peaks at the end of winter or in early spring. 37 38 In this study, 209 seasonal peaks of HMPV infection were detected in February 2016, March 2014, and 210 May 2015 (-) . This finding indicates that in Guangzhou, HMPV circulates 211 primarily during the spring and early summer, as previously reported in other 212 subtropical areas. 22 39 Furthermore, we also found small peaks in November 2014, 213 September 2015, and May 2016 (-) . Generally, the seasonal distribution 214 pattern of HMPV overlaps that of RSV in this area. 19 These data might be useful for 215 control and prevention strategies of HMPV. 216 HMPV co3infection with other respiratory pathogens has been reported in 217 many studies, including RSV, 40 InfA, 41 InfB, 42 PIV, 43 ADV, 43 44 HBoV, 45 HCoV , 43 46 RV, 43 218 EV, 43 MP, 41 and CP. 41 In this study, most HMPV3positive patients had mono3infection 219 (81.6%, 84/103), and there was no significant difference in the HMPV positivity rate 220 according to sex between HMPV mono3 and co3infected patients ( =0.469). The 221 co3infection rate was 18.4% (19/103), and the most frequently detected co3pathogen 222 was RSV (36.8%, 7/19) () ), which might be due to the overlapping seasonal 223 distribution of HMPV and RSV. 47 Co3infection with HCoV3OC43, MP, HBoV, ADV, RV, 224 InfA, PIV2, and PIV3 occurred at rates >5%, suggesting a broad range of 225 co3pathogens in HMPV infection () ). the respective mono3infections remains unclear. A previous study showed that 251 children with HMPV/RSV co3infection were more likely to develop pneumonia, 252 however, disease severity was not increased. 53 Conversely, Semple et al. 56 reported 253 that HMPV/RSV co3infection can cause more severe bronchiolitis in patients. In our 254 study, no significant difference in the pneumonia rate was observed between HMPV 255 mono3 and co3infected patients. It has been confirmed that a history of prematurity, 256 particular age groups, and the presence of chronic diseases increases the risk of 257 severe LRTI among HMPV3 and RSV3infected children. 51 The clinical manifestations 258 of HMPV infection are complex and diverse; the data in this work might be helpful in 259 the diagnosis of HMPV. In this study, the characteristics of HMPV3negative patients 260",

In this 33year study, 103 of 5133 (2.0%) patients were positive 213 for HMPV, which is similar to previous reports of HMPV in patients with ARI in 214 southern China 31 and Japan. 32 215 HMPV is commonly found in the pediatric population; Children younger than 5 216 years of age are most susceptible to HMPV infection, and those younger than 2 years 217 of age at the greatest risk of developing serious conditions. 15 In our study, HMPV 218 positive cases appeared more frequently in patients \u22645 year3old (2.2%, 98/4399) than 219 in patients >5 year3old (0.7%, 5/734) ( =0.004), which is consistent with many 220 previous studies. 3 30 33 34 In detail, HMPV positive rate was high in children of 3 months 221 to 5 years (2.4%, 93/3920) (/ ).

It has been confirmed that a history of prematurity, particular age groups, 268 and the presence of chronic diseases increases the risk of severe LRTI among 269 HMPV3 and RSV3infected children. 51 Our study suggests that the clinical 270 manifestations of HMPV infection are complex and diverse; our data will be helpful in 271 the diagnosis of HMPV. 272 In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and clinical 273 characteristics of HMPV in more than 5000 children with ARI in two tertiary hospitals 274 in Guangzhou, which is an international metropolis and the most important political, 275 economic and cultural center in southern China. Therefore, the results are not limited 276 to the two hospital cases, but also represent and reflect HMPV infection in children 277 with ARI in south China and play a positive role in the prevention and diagnosis of 278",

Samples in this study were taken as part of standard care. Throat swab 93 collected at two hospitals between July 2013 and June 2016. ARI was defined as an 95 illness that presented with at least two of the following symptoms: cough, pharyngeal 96 discomfort, nasal obstruction, coryza, sneeze, dyspnoea, or diagnosed with 97 pneumonia by chest radiography during the previous week. Chest radiography was 98 performed based on the clinical situation of the patients. The samples were collected 99 according to established clinical protocols. 17 The samples were refrigerated at 2-8\u00b0C 100 in viral transport medium, transported on ice to the State Key Laboratory of 101 Respiratory Diseases, and analyzed immediately or stored at 380\u00b0C before analysis 102 as previously described. 18 103 The patients' clinical presentations or diagnoses were extracted from their 104 medical records using designed presentation cards and were retrospectively 105 categorized into the following four groups: URTI, LRTI, systemic influenza3like 106 symptoms, and gastrointestinal illness.

Patients with vomiting, poor appetite, or diarrhea 113 were categorized as having gastrointestinal illness. Some patients were assigned to 114 several clinical presentation groups. Patients with incomplete clinical data were 115 excluded from this analysis. Increased lung markings, bronchopneumonia, 116 pneumonia, and bronchiolitis were diagnosed by chest radiography. Abnormal 117 pulmonary breath sounds included phlegmatic rales, wheezy rales, bubbling rales, 118 and moist rales.

HMPV has a seasonal variation. 5133 patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illness at two large municipal 49 tertiary hospitals (hospital beds \ufe651000) were enrolled on the study over 3 years.Patients aged from 1 day to 14 years old were tested for HMPV using Taqman 51Clinical characteristics of patients with HMPV3positive were recorded.There was incomplete HMPV co3pathogen detection, because bacterial 54 pathogens were not detected for HMPV3positive patients.The clinical characteristics of HMPV3negative patients and outcome data 56 (discharge/death) for the HMPV3positive patients were not collected for further 57 analysis, limiting our understanding of this pathogen.For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml first discovered in 2001 in the Netherlands, after being isolated from a pediatric patient 63 with acute respiratory illness (ARI). 2 Since then, HMPV has been associated with 64 acute respiratory disease in individuals of all ages worldwide. Children, elderly and 65 immunocompromised adults are most at risk of contracting the virus. 335 Children 66 younger than 5 years of age seem to be particularly susceptible to HMPV. Previous 67 studies, 6312 which were mainly conducted in developed countries, have revealed that 68 approximately 2.5%-11.3% of respiratory samples were positive for HMPV in children 69 \u22645 years, and 90% of individuals were seropositive for HMPV by 5 years of age. 13 70 HMPV causes a variety of clinical symptoms ranging from a mild upper 71 respiratory tract infection (URTI) to life3threatening lower respiratory tract infection 72 (LRTI). 3 14316 However, to date, there is no effective vaccine or specific medication 73 either for prevention or treatment of HMPV infection. Consequently, it is imperative to 74 conduct more studies, especially in low and middle3income countries, to understand 75 this pathogen in different areas and populations.In this study, we investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of HMPV 77 in pediatric patients, from July 2013 to June 2016. The findings of this study will help 78 understand the distribution of HMPV in a subtropical region.

Throat swab samples (n=5133) from pediatric patients (\u226414 years) 85 hospitalized with ARI, were collected at two hospitals between July 2013 and June 86 2016. ARI was defined as an illness that presented with at least two of the following 87 clinical presentations: cough, nasal obstruction, coryza, sneeze, dyspnoea during the 88 previous week. Patients, who were diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography 89 during the previous week, were also included in the study, even if they did not show 90 the clinical features described above. Some patients, who had been cured and 91 discharged some time ago and readmitted because of new episodes of ARI, if met the 92 recruitment criteria, were included in the study as new cases, otherwise excluded.Chest radiography was performed based on the clinical situation of the patients.The 94 samples were collected according to established clinical protocols. 17 The samples 95 were refrigerated at 2-8\u00b0C in viral transport medium, transported on ice to the State 96 Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, and analyzed immediately or stored at 380\u00b0C 97 before analysis as previously described. 18 98 The patients' clinical presentations or diagnoses were recorded from patients' 99 medical records by attending physicians, using designed presentation cards and were 100 categorized retrospectively into the following four groups: URTI, LRTI, systemic 101 influenza3like symptoms, and gastrointestinal illness. Patients with nasal obstruction, 102 coryza, sneezing, coughing, expectoration, or hoarseness were categorized as 103 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml having URTI. Patients with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, increased 104 lung markings, dyspnea, or an abnormal pulmonary breath sound were categorized 105 as having LRTI. Patients with a high fever (\u226538\u00b0C), chills, or debilitation were 106 categorized as having systemic influenza3like symptoms. Patients with vomiting, poor 107 appetite, or diarrhea were categorized as having gastrointestinal illness. Some 108 patients were assigned to several clinical presentation groups. Patients with 109 incomplete clinical data were excluded from this analysis. Increased lung markings, 110 bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis were diagnosed by chest 111 radiography. Abnormal pulmonary breath sounds included phlegmatic, wheezy, 112 bubbling, and moist rales. Other clinical symptoms were identified by a general 113 medical examination and clinical descriptions, as previously reported. 19 114 RNA was extracted from the throat swab samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA 117 Mini Kit (Qiagen, Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer's protocols. HMPV 118 was identified by using TaqMan Real3time PCR assays, as previously reported, 18 119 using kits from Guangzhou HuYanSuo Medical Technology Co., Ltd according to the 120 manufacturer's protocols. In brief, 50 \u03bcl RNA were extracted from a 200 \u03bcl sample, 121 and real3time PCR was conducted using 25 \u03bcl reaction mix, containing M3MLV, Taq 122 polymerase and 5 \u03bcl extracted RNA.

We analyzed the clinical presentation of 101 of the 103 (98.1%) HMPV3positive 178 patients, the other two patients were excluded from this analysis because of 179 incomplete clinical data. The main clinical features of HMPV3positive patients included 180 cough (100.0%, 101/101), abnormal pulmonary breath sound (91.1%, 92/101), fever 181 (88.1%, 89/101), expectoration (77.2%, 78/101), coryza (50.5%, 51/101) and 182 wheezing (46.5%, 47/101).

Conversely, 190 diarrhea appeared more often in patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected 191 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml Viruses are the most frequent cause of respiratory infections. 20 HMPV has 195 been recognized as an important cause of ARI since its discovery in 2001. A previous 196 study reported HMPV was responsible for approximately 5-10% of hospitalizations in 197 children suffering from ARI, 14 creating a considerable clinical and economic burden 198 worldwide. HMPV detection rates vary according to geographic location, and the 199 incidence of HMPV may show seasonal or annual patterns in the same area. In 200 previous studies, 21330 HMPV was detected in approximately 1%-17% of ARI cases. In 201 this 3 year study, 103 of 5133 (2.0%) patients were positive for HMPV, which is similar 202 to previous reports of HMPV in patients with ARI in southern China 31 and Japan. 32 203 Children under 5 years of age are most susceptible to HMPV infection, and 204 those younger than 2 years of age are at the greatest risk of developing serious 205 conditions. 15 In our study, HMPV3positive cases appeared more frequently in patients 206 which is consistent with many previous studies. 3 30 33 34 Specifically, HMPV prevalence 208 was highest in children >1-2 years (2.8%, 21/752). This may be explained by the 209 immunity against HMPV, which is passed down from mother3to3child, gradually 210 subsiding over time. Moreover, children were more contact with outside world as they 211 grew older. Therefore, children of this age need more attention to prevent HMPV 212 infection. Moreover, our findings suggested no difference in risk between sex, there 213 was no significant difference in the HMPV prevalence between male and female 214 patients ( =0.771), which is consistent with previous studies. 35 36 215 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml HMPV has a typical seasonal distribution. HMPV activity is largely affected by 216 different local climate factors. The prevalence of HMPV in temperate climates peaks 217 at the end of winter or in early spring. 37 38 In our study, seasonal peaks of HMPV were 218 detected in February 2016, March 2014 and May 2015. This finding indicates that 219 HMPV circulates primarily during the spring and early summer in Guangzhou, this 220 pattern is similar to previous reports from other subtropical areas. 22 39 Furthermore, we 221 also found small peaks in November 2014, September 2015, and May 2016, the 222 reason for this is unknown. It should be noted that the seasonal distribution of HMPV 223 overlaps with RSV in this geographical area. 19 Knowing the epidemiological 224 characteristics of HMPV will help public health authorities and clinicians to improve 225 strategies for controlling HMPV infection. 226 HMPV co3infection with other respiratory pathogens has been reported in 227 many studies, including RSV, 40 InfA, 41 InfB, 42 PIV, 43 ADV, 43 44 HBoV, 45 HCoV , 43 46 228 HRV, 43 EV, 43 MP, 41 and CP. 41 In our study, most HMPV3positive patients only had 229 HMPV (81.6%, 84/103), and there was no significant difference in the HMPV 230 prevalence according to sex between the patients with only HMPV detected and the 231 patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected ( =0.469). The co3detection rate 232 was 18.4% (19/103), and RSV (36.8%, 7/19) was the most frequently co3detected 233 pathogen, which might be because of the overlapping seasonal distribution of these 234 two pathogens. 47 Co3detection rates of HCoV3OC43, MP, HBoV, ADV, HRV, InfA, PIV2, 235 and PIV3 were over 5%, suggesting a broad range of respiratory pathogens could 236 co3exist with HMPV in ARI pediatric patients. For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml HMPV most commonly causes URTI and LRTI in young children. The clinical 238 manifestations of HMPV3positive patients are similar to those of RSV3positive patients, 239 especially in young children. 48350 In previous studies, the most frequent diagnoses of 240 children hospitalized with HMPV infection were pneumonitis and bronchiolitis. 3 51 52 In 241 some studies, bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing/pneumonia were the main clinical 242 diagnoses, 7 22 53 54 while in other studies, bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis, and 243 bronchial asthma exacerbation were the main clinical diagnoses. 34 Our study showed 244 were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia by chest 246 radiography, respectively. Of all the clinical features recorded, cough (100.0%, 247 101/101), abnormal pulmonary breath sound (91.1%, 92/101), fever (88.1%, 89/101), 248 Most of the HMPV3positive patients had a fever (88.1%, 89/101); it appeared 252 more frequently in patients with only HMPV detected than in the patients with HMPV 253 plus other pathogen(s) detected ( =0.037). Diarrhea was not a major symptom in 254 HMPV3positive patients (7.0%, 7/101), but it had a higher prevalence in patients with 255 HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected than in the patients with only HMPV detected 256 significant difference was found in the other clinical features between the patients with 258 only HMPV detected and the patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected, 259 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml similar to the results of a previous study. 51 260 In our study, RSV (36.8%, 7/19) was the most frequently co3detected pathogen 261 in HMPV3positive patients. Whether HMPV/RSV co3infection is more severe than the 262 respective mono3infections remains unclear. A previous study showed that children 263 with HMPV/RSV co3infection were more likely to develop pneumonia; however, 264 disease severity was not increased. 53 Conversely, Semple et al. 56 reported that 265 HMPV/RSV co3infection can cause more severe bronchiolitis in patients. In our study, 266 no significant difference in the diagnosis of pneumonia was observed between the 267 patients with only HMPV detected and the patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) 268 detected. It has been confirmed that a history of prematurity, particular age groups, 269 and the presence of chronic diseases increases the risk of severe LRTI among 270 HMPV3 and RSV3infected children. 51 Our study suggests that the clinical 271manifestations of HMPV infection are complex and diverse; our data will be helpful in 272 the diagnosis of HMPV. The study had some limitations. First, collection of data on symptoms and 274 physical findings in infants and young children requires experienced medical staff, 275 patient's cooperation, and consent from the patient's guardian. Consequently, it is 276 possible we will have incomplete or even an inaccurate description of patients' 277 manifestations. Second, because our study mainly focused on HMPV, other common 278 respiratory pathogens, including bacterial pathogens, were not tested and 279 subsequently our study does not give a fully account of respiratory pathogen infection 280 in hospitalized pediatric patients with ARI. Third, the characteristics of HMPV3negative 281 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml patients and outcome data (discharge/death) were not analyzed further, because our 282 study only focused on the epidemiological and clinical features of HMPV positive 283 cases. This might affect our understanding of the clinical features of HMPV3positive 284 patients. Despite these shortcomings, our results provide a valuable insight into the 285 epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HMPV present in patients hospitalized 286 with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China.For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtmlHMPV is an important respiratory pathogen in children with ARI in Guangzhou\uff0c 289China, particularly in children under 5 years old.

Children, elderly and 65 immunocompromised adults are most at risk of contracting the virus. 335 Children 66 younger than 5 years of age seem to be particularly susceptible to HMPV. Previous 67 studies, 6312 which were mainly conducted in developed countries, have revealed that 68 approximately 2.5%-11.3% of respiratory samples were positive for HMPV in children 69 \u22645 years, and 90% of individuals were seropositive for HMPV by 5 years of age. 13 70 HMPV causes a variety of clinical symptoms ranging from a mild upper 71 respiratory tract infection (URTI) to life3threatening lower respiratory tract infection 72 (LRTI). 3 14316 However, to date, there is no effective vaccine or specific medication 73 either for prevention or treatment of HMPV infection. Consequently, it is imperative to 74conduct more studies, especially in low and middle3income countries, to understand 75 this pathogen in different areas and populations.In this study, we investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of HMPV 77 in pediatric patients, from July 2013 to June 2016.

Throat swab samples (n=5133) from pediatric patients (\u226414 years) 85 hospitalized with ARI, were collected at two hospitals between July 2013 and June 86 2016. ARI was defined as an illness that presented with at least two of the following 87 clinical presentations: cough, nasal obstruction, coryza, sneeze, dyspnoea during the 88 previous week. Patients, who were diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography 89 during the previous week, were also included in the study, even if they did not show 90 the clinical features described above. Some patients, who had been cured and 91 discharged some time ago and readmitted because of new episodes of ARI, if met the 92 recruitment criteria, were included in the study as new cases, otherwise excluded.Chest radiography was performed based on the clinical situation of the patients.The 94 samples were collected according to established clinical protocols. 17 The samples 95 were refrigerated at 2-8\u00b0C in viral transport medium, transported on ice to the State 96 Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, and analyzed immediately or stored at 380\u00b0C 97 before analysis as previously described. 18 98 The patients' clinical presentations or diagnoses were recorded from patients' 99 medical records by attending physicians, using designed presentation cards and were 100 categorized retrospectively into the following four groups: URTI, LRTI, systemic 101 influenza3like symptoms, and gastrointestinal illness. Patients with nasal obstruction, 102 coryza, sneezing, coughing, expectoration, or hoarseness were categorized as 103 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml having URTI. Patients with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, increased 104 lung markings, dyspnea, or an abnormal pulmonary breath sound were categorized 105 as having LRTI. Patients with a high fever (\u226538\u00b0C), chills, or debilitation were 106 categorized as having systemic influenza3like symptoms. Patients with vomiting, poor 107 appetite, or diarrhea were categorized as having gastrointestinal illness. Some 108 patients were assigned to several clinical presentation groups. Patients with 109 incomplete clinical data were excluded from this analysis. Increased lung markings, 110 bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis were diagnosed by chest 111 radiography. Abnormal pulmonary breath sounds included phlegmatic, wheezy, 112 bubbling, and moist rales. Other clinical symptoms were identified by a general 113 medical examination and clinical descriptions, as previously reported. 19 114 RNA was extracted from the throat swab samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA 117 Mini Kit (Qiagen, Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer's protocols.

A previous 195 study reported HMPV was responsible for approximately 5-10% of hospitalizations in 196 children suffering from ARI, 14 creating a considerable clinical and economic burden 197 worldwide. HMPV detection rates vary according to geographic location, and the 198 incidence of HMPV may show seasonal or annual patterns in the same area. In 199 previous studies, 21330 HMPV was detected in approximately 1%-17% of ARI cases. In 200 this 3 year study, 103 of 5133 (2.0%) patients were positive for HMPV, which is similar 201 to previous reports of HMPV in patients with ARI in southern China 31 and Japan. 32 202 Children under 5 years of age are most susceptible to HMPV infection, and 203 those younger than 2 years of age are at the greatest risk of developing serious 204conditions. 15 In our study, HMPV3positive cases appeared more frequently in patients 205 which is consistent with many previous studies. 3 30 33 34 Specifically, HMPV prevalence 207 was highest in children >1-2 years (2.8%, 21/752). This may be explained by the 208 immunity against HMPV, which is passed down from mother3to3child, gradually 209 subsiding over time. Moreover, children were more contact with outside world as they 210 grew older. Therefore, children of this age need more attention to prevent HMPV 211 infection. Moreover, our findings suggested no difference in risk between sex, there 212 was no significant difference in the HMPV prevalence between male and female 213 patients ( =0.771), which is consistent with previous studies.35  36 214 Page 12 of 35 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml HMPV has a typical seasonal distribution. HMPV activity is largely affected by 215 different local climate factors. The prevalence of HMPV in temperate climates peaks 216 at the end of winter or in early spring. 37 38 In our study, seasonal peaks of HMPV were 217 detected in February 2016, March 2014 and May 2015. This finding indicates that 218 HMPV circulates primarily during the spring and early summer in Guangzhou, this 219 pattern is similar to previous reports from other subtropical areas. 22 39 Furthermore, we 220 also found small peaks in November 2014, September 2015, and May 2016, the 221 reason for this is unknown. It should be noted that the seasonal distribution of HMPV 222 overlaps with RSV in this geographical area. 19 Knowing the epidemiological 223 characteristics of HMPV will help public health authorities and clinicians to improve 224 strategies for controlling HMPV infection. 225 HMPV co3infection with other respiratory pathogens has been reported in 226 many studies, including RSV, 40 InfA, 41 InfB, 42 PIV, 43 ADV, 43 44 HBoV, 45 HCoV , 43 46 227 HRV, 43 EV, 43 MP, 41 and CP. 41 In our study, most HMPV3positive patients only had 228 HMPV (81.6%, 84/103), and there was no significant difference in the HMPV 229 prevalence according to sex between the patients with only HMPV detected and the 230 patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected ( =0.469). The co3detection rate 231 was 18.4% (19/103), and RSV (36.8%, 7/19) was the most frequently co3detected 232 pathogen, which might be because of the overlapping seasonal distribution of these 233 two pathogens. 47 Co3detection rates of HCoV3OC43, MP, HBoV, ADV, HRV, InfA, PIV2, 234 and PIV3 were over 5%, suggesting a broad range of respiratory pathogens could 235 co3exist with HMPV in ARI pediatric patients. Page 13 of 35 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml HMPV most commonly causes URTI and LRTI in young children. The clinical 237 manifestations of HMPV3positive patients are similar to those of RSV3positive patients, 238 especially in young children. 48350 In previous studies, the most frequent diagnoses of 239 children hospitalized with HMPV infection were pneumonitis and bronchiolitis. 3 51 52 In 240 some studies, bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing/pneumonia were the main clinical 241 diagnoses, 7 22 53 54 while in other studies, bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis, and 242 bronchial asthma exacerbation were the main clinical diagnoses. 34 Our study showed 243 that 66.7% (56/84), 9.5% (8/84) and 13.1% (11/84) of HMPV3positive patients were 244 diagnosed with bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia by chest 245 radiography, respectively. Of all the clinical features recorded, cough (100.0%, 246 101/101), abnormal pulmonary breath sound (91.1%, 92/101), fever (88.1%, 89/101), 247 expectoration (77.2%, 78/101), coryza (50.5%, 51/101), and wheezing (46.5%, 248 47/101) occurred frequently in HMPV3positive patients, similar to those reported 249 Most of the HMPV3positive patients had a fever (88.1%, 89/101); it appeared 251 more frequently in patients with only HMPV detected than in the patients with HMPV 252 plus other pathogen(s) detected ( =0.037). Diarrhea was not a major symptom in 253 HMPV3positive patients (7.0%, 7/101), but it had a higher prevalence in patients with 254 HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected than in the patients with only HMPV detected 255 ( ), suggesting that diarrhea is probably caused by other pathogens. No 256 significant difference was found in the other clinical features between the patients with 257 only HMPV detected and the patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected, 258 Page 14 of 35 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml similar to the results of a previous study. 51 259 In our study, RSV (36.8%, 7/19) was the most frequently co3detected pathogen 260 in HMPV3positive patients. Whether HMPV/RSV co3infection is more severe than the 261 respective mono3infections remains unclear. A previous study showed that children 262 with HMPV/RSV co3infection were more likely to develop pneumonia; however, 263 disease severity was not increased. 53 Conversely, Semple et al. 56 reported that 264HMPV/RSV co3infection can cause more severe bronchiolitis in patients. In our study, 265 no significant difference in the diagnosis of pneumonia was observed between the 266 patients with only HMPV detected and the patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) 267",
