The absence of a streamlined process for screening and documenting travel history can lead to missed identification of patients who are potentially infected. 5 To address this challenge, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States developed an algorithm, termed \"Identify, Isolate, Inform,\" to provide guidance for emergency departments and other health care points of entry on the evaluation and management of persons suspected of having EVD. 6 The algorithm is adaptable, having been modified for MERS, mumps, measles, and Zika; a similar algorithm was developed specifically for emergency medical services (EMS).",

In August 2014, at the height of domestic preparations for EVD, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of EVD in a Midwest emergency department and outpatient clinics on the basis of patients' travel histories and symptoms; details of the development process were published in 2015. 12 Initially a paper version, the travel-screening algorithm was converted to an electronic format in October 2014 to provide visibility from the initial intake to providers downstream and provide clear and succinct directions to ensure proper identification, isolation, and care of a suspected patient. Since 2014, the algorithm has become a hardwired process throughout the organization. INTERVENTION Two unique strategies were used to identify, isolate, and inform about patients in the emergency department with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases. One was the use of the robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record (EMR). The second strategy used was the availability of workflow protocols at Nebraska Medicine for EVD, MERS (Supplementary Figure 1) , and COVID-19 (Supplementary Figure 2 ) once a person under investigation was identified. The workflow algorithms, available on the hospital's intranet, are updated at regular intervals to reflect changing needs and best practices.

For patients who were identified through the screening process as potential high-risk cases for EVD or MERS, there was a risk that care would be delayed for a more common diagnosis while testing for the highly hazardous communicable disease was conducted. As a result, a process was developed to continue diagnostic testing and treatment of the more common illnesses while awaiting test results for MERS or EVD. In addition, there were ethical aspects related to maintaining the isolation of a person under investigation who elected to leave before the test results were available. To address these cases, a process was developed for local public health officials, hospital infection control, and ED providers to conduct risk-benefit analyses jointly on the basis of risks to the public, the option to place a medical hold until the test results were available for cases with public health concerns, and the likelihood of the individual maintaining self-quarantine if the risk was determined to be low.",

This promotion of proper infection-prevention practices reduces their exposure to others at the earliest moment of their ED visit. The second question upon emergency department or outpatient clinic presentation, the travel-screening question, originally only captured individuals who had a pertinent travel history; our updated version included those who may have been in direct contact with someone recently returned from an area with an active outbreak. In addition, the travel period was extended to allow for the use of 1 question for multiple pathogen-incubation periods. Thus, the travel screening question was rephrased from \"Have you traveled outside of the US in the last 21 days\" to \"Have you traveled and/or been in contact with a person that has traveled outside of the country within the last month?\"",

In South Korea, a single traveler returning from the Middle East with undiagnosed MERS resulted in an outbreak of 186 additional cases after he presented to an emergency department. 13 Although not all regional Ebola and other special pathogen treatment centers in the United States require that a patient with suspected or confirmed MERS be cared for in a highlevel isolation unit, this case highlights the impact superspreaders can have in a health care setting without the most advanced engineering and administrative controls and emphasizes the critical need to identify patients with a highly hazardous communicable disease at the earliest possible time point.",

In addition, from a public health perspective, consideration should be given to plans for patients who attempt to leave against medical advice. It is important to note that the index patient in the previously mentioned MERS outbreak in South Korea initially denied travel to the Middle East; therefore, inaccurate travel and medical histories are real-world possibilities that should be considered when patients present for care. Early involvement of specialists in infectious diseases is recommended so that they may assist with the epidemiologic evaluation. The availability of diagnostic testing for patients with suspected EVD and MERS is an important aspect of the evaluation of a person under investigation, and emphasis should be placed on timely and appropriate specimen collection, as well as ensuring the availability of laboratory personnel with experience in performing the necessary diagnostic tests. At our institution, a link to a video detailing the process of appropriate respiratory specimen collection is included in our MERS person-under-investigation evaluation protocol. Public health laboratory staff are on-call 24/ 7, and early laboratory notification is necessary to ensure timely processing of specimens.

Although communicable diseases such as EVD and MERS are of concern owing to their high mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common diseases such as measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the health care environment. This process improvement project had some limitations. Owing to the challenges in extracting aggregated data through our hospital EMR, the percentage of patients presenting to the emergency department or outpatient clinics who were screened and flagged, as well as the number of exposure investigations conducted before the implementation of the EMR algorithm, are all estimates from the hospital and ED leadership. As such, the collection method for this data relies on experts' reporting and is not comprehensive or robust. Systematic data collection is recommended for hospitals looking to implement and quantify the impact of implementing such an algorithm. In addition, although we believe that the described algorithm is straightforward and concise, screening outcomes rely on human factors for compliance and implementation. 14 In this case, the process rests on greeter nurses and registration staff posing the screening questions to every patient entering the emergency department or other health care entry point, regardless of visible symptoms. Education on the importance of the algorithm and the critical advantage of identifying and masking Q13 symptoms early is needed to ensure that those interacting with patients implement the process. In addition, diseases are ever evolving, and outbreaks undoubtedly will emerge in different regions of the world. As such, there is a need for health care teams to monitor current disease threats around the world continually and to update the system to match those events. Last, the travel-screening algorithm has undergone a number of revisions over the last 5 years and will continue to be updated on the basis of the lessons learned. Health care systems adopting a strategy similar to the one we have described must be open to modifying it to fit local, national, and international circumstances and needs.",
