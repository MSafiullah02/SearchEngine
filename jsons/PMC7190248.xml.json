In response to a sentinel event in which a deteriorating patient presented directly to the pediatric inpatient ward and suffered a serious adverse outcome, an interdisciplinary hospital team developed a novel ED evaluation process for children accepted for direct admission to the hospital.

The evaluation includes vital signs and a brief evaluation by the physician and the nurse to assess clinical stability and the potential need for urgent intervention. If the patient is stable, the ED nurse and physician document the ED RAPID evaluation encounter in the EHR using very brief standardized documentation templates (Fig. 1). Then, the patient is escorted directly to the inpatient hospital ward. If the patient is found to have signs of respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic instability necessitating resuscitation or other urgent intervention,12 the ED RAPID process is stopped, and the patient becomes a standard ED patient. The entire process of ED RAPID evaluation and documentation was designed to take the ED physician and the nurse less than 5 minutes. Figure 2 outlines the process.

Although the patient log used to identify study patients was maintained prospectively, we may have failed to capture some patients who received ED RAPID evaluation, and there was no means to identify patients designated for ED RAPID evaluation who inadvertently bypassed the process by presenting directly to the hospital ward.

Likewise, as we did not prospectively track the phone calls involved in arranging the direct admissions, we are unable to comment on the frequency with which the process required multiple phone calls or the time spent in phone coordination. Also, the ED RAPID evaluation process was not intended to identify direct admission patients that may have been safely discharged home after ED evaluation and care. Thus, we may have admitted some patients via the process that could have been treated and discharged from the ED. However, the ED RAPID evaluation process does not increase this likelihood when compared with standard direct admission. We do not currently have data regarding the effects of this process on patient-centered outcomes such as patient satisfaction, admission throughput, and the frequency of brief admissions that additional ED-based management may have averted; quality improvement targeting these outcomes would be a useful area for further research. Although the ED RAPID evaluation process includes formal evaluation of vital signs, it ultimately relies on a brief clinical assessment by ED attending physicians and nurses rather than standardized, objective measures. There is variation between providers inherent to this process; future improvement efforts could target this variability. We found that infants and patients with respiratory difficulties were the most likely to require ICU admission rather than direct ward admission through this process; institutions considering implementing a similar process may wish to take this into account. Finally, this process was studied in a lower volume (15,000 annual visits) high complexity-acuity (20% admission rate) university children\u2019s hospital ED. Although the implementation of this process in hospitals with larger ED volumes is untested, if resources allow, such hospitals may wish to consider this as a process with the potential to decrease ED volumes.",

When performed by pediatric ED attending physicians and nurses, the ED RAPID evaluation is feasible and effective, identifying a small but high-risk group of patients who required ED stabilization or diversion to the ICU; these patients were more likely to be infants and to have respiratory illnesses. Implementation of a similar pediatric direct admission process at other institutions may depend upon hospital staffing, referral patterns, resources, and patient populations, but this experience shows that it is possible in the right setting. The ED RAPID evaluation process simultaneously supports both the cost-effective, patient-centered practice of direct hospital ward admission and patient safety.",
