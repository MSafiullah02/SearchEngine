The war's end was marked by efforts to establish a body that would facilitate peaceful relations among member countries. In 1945, the United Nations (U.N.) was established \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\" and to \"promote social progress and better standards of life\" (U. N. 1945 ). Various U.N. agencies were set up to realize these goals-most prominently the World Health Organization (WHO) , founded in 1948 \"to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work\" (WHO 1948 ) . 1 Yet even as these institutions were being established, their ability to encourage international collaboration was hampered in two ways.",

These rivalries often impeded coordinated actions involving health. For example, the 1950s and 1960s were marked by the superpowers' competitive attempts to eradicate specifi c (often communicable) diseases (e.g., the United States targeted malaria while the Soviet Union focused on smallpox) (WHO 2008b ) . This selective, disease-specifi c vertical approach confl icted with the realization in the 1970s that primary health care was a vital component of a national health system. The latter approach defi ned \"health\" broadly, recognizing it as a right and acknowledging the impact of socioeconomic factors on wellness (WHO 1978 ) . The emphasis on primary health care became critical for governments of newly independent countries faced with the task of expanding health systems that under colonial rule had catered to a narrow, privileged segment of the population (WHO 2008a ) . However, ideological disputes over government's role in society and the policies of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , which favored privatization of certain public services (Stuckler and Basu 2009 ) , neglected the primary health care approach (WHO 2008b ) . The Cold War also infl uenced patterns of global health collaboration , particularly among members of feuding coalitions that continued to support ideologic allies (Feldbaum et al. 2010 ) .",

General Assembly declared their commitment to achieving eight objectives (the Millennium Development Goals) by 2015-half of which pertained to health. Also signifi cant were widespread efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic through such mechanisms as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 3 and the more recently established Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 4 On the other hand , the growing infl uence of liberal and capitalist principles in the global environment of the 1990s affected the extent to which governments (especially those of LMICs ) were involved and able to collaborate in public health. These changes included \u2026 an increasing reliance upon the free market; a signifi cant growth in the infl uence of international fi nancial markets and institutions in determining national policies ; cutbacks in public sector spending; the privatization of functions previously considered to be the exclusive domain of the state; and the deregulation of a range of activities with a view to facilitating investment and rewarding entrepreneurial initiative. These trends serve to reduce the role of the state in economic affairs, and at the same time increase the role and responsibilities of private (non-state) actors, especially those in corporate business, but also those in civil society\u2026. (WHO 2002 ) Generally associated with neoliberal principles , the changes discussed above have reduced governments ' public policy role. These developments notwithstanding, there remain compelling arguments for deliberate and sustained engagement by governments in the interest of global public health . Three are discussed below.",

Individual citizens can take responsibility for personal health, but certain health benefi ts (e.g., clean air, safe roads, potable water) can be secured only through organized, collective efforts generally involving the exercise of public authority. As such, in the interest of global health , a country's public health institutions should be robust-equipped to protect population health , reduce disease, and administer programs that save money and lives (Frieden and Koplan 2010 ) . This case needs to be made for LMICs especially; otherwise, neoliberal principles guiding globalization may further weaken emergent, poorly governed, or underfunded health systems.",

In Jensen and Gaie's case, an LMIC government has neither passed legislation nor provided support that would effectively prevent discrimination against citizens seeking HIV services. In Zinner's case, an international aid worker must make diffi cult decisions about who gets preventive HIV/AIDS treatment in an African community characterized by a neglected, poorly funded health system. In Timms' case, a physician encounters an ethical challenge brought about by the underdeveloped health infrastructure in India , the government's lax enforcement of research regulations , and the substantial infl uence of large foreign pharmaceutical companies on national policy . In List and Boyd's case, a foreign researcher must decide whether there is an ethical obligation to expose an African government's avoidable failure to prevent a TB medication stock-out . Under question in Millum's case is the degree to which both the U.N. (as a collective body of governments carrying out a humanitarian intervention) and the Haitian government (as the provider of health infrastructure for its citizens) can be held morally or legally liable for a cholera outbreak. In Al-Faisal, Hussain, and Sen's case, a public health expert testifying before a U.N. Commission must weigh in on the extent to which (1) foreign governments are obliged to minimize harm to the health of Syrians and Iraqis when applying sanctions and (2) Syrian and Iraqi governments are obliged to conduct a foreign policy that does not jeopardize the health of their citizens.

A government's continued involvement is indispensable to shaping broad-based and sustainable solutions to the challenges of global public health . The broad scope of a government's responsibilities (and authority associated with performing these responsibilities) enables it to coordinate public health efforts involving public, private, and civic institutions. The importance of governmental involvement was crystallized in the words of former WHO Director General, Gro Harlem Brundtland, as the 2003 WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was being drafted: \"Tobacco control cannot succeed solely through the efforts of individual governments , national NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) , and media advocates. We need an international response to an international problem\" (Bodansky 1999 ) . Tackling one of the world's leading causes of preventable death (i.e., smoking ), the Framework Convention adopts a comprehensive strategy that has been signed by the governments of 168 countries. 5 With completion of the human genome and development of various technologies to use it, interest in DNA repositories has surged (Kaye et al. 2009 ). The development and increasing use of biorepositories of DNA, tissues, and other biological materials in institutions worldwide present far-reaching ethical challenges. Some challenges, such as those resulting from the collection and use of dried blood spots (Hendrix et al. 2013 ) or from regular surveillance like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV surveillance projects, are recurrent and familiar. 6 When specimens must be shared in the context of collaborative public health emergency response and planning, the challenges can take on greater urgency. Such emergency collaborative sharing has occurred with virus strains for pandemic infl uenza planning 7 and with the sequencing of the SARS coronavirus jointly undertaken by researchers from Canada, Hong Kong, Taipei, the United States , and Vietnam during the global outbreak (Tong et al. 2004 ) . Similarly, the sharing of data and health information has long been a source of ethical and legal commentary and is widely viewed as desirable ethical behavior with demonstrable scientifi c benefi t (Committee on National Statistics 1985 ; Benkler and Nissenbaum 2006 ) .",

Because public health is of general concern, a level of accountability is essential for the entire health system to function properly.

Among the most useful was the attention focused on how ethical arguments are applied to substantive problems in global health Varmus and Satcher 1997 ) . Until then, most bioethical refl ection had concentrated on domestic topics, aside from revisions to the Declaration of Helsinki and other documents. ACTG-076, however , energized discussion about, among other things, the nature of ethical obligations and commitments to groups, countries, and regions-whether of researchers to research participants , of science to society, or sponsors to host countries (Shapiro and Meslin 2001 ) . Accusations of parachute research and double standards abounded, leading many to rethink the applicability of accepted ethical principles and practices and to consider new contexts. They also questioned whether researchers, sponsors, or governments owed any continuing obligation of care to research participants at the end of a study . The bioethics principles developed over three decades by Beauchamp and Childress ( 2009 ) provided a formidable foundation upon which debates about research and health care could be played out-even in the face of critiques about their adequacy and suffi ciency as moral theory (Clauser and Gert 1990 ) . Other principles have been recommended by scholars (Lavery et al. 2007 ) and organizations (United Nations Educational, Scientifi c and Cultural Organization [UNESCO] 2005 ), but even proponents of principle-based approaches recognized that more was needed to meet challenges in emerging areas of science (e.g., public health genomics and transborder studies) (Lavery et al. 2007 ; Emanuel et al. 2008 ; Macklin 2008 ) .",

The ACTG-076 debate has broadened the question of accountability , recognizing that impoverished and poorly educated populations living with underdeveloped regulatory, health, and social service infrastructures must prompt reassessment of a multinational trial sponsor's ethical obligations . Such reassessment has focused, naturally, on measures that prevent exploitation of vulnerable and desperate individuals in LMICs (e.g., appropriate informed consent , vigilant recruitment practices).

Based on an ethical vision discernable in early Greco-Roman writings, these principles matured in the work of such social contract theorists as Thomas Hobbes , Jean-Jacques Rousseau , and John Locke . The modern view of human rights presupposes that all persons, simply for being human, have inherent dignity. This dignity constitutes the normative foundation for people having certain inalienable rights. The terms inherent and inalienable mean such dignity and rights belong to people naturally and are, certainly, not bestowed by a political authority . According to human rights theory, a political authority has no ethical basis for arbitrarily depriving individuals of these rights (not having granted such rights in the fi rst place). But because some needs are common and not all goals can be met individually, people choose to surrender certain rights to a public authority established to ensure these ends are realized. Hence, a government \u2026 exists to ensure the well-being of the individuals who give up certain rights in exchange for certain protections and benefi ts [\u2026] . The same applies to the community they jointly establish. From this analysis, the traditional roles of government include such things as collective security, the administration of justice , the protection of property and [\u2026] the promotion of the public's health\u2026. (Meslin and Garba 2011 ) This theoretical sketch provides a backdrop to the 1948 U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) , the ethical cornerstone of the human rights system since the end of World War II. Using human dignity as its starting point, the UDHR codifi es a unifi ed ethical vision for preserving a peaceful and just international order while also emphasizing \"social progress and better standards of life\" (U.N. 1948 ). Correspondingly, the UDHR contains rights that are broadly political (e.g., fair trial, free speech, freedom of religion) and others that focus on economic and social conditions (e.g., housing, education, health).",

In addition, the proliferation of non-state actors in global health mentioned earlier (e.g., relief agencies, academic health partnerships, corporations, philanthropies) make coordination and accountability about the right to health more demanding. By and large, governments are the sole entities authorized to sign health-related human rights treaties such as the ICESCR . International treaties typically have mechanisms for ensuring that signatories fulfi ll legal commitments. But as discussed earlier, the diminishing role of governments in national policy and the increasing privatization of public services under globalization (WHO 2002 ) mean that treaty law will likely play a correspondingly smaller role in global health collaboration .

Organizing international action to address human rights violations remains a perennial challenge-exemplifi ed by the intractable situation in Syria following major pro-democracy protests in 2011. But ideological alliances and rivalries during the Cold War made consensus building around such interventions arduous (Eisner 1993 ) . The Balkan and Rwandan confl icts and a growing atmosphere of cooperation in the face of global challenges (e.g., environmental degradation, climate change ) contributed to an increase in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations organized by the international community. These operations, though designed to further human rights , sometimes undermined the target population's right to health .",

To protect individuals against HIV-related discrimination and threat of violence, advocates of the human-rights approach vigilantly oppose the application of standard methods of disease control, which include mandatory testing and partner notifi cation. But this vigilant rights-based approach to HIV prevention , an approach that Bayer ( 1991 ) labelled AIDS exceptionalism , can undermine society's ability and indeed responsibility to control the epidemic. And although public health offi cials are a minority, some argue for mandatory HIV testing (Schuklenk and Kleinsmidt 2007 ) , seeing it as the only way to control the HIV epidemic. Failure to apply standard methods of disease control, some argue, devalues public health and social justice (Frieden et al. 2005 ; De Cock et al. 2002 ) . By treating HIV/AIDS differently than other infectious diseases , AIDS exceptionalism may inadvertently increase stigmatization rather than reduce it (De Cock et al. 2002 ) . Proponents of testing point to its potential to reduce stigma by raising awareness, preventing transmission, expanding treatment , and empowering individuals (Crepaz et al. 2004 ) .",

After successful use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs to treat HIV/AIDS-infected populations , researchers found that daily prophylactic use of these drugs in uninfected individuals who engaged in high-risk activities was also effective in reducing their risk of HIV/AIDS . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted that PrEP could reduce HIV rates for men having sex with men if those at high risk of HIV infection were targeted and if PrEP was used as part of a comprehensive set of preventive services, including regular monitoring of HIV status, adherence, and risk behaviors (CDC 2011 ). Candidates for Truvada should fi rst be tested for HIV to ensure that they are in fact HIV negative before beginning the PrEP program. This innovative prophylactic approach to reducing the likelihood of contracting HIV holds great promise. One study found that Truvada reduced the risk of HIV infection 42 % compared with men taking placebos and having sex with other men (Grant et al. 2010 ) , whereas a second study found that risk fell by up to 75 % compared with serodiscordant couples taking placebos (Baeten et al. 2012 ) . However, Truvada is associated with some side effects, including nausea and vomiting (CDC 2011 ) and possible decreases in bone mineral density (Grigsby et al. 2010 ) .",

Control of TB requires the availability of medication for months of treatment . Procurement of TB medication requires an intact and predictable supply chain.

Then governments typically purchase medications to store in a central facility for regional distribution.

The disease is characterized by sudden onset of severe, watery diarrhea and vomiting. Left untreated, cholera rapidly leads to dehydration and shock. Severe cholera can be fatal in more than 50 % of cases. Prompt treatment reduce s the case fatality rate to less than 1 % (Boore et al. 2008 ) . Treatment primarily addresses the loss of fl uids: patients should be aggressively treated with oral rehydration solution or, if severely dehydrated, through intravenous fl uids. Treatment with antibiotics shortens the course of the disease. Cholera is transmitted through contaminated food or water. In developing countries, where most infections and deaths occur, inadequate sanitation is frequently the cause of the spread of V. cholerae , as untreated fecal matter from cholera sufferers leaks into the water supply. Each year, 3-5 million cases of cholera occur, leading to about 120,000 deaths (Harris et al. 2012 ) .",

Explain why or why not. 5. One possible concern with seeking compensation for the people who contracted cholera is that it may have a \"chilling effect\" on international assistance. For example, if aid agencies believe they are at risk of being sued for unintentionally transmitting disease, they may be deterred from working in a country in the fi rst place . Should the Haitian government or the lawyers representing the victims take this concern into account? Why or why not? ",

The major challenge for public health in the twenty-fi rst century is to simultaneously maintain and upgrade the infrastructure created to improve peoples' lives. Currently, the MENA region faces multiple challenges to its public health achievements, one of which is the impact of sanctions being used against MENA countries to infl uence political behavior. Sanctions-defi ned as mostly economic but also political and military penalties introduced to alter political/military threats and behavior-are employed by the United States and other countries to discourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, bolster human rights , end terrorism , thwart drug traffi cking, discourage armed aggression, promote market access, protect the environment, and replace governments (Haass 1998 ) . Sanctions often involve economic measures , such as restricting or eliminating foreign assistance , freezing countries' assets, imposing export and import limitations, and revoking mostfavored-nation trade status (World Health Organization 2003 ) .",

Yet in the autonomous northern region of Iraq, infant mortality declined from 64 to 59 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality fell from 80 to 72 per 1,000 live births for the same period.

            "text": "Before World War I, economic sanctions were considered acts of warfare that, like military sieges, infl icted suffering on entire populations . Viewed this way, economic sanctions appear ethically suspect from a number of perspectives. Sanctions violate the just war ban on targeting noncombatants, the Kant's philosophy not to use people as means to an end, and the negative right of populations not to be deprived of their means of subsistence (Gordon 1999 ; United Nations 2005 ) . However, after World War I when the League of Nations was created, economic sanctions came to be viewed as a peaceful, diplomatic alternative to war t hat could prevent military intervention (Gordon 1999 ) . This viewpoint holds that to justify sanctions, the benefi ts of avoiding the presumably far greater harms caused by war, civil war, or longterm political oppression must outweigh the harms sanctions impose on a populace. But this grim utilitarian calculus must also consider the probability of the success of sanctions, which generally is low. Pape ( 1997 ) , for example, estimates that sanctions lead to political compliance less than 5 % of the time. More optimistically, Hufbauer et al. ( 2009 ) judge sanctions effective in 34 % of situations used. However, they stress that the success of sanctions depends on many factors including the purpose; the relative economic instability of the country receiving sanctions; whether the country receiving sanctions is part of a broad array of diplomatic, economic, military, and covert measures; and whether the sanctions are being imposed in the context of a broader international coalition (Hufbauer et al. 2009 ).",

Yet, half a century later, many countries still lack adequate human research regulations or regulatory authorities. These regulatory gaps leave research participants, their families, and communities at risk for great harm through sociocultural discrimination , research-related illness, disability, and death and post-experimental medical abandonment. In Nigeria, Pfi zer tested an unapproved drug on infants and children (Abdullahi v. Pfi zer Inc. 2002 ) ; in India , Johns Hopkins tested cancer drugs on patients without proper consent (Sharma 2001 ) ; and other such incidents have been reported (LaFraniere et al. 2000 ) . Even the U.S. National Institutes of Health failed to produce consent forms for experiments on HIV-positive women in developing countries (Public Citizen 1998 ). On a practical and ethical level, debate continues over human research and informed consent (Tri-Council 2010 ; Marshall 2008 ; Nuffi eld Council on Bioethics 2002 ) . While some argue for a single ethical standard for human research Angell 1997 ) , others believe that imposing a global ethical standard irrespective of cultural differences would amount to ethical imperialism (Resnik 1998 ) . The New England Journal of Medicine \"has taken the position that it will not publish reports of unethical research regardless of their scientifi c merit\" (Angell 1997 ) . But like other scientifi c journals, it has found diffi culty in determining what is unethical versus what is culturally appropriate research in different settings.",

Some involve illiteracy; noncomprehension of information ; language and communication barriers; or unfamiliarity with certain scientifi c, medical, or ethical concepts. Other challenges are attributable to complex sociocultural, psychological, or structural elements, such as shared decision making by community members, rather than by an individual (Marshall 2000 (Marshall , 2008 . Some studies, however, take the stance that such challenges do not preclude an individual's ability to understand or voluntarily participate in research studies (Pace et al. 2003 ) . Consequently, in order to ensure that research participation is voluntary , it is important to safeguard a participant's right to refuse or withdraw from a study at any time.",

These can include \"x-rays, endoscopic images, images of organs or tissues taken during an autopsy, still or video recordings of surgical procedures, and microscopic images\" (Tranberg et al. 2003 ) . As long as these remain de-identifi ed, researchers need not obtain informed consent (European Union 1995 ; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2009 ; National Institutes of Health 2007 ). However, in countries lacking adequate research ethics infrastructures, waiving informed consent is problematic at several levels. First, verifying if appropriate consent was obtained becomes virtually impossible. Second, the lack of consent can be medically dangerous for research participants and have legal repercussions for researchers (Flory et al. 2008 ) . Finally, it can complicate the research process by compromising the utility of research samples and data (Wendler 2008 ) .",

The media also raised concerns about inadequate regulation of private trials, inconsistent application of informed consent requirements, and irregularities in ethics reviews (The Hindu 2011 ; The Indian Express 2012 ).Although offi cials have been responsive to these concerns, their efforts still leave the vulnerable unprotected.In 2000, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare established legal guidelines regulating the conduct of research in India that align with international guidelines on research ethics including the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) ( 1996 ), the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2008 ) and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) guidelines ( 2002 ). The Indian Council of Medical Research also developed guidelines specifi cally for clinical trials ( 2006 ). Further, the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules were amended to require review and registration of trials and to compensate trial participants or their families in the event of an adverse event (Government of India 2005 ) . Unfortunately, adverse events go grossly underreported. Few recruits receive compensation, and hardly any investigations result in convictions for unethical research practices .",
