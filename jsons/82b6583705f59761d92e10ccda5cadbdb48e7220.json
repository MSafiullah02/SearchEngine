            "text": "\u2022 Anthrax is still endemic or hyperendemic on all continents in the world, mainly as a zoonosis among unvaccinated cattle [1-6, 13, 33] . It has been known for more than 4000 years and was earlier called \"Black bane\". Natural anthrax in human is associated with contact with sick animals and animal products. The bacterium Bacillus anthracis is producing lethal toxins and spores that can survive in the environments for 100 years or more. Minimum infectious dose is 1-3 spores, and toxin-producing anthrax may cause skin, lung or intestinal anthrax, dependent on the transmission via contact, air or food. The non-skin anthrax has a very high lethality. Today, about 2000 people are infected each year, from eating or handling infected meat. During peace time, there are few incidents of threats using bioterror weapons like anthrax. However, autumn 2001 anthrax was spread in the United States by \"powder letters\" [18, 19] . \u2022 Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis (Enterobacteriaceae), is a zoonotic disease, vector-transmitted from infected rodents to humans via infected insects (fleas and lice) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 8] . It is one of the great historical diseases. In the last 1500 years, plague has killed more than 200 million people during large epidemics (Black Death), especially from the year 1347. Still, plague causes bubonic-glandular pest, lung pest and/or septicaemia in 2000-3000 cases each year, and more than 10 outbreaks (Africa, Asia, Australia, Madagascar) have occurred since the year 2000 [8, 34] . \u2022 Cholera caused by Vibrio cholera is one of the great quarantine diseases, called \"mother of all epidemics\", still very active in Asia and Africa. Cholera is associated with contaminated water, war and nature catastrophes, like in Haiti 2010, with 670,000 cholera cases (profuse diarrhoea) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 35 ]. \u2022 Brucella species (Brucellaceae) are one of the most important zoonotic diseases both for animals and humans all over the world. They easily spread via contact and air from animals and food, survive in the environment for months especially during colder seasons, are very easily transmitted and may cause nosocomial infections, chronic febris undulans, septicaemia and lung diseases. Vaccination of animals may eradicate the zoonotic disease [15] . Brucella are particularly related to laboratory outbreaks but are easily transferable outside the laboratory and are considered highly infectious [36] . \u2022 Francisella tularensis (zoonosis) is defined as a category A bioterrorism agent, highly infectious and increasing in the society, has low infection dose (one to ten bacteria) and can be inhaled or infected via food and water [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 8] . Occasionally, such patients are detected in hospitals, even in the operating department [37] . Tularemia is a zoonotic disease or colonization among wild animals as rodents and hares and may survive at colder seasons for long periods in water, amoebas, birds and insects like ticks. The infection (skin, lung, intestine) is transmitted via contact with infected animals, inhalation of airborne bacteria, contaminated water and ticks. \u2022 Botulism is caused by a bacterial-produced toxin (Clostridium botulinum) that causes paresis and is common in soil as spores [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The disease can be associated with toxin formation in contaminated and poorly canned foods, shrimp fish, bacon, etc. under anaerobic conditions and randomly affects both healthy people and vulnerable groups, such as infants who have had honey infected with the bacterium, which has happened repeatedly [38] . The toxin is the most dangerous we know and is on the list of bioterrorism. \u2022 Family Rickettsiaceae is associated with many different types of small, intracellular microbes that are zoonotic and survive for a long time in the nature and in infected animals, birds, insects, water and amoeba [2, 3, 10] . Coxiella burnetii is a global zoonosis among animals like sheep and goats and may be airborne for several kilometres, causing frequent outbreaks of Q-fever in Europe in more than 4000 cases in the Netherlands during 2007-2010 [10] . Rickettsia species are more than 25 types, and many of them, especially the typhus group, are causing severe diseases. Humans are mostly infected by insects, including ticks from infected wild animals and rodents usually found in tropical or subtropical areas, but climatic changes, lack of good hygiene, war and natural catastrophes may spread these infections. During the period 1881-1920, 30 million people got epidemic typhus, and three million died in East Europe and Russia [2, 3, 10] .",
