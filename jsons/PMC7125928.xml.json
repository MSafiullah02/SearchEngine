Many of the models formulate stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity, which are of great interest recently. The spatial heterogeneity ranges from the uneven probabilities of contacts between the individuals in communities [1], [2], dependence of the strength of the demographical interactions between cities on the distance [3], to nation-wide or world-wide inhomogeneous geographical structures [4], [5].",

In such a simulation, accuracy and reproducibility of the input demographical knowledge such as the amount of traffic between cities have great impacts on the reliability of the output pattern of the movement of pathogens and their hosts. But, in studying world-wide epidemics, just a collection of regular airline routes and aircraft capacities does not always present the transportation network which results in the real chain of transmission. Some routes are influential decisively, but the others are not. Examples are found in the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) from Asia to the world in 2003. There were not any cases in Japan in spite of the heavy traffic there from Asian countries. Many patients appeared in Canada earlier than the United States to which airlines connect Asian countries much more densely. Here arises an interesting question. Inversely, is it possible to learn the effectively decisive transportation network by observing how the disease spreads, reinforce the demographical knowledge on the network, and import the acquired knowledge into the mathematical model? This is an inverse problem similar to the network tomography [6], [7].",

The dataset consists of either the number of infectious persons or the number of new cases per an observation interval. The method is founded on a mathematical model for a stochastic reaction\u2013diffusion process [8]. The population in the model is described by a set of Langevin equations. The equations are stochastic differential equations which include rapidly fluctuating and highly irregular functions of time. Probability density functions and likelihood functions are derived from the equations analytically, and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters. The method is tested with a number of computationally synthesized datasets and the World Health Organization (WHO) dataset on the SARS outbreak in March through April in 2003.",

The state of a recovered patient goes back to S. The parameter \u03b1 represents the probability at which an infectious person contacts a person and infect the person per a unit time. If the contacted person is susceptible, the number of the infectious persons increases by 1. The effective rate of infection by a single infectious person is the product of \u03b1 and the proportion of the susceptible persons within the population. The parameter \u03b2 represents the probability at which an infectious person recovers per a unit time. These parameters are constants over subpopulations and time.

For large \u3008ki\u3009, the naive estimation becomes less erroneous than the random guess. But, it never surpasses the method in this study. The initially heterogeneous node-to-node distribution of infectious persons relaxes more quickly in the networks having more links. For example, the standard deviation of Ii(t99) is about 400 for \u3008ki\u3009=2, and about 300 for \u3008ki\u3009=4, while the mean for both \u3008ki\u3009 is about 550 (\u2248I0(0)exp((\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)D\u0394t)/N). The growing trends also become more homogeneous. Under such homogeneity, the negative correlation implies the movements between nodes directly. The naive estimation may be a substitute if assuming homogeneous distribution during observation are well-grounded.",
