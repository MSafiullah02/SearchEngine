The disease is an infection caused by a coronavirus resulting in a clinical picture of atypical pneumonia.\n1\n Characteristic radiological features on chest radiograph and computed tomography scan could be found in most patients with SARS. The therapeutic regimens consist of antiviral agents such as Ribavirin and large doses of steroids.\n2\n Although most patients recover following this treatment regimen, 14% to 20% of patients develop respiratory failure and require endotracheal intubation and ventilator support.\n2\n, \n3\n\n",

This has posed a significant threat to medical and nursing staff caring for these patients, especially when the patients are receiving ventilator support in which frequent suction of the bronchial secretions is mandatory.",

In the latter circumstance, a surgical airway has to be established as an emergency measure. Spillage of blood and bronchial secretions are expected to be significant during the tracheostomy. Protection of the medical and nursing staff is mandatory when this procedure is performed for patients with SARS or those suspected of having SARS. Medical personnel should be familiar with the guidelines, and all appropriate protective equipment should be available for immediate usage. This will reduce the risk of acquiring the infection during tracheostomy to a minimum.",

The fever persisted, and his chest radiograph showed left\u2010side, lower zone patchy consolidation. Subsequent rapid development of respiratory tract symptoms associated with a low lymphocyte count showed that he was likely to have contracted SARS. This was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analyses of his nasal aspirate, which identified the presence of coronavirus DNA. He was managed with intravenous Ribavirin; however, his pulmonary function deteriorated on day 5 after admission. A decision was then made to carry out endotracheal intubation, which was unsuccessful. The arterial oxygen saturation level of the patient was found to have decreased to 70%. Immediate tracheostomy was required at the bedside in the intensive care unit. His preoperative blood gas values showed a partial pressure of oxygen of 8.8 kPa and partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 4.2 kPa, and the patient was drowsy.",

The cricoid cartilage was quickly identified, and a vertical tracheotomy was performed by cutting the second and third cartilaginous tracheal rings. A No. 7.5 Portex cuffed tracheostomy tube could be inserted with ease and then connected to a ventilator. The entire tracheostomy procedure took 4 minutes. The patient regained consciousness, and his arterial oxygen saturation level returned to 100%. His postoperative blood gas values showed a partial pressure of oxygen of 27.3 kPa and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 5.7 kPa. There was significant coughing and thus spillage of tracheal secretion during tracheotomy and when the tracheostomy tube was being inserted. On completion of the procedure, the gloves, operating gown, N95 mask, goggles, and cap were removed in this order by the surgeon to avoid cross\u2010contaminating other medical and nursing staff.

No goggles were worn. The patient was again positioned with the neck extended. The patient was sedated with 30 mg morphine sulfate and 3 mg midazolam given intravenously. Immediately before the change of the tracheostomy tube, 5 mg vecuronium bromide was given to paralyze the patient. The ventilator was stopped. On removal of the previous No. 7.5 Portex tracheostomy tube, the balloon was found to be leaking. A No. 8 Portex cuffed tracheostomy tube was then inserted smoothly; there was no coughing or spillage of tracheal secretion during the procedure.

The endotracheal tube was removed, and a tracheotomy was performed, followed by insertion of a No. 7.5 cuffed Portex tracheostomy tube. There was no suction used throughout the procedure, and the patient was immobile during the insertion of tracheostomy tube.
